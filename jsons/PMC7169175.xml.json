The WHO\n17\n and CDC case definitions of SARS during the outbreak period relied heavily on epidemiological linkage to increase the specificity of the diagnostic criteria.

However, the constellation of compatible clinical and laboratory findings, together with the rather characteristic radiological features, especially on HRCT, and the lack of clinical response to broad\u2010spectrum antibiotics, should quickly arouse our suspicion of SARS. Until rapid diagnostic tests with a high rate of early detection (e.g. blood SARS CoV RNA using real time RT\u2010PCR technique) become readily available, the diagnosis of SARS will remain a clinical decision in the early stage.",
