Previous studies [[19], [20], [21]] have revealed that other types of coronavirus including SARS-CoV can cause myocardial inflammation and damage via human angiotensin converting enzyme II as receptor. Thus, it is presumed that the novel coronavirus may also lead to myocardial injury and myocarditis in patients with COVID-19. In addition, cytokine storm [6,7,22] is another speculated mechanism that could be caused by coronavirus, presenting as indiscriminate attack of overreacting immune system on many organs including the heart. As the extensively and rapidly spreading of COVID-19, possible myocardial inflammation and injury have always been highly concerned and suspected.

From the clinical standpoint, our study has also discovered that the speculation of myocarditis caused by COVID-19 lacked solid evidence. Except for the patients with pre-existing cardiac disorders and another patient with acute myocardial infarction 4 days after hospitalization, echocardiography didn't present typical signs of myocarditis such as segmental wall motion abnormality, reduced LVEF or wall thickening for the patients with COVID-19 during hospitalization. The only presentation that could speculate myocarditis was the presence of pericardial effusion in some patients, however there was only a small amount of pericardial effusion, which was not specific for myocardial injury but more inclined to systemic causes. In addition, some patients have presented the signs of pulmonary hypertension and it was more likely because of the severe conditions in lungs and acute respiratory distress syndrome. ECG manifestations were also nonspecific for the patients. ST-T changes is common and lacks specificity in older patients, especially those with co-existing cardiac conditions. Tachycardia was more common in patients reached the composite endpoint, which is more likely due to other reasons, such as severe hypoxia. For most of the time during hospitalization, the levels of cardiac troponin I and NT-pro BNP have not elevated. Even the condition of lungs became extremely severe, the changes of the heart were still not obvious for patients with COVID-19, indicating that the novel coronavirus has not presented direct aggression on the heart and it was less likely to be considered as the primary cause for myocardial injury.",

Myocardial injury and heart failure presented before death may be attributed to other reasons, like severe hypoxia induced myocardial ischemia, management of mechanical ventilation or ECMO, multiple organ failure requiring kidney or liver replacement therapies, severe water and electrolyte unbalance or irreversible metabolic acidosis and coagulation dysfunction, which would cause severe systemic disorders in patients with COVID-19. All these conditions may have influences on the heart and cause secondary myocardial injury and heart failure. Though this was not the presence of the novel coronavirus directly attacking the heart, the elevation in cardiac markers should be considered as a warning sign, highly suggesting for recent adverse clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19.
