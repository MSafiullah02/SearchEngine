In the first case, either the 4.5 mm fibrescope was inserted in the nostril together with the HFNO prong (thus resulting in difficult scope movement) or in place of the HFNO prongs. Fibreoptic intubation is known to be more challenging via the oral route in anaesthetized patients due to airway collapse, especially if a dedicated airway is not used. 6 If the nasal route was chosen, removing the HFNO prongs to allow passage of the bronchoscope would have reduced the benefit of apnoeic HFNO and increased aerosolization risk. 2, 7-9 5) Despite being superior in preventing hypoxaemia during rapid sequence induction and intubation HFNO is not recommended in COVID-19 patients 2,8-9 since (awake) fibreoptic intubation is considered an aerosol-generating procedure. It is then paradoxical to state that \"Rapid-sequence fibreoptic bronchoscopic tracheal intubation in patients with COVID19 pneumonia may reduce the risk of viral spread\" 1 , especially if the declared advantage is \"an increase of the distance between anaesthesiologist and patient's airway\". 1 Bronchoscopes with an average length of 65 cm do not allow the 1 m distance considered safe for airborne spreading. 2, [7] [8] [9] A videolaryngoscope (especially with external screen), works with similar distance but has been shown to be faster and to require lower skills 4 , and to have simpler options for rescue intervention 1,2 . The same message comes from the Chinese experience 6 and from worldwide recommendations. 2, 8, 9 In order to maximise first pass success, we recommend a preloaded bougie or stylet, rapid sequence induction with full dose neuromuscular blockade, preoxygenation by continuation of ongoing noninvasive ventilation, and apnoeic low-flow (1-3 L min -1 ) oxygen through standard nasal prongs (NODESAT). 2 patients. Awake fibreoptic intubation remains the gold-standard for predicted intubation/ventilation difficulty, to be used in very selected cases in COVID-19",

            "text": "appears an oxymoron: fibreoptic intubation requires skill and is time-consuming (72-420 s timerange for awake intubation 4 ). Wu and colleagues 1 report mean (IQR) values of 68.5 (62.2-74.0) and 76.0 (68.0-90.5) s for fibreoptic intubation in anaesthetized patients,probably reflecting the skill of the intubating team and the impact of anaesthesia. For a fast procedure, it is still too long not to result in significant desaturation, particularly considering that no oxygen was administered in the control group (in an obvious study comparing oxygen vs non-oxygen), and that \"There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients with minimum SpO 2 >95% during intubation, in the incidence of SpO 2 <80% during intubation\" 1 . In other words, this might mean that in a 30+30 COVID-19 patient sample, either extra oxygen is not useful or that High-Flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO) does not work.3) We do not believe that \"HFNO shortened the duration of intubation. [\u2026] but one possibility is that interruption of attempts at tracheal intubation to carry out rescueface-mask ventilation was less frequently required in the HFNO group.\". HFNO probably reduced the number of attempts at rescue face-mask ventilation, and not the time for fibreoptic intubation, keeping in mind that the control group was not given oxygen.Fibreoptic intubation is considered the gold standard for predicted difficult intubation, the underlying concept being that maintenance of spontaneous breathing preserves oxygenation 5 . Nevertheless, use of a technique requiring longer times for intubation, with higher likelihood of desaturation and need for rescue face mask ventilation (1+8 cases in Wu and colleague's series 1 ) cannot be recommended in COVID-19 patients made apnoeic by neuromuscular blocking agents.",

Given the duration, complexity and aerosolization potential of fibreoptic intubation and the potential low efficacy/high contamination profile of HFNO, we strongly discourage use of the technique proposed by Wu and colleagues 1 in paralyzed COVID-19",
