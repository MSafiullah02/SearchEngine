Prior to the start of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, multiple medical specialties were increasingly beginning to integrate telemedicine services into their clinical workflows. Radiation oncology departments have previously incorporated video-conferencing technology into multiple components of a patient's care (multidisciplinary tumor boards, educational conferences, and even radiotherapy treatment planning)1, but there have only been a handful of reports in other countries on the use of telemedicine to follow cancer patients in rural or underserved areas1, 2, 3. There have been no reports on the use of telemedicine services specifically for radiation oncology but a pilot study was funded by the Radiation Oncology Institute in 2018 to assess the utility of telemedicine as part of a survivorship program4.",

After therapy is completed, patients may be seen for follow-up in-person or via telemedicine. This decision is made by the treating physician only and typically depends on the disease site being treated. For example, prostate cancer patients are seen in-person for the first follow-up visit, after that they are seen via telemedicine with remote monitoring of PSA levels. In contrast, for head and neck patients, follow-up appointments are seen in-person for the first several visits to monitor for disease recurrence and recovery from acute side effects. After that, they are typically seen via telemedicine. The majority of patients seen via telemedicine are prostate cancer patients, which is largely due to disease prevalence. Most telemedicine encounter visits involve patients within the first two years of radiation treatment completion.",

If there are no concerning/alarm symptoms, the inmates will be continued to be followed in-person by their unit providers (where basic labs and imaging can be ordered as needed) as well as their radiation oncologists via telemedicine appointments. If imaging studies are required, they are completed either locally (close to their unit) or at our institution before their next scheduled appointment; the imaging reports are routed to the ordering physician for review and further recommendations. In between telemedicine appointments, if there is any concerning change in the clinical course of an inmate (abnormal symptoms, labs, or imaging findings), the treating radiation oncologist is notified and an in-person appointment is scheduled quickly.",

Due to their protected research status, collecting prospective data from inmates is restricted, but previously reported internal data indicate high degrees of satisfaction for patients, nurses, and specialty physicians.7 The telemedicine system has also served as a way to limit costs in an increasingly expensive healthcare environment; based on the most recent reported data from 2015, Texas spent $4077 per inmate, which is less than the median state expenditure of $5720 and $15,000 less than the state with the highest expenditure, California, at $19,7968.",

Based on our institutional experience, our long-term vision for telemedicine is as an excellent (and cost-efficient) tool to provide long-term follow-up for patients, especially for those who live far away in rural or underserved areas. This would also allow for increased compliance with survivorship programs and better data collection of long-term toxicity and recurrence rates.",
