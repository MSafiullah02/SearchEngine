            "text": "Dengue fever is currently a global health threat. Dengue transmission is ubiquitous throughout the tropics, with the highest risk zones in the Americas and Asia. It is estimated that there are 390 million dengue infections annually.1 The pathogen of dengue fever is the dengue virus (DENV), which is a single\u2010stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Flavivirus genus. DENV is transmitted by Aedes Aegypti. There are four serotypes of DENV (DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4). All of these serotypes can cause mild dengue fever and, in some cases, can lead to life\u2010threatening complications such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS).2 DHF and DSS represent the more severe forms of the disease after DENV infection, and they are commonly reported in children. Other symptoms of DENV infection include fever, low platelet count, hemorrhagic bleeding, and vascular permeability.3 Currently, an effective antiviral therapy or a vaccine for DENV infection is not available. The need to simultaneously immunize and induce long\u2010lasting protection against all four serotypes poses a particular challenge in the development of a vaccine.4 Therefore, there is a continuing and increasing need to develop effective antiviral agents against DENV.",

Lycorine has also been reported to demonstrate broad\u2010spectrum inhibitory activities against several viruses, such as poliovirus,11 severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2010associated coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV),12 herpes simplex virus (type 1),13 vaccinia virus,14 bunyaviruses, Punta Toro virus, and Rift Valley fever virus.15 Lycorine has been previously shown to potently inhibit flaviviruses in an in vitro model.16 Lycorine reduced viral titers of West Nile virus (WNV), DENV, and yellow fever virus (YFV) by 102\u2010 to 104\u2010fold at a concentration of 1.2 \u03bcm. Lycorine primarily exerted its activity through the suppression of viral RNA replication. Mutagenesis studies revealed a single amino acid substitution (Val9Met) in the 2K peptide (which spans the endoplasmic reticulum membrane between the NS4A and NS4B proteins). However, whether the 2K peptide was the direct target of lycorine remains to be determined. Additionally, some synthesized lycorine derivatives have been investigated for their inhibitory activities against WNV. A preliminary structure\u2013activity relationship study indicated that modification of the hydroxy groups at the C1 and C2 positions reduced cytotoxicity, whereas oxidation of the 2\u2010hydroxy group (Figure 1, I) slightly increased the potency. Compounds with an opened E ring (Figure 1, II) and those that were oxidized at the C7 position (Figure 1, III) demonstrated lower activities.16 To discover novel antiviral agents against DENV, a series of lycorine derivatives were synthesized and assayed to study the structure\u2013activity relationships with respect to their anti\u2010DENV activity.",

The nucleophilic attack of the epoxide occurred at the least hindered side with high regioselectivity to afford 25 and 27, similar to a previous report.19 Based on the bioisosterism, we intended to convert the hydroxy group at the C2 position into an amino group. 2\u2010Aminolycorine (26) was obtained through reduction of the azide group of 25 with lithium aluminum hydride in THF.

Generally, the functional\u2010group transformations of the 2\u2010hydroxy group resulted in a loss of activity (Table 2). The ester, ether, and siloxane derivatives resulted in better activities than amino, azide, amide, and triazole derivatives among this series. Based on bioisosterism, the hydroxy group at the C2 position could potentially be converted into an amino group.22 However, amino derivative 26 was much less active than lycorine, as were the azide and amide derivatives 25 and 30. The anti\u2010DENV activity of triazole derivatives 28 and 29 also dramatically decreased. Overall, the results suggested that the 2\u2010hydroxy group plays an important role in the anti\u2010DENV activity.",

The CoMFA contour map of the steric field is presented in Figure 4 a. The green contours indicate favorable regions for a sterically bulky group, whereas the yellow contours indicate less favorable regions for a bulky group. This phenomenon can be observed for compounds 11\u201313, in that their inhibitory activities decreased according to the length of the aliphatic chain at the C2 position and the CoMFA steric\u2010field contour maps for these compounds gradually extended into the yellow region. In contrast, the CoMFA steric\u2010field contour maps for compounds 14 and 15 lie near the green area; therefore, these compounds exhibited relatively high potency. Moreover, the flexibility of the carbon linear chain of 34\u201337 resulted in contours in the green region near the C1 position, which yielded improved activities relative to those of 39\u201341, for which the aromatic substitutions were found in the yellow region. Similarly, in the CoMFA contour maps of the electrostatic field (Figure 4 b), the blue/red regions favored positively/negatively charged groups, respectively. For example, 18 and 19 possessed higher potency than 17 because electron\u2010withdrawing groups (NO2 and Cl) may increase the positive charge of the phenyl ring. This is in contrast to the results for compounds 39\u201341, because negatively charged groups are favored around the C1 position.",
