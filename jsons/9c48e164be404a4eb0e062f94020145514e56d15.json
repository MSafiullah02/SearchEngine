There has been reluctance on the part of the WHO and some governments to recommend this . Methodology . A basic model has been constructed to show the relative risk of aerosol from normal breathing in various situations together with the benefit from use of masks which is multiplicative . Results . Social distancing at 2 metres is validated but in confined areas is time limited and the use of masks in the absence of extremely good ventilation is important. Where social distancing is not possible at all times or an infectious person is in a confined area for a prolonged period there is a higher risk of infection requiring higher grade protection . Conclusions . The use of masks should be factored into models and used at an early stage as widespread use of more efficient masks could have a large impact on control and spread of infection . Public health planning requires stockpiling masks and encouraging everyone to have suitable masks in their household when supplies are normalised . The use of a cloth mask will be better than no protection at all .",

            "text": "Concerning Covid-19 the WHO advice from January 2020 [1] is that masks for the general population are not required except for those with respiratory symptoms. In April this changed to medical masks should be reserved for health care professionals [2] , citing that mask wearing by the public might lead to complacency , however , informing the public that masks are not needed is potentially more damaging . The advice appears to be contradictory to the 2019 document for influenza which states that the approach should be multifaceted including ,'Face masks worn by asymptomatic people are conditionally recommended in severe epidemics or pandemics, to reduce transmission in the community.' , although it does mention the possibility of reduced supply to health professionals and increase in prices as a consequence. [3] Even basic masks can help to prevent droplet spread which the WHO states is the primary spread of Covid-19 together with touching fomites , although aerosol spread is important and not surprising with a relatively high R0 number and findings in SARS and influenza [ 4] . The UK has adopted a similar policy based on having no evidence base that a decision cannot be made . A rapid Cochrane review commissioned by the WHO assessing quarantine alone or with other public health measures to control Covid-19 does not mention masks . [5] A past Cochrane review [ 6] for influenza showed low level evidence in favour of general mask wearing but due to the lack of good quality studies could not make a positive recommendation pointing to compliance issues but these studies do not translate to a pandemic with significant morbidity . A further review by Public Health England concluded that low level evidence suggested there was benefit of masks for health care workers and in the community but community use could not be recommended [7 ] . It seems illogical in a pandemic with significant morbidity that only health care workers need protected when the driving force for their need is the numbers of people from the community being admitted to hospital. Greenhalgh referred to the precautionary principle when there is no evidence for doing something but where the risk of doing nothing could cause considerable harm in relation to recommending the use of masks in the general population [8] and Cowling asked for a rational approach to the use of masks . [ 9] Aerosol spread will be much more in coughing and sneezing , than in speaking or normal breathing , however some individuals produce excessively high amounts of aerosol particles > 10,000 per litre in normal breathing [10 ] which may be one possible mechanism for superspreading . From an observation in influenza [ 11] causing 100% infection in a confined space it was postulated that there must be a relationship between the amount of virus expelled into the air , the ventilation of the area and the time exposed . From this a simple model has been constructed to show the relative benefit of mask wearing in relation to the infectious dose of a virus in aerosol . A Health and Safety review found a 6 times reduction in bioaerosol passing through surgical masks with and estimated 100 times reduction for an FFP3 mask , with much of the inefficiency of surgical masks being due to leakage or poor fit [12] . Cloth masks are acknowledged to give some protection which may only have an improvement factor of 2 . [ 13] Method Infectious dose (ID) is the amount of virus needed to be inhaled to cause infection . Many factors could affect this and the bioavailability of the virus once inhaled together with mucosal defences . A review by Nikitin suggested a figure of 1.9 x 10 3 for influenza [14] . Regarding fine aerosol that can penetrate more deeply into the lungs it is quite possible that a much lower dose is required . For this comparative study an ID at 1000 was used especially as this fitted best with scenario 2 ( Table 2 ) and the original observation . Not all aerosol particles contain virus which may only be 10 % of aerosol but can be more . [15] For this study 30% of particles being infectious was taken at av = 0.3 .",

Scenario 1 ( table 1) shows a high risk being close to someone breathing normally, potentially only for a short time . Wearing a mask will reduce the number of infectious particles which could mean reducing the chance of infection or even having a milder infection . Combining a surgical mask in the infectious and non infected person gives a 2.8 times improvement from a surgical mask only on the non infected person and a 17 times improvement from no mask at all . The more people wearing higher quality masks will give more improvement and less risk of infection . Scenario 2 ( table 2) with two people on a half hour car journey reaching the ID by the end . There is a greatly reduced infectious dose with a non infected person wearing an FFP3 mask but all the masks reduce the ID . Both wearing a surgical mask is of considerable benefit although not as good as FFP3 . Scenario 3 ( table 3 ) shows that an infectious person in a confined area for 3 hours with little or no ventilation will give a high risk of infection when someone enters and the benefit of FFP3 . As there is only a short time benefit from a surgical mask or cloth mask ventilation with clean air is needed for further improvement . Figure1 shows that a steady state in concentration in a restricted volume occurs quickly with 5% of the air being replaced per minute . Such a situation could be a taxi where the driver is not separated from the passengers , or an infectious person in a cubicle with little ventilation . Scenario 4 ( table 4 ) shows a person in an enclosed area with a larger volume for 3 hours and a non infected person entering . This gives a low risk situation but a cloth mask can give an even larger improvement . Scenario 5 ( table 5 ) shows 2 people socially distanced in a confined area such as a work place . It shows how social distancing can work but it is time limited in a confined area which needs to be extended with masks and ventilation over a longer period . Interestingly the effect of both wearing surgical masks was greater than 200 litres per minute ventilation but both combined made an extremely large difference .",

It can reduce aerosol inhalation with varying degrees of efficiency , from cloth to FFP3, all masks will reduce large droplets and reducing both will reduce fomite contamination as wide distribution of virus in infected patients' rooms shows that aerosol deposition is important [23] in addition to droplets and direct touch . Any reduction in the ID could be significant by preventing infection or reducing viral load and degree of infection . [24] The more people wearing higher quality masks in the community will result in more benefit . High risk situations can be identified where greater protection is needed especially where a potentially infectious person is in one place for a long period or people are in close contact even for a short time , then use of masks is important . In addition to masks good ventilation and possibly air filtration can be important , such as in clinical or non clinical work places or anywhere social distancing is time limited by a confined area . Input from health and safety and occupational health agencies could be useful in minimising risk in such places . In areas such as public transport where air borne infections have been found [25, 26] , inside shops where social distancing cannot be fully maintained at all times , or anywhere there is not a large amount of fresh air ventilation , better quality protection is needed . The model suggests validation of strategies already in use such as putting a mask on a patient and ventilation of rooms by opening windows .",

Reductions in infections early on will have considerable benefit due to the number of people each infected person infects . Tracht et al produced a model for influenza that showed even with 50% compliance in the population wearing N95 masks , there would be more than a 36% reduction in the number of cases. [27] They found less benefit for surgical masks but may have underestimated the combined efficiency of wearing surgical masks . Reducing the numbers of infected people early on will give contact tracing and isolation a much better chance to work . Those returning from infected areas should use masks immediately together with isolation . Models in pandemics should include aerosol spread and mask use , noting there was no mention of either in the models published by the UK government . [28, 29] If there is an epidemic with rapid spread in a population with high morbidity a warning is sounding that as soon as any spread out with that country occurs plans for implementing the general use of masks should be engaged . Anytime lockdown is likely masks should already be in general use and would be cost effective even if it is only shortened by a week .",

For Covid-19 the lack of resources is all too evident but a lack of resources should not dictate public health policy , public health policy should ensure resources are available when needed . For masks national stock piles are necessary , high grade protection for the care sector and at least surgical masks for the general population . The more people that can use higher grade protection such as N95 especially on public transport and crowded places the better but if there is a national supply of surgical masks there would be a fall back for those unable to tolerate the higher grade masks or unable to procure them . Manufacturers increasing the shelf life from 5 years to 10 years would make this much more feasible . In addition to a national endeavour once supplies are normalised at a domestic level all households should be encouraged through public health information to keep a supply of good quality masks (N95) that can be used for dusty activities and DIY , then replaced when dirty . Alternatively there are reusable masks such as sports masks which are usually available with PM2.5 2.5 micron pollen or dust filters but could be supplied with additional PM1 O.1 micron filters for pandemics . Exhalation valves are designed to reduce moisture and CO2 in theory but it appears with the current design most valves do not work at low levels of breathing [30] which allows a protective effect in exhaling ; masks without exhalation valves still seem preferable . Improving the exhalation filtering and fit further would improve the combined efficacy of wearing masks .",

Protection against eye risk is not a case against masks , which is more likely when close to someone from droplets compared to aerosol ( taking the study results and the surface area of the lungs compared to the eyes ) .

Where social distancing is not possible at all times or an infectious person is in a confined area for a long time there is a high risk of infection requiring protection . The use of masks should be factored into models and used at an early stage as widespread use of more efficient masks could have a large impact on control and spread of infection . Public health planning requires stockpiling of masks and encouraging everyone to have suitable masks in their household when supplies are normalised .
