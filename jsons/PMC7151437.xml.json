The emerging infectious diseases have the potential to be a public health emergency of international concern and can have major impact on the health and well-being of communities, health systems, steadiness of national economies, and progress toward the sustainable development goals. \u201cEmerging infectious disease (EID) is the one that has appeared and affected the population for the first time or has existed previously or rapidly increasing either in terms of the number of population affected or its spread to the new geographical area\u201d.1, 2, 3 They are considered to be a major public health problem because of its potential to be used as biological warfare agents and can have a devastating effect on animal and environmental health.4\n,\n5 One of the other major challenges in combating these diseases is their unpredictable nature and their ability to assume pandemic proportions.2 Their unpredictable nature also makes it difficult to control the diseases and can cause the spread of infection even across national boundaries.1 The emerging infectious disease accounts for 26% of the death worldwide and 28% of the global burden of infectious disease.1\n,\n3 In South East Asia, out of the 14 million deaths annually, 40% is due to EIDs.1 In India, infectious diseases are responsible for half of the total disease burden.3 For many centuries, infectious diseases such as plague and smallpox have claimed millions of lives.6 These lead to the adoption of various measures of public health importance after many years.6 Series of incidents in succession to these events lead to the establishment of International Health Regulations (IHRs) in 1969.7\n,\n8 But, the requirement for the transformation of IHR was accelerated after the 2002 severe acute respiratory syndrome infection because of its transcontinental transmission.7 Hence in 2005, IHR was evolved into a full-scale framework with the purpose of building international coordination in the face of a public health emergency of international concern.9\n",

Hence to enhance the infectious disease surveillance and epidemiological capacity in the country, the government established the Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) in 2004.10\n,\n2 The project, in the long run, got transformed into a program which was decentralized so that there could be immediate detection and response to an outbreak.10\n,\n2\n",

Purposive sampling was used, and the participants included in the study were hospital administrators, doctors with experience in treating infectious diseases, nursing superintendent, microbiologist, and lab technician. A total of 6 participants were estimated to be included from each of the 9 hospitals; therefore, the sample size was determined as 54. All the hospitals which granted consent to be included in the study were secondary care hospitals. Before the initiation of the study, ethical clearance was sought from the institutional ethics committee. Before the data collection appointments were taken from the participants, the participant information sheet was provided, and informed consent was taken. A predesigned, semistructured, and validated questionnaire was administered, and responses were recorded. The questionnaire had a separate section of questions, one for all the participants (n = 49) and the others specific for administrative staff and doctors (n = 36) and for laboratory personnel's (n = 13). The data analysis was undertaken with the help of Microsoft Excel and was expressed in percentages and frequencies.",
