Therefore, cats were classified as having \u2018high\u2019 or \u2018low\u2019 flea risk based upon state of origin (Jameson et al 1995). Cats from the following geographic areas (states) were categorized as having low risk of flea exposure: Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming. Cats from all other states were considered to have a high risk of flea exposure. Relationships between B henselae serological status (positive or negative) and clinical presentations were first assessed by Fisher's exact test. Additionally, logistic regression was used to assess the influence of serological status, age, and risk of flea exposure on clinical presentation. Cats were grouped into five age classes of approximately equal sample sizes (<2, 2 to <5, 5 to <8, 8 to <11, and \u226511 years of age). Relationships between B henselae titer magnitude and clinical manifestations were assessed by determining median titers for each group and evaluated with Wilcoxon's rank sum test. Significance was defined as P\n < 0.05.",

            "text": "Due to its retrospective nature, there are several limitations to this study. Samples were submitted by multiple veterinary clinicians (both board certified ophthalmologists and general practitioners) and the motivation to submit sera for testing differed among groups. Thus one of the major weaknesses of this study is the lack of a consistent ophthalmic examination among cases. It is possible that the eyes of some cats in the control groups were not extensively examined and may have had uveitis. This difference between groups may be heightened as cats in group 1 were presented for ophthalmic disease and were examined by a board certified ophthalmologist, whereas those in groups 2 and 3 were not. In addition, the complete medical record was not available; therefore, the ophthalmic findings could not be used to accurately classify cats as having anterior uveitis, posterior uveitis, or panuveitis. Due to the association between flea infestation and B henselae, cats in this study were classified into high or low flea risk categories by geographic location (state) and it was shown that presence of Bartonella species antibodies was associated with high flea risk. However, knowledge of the physical presence of fleas would have been more accurate as flea prevalence can vary within states and can also be dependent upon the housing status of individual cats (indoor vs outdoor). Lastly, because there is serological cross-reactivity between B henselae and other Bartonella species, results of the antibody test in this study cannot be used to document specific exposure to B henselae. However, in most studies that have used culture or genetic sequencing to evaluate the Bartonella species causing feline infection in the United States, B henselae is the most common (Guptill et al., 2004, Lappin et al., 2006).",

Cat scratch disease was estimated at 9.3 cases per 100,000 people per year in the United States (Jackson et al 1993). Approximately 5\u201310% of people with cat scratch disease are reported to have ocular manifestations such as Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome, optic neuritis, vitritis, retinitis or anterior uveitis (Ormerod and Dailey, 1999, Wade et al., 2000). It is not known why some people develop ocular bartonellosis and others do not. It may relate to the host response to the organism (Resto-Ruiz et al 2003). However, it also may relate to the strain of B henselae as it appears that some strains are more pathogenic than others (Woestyn et al 2004). Co-infection with other agents may also play a role in some cases. However, cats experimentally coinfected with T gondii, B henselae, and FHV-1 did not develop ocular bartonellosis (Powell et al 2002).",

            "text": "As many as 93% of cats in some geographical regions are seropositive for B henselae with the highest prevalence in warm, humid climates that are well suited to support flea populations (Nutter et al 2004). Due to the high prevalence of serum antibodies in naturally exposed cats, it is difficult to determine how many cats develop clinical disease due to Bartonella species and it is difficult to confirm the diagnosis in individual cats. For example, in one study of clinically ill cats in North Carolina, multiple clinical syndromes were assessed for association with the presence of Bartonella species antibodies. No association was demonstrated for most abnormalities, including ocular disease (Breitschwerdt et al 2005). These results indicate that, as with other causative agents of uveitis (eg, T gondii, coronaviruses, FHV-1), the presence of serum antibodies to B henselae does not correlate with the precise cause of the intraocular inflammation in individual cats (Peiffer and Wilcock 1991). Confirmation of B henselae as the cause of uveitis has been attempted by locating the organism's DNA within the eye by PCR and by detecting local antibody production within the eye (Lappin et al 2000). As Bartonella species is an intraerythrocytic bacterium and most cats with uveitis have some degree of at least microscopic hyphema, the detection of B henselae DNA in aqueous humor does not prove ocular infection. In addition, the organism in erythrocytes could enter the eye via hemorrhage induced during anterior chamber paracentesis. Detection of local antibody production within the eye can be used as an indirect method of diagnosing local tissue infection and has been previously used with T gondii (Lappin et al 1992), FHV-1 (Maggs et al 1999), and B henselae (Lappin et al 2000). Further studies of this type are needed on greater numbers of cats with and without uveitis in order to determine if an epidemiologic association between B henselae and anterior uveitis exists. It is also possible that comparison of serum and aqueous humor B henselae antigen recognition patterns between cats with uveitis and those without ocular disease could identify improved diagnostic parameters (Freeland et al 1999).",

            "text": "Using this study design, there was no difference in seroprevalence between cats with uveitis and cats with non-ocular diseases; however, healthy cats were more likely to be seropositive for Bartonella species than cats with uveitis. Although there was overlap in the magnitude of serum titers and the median serum titers were identical (1:64) in all three groups, the healthy cats were more likely to have higher titers than cats with uveitis. These results suggest that Bartonella species antibody titer magnitude is unlikely to correlate with the presence of disease. Previous studies have found an increasing proportion of cats seropositive for Bartonella species with increasing age which may be related to an increased chance of exposure over time (Chomel et al., 1995, Guptill et al., 2004). In this study, the likelihood of being seropositive for Bartonella species decreased with increasing age. It is unclear why there are differences between these studies; they may merely be due to sample selection. For example, it is possible that older cats in this study were more likely to be administered antibiotics or flea control products.",
