Smallpox was eradicated in 1979 (Fenner et al., 1988), but is still considered to pose the greatest bioterrorist risk due to the lethality and transmissibility of the virus. Influenza epidemics occur each winter, and another pandemic was widely expected to occur sooner or later (Webby and Webster, 2003); the recent pandemic of H1N1 influenza A from Mexico has illustrated how an outbreak of a novel pathogen will begin, and has highlighted the need for more targeted controls. Mathematical tools can be used to model the progression of such pandemics and, with the development of appropriate containment strategies, advise on mitigation of their impact on the general population (Anderson and May, 1991, Keeling and Rohani, 2007).",

Spatial transmission of infectious diseases is facilitated by the large amount of commuter travel undertaken by the working population and other trips undertaken by the non-working population. Travel to work, as well as travel for other reasons, such as shopping and leisure, is not migratory for the most part. Instead, the vast majority of people return home at the end of each day. Previous models in general have not considered such behaviour (with notable exceptions (Keeling and Rohani, 2002)), and this study is designed to explore the impact of movements characteristic of returning travellers on epidemic spread.",

This allows the possibility that a single infectious individual is able to infect two individuals at the same time that are a considerable distance apart (albeit with a very low probability). Metapopulation models offer a compromise between individual-based models and homogenous mixing models, by splitting the population into distinct patches. Homogenous mixing is then assumed within patches which are coupled only weakly (MacArthur and Wilson, Levins, 1962, Rvachev and Longini, 1985). As such they provide a natural way of incorporating spatial structure and heterogeneity into infectious disease models, with a major advantage being that they are amenable to fast simulation and analysis (Watts et al., 2005).",

But, the manner in which coupling is made between patches in a metapopulation setting is crucial for the speed and the extent of the epidemic (Keeling and Rohani, 2002). In reality, transmission occurs between individuals and the coupling between patches can only be through discrete movements of individuals. Movements, if explicitly modelled, are often assumed to be unidirectional, which is unrealistic for much of human travel. Recent studies have shown that regularity and return to the home are common features of human movement (Eagle and Pentland, 2009, Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2009).",

Conversely, random movements within a defined spatial kernel are likely to aid dispersal to other patches resulting in faster spread.",

We also identify potential biases present in the census data and evaluate the effects they can have on model outcome. To this end, the paper is organised as follows. In the Methods section we introduce the model and describe the data used to inform it.

On the other hand, non-workers interact with their home ward, i, at night, and do not have a fixed destination for daytime movement; instead they may travel to ward j on one day, followed by several days in their home ward, followed by a visit to ward k, for example. We model this behaviour by defining the matrix P\nij which represents the expected proportion of non-workers that travels from ward i to ward j during the day. Then, the non-workers travelling from i to j ({V\nij}) are redistributed on each day according to the probability P\nij. In this manner, non-workers from ward i do not necessarily move to the same ward each day, but may move to any ward with a non-zero entry in row i of the P\nij matrix. The expected number of non-workers travelling to ward j during the day is given by \u03a3iPijVi. Since a substantial portion of the non-working population interacts within their home wards during both the day and at night, the diagonal entries of P\nij are non-zero, and tend to be large in comparison to off-diagonal entries.",

By considering the distributions of distance travelled measured in the NTS to that extracted from the census, we can improve our estimate of how people travel for non-work related purposes. In particular, non-work related travel shows a higher proportion of very short and long distance journeys compared to commuter movements, with the intermediate journeys being underrepresented. So, non-commuters are given a probability of moving from i to j on each day, denoted P\nij. We define P\nij initially to be W\nij/\u03a3jWij as given by the 2001 census (see Supplementary Information). This is further weighted by the discrepancy between work and non-work related movements from the National Travel Survey.

For very low values of the distance cut-off (< 1 km) we see that the epidemic does not take off. In this case only within ward infection is possible, and the epidemic is not able to spread beyond the initial seeding ward. For distance cut-offs around 5 km, most wards are eventually reachable, but the speed of the spread is considerably reduced, as only neighbouring wards are generally accessible. Figs. 5 (a) and (b) shows the time evolution of the epidemic seeded in King's Cross (London). The multiple epidemic peaks for low values of distance cut-off correspond to epidemics within densely populated cities, such as London and Birmingham, and later on Liverpool, Glasgow and Edinburgh. With a cut-off beyond 200 km, these individual peaks are undetectable.",

This suggests that movement restrictions will have a limited control impact, echoing previous findings (Cooper et al., 2006). Corresponding, the speed of spread (see Figs. 5 (e) and (f)) decreases monotonically for as the cut-off increases from 5 km and 200 km. Beyond 200 km, the model behaviour becomes indistinguishable (on aggregate) from the full model. This result suggests that the tail of the travel distance distribution does not have a large impact. So, whether we believe that long distance commutes happen every day or not, is not important in the context of this model. This is due to the fact that the number of such movements in the data is very small (See Supplementary Fig. 2a).",

We characterised the epidemic spread through Great Britain by final attack size and early growth rate. The type of assumptions made when incorporating these data into models can be extremely important. By far the simplest assumption would be to couple census wards with data taken directly from the census, neglecting any non-work related travel. An important finding of this work is that the presence of irregular movements, in addition to regular commuter-type movements, increases the speed at which the epidemic spreads through the country. For both influenza and smallpox parameters and in certain seeding scenarios, the speed of spread can be increased by almost 25% when random movements are included to the level indicated by the NTS.",

Since the data are aggregated to ward level, even though the homogenous mixing assumption is unrealistic, it provides a parsimonious first approximation. Networks of human contact are highly heterogeneous and their structure has strong implication for the spread of disease (Keeling and Eames, 2005), which will remain true within and between wards. Higher order structure implied by the presence of households, workplaces or schools will further alter disease dynamics. Nevertheless, our current model is capable of capturing the spatial spread of disease in Great Britain, despite these simplifying assumptions and has allowed us to explore the effect of plausible ranges of behaviour.",

Our result showing that spread is faster when considering random movements implies that studies of control strategies which rely on standard assumptions may overestimate their impact. A slower assumed spread of infection is likely to make any testable control strategy appear to be more effective than in reality. Furthermore, if all movements are assumed to be regular, one can have more confidence in choosing wards for intervention. When random movements are introduced such a statement must necessarily become less strong due to the uncertainty of movement destinations. Thus, we suggest that the presence of random movements will need to be taken account of when designing realistic containment strategies.",
