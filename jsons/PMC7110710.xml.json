            "text": "Hajj pilgrimage has long been associated with enhanced transmission of infectious disease agents. Epidemics of cholera [1] and bacterial meningitis [2,3] are emblematic examples of the potential for international spread of life-threatening infections at the Hajj, given its international component with pilgrims originating from up to 180 countries and gathering in Mecca before returning to their home country [4]. More recently, respiratory tract infections at the Hajj have attracted the attention of the medical community because of the frequency of respiratory symptoms among pilgrims consulting at primary health care facilities or hospitalized in Saudi Arabia [5]. Cohort studies conducted in populations of pilgrims originating from different countries reported that a substantial proportion of pilgrims suffer from respiratory symptoms during their stay in Saudi Arabia [6]. On the other hand, numerous PCR-based studies have demonstrated the frequent acquisition of respiratory viruses following participation in Hajj [7,8]. Fortunately, SARS-CoV and MERS-Cov did not affect Hajj pilgrims so far [9,10]. However, rhinovirus, non-MERS coronaviruses and influenza viruses are commonly isolated from both asymptomatic returning pilgrims and pilgrims with acute respiratory symptoms [7,8]. Due to the lack of detailed clinical information in many Hajj studies and the high sensitivity of PCR tools, the contribution of viruses to observed symptoms remains unknown.",

The study was conducted among French Hajj pilgrims traveling together to Mecca, from August 27th to September 20th, 2016, with one specialized travel agency in Marseille. Pilgrims older than 18 years were included on a voluntary basis, and participants were asked to sign a written consent form. Upon inclusion, the participants were questioned using a standardized pre-travel questionnaire that included demographic and chronic disease data and vaccination status. Health issues were recorded by a medical doctor who travelled with the group of pilgrims. We considered that participants suffered RTIs if they presented with cough and/or rhinitis and/or sore throat. Influenza like illness (ILI) was defined as the association of cough, sore throat and fever [11]. Each individual was classified in one of the three categories: i. asymptomatic (those who did not experience any respiratory symptoms during the entire stay in Saudi Arabia), ii. resolved respiratory tract infection (RTI) (those who experienced respiratory symptoms including cough and/or sore throat and/or rhinitis and/or voice failure during travel, but who recovered at the time of return to France and iii. ongoing RTI those with ongoing respiratory symptoms at the time of leaving Saudi Arabia).",

Nasal swabs were also performed among symptomatic pilgrims who spontaneously consulted the accompanying medical doctor at the time of onset (per-Hajj specimens). No per-Hajj sample was collected among asymptomatic pilgrims. Samples were collected using commercial rigid cotton-tipped swab applicators (Medical Wire & Equipment, Wiltshire, UK) which were inserted in the anterior nose and then placed in viral transport media (Sigma Virocult\u00ae). This standardized procedure was previously explained to the pilgrims by the investigators. The swabs were stored at 20 \u00b0C before being transported to the Marseille laboratory for storage in a freezer at \u221280 \u00b0C within 48 h of collection for pre- and post-Hajj samples. Per-Hajj specimen were kept at 20 \u00b0C until the return to France.",

Seven of the 21 symptomatic pilgrims had ILI and their carriage rate did not significantly differ from that of other ill pilgrims (data not shown). Of the 21 pilgrims sampled at the time of symptom onset, 19 were resampled before leaving Saudi Arabia, allowing the proportion of individuals who allowed their viral transport back to the country to be calculated. The mean time between onset of symptoms and testing on leaving KSA was 15.4 days (ranging 8\u201319). Rhinovirus/enterovirus carriage was cleared in 70.6.1% cases, coronavirus 229E carriage in 71.4% cases and influenza virus A carriage in 100% cases, while the majority of cases were still symptomatic (71.4%) (Fig. 3\n).",

            "text": "We observed both a high frequency of respiratory symptoms during the pilgrims\u2019 stay in KSA (76.2% cough and 22.9% ILI) and a significant acquisition of viral nasal carriage (40.0%), mostly due to rhinovirus/enterovirus and coronavirus 229E. This corroborates the results obtained from most recent studies conducted among French pilgrims by our team and among pilgrims from other nationalities [[14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]]. The epidemic curves of onset of symptoms and virus carriage in samples obtained at onset of symptoms suggest an early acquisition of respiratory virus during the initial stay in Mecca, probably due to inter-human transmission as attested by the bi-modal pattern of the curves during this period of time. Crowded conditions at Al-Haram Mosque during the rituals, with up to 8 individuals per m2 recorded close to the Kaaba [23], is likely to play a significant role in this process. Asymptomatic carriage of rhinovirus/enterovirus and coronaviruses was frequently observed when tested in returning pilgrims. Nevertheless, overall viral carriage in patients with ILI on return (75.0%) was significantly higher than in individuals without ILI (42.5%), which suggests that viruses play a role in the pathogenesis of the RTIs. Viruses were detected in almost all 21 pilgrims sampled at symptom onset, which reinforces this view. However, while most of these 21 pilgrims were still symptomatic at the post-Hajj sampling time; only a low proportion of those testing positive at onset remained positive in post-Hajj samples two weeks after first symptoms. These results, although based on small numbers of ill pilgrims clearly demonstrate that sampling at the time of leaving KSA results in underestimation of viral carriage in relation with symptoms during the stay because the majority of ill pilgrims already cleared their viral infection despite persisting symptoms, as observed in our survey. Since obtaining respiratory samples at onset of symptoms is challenging in the context of longitudinal cohort survey at the Hajj, most studies conducted so far were based on systematic samples obtained at the time of return, days after the onset of symptoms occurred. Such a design evaluating viral carriage at return provides useful on the potential for respiratory viruses to spread upon return to the country of origin, assuming that some of the viruses detected by PCR are viable. It is however less appropriate for retrospectively investigating the responsibility of viruses in respiratory symptoms experienced during the stay in Saudi Arabia, given the rapid virus clearance. This was particularly obvious in our survey with a proportion of influenza A virus positivity of 2.0% in pilgrims screened on return, regardless of symptoms contrasting with 20% in pilgrims who actively consulted our medical investigator sampled at respiratory symptom onset. Studies conducted in different countries from 2009 through 2015 with the aim of screening influenza virus by PCR among returning pilgrims regardless of symptoms, reported a mean influenza carriage rate of 3.4%, ranging 0.4\u20137.8% [14,15,19,[23], [24], [25], [26]], which is in line with the results reported here (1.9%). When similar screening studies were conducted, enrolling only pilgrims with respiratory symptoms on returning to their home country, a higher proportion of 10.6% influenza carriage was observed, ranging 3.0\u201314.5% when we found a slightly lower proportion of 2.1% in this study [[27], [28], [29], [30], [31]]. Finally, in studies conducted in sick pilgrims seen in Saudi or European hospitals for suspected MERS-Cov infection and therefore suffering from more severe respiratory symptoms, the percentage of confirmed influenza infection was 34.9%, ranging from 12.0 to 71.4% [21,[32], [33], [34], [35]].",
