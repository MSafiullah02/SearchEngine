A global study (conducted under the auspices of the U.S. National Academy of Medicine) was completed shortly before the 100-year commemoration of the 1918 pandemic. 5 The study concluded that although there are enormous uncertainties in modeling the risks of infectious disease crises, the case for more action is compelling no matter how the risks are calculated.",

This is also a familiar dilemma in the process safety world. Convincing final decision-makers on the importance/urgency to address risk scenarios which have very high impact, but which are perceived to be very low probability (infrequent events measured in once in a lifetime + ) is never easy. It requires building strong technical and economic arguments, effectively communicating the basis for the assessment and the accuracy of the predictions, and building the technical competence and trust in the target audience required to process the information. This requires a great amount of preparation/effort in order to get commitment for the necessary capital and personnel.",

According to Taleb, a Black Swan event has three attributes: \"First, it is an outlier, as it lies outside the realm of regular expectations, because nothing in the past can convincingly point to its possibility. Second, it carries an extreme impact (unlike the bird). Third, despite its outlier status, human nature makes us concoct explanations after the fact, making it explainable and predictable.\" Application of the Black Swan concept to process safety was advanced in a 2012 article in Process Safety Progress entitled \"Beware of the Black Swan: The Limitations of Risk Analysis for Predicting the",

Modeling studies of global economic impact have also been done using virus pandemic scenarios with different degrees of virulence (disease severity) and infectiousness (ease of transmission). 9 The models show significant economic impacts, driven by factors such as reduction in global tourism, workers staying at home to avoid infection, and supply chain interruptions as different regions are affected at different timings.With multiple warnings from experts in epidemiology and related public health fields that a major pandemic is not a question of if, but only of when-the current pandemic cannot be viewed as a Black Swan. It does not meet Taleb's first criteria of \"lies outside the realm of regular expectations, because nothing in the past can convincingly point to its possibility\". The caveat is that the pandemic is still evolving and could take a surprise turn before it is finished. But if nothing appears which would satisfy Taleb's first criteria, then our conclusion would remain unchanged.",
