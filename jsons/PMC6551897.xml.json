Cornelius Celsus described four cardinal signs of inflammation in one concise sentence: \u201cNow the signs of an inflammation are four: redness (rubour) and swelling (tumour), with heat (calour) and pain (dolour)\u201d [1]. A century and a half later, Galen added a fifth sign: \u201cdisturbance of function\u201d (funcio laesa) [2]. The classical signs of inflammation are considered to be related to cells and tissues responding to pathological cell injury caused by internal stimuli, including damage-associated products and metabolites, and external stimuli, including bacteria and viruses [3\u20136].",

            "text": "There are several known PRRs: Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and C-type lectin receptors (CLRs). The majority of NOD-like receptors such as NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRC4, NLRP6, and NLRP12 can interact with apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase-recruitment domain (ASC) and caspase-1, and the resulting complex is a sensor of cell injury called \u201cinflammasome\u201d, an interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2-processing platform that plays a crucial role in IL-1\u03b2 maturation and secretion from cells. Other pyrin-domain (PYD)-containing proteins such as AIM2, IFI-16, and pyrin are also known to form inflammasomes. Among them, NLRP3 inflammasomes monitor membrane integrity and pore-forming toxins, crystals, and many other noxious stimuli and are involved in IL-1\u03b2 processing and maturation [11\u201314]. It is now widely accepted that an inflammatory response is the extreme end of a spectrum that ranges from a homeostatic state of inflammation to a stress response and finally inflammation [8, 15]. The homeostatic state of inflammation, which is not inflammation from the perspective of general pathology, was suggested to be maintained by PRRs expressed in stromal and/or immune cells, detecting endogenous ligands in parenchymal cells and/or pathogens, leading to chronic inflammatory responses ranging from the basal homeostatic state to disease-causing inflammation [15, 16]. In addition to several forms of inflammation including classical inflammation, homeostatic inflammation, a distinct nomenclature for low-grade inflammation, such as para-inflammation (an adaptive response against stress or malfunction) and meta-inflammation (metabolically triggered inflammation), has been proposed [17\u201319]. As discussed above, there are various factors involved in forms of inflammation; in particular, since IL-1 is a downstream cytokine of the sensor of cell injury, the inflammasome, it is important for regulating inflammation and tissue damage beyond inflammation [20].",

Although the homology between IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 is not high (27%) in terms of amino acid sequences, IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are structurally similar and show the same functions by sharing a common receptor, IL-1 type 1 receptor (IL-1R1), and both have the same central \u03b2-barrel along with adjoining loops [35, 36]. The difference between IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 is an N-terminal extension of 14 residues beyond the N-terminus of IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 [37]. The molecular weight of each precursor is approximately 31 kDa, and IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are processed by specific proteases to mature forms. The N-terminal domain of IL-1\u03b1 contains a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and shows transcription activity [38]. IL-1\u03b1 is produced as a 271-amino acid (AA) precursor protein. For transcription of the IL-1\u03b1 gene, transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1) activates the IL-1\u03b1 promoter activity in the 5\u2032-upstream GC box (\u2212 60 to \u2212 45 bp) [39] and NF-\u03baB, which is also activated by IL-1\u03b1 itself, and stimulates the consensus promoter region (\u2212 103 to \u2212 70 bp) to induce its own gene expression and production in an autocrine manner [40]. The precursor of IL-1\u03b1 translocates into the nucleus to bind to chromatin and also exists in a membrane-anchored form. Upon stress responses, IL-1\u03b1 is processed by Ca2+-dependent protease calpain or other proteases, such as cytotoxic T- lymphocytes (CTL)/natural killer (NK)-granzyme-B, mast cell chymase, or neutrophil elastase to the C-terminal 159 AA as mature IL-1\u03b1 [41]. The IL-1\u03b1 processing separates NLS from its precursor, which is not linked to secretion or cell death [21]; however, IL-1\u03b1 is a key danger signal that induces inflammation on release from necrotic cells [42]. The IL-1\u03b1 precursor triggers IL-1R1 on resident macrophages in necrotic tissues, producing IL-1\u03b2 as well as chemokines as post-necrotic inflammation [43].",

The IL-1\u03b2 precursor is also processed by other serine proteases [45]. Neutrophils derived from caspase-1-deficient mice release mature IL-1\u03b2 processed by elastase in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation [46]. The neutrophil proteases, such as elastase, chymases, granzyme A, cathepsin G, and proteinase-3, cleave the IL-1\u03b2 precursor into a secreted, biologically active form [47\u201349]. These alternatively cleaved forms of functional IL-1\u03b2 were detected in synovial fluid of a patient with inflammatory polyarthritis and gout [50]. Occasionally, massive neutrophil infiltration appeared in excess-inflammation-damaged tissues and organs, such as in septic shock or systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Thus, the NLRP3 inflammasome-related inflammation induced by a variety of factors described above may be a target of anti-IL-1 therapy [51].",

            "text": "Currently, a two-step model of the initiation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation is suggested. The first step mediates transcriptional and post-translational priming of NLRP3 (Step1), and the second step is activation of inflammasomes (Step 2). Step 1 is the first synthesis of a biologically inactive IL-1\u03b2 precursor by NF-\u03baB binding to the consensus binding site (\u2212 296 to \u2212 286 bp) to transcribe the IL-1\u03b2 gene. Step 2 is processing into mature, biologically active IL-1\u03b2 by caspase-1 activated by a cytosolic activation platform called inflammasome [52, 53]. The inflammasome is a large protein complex, which consists of PRRs, such as NLRs, AIM2, RIG-I or pyrin, an adaptor protein ASC, and caspase-1. Among them, the NLRP3 inflammasome is a prototype inflammasome, which has been reported to be activated by a wide range of PAMPs and DAMPs [54, 55]. Various NLRP3-activating PAMPs have been reported, i.e., bacteria-derived RNA or DNA, pore-forming toxins, lethal toxins, flagellin/rod proteins, muramyl dipeptide (MDP), M2 protein, virus-derived RNA or DNA, fungus-derived \u03b2-glucans, hypha mannan, zymosan, and protozoon-derived hemozoin [56]. NLRP3-activating DAMPs have also been reported, i.e., self-derived glucose, \u03b2-amyloid, hyaluronan, ATP, cholesterol crystals, monosodium urate (MSU) crystals, calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals, environment-derived alum, asbestos, silica, alloy particles, UV radiation, and skin irritants [56]; however, their diverse physiological and chemical signals leading to the direct activation of NLRP3 have not been fully elucidated. Instead, efflux of potassium has been identified as the common activator of most known NLRP3 step 2 signals [57, 58]. The NLRP3 activation by potassium efflux suggested to lead NLRP3-Nek7 interaction to drive inflammasome activation [59\u201361]. The mechanism underlying the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 has been suggested to overlap with IL-1\u03b1 secretion [41]. Also, mitochondrial and phagosomal reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been proposed to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. Alternatively, non-canonical pathways of NLRP3-inflammasome activation associated with proinflammatory caspases, caspase-4, caspase-5, and caspase-11 have been proposed. In this process, LPS is recognized by the caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) of respective caspases, leading to activation [62\u201365]. Caspase-8 or proteases in neutrophils are also processed and activate IL-1\u03b2. Several PRRs, such as NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRC4, pyrin, and AIM2, convert the assembly of the adaptor molecule ASC into a high-molecular-weight complex, called the pyroptosome [66]. Then, the caspase-1 precursor is recruited to the pyroptosome to also form helical structures, which enable its proximity-induced proteolytical auto-activation. With caspase-1 precursor maturation into the active p102/p202 heterotetramer, it cleaves the IL-1\u03b2 precursor, leading to pyroptotic cell death. This cell death is mediated by the caspase-1-dependent cleavage of gasdermin-D (GSDMD) [67\u201369]. In turn, the mature N-terminal fragment of GSDMD translocates to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane to form round and pore-like structures of approximately 15 nm in diameter [70\u201373].",

IL-1 binds to IL-1R1, which requires the formation of a heterodimer with the IL-1 type 3 receptor (IL-1R3) (also known as IL-1RAcP) accompanied by adaptor IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) and myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88) [76]. IL-1R1 initiates inflammatory responses when binding to the ligands IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 and has been reported to be expressed by T- lymphocytes, fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells. IL-1R2, which does not initiate signal transduction, is expressed in a variety of hematopoietic cells, especially in B- lymphocytes, mononuclear phagocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and bone marrow cells. Notably, expression levels of IL-1R1 and IL-1R2 are different among the cell types; for example, neutrophils predominantly express IL-1R2. As a result, much higher concentrations of IL-1\u03b2 are required to activate neutrophils, whereas low concentrations of IL-1\u03b2 are sufficient to activate endothelial cells. The IL-1R1-mediated signaling pathways also differ according to the cell types [77, 78]. IL-1R3 is a co-receptor for IL-1R1, responsible for signaling after binding ligands IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, and has been reported to be ubiquitously expressed by all cells responsive to IL-1. IL-1R3b is a brain-specific isoform of IL-1R3 generated by alternative splicing, and it has been reported to be expressed in the brain, cerebellum, and spinal cord [79].",

The proximity of the two cytoplasmic domains of IL-1R1 and IL-1R3 is thought to initiate signal transduction by the hydrolysis of GTP. This is followed by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAP kinase [83].

NLRP3 inflammasomes have also been reported to be involved in low-grade subclinical inflammation induced by chronic exposure to high levels of free fatty acids and glucose, leading to increased apoptosis and impaired insulin secretion of \u03b2-cells in obese type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) patients [102\u2013104]. Indeed, islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) oligomers activated NLRP3 inflammasomes to induce significant IL-1\u03b2 production by infiltrating macrophages in an in vivo study [105, 106]. Higher concentrations of glucose activate NF-\u03baB and IL-1 precursors in cells [102]. Minimally oxidized low-density lipoproteins stimulate TLR4, which triggers IL-1\u03b2 expression [104, 105], and accumulations of islet amyloid polypeptides are deposited and mediate NLRP3 inflammasome activation in islet macrophages [107]. Another oligomer of amyloid, amyloid \u03b2, can induce IL-1\u03b2 via NLRP3 inflammasomes in a process involving the phagocytosis of amyloid \u03b2 in glial cells in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and subsequent lysosomal damage and release of cathepsin B [108]. ROS are considered to be involved in the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes, and it was suggested that direct interaction between amyloidogenic peptide and NLRP3 could initiate NLRP3 inflammasome formation in a cell-free system [109, 110]. Both IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 gene polymorphisms have been reported to be associated with central obesity and metabolic syndrome in a population with coronary heart disease in an epidemiologic study [111]. Thus, these diseases are IL-1-dependent cytokinopathies (interleukinoneopathies).",

Consequently, IL-1\u03b2 promotes the differentiation of monocytes into conventional dendritic cells (DCs) and M1-like macrophages and supports the proliferation of activated B- lymphocytes and their differentiation into plasma cells [116\u2013118]. IL-1 in combination with IL-2 promoted not only the expansion of NK cells but also CD4+ CD8+ T-lymphocytes [119]. IL-1\u03b2 generated by activated antigen-presenting cells (APCs) induced type 1 immune responses, which produced CTL and led to the polarization of CD4+ T -lymphocytes towards T-helper cell type 1 (Th1) [120, 121].",

            "text": "IL-1\u03b2 plays a role in resolving acute inflammation resulting in the initiation of adaptive anti-tumor responses; however, chronic inflammatory conditions increase the risk of developing cancer [122]. In human breast cancer, higher expression of IL-1\u03b2 is associated with tumor invasiveness and aggressive tumor biology [123]. Expression of IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and their receptors in human breast cancer tissues results in the activation of a population of cells and subsequently contributes to angiogenesis, tumor proliferation, and tumor invasion in the microenvironment [124]. In a spontaneous MMTV-PyMT mouse mammary gland tumor model, mature IL-1\u03b2 levels in primary mammary tumors and metastasis sites were significantly elevated, being associated with inflammasome activation and the infiltration of myeloid cells in tumor microenvironments. In this model, CD11b+Gr1+ and CD11b+Gr1\u2212 myeloid cell populations were also significantly increased in both tumor tissues [31]. IL-1\u03b2 generated in a tissue with a tumor microenvironment dominated by TAMs promotes tumor growth and metastasis in breast cancer [122, 125]. IL-1, by promoting MDSCs and sustaining the immunosuppressive activity of TAMs, contributes to the suppression of effective adaptive anti-tumor immune responses [126]. Actually, the sphingolipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) on TAMs promotes lymphangiogenesis and lung metastasis via NLRP3/IL-1\u03b2 in mouse breast cancer model [127]. For example, obesity induces an increase in tumor-infiltrating MDSCs with activated NLRC4 inflammasome, leading to IL-1\u03b2 production, which drives tumor progression through adipocyte-mediated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) A expression and angiogenesis [128]. A recent report showed that IL-1\u03b2 orchestrates tumor-promoting inflammation in patients with high-risk HER2-negative breast cancer who would benefit from IL-1-blocking therapeutics with anakinra (described later on). The report indicates that while anakinra downregulates gene expressions for IL-1\u03b2, IL-1R1, IL-1R2, and IL-1R3, increased gene expressions of NK cells and CTLs are observed [129].",

Anakinra is the pharmaceutical name of a recombinant form of intrinsic human IL-1Ra, a 17.2-kDa protein consisting of 153 amino acid residues. IL-1Ra was first reported in 1985 as a bioactive IL-1 inhibitor of 22\u201325 kDa in the supernatants of human monocyte culture, and it was independently identified as an IL-1 inhibitor from the urine of febrile patients [148, 149]. Anakinra was the first biological drug of a selective IL-1R1 antagonist to receive approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Since anakinra is an IL-1 receptor antagonist, it can prevent the activity of both IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 by competitively blocking their binding to IL-1R1 and IL-1R2. Anakinra has been applied for a wide range of diseases including autoinflammatory diseases, non-cancer inflammatory diseases, and malignancies [150]. To date, no serious adverse effect of anakinra has been reported [151].",

Rilonacept binds to both IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 with high affinity and inhibits the activity of both with a long-term inhibitory effect. Rilonacept was first approved by the FDA for the treatment of CAPS in 2008. Subcutaneous injection with a loading dose and a weekly injection of half the loading dose was administered [154]. There are no known severe adverse effects of rilonacept due to IL-1 signaling inhibition. These drugs could modulate the immune response. The most common side effects (> 10% of treated patients) are inflammation of the upper respiratory tract or sinuses, headache, and redness at the injection site [154].",

Thus, IL-1\u03b1 may be a particularly important target for the treatment of cancer. A neutralizing true human IgG1\u03ba monoclonal antibody specific for human IL-1\u03b1, MABp1, has been developed, and it was well-tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities or immunogenicity [160, 161] (Fig. 1). MABp1 treatment for patients with advanced colorectal cancer in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study revealed that MABp1 improved clinical performance in patients with advanced colorectal cancer [161]. MABp1 is a promising treatment for patients with hidradenitis suppurativa not eligible for the anti-TNF-\u03b1 antibody adalimumab [162].",

            "text": "The recombinant human IL-1-receptor antagonist anakinra is markedly effective against CAPS such as MWS, FCAS, and NOMID/CINCA. Weekly rilonacept treatment markedly improved the clinical symptoms of CAPS and normalized the levels of SAA in those at risk of developing amyloidosis [90, 153, 173, 174]. In several case reports of patients with FMF, anti-IL-1 treatment with anakinra, canakinumab, or rilonacept in colchicine-resistant patients was highly effective [175\u2013178]. It was also reported that there was a rapid and lasting response of pyoderma gangrenosum to targeted treatment with anakinra in a patient with PAPA syndrome [179]. Anakinra and canakinumab therapies were also reported to be effective in patients with MKD/HIDS [180]. In the case of TRAPS, although TNF-\u03b1 is considered to be mainly involved in clinical manifestations, marked improvement following IL-1\u03b2 blockade occurred [112, 181]. An open-label, phase II study was reported whereby 19 patients with active recurrent or chronic TRAPS (19/20, 95%; 95% CI 75.1% to 99.9%) achieved the primary efficacy endpoint. Canakinumab treatment for TRAPS rapidly improved the median time to clinical remission to 4 days (95% CI 3 to 8 days) [182]. Skin findings also promptly improved upon anakinra treatment in a patient with DIRA [183]. Monotherapy involving canakinumab for the treatment of FMF has been reported [184]. A nationwide report on IL-1 treatment of patients with FMF revealed that 172 FMF patients (83 [48%] female; mean age, 36.2 years [range, 18\u201368]) were included; the mean age at onset was 12.6 years (range, 1\u201348), and the mean colchicine dose was 1.7 mg/day (range, 0.5\u20134.0). Anakinra was administered to 151 patients, and canakinumab was administered to 21 patients. Anti-IL-1 treatment was used in 84% of colchicine-resistant patients and 12% of amyloidosis patients. During the mean of 19.6 months of treatment (range, 6\u201398), the attack frequency per year was significantly decreased (from 16.8 to 2.4; P < 0.001), and symptoms of 42.1% of colchicine-resistant patients with FMF were ameliorated. In this study, the complete remission rate was 40% and inefficacy rate was 8% in patients treated with anakinra, whereas the complete remission rate was 65% and inefficacy rate was 6% for patients treated with canakinumab [185]. Although the response rates were not significant (P = 0.144 and \u03c72 = 3.872606) in the study above [185], in our opinion, long-acting canakinumab may be more efficacious than anakinra, considering the necessity of daily subcutaneous anakinra injection because of its short half-time clearance of less than 12 h [185].",

On the other hand, its efficacy and safety are insufficient, precluding use for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus or Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, and IL-1\u03b2 inhibition using canakinumab had no effect on the decline in \u03b2-cell function after diabetes onset in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus resulting from autoimmune-mediated \u03b2-cell loss [190\u2013194]. As for RA, the enhanced release of other proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 plays important roles in the inflamed synovium of RA patients [195]. In patients for whom TNF-\u03b1 blockers are contraindicated, anakinra is effective in controlling the disease activity of RA and has been licensed for treatment at a dose of 100 mg/day by subcutaneous injection every day [196, 197]. Compared with anakinra, TNF inhibitors, such as the anti-TNF-\u03b1 monoclonal antibody infliximab, or etanercept that fuse the TNF receptor to the end of the IgG1 antibody, dominate the field of biologics for RA because of the sense of well-being experienced by patients within hours of treatment [198]. Tocilizumab, a humanized anti-IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) monoclonal antibody, has also been shown to improve the symptoms of patients with RA [199]. However, those agents are associated with the risk of reactivating bacterial pathogens such as tuberculosis (TB) and malignancies [197]. Notably, no cases of TB reactivation were reported in 7964 RA patients after anakinra treatment, whereas 8 cases of TB reactivation were reported in 10,281 RA patients after tocilizumab treatment, and 7 and 10 cases of TB reactivation were reported in 2626 and 3167 RA patients after TNF-inhibitor treatment with golimumab and certolizumab pegol, respectively. This suggests the low risk of TB reactivation in RA patients treated with anti-IL-1 therapy [197].",

Moreover, treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer-related with anakinra eliminates a systemic transcriptional signature of IL-1-associated inflammation in blood cells.

Eighty-nine adverse events were recorded; 13 (14.61%) were classified as serious adverse events during a mean follow-up of 24.39 \u00b1 27.04 months. [214]. In addition, anakinra is applied to metastatic cancer. A trial involving metastatic colorectal cancer patients showed significantly increased survival when anakinra was added to standard chemotherapy for colorectal cancer and patients with HER2-negative breast cancer [129, 215]. The IL-1 blockade will reduce IL1-driven inflammation and immunosuppression that may contribute to the tumor metastatic microenvironment [216]. The timeline of therapeutics is summarized in Fig. 2.",

In addition, we also described recent expanding IL-1 signal-targeting for the treatment of diseases. Once the balance of IL-1 signaling is disrupted, it may markedly contribute to the pathogenesis of not only inflammatory disease, but also malignancies. IL-1-targeted biologics have been expanding, as there are no known serious adverse effects such as lymphoproliferative disorder or virus reactivation like TNF or IL-6-targeting therapies. Therefore, IL-1 is expected to become an attractive molecular target to treat a wide range of diseases such as autoinflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, infectious disease, metabolic syndromes, ischemic diseases, and malignant tumors [217, 218] (Table 2).",
