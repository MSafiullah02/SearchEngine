Health Technical Memorandum 2025 (HTM) and Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) along with various national expert committee consensus statements, regional and hospital-based protocols available in a public domain were retrieved. Selected publications and textbooks describing HVAC structural aspects were also reviewed, and we described the basic structural details of HVAC system as well as variations in the practised standards of HVAC system in the ICU, worldwide. In summary, there is a need of universal standards for HVAC system with a specific mention on the type of ICU, which should be incorporated into existing infection control practice guidelines.",

Essential functions of HVAC system includes heating (adding heat to raise or maintain temperature), cooling (removing heat to lower or maintain temperature), humidifying (adding water vapour), dehumidifying (removing water vapour) in order to maintain the moisture content of the air, filtering (removing dust particles, biological contaminants like bacteria, viruses and fungi), ventilating (air change rates between outdoor) and air distribution (velocity, flow pattern, direction of movement and distribution patterns) [1, 3] . These functions result in air conditioning, which aid in the prevention of contamination and cross-contamination and environmental protection along with operator protection [1, 2] . Maintaining good indoor air quality (IAQ) is an important non-pharmacological strategy in preventing hospital-acquired infections [4] .",

Once bacteria, moulds or allergens enter a building, air handling systems (HVAC) control their spread, aid in their removal from the system in both droplet-borne (pertussis, influenza, coronavirus, Staphylococcus aureus) and airborne diseases (tuberculosis, Aspergillus, norovirus, varicella zoster virus) [16, [29] [30] [31] . This is achieved either by 'diluting' the pathogen (dilution ventilation) or by removing the pathogen (exhaust ventilation) [3, 16, 30, 32, 33 ]. An improperly maintained HVAC system can be a continuing source of contamination, an example of which is the growth of moulds and other fungi in damp and wet surfaces such as cooling coils, humidifiers, condensate pans and filters [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Poorly designed and maintained HVAC systems in the ICU can lead to 'sick building syndrome' (SBS), characterized by suffocation which can lead to decreased staff performance in addition to various hospital-acquired infections and occupational hazards [34] .",

Filters are rated based on their Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) rating. This ranges from 1 to 20 with higher values suggesting better filter efficiency. MERV 10 will be able to filter 1-3 \u03bcm size, whereas MERV > 13 will be able to filter particles of 0.3 to 1 \u03bcm. Medical facilities usually require MERV 14 to 16. Those filters with MERV \u2265 17 are called high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters [3] . HEPA filters with MERV 17 rating have an efficiency of 99.97% against 0.3 \u03bcm size particles. For clean rooms like body implants manufacturing site, MERV should be 20 (filtration efficiency of 99.999%). Usually, in an AHU, there will be a pre-filter with low to medium efficiency acting as 'roughing filter' removing large particulate matter and many microbes (MERV \u2264 4). They are called 'general filters' graded from G1 to G4 [10] . They have efficiency up to 70% down to 10 \u03bcm sized particle. Their role is very good in arrestance, ability to arrest larger particles like dirt, lint, hair and dust. Following filtration by pre-filter, air subsequently has to pass through an additional filter bank (second bank filter) with 99% efficiency for particles up to 5 \u03bcm, with pressure drop not exceeding 20 mm water gauge (WG). These are called as 'fine filters' graded from F5 to F9 [10] . Following this, air is passed through HEPA with 99.97% efficiency removing particles of 0.3 \u03bcm diameters and delivered to each zone of the building (Fig. 1a [3] . During outbreaks, the concentration of airborne Aspergillus conidia in patient care areas can be up to 100 conidia/m 3 (CFU/m 3 ), whereas in rooms with HEPA, filtration the counts below 0.1 CFU/m 3 were reported [35] . Guidelines for infection control in health care facilities show that the filtration system with HEPA filters is adequate for most patient care areas [36] . These filters are at least efficient for removing particles sized more than 0.3 \u03bcm in diameter [3] .",

The effectiveness of 100% fresh air system combined with UVGI is almost similar to the use of re-circulated air coupled with the use of HEPA filtration, provided an adequate number of ACH were maintained [31] . The energy cost of the latter is lesser when compared to the former [31] . Air velocity and distribution also play an important role in air distribution system.

When the path is interrupted by air streams, the pathogen is likely to migrate to other places of the room. This creates the importance of air distribution pattern which is suggested only by ASHRAE in burns ICU. The placement of inlets (diffusers) which deliver air also forms an important aspect of air distribution pattern, and they should not be placed over the heads of occupants (patients or staff). Careful thought must be given to the size and location of the air inlets so that turbulence is avoided in its path [44] . Despite well-known effects of HVAC in infection control, there are significant differences which are highlighted among these standards. It is concerning that even in the guidelines on prevention of hospitalacquired pneumonia, not much importance has been given to developing HVAC design and maintenance standards as an infection prevention strategy [45, 46] .",

Modern systems have the ability to control IAQ by assessing temperature, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentration, humidity and airflow rates and adjusting according to the work environment. An 'intelligent HVAC' can sense the interaction between users and space and modify the working environment according to the needs, with minimal use of thermal or electrical energy thereby contributing to energy conservation aiming at creating a 'green hospital' [54, 55] . In view of the varied requirement of ventilation needs for various places and occupants, further advancement in this field is a move towards 'personalized ventilation (PV)', where the supplying air terminal devices (ATD) are located close to the breathing zone of the occupants who can regulate the temperature and humidity and thereby their own inhaled air quality [56] .",
