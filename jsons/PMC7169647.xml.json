Apart from CoVs, Torovirinae is the other subfamily of Coronaviridae. CoVs are further subdivided into 4 genera: \u03b1-CoV, \u03b2-CoV, \u03b3-CoV, and \u03b4-CoV on the basis of their phylogenetic clustering. SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 belongs to the \u03b2 group [15, 16]. CoVs are named after their \u201ccrown-like\u201d appearance observed under electron microscopy with club-shaped peplomers projecting from their surface. CoVs are non-segmented positive-sense RNA viruses containing approximately 30 kilobase (kb) genomes, characterized by the organization of 5\u2032-leader-UTR-replicase-S (Spike)-E (Envelope)-M (Membrane)-N (Nucleocapsid)-3\u2032UTR-poly (A) tail with accessory genes interspersed within the structural genes at the 3\u2032 end of the genome [17]. To penetrate host cells, CoVs can use various cell surface molecules as their receptors, preferentially ectoenzymes, e.g., aminopeptidase N (APN), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) [18].",

Components of the replication-transcription complex are firstly translated [23]. In addition, abundant sub-genomic negative-sense RNAs are produced. Then, the viral structural proteins (S, E, and M) are translated, inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and transported to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment. After accumulation of adequate viral genomic RNA and structural proteins, the N protein and genomic RNA assemble in cytoplasm to form the helical nucleocapsid. Subsequently, the S, E, and M proteins delivered to the budding compartment interact with nucleocapsid to constitute the assembled virus. Finally, the virus is released from the Golgi and exocytosed to the extracellular compartment from the host cells by fusing with virion-containing vesicles [24] (Fig. 1).",

Iron is also essential for viral replication. In the context of HIV-1 infection, iron is involved in several key steps of virus replication. In the reverse transcription of viral RNA into DNA, the required dNTPs are generated by RNRs which are an iron-dependent proteins [26]. NF-\u03baB can be activated by iron via generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) [27]. I\u043aB kinase activation depends on iron efflux [28\u201330], which increases NF-\u043aB levels and contributes to the activation of HIV-1 promoter [31]. Nuclear export of new transcribed viral RNA is also iron-dependent [32]. Finally, an iron-binding ATPase, ATP binding cassette subfamily E member 1 (ABCE1), is involved in the assembly of the Gag capsid proteins into mature HIV-1 virions [33].",

Iron is absorbed by duodenal enterocytes and released into plasma by an iron exporter protein, ferroportin, which is expressed on the basolateral side of the duodenal enterocytes. Ferroportin is also expressed in macrophages and essentially governs iron release and recycling [38]. The systemic iron homeostasis is fundamentally orchestrated by the hepcidin-ferroportin axis. Hepcidin is mainly expressed and secreted by hepatocytes, and can bind to its sole receptor, ferroportin. After binding to hepcidin, ferroportin is internalized and degraded, leading to the inhibition of iron absorption from the duodenum and reduction of iron release from macrophages [39]. The cellular iron uptake is primarily mediated by the interaction between iron-bound transferrin and transferrin receptor1 (TfR1) [40].",

            "text": "Hepcidin expression could be regulated by systemic iron availability (iron deficiency and iron overload), inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2), bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP2 and BMP6), and erythropoietic signals (ERFE, GDF15, and TWSG1) [40]. SARS patients exhibited increased amounts of proinflammatory cytokines in serum including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b3 coupled to the pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung damage [41]. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 also leads to the increased levels of IL1-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, IP10 (interferon-inducible protein 10), and MCP1 (monocyte chemotactic protein 1), likely inducing T-helper-1 cell response [3]. Thus, induction of these cytokines could supposedly promote hepcidin production and lead to iron sequestration in macrophages, which warrants future investigations. Of note, macrophages are presumed to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 [42]. Thus, increased iron storage will most likely favor viral replication inside macrophages. Furthermore, viruses can manipulate other iron-related proteins to facilitate their replication and propagation. In the context of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection, homeostatic iron regulator protein (HFE), a competitor of TfR1 to bind to transferrin, is degraded after binding by US2 protein, leading to cellular iron overload [43]. In macrophages infected by HIV-1, the interaction of Nef protein and HFE also induces cellular iron overload [44]. Plus, TfR1 is also used as the receptor during the entry of several types of viruses [45, 46].",

            "text": "Iron dependence of viral replication and modulation of host iron metabolism by viruses, as discussed above, signifies the importance of cellular iron homeostasis in viral life cycle and incites the development of iron chelation strategy in treating viral infections. Currently, there are two promising strategies to deplete iron. The first strategy is to deplete iron directly by iron chelators which have strong and selective affinity with iron ions [47, 48]. Some of these iron chelators have been approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration for clinical use, such as deferoxamine (DFO, Desferal\u00ae), deferiprone (DFP, Ferriprox\u00ae), and deferasirox (ICL670, Exjade\u00ae) [49]. Iron chelators can bind free iron or remove iron from iron-containing proteins [48]. Treatment with higher doses of DFP has been shown to prolong the survival of AIDS patients after HIV-1 infection [50]. Increasing evidence suggests that iron chelators can target HIV-1 replication. The enzymatic activity of ribonucleotide reductase 2 involved in reverse transcription, which contains non-heme iron, is inhibited by DFO and 311 [51]. Bp4aT, Bp4eT, Phenyl-1-pyridin-2yl-ethanone (PPY)-based iron chelators (PPYeT and PPYaT) inhibit HIV-1 transcription by decreasing CDK2 and CDK9 activities, and by upregulating I\u03baB\u03b1 expression and downregulating nuclear NF-\u03baB [12, 13]. Topical fungicide ciclopirox and the iron chelator DFP inhibit HIV-1 gene expression at the level of transcription initiation by interfering with the hypusine modification of eIF5\u03b1 [32]. Patients treated with DFP unveiled strong HIV-1 RNA decline while on-drug and also for up to 8 weeks off-drug without viral rebound [52]. DFO and DFP inhibited HIV-1 replication in human PBMCs and macrophages but the inhibition is attributed to a decrease in cell proliferation [53]. Similar to DFO and DFP, oral uptake of bidentate iron chelators, CP502 and CP511 inhibit HIV-1 replication by reducing cellular proliferation [54]. Host cell enlargement induced by viruses, e.g., HCMV, could be inhibited by iron chelators through inhibiting mitochondrial activity and macromolecular synthesis [55]. Nonetheless, these iron chelators may be scrutinized for their antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.",

Nonetheless, the possible applications of agonists to target the hepcidin-ferroportin axis or other iron-related genes in order to achieve antiviral effects still need further exploration, and more efforts are thus urgently needed.",

            "text": "Apart from iron, cumulative evidence has manifested that other metals (e.g., calcium, zinc, and magnesium) are also involved in the replication process of CoVs. The entry of CoVs into host cells is mediated by the viral S protein. Under this context, previous studies have demonstrated that calcium is indispensable for SARS-CoV S-mediated fusion [57]. The replication of SARS-CoV genome requires RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to synthesize descendant RNAs from a RNA template, which sternly relies on magnesium (Mn2+) for its activity [58]. In the meantime, SARS-CoV RNA dimers, a prerequisite for ribosomal frameshifting, are assembled through \u201ckissing\u201d loop-loop interactions. Nonetheless, to reach more stable formation of loop-loop kissing complex, the presence of Mn2+ appears to be necessary [59]. Regarding zinc (Zn2+), the binding of Zn2+ ions to the metal-binding domain (MBD) of SARS-CoV helicase is essential for its enzymatic activity [60]. Additionally, the maturation of CoVs requires papain-like protease (PLpro), which could cleave the nonstructural polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab). However, devoid of Zn2+ ions, the stability of the tertiary structure of SARS-CoV PLpro is compromised with diminished activity [61]. Moreover, MERS-CoV PLpro bears a folded structure and potent proteolytic and deubiquitinating activities upon binding with endogenous metal ions [62]. To this end, the above findings collectively suggest that disturbing the viral metal dependence would presumably exhibit antiviral effects.",

For instance, bismuth compounds have been used clinically as medicines to treat various gastrointestinal diseases. Bismuth (Bi3+) ions strikingly compete with Zn2+ ions for the MBD of helicase, leading to compromised enzyme activities and severe deficiencies in viral replication [63]. As metal chelators, aryl diketoacids (ADK) have been verified to inhibit enzymes, such as HIV-1 integrase and HCV RdRp, in that ADKs function to repress the NTPase/helicase activities of SARS-CoV by mimicking Bi3+ ions [64]. Mercury (Hg2+) ions and Zn2+ ions act to inhibit viral proteases, such as 3C-like protease (3CLpro) of norovirus, PLpro of SARS-CoV, HCMV protease, and HCV NS3 protease [62]. Of note, the 3CLpro plays a vital role in viral protein maturation for SARS-CoV. In fact, their metal-conjugated compounds, including phenylmercuric acetate (PMA), toluene-3,4-dithiolato zinc (TDT), and Nethyl-N-phenyldithiocarbamic acid zinc (EPDTC), elicit great inhibition on SARS-CoV 3CLpro. As a pharmaceutical excipient, PMA is widely used in parenteral and topical pharmaceutical formulations. Further, zinc acetate is added as a supplement to the drug in treating Wilson\u2019s disease [65]. Zn2+ ions could directly impair viral RNA synthesis, due to its strong suppression on both the replication and transcription complexes [66]. As summarized above, an array of other metals besides iron incredibly account for the functions and activities of enzymes involved in CoVs\u2019 replication, which underpins rational metal-oriented therapeutic development against CoVs.",

While the emerging viral infection by SARS-CoV-2 is much less understood compared with HIV-1 or SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, based on the previous studies, it is plausible that deprivation of iron supply to the virus could serve as a beneficial adjuvant in treating the SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the prerequisite of adequate understandings on one\u2019s iron status, such as serum iron and ferritin levels, and globin content.

Transcription and translation of viral genes yield viral genomic RNA and structure proteins (e.g., S, E, M, and N). After further processing and assembly in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi, new CoVs are constructed. Finally, the new formed virions are exocytosed by fusing with virus-containing vesicles.
