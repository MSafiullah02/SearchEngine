PDZ domains are small modular protein entities consisting of 80\u2013110 residues. Despite a very low sequence similarity, where few regions are conserved (Figure 1 and Figure S1, Supporting Information), PDZ domains share a compact globular fold generally comprising five to six antiparallel \u03b2\u2010strands and two \u03b1\u2010helices in a \u03b2A\u2010\u03b2B\u2010\u03b2C\u2010\u03b1A\u2010\u03b2D\u2010\u03b2E\u2010\u03b1B\u2010\u03b2F arrangement (Figure 2a). However, a few PDZ domains such as those of Golgi reassembly stacking protein 1 (GORASP1) and GORASP2 deviate from this common secondary structural arrangement by comprising a \u03b2C\u2010\u03b1A\u2010\u03b2D\u2010\u03b2E\u2010\u03b1B\u2010\u03b2F\u2010\u03b2A\u2010\u03b2B configuration while maintaining the overall globular fold of PDZ domains (Figure 2b).23 The N\u2010 and C\u2010terminal regions of PDZ domains are often in close proximity, which may have facilitated an evolutionary insertion of PDZ domains into larger proteins.24 These structural characteristics were first recognized in 1996 by the structural determination of the third PDZ domain of disks large homolog 1 (DLG1), also known as synapse\u2010associated protein 97 (SAP\u201097)25 and has since been supported by X\u2010ray crystal and NMR structures for more than 150 different human PDZ domains, representing approximately 100 different proteins.26\n",

            "text": "PDZ domains were initially recognized by their ability to bind consensus motifs in the C\u2010terminal extremity of their protein interaction partners. The affinity toward such carboxy\u2010terminal peptide sequences has been predicted to be dictated primarily by the very C\u2010terminal amino acid (referred to as P0) and the residue at position \u22122 (P\u22122) of the peptide ligand (Figure 2d). This led to the classification of PDZ domains into three main classes:24, 27 Class I PDZ domains recognize C\u2010terminal peptides with T/S\u2010X\u2010\u03a8 (with T and S being Thr and Ser, respectively, X being any amino acid, and \u03a8 being a hydrophobic residue) motifs, whereas class II and class III PDZ domains preferentially bind \u03a8\u2010X\u2010\u03a8 motifs and D/E\u2010X\u2010\u03a8 motifs (with D being Asp and E being Glu), respectively. In this binding mode, known as the canonical binding mode, the peptide carboxylate arranges as an antiparallel \u03b2\u2010strand in a hydrophobic cleft between \u03b2B and \u03b1A of the PDZ domain, where the C\u2010terminal carboxylate binds to a loop between \u03b2A and \u03b2B through a network of hydrogen bonds (Figure 2a,d). Subtle backbone amide\u2010to\u2010ester substitutions, in either the PDZ domain or ligand, can disrupt the hydrogen bonding network and lead to a substantial reduction in binding affinity.28, 29 The carboxylate binding site has generally been identified as a highly conserved Gly\u2010Leu\u2010Gly\u2010Phe motif, also known as the GLGF loop. However, an alignment of primary sequence and secondary structural features of PDZ domains demonstrate greater variability in this region and suggest a more generalized \u03a8\u2010Gly\u2010\u03a8 carboxylate binding motif, where only the second Gly is conserved among most human PDZ domains (Figure 1 and Figure S1, Supporting Information). This Gly residue adopts a left\u2010handed \u03b1\u2010helical conformation creating the loop required for coordinating to the carboxylate of the peptide ligand.30 The hydrophobic cavity created by the \u03a8\u2010Gly\u2010\u03a8 loop varies in size among the human PDZ domains, allowing various hydrophobic side chains in P0 and thereby contributing to the selectivity.27 In class I PDZ domains, the Thr or Ser in P\u22122 of the ligand forms a hydrogen bond with the imidazole side chain of a highly conserved His residue in the N\u2010terminus of \u03b1B (Figure 2a). Other PDZ domains have a conserved Tyr in the corresponding position, which possesses greater electrophilicity than His, and may explain the preference for acidic amino acids in P\u22122 of some class III PDZ domains.31\n",

            "text": "The early simplistic classification of PDZ domains into three classes is still debated; later studies have revealed that PDZ domains are generally highly promiscuous PPI modules,32 and that the mechanism of PDZ domain binding is more complex than initially believed.33, 34 In a number of PDZ domain structures, the peptide ligands bind perpendicular to the PDZ domain in a noncanonical fashion, where only P0 interacts with the PDZ domain.35, 36, 37 Several other examples are known where, in addition to P0 and P\u22122, upstream residues as far as P\u22127 and P\u221214 influence the binding of C\u2010terminal peptide ligands to PDZ domains.27, 38, 39 This includes the synapse\u2010associated protein 90/postsynaptic density\u201095\u2010associated protein (SAPAP), where an N\u2010terminal extension (P\u22126 to P\u221214) is required for the high\u2010affinity interaction with the PDZ domain of synaptic scaffolding protein Shank3. In this case, SAPAP docks into a second hydrophobic pocket formed by an N\u2010terminal extension and the \u03b2B\u2010\u03b2C loop of the Shank3 PDZ domain.40 In yet further distinctive binding mode variations of the canonical interaction, P0 is buried deeper in the binding groove of the PDZ domain, occupying what corresponds to the P1 position (Figure 2e).41 In an additional case, a Gly at P\u22122 induces conformational flexibility within the ligand backbone, whereby the P\u22123 amino acids shifts to occupy the P\u22122 position.42 In another example, a Cys in P0 enables the ligand to bind in two distinct positions, canonical and upward shifted, inserting the P\u22122 amino acid into the conventional hydrophobic binding pocket, and allowing P\u22124 to make a salt bridge to a Lys positioned at the N\u2010terminal of \u03b1B, which stabilizes the binding.38 Some PDZ domains can also bind phosphopeptides,43 which has been suggested to be involved in phosphoregulation of PDZ domain interactions, thus adding to the plasticity of PDZ domain\u2010mediated interactions.44, 45\n",

Here, the entire \u03b2\u2010hairpin peptide (Figure 2f), comprising two \u03b2\u2010strands connected by a sharp \u03b2\u2010turn, is required for binding, thereby occupying more than twice the surface area of peptides binding to PDZ domains in the canonical carboxylate\u2010dependent fashion. The carboxylate binding loop of the PDZ domain plays an essential role by coordinating to the backbone carbonyl of a Phe at P0. This Phe has an analogous role to the hydrophobic P0 residue of canonical C\u2010terminal peptide ligands by occupying the hydrophobic pocket.49 In the case of phospholipids, PDZ domains generally lack well\u2010defined binding pockets and PDZ\u2010phospholipid interactions have been mapped to different structural regions in distinct cases, as reviewed in detail previously.44, 53 Generally, the negatively charged phospholipid head group is stabilized by positively charged clusters in the phospholipid binding site. Both for syntenin and protein interacting with C Kinase 1 (PICK1), the PDZ\u2010phospholipid interactions have been shown to be crucial for clustering membrane receptors to the cell membrane and,54, 55, 56 for PICK1, in a redox\u2010dependent manner.56\n",

In the homotypical PDZ1\u20102 tandem of PSD\u201095, these two domains are restricted by a short linker, positioning the two domains in an antiparallel fashion. In other proteins, such as Whirlin, a longer and more flexible linker allows for greater flexibility of the tandem PDZ domain.67 In general, the homotypical PDZ tandem domains can facilitate either binding of multiple copies of single proteins or multiple subunits of protein complexes (Figure S2, Supporting Information), such as the PSD\u201095 GluN2B interaction. Alternatively, the PDZ tandem domain can bind to different participants in a protein complex, such as one GluN2B subunit and one nNOS binding to one PDZ12 tandem of PSD\u201095.",

However, under excitotoxic conditions, massive calcium influx through the NMDAR activates nNOS, which leads to the generation of toxic levels of NO.115, 116, 117\n",

Screening of a 150 000 compound library identified IC87201 (2\u2010((1H\u2010benzo[d][1,2,3]triazol\u20105\u2010ylamino)methyl)\u20104,6\u2010dichlorophenol) as an inhibitor of the PSD\u201095/nNOS interaction with an IC50 of 31 \u00b5m.122 IC87201 was examined in vivo for nociceptive effects in mice after intrathecal (i.t.) administration and showed a significant pain reducing effect at 100 pmol in the presence of NMDA, with no effect in the absence of NMDA. Furthermore, IC87201 was tested in the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain, and displayed an alleviating effect on pain perception, and similar effects were seen when administering a variant of nNOS fused to the cell penetrating peptide (CPP) Tat.122 A structure\u2013activity relationship (SAR) study of IC87201 leads to the discovery of ZL006,123 which was shown to be an inhibitor of the nNOS/PSD\u201095 interaction following glutamate/glycine treatment with an IC50 value of 82 nm in cultured cortical neurons. ZL006 was shown to ameliorate cerebral ischemic brain damage in mice when administered after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO).123 Later studies have shown promising effects of ZL006 in results from forced swimming tests124 and regenerative repair following transient MACO (tMCAO)\u2010induced stroke,113 while recent studies have raised doubts about the rapid\u2010onset antidepressant effects of ZL006 in mice.125\n",

The structures of the first two PDZ domains of PSD\u201095 showed that the binding pockets of PDZ1 and PDZ2 are very similar.70 This was exploited to develop a PDZ1\u20102 tandem\u2010specific dimeric PSD\u201095 ligand, bridging two Kv1.4\u2010derived decamer peptides (CSGSAWETDV) through a disulfide bond (Figure 6), which improved the affinity \u224820\u2010fold relative to the monomeric ligand.70 This approach was further developed, first showing that a pentameric GluN2B\u2010derived peptide, IETAV, displayed WT affinity toward PSD\u201095,129 and subsequently showing that crosslinking the two peptides with a PEG linker, with optimized length (UCCB01\u2010125, Figure 6) resulted in an affinity of 10 nm, a 145\u2010fold increase relative to the monomeric peptide.139 Notably, it was shown that crosslinking with the PEG linker substantially prolonged the plasma stability, while later studies showed that UCCB01\u2010125 could not permeate the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB). Thus, a modified PEG linker was developed,121 which included a central amine handle where a Tat peptide, YGRKKRRQRRR, was attached. This addition rendered UCCB01\u2010144 (or AVLX\u2010144) BBB permeable, and increased affinity further to 4.6 nm, a 1000\u2010fold affinity increase compared to the corresponding monomeric peptide and NA\u20101.121 UCCB01\u2010144 was demonstrated to protect against ischemic brain damage in a mouse pMCAO model at a dose of 3 nmol g\u22121 given i.v. and improved neuromuscular function. Surprisingly, NA\u20101 did not show significant effect, which later was shown to be a dose dependent, and NA\u20101 showed effect in mice at 10 nmol g\u22121.140 Subsequent studies have explored UCCB01\u2010125 and UCCB01\u2010144 further: First, a series of trimeric ligands were developed targeting all three PDZ domains of PSD\u201095.141 Second, to increase the plasma stability of the dimeric ligands, the Tat sequence was replaced with various fatty acids, which substantially increased the half\u2010life in rats relative to UCCB01\u2010144.142\n",

Furthermore, the SHANK genes seem to be further regulated by epigenetic factors.181 The Shank proteins are all expressed in the excitatory synaptic regions, where they are crucial for proper synaptic transmission and function.182 The canonical isoform of Shank3 (Uniprot: Mouse: Q4ACU6\u20101, Human: Q9BYB0\u20101), contains six ankyrin repeats, an SRC homology 3 (SH3) domain, a PDZ domain, a proline rich region (PRO), and a sterile alpha motif (SAM) (Figure 8a). Although 30 different mutants have been found in the Shank3 gene, and at least three have been shown to associate to psychiatric diseases, none are positioned within the PDZ domain of Shank3.

The Wnt signaling is commonly divided into the \u03b2\u2010catenin\u2010dependent (canonical) and independent (noncanonical) pathway. In the canonical signaling pathway, Wnt ligands, which are secreted glycoproteins, bind to the N\u2010terminal extracellular cysteine\u2010rich domain of the G protein\u2010coupled receptor (GPCR) family Frizzled (Fz).205 The signal is propagated through Dvl by a direct interaction between the internal recognition motif (KTXXXW) located in the C\u2010terminal region of Fz and the Dvl PDZ domain,202 followed by polymerization of Dvl, mediated by the DIX domain. The Dvl polymers function as structural scaffold platforms to further facilitate the dissemination of the Wnt signal, which leads to the activation of \u03b2\u2010catenin and T\u2010cell factor (TCF)\u2010dependent transcription of developmental genes and genes associated with tumorigenesis.206, 207, 208 The noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway refers to a group of signaling pathways, which do not lead to \u03b2\u2010catenin\u2010dependent transcription. The two best\u2010studied noncanonical signaling pathways, the planar cell polarity (PCP) and the Wnt\u2010calcium pathways, are both initiated by Wnt binding to Fz followed by intracellular interaction with Dvl. However, the downstream interaction partners of Dvl and effectors differ between the two signaling pathways. Ultimately, the PCP pathway leads to a rearrangement of the cytoskeleton and thus polarization of the cell and the Wnt\u2010calcium pathway regulates the intracellular release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).209 Given the pleiotropic nature of the Wnt signaling cascades, it is not surprising that regulation of this pathway is associated with a variety of disease states, including fibrosis, neurodegeneration, and cancer (Table S3, Supporting Information).203 Specifically, aberrant Wnt signaling has been reported in tumors from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatoblastoma, colorectal cancer, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), multiple myeloma, and gastric cancer.210 The impact of Wnt signaling on cancerogenesis of colorectal cancer is particularly well described and tightly connected to the loss of the protein adenomatous polyposis coli (APC),211, 212 a downstream effector of Dvl and regulator of tumor suppressor genes. Functional loss of APC results in constitutive activation of Wnt signaling and thus promoting transcription of genes encoding oncoproteins.213\n",

The first Dvl inhibitor targeting the PDZ domain, NSC668036, was identified through receptor\u2010based virtual screening of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) small\u2010molecule library214 (Figure 9g). Later, the same group developed a more potent small\u2010molecule inhibitor, J01\u2010017a, (Kd = 1.5 \u00b5m) by combining 3D quantitative structure\u2013activity relationship (3D\u2010QSAR) analysis and structural studies.215 Another Dvl\u2010PDZ inhibitor, FJ9, was designed based on an indole\u20102\u2010carbinol scaffold, and shown to block the interaction between the C\u2010terminal of Fz and Dvl (Kd = 29 \u00b5m) and to suppress tumor growth in vivo.216 Next, a series of indole\u20102\u2010amide\u2010based Dvl inhibitors was described, with the aim to mimic the side chain interaction of fourth amino acids of native PDZ ligands. The optimized inhibitor, 6e, showed an IC50 value of 23 \u00b5m.217 The small\u2010molecule inhibitor, 3289\u20108625, was developed by a combination of in silico screening and structural analysis,218 binds to Dvl with a Kd of 11 \u00b5m, has cell permeable properties, and inhibits Wnt signaling pathways.217 Nonsteroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are best known for its pain\u2010relieving properties by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, but evidence suggests that NSAIDs also affect the Wnt signaling pathway. One such example is sulindac (Clinoril, Figure 9e,f), which suppresses the canonical Wnt pathway in breast cancer, lung cancer, and colon cancer cell lines by binding to the PDZ domain of Dvl with an affinity of Kd = 11 \u00b5m.219 In another study, efforts in identifying small\u2010molecule inhibitors targeting the Dvl PDZ domain were based on screening commercially available compound libraries, which identified 20 hits, with several compounds containing an indole ring.220 KY\u201002052 and KY\u201002061 were identified as the lead compounds. Although KY\u201002052 significantly increased nuclear \u03b2\u2010catenin, the compound showed severe cytotoxicity in cell viability assays and was not pursued further. Thus, KY\u201002061 (IC50 = 24 \u00b5m) was shown to be the most active compound with less cytotoxic effects.220 However, KY\u201002327 was later shown to have poor metabolic stability. To further develop KY\u201002327, 55 KY\u201002061 derivatives were constructed and KY\u201002327, containing a 2\u2010aminoethyl piperidyl moiety at the carboxylic group, showed improved affinity (IC50 = 3.1 \u00b5m), stability, is orally active, and dose\u2010dependently regulated the Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin pathway. NMR experiments revealed that the binding site for KY\u201002327 is located in the canonical PDZ binding pocket, including three residues in the \u03b12\u2010helix (V318, R322, and V325).220 A more recent effort in developing small molecules targeting the PDZ domain of Dvl221, 222 was initiated by generating a pharmacophore model, based on the X\u2010ray crystal structure of Dvl PDZ/Dapper peptide complex and the NMR structure of Dvl PDZ/sulindac (Figure 9e,f).219, 223 The model was used to screen approximately 7 million virtual compounds and 19 initial hits were validated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which showed eight compounds that bind to Dvl PDZ. The four best hits all contained a phenoxyacetic acid group and with BMD4602 showing the highest affinity (Kd = 11 \u00b5m).221 This study was followed by the generation of two new pharmacophore models based on molecular dynamic (MD) simulations of the Idax peptide (RKTGHQICKFRKC)\u2013Dvl PDZ interaction and three known X\u2010ray crystal structures of synthetic peptides binding to Dvl PDZ. A virtual library comprising 8 million compounds was examined and 16 virtual hits were identified and experimentally validated by fluorescence polarization (FP) assays. One compound, BMD4722, was confirmed as a PDZ domain binder (Kd = 22 \u00b5m). The binding mode of BMD4722 was validated by NMR and shown to involve residues Ile267, Ser268, Ile269 (located in the \u03b22\u2010sheet), Val323, and Arg325 (located in the \u03b12\u2010helix).222\n",

            "text": "Several peptide\u2010based inhibitors for Dvl PDZ have been described, including three inhibitors which are based on the sequence of native Dvl PDZ interaction partners, and one inhibitor which is derived from phage display screening (Figure 9g). The native\u2010derived peptide sequences are based on C\u2010terminal regions of TMEM88, Dapper (Dpr), or Idax, and these peptide inhibitors have primarily been developed and used as molecular probes for the Wnt signaling pathway. Generally, most PDZ interactions only require the last three to four amino acids in the C\u2010terminal tail of the ligand. However, the Dvl PDZ has been shown to interact with internal motifs. This is the case for Idax, which interacts with Dvl PDZ via a KTXXXI motif, and is therefore a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway.224 The Idax peptide, Ac\u2010RKTGHQICKFFRKC\u2010NH2, binds to Dvl1 with a Kd of 56 \u00b5m, which is in the range of native PDZ\u2013ligand interactions. The binding mode was verified by NMR studies, which also confirmed the peptide to be located in the groove between \u03b12\u2010helix and \u03b22\u2010sheet.225 In 2002, the C\u2010terminal region of Dpr, a Dvl\u2010dependent regulator of normal vertebrate development via the canonical Wnt\u2010signaling pathway, was shown to interact with Dvl.223 Specifically, the last four amino acids of the C\u2010terminal tail of Dpr, SLKLMTTV, were suggested to be required for the interaction.223 The Dpr/Dvl canonical interaction was confirmed by NMR.223 The interaction between the Dvl PDZ/Dpr derived peptide was later validated and determined the affinity to Kd = 11 \u00b5m\n218 (Figure 9g). The researchers responsible for the development of the small\u2010molecule Dvl inhibitors, FJ9 and J01\u2010017a,215, 216 also designed peptide\u2010based inhibitors. They started out by using a tripeptide template comprising VVV, which has been reported to have a \u03b2\u2010strand\u2010like structure in water. The interaction between PDZ Dvl and VVV was validated by NMR. Next, the amino acid side chain in position P\u22121 was examined for the improvement of the binding, and 18 proteinogenic amino acids at the P\u22121 positions in the VXV scaffold (X: any amino acid except Pro) were virtually introduced. The tripeptide VWV was simulated to have the highest binding energy and further validated by NMR and fluorescent binding experiments. The Kd of VWV to PDZ Dvl1 was determined as 2 \u00b5m, compared to 71 \u00b5m for VVV.219 Later, the transmembrane protein 88 (TMEM88), comprising a VWV motif in the C\u2010terminal, was identified as Dvl binder and shown to attenuate the Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin signaling pathway.226\n",

Ten unique peptides were found and shown to have a preference for ligands comprising a \u03a9\u03d5GWF C\u2010terminal motif (\u03a9: hydrophobic residues, \u03d5: aromatic residues, Figure 9a,b).227 A second attempt used a phage display library comprising internal peptide ligands lacking the free C\u2010termini, and identified 127 peptides that were grouped into three sequence families (N1\u2010N3). Each subfamily contained a conserved Asp, which most likely substitutes for the free carboxylate on the C\u2010termini.42 The affinity and the binding mode of the three peptides (N1: WKDYGWIDGK, N2: SGNEVWIDGP, N3: EIVLWSDIP) binding to the Dvl2 PDZ domain were characterized by X\u2010ray crystallography (Figure 9c,d) and FP. A detailed study of the Dvl2 PDZ revealed a flexible binding cleft, which can accommodate both linear peptide motifs as well as internal ligands. The lead peptide N3, with a Kd of 4.6 \u00b5m, was further validated by conjugating a CPP tag (antennapedia) and a fluorophore to the peptide, to enable intracellular location and visualization in HEK293S cells. Peptide N3 was readily internalized and inhibited canonical Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin signaling in HEK293S in a dose\u2010dependent manner, and was shown to be at least ten times more potent compared to compound FJ9.42\n",

            "text": "Scribble (SCRIB) was first discovered in Drosophila melanogaster as a tumor suppressor gene, as deletion of it caused aberrant proliferation and outgrowth of tissue.228 Human Scribble is a 1630 aa protein comprising an N\u2010terminal leucine\u2010rich repeat (LRR) region followed by four PDZ domains and a flanking C\u2010terminal tail (Figure 10a). The protein is involved in the establishment of cell polarity, cell migration, and tight junctions.228, 229 Dysregulation of Scribble has been shown to promote cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Mammalian Scribble is part of an intracellular protein complex comprising disk large (Dlg1\u20105) and lethal giant larvae (Lgl1/2). This protein complex is located in the basolateral compartments of epithelial cells230, 231, 232, 233 and is required for the establishment of apical\u2010basal cell polarity and growth control.234 Disruption of apical\u2010basal polarity leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation and thus stimulates the epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is a major factor in cancer development.235 In addition, Scribble has been shown to be part of the Hippo pathway, an evolutionarily conserved kinase signaling pathway involved in organ size control and tissue homeostasis.236 Scribble interacts with Fat1, a transmembrane receptor and an upstream regulator of the Hippo pathway, via its PDZ domains. However, this interaction mechanism is not conserved across species. The C\u2010terminal amino acid sequence of Fat1 in human, mouse, and zebrafish constitutes a class I PDZ binding motif (HTEV). This binding motif has been reported as responsible for the interaction between Scribble and Fat1. Drosophila Fat\u2010like protein has also been reported to interact with Scribble. This interaction, however, is not dependent on the C\u2010terminal PDZ binding motif (HTEV), suggesting that Scribble recognizes an internal epitope in Drosophila.237 Scribble is also interacting with the protein \u03b2\u2010PAK\u2010interacting exchange factor (PIX), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42a (Figure 10c\u2013e).238 The interaction between the C\u2010terminus of \u03b2\u2010PIX (PAWDETNL) and the four PDZ domains of Scribble has been studied in detail. The X\u2010ray crystal structures of the \u03b2\u2010PIX peptide binding to PDZ1 and PDZ3 highlight how the binding preference and specificity is achieved (Figure 10d). The PDZ1 interaction is dependent on the side chains of Leu0, Thr\u20102, Glu\u20103, and Trp\u20105, while the primary determinant for the selectivity is Trp\u20105. In PDZ1, the Trp\u20105 forms a hydrophobic interaction by packing against Tyr751, whereas in PDZ3, the Trp\u20105 is rotated and forms a hydrogen bond interaction with Ser1026, while also forming a C\u03b2H:\u03c0 interaction with Pro1028. Sequence alignment of all four Scribble proteins reveal that the selectivity profile of \u03b2\u2010PIX can be attributed to sequence differences rather than structural differences (Figure 10b,c).239 The preference and selectivity for PDZ1 and PDZ3 over PDZ2 and PDZ4 was validated in a cellular context using endogenously expressed \u03b2\u2010PIX. Further insight into the PDZ3\u20104 tandem showed that binding to PDZ3 of the class I ligand was enhanced by a secondary binding pocket forming between the canonical binding pocket in PDZ3 and the back side of the binding pocket of PDZ4 (Figure 10g).240\n",

The affinity was determined to Kd = 21 \u00b5m by NMR and shown to inhibit syntenin binding to EGFRvIII. Treatment with 113B7 in an in vivo glioma model resulted in smaller, less invasive tumors and enhanced survival.250\n",

A subset of the 80 peptides was further screened using a positional scan from P0 to P\u221210, with 20 different amino acids obtaining the C\u2010terminal core peptide (P0\u2013P\u22123). The optimized peptide was then combined with an N\u2010terminal elongation library screening for P\u22124 and P\u22125 position selectivity. The peptide WPTSII resulting from this approach had a modest affinity of 33 \u00b5m. However, through optimizing the peptide for CAL, it lost affinity for the four other tested PDZ domains also interacting with CFTR, resulting in a 150\u2010fold increase in selectivity. Elongating the peptide further to ten residues resulted in the final peptide, iCAL3610, with an affinity of 22.6 \u00b5m, which maintained selectivity for CAL (Figure 13d,h).296 Later, iCAL3610 was shown to be a competitive inhibitor of CFTR binding to CAL, which stabilized the dF508\u2010CFTR variant surface expression and thereby increasing CFTR conductance.297\n",

While iCAL1155 and iCAL1113 primarily perturbed residues in and around the canonical binding pocket, MD was shown to perturb an area adjacent to the binding pocket, which was also confirmed by the X\u2010ray crystal structure (Figure 13h). Here, the Cys side chain is covalently linked to MD, but this linkage was highly dependent on experimental conditions. In the case of iCAL1113 and iCAL1155, both compounds were found to be highly cytotoxic, affecting both cell proliferation and inducing cell apoptosis.93 In another study, using of cysteine\u2010reactive compounds ED (Figure 13h) and EM was found to modulate the binding of HPV16 E6 to the PDZ domain of CAL (Figure 13f\u2013h). Although the ED, EM, and MD most likely have limited therapeutic use, targeting PDZ domains with allosteric inhibitors through reactive Cys residues might have other uses. Comparison of all PDZ domain sequences shows that 162 out of 267 PDZ domains contain one or more Cys in their sequence (Table S1, Supporting Information). An example is the RGS3 (regulator of G protein signaling 3), which contains four Cys residues in its PDZ domains, three positioned in the bottom of the canonical binding pocket, potentially acting as a binding pocket gating mechanism (PDB: 2F5Y). The discovery that CAL is a key influencer of CFTR channel degradation and current modulator in bronchial epithelial cells led to the idea of targeting CAL for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in patients identified with the dF508 variant, increasing the surface lifetime of the channel and restoring channel conductance. However, high affinity and selective inhibitors of CAL are still to be developed.",

The Mint1 N\u2010terminus contains a Munc\u201018\u2010interacting (MI) region followed by a calcium/calmodulin\u2010dependent serine protease interacting (CI) region, while Mint2 contains only the MI region, and Mint3 has neither of the regions. The C\u2010terminal region is conserved among all Mints and comprises a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain, followed by an \u03b1\u2010helical linker (ARM) and two tandem PDZ domains (Figure 15a).306 The relevance of Mints in AD first arose from the co\u2010localization of Mints with the amyloid deposits in postmortem human brain slices.307 However, the effects of Mint2 knockout in mice models of AD has been inconsistent, resulting in either increased or decreased amyloid beta (A\u03b2) levels.308, 309 The molecular mechanism suggested for the role of Mints in AD involve the trafficking of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to the \u03b3\u2010secretase complex promoted by PPIs between both Mint\u2010APP and Mint\u2010presenilin\u20101.310 The PTB domain of Mint proteins interacts with APP C\u2010terminal region peptide motif, YENPTY, while the first PDZ domain of Mint interacts with presenilin\u20101, a constituent of the \u03b3\u2010secretase complex.311, 312, 313, 314, 315 A potential peptide inhibitor of the Mint(PTB)\u2013APP or the Mint(PDZ)\u2013presenilin interactions could reduce the A\u03b2 levels by preventing the recruitment of APP to the \u03b3\u2010secretase complex. Further evidence for this mechanism comes from the reduction in the A\u03b2 levels in mice brain after the genetic replacement of APP gene (APP) with a variant lacking the last 15 amino acids, including the YENPTY sequence.316 In addition to presenilin and APP, some additional Mint interaction partners have been reported, which are also believed to play a role in the amyloidogenic pathway.317\n",

In humans, this protein belongs to a family of proteases comprising HtrA1\u20104, and is composed of a regulatory N\u2010terminal region, followed by a serine\u2010protease domain and a C\u2010terminal PDZ domain (Figure 15b).318 HtrA1 is widely expressed in human tissues, is enriched in the skin, reproductive tissues, and the brain, and is found both in the cytoplasm and in the extracellular space.319 In the cortex of the human brain, it is the most expressed PDZ\u2010containing protein, with almost twice the transcript\u2010count of PSD\u201095.147 Its expression is downregulated in some breast, brain, and liver cancers and it was described as a tumor\u2010suppression factor promoting cell death.320 The relevance of HtrA1 in AD was suggested first in 2005 due to its co\u2010localization with A\u03b2 in human brain slides using immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, the incubation of an HrA1 protease inhibitor dose\u2010dependently reduced the A\u03b2 levels in nontransfected astrocytes.321 Later, it was demonstrated that HtrA1 could degrade aggregated tau protein, another critical feature in AD pathology, and that tau and HrA1 co\u2010localize in human AD brain slices.322 The role of PDZ domains in A\u03b2 and tau was recently investigated. In bacterial HtrA, PDZ domains exert allosteric control of the proteolytic activity.323 This contrasts with human HtrA1, which does not require PDZ domains for fibril cleavage and disaggregation of both tau and A\u03b2 protein.324 However, the length of cleavage products was influenced by the presence of the PDZ domain, suggesting that its precise function in substrate processing is still unclear. The discovery of PDZ ligands that can enhance the proteolytic activity of HtrA1, similarly to the bacterial HtrA, could represent a critical therapeutic intervention for AD.",

Par6 contains one PDZ domain, while Par3 has three (Figure 15c). Par3 and Par6 are expressed in low levels in normal human tissues, but its upregulation was described in renal carcinomas,327 and in gastric cancer.328 Par3 is essential for the delivery of PKC to the apical epithelial surface,329 and the Par6 C\u2010terminus can bind and localize Par3 in the membrane, through the PDZ domain of Par3.330 As the Par complex plays a pivotal role in controlling cell polarity, it is not unexpected that they are also implicated in human carcinogenesis. For example, knockdown of Par3 with RNAi triggers a rapid tumor growth with metastatic colonization in the presence of oncogenes.331 Targeting cell polarity signaling could represent a novel therapeutic intervention to block cell proliferation and prevent epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition (EMT). In particular, Par6 protein is involved in the TGF\u2010\u03b2 pathway in cancer cells.332 The overexpression of the C\u2010terminal S345A mutant of Par6 reduced the EMT in NmuMG cells, and also the number and incidence of metastatic lung tumors.333 The modulation of the TGF\u2010\u03b2\u2010Par6 signaling could represent a selective intervention in cancer treatment.",

Thus, many PDZ domain proteins also play decisive roles in diseases and hence such proteins are relevant targets in drug discovery efforts. However, PDZ domains are also rather promiscuous proteins, often binding to several different partners, typically through their C\u2010terminal region. There could therefore be concerns about achieving selectivity toward a specific PDZ domain. Moreover, it has also been realized that developing drug\u2010like small\u2010molecule inhibitors of PDZ domains is far from straightforward. A key issue is most likely the elongated binding pocket, where a C\u2010terminal peptide is coordinated not only via the terminal carboxylate group, but also through a network of backbone hydrogen bonds, which seems to be difficult to mimic with small molecules. In accordance with this, the most advanced compounds targeting PDZ domain proteins are peptides. While peptides were previously not considered attractive drug candidates, we now see increasing numbers of peptides in clinical development in general, and peptides even have higher success rates than small molecules. As outlined in our review, there are several promising PDZ domain proteins, which can be targeted with therapeutic peptides or potentially small molecules.",

The C\u2010terminal carboxylic acid is stabilized by hydrogen bonding to the Ile125\u2010Gly126\u2010Leu127 loop backbone, while the P0 (Phe) sidechain interacts with His124 through a C\u03b2H\u2013\u03c0 interaction and the P\u22121 backbone carbonyl interacts with Lys124 sidechain amine; the P\u22123 (Glu) backbone amine coordinates an Arg126 sidechain amine. d) Hydrogen bonding network of NH2\u2010TNEFYF\u2010COOH binding to Syntenin PDZ2 shows canonical insertion of the peptide, with hydrogen bonding of P0 and P\u22122 backbone carbonyls/amines to \u03b2B and hydrophobic insertion of P0 (Phe) side chain into the hydrophobic pocket. e) Hydrogen bonding network of the endogenous Syntenin PDZ2 ligand, Syndecan\u20104, shows almost identical hydrogen bonding network as (d), but with the P\u22124 carbonyl partially coordinating (red dashed arc) the side chain amine of Lys214. f) The binding of interleukin5Ra C8 (NH2\u2010ETLEDSVF\u2010COOH) relies on a canonical binding of the C\u2010terminal carboxylic acid, but otherwise binds as a noncanonical ligand, almost perpendicular to the binding pocket. g) Structure (top) and hydrogen bonding network (bottom) of Frizzled7 C6 (NH2\u2010KGETAV\u2010COOH) and lipid derived Inositol 1,3\u2010bisphosphate (IP2) coorporating in the binding to Syntenin PDZ2. The hydrogen bonding network shows normal backbone interactions between the peptide and the domain, and is tightened by side chain interaction between P\u22123 (Glu) and P\u22125 (Lys) and Thr219 and Ser252, respectively. The interaction is stabilized further by interactions between P\u22124 Gly carbonyl coordinating Lys214 and P\u22125 Lys side chain also coordinating a hydroxide H from IP2. The interaction between PDZ2 and IP2 is coordinated by several hydroxide H bonds to the side chain (red arc) and main chain (red arc) of the PDZ domain. h) Structures of inhibitors targeting Syntenin PDZ domains.",

Especially the noncanonical interaction between P\u22124 (Lys) (5HT2A) and Glu385 and P\u22124 (Arg) (HPV18\u2010E6) and Glu385 shows similar electron density suggesting targeted evolution of the HPV18\u2010E6 toward mimicking endogenous PDZ ligands. d) Graphical model of the PDZbody259, 275 where the HPV18\u2010E6 protein binds to the canonical binding pocket in the optimized SAP\u201097\u2010 PDZ2 through its C\u2010terminal residues.
