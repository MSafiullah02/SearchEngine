            "text": "Typhoon Haiyan (2013) devastated portions of south-east Asia and was one of the most intense storms ever documented. The Great East Japan Earthquake (2011) was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded to have hit Japan. The earthquake triggered powerful tsunami waves that reached heights of up to 40.5 m. The earthquake and tsunami caused extensive and severe structural damage to north-eastern Japan and resulted in the meltdown of three nuclear reactors. These events and others such as Hurricane Katrina (2005), Blackout Canada-US (2003), Hurricane Sandy (2012), Alberta (Canada) floods (2013), Heartbleed cyber incursion (2014) and global terrorist actions highlight the vulnerability of social and critical infrastructures to natural hazards, natural hazard triggered technological disasters (NATECHs) and man-made disasters and the crippling effect that such events can have regionally, nationally and globally on social and economic well-being (Masys et al. 2014). This networked risk landscape is one characterised by hyper-risks (Helbing 2013) and hybrid risks (Masys et al. 2014). As noted in Weick and Sutcliffe (Weick and Sutcliffe 2007), \u2018Unexpected events often audit our resilience\u2019 and thereby challenge response and recovery activities. With our hyper-connected world, the impact of unexpected events such as floods, earthquakes, financial crises, and cyber-attacks has revealed the fragility and vulnerabilities that lie within the social/technological/economic/political/ecological interdependent systems (Masys et al. 2014). In particular, events that impact physical and digital critical infrastructure such as damage to electric power, telecommunications, transportation and water-supply systems can ripple across local, regional and global regions. There exists a rich body of knowledge regarding the statistics associated with the occurrence of such outlier events. Taleb (2007) calls these extreme events \u2018Black Swans\u2019 to describe their inherent quality of surprise, sometimes viewed as an \u2018Act of God\u2019. The question arises: can we predict the occurrence of some Black Swans\u2019 (extreme events)? As described by Johnson and Tivnan (2012) \u2018\u2026 understanding, controlling and predicting extreme behavior is an important strategic goal to support resilience planning\u2019. As noted by Sornette (2009).\u2026extreme events should be considered to be rather frequent and to result from the same organization principle(s) as those generating other events: because they belong to the same statistical distribution, this suggests common generating mechanism(s).\n",

Moreover, nascent efforts have been made to apply to complex network theory to obtaining a deeper fundamental understanding of the collective responses of human populations to large-scale emergencies such as bombings, plane crashes, earthquakes, and power outages (blackouts) (Bagrow et al. 2011) with important implications for improvements in emergency detection and response. Finally, very recent efforts on the application of control theory to complex networks (Liu et al. 2011) has been initiated, and this seminal effort is expected to have a potential long-term impact for the improvement of the robustness of technological and infrastructure networks against failures and attacks.",

The dependencies of the various components of a network on each other only become clear when failures (catastrophes) occur in the network such as the rapid spreading of a computer virus over the Internet, the collapse of a global financial system, or the large-scale breakdown of an electrical power grid. Yet, researchers (Barabasi 2003; Caldarelli 2007; Newman et al. 2006) are discovering general concepts and properties that appear to be intrinsic to the various diverse complex networks, leading to the intriguing concept that there may be a few fundamental organizing principles that determine the topological characteristics and ultimately the behavior of complex networks. In other words, there may be a set of basic universal rules (generic organising principles) that would allow one to predict the emergent behavior in a complex network (despite the seemingly intractability of this enormous task) which according to Barabasi (2005) would allow one \u2018\u2026 to understand the key to nature\u2019s code for multitasking\u2014the one that orchestrates the actions of uncountable components into a magic dance of order and ultimate elegance\u2019.",

Such extreme events cannot be inferred from the properties of their parts; hence local events can have far-reaching consequences that are often difficult to anticipate. The question is posed by Sornette and Ouillon (2012) as to how much the understanding obtained on dragon-kings could lead to operational utility. To this, Janczura and Weron (2012) find such a notion controversial, but nonetheless do not outright discount it, but rather call for more research. Sornette and Ouillon (2012) describe the value of modeling and simulation to explore this regime of complexity, and particularly to support decision making. Their analysis of this domain highlight that failures such as Deepwater Horizon Oil spill (Masys 2012; Wattie and Masys 2014) and subprime crisis, exhibit common patterns including: \u2018lack or decreasing questioning of assumptions over time; insufficient prior analysis; failure to anticipate side effects; incorrect interpretation of the system\u2019s reaction (no immediate obvious negative effect wrongly interpreted as \u201call is well\u201d)\u2019 (Sornette and Ouillon 2012). This resonates with such Natural Disaster Triggered Technological Accidents as the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster (Ray-Bennett et al. 2015), as well as humanitarian crisis (Masys 2013) and violent extremism and radicalization (Masys 2014b). In these analysis and simulations, complex interdependencies and nonlinearity characterize the problem space. Weak signal detection emerges as requirement to facilitate management of such disasters. Suveges and Davison (2012) present an example of a catastrophic event (extreme rainfall) that was apparently impossible from scientific extrapolation or common sense based on the past. In effect, disaster risk reduction through modeling and simulation support planning for and mitigating these types of extreme events.",

            "text": "The rapid advances in complex network science may lead in the early part of the 21st century to the discovery of common operating principles governing the behavior of diverse networks (Barabasi 2005) whose basic understanding would allow not only the prediction of the emergent and complex behavior arising from the interactions of the individual units in a large system, but also the development of a range of specific strategies to defend the network against either a failure or an attack (e.g., stopping the spread of an epidemic on a human or computer network) providing potentially significantly improved resiliency in response to disasters (e.g., global epidemics such as SARS and Ebola, large electrical blackouts, computer viral epidemics such as the Blaster and SoBig worms). For example, some initial seminal work (Liu et al. 2011) has already been conducted to determine the degree of controllability of some real networks. This effort can potentially lead to the development of a tool box that can be applied to the control of arbitrary complex networks, providing a framework to increase the robustness of a network to failures or to an attack (viz., to better resist random or intentional attacks). Finally, new avenues involving novel concepts of multiscale connectivity within networks (Dodds et al. 2002) have been shown to possess the characteristic of ultra-robustness by simultaneously minimizing the likelihood of failure (i.e., avoiding the failure) in the network as well as the effect of the failure if and when this occurs (i.e., minimizing any further loss from the failure if it should occur). Ultra-robustness is a key determinant in the characterization of a complex network with respect to catastrophe recovery whether from a failure or from an attack. Another interesting application of complex network theory is to the prediction of human mobility (Song et al. 2010) and, more specifically, to the deeper understanding of the role and impact of human dynamics and activity patterns in emergency detection and response (Bagrow et al. 2011). Network thinking described by (Masys et al. 2014) figure prominently as a paradigm for examining black swan, dragon king and extreme events.",

            "text": "Though \u201cBlack Swan\u201d events in regional, national and global systems can be viewed as an unpredictable \u201cAct of God\u201d, there is a type of extreme event that appears to be predictable and thus suppressible: the \u201cDragon-King\u201d event. Modeling and simulation of such extreme events can assist in the predictability and the suppression of some low probability extremely high consequence events such as natural hazards (flood, earthquake, wildfire, tsunami, extreme weather), cyber-attacks, financial events, mass crowd evacuation. However, this positive view should be balanced by \u2018the fact that this remains a very delicate and difficult field, if only due to the scarcity of data as well as the extraordinary important implications with respect to hazard assessment, risk control and predictability\u2019 (Sornette and Ouillon 2012). Addressing the Dragon-Kings and Black Swans to support disaster risk reduction requires embracing the inherent uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity that characterizes the problem space. Hence the application of M&S tools and techniques coupled with involvement of experts, stakeholders and the public can provide insights and unique and timely advice to support disaster risk reduction and the resulting risk handling and response strategies. Furthermore, emerging research areas focused on the elucidation of some fundamental organising principles that govern the behavior of diverse networks may confer significantly improved predictive power in a theory of complexity, and this increased understanding of natural or technological networks may facilitate the design of network topologies that are much more tolerant to both failure and attack. Emergency Managers in Governments and owners of critical physical and digital infrastructure may benefit from analyses, advice and exercises that involve predictable and suppressible \u201cDragon-King\u201d type of low probability extremely costly and extremely high consequence events, as well as from recent advances in complex network theory, to ultimately enhance resiliency.",
