Chlamydia trachomatis (C trachomatis) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (N gonorrhoeae) are the most significant bacterial pathogens to be diagnosed in infectious neonatal conjunctivitis, because without treatment they can both lead to serious long\u2010term consequences 8. C trachomatis is considered a major causative agent for neonatal conjunctivitis in many centres 9, 10, 11, but its proportion varies greatly between geographical regions and clinical settings, ranging from 0 to 64% 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.

The specimen collection materials were packed in ready\u2010to\u2010use sets beforehand. Transystem M40 transport cotton\u2010tipped swabs (Copan Diagnostics, Inc, California, USA) were used for bacterial culture and Abbott multi\u2010Collect Specimen Collection Swabs (Abbott Molecular Inc, Illinois, USA) and FLOQSwabs Copan flocked swabs (Copan Diagnostics, Inc, California, USA) for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Conjunctival specimens were collected from the actual site of infection and from both eyes in cases of bilateral conjunctivitis. First, the area around the affected eye was gently cleansed to remove discharge, after which the culture was obtained by swabbing the mucosal area of the lower eyelid. Second, the inner surface of the lower eyelid was swabbed thoroughly two to three times to collect epithelial cells for nucleic acid amplification testing. The swabs were stored and transported at room temperature to the clinical microbiological laboratory at Oulu University Hospital (NordLab, Oulu, Finland) on the same day. Sheep blood agars at a concentration of 5% and chocolate agars were used to culture the bacteria. A multiplex real\u2010time PCR was used to detect respiratory viruses, including adenovirus, bocavirus, enterovirus, influenza viruses A and B, coronaviruses 229E, NL63 and OC43, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3 and 4, respiratory syncytial viruses A and B and rhinovirus. The nucleic acid was isolated for respiratory viruses using the QS DPS Virus/Pathogen Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and a Qiagen Symphony SP instrument (Qiagen, Germantown, USA) and amplified and detected using a Seegene Anyplex RV16 Kit (Seegene Inc, Seoul, Korea) and the CF96TM Real\u2010Time PCR System (Bio\u2010Rad Laboratories Inc, California, USA). PCR was used to detect C trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae, for which nucleic acid was isolated using the Abbott mSample Preparation System DNA Reagent (Abbott Molecular Inc, Illinois, USA) and the Abbott m2000s instrument (Abbott Molecular Inc, Illinois, USA) and amplified and detected using an Abbott Real\u2010Time CT/NG Amplification Reagent Kit (Abbott Molecular Inc, Illinois, USA) and Abbott m2000rt instrument (Abbott Molecular Inc, Illinois, USA).
