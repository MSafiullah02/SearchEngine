To this end, we have developed an evidence based quantitative mechanistic mathematical model. The model explicitly tracks the dynamics of contact and airborne transmission between individuals indoors, and was validated against the observed fundamental attributes of the epidemic, the secondary attack rate (SAR) and serial interval distribution. Using the model we identified the dominant driver of pre-symptomatic transmission, which was found to be contact route, while the contribution of the airborne route is negligible. We provide evidence that a combination of rather easy to implement measures of frequent hand washing, cleaning fomites and avoiding physical contact decreases the risk of infection by an order of magnitude, similarly to wearing masks and gloves.",

These studies also found that the members of the same households has the highest risk of infection among people in different modes of close contact. This conclusion is based on the secondary attack rate (SAR), the percentage of household contacts who were later confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Estimates of the SAR made in China, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States ranges between 10.2 \u2212 16.2% (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . Due to the fact that most of these estimates were made in countries that lead a public health policy of immediate isolation of cases upon symptoms' onset, these estimates represent the effect of pre-symptomatic carrier transmission. In fact, pre-symptomatic transmission was recently referred to as the Achilles' heel of COVID-19 pandemic control, as symptom-based detection of infection is less effective in comparison to the control of the SARS epidemic in 2003 (7) . However, the question of understanding the mechanism that enables seemingly healthy individuals to transmit the virus, was left unsolved. This is the motivation of this study.",

            "text": "Generally, respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, spread via three transmission routes: contact, droplet and aerosol transmission. In contact transmission an infected person gets virus on his hands and transfers this virus either directly, e.g., via a handshake, or indirectly via an intermediate object, to the hands of an infectee, who then places his hand into his facial membranes, thus exposing himself to the contamination on his hands. Transmission of virus through the air can occur via droplets or aerosol. Droplets generated in a cough or a sneeze travel less than 1.5m before they settle on close contacts or environmental surfaces (8) . Aerosols remain suspended in the air and may infect a susceptible individual once they deposit in his upper or lower respiratory tract. The commonly accepted cutoff is 5\u00b5m (9) . However, droplets that are smaller than approximately 100\u00b5m evaporate to their droplet nuclei size before they hit the ground (8) . Following (8) , we assume that the respiratory fluid is a physiological saline solution with anion and cation concentration of about 0.9%w/v. Therefore, the droplet shrinks to about 3 \u221a 0.009 \u2248 0.2 of its original size. Thus, a 100\u00b5m droplet would reduce to a droplet nuclei of 20\u00b5m before reaching the ground. Here we have used a cutoff size of 100\u00b5m between droplets and aerosol. This cutoff size results in an conservative estimation of the contribution of the aerosol transmission route as larger volume of aerosols is considered. The relative importance, if any, of these routes differ for each infectious disease, depending on its specific parameters. In the current study, we model the mechanism of indoor transmission with an individualbased stochastic mechanistic model ( Figure 1 ). The model describes the basic interaction of two individuals, a pre-symptomatic primary (infetor) and a secondary (infectee) individuals.",

We have performed each until the primary developed symptoms in order to address the question of pre-symptomatic transmission, and in accordance with the public health policy that isolates the primary when his symptoms appear. That is, the duration of each realization is the primary's incubation time, that distributes log-normally with a mean of 5 days and standard deviation (SD) of 0.45 days (13) . We assumed an exponential growth law of the viral load with time (10) which reaches its maximal level when the symptoms appear (14) . The probability that the secondary will be infected is inferred from the dose-response curve that was reported for SARS-CoV-1 (15) . We relied on the recent available literature to-date to determine empirically plausible values for the model parameters.

Therefore, we have tried to sort out few combinations of HBMs that will enable practical implementation by the public, while significantly lowering the risk of infection. As the SAR is a proportion, it is appropriate to compare the HBMs in terms of odd ratio (OR), i.e., the odds that the secondary Will be infected when a given combination of HBMs is taken, compared to the reference scenario in which no HBM is applied. Generally, any HBM that results in OR less than 1 decreases the risk of infection (i.e., provide smaller SAR than the reference) (23) . However, in practice the lower the OR, the better HBM combination is at lowering the risk. The values brought here are in terms of OR alongside with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) Washing hands is known to remove the viruses from the hands of both individuals and it is the simplest measure to implement. Our simulations show that washing hands every hour rather than 3 times a day, as in the reference simulation (Table 1) , results in OR of 0.71 (95% CI 0.62-0.8) ( Figure 3A, column H) . This result is consistent with intervention studies that have shown that increased hand washing decreased respiratory illness by 20%, albeit different viruses were studied (24) . This phenomenon seems counter intuitive, as we found that more than 99% of the viruses are transmitted through the hands and it was expected that washing it would remove the contamination. In order understand the reason for the relatively limited effect of hand hygiene, we have examined the dynamics of the virus concentration on the hands of the secondary individual ( Figure 3B ). This concentration exhibits a periodic behaviour, that is governed by touching events in fomites and the face. Spectral analysis reveals that the hand concentration cycle is characterized mainly by frequencies that are with time scale of 50 minutes (see Supplementary text). Therefore, hand washing is expected to dramatically reduce the risk for infection if it occurs at at higher frequency than 50 min. Unfortunately, such frequent 7 All rights reserved.

Our findings can provide an important tool for decision makers while advising the public of the HBMs that are necessary to impede the epidemic. As it seems that the initial wave of pandemic may be closing to its end, many countries are gradually lifting the restrictions on society, such as the re-opening of schools and workplaces.

Between 60% \u2212 80% of the viruses were transmitted via direct contact (route 1), and 20% \u2212 40% by indirect contact via fomites (route 2). Airborne transmission, either by droplets (route 3) or by aerosol (route 4), contributes less than 1% of the total viruses needed to cause an infection. Hence, according to currently available data, the contact route is the dominant mechanism for infection. This transmission is mostly via direct contact although the contribution of fomites mediated contact is also notable.

With this estimation of the parameters, the simulated OR was 0.46 (95% CI 0.4-0.53) (Figure 3A, column M).
