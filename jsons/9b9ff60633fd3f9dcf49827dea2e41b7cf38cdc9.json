Moderate and minor APPs have smaller, but longer lived elevations in circulating concentrations. The major, moderate and minor APPs are different between cats and dogs (Table 1) . In both species, albumin is the most important negative APP; concentrations of albumin will slightly decrease in inflammatory disease, largely due to a shift in hepatic production to positive acute phase proteins in favour of albumin. In the dog, CRP is a major APP with its serum concentration increasing rapidly from < 5 mg/litre to over 100 mg/litre. Recent research at the University of Glasgow and elsewhere has shown that the serum concentration of CRP can increase rapidly in dogs with arthritis, lymphoma, inflammatory bowel disease (Jergens et al., 2003) , in haematological diseases (Tecles et al., 2005) and in many infectious diseases, such that there is a growing body of evidence on the value of these tests in a wide range of conditions Paltrinieri 2007b) .

Although there have been relatively few investigations of the feline acute phase response (Paltrinieri 2007a) , several conditions have been associated with raised levels of these blood proteins (Table 3 ). In addition, the measurement of AGP in feline serum and peritoneal fluid has become a recognised differential test for the identification of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) (Duthie et al. 1997; Giordano et al.. 2004) . Raised levels of AGP have also been reported in tumourbearing cats (Selting et al., 2000) including those with lymphoma (Correa et al., 2001) .

Haptoglobin concentrations are raised in the feline acute phase response though further investigation is required to determine the full diagnostic value of this protein.
