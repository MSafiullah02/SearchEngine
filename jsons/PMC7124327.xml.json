            "text": "The mucosal lining of the stomach normally acts as an effective defensive barrier against acidity, detergents, bacteria, and changes in temperature. That mucosal defense consists of secretions, cells, and blood. Normal gastric secretions represent the first line of defense and include acid, mucus, bicarbonate, and antibacterial substances. The gastric epithelium serves as a barrier to the back-diffusion of acid and is quickly repaired by restitution after injury. The gastric microvasculature is exquisitely responsive to neuronal, hormonal, and inflammatory signals. This blood supply is central to the maintenance of gastric mucosal integrity, the elimination of noxious substances, and gastric epithelial turnover [21], [22], [23]. Macrophages and mast cells are part of the innate immune system that coordinates the gastric inflammatory response when challenged by antigenic stimulation [24]. Finally, like much of the gastrointestinal tract, the gastric mucosa has a large capacity for quickly repairing damaged tissue (ie, restitution of ulcerated mucosal epithelium) [25].",

Chemical injury, ischemia, infection, or antigens can stimulate the release of inflammatory mediators and vasoactive compounds from a variety of cell types (eg, neutrophils, mast cells, platelets, endothelial cells, neurons) (Box 2\n) [28], [29]. Subsequent exfoliation of surface gastric epithelial cells and disruption of the normal mucosal barrier result in back-diffusion of gastric acid, pepsin, and gastric lipase. This inflammatory cascade stimulates further acid secretion and mucosal damage, increases cell membrane permeability, and alters microvascular blood flow. The continued interplay between ischemia and inflammation results in gastric erosion, ulceration, hypoxia, hemorrhage, edema, and necrosis [30].Box 2Inflammatory and vasoactive mediators of gastritis\nCytokinesInterleukin-1\u03b2Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1\nChemokinesLeukotriene B4\n\nEndothelin-1HistamineNitric oxideNeuropeptidesCalcitonin gene-related peptideSubstance P\nOxygen free radicalsPlatelet-activating factor\nPeroxidasesProteinasesTrypsin\nThromboxane\n",

Beyond the radiographic demonstration of gastric distention secondary to overindulgence, these cases are infrequently subjected to extensive diagnostic effort. These patients usually respond to a brief period of gastric inactivity and dietary counseling, although acute pancreatitis is a serious potential sequela. Persistent or repeat offenders should be examined for causes of polyphagia and pica (eg, malnourishment, maldigestion, malabsorption, hyperadrenocorticism, behavioral issues). Outbreaks of food poisoning such as are periodically seen in the human population seem to be either rare or underappreciated events in our canine companions.",

Progression of the disease, repeat radiographic images, contrast studies, or ultrasound examination may provide additional clues in cases of acute gastritis that do not respond to conservative management as anticipated. Uncomplicated cases of acute gastritis should resolve without the use of antiemetics, H2-receptor blockers, or gastrointestinal protectants, and their indiscriminant use may mask symptoms that would otherwise prompt a more in-depth examination of the patient.",

These compounds work by blocking the conversion of arachidonic acid into inflammatory mediators via the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme. Despite the advent of NSAIDs manufactured specifically for veterinary patients (eg, carprofen [Rimadyl], etodolac [Etogesic]), the use of aspirin is still commonplace for dogs with occasional stiffness or chronic osteoarthritis. Ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and indomethacin are other common over-the-counter NSAIDs administered by owners or ingested by opportunistic pets [40], [41]. The depletion of endogenous protective prostaglandins, a decrease in mucus and bicarbonate secretions, a disruption of the epithelial cell layer, a reduction of the surface epithelial cell hydrophobicity, a reduction in mucosal blood flow, an increase in neutrophil adherence, and direct mucosal injury are all components of the deleterious effects of NSAIDs on the gastric mucosa [42], [43]. The antrum and pylorus are the portions of the stomach most susceptible to NSAID-induced lesions. Those lesions can range from surface erythema to erosions to full-thickness ulcerations [44]. The greater the severity of mucosal damage, the greater is the volume of blood entering the gastric lumen and the more likely it is that hematemesis or melena is part of the presenting complaint.",

The theory behind the use of COX-2 inhibitors is illustrated in Fig. 1\n[46]. Although not entirely COX-2 selective, Rimadyl and Etogesic are two NSAIDs approved for use in dogs and designed to reduce ulcer formation relative to aspirin. Endoscopic examination used to compare the gastric mucosa of dogs given aspirin with that of dogs treated with etodolac found that dogs given aspirin invariably had mucosal erosions by day 17 of treatment, whereas none of the dogs given etodolac were found to have any gastric lesions [47]. Regardless of the NSAID administered, none of the dogs in this study were found to have any biochemical abnormalities, vomiting, anorexia, or melena. Other similar studies have confirmed the ubiquity of gastric lesions in dogs receiving aspirin as well as illustrating only the most minor changes in dogs receiving either etodolac or carprofen [48], [49].",

Salmonella spp, Campylobacter jejuni, and Clostridium perfringens are differentials for gastroenteritis, with diarrhea as the most common presenting complaint, and are not discussed further in this article [56]. H pylori is a well-established cause of chronic gastritis and gastric ulceration in people, but whether these spiral-shaped organisms play a role in the pathologic changes of canine gastritis remains to be established [57], [58]. A variety of Helicobacter spp (although not H pylori) [59], [60] can be found in the stomachs of upward of 80% of dogs whether they are vomiting or not [61], [62], [63]. The possible modes of transmission may include fecal-oral, oral-oral, water-borne infection, or through nursing. Urease production, cytology, histopathology, culture, serology, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis can be used to diagnose Helicobacter infection, but in most naturally infected dogs, these species seem to cause no clinically significant change in gastric physiology or function [63], [64]. In addition, one treatment regimen commonly used in cases of human H pylori gastritis (the combination of amoxicillin, metronidazole, and famotidine) proved effective at suppressing canine gastric Helicobacter inhabitants for only a brief period of time [64], [65]. The differences in Helicobacter spp pathogenicity between people and dogs may be related to differences in the infective Helicobacter species themselves or to differences in the host immune response to the infective organisms. In fact, some cases of gastritis in dogs with Helicobacter spp do respond favorably to treatment directed at this organism. Although Helicobacter spp can readily be found in the stomachs of vomiting dogs, it would seem unwise to cite that discovery as reason for ending the search for cause in cases of canine gastritis [66].",

Increased vagal activity, increased gastric acid secretion, histamine release, decreased mucosal barrier function, decreased prostaglandin synthesis, and decreased mucosal blood flow are all potential causative factors [70]. The vagus nerve mediates excitatory input for increased acid secretion by parietal cells and increased bowel motility. In addition to the vagal release of acetylcholine, a wide variety of neuromodulators are known to be active in the gut (ie, serotonin, norepinephrine, gastrin, somatostatin, substance P, vasointestinal active peptide [VIP]), and both VIP and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) have been shown to induce or aggravate gastric ulcers. Although perhaps difficult to quantify, it is easy to appreciate the fact that our veterinary patient population is also subjected to stress, whether it be from illness, surgery, hospitalization, or even more subtle factors. The role of drugs in gastric ulceration has already been eluded to, and in 65% of the complications seen secondary to peptic ulcer disease in people (ie, hemorrhage, perforation), the episode can be linked to recent NSAID ingestion [71]. Altered gastric motility and disorganized myoelectric complex activity have been demonstrated secondary to indomethacin administration in dogs, resulting in gastric ulceration [72]. Although excessive corticosteroids can damage the gastric mucosa, glucocorticoids have a permissive role in the gastric mucosal protection induced by prostaglandins. This aspect of mucosal protection is lost in hypoadrenocorticism, and gastric ulceration is likely an attendant complication in many cases of canine Addison's disease.",

In dogs, the diagnosis is one of exclusion to account for vomiting secondary to bile-induced gastric inflammation. Bile salts acting as detergents dissolve the mucosal lipids that help to form the gastric mucosal barrier, allowing for back-diffusion of hydrogen ions and subsequent gastritis [80], [81].

Gastrin not only stimulates excessive acid secretion but seems to decrease the tone of the pyloric sphincter, allowing for duodenal-gastric reflux of bile [82]. The first case report of the canine version of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome appeared in 1977 in a dog with esophagitis, gastritis, and a duodenal ulcer [83]. Gastrinomas are rare in dogs and usually result in vomiting, weight loss, anorexia, and intermittent diarrhea. The biochemistry panel in these dogs may be consistent with a pyloric outflow obstruction (ie, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, metabolic acidosis). Plasma gastrin levels can be measured using a radioimmunoassay kit, and the laboratory should be contacted for proper sample-handling ins tructions. A significant elevation in gastrin should prompt an effort toward tumor localization (eg, ultrasound, CT, MRI, radiolabeled-somatostatin analogues), although that effort may ultimately depend on intraoperative pancreatic palpation. A more complete discussion of the diagnosis and treatment of canine gastrinomas can be found in an excellent recent review [84].",

Treatment of Helicobacter spp in dogs usually entails a 2- to 3-week course of triple therapy: amoxicillin, metronidazole, and famotidine, with azithromycin, clarithromycin, omeprazole, or ranitidine as an alternative substitution. The treatment of bleeding gastric ulcers is also extensively researched but almost invariably involves endoscopy and laser coagulation or similar therapy. Ironically, in one of the few studies looking specifically at the treatment of canine gastric ulceration secondary to neurosurgery and steroid administration, it was concluded that neither omeprazole nor misoprostol was effective in healing or preventing the development of gastric mucosal lesions [87]. This is in contrast to the prevention of gastric ulceration in human beings using NSAIDs, where the use of either a prostaglandin analogue or proton pump inhibitor proved beneficial [88]. Thus, unfortunately, attempting to draw conclusions regarding the treatment of canine gastritis from the current literature is a precarious exercise at best. This is further complicated by the inherent variability in what constitutes appropriate treatment for the myriad of conditions falling under the heading of \u201cgastritis.\u201d The correct therapy may range from emergency exploratory laparotomy to simply the withholding of food on an outpatient basis. Assuming appropriate steps are taken to rule out gastrointestinal obstruction, a brief period of gastric \u201crest\u201d (withholding food but not water for 24\u201348 hours) is usually sufficient therapy for resolution in cases of simple acute gastritis. If symptoms persist or worsen during the period of gastric rest or return shortly after the reintroduction of food, further treatment should be superseded by more extensive diagnostics (eg, complete blood work with appropriate ancillary tests, repeat radiographs, or more advanced imaging).",
