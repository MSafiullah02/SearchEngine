The progressive replacement of traditional chemical catalysts by enzymes and an expanding range of applications drive a growing demand for these environment-friendly biocatalysts [1\u20133]. Among the emerging industrial enzyme applications, the use of cellulases to obtain fermentable sugars from lignocellulosic biomasses stands out as a promising alternative towards low-carbon and renewable technologies. The cost-efficient enzymatic deconstruction of non-edible lignocellulosic materials, mainly agroindustrial residues, is expected to enable the use of this large and mostly untapped source of carbon for the production of biofuels and value-added chemicals [4\u20138].",

This market dominance arises from, among other factors, the use of proprietary microbial platforms and production processes which have been continuously developed for decades. Industrial strains of the ascomycete fungus Trichoderma reesei are among the main platforms employed for enzyme manufacturing, accounting for the production of up to 80% of enzyme formulations currently utilized in the lignocellulosic biofuels industry [11, 12]. T. reesei\u2019s predominance in this sector stems from its innate ability to efficiently break down lignocellulose through the coordinated secretion of an unexpectedly small set of carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes). Although not fully comprehended, the formidable action of these enzymes is believed to be favored by the fungus\u2019 diverse membrane-trafficking system and clustered genome organization [13].",

            "text": "All industrial T. reesei strains and most strains used in academic research nowadays originate from T. reesei isolate QM6a, which was originally isolated in the Solomon Islands during World War II [14]. Starting in the early 1970s, random mutagenesis techniques were used to develop several hypercellulolytic mutants of QM6a [15\u201317]. One of these strains, the RUT-C30, has been intensively studied in academic research and used for the industrial production of cellulases [18, 19]. Available in the public domain and with a well-characterized genetic background, RUT-C30 presents a large 85-kb chromosomal deletion and a truncated cre1 gene, among a series of other mutations compared to QM6a [20\u201322]. Cre1 encodes a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that mediates carbon catabolite repression (CCR) of cellulase genes by glucose in T. reesei. As a result of the cre1 truncation, RUT-C30 presents a partial relief of CCR by glucose, being capable of reaching extracellular protein titers of up to 20 g L\u22121 [18, 23, 24]. Highly developed industrial strains of T. reesei have been reported to reach cellulase titers in excess of 100 g L\u22121 [25]. Nevertheless, experimental data regarding the development of these strains, enzyme productivity or the production processes employed to reach such titers remain mostly unavailable to the scientific community. In general, the enzyme production capacity of T. reesei strains used in academic research falls far below that ascribed to industrial variants. For instance, in a study where the proprietary strain VTT-M44 was engineered for enhanced cellulase production, an enzyme titer of 37.3 g L\u22121 (0.20 g L\u22121 h\u22121) was reached using a low-cost process [26]. This is one of the highest experimentally supported protein titers so far described for T. reesei. Despite major achievements in the molecular understanding of factors controlling enzyme production in this fungus, the development of strains capable of reaching industrially relevant levels of cellulase production still poses a challenge.",

            "text": "Several genetic modifications have been associated with increased cellulase production by T. reesei (reviewed in [12, 27, 28]). For instance, the transcription factor XYR1 has been identified as the major regulator of cellulase-encoding genes in this filamentous fungus and its constitutive expression has been shown not only to increase overall enzyme production, but also to relieve CCR by glucose [29, 30]. Further CCR relief has been achieved with the introduction of individual point mutations (V821F and A824V) in a conserved regulatory region of XYR1 [26, 31]. These mutations are thought to lead to changes in the secondary structure of the protein, causing a \u201cglucose-blind\u201d cellulase-expressing phenotype. Moreover, when the constitutive expression of xyr1 was combined with the RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated silencing of ace1, one of the main repressors of cellulase gene expression in T. reesei, even greater improvements in enzyme production were achieved [30, 32]. Other identified regulators of cellulase expression include the activators ACE2 [33], ACE3 [34], the HAP2/3/5 complex [35] and the putative methyltransferase LAE1 [36]. Some modifications that do not target the transcript levels of cellulase-encoding genes have also shown positive effects on cellulase production. A prime example would be the removal of extracellular proteases such as SLP1, a subtilisin protease, and PEP1, which is the most abundant aspartic protease found in T. reesei secretome. The deletion of the corresponding slp1 and pep1 genes and of other protease-encoding genes has been associated with increased protein secretion rates [37]. Numerous modifications aimed at improving the quality of the enzyme cocktail secreted by T. reesei have also been reported. The implementation of lacking enzymatic activities through the expression of heterologous enzymes such as lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) [38] and ligninases [39] has been shown to improve the saccharification efficiency of the produced cocktail. Most often, however, studies have focused on increasing its \u03b2-glucosidase activity, which is the most pronounced and long-studied deficiency of T. reesei secretome [40, 41].",

Therefore, significant efforts have also been made towards genetically modifying T. reesei in order to diversify the range of carbon sources that it can utilize for enzyme production. For instance, molasses derived from sugar manufacturing processes are inexpensive, soluble, highly concentrated and packed with vitamins and minerals, being often considered as a suitable carbon source for enzyme production [26, 43, 44]. Besides high contents of fructose and glucose, sugarcane molasses contain approximately 35% (w/w) of sucrose, representing about 65% of the total available sugar [45]. T. reesei lacks invertase activity as a typical secondary colonizer, thus being unable to utilize sucrose or sucrose-containing molasses [13, 46]. This issue has been addressed in previous studies through the engineering of T. reesei with the Aspergillus niger suc1 gene, which encodes an extracellular invertase [26, 46].",

Employing the developed strain and bioprocess, an extracellular protein titer of 80.6 g L\u22121 (0.24 g L\u22121 h\u22121) was achieved with high levels of cellulase and hemicellulase activities. The rational design of a publicly available T. reesei strain into a hyperproducing platform along with a simple bioprocess based on a low-cost carbon source represents an important step towards new alternatives for industrial cellulase production.

Yeast extract was added to the batch medium as an organic nitrogen source. During trial experiments, it was noticed that dissolved oxygen concentrations could be maintained at set values with higher sugar feed rates for Br_TrR03 than for RUT-C30. In order to make the comparison under the exact same conditions, sugars were fed to both strains at the rate which enabled maximum protein production with the parental strain. Under these conditions, RUT-C30 produced 12.5 g L\u22121 of extracellular proteins in 168 h (0.07 g L\u22121 h\u22121), while BR_TrR03 reached a protein concentration of 34.9 g L\u22121 (0.21 g L\u22121 h\u22121) (Fig. 3a). These results confirmed a near threefold increase in enzyme productivity for Br_TrR03 compared to RUT-C30. Still, some of the medium components used in the performed fermentations, such as lactose and Avicel, were very costly, making the application of this process on an industrial scale highly unlikely. As such, we set out to develop a process for cellulase production with the engineered BR_TrR03 strain based on inexpensive and sugar-rich sugarcane molasses.",

In an initial test, yeast cells were propagated in rich YEPD (yeast extract peptone dextrose) lab medium, washed and then added to the fungal batch medium. The replacement of yeast extract with YEPD-grown yeast cells resulted in a decrease in productivity of approximately 10% (Fig. 3b), with Br_TrR03 producing 41.7 g L\u22121 of extracellular proteins in 168 h (0.25 g L\u22121 h\u22121). Despite the decreased productivity, the obtained results demonstrated the viability of using whole yeast cells as an organic nitrogen source in the fungal medium. We therefore proceeded to test the use of non-washed molasses-grown yeast cells as a replacement for yeast extract. In this experiment, yeast cells were propagated in a standard molasses and salts medium, centrifuged and then added directly to the batch medium. With the molasses-grown yeast, Br_TrR03 reached an extracellular protein concentration of 42.9 g L\u22121 in 168 h (0.26 g L\u22121 h\u22121), a result similar to that achieved with YEPD-grown yeast (Fig. 3b). This fermentation was extended to 336 h (14 days), time at which Br_TrR03 reached a protein titer of 80.6 g L\u22121 with an overall production rate of 0.24 g L\u22121 h\u22121.",

To address this question, Br_TrR02 was cultivated in a bioreactor with the medium containing sugarcane molasses and molasses-grown yeast (MMGY medium). Due to a lack of invertase activity by Br_TrR02, the sucrose in the molasses was inverted by acid hydrolysis prior to the experiment. In an initial fermentation it was determined that Br_TrR02 could not be cultivated with a sugar feed rate as high as the one used for Br_TrR03. Under these conditions, it was not possible to maintain the dissolved oxygen concentration at set values, as Br_TrR02 generated a more viscous culture broth. The feed rate was then optimized for this strain and the experiment repeated. Under these adjusted conditions, Br_TrR02 displayed an enzyme production rate considerably lower than that of Br_TrR03, reaching a protein titer of 59.2 g L\u22121 in 310 h (0.19 g L\u22121 h\u22121) (Fig. 3b). This experiment still left open the possibility that the acid hydrolysis of molasses impacted its nutritional properties, affecting the performance of Br_TrR02. To address this concern, Br_TrR03 was cultivated in MMGY medium containing acid-inverted molasses. As depicted in Fig. 3b, Br_TrR03 displayed an almost identical performance to that exhibited with the non-inverted molasses, reaching a protein titer of 79.7 g L\u22121 in 336 h (0.24 g L\u22121 h\u22121). Lastly, to further validate the obtained results, the Br_TrR02 strain was reconstructed starting from a RUT-C30 stock acquired from a different collection (Br_TrR02B). When cultivated in bioreactors containing the MMGY medium, Br_TrR02 and Br_TrR02B presented virtually identical enzyme production rates (Additional file 1: Fig. S2).",

The transcription of cellulase-encoding genes was targeted through the simultaneous modification of two major transcription factors, xyr1 and ace1. In a previous report, the constitutive expression of xyr1 combined with the RNAi-mediated silencing of ace1 resulted in an increment of 103% in enzyme secretion by RUT-C30 in Avicel medium [30]. This improvement was, however, drastically reduced when the modified strain was grown in glucose. In comparison, the constitutive expression of xyr1-V821F and the simultaneous deletion of ace1 in the engineered Br_TrR02 strain resulted in an increase of about 220% in enzyme production in both lactose and glucose media. The greater enhancements observed in our experiments are likely due to the V821F mutation introduced in XYR1, as large improvements in both enzyme production and CCR relief have also been observed when the xyr1-V821F allele was constitutively expressed in a proprietary T. reesei strain [26]. Additionally, the presence of the intact wild type xyr1 allele in the genome of the engineered strain may influence the effect of the constitutive expression of its mutated counterpart. XYR1 can form homodimers when inducing the expression of cellulase genes [57]. The presence of the two forms of XYR1 in the cell nucleus would therefore result in the formation of three types of dimers, each of which may have a different effect on the regulation of cellulase gene expression.",

Protease deficient fungal strains have been shown to produce greater quantities of extracellular enzymes [37, 58, 59]. It has been speculated that this enzyme-boosting effect may be due to a compensatory response by the fungi to the reduced availability of nutrients from protein breakdown. An additional possibility raised is that the reduced proteolytic activity of the enzyme cocktail increases the stability of secreted native proteins. In the developed Br_TrR03 strain, two of the major proteases found in T. reesei secretome, SLP1 and PEP1, were removed. These enzymes have been shown to, respectively, account for 18% and 42% of the total proteolytic activity against casein in the secretome of a proprietary T. reesei strain [37]. This same study showed that the deletion of six protease-encoding genes, including slp1 and pep1, reduced in over 93% the proteolytic activity of the secreted cocktail and led to a 22% increase in cellulase production. In shake flask cultivations with equal amounts of sugar available to each of our engineered strains, the deletion of neither slp1 nor pep1 had a major effect on cellulase production. In contrast, under controlled bioreactor fermentations, it was observed an increase in enzyme productivity of approximately 24% for Br_TrR03 that carried both slp1 and pep1 deletions when compared to Br_TrR02, harboring only the slp1 modification. This result is likely associated with the higher feed rates enabled by Br_TrR03. Nevertheless, no definitive conclusions about the individual effects of the slp1 and pep1 gene deletions can be drawn given that these modifications were performed simultaneously with the insertions of the cel3a and suc1 genes, respectively.",

And in fact, when yeast extract was added to the batch medium, Br_TrR03 exhibited an enzyme productivity of 0.28 g L\u22121 h\u22121. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the highest cellulase production rate so far reported for T. reesei. The highest rate previously described was 0.23 g L\u22121 h\u22121 [61].

However, a detailed techno-economic analysis would be required to accurately assess the cost-competitiveness of the produced cellulase cocktail. In addition to a potentially low cost, the MMGY medium brings the added advantage of a reduced number of medium components that must be outsourced. As with other manufactured goods, fluctuations in quality and availability of raw materials may directly impact the properties and price of the finished enzyme product [11]. The use of molasses to generate yeast cells would remove the need for the additional outsourcing of a suitable organic nitrogen source. The approach of using whole yeast cells as nutrient for enzyme production may be especially appealing to lignocellulosic and corn-based ethanol factories which routinely cultivate yeast and have a demand for large quantities of enzymes.",

            "text": "Besides displaying increased production rates, the engineered Br_TrR03 strain produced a cellulase cocktail with higher specific enzymatic activities and significantly better saccharification efficiencies than the parental RUT-C30. The major improvement in \u03b2-glucosidase activity is likely due to both the insertion of the cel3a gene, driven by the xyn1 promoter, and the constitutive expression of the transcription factor xyr1. The constitutive expression of xyr1 is known to particularly increase transcription levels of hemicellulase-encoding genes, including xyn1 [29]. This would also help to explain the fact that a considerably greater increment was observed for the specific activity of xylanase as compared to cellulolytic activities, such as cellobiohydrolase and endoglucanase. Greater enhancements of hemicellulolytic activities were also observed in a previous study where a proprietary T. reesei strain was engineered with the same xyr1-V821F allele as Br_TrR03 [26]. The effectiveness of the enhanced \u03b2-glucosidase activity exhibited by our engineered strain was evidenced in the performed saccharification assay with an industrially pretreated biomass at high solids content. While deconstruction of the pretreated biomass with the RUT-C30 enzyme cocktail led to the accumulation of cellobiose, minimal quantities of this disaccharide were detected with Br_TrR03 cocktails, which presented a saccharification performance similar to that of the commercial cellulase preparation CTec2. Also, the addition of the whole fermentation broth from the Br_TrR03-MMGY fermentation did not affect the saccharification efficiency of the cocktail. In the scenario of on-site manufacturing (OSM) of cellulases, the use of unprocessed whole fermentation broths has been proposed as a cost-reducing alternative for lignocellulosic biorefineries as it would avoid transportation, storage and downstream processing-related expenses [65\u201367].",

These results indicate that although the newly developed strain does not require inducing sugars for efficient cellulase production, the profile of the secreted cocktail is still affected by the medium composition. The understanding of the molecular basis of the observed differences, possibly through transcriptome and secretome studies, may reveal candidate gene targets and help guide the further development of the fungal platform. Additional improvements in the saccharification efficiency of the produced cocktail may also be achieved through the implementation of lacking enzymatic activities. The same is true for the enzyme productivity displayed by the fungus, which might be improved through the modification of additional transcription factors and protease-encoding genes.",

The AMA1 fungal plasmid replicator fragment was excised from the ANEp7 vector through NotI-HF (NEB) digestion and agarose gel purification [68, 69]. The remaining 5 fragments were PCR-amplified with primers containing BsaI restriction sites. If required, internal BsaI sites were removed by overlap extension PCR or during the design of purchased constructs. The Ppdc1_ToCas9_Tpdc1 fragment was amplified from a construct containing the Cas9 gene from Streptococcus pyogenes with a SV40 nuclear localization signal, codon-optimized for expression in T. reesei [49] and flanked by the pdc1 gene promoter and terminator sequences (supplied by GenScript, Piscataway, USA). The eno1 promoter [56] and xyn1 terminator fragments were amplified from genomic DNA of strain IHEM_5652. The hph cassette [70] and the pUC19 backbone [71] fragments were amplified from pre-existing plasmids. PCR products were gel-purified, digested with BsaI-HF (NEB) and then column-purified. Adjacent fragments (ii and iii; iv and v; i and vi) were first ligated pairwise with T7 DNA ligase (NEB) at 25 \u00b0C for 4 h. The 3 ligation reactions were then combined and incubated at 25 \u00b0C for another 4 h before electroporation into E. coli. Pairs of internal primers specific to the ends of each DNA fragment were used to screen obtained transformants by colony PCR. Correct assembly of the plasmid was further confirmed through Sanger sequencing. A Bsp1407I restriction site located between the eno1 promoter and the xyn1 terminator in the pTrCas9gRNA1 plasmid was used to generate CRISPR/Cas9 vectors for targeting of specific T. reesei genes. For each target gene, a DNA fragment containing a chimeric guide RNAs (gRNA) sequence flanked by (5\u2032-end) hammerhead (HH) and (3\u2032-end) hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme sequences was generated and inserted into the Bsp1407I site (GenBank MN555452\u2013MN555454) [53, 72]. These insert fragments were generated by assembly PCR of two ssDNA oligonucleotides (98 bp and 158 bp) with a 23 bp overlap and subsequent digestion with FastDigest Bsp1407I (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, USA). Correct insertion of each fragment in the Bsp1407I-digested pTrCas9gRNA1 plasmid was verified by colony PCR and Sanger sequencing.

The batch composition for experiments with molasses and yeast-based medium was 20.0 g L\u22121 (NH4)2SO4, 30.0 g L\u22121 of sugars from sugarcane molasses and 20.0 g L\u22121 of an yeast-derived organic nitrogen source (yeast extract, YEPD-grown yeast or molasses-grown yeast preparations). The batch composition for fermentations with the molasses and ammonium sulfate medium was 30.0 g L\u22121 (NH4)2SO4 and 40.0 g L\u22121 of sugars from sugarcane molasses. In all fermentations, 1.0 mL L\u22121 of J647 antifoam (Struktol, Stow, USA) was added. 2 M phosphoric acid and 10% ammonia solutions were used for pH control. Aeration, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH and temperature parameters were set and maintained as described by Ellil\u00e4 and colleagues [26]. In the synthetic medium fermentations, a solution containing 300 g L\u22121 of glucose and 200 g L\u22121 of Lactose was fed from 40 to 168 h at a rate of 1.0 g L\u22121 of sugar per hour. In all other experiments with Br_TrR03, sugarcane molasses was fed from 44 to 168 h at a rate of 1.0 g L\u22121 of total sugars from sugarcane molasses per hour. For experiments using the molasses-grown yeast preparation, the feed was extended to 336 h. In the bioreactor fermentations with Br_TrR02 and Br_TrR02B, (acid-inverted) sugarcane molasses was fed from 48 to 310 h at a rate of 0.65 g L\u22121 of total sugarcane molasses sugars per hour. Feeding was started when a reduction in growth by the fungus was observed. This was indirectly monitored through the volume of ammonium hydroxide solution required to maintain a stable pH. Initial batch volumes of 1.0 L were used, and the bioreactors were inoculated with 100 mL of a 3\u20137 days old shake flask preculture of the same media composition as the fermentation batch medium.

The last point of the fermentations with RUT-C30 and Br_TrR03 on inducer-rich medium and Br_TrR03 with the MMGY medium were used for enzyme activity and saccharification assays. A non-centrifuged sample (whole broth) from Br_TrR03 with the MMGY medium was also collected and frozen for the saccharification assay. Due to its low protein concentration, the sample from the RUT-C30 fermentation with the inducer-rich medium was concentrated using a Vivaspin Turbo 15, 10,000 MWCO column prior to its use in saccharification assays.",

Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) was used as a standard. Filter paper activity (FPase) was measured using the standard method described by Ghose [80]. The \u03b2-glucosidase and \u03b2-xylosidase enzymatic activities were measured using the substrates 4-nitrophenyl-\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside (pNPG) and 4-nitrophenyl-\u03b2-d-xylopyranoside (pNPX), respectively. Reactions were carried out in 50 mM citrate buffer, pH 5.0, for 10 min at 50 \u00b0C and terminated with one volume of 1 M Na2CO3. In order to quantify the released 4-nitrophenol (pNP), absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Standard curves were prepared with pNP solutions of known concentrations. Cellobiohydrolase activity was measured with the 4-methylumbelliferyl-\u03b2-d-lactopyranoside (MUL) substrate. MUL is mainly hydrolyzed by T. reesei\u2019s cellobiohydrolase I (CBHI) enzyme. The action of \u03b2-glucosidase (\u03b2G) and endoglucanase I (EGI) account for no more than 15% of measured activity [81]. Following incubation at 50 \u00b0C for 10 min, reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 volume of 1 M Na2CO3. Quantification of released 4-methylumbelliferone (MU) was accomplished by measuring fluorescence at 445 nm with an excitation wavelength of 380 nm. Endoglucanase activity was measured using carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), while xylanase activity was measured using beechwood xylan as a substrate. Both reactions were carried out in 50 mM citrate buffer, pH 5.0, at 50 \u00b0C for 5 min (xylanase) or 10 min (endoglucanase) and stopped by the addition of 1.5 volumes of 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) reagent, followed by heating at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min. Absorbance was measured at 540 nm in order to quantify the released reducing sugars. Pure glucose or xylose solutions were used as standards.
