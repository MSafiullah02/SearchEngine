From November 2002 to June 2003, SARS-CoV spread to many countries on several continents and brought great suffering to people with regard to health and economy. Through the efforts of an international team it was identified as a new type of coronavirus [1]. Like the other 3-group coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV genome is about 30 kb in length, encodes four major structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E) and membrane (M) glycoproteins and nucleocapsid (N) protein, and has several small nonstructural open reading frames found between the genes for S and E and between the genes for M and N [2, 3].",

Previous studies indicate that N proteins of other coronaviruses are extensively phosphorylated, highly basic, and associated with viral RNA to form a helical ribonucleoprotein, which comprises the viral core structure. The biological function of coronavirus N protein is thought to participate in the replication and transcription of viral RNA and interfere with the cell cycle processes of the host cells. Importantly, the N protein in many coronaviruses is highly immunogenic and abundantly expressed during infection [2, 3, 4, 5]. This suggests that the N gene might be very critical in the prophylaxis and diagnosis of the SARS-CoV infection.",

            "text": "Genetic immunization with DNA vaccines induces both antibody and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) because they are expressed through the class-I and class-II antigen-processing pathway [6]. Therefore, DNA vaccine approaches have been applied to generate protective immunity to various pathogens [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], but to date the strength of the immune response induced by DNA vaccines has been relatively weak compared with conventional vaccines. A variety of strategies are being developed to increase DNA vaccine efficiency. Some approaches use the co-injection of plasmids coding for immune-enhancing genes such as interleukin-2 or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [13, 14]. Others aim to facilitate DNA uptake, such as the use of liposomes, encapsulation into microparticles, or bacteria [15, 16, 17]. However, currently one of the most successful protocols is the recombinant viral vector in combination with DNA vaccine. The advantage of such recombinant viral vaccines is their high efficacy in generating humoral and cellular immune responses. A number of different viruses, such as adenovirus, vaccinia, rabies virus, canarypox virus, simian immunodeficiency virus and murine leukemia virus, have been used to construct recombinant viral vaccines [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. Among these, the replication-defective recombinant adenovirus is viewed to be a favorably choice as a viral vector vaccine, since it appears to be both safe and to induce strong humoral and cellular antigen-specific immune responses [25, 26, 27, 28].",

At E:T cell ratios of 25:1, 50:1 and 100:1, there were no significant differences among the four combinations of pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N/rAd-N, pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N/rAd-N/rAd-N, pcDNA3.1-N/rAd-N/rAd-N/rAd-N, and rAd-N/rAd-N/rAd-N/rAd-N in the induction of the SARS-CoV-N-specific CTL response. Each of them was more efficient than the pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N combination using the pcDNA3.1-N prime-rAd-N boost regimen as well as the negative control. However, the pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N/rAd-N combination induced the maximum (about 75%) cell lysis activity at an E:T cell ratio of 100:1 (p < 0.05; fig. 6a).",

            "text": "Genetic immunization is an encouraging approach to the development of more effective vaccines in the control of some severe viral infections [31]. To prevent and control the re-emerging and transmission of SARS-CoV, except for inactivated vaccine experiments [32, 33, 34], several different research reports on DNA vaccines of SARS-CoV have been recommended, such as S gene recombinant DNA vaccine [35, 36, 37, 38], N gene recombinant DNA vaccine [39, 40], and a combination of S, M and N gene recombinant DNA vaccines [41, 42]. These genes are delivered and expressed by different plasmids or viral vectors and elicit different levels of humoral and cellular immune responses. DNA vaccine has been shown to possess several important advantages, including the ability to induce CTLs and antibodies through the class-I and class-II antigen-processing pathways, but its efficacy does not meet our expectations [43, 44]. Different methods have been tried to increase the effectiveness of genetic immunization. Priming with a DNA vaccine can augment the efficacy of vaccines based on recombinant viral vectors. The rationale behind this strategy is that DNA priming elicits low-level but persistent immunity followed by strong boosting with virus encoding the same recombinant antigen as the DNA encodes [45]. The ability of the prime-boost regimen to induce a higher response than the DNA vaccine or virus vaccine alone may relate to the ability of recombinant adenovirus to interfere with the maturation of infected dendritic cells, decreasing their ability to present Ag to CD4 T cells, while preserving efficient Ag presentation to CD8 T cells [46, 47]. So far, the most successful DNA immunization is likely to be a consecutive immunization involving priming with plasmid DNA and boosting with recombinant virus [48, 49, 50].",

For instance, Schneider et al. [51] demonstrated that heterologous priming immunization with plasmid DNA followed by a single boost with a recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara provided complete protection against Plasmodium berghei sporozoite challenge and induction of high levels of epitope-specific CTLs in mice, whereas other combinations, including virus followed by DNA, DNA followed by DNA, and virus followed by virus, did not induce significant protection at all. Thus, DNA priming followed by virus boosting seems to be the best regimen in prime-boost immunization. However, Matsui et al. [45]. reported that DNA prime-virus boost immunization is not absolutely superior to the reverse sequence in the induction hepatitis C virus core-specific CTLs in mice. They found that the prime-double boost immunization with pCEP4-core (DNA vaccine) priming followed by pCEP4-core and AdexlSR3ST (virus) boosts (pC/pC/aC) has a similar efficacy compared with the combination aC/pC/pC. Furthermore, compared to homologous vectors, heterogeneous vectors induce a strong antigen-specific immune response, and the mechanism of this may be that priming with a DNA plasmid vector seems to decrease the development of immune responses to the viral vector itself [45, 52, 53].",

The results of our experiments demonstrate that the DNA vaccine (pcDNA3.1-N) prime-adenovirus vector (rAd-N) boost regimen greatly enhanced the induction of a humoral and cellular immune response.

Regarding the ability to induce a humoral response, immunization with rAd-N/pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N at week 6 and immunization with rAd-N/rAd-N/pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N at week 8 produced similar levels of SARS-CoV-N-specific antibody response to the immunization with pcDNA3.1-N/ pcDNA3.1-N/pcDNA3.1-N/rAd-N.",
