Also, modifications in the poly(I) strand (i.e., 7-N substitution by a CH group) could be introduced without detrimental effects on the IFN-inducing ability of the resulting double-stranded RNA complex [18]. Moving into the other direction, by introducing modifications in the poly(C) strand (i.e., interruption of this strand every twelfth or thirteenth cytidine residue by uridine), poly(I)\u00b7poly(C) analogues such as poly(I)\u00b7poly(C12U) were constructed that still induced IFN while being apt to a faster degradation by nucleases [19].

Adefovir dipivoxil corresponds to the bis(pivaloyloxymethyl)ester of 9-(2-phosphonomethoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA; figure 5), a compound that was first mentioned for its antiviral properties in 1986 [24]. Adefovir dipivoxil has proved to be efficacious in the treatment of both e antigen\u2014negative and e antigen\u2014positive chronic hepatitis B [25, 26]. It has been firmly established that adefovir acts as a chain terminator in the reverse transcriptase (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase) reaction [27], and this by itself could explain the reductions in HBV DNA titers achieved in vivo by the therapeutic doses used for adefovir dipivoxil (10 mg daily orally)",

Therefore, at least in the long term, hepatitis C may be better manageable by IFN and ribavirin when due to HCV genotypes 2 or 3 rather than genotype 1. The mechanistic basis for this differential behavior remains to be unraveled",

Ribavirin had relatively weak antiviral activity in the HCV (genotype 1b) replicon system (we have not yet examined the effects of IFN and ribavirin in HCV replicon systems with other genotypes).

In fact, VSV could be considered a surrogate virus of the filoviruses, in that anti-VSV activity may be predictive of activity against filoviruses. This premise has been borne out with S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase inhibitors such as 3-deazaneplanocin A (figure 7); on the basis of its activity against VSV [44], it was tested in treating Ebola virus infections in mice, and a single dose protected the mice against a lethal challenge with Ebola virus [41]",

On one hand, 3-deazaneplanocin is a potent inhibitor of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase [45]; on the other hand, 3-deazaneplanocin has been shown to massively stimulate the production of IFN-\u03b1 in Ebola virus\u2014infected mice [46]. Considering the unequaled potency of double-stranded RNAs to induce IFN, I hypothesize that as an S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase inhibitor, 3-deazaneplanocin leads to the accumulation of S-adenosylhomocysteine, which, being a product and inhibitor of methyltransferase reactions using S-adenosylmethionine as methyl donor, will inhibit these methylation reactions, including those that are required for the 5\u2032-capping of the viral mRNA [45]. In the case of negative-stranded RNA viruses (such as Ebola), it means that the positive-stranded RNA (transcribed from the minus strand by the RNA replicase) is not processed and remains attached to the negative-stranded RNA, thus resulting in increased double-stranded RNA formation and, consequently, IFN induction. Further experiments should be undertaken to validate this hypothesis",
