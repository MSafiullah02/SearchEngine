Normal BBB maintains a unique microenvironment within the central nervous system (CNS) [2]. The early stage of inflammation involves adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes across the BBB to the normally isolated CNS. This process is regulated by the expression of adhesion molecules. One of the most well-known components is the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). It has been described as a ligand for the membrane-bound integrin receptors for the lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) and monocyte adhesion molecules-1 (Mac-1) on leukocytes. It is involved in the adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes. Some studies have demonstrated ICAM-1 upregulation in many tissues after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Recent studies tend to focus on its effects on brain tissues in acute diseases, but neglect possible differences between the brain and the spinal cord following traumatic lesions. Yang et al. demonstrated the upregulation of ICAM-1, LFA-1, and Mac-1 in the spinal cords of LPS intraspinal injected rats, and the location of ICAM-1 in microglia cells. These results suggest a possible role of this molecule in microglia-mediated immune response and antigen presenting in CNS immune diseases [3].",

It shares the common gamma-chain with IL-2, IL-4 and IL-15, but in addition it also binds to the unique IL-21R alpha chain and activates JAK/STAT pathway. IL-21 influences the proliferation of T cells and B cells into memory cells and differentiates plasma cells to augment the activity of natural killer cells. It regulates the innate and acquired immune response. IL-21 contributes to the differentiation of the na\u00efve T lymphocytes to strongly pro-inflammatory Th17 cells and is implicated in immune-inflammatory diseases [4]. The presence of IL-21 and IL-6 may decide about the T cells differentiation towards Th17 phenotype rather than immunoregulatory T reg phenotype, defining the type of response to a given antigen. Th17 cells secrete IL-21 themselves, creating a possible positive feedback mechanism.",

However, Infante-Duarte et al. observed that Borrelia burgdorferi sl. spirochetes and their sonicates elicit a Th17 response in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells culture [7]. Codolo et al. identified borrelial NapA protein as a factor inducing synthesis of IL-23 in human monocytes and neutrophils. Antibodies against NapA are detected in serum of 48% of patients with Lyme arthritis and Th lymphocytes from synovial fluid of patients with Lyme arthritis react specifically to NapA with release of IL-17A, suggesting the response to this protein is essential in developing Th17-like inflammation in Lyme arthritis [8].",

ICAM-1 binds to its leukocyte ligands and allows activated leukocytes entry into the CNS [11]. Doerck et al. suggest, that adhesion molecules are not only important for capture and migration of pro-inflammatory T cells into the central nervous system, but also permit access of anti-inflammatory cells, such as regulatory T cells.

Th17 cytokines includes proinflammatory interleukins (IL)-17, 6, 21, 22, 23 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1. It suggests their important role in the immunopathogenesis of MS as the neuroinflammatory reaction is a prominent feature of this disease [20]. In the course of TBE CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells display different localization. Compared to CD8+ T cells, considerably greater numbers of CD4+ T cells are retained within the perivascular spaces.
