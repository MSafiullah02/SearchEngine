There are three major reasons for quantitative detection of viral DNA or RNA. The first reason is that the amount of virus ('viral load'), which is usually reflected in the amount of viral DNA or RNA present, can be an indication of the seriousness of the infection. This was first demonstrated for HIV by using a quantitative HIV-1 bDNA technique. An increasing amount of HIV-1 RNA genomes in plasma was directly correlated with a decrease in CD4+ T-cells, with disease progression and HIV-1 induced mortality.

For EBV, it was shown that a viral load >10 3 copies/ml is predictive for the development of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease.

Vertical transmission (from mother to child during pregnancy or at birth) is an example. Vertical transmission of HIV can be prevented either by decreasing the viral load during pregnancy by antiviral therapy, or by performing a caesarian section. For hepatitis B virus, it is also shown that the risk of vertical transmission is directly related to the viral load of the mother. Infection can be prevented by immediate active and passive vaccination of the newborn. However, the risk of vertical transmission is still present if the mother has a high viral load (>2 \u00c2 10 8 IU/ml).

Measures taken after accidental contact comprise monitoring of viral load in both the victim of the needle stick accident and the patient and/or preventive antiviral treatment. Vice versa, health care workers may also infect patients. Several countries have taken measures to prevent transmission of viral infections to patients.

First, the sampling procedure and the handling of samples may influence the test results. For example, varicella zoster virus is a cell-associated virus.

Scraping of the bottom of the vesicle, where most virus-infected cells are present, may result in a very high viral load. Second, the viral load may not fluctuate too much in relation to the time that is needed to generate a quantitative test result. In acute viral infections, the virus load increases quickly to very high levels and decreases after that. For many acute viral respiratory infections it is not possible to show a relation between the viral load and the seriousness of the respiratory disease.

Treatment with Interferon aims at improving the antiviral response of the immune system, at reducing viral susceptibility of cells by enhancing Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)-antigen expression and at inducing cellular proteins that are important in the natural defense of cells against viruses. This leads to immune control of the chronic hepatitis B infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Hepatitis B"}, {"text": "Direct-acting antivirals (DAA's, nucleotide-or nucleoside-analogues) that are available for the treatment of an infection with the hepatitis B virus are lamivudine, adefovir, telbivudine, tenofovir and entecavir. One mutation, called the YMDD motive, is associated with resistance to lamivudine. The YMDD motive is a conserved sequence in the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase gene of hepatitis B virus consisting of tyrosine (Y), methionine (M), and two aspartates (DD). Replacement of the methionine by isoleucine (YIDD) or valine (YVDD) leads to resistance. Since the polymerase and hepatitis B surface antigen genes overlap, replacement of nucleotides may also lead to changes in the surface antigen. Therefore, the mutations also have an impact on the production and secretion of the HBsAg. Lamivudine has long been the only treatment option for hepatitis B, but now has been replaced by other more potent antivirals, like entecavir and tenofovir. Entecavir, however, is less effective in patients who have been pretreated with lamivudine and who carry the YMDD variant of hepatitis B. Genotyping and resistance testing of hepatitis B can be performed by sequencing and comparing the sequence to reference strains, but LiPA assays have also been developed for genotyping and for the detection of mutations associated with resistance.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Hepatitis B"}, {"text": "As an alternative to HIV and hepatitis B treatment, which aims at long-term suppression of the virus, the treatment of the hepatitis C virus aims to totally clear the virus from the host. In the past decades, hepatitis C was treated with a combination of interferon-alpha and ribavirin. Nowadays, an increasing number of direct-acting antivirals (DAA's) are available. Several viral proteins involved in the HCV lifecycle, such as the non-structural (NS) 3/4A serine protease, the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the NS5A protein, are targets for these drugs. NS5A plays a role in the formation of a replication complex of the virus and in the release of new viral particles. The Hepatitis C virus has 7 major genotypes, all with different prevalence and different responses to treatment. Genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 are most prevalent in western countries. Genotyping can be performed with a LiPA assay, but sequence-based assays have also been developed. First-generation protease-inhibitors telaprevir and boceprevir are active against hepatitis C genotype 1, but they are less effective and therefore not registered for other genotypes. New NS3-protease-inhibitors are registered for treatment of genotype 1 and 4. Polymerase inhibitors and NS5A inhibitors show less genotypic specificity.

For HSV 1 and 2, 7-14% of patients that receive treatment with acyclovir, or similar medications like valaciclovir and famciclovir, become resistant. Up to 95% of resistance to acyclovir is associated with mutations in the thymidine-kinase gene (UL23). Viral thymidine-kinase phosphorylates acyclovir, which is a necessary step in the antiviral mechanism of acyclovir, before it can act as a nucleotide analogue to disturb viral DNA synthesis. Acyclovir-resistant variants may still be sensitive to foscarnet. Foscarnet blocks DNA polymerase, thereby inhibiting viral DNA synthesis. Mutations in UL30 (polymerase-gene) are associated with resistance to foscarnet. In both genes, many polymorphisms may be present.

The influenza A species consists of different strains, designated according to the structure of their haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes. These are the most variable viral proteins and are involved in attachment to the target cell and fusion with the endosomal membrane. Influenza viruses have a segmented RNA-genome (8 segments), the NA and HA-coding sequences are on different segments and can be exchanged. HA is encoded on segment nr 4 and NA on segment nr 6. Within influenza A, there are at least 16 HA-encoding segments known, of which segments numbered H1-H5 are known as human variants, and 9 NA-variants. Recombination of influenza variants may lead to new combinations of H-and N-genes (antigenic shift), whereas mutations in the H-and N-genes lead to new variants with slightly different properties (antigenic drift). This antigenic drift causes that for instance two A(H3N2) strains may have slightly different antigenic properties.
