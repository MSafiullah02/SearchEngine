            "text": "Our patient was a 13\u2010month\u2010old male baby at the time of transplant. He was born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and underwent staged palliation with a Norwood procedure with Sano modification followed by a bidirectional Glenn procedure at 5 months of age. His Norwood procedure was complicated by bilateral vocal cord paresis requiring tracheostomy. He remained hospitalized until his Glenn procedure and was discharged on a home ventilator from which he was subsequently weaned. He developed clinical heart failure from moderate\u2010to\u2010severe tricuspid insufficiency with associated ventricular dysfunction several months after his Glenn procedure that resulted in the initiation of an aggressive medical regimen including spironolactone, furosemide, enalapril, and carvedilol, with doses being optimized for weight gain. Over the following months, he required several hospitalizations for viral infections, each leading to worsening of congestion but never requiring inotropic support. He was fully immunized, including having received 2 doses of the inactivated influenza vaccine at 10 and 12 months of age in accordance with current national guidelines. He additionally received monthly injections of palivizumab. One month prior to transplant, he developed severe congestion with poor perfusion, anuria, and reduced responsiveness. This resulted in admission to the critical care unit, where a milrinone infusion was started along with reinstitution of positive pressure ventilation via his tracheostomy. Due to this episode of decompensation without an obvious precipitating event, he was evaluated for transplant and listed status 1A. His blood type was O with elevated anti\u2010A and anti\u2010B isohemagglutinin titers, so he was listed for ABO compatible transplant. He remained hospitalized through transplant for resistant congestion despite his milrinone infusion and enteral heart failure regimen. After one month on the waitlist, a heart became available. Our patient developed fever on the day of the organ offer with the only additional symptom being nasal congestion. A respiratory viral panel obtained with the fever was reported the next day to be positive for coronavirus and rhino/enterovirus.",

The donor had presented after a respiratory arrest following a short illness with a cough. As part of the evaluation for the respiratory arrest, the donor's nasopharyngeal secretions exhibited influenza A positivity by polymerase chain reaction testing. Chest radiograph demonstrated diffuse pulmonary interstitial markings consistent with pneumonitis or edema, and a bronchoscopy demonstrated purulent secretions with mixed gram\u2010negative and gram\u2010positive organisms, but no pathologic organisms were found. Cardiac structure and function were normal by echo. The donor progressed to brain death over the next 36 hours, during which time 3 doses of oseltamivir were administered. When our center accepted the organ, a dose of oseltamivir was administered to our recipient, and twice\u2010daily dosing was continued for 10 days post\u2010transplant. Graft function was excellent immediately after transplant, and an endomyocardial biopsy on post\u2010transplant day 14 revealed no rejection. Respiratory viral panels on our recipient were positive for coronavirus and rhino/enterovirus but negative for influenza on post\u2010transplant days 5 and 10 and negative for all viruses on post\u2010transplant day 15. He never developed symptoms of a respiratory infection and was discharged from the hospital on post\u2010transplant day 15. His immunosuppression was not modified in response to his potential donor influenza exposure, including 1 day of solumedrol 10 mg/kg, 5 days of 1.5 mg/kg/dose thymoglobulin and solumedrol 3 mg/kg/d, 60 mg/kg/dose mycophenylate twice daily, and tacrolimus twice daily starting on post\u2010transplant day 5 with a target range of 10\u201012. Additional immunosuppression consisted of 2 g/kg of intravenous immunoglobulin for a positive T\u2010 and B\u2010cell crossmatch on post\u2010operative day 1.",

This reluctance does not extend to either cytomegalovirus or Epstein\u2010Barr virus status as these are both common and, at least for cytomegalovirus, there is effective medical therapy. Organ donation from hepatitis C\u2010positive donors to hepatitis C\u2010negative recipients is increasingly utilized in adult transplantation due to the recent development of highly effective antiviral agents, which can then be used to treat the recipient.5 Given the expanded repertoire of anti\u2010infectious agents against viruses and other microorganisms, infections previously thought to render a donor heart unacceptable for transplantation are being reconsidered.",

            "text": "We recently published the first case report of a pediatric patient receiving a heart transplant from a donor with symptomatic influenza B disease. The donor had received a full course of oseltamivir and was documented to have tested negative for influenza B before organ harvest.10 Our recipient received a 10\u2010day course of oseltamivir therapy, and disease transmission did not occur. The present case documents that the use of oseltamivir in donor and recipient, even without a complete course in the donor, may be adequate to mitigate the risk of influenza A transmission. There has been uncertainty in cases in which donors are positive for influenza as to need for and duration of therapy of both the donor and recipient.9 In 2010, the American Society for Transplantation, The Transplantation Society, and Canadian Society of Transplantation endorsed recommendations that influenza\u2010positive donors be considered for non\u2010lymphoid solid organ transplant, and, while acknowledging inadequate supporting data, suggested a full course of antiviral therapy be used prior to organ procurement whenever possible.11 It is also of note that the Center for Disease Control maintains updated information in regard to specific antiviral resistances reported, which may play a role in antiviral therapy choice.12 However, in 2009, one United Kingdom group reported success with 13 solid organ transplants from H1N1\u2010positive donors, of which three had not completed therapy, and only seven of the recipients received any antiviral therapy. They reported no cases of influenza A viral transmission, and our experience also supports this approach in pediatric heart transplant.13 This suggests that an inability to completely treat a donor with a full oseltamivir course may not be a contraindication to transplant, and using organs of incompletely treated hosts may expand the pool of donor organs.",
