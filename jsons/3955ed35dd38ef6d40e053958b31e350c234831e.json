Previous studies have shown that fatty acids (FAs) play an important role in IAV replication and that inhibition of FA biosynthesis can diminish viral replication. However, cellular lipids can either be synthesized intracellularly or be imported from the extracellular environment. Interfering with FA import mechanisms may reduce the cellular lipid content and inhibit IAV replication. To test this hypothesis, MDCK and Detroit 562 cells were infected with IAV followed by exposure to palmitic acid and inhibitors of FA import. Replication of IAV significantly increased when infected cells were supplied with palmitic acid. This enhancement could be reduced by adding an FA import inhibitor. The addition of palmitic acid significantly increased the cellular lipid content, and this increased level was reduced by treatment with an FA import inhibitor. These results show that reducing the cellular lipid level might be an approach for IAV therapy.",

            "text": "Influenza A virus (IAV) is an important virus that causes respiratory diseases in humans and many animal species worldwide. The IAV subtypes that have been circulating in humans are H1N1 and H3N2. In the 20 th century, there were three major IAV pandemics: Spanish flu in 1918 (H1N1), Asian flu in 1957 (H2N2), Hong Kong flu in 1968 (H3N2). In 2009, WHO declared that a new strain of swine-origin H1N1, known as \"swine flu\", was responsible for the first pandemic of the 21 st century. The major concept of antiinfluenza drugs for humans is targeting conserved viral components that are critical for viral replication. Two types of anti-influenza drugs are commonly used, matrix protein 2 (M2) ion channel blockers and the neuraminidase inhibitors. A new class of cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor (baloxavir marboxil) has been approved recently for treatment of influenza. However, resistance to the available drugs is a major public-health concern, and development of alternative treatments is required [16, 28] .",

            "text": "All viruses depend on cellular factors to complete their replication cycle. Among the host cell factors that are essential for viruses, cellular lipids play a key role in the viral replication cycle. Some viruses can regulate cellular metabolism of infected cells by altering cellular lipid metabolism to support viral replication. Increases in both fatty acid synthesis and lipid beta oxidation have been shown to be induced by various viruses [1, 12, 22, 24, 34] . Like other viruses, IAV has been shown to alter cellular lipid metabolism. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of IAV-infected mice has been shown to have significantly increased levels of fatty acids, including palmitic acid, oleic acid, and linoleic acid [6] . Inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis can inhibit IAV infection. Pharmacological inhibition of fatty acid metabolism pathways can be achieved by treatment with TOFA (5-tetradecyloxy-2-furoic acid), an inhibitor of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and C75 (trans-4-carboxy-5-octyl-3-methylene-butyrolactone), an inhibitor of fatty acid synthase (FASN). These enzymes play important roles in the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway. Treatment with both compounds has been shown to cause a significant reduction in IAV replication [26] . Moreover, fatty acids have been shown to play a role in virion assembly and membrane fusion. Palmitoylation (S-acylation) is the post-translational attachment fatty acids (including palmitic acid) with a thioester-typelinkage to cysteine, serine, and threonine residues of proteins, usually peripheral and integral membrane proteins. IAV contains two palmitoylated (S-acylated) proteins: the spike protein HA (haemagglutinin) and the proton channel protein M2. Eliminating the acylation site of viral HA results in defects in genome packaging and irregular morphology. Viral particles possessing HA with deleted palmitoylation sites show defects in viral replication and reduced levels of viral nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix protein 1 (M1) [3, 4, 30, 36] . This indicates that fatty acid metabolism may play an essential role in IAV infection.",

            "text": "Most cells, with the exception of liver and adipose cells, have little capacity for de novo fatty acid synthesis and rely on uptake of fatty acids from extracellular source for their needs [18] . Extracellular fatty acids are taken up through the plasma membrane. Fatty acids can separate from lipoproteins and travel across the plasma membrane by simple passive diffusion [32] . However, there other are two fatty acid import mechanisms that depend on membrane-associated proteins. First, transmembrane protein CD36, originally called fatty acid translocase (FAT), is an 88-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein [35] that can function alone or together with plasma-membrane-associated fatty-acid-binding protein (FABP pm ) as an acceptor for fatty acids [9] . Second, fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1) is a 71-kDa protein belonging to the FATP/Slc27 protein family that localizes to high-density membranes [38] . This protein enhances cellular uptake of fatty acids and is expressed in several insulinsensitive tissues [21] . Modulation of the fatty acid import mechanism can affect cellular lipid metabolism. In previous studies, overexpression of murine FATP1 was shown to increase LCFA uptake and triacylglycerol accumulation [13, 20] . Disruption of the FATP1 homolog in yeast was found to significantly impair LCFA uptake, and FATP1 knockout mice showed reduced muscle acyl-CoA levels with increased insulin sensitivity [7, 17] . In animal models, CD36 overexpression in muscle of mice increased fatty acid oxidation and decreased plasma lipids, while deletion of CD36 impaired fatty acid uptake by key metabolic tissues and increased plasma fatty acid and triglyceride (TG) [10] .",

The protein concentration was measured using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad, California, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Thirty micrograms of each protein sample was mixed with 4x loading buffer and boiled at 70\u00b0C for 10 minutes. The protein samples were loaded into a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen, California, USA) along with the molecular weight marker and separated by electrophoresis at 110 V for 90 minutes. The separated protein bands were then blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane by placing the gel into 1X transfer buffer for 10 minutes and then placing the gel on the membrane and assembling a filter paper stack as a sandwich (avoiding air bubbles). The proteins were transferred to membrane using electroblotting (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK) at 40 mA for 75 minutes. The blotted membrane was briefly rinsed in distilled water and stained with Ponceau S solution (Cell Signaling Technology, Massachusetts, USA) to check the transfer quality. After washing five times with washing buffer (0.1% Tween 20 in TBS) to remove the Ponceau S solution, the approximate sizes of protein bands of CD36 (75-100 kDa) and GAPDH (35 kDa) were marked. The membrane was cut for detecting CD36 and GAPDH (housekeeping protein) separately according to the size of protein bands. The blot was blocked then with blocking buffer (3% skim milk and 0.2% Tween 20 in TBS) at room temperature for 1 hour. After washing three times with washing buffer, the blot was probed with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-CD36 rabbit monoclonal antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) or a 1:5000 dilution of anti-GAPDH mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Texas, USA) diluted in the blocking buffer as the primary antibody and incubated overnight with gentle agitation on a rocker at 4\u00b0 C.

Supplementing infected cells with palmitic acid might enhance viral replication by increasing lipid availability in the infected cells. The same palmitic acid concentration (100 \u00b5M) that significantly increased the cellular lipid content also increased IAV replication. Previous studies have demonstrated alterations in lipid metabolism upon viral infection [1, 12] . Some viruses take control of cellular metabolism by promoting synthesis of fatty acids to enhance energy and facilitate the formation of the viral lipid membrane [22, 24] . Lipids are an energy source that is utilized during viral replication. Some viruses such as hepatitis C virus can induce lipid metabolism at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional steps, which can lead to increased lipid oxidation and ATP generation. Dengue virus infection can induce the process of autophagy, which leads to degradation of lipid droplets. Lipids released from these droplets are oxidized in mitochondria to generate ATP [24, 34] . Moreover, several reports have shown that fatty acids play a critical role in IAV replication. Bronchoalveolar lavage samples from IAV-infected mice have been shown to contain increased levels of fatty acids, including palmitic acid. Palmitic acid plays a role as a component of the viral spike protein HA (haemagglutinin) and the proton-channel protein M2 via palmitoylation, which has been shown to affect the association of the virus with membrane rafts, the entry of IAV into target cells by HA-mediated membrane fusion, and the release of newly assembled virions from infected cells [3, 4, 30, 37] . In addition, inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis by TOFA (an inhibitor of acetyl-CoA carboxylase) and C75 (an inhibitor of fatty acid synthase) has been shown to reduce IAV replication [26] . However, fatty acid synthesis mainly occurs in liver and adipose cells [18] , while the major targets of human influenza A virus infection are ciliated epithelial cells in the upper respiratory tract [15] .",

This study was conducted in both MDCK and Detroit 562 cells. MDCK cells are the most commonly used cell line for IAV culture, and Detroit 562 cells are human pharynx epithelial cells originating from target area of human influenza A viruses infection. Although we did not know whether the inhibitors would work with the canine fatty acid transporters, both target proteins (CD36 and FATP1) are highly conserved in mammals. It has been reported previously, that SSO inhibits CD36 in both humans and rats. This compound inhibits oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) uptake by human macrophages (THP-1) by about 50% [19] and modulates metabolism in diabetic heart tissue of Wistar rats by reducing fatty acid uptake [23] . The amino acid sequences of CD36 of humans and rats (Rattus norvegicus) are 86.9% identical, while those of humans and dogs (Canis lupus) are 83.2% identical. Between dogs and rats, percent identity in amino acid sequence of CD36 is 87.4%. FATP1 is a very-long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase that facilitates fatty acid uptake via esterification-coupled influx [5, 11] . The arylpiperazines inhibit the acyl-CoA synthetase activity of human and mouse FATP1 [25] . Previously, those compounds were tested by oral administration to mice, but a reduction in tissue triglyceride (TG) accumulation was not observed [25] . The FATP1 amino acid sequences, of humans and mice (Mus musculus) are 89.5% identical. The percent identity between human and dog (Canis lupus) FATP1 is 92.7% and between dogs and mice, the percent identity is 88.1%.",
