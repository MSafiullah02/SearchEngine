The majority of cats in the stray room had behavioral evidence of domestication and the majority of the cats in the feral room did not. While objective measures were not applied, the investigators and shelter staff overall believe that these behavioral differences could be perceived as greater stress in cats in the feral room. In addition, the differences in the parasite prevalence rates (23.1% in the feral room; 9.2% in the stray room; P= .0066) emphasize the differences in case management before entering the shelter. However, we believe that by dividing the study into 2 periods where the SF68 supplemented room and placebo supplemented rooms were switched and inclusion of the parasitism rates in the analysis should have adequately accounted for these variables. Although no studies have been done to demonstrate the stability or sensitivity of SF68 in the environment after gastrointestinal transit, the cages were cleaned and disinfected daily and so the 7\u2010day period should have been adequate to allow any residual organism to die.",

            "text": "In the dogs, statistical differences were not noted but this may have merely related to the low number of dogs that had diarrhea for \u22652 days over the course of the study (1 in each group). As stress diarrhea is common in dogs that are boarded, this finding was unexpected. The median duration of stay for the SF68 and placebo groups was 2 and 3 days, respectively. Therefore, the opportunity to detect diarrhea that continued for \u22652 days in the dog population was low. The shelter staff was also requested to collect all abnormal feces (FS\u22654) from any animal included in this study because the dogs defecated at irregular times during the day. As there were several shelter employees that cleaned the runs during a 24\u2010hour period, it is possible that some diarrhea samples were discarded unintentionally. Other reasons for this low occurrence of diarrhea are purely speculative. It is possible that stress to dogs housed in these 2 rooms was minimal as there are only 14 runs per room and the runs are large. The shelter staff anecdotally believes that the dog diarrhea rate in the study period was lower than in previous years. The major change compared with previous years is that in this study, a consistent ration was fed. In previous years, food donations from multiple sources were used and so the dog rooms were rarely fed the same diet consistently and some diets donated may have been of low quality. A larger study in dogs will be required to further evaluate for effects of SF68 on diarrhea rates in shelters or other stressful environments.",
