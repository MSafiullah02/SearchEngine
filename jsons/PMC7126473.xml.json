            "text": "Bismuth compounds such as bismuth subsalicylate (BSS) and colloidal bismuth subcitrate (CBS) have been widely used for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders for several decades [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), a gram-negative micro-aerophilic bacterium, is believed to be the major cause of gastritis and contributes to the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer disease. The effectiveness of bismuth has been attributed to its bactericidal action against H. pylori. Enzyme inhibition is thought to play an important role in the action of bismuth containing drugs. The mechanism by which bismuth inhibits the growth of H. pylori is still not well understood. It has been demonstrated previously that bismuth drugs can inhibit cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) from H. pylori\n[8], [9], [10]. ADHs are zinc metalloenzymes that catalyze the oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes or ketones:R-CH2-OH+NAD+ \u2192ADH R-CHO+NADH+H+where NAD+/NADH are coenzymes (NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NADH, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide).",

Acetaldehyde\u2013protein adducts could further inhibit protein secretion, displace pyridoxal phosphate from its binding sites in proteins or impair some biological functions of enzymes [14], [15], [16]. The acetaldehyde\u2013protein adduct may form in gastric mucosa and would subsequently interfere with the mucosal defense factors that cause gastrointestinal morbidity. The inhibition of ADH by bismuth drugs has been shown to suppress the production of acetaldehyde, which is toxic to mucosal cells [10].",

            "text": "Similar to H. pylori ADH, yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (YADH, EC1.1.1.1) is a tetrameric enzyme with a molecular mass of 150 kDa. Each subunit contains two zinc ions with one zinc ion located at the active site and bound to two cysteines (Cys46, Cys174), and one histidine (His67) and a water molecule [17]. The other zinc ion is bound to four cysteines (Cys97, Cys100, Cys103 and Cys111) and maintains the tertiary structure of the enzymes. The Zn(II) sites are conserved among ADHs from different species (Scheme 1\n). The inhibition of ADH by bismuth has been previously suggested [18]. However, little is known about the mechanism of inhibition [19]. In this paper, we have characterized the inhibition and interaction of ADH with the anti-ulcer agent bismuth citrate using baker's yeast ADH as a model for H. pylori ADH since both ADHs have the same active sites and relatively high sequence identity (47%).",

            "text": "In spite of extensive use of bismuth in medicine particularly as anti-ulcer drugs [2], [3], the mechanism of action of bismuth still remains not clear. Enzyme inhibition and bismuth\u2013protein interaction appear to play a crucial role for bismuth anti-microbial activities. As a borderline metal ion, Bi(III) binds strongly to thiolate sulphur and oxygen, and can readily form stable complexes with thiolate-containing biomolecules such as, cysteine (and N-acetyl-l-cysteine), the tripeptide glutathione (GSH), and the cysteine-rich proteins metallothionein (MT) and metalloregulatory protein Cadc from Staphylococcus aureus\n[28], [29], [30]. The Bi\u2013metallothionein complex is stable even at highly acidic conditions (pH \u223c 1). The gradual increase in absorbance at \u223c350 nm upon addition of Bi(III) into YADH solution suggests that Bi(III) binds to the thiolate group of YADH, either to free cysteines or those bound at the Zn(II) sites. The thiolate content determined by DTNB confirmed the decrease in thiol groups (\u2013SH) by one per ADH monomer. Our ICP-MS study on intact YADH and in the presence of Bi(III) (separated by FPLC) showed an inverse correlation between Bi(III) and Zn(II), i.e., the more the Bi(III) added into the YADH solution, the lower the concentration of Zn(II) associated with the enzyme (and the higher the concentration of Bi(III) associated with YADH), until about one zinc(II) was replaced by Bi(III) per ADH subunit. This indicates that the binding of bismuth to thiolates group(s) subsequently leads to the replacement of Zn(II) by the metal. Zinc release, as monitored by ICP-MS, coincided with activity loss induced by increasing amounts of Bi(cit). Therefore, the mechanism of Bi(III) inhibition on YADH is probably due to its direct interference with Zn(II) sites. Since Bi(III) acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of ADH, only the structural Zn(II) with four cysteine residues bound is likely to be replaced by the metal. Recently we have showed that Bi(III) complexes effectively inhibit SARS coronavirus helicase (IC50\n \u223c 0.4 \u03bcM), again probably via interference with zinc sites in the N-terminus [31], which serves as a common feature for Bi(III).",

It is known that the active form of YADH is its tetramer and both its dimer and monomer are inactive [36]. Bi(III) induced YADH dissociation suggested that YADH denatured into dimeric intermediates and finally through its structural collapse in its monomers. The relative stability of the dimer indicated that YADH could be described as a \u201ctetramer of dimers\u201d with two identical interfaces. Previous study has demonstrated that an alcohol dehydrogenase from Kluyveromyces lactis (KlADHs) lost its activity once dissociated from structural active tetramer to a monomer and followed by complete unfolding with addition of more denaturant agent, guanidinium chloride [37]. Bi(III) regulated protein\u2013protein interaction is probably a novel mechanism of action and could be attributed to the binding of Bi(III) to residues (e.g., Cys) on the protein interfaces which further prevents the protein\u2013protein interaction. Surprisingly, the dissociation process causes little secondary structural changes of the enzyme as reflected from CD study (data not shown).",

            "text": "In summary, the work presented here shows that Bi(cit) can effectively inhibit YADH activity. Bi(III) binds to thiolate groups of YADH as it has a high affinity for thiolate sulphur. Both binding of Bi(III) to thiolate groups and the conformational change reflected by fluorescence data exhibited biphasic kinetics. YADH also gradually dissociated from native form tetramer to dimers in the presence of Bi(III). Inhibition of YADH was accompanied by binding to Bi(III) and replacement of about one zinc per monomer. Since Bi(III) inhibition of YADH is via a non-competitive mode, Zn(II) at the structural site with four Cys coordinated is likely to be replaced. As H. pylori ADH has the conserved zinc binding sites and a high sequence identity (47%) with YADH (Scheme 1), the inhibition of Bi(cit) on HPADH is probably via a similar way. It would be of interest for future work to investigate the inhibition of H. pylori ADH directly by bismuth compounds.",
