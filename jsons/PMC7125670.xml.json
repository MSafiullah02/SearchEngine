This modeling dates from the time of Fibonacci (the growth of a rabbit populations). It can be said that the foundations of mathematical epidemiology are based on models of compartments, and the structure of epidemic models is determined by the flow of individuals from one compartment to another in a population. Hence, in the literature various models are proposed namely, a simple model is the susceptible-infected model, in the SI model individuals can be in two states susceptible (healthy) and infected, SIR model is the susceptible-infected-recovered model, it\u2019s based on the assumption that an infected individual can recover after disease and can not be infected again, that is in contrast to SIS model in which individual can recover after disease and may be infected again and so on. The model prey-predator (1926), or model of Lotka-Volterra, plays a determinant role in dynamics of population and is considered as a basic conceptual model in population dynamics and also in mathematical epidemiology.",

Moreover in 2014 the fractional order SIS model has been developed with a constant population size [4] and with a variable population size [5], in both works the stability of equilibrium points of the model is studied, two years later mathematical model for the transmission of Ebola in human society has been presented [6], in the same year Ameen I and Novati P proposed numerical solution for fractional SIR model with constant population [7] by using discrete methods: Generalized Euler Method and Predictor Corrector Adams method, which is an implicit numerical scheme, also Okyere E et al. studied a fractional order extension of the SIR and SIS model by replacing the ordinary derivative by the Caputo fractional derivative [8], they used also Adams method to illustrate model solutions and Banerjee SK studied a fractional order SIS epidemic model with constant recruitment rate and variable population size [9], in 2017 Sun GQ et al. suggested a mathematical model to describe the transmission of cholera in the population of China [10], what is particular in this model is the environment-to-human transmission of the disease, Li L presented a dynamical model on hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in China [11], within the same frame Ahmed EM and El-Saka HA studied the transmission of a dangerous epidemic, called MERS-CoV using fractional order derivative [12], recently in 2018 Sigh J et al. considered a fractional epidemiological SIR model to describe the spread of computer virus [13].",

This method is generally effective only for small time intervals. However, using programming tools, this method becomes efficient to produce numerical results on a long time interval. In our model, some assumptions are taken in order to transform the system to one fractional differential equation for which the ordinary exact solution is calculated formally.",

In other context in the classical spread rules of infections the population is divided into a finite number of compartments and infections are controlled by the mass-action law (\u2212\u03b2NSI), in other words we suppose that each individual has the same probability to contact another one in the population, however, in a more realistic study, social relations and families sizes are not identical in the society, so the numbers of contacts differ from a susceptible individual to another, that gives rise to another possible study by modeling the epidemic as network with nods and edges, where nods represent individuals and edges represent a possible contact between two nods this complex study is proposed by Diekmann et al.
