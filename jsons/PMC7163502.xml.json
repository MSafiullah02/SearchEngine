            "text": "Of somewhat more than 180 Ropalidia species currently recognized, 27 species have been recorded from the Indian subcontinent (Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, and the eastern part of Myanmar), including 16 species so far known to be endemic to the subcontinent (Kojima & Carpenter 1997; Kojima 2006). Because of its well\u2010known historical geology in terms of plate tectonics, the social wasp fauna in the Indian subcontinent is of special interest from the view point of the biogeography of social wasps, especially for the groups occurring in Madagascar, the Indian subcontinent and Australia \u2013 that is, eastern elements of the Gondwana. The paper wasp genus Ropalidia Gu\u00e9rin\u2010M\u00e9neville, 1831, is one of the two such vespid genera; the other is the cosmopolitan genus Polistes Latreille, 1802.",

Gusenleitner (2001) added R. sculpturata from Nepal and R. tamila from Tamil Nadu in India (Gusenleitner 2004) to the Indian subcontinent fauna of Ropalidia. Recently, 2005a, 2005b) described six species from India, mainly referring to keys in Das and Gupta (1989). Unfortunately, the key to Ropalidia species in Das and Gupta (1989) is at least in part barely workable, because those authors adopted the subgeneric concepts applied by 1941, 1962) and Richards (1978), which often prevents correct identification at the species level (Kojima 1997). In the present paper, we give taxonomic notes on the Ropalidia species occurring in the Indian subcontinent, together with a key to species.",

The condition of the median furrow of the propodeum may differ between the species, but the distinction is often difficult. The female specimens we examined had their gena always narrower than the eye, about 0.65\u20130.7\u2010fold as wide as the eye. We were unable to recognize any distinct difference in the male genitalia between the species, even in the figures given in Das and Gupta (1989). Detailed comparison of the morphology among the specimens from various places (specimens from the localities other than in the Indian subcontinent are not listed) revealed that the two species can be distinguished by the shape of the first metasomal tergum as given in the key.",
