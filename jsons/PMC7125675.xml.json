Using poliovirus as a model system, selected juices were found to reduce in vivo poliovirus infectivity significantly. More recent studies showed in vivo and/or in vivo antiviral activity against human immunodeficiency virus type-I and Freund's leukemia virus by the plant extracts hypericin and pseudohypericin, from Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort) (Degar et al., 1992; Meruelo et al., 1988). New classes of antiviral compounds in the edible gypsy mushroom Rozities caperata, were reported recently. Specifically, in vivo antiviral activity by extract RC-183 from this mushroom was deemed effective in inhibiting the replication of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, varicella-zoster virus (chicken pox, zoster), influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (Piraino and Brandt, 1999). In the mouse model, intranasal and intraperitoneal administration of flavonoids (water-soluble plant pigments) inhibited the replication of influenza virus types A and B (Nagai et al., 1995).",
