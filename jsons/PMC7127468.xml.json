            "text": "Chronic renal failure (CRF) is considered to be a worldwide public health problem. At present, the prevalence of end-stage renal failure is reaching epidemic levels in the North Central Province (NCP) of Sri Lanka. The only process of sustaining life when at the end stage or the popularly known as fifth stage CRF, is routine dialysis or kidney transplantation. Type II diabetes and hypertension still remain the main causes of CRF. Due to the asymptomatic nature, CRF is not easily detected until it is at the end stage, resulting in lost opportunities for prevention. Treatments of infections like hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and Hantaviruses prevalent under tropical environments are complicated by renal diseases. Overuse and misuse of agrochemicals contribute to both acute and chronic renal failure. The ingestion of various fungi and fruit has been associated with renal injury (Eiam-Ong and Sitprija, 1998). In Thailand, renal tubular acidosis and renal stone disease have been reported (Vasuvattakul et al., 1996). Renal tubular acidosis also has been reported in areas of Papua New Guinea (Brown and Polume, 1994). In NCP of Sri Lanka chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis is common. Becker (2009) further reports that it is similar to aristolochic acid nephropathy, but without evidence of fungal ingestion. As reported by Wanigasuriya et al. (2009), in Sri Lanka, chronic renal failure not associated with diabetes, hypertension or snake bite was first reported in 2001, among the farmers in the major farming area under irrigation in NCP. It was first categorized as a chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology, following the format of Balkan Nephropathy which had similar ambiguous etiology (Athuraliya et al., 2009). However, the Balkan Nephropathy problems restricted to Bulgaria, Rumania and former Yugoslavia were later identified as a rare condition due to a Corona virus EBNV (Uzelac-Keserovi et al., 1999).",

Most are fed with the water from the Mahaweli River that originates in the central highlands of Sri Lanka (Fig. 1\n). Diverted Mahaweli River with a total catchment area of 10,000 km2 is passing through five provinces to reach NCP reservoirs after the 1970\u20131977 river diversion scheme adopted by Sri Lanka. An analysis of water samples collected from 21 tributaries of this river, showed that all the catchment areas contributed to its Cd load. The degree of contamination ranged from 5.1 to 23 \u03bcg/l. The minimum Cd contamination occurred in predominantly tea growing areas of the watershed, probably due to low input of Cd from the type of phosphate fertilizer used in tea plantations. Tea estates used direct unprocessed rock phosphate, namely Eppawala Rock Phosphate (ERP) at the rate of 123 kg/ha. The ERP is a rock phosphate obtained from a phosphate ore in Eppawala, Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka and it contains only 1.7 mg of Cd/kg compared to imported triple superphosphate a rock phosphate treated with sulphuric acid. TSP contains 23.5\u201371.7 mg/kg of Cd (Bandara et al., 2008, Premarathne, 2006). The total cadmium loading to the Mahaweli River from the catchment area in 1 year was estimated and was found to depend on the fertilizer regimes used in each cropping system, type of phosphate fertilizer, and the level of Cd present in the agrochemicals used. Mean Cd content of TSP used is 47 mg/kg based on the range 23.5\u201371.7 mg Cd/kg of TSP. Cadmium loading by the catchment under different farming systems as g/ha/year for rice = 26,479, tea = 23,987, vegetables and home gardens = 628,701 (Bandara et al., submitted for publication). The exchangeable Cd level in the upcountry soil varied from 0.32 to 1.24 mg/kg and the mean cation exchange capacity ranged from 11.7 in uncultivated soil to 36.4 cmol(+) per kg\u2014centimole of positive ions per kg of soil (formerly milliequivalent of ions per 100 g), in soils cultivated with vegetables (Premarathne, 2006).",

            "text": "The mean annual rainfall of 1450 mm is received in NCP in a very short period of 4 months and all the reservoirs in the NCP are fed with runoff water from rice fields. The total annual run off from 75,361 ha of rice fields, the mean total extent of rice sown per year and the rest of the catchment area in NCP, is 2.55 \u00d7 106\n ha m (hectare meter). The quantity of sediments brought in by runoff during the cropping season is very heavy. When reservoir bottom sediments were analyzed for heavy metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb and Zn), nephrotoxic elements Cd and Pb were detected at very higher level ranging from 1.78 to 2.45 mg/kg of soil (Bandara et al., 2008). Premarathne et al. (2005) reported the mean level of Cd in uncultivated soil in Sri Lanka as 0.39\u20130.51 mg/kg (Table 1). The Cd content in the soils on the periphery of reservoirs ranges from 0.56 to 1.05 mg/kg. When these reservoirs are at spill level, this area is usually submerged due to input from surface run-off during the rainy season. The bioavailability of heavy metals is affected by soil pH, soil organic matter, cation exchange capacity of the soil, other cations in the soil solution, oxidation and reduction reactions, their ability to form soluble complexes and the impact of soil microflora. Although Cd is highly mobile under acidic conditions, soil pH in the NCP is neutral to alkaline. Thus unlike in the upcountry tea soils which are rich in organic matter where the pH is around 4.5, the mobility of Cd in NCP soil is low. The K\nd, the ratio of metal concentration in soil to metal concentration in water is determined by the soil pH. The K\nd values of Cd at soil pH 4.5\u20139.0 is 1.3\u201326.8 (Bates and Sharp, 1983). However, in the bottom sediments of NCP reservoirs which are under reducing conditions, the solubility of Cd is high especially under the prevailing higher level of F\u2212 and Cl\u2212 content in water. The fluoride content in NCP is in the range of 1\u20133 mg/l and in certain areas of NCP it is the highest in Sri Lanka having more than 3 mg/l fluoride in ground water. In Medawachchiya where highest CRF occurrence is reported, fluoride level in ground water is 700 \u03bcg/l. Most NCP ground water contains high level of calcium (in CRF region it ranges 208\u2013220 \u03bcg/l) and the chloride content is more than 2000 mg/l (Dissanayake and Weerasooriya, 1985). Since cadmium is retained in soil by exchange reactions in the presence of cations, Ca++ compete better than Cd++ for adsorption sites in soil, resulting in more Cd++ in water. These environmental conditions in reservoirs of NCP and the groundwater favor more mobile Cd++. Ariyasinghe (2007) observed that the Cd tolerant bacterium Sphingomonas macrogoltabida isolated from Thuruwila reservoir in Anuradhapura of NCP, favors release of cadmium trapped in clay fraction or conversion of colloidal cadmium to exchangeable cadmium. The plant transfer coefficient of cadmium is known to be higher than other nephrotoxic heavy metals such as lead (Lehoczky et al., 2006).",

The cadmium content in rice grains collected from the farms of CRF patients in the NCP ranged from 0.001 to 0.194 mg/kg dry weight with a mean value of 0.0404 \u00b1 0.0196 mg/kg compared to a Sri Lankan background value 0.001 mg/kg. Rhizomes of 120-day-old N.\nnucifera stored seven heavy metals. Bandara et al. (2008) reported a mean concentration of 252.82 mg Cd, 237.73 mg Co, 47.86 mg Cu, 7975.0 mg Fe, 579.44 mg Mn, 16.32 mg Pb and 1461.79 mg, Zn per kg of rhizome. In this region the aquatic environment provides not only main plant based food but also the fresh water fish Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) as a protein source. Cadmium content in fish raised in fresh water reservoirs in the region significantly influenced the total dietary cadmium (Bandara et al., 2008). The estimated weekly intake of Cd from Tilapia and rice, containing 0.325 mg Cd/kg and 0.425 mg Cd/kg, respectively, fish collected from Thuruwila reservoir near Anuradhapura carrying 0.425 mg of Cd/kg and with a rice staple containing 0.194 mg Cd/kg (dw) varied from 28.39 \u03bcg/kg body weight in age group of 4\u20135 years and 15.48 \u03bcg/kg body weight in the age group of 40\u201349 years. In our subsequent studies on Cd residues in fish Tilapia and Lula (Channa striata) where samples were collected from fish landed from reservoirs near patients\u2019 houses, it was observed that the Cd content ranged 0.5\u201390.7 \u03bcg/kg with a mean of 21.8 \u03bcg/kg in herbivorous Tilapia compared to carnivorous snakehead C. striata (Lula) with a Cd content of 1.2\u2013114.4 \u03bcg/kg. Lula is a solitary, territorial, ambush feeder which consumes mostly worms, prawns, frogs, and especially other fishes. The young fry feed on algae and protozoans, while juveniles feed on small crustaceans. But the adults are highly carnivorous suggesting the potential biomagnifications of any contaminant in the reservoir.",

            "text": "CRF patients in the North Central Province of Sri Lanka are proteinuric with a mean 24 h urine protein excretion of 0.734 g/l (range 0.02\u20136.5 g/l). It was observed that 45.6% of the patients with persistent proteinuria had early renal disease. Their creatinine clearance (Cr.cl) values were >60 ml/min and 35% of the population had <30 ml/min with late stage of CRF. The mean Cr.cl value of the Madawachchiya, NCP population was 206 ml/min with a wider range of 1.3\u20131161 ml/min (Athuraliya et al., 2003). Abuelo (1995) defined Cr.cl values for renal failure as follows. 50 ml/min with established norms for normal adult male Cr.cl = 90\u2013139 ml/min and for female with a Cr.cl = 80\u2013125 ml/min. Tubular interstitial renal dysfunction was observed among the CRF patients. The ultrasonography of the kidneys of the patients reported a mean bipolar length of 8.3 cm with a standard deviation of the mean 1.4 cm. The biopsy reports of Madawachchiya patients in 2007 revealed that endocytosis and proximal tubular sclerosis were predominant but no glomerular renal dysfunction was observed, suggesting a potential involvement of chronic exposure to cadmium. Friberg et al. (1986) reported similar effects after long-term accumulation of Cd in the kidney. Female farmers resident in Jinzu River basin in the Toyama Prefecture, Japan exposed to elevated dietary Cd through consumption of high-Cd rice grown with polluted irrigation water developed Itai\u2013itai disease characterized by renal tubular dysfunction, osteomalacia and anemia (Yamagata and Shigematsu, 1970, Aoshima, 1987, Horiguchi et al., 2006, Watanabe et al., 2002). However, osteomalacia was not observed in Sri Lankan patients probably due to higher level of calcium and iron in drinking water in the NCP. It may be that the tropical climate with plenty of sunlight may not favor the occurrence of osteomalacia and the resultant \u201cOuch\u2013Ouch\u201d condition. The mean urinary cadmium concentration of patients confirmed as CRF with biopsy reports in Anuradhapura is 7.58 \u00b1 6.18 \u03bcg Cd/g cr and that of Pollonnaruwa is 5.65 \u00b1 5.46 \u03bcg Cd/g cr in the age group of 40\u201360 years (Bandara et al., 2008). An endemic form of CRF emerged in 2002 in the major farming provinces of Sri Lanka. A 2\u20133% mean prevalence is reported as background, the prevalence exceeds 10% in North Central Province and North Western Province of Sri Lanka, the traditional farming areas of lowland rice. The number of hospital-reported deaths due to CRF is 300\u2013600 annually; however the total number is \u223c1400 per year. In the North Western Province where the CRF has been recently reported, the death rate is 50\u201360 per year (Gunewardena, 2008). Disease is common among lowland rice cultivators and predominantly among young farmers with a male to female ratio of 4:1 (Gunewardena, 2008). Goonewardena et al. (2004) reported that the transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) accounted for 93.4% of primary bladder cancer in Sri Lanka. Exposure to elevated dietary Cd or cigarette smoking is known to cause the TCC (Kellen et al., 2009, Sens et al., 2004, Somji et al., 2006).",
