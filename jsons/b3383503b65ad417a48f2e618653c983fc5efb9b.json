Mortality risk is high in newborns with Plasmodium falciparum born to nonimmune women, who typically present at birth or soon thereafter. Semi-immune women are less likely to transmit malaria, and their children often become ill weeks after delivery with less severe symptoms. Cases in the USA usually trace to semi-immune immigrant mothers whose last exposure to malaria may have preceded the pregnancy, leading to misdiagnoses. Congenital malaria may be underrecognized in malaria-endemic areas since parasitemia occurring after the first week of life is usually attributed to mosquito transmission. Malaria prophylaxis and the absence of fever during pregnancy do not preclude congenital malaria in a newborn. Quinine plus clindamycin is commonly used to treat P. falciparum congenital malaria, and chloroquine is used to treat other malaria parasites, such as Plasmodium vivax. Severe cases should be managed with intravenous quinine (available as its enantiomer quinidine in the USA) or with intravenous artesunate, which was recently approved for investigational use by the US FDA. Primaquine is not required for infants with congenital P. vivax or Plasmodium ovale, but should be offered to their mothers after excluding G6PD deficiency.",

In areas of stable transmission, malaria has a distinct epidemiologic signature at the mother-newborn interface: pregnant women are relatively susceptible and newborns are relatively resistant [1] . Congenital malaria, defined as parasitemia transmitted from the mother to the child in utero or peripartum, is rare. Since the deadliest malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, sequesters in the maternal vascular spaces of the placenta, sometimes at extraordinarily high densities, the infrequent occurrence of congenital malaria cases has puzzled observers for more than a century. Despite the general observation that congenital malaria is uncommon and often indolent in its appearance, its true incidence is controversial and its outcome may be rapidly fatal when the mother lacks immunity. Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of congenital malaria in febrile neonates when the mother is from or has recently traveled to an endemic area, even if she reports no illness during pregnancy (Box 1).",

Mature parasite stages sequester in the intervillous (maternal) vascular spaces of the placenta by binding to the receptor chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) [8] . CSA-binding parasites are common in pregnant women but uncommon in nonpregnant individuals. Women lack immunity to the CSA-binding parasite before their first pregnancy, which might explain why primigravidae are highly susceptible [9] . Women who are exposed to malaria become resistant over successive pregnancies as they acquire antibodies against the placental CSA-binding parasites [9] . In areas of stable malaria transmission, multigravidae typically control parasitemia before symptoms or sequelae develop. Younger age and HIV infection also increase susceptibility to pregnancy malaria [10] .",

These women are at high risk of severe syndromes and death if they become infected, regardless of gravidity, and abortion or fetal death can occur during acute febrile or severe malaria episodes [11, 12] . Among semi-immune women in areas of stable transmission, severe maternal anemia and low birth weight are common sequelae of infection during pregnancy [13] , and these contribute to significant maternal and infant mortality. Placental malaria may also modify parasitemia risk in the offspring in a gravidity-dependent manner: in Tanzania, placental malaria was recently reported to decrease parasitemia risk in offspring of first-time mothers but to increase risk in offspring of multigravidae, and these effects persisted throughout infancy [14] . To prevent these poor outcomes, the WHO recommends that pregnant women throughout Africa receive intermittent presumptive treatment (IPT) and use insecticide-treated bed nets to reduce the risk of placental malaria, which might also reduce the risk of congenital malaria. Similar to P. falciparum, P. vivax has been reported to be more common during first rather than later pregnancies [3, 4] , although the basis for this epidemiology is not known. Mature stages of P. vivax do not sequester in the placenta or other vascular beds, nor do P. malariae or P. ovale have this property. Mature stages of P. vivax, P. malariae and P. ovale circulate freely in peripheral blood, and are therefore frequently detected in peripheral blood smears, unlike P. falciparum in which only the young parasite stages appear in peripheral blood smears. Congenital malaria is caused by blood-stage malaria parasites that are transmitted from mother to child. Pre-erythrocytic stages of the parasite -including the sporozoite form inoculated by the mosquito, and the liver stage forms that develop in hepatocytes during the first week of infection -are not known to cross the placenta nor to cause congenital malaria. Therefore, treatment of congenital malaria is intended to eradicate blood-stage and not liver-stage parasites in the newborn.",

Clinicians should be alert to the possibility that congenital malaria can arise even when the mother reports neither malaria episodes nor other febrile illnesses during pregnancy (Table 1) .",

Parasites transmitted from mother to child may be detected in the cord blood at birth, or in the infant's peripheral blood. In areas without mosquito transmission, malaria arising in an infant is presumed to be congenital malaria. In endemic countries, parasites must be detected within the first week of life to confidently diagnose congenital infection, as the incubation period of mosquito-transmitted infection is approximately 1 week. Clinical diagnosis of congenital malaria has relied on Giemsa-stained blood smear analysis. Detection of cord-blood parasitemia may be confounded by contamination of the sample with infected maternal blood. Soluble malaria antigen and genetic material can be transferred transplacentally, which may confound antigen-and DNA-detection assays.",

Since PCR is highly sensitive, contamination of cord blood by minute amounts of placental blood could cause false-positive PCR results. Furthermore, PCR-based assays are simply an amplification of nucleic acids, and it is possible that free nucleic acids are circulating independently of viable parasites [63] . For these reasons, prevalence studies using PCR assessment of cord blood may overestimate the true rate of congenital malaria in endemic settings.

Just as maternal erythrocytes are cleared from the neonatal circulation during the first days of life, so too have parasites been observed to clear from neonatal blood in endemic areas [54] . Congenital malaria in nonimmune populations has been studied less frequently, but the available data consistently suggest that motherto-child transmission is more likely in such cases, compared with semi-immune populations. On the Thai-Burmese border, where malaria transmission is low and women therefore have low levels of immunity, three congenital malaria episodes were documented among 213 deliveries [53] . This cohort included women who attended antenatal clinics that offered weekly malaria screening and treatment for all positive cases, which likely decreased the incidence of congenital infection. In colonial Nigeria, three clinical congenital malaria cases occurred among a sequential series of 37 offspring born to expatriate women, many of whom reported taking antimalarial prophylaxis during pregnancy [12] . In the early 1900's, when malaria was endemic in the USA, Thibault reported four cases of congenital malaria (including one infected stillbirth) among 249 newborns delivered by infected women [61] . Although these studies are relatively small, the incidence of congenital malaria, ranging from 1.4 to 8.1%, is fairly consistent across these diverse populations.",

For cases reported between 1991 and 2004, 44% of mothers reported that they did not travel to an endemic area during their pregnancy. Clinicians need to be alert to the fact that many mothers of children with congenital malaria were not exposed to malaria during pregnancy. The mother's time-to-last-exposure also reflects the persistence of malaria parasites in the human host. Between 1966 and 2005, 85% of mothers were exposed within 1 year prior to delivery [15] . However, the range of time between last reported exposure and delivery varied widely -from 36 h to 12 years -emphasizing that even a remote history of travel to an endemic area should be considered a risk factor [15, 64] . The woman reporting a last exposure 12 years before delivery was infected with P. malariae, which can persist for decades in asymptomatic individuals [16] . One woman whose child developed P. falciparum congenital malaria reported her last exposure in Haiti 7 years before delivery, which would be an unusually long period for this parasite species to persist, if true [15, 67] .",

In cases reported in the USA between 1997 and 2004, the distribution of parasite species differs substantially between congenital malaria, pregnancy malaria and nonpregnancy malaria cases (Figure 2) [19, 20, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Based on CDC surveillance data, pregnant women are significantly more likely to present with P. falciparum infection compared with infants with congenital malaria (Chi square, p = 0.0007) or to nonpregnant women (p = 0.0001). Conversely, P. vivax disproportionately appears as a cause of congenital malaria in US cases reported to the CDC (82%), followed by P. falciparum (9%) and P. malariae (9%). Only one case of P. ovale congenital malaria has been reported since 1966 [70] . These figures are similar to those reported from a survey of 27 cases in Thailand, where 81.5% of congenital malaria cases were due to P. vivax and 18.5% were due to P. falciparum [81] .",

Interestingly, the geographic origins of malaria cases in pregnant women are also significantly different from those of congenital cases (Chi square, p = 0.0002). Pregnant women were more likely to have acquired their infection in Africa, whereas congenital malaria cases originated from non-African sources (Figure 3 ). This may be due to differences in immune status of the mothers, genetic factors, transmissibility of different parasite species or reporting bias.",

Hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and irritability were more commonly reported to the CDC as positive findings before 1991 [64] , and the difference between the two reporting periods could be related to changes in the geographic origin of cases or to reporting bias. Misdiagnosis is frequent. Anemia is often misattributed to Rh or ABO incompatibility [87] , and the triad of fever, anemia and splenomegaly to one of the TORCH syndromes (toxoplasmosis, other [syphilis], rubella, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex) or to neonatal sepsis [64, 88] .
