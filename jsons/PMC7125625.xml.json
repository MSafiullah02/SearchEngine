We set up the nested PCR detection of the SARS-associated coronavirus Urbani strain (SARS-CoV) [2]. We used a synthetic RNA kindly provided by Pr Sylvie van der Werf as positive control.",

According to WHO case definition [1], out of the 69 hospitalized patients 18 were defined as suspect cases and 16 were contact patients. The PCR diagnosis was performed on each sample. We never detected the urbani coronavirus but common respiratory viruses in 24% of the cases. The most frequent virus was influenza A H3N2 (10 cases). Parainfluenza type 3 was almost as frequent (seven cases) while the other viruses were sporadic RSV (2 cases), influenza A H1N1 (1 case) and rhinovirus (1 case) (Fig. 1)\n. The influenza A viruses have been cultivated on MDCK cells for antigenic characterization. We grew seven strains, six H3N2 and one H1N1 all related to the vaccine prototype strains. The A H3N2 isolates were sensitive to the neuraminidase inhibitors [3].",
