Mannose-binding lectin (MBL), a key molecule in innate immunity, functions as an anteantibody before the specific antibody response. Here, we describe a case-control study that included 569 patients with SARS and 1188 control subjects and used in vitro assays to investigate the role that MBL plays in SARS-CoV infection. The distribution of MBL gene polymorphisms was significantly different between patients with SARS and control subjects, with a higher frequency of haplotypes associated with low or deficient serum levels of MBL in patients with SARS than in control subjects. Serum levels of MBL were also significantly lower in patients with SARS than in control subjects. There was, however, no association between MBL genotypes, which are associated with low or deficient serum levels of MBL, and mortality related to SARS. MBL could bind SARS-CoV in a dose-and calcium-dependent and mannan-inhibitable fashion in vitro, suggesting that binding is through the carbohydrate recognition domains of MBL. Furthermore, deposition of complement C4 on SARS-CoV was enhanced by MBL. Inhibition of the infectivity of SARS-CoV by MBL in fetal rhesus kidney cells (FRhK-4) was also observed. These results suggest that MBL contributes to the first-line host defense against SARS-CoV and that MBL deficiency is a susceptibility factor for acquisition of SARS.",

The most affected locations were mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and To-ronto, Canada [2] [3] [4] [5] . A novel virus, the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was identified as the etiological agent [6] [7] [8] and was subsequently confirmed by fulfillment of Koch's postulates [9] . The genome of SARS-CoV is sufficiently different from all previously known coronaviruses to warrant its designation as a new coronavirus group [10, 11] . The surface spike (S) protein is a major target of the host immune response to coronaviruses and plays an important role in the attachment and fusion of the virus to host cells. Postgenomic characterization of SARS-CoV has revealed that the glycosylation of this surface S protein is a high-mannose structure [12] , but knowledge of the pathogenesis of and immune responses to SARS-CoV is still limited.",

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter and coding regions of the MBL gene (mbl2) have functional effects on serum levels of MBL [20] [21] [22] . MBL deficiency increases the generalized susceptibility of an individual to infectious diseases [23, 24] . Increased susceptibility to infection by specific pathogens-including HIV, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Neisseria meningitidis-in MBL-deficient individuals has also been established [25] [26] [27] .

These 569 patients represented 59.0% of the total 965 patients with SARS who were admitted to these 5 hospitals during the above period. The male to female ratio was similar between the 569 study patients (249:320) and the whole cohort (410:555), and the mean (SD) age of the study patients (41.2 [17.2] years) was similar to that of the whole cohort (40.7 [17.8] years). The patients fulfilled the modified WHO definition of SARS [29] . Either SARS-CoV antibody seroconversion or detection of SARS-CoV RNA in respiratory secretions by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was documented for at least 95% of the patients. The SARS-CoV antibody and RNA test results were obtained from the Government Virus Unit, Department of Health, Hong Kong Government, and the Department of Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong. The demographic features and outcomes of the patients were obtained from the eSARS database, which is maintained by the Hospital Authority SARS Collaborative Study Group. EDTA whole blood and serum samples-which, after investigations, were archived in the departments of pathology of Pamela Nethersole Youde Hospital, Princess Margaret Hospital, Queen Mary Hospital, and United Christian Hospital-were obtained from the 569 patients with SARS for genotyping and MBL assay.",

The MBL mutant allele B is in linkage disequilibrium with the promoter polymorphism X/Y; therefore, B occurs only with Y [22] . To date, no exceptions to this association have been reported, and, accordingly, the data from the 2 separate TaqMan PCR reactions were combined to give 3 haplotypes: YA, YB, and XA. Therefore, 6 genotypes were identified in the present study: YA/YA, YA/XA, XA/XA, YA/YB, XA/YB, and YB/YB. YB is 1 of 3 mutant haplotypes commonly referred to as \"O\" [31, 32] . The other 2 known mutant haplotypes carrying structural polymorphisms, C (codon 57) and D (codon 52), were not tested for in the present study, since they are present at an extremely low frequency and probably were absent in the Chinese population [20, 21] . The frequencies of 2-locus haplotypes composed of the promoter and a structural allele were also estimated by performing the haplotype procedure of SAS/Genetic Software (version 8.2; SAS Institute), as described elsewhere [33] ; the expectation-maximization algorithm was used to generate maximum-likelihood estimates of haplotype frequencies, given that genetic-marker genotypes are under the assumption of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE).

Age difference between the groups was analyzed by use of an unpaired t test. Serum levels of MBL in any 2 groups were compared by use of the Mann-Whitney U test. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the association between SARS and MBL genotypes, after adjustment for differences in age and sex. Multiple linear regression analysis was also used to investigate factors that may determine serum levels of MBL: MBL genotype, age, sex, and disease status. A significance level of was used for all P ! .05 analyses. (table 1) . Three MBL haplotypes-YA, XA, and YB-were identified, where the mutant allele B is in linkage disequilibrium with the promoter alleles X and Y [22] . The distributions of the haplotypes in patients with SARS and in control subjects were in HWE ( and , re-P p .518 P p .778 spectively), and their frequencies were closely matched with that estimated by haplotype analysis (data no shown), in which the estimated frequency of XB was as low as 0.00004 in both SARS patients and control subjects, suggesting that the mutant allele B is very unlikely to occur with the promoter allele X. There was a significant difference between patients with SARS and control subjects in terms of their MBL genotypes (P ! .001) (table 1). Genotypes associated with low serum levels of MBL, with the mutant allele B, were significantly overrepresented in the patients with SARS. MBL haplotype frequencies also differed between patients with SARS and control subjects, and there was a significantly higher frequency of the haplotype associated with MBL deficiency, YB ( sis further revealed that MBL genotype and age were the significant factors that determined serum levels of MBL. The difference in serum levels of MBL between patients with SARS and control subjects was due to the significantly higher frequencies of genotypes with the mutant allele B, which was associated with low serum levels of MBL (figure 1), in the patients with SARS.",

SARS-CoV (100 TCID 50 ) preincubated in serum-free medium containing MBL at different concentrations (0.6-20 mg/mL) was added to confluent layers of FRhK-4 cells. After 24 h of incubation, the infectivity of SARS was determined by use of a real-time quantitative PCR specific to the 1b gene region of SARS-CoV, with extraction of viral RNA from the culture supernatant. MBL was found to have an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV infection, in a dose-dependent fashion (figure 5). Such inhibition was also observed in separate experiments that determined CPE in culture cells after 48-60 h of incubation; 175% inhibition of CPE was observed when SARS-CoV was pretreated with 5 or 10 mg/ mL MBL, whereas partial inhibition of CPE (25%-50%) was observed when SARS-CoV was pretreated with 1.25 or 2.5 mg/ mL MBL. No inhibition of CPE (i.e., 100% cells producing CPE) was found when SARS-CoV was pretreated with 0.6 mg/ mL MBL, a concentration similar to the median serum level (0.52 mg/mL) in healthy individuals with group II MBL genotypes (e.g., MBL B carriers).",

Increasing ORs (1.53, 1.81, and 2.21) were indeed observed in the individuals with genotypes carrying 1 mutant haplotype (YB) with a haplotype associated with high serum levels of MBL (YA), 1 mutant haplotype (YB) with a haplotype associated with low serum levels of MBL (XA), and 2 mutant haplotypes (YB) (i.e., YA/YB, XA/YB, and YB/YB, respectively). Since YB is associated with low serum levels of MBL, we further established that patients with SARS had serum levels of MBL that were significantly lower than those in control subjects. We conclude, therefore, that low serum level of MBL is a susceptibility factor for acquisition of SARS; this conclusion further supports the role of MBL as a first line of defense in respiratory infections, as has been documented in many other clinical settings [37] [38] [39] [40] . For example, polymorphisms associated with low serum levels of MBL have been associated with frequency of respiratory tract infections in children [37] , higher risk of invasive pneumococcal disease [38] , greater mortality and impaired lung function related to cystic fibrosis [39] , and more-frequent hospital admissions with respiratory tract infections related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [40] . Nevertheless, in the present study, XA (low-expression promoter) was not associated with susceptibility to SARS, possibly because the serum level of MBL in XA carriers was higher than that in YB carriers and was already sufficient to avert infection with SARS.",

MBL has been shown to function as an opsonin for other respiratory viruses, such as influenza A virus, and to inhibit hemagglutination and the infectivity of several strains of influenza A virus [28] . MBL inhibits hemagglutination and neutralizes the infectivity of influenza A virus by binding to the N-linked high-mannose carbohydrate side chain at the tip of the hemagglutinin S, thereby blocking the access of cell-surface receptors to the receptor-binding site on hemagglutinin [42] . Similarly, the S protein of SARS-CoV has 23 potential N-linked glycosylation sites [10] , and some of the sites are glycosylated with high-mannose structures [12] . MBL selectively binds to mannose, glucose, l-fucose, n-acetylmannosamine, and n-acetylglucosamine, whereas galactose is not bound [43] . Since the binding of MBL to SARS-CoV could be inhibited by mannan and since this binding was Ca 2+ dependent, it is likely that the binding of MBL to SARS-CoV is through the interaction of the CRDs of the MBL with the mannose side chains of the S protein of SARS-CoV.",

Anti-ACE2 antibody can block viral replication in African green monkey kidney cells (Vero E6) [44, 46] . Furthermore, a recombinant human antibody against the S1 domain of the S protein of SARS-CoV has been shown to neutralize the virus on Vero E6 cells and inhibit formation of syncytia between cells expressing the S protein and those expressing ACE2 [47] . MBL is a serum C-type lectin, and, here, we have demonstrated that MBL binds SARS-CoV per se or infected cells and inhibits the infectivity of the virus on rhesus monkey kidney cells. These findings therefore support the possible role of MBL in the host defense against SARS-CoV infection by targeting the S protein of SARS-CoV before production of specific antibody. Taken together, our findings suggest that MBL-deficient individuals are more susceptible to SARS, and they provide insight into the possible mechanisms of the innate immune response to SARS-CoV infection.

To determine the nature of binding of MBL to SARS-CoV, MBL was incubated in wells coated with SARS-CoV in the presence of either Ca 2+ or EDTA. The binding of MBL to SARS-CoV was reduced to background levels in the presence of EDTA, indicating that the interaction of MBL with SARS-CoV was Ca 2+ dependent.
