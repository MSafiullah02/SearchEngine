The extended connectivity fingerprints (ECFPs) are generated in a molecule-directed manner by systematically recording the neighborhood of each non-hydrogen atom into multiple circular layers up to a given diameter of that molecule. The functional-class fingerprints (FCFPs) [7] detail circular fingerprints via the pharmacophore identification of atoms, which reports topological pharmacophore fingerprints. The ALogP_count is an array of 120 numbers that correspond to the 120 Ghose and Crippen atom types [8] . The 613 descriptors in total were used for the AI practices and prediction of the promising drugs. All these descriptors were generated by Discovery Studio v18.1/Calculates ligand properties program (BIOVIA Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), including ALogP_count (101 descriptors), ECFP_4 (256 descriptors), and Fig. 1 Flow scheme of AI approaches along with antiviral activity verification assays. Two independent datasets were compiled as the learning inputs to generate two AI prediction models of different approaches. Firstly, Model 1 was generated form the known drugs with antiviral activities. Model 2 was generated form the 3C-like protease inhibitors. A database for the marketapproved drugs were adopted in which the AI system screens for potential drugs with antiviral activities. The AI-predicted drugs were verified with antiviral activities by a cell-based FIP virus replication assay. Finally, these assay results served as feedbacks for the AI relearning and evolution progress. The Modified AI model was established to screen further and again verified by the FIP virus replication assay.

We collected information of those compounds and drugs that had been reported with promising activities for treating COVID-19, such as anti-influenza drugs [10] , drugs and compounds inhibiting SARS-CoV [11] , HIV drugs [12] , and some showing activities against SARS-CoV-2 as recently reported [13, 14] .

GS-441524 is the active metabolite of remdesivir and showed activity against FIP virus at around 2 mM similar to the previously reported for GS-441524 being developed as a veterinary medicine treating feline coronavirus infections [4] . The results therefore provide solid evidence to support the validity of using cell-based FIP virus infection in vitro model as an antiviral activity assay in the present study. To have the promising drugs further being tested in a SARS-CoV-2 in vitro assay and in vivo animal models is planned to be ongoing. Among these AI-identified active drugs, four drugs (brequinar, clofazimine, gemcitabine and conivaptan) are of potential in their clinical uses and hereby elaborated further. Brequinar is a synthetic quinolinecarboxylic acid analogue and a dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitor with experiences of patients uses for antitumor activities [43] . It was also used as an immunosuppressant in combination with other drugs such as cyclosporine for synergism [44] . It is of high water solubility and given by IV infusion. The biodistribution studies in rats of brequinar showed that liver and small intestines were the most exposed organs. The elimination rate of brequinar from all tissues were approximately equal to that from the blood circulation indicating no tissue accumulation of the intact drug molecules [45] . The present finding demonstrated that brequinar has an inhibiting activity of 2e10 mM. The systemically exposed plasma concentration range of brequinar in patients are around 73e261 mM for doses of 135e300 m 2 /kg in 5-day infusion period suggesting that brequinar may be effective against coronaviruses in appropriate dose regimens given alone or in combination with others [44] .",

After 20 weeks treatment, the peak concentrations in lungs were 106 mg/g and 9020 mg/g in the lungs and spleen, respectively, in mice [46] . Clofazimine exhibited a dose-related relationship of tissue and serum concentrations (1.56e2.23 mM) from an oral dose of 100e300 mg in patients. A long onset of at least two weeks was observed in patients.

Side effects of gemcitabine include pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema, and adult respiratory distress syndrome. These pulmonary events could lead to fatal respiratory failure in some cases despite discontinuation of gemcitabine therapy 2 weeks ahead. A treatment regimen of low dose and frequency may be explored for single use against COVID-19 in animal models and for combined uses with the other drugs [50] . The present study revealed that the inhibitory activity of gemcitabine on coronavirus FIPV was approximately at 2 mM.
