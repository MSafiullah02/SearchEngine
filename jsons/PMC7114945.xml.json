This gap may allow leakage of airborne contaminants into the wearer\u2019s breathing zone, leading to ineffective protection. Because of this potentially ineffective protection, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) made fit-testing of N95 respirators compulsory for tuberculosis prevention before 2003. Both the CDC and the WHO recommended that fit testing should be carried out prior to the use of N95 respirators for SARS prevention.5, 6 Fit testing is now a mandatory measure for frontline staff working in infected areas in Hong Kong. During an epidemic of an airborne transmitted disease, there may be logistic difficulties in performing fit testing for all clinical staff.",

Nowadays, QNFT rather than QLFT serves as the gold standard in determining the fit.6, 7, 8 QNFT is an assessment of the adequacy of fit by numerically measuring the amount of leakage into the respirator.8 Using an electronic device, the ratio of specific particles in the air inside and outside the breathing zone when wearing the respirator is measured and this ratio directly reflects the quantity of leakage. By contrast, the QLFT is a pass/fail fit test to assess the adequacy of fit that relies on the individual\u2019s response to a test agent such as isoamyl acetate or irritant smoke near the wearer\u2019s nose while wearing the respirator.8 QLFT only measures the presence of leakage or not. QLFT may include bias such as differences in the wearer\u2019s sense of smell or uneven and immeasurable concentration of the test agents in the air.9, 10 QNFT is thought to be the more reliable method for fit testing, as reported in worldwide guidelines and research literature.11, 12, 13\n",

This is a standardised test performed by the wearer to detect gross leakage in a respirator. As suggested by some guidelines, no further QNFT is needed for a given respirator if leakage is detected by the user-seal-check.8, 14, 15 Furthermore, it has been suggested that a user-seal-check may be used as a substitute for QNFT if QNFT is not yet available. A previous retrospective study reported that the user-seal-check failed because its false-positive and false-negative rates in determining the fit of N95 respirators were too high.11 There were limitations to this study including the retrospective design, differences in the number of each given models being tested, staff being able to select the respirator for testing and no standardised procedures for donning the respirators. Variations in the donning technique may have affected the reliability of the reported results because the technique of donning has been shown to correlate with leakage.16, 17 These limitations restrict the reliability of the findings. Therefore, this topic warrants further investigation with a prospective study design.",

This was a PortaCount respirator fit tester system (Model Pro+ 8038, TSI Incorporated, St Paul, MN, USA). This system is based on a miniature, continuous-flow condensation nucleus counter (CNC) which is technology recognised by the OSHA to count air particles ranging from 0.02 to 1.00 \u03bcm in diameter.18 The use of the QNFT device followed the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines and the protocol described by the OSHA.8, 19 Once the wearer has donned the respirator and QNFT system in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines, the wearer performs eight exercises as recommended by the system. Figure 1\nshows the fit tester system, tubing connection and respirator. The eight exercises included normal breathing, deep breathing, side-to-side head movement, up-and-down head movement, talking (a standard set of passage was provided for reading), grimacing, bending over, and normal breathing. The grimace was to try and intentionally break the face seal to see if the respirator would reset itself afterward. Table I\nsummarises the exercises and their duration. Each exercise was given a particular individual fit factor (FF; range: 0\u2013200), except that of the grimace task. The overall FF was calculated using an equation in the protocol. This overall FF ranged from 0 to 200 and was the ratio of the concentration of a challenge agent outside the respirator to the concentration of the challenge agent that leaks inside the respirator (Cout/Cin). An FF of >100 indicates a \u2018pass\u2019 rating, which means a given respirator is a correct fit for the wearer.8, 19, 20 The PortaCount respirator fit tester system went through a daily check procedure in order to standardise the performance of machine and system.",
