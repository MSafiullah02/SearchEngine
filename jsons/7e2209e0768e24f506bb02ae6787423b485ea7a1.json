            "text": "Acute sinusitis is one of the leading diagnoses made in ambulatory medicine. The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) estimates that 20 million cases of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) occur each year [1] . The incidence of acute frontal sinusitis (AFS) specifically is considerably lower, less common than maxillary sinusitis in adults and ethmoid sinusitis in children. Medical therapies for acute sinusitis result in expenditures of $3.5 billion per year in the United States. Of all antibiotics prescribed in 2002, 9% of pediatric prescriptions and 18% of adult prescriptions were written for a diagnosis of acute sinusitis [1] .",

            "text": "Acute frontal sinusitis is most commonly preceded by a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Human rhinovirus is implicated in 50% of cases, but other viruses may include coronavirus, influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and enterovirus. The peak prevalence of these viruses occurs in early fall and spring, which parallels the peak incidence of ABRS. Viruses upregulate pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, as well as other inflammatory mediators such as histamine and bradykinin.Viruses also suppress neutrophil, macrophage, and lymphocyte function and can thereby inhibit the immune response [2] . The viral induction of the inflammatory cascade results in acute mucosal edema, occlusion of sinus ostia, and impaired mucociliary clearance. Mucus stasis can then favor the proliferation of pathogenic micro-organisms, resulting in acute bacterial sinusitis. Other risk factors for acute sinusitis include a variety of host factors: septal deviation, nasal polyposis, and immunodeficiency/immunosuppression, among others. While acute sinusitis typically affects the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses, progression of disease to involve the frontal sinus may be influenced by anatomic variations of the frontal sinus. The frontal sinus begins developing at age 3. Four frontal pits along the upper lateral wall of the embryological middle meatus differentiate into the anterior ethmoid cells. The second of these furrows evaginates from the anterior ethmoid region into the frontal bone, creating the frontal sinus [3] . Because the frontal sinus is embryologically derived from pneumatization of the ethmoid, frontal sinus outflow is thus influenced and defined by the degree of pneumatization of the ethmoid labyrinth. A variety of ethmoid-derived structures that comprise the frontal recess can thus narrow the outflow tract and predispose to acute frontal sinusitis. These structures may include agger nasi cells anteriorly, the bulla lamella posteriorly, supraorbital ethmoid cells laterally, and type I-IV frontal cells [3] .",

They also showed that after 2 weeks without antibiotic therapy, repeat CT scans showed improvement in 79% of 14 patients with these findings. Sinus aspiration studies have shown that significant bacterial growth occurs in approximately 60% of patients with URI symptoms lasting for 10 days or more [5] .

Anterior rhinoscopy and nasal endoscopy, however, can be useful adjunctive diagnostic tools. Examination of the nasal cavity may reveal mucosal edema, purulent discharge, or anatomic obstructions such as septal deviation or polyposis. Purulent secretions may be aspirated under endoscopic visualization and cultured to guide antimicrobial therapy. During aspiration and culture, the endoscope should be used to retract the nasal vestibule away to minimize contamination of the culture device by normal nasal vestibular flora.",

Macrolide-(18%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) (20%)-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae are also significant in the United States [9] . Thirty percent of H. influenzae and greater than 95% of M. catarrhalis cultured are B-lactamase-producing isolates [1] . Resistance patterns and prevalence differ by geographic region. Table 4 .1 shows differences in bacterial resistance by U.S. region [10] . The Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership recently published antibiotic recommendations for the treatment of mild to moderate ABRS. These recommendations are based on clinical efficacy and reflect drug resistance patterns. These recommendations are summarized in Table 4 .2 [1] . AFS should be treated with a minimum of 10 to 14 days of antibiotics when possible. If the patient's symptoms fail to resolve, the antibiotic course should be extended by 2 weeks [11] and consideration should be given to endoscopic exam and culture.",

Lumbar puncture may also be indicated to obtain CSF cultures and to rule out meningitis. Consultations with an ophthalmologist, neurosurgeon, neurologist, or infectious disease specialist should be considered. In contrast to uncomplicated AFS, radiologic studies play an important role in confirming and characterizing the extent of extrasinus infectious involvement. CT scan is the imaging modality of choice in evaluating intracranial or orbital complications of AFS. Studies should be performed with IV contrast in axial and coronal planes. With bone and soft tissue algorithms, CT scans can characterize bony erosions of the frontal sinus as well as phlegmons or fluid collections in adjacent orbital and intracranial soft tissue. Serial imaging studies should be considered in patients who appear clinically unresponsive to initial treatment. Intracerebral abscess is the most common intracranial complication of AFS. The frontal lobe is most frequently involved, although hematogenous seeding of distant brain structures may be observed less commonly [12] . Headache is the most common early symptom, although subsequently there may be a quiescent asymptomatic phase during which an abscess has coalesced [13] . Overall mortality reported in the literature ranges widely from 0% to 53% [13, 14] .",
