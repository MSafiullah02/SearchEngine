The lectin was adsorbed on all three ion exchangers, and it exhibited an N-terminal sequence identical to that of soybean lectin. Of all the sugars tested, melibiose most potently inhibited the hemagglutinating activity of the lectin, which was stable between pH 3\u221212 and 0\u221270 \u00baC. The lectin evoked maximal mitogenic response at about the same molar concentration as Con A. However, the response was much weaker. The soybean lectin inhibited the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase as well as the proliferation of breast cancer MCF7 cells and hepatoma HepG2 cells with an IC 50 of 2.82 \u00b5M, 2.6 \u00b5M and 4.1 \u00b5M, respectively. There was no antifungal activity. Another lectin was isolated from a different cultivar of soybean called little black soybean. The lectin was essentially similar to small glossy black soybean lectin except for a larger subunit molecular mass (31 kDa), a more potent mitogenic activity and lower thermostability. The results indicate that different cultivars of soybean produce lectins that are not identical in every aspect.",

They can be divided into groups, such as mannose-binding, glucose/mannose-binding, Nacetylglucosamine-binding, galactose-binding, Nacetylgalactosamine-binding, fucose-binding, and sialic acid-binding, according to their carbohydrate-binding specificity. Lectins have been isolated from a diversity of organisms including flowering plants [1] , animals [2, 3] , fungi [4] , and bacteria [5] . Many biological activities, including anti-proliferative, anti-tumor, immunopotentiating, anti-insect, antifungal, antiviral and antibacterial activities, have been found in lectins [6\u221211] . As a result, lectins have captured the attention of many investigators.",

After examining the hemagglutinating effect of fractions Q1\u22123, the lectin-enriched fraction Q1 was dialyzed against 10 mM NH 4 OAc buffer (pH 4.5) at 4 \u00baC, and then chromatographed on a 2.5 cm\u00d720 cm column of SP Sepharose (GE Healthcare), which had previously been equilibrated with and was then eluted with 10 mM NH 4 OAc buffer (pH 4.5). Unadsorbed proteins were eluted with the buffer, and then adsorbed proteins were eluted stepwise with the same buffer containing 0.2 M NaCl and 1 M NaCl, respectively. The fraction eluted with 0.2 M NaCl was then applied on a 1 ml Mono Q (GE Healthcare) column in 10 mM NH 4 HCO 3 buffer (pH 9). Following elution of unadsorbed materials, adsorbed proteins (fraction S1, S2 and S3), were desorbed with two NaCl concentration gradients (0\u22120.3 M and adsorbed proteins 0.3\u22121 M) in 10 mM NH 4 HCO 3 buffer (pH 9). The adsorbed fraction (S2), which was eluted by approximately 0.2 M NaCl, was the lectin-en-riched fraction. It was dialyzed, lyophilized and subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) using an AKTA Purifier (GE Healthcare) in 10 mM NH 4 HCO 3 buffer (pH 9.4). The first eluted absorbance peak constituted purified lectin. Molecular mass determination by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and by Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC)gel filtration SDS-PAGE was carried out in accordance with the procedure used by Nielsen and Reynolds [23] , using a 12% resolving gel and a 5% stacking gel. The gel was cast on the miniprotein Set II (Bio-Rad, Shanghai, China). Samples were diluted with sample loading buffer (10% glycerol, 0.4% SDS, 0.005% bromophenol blue and 20 mM EDTA in 0.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) followed by addition of 5% \u03b2mercaptoethanol. The samples were boiled in a water bath for 10 min. Electrophoresis was performed at a constant current of 10 mA at room temperature. At the end of electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. FPLC-gel filtration was carried out using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) that had been calibrated with molecular-mass standards (GE Healthcare).",

The assay for HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity was carried out in accordance with instructions supplied with the assay kit from Boehringer Mannheim (Berlin, Germany) since some antifungal proteins possess this activity. The assay takes advantage of the ability of reverse transcriptase to synthesize DNA, starting from the template/primer hybrid poly(A) oligo(dT)15. The digoxigenin-and biotin-labeled nucleotides in an optimized ratio are incorporated into one of the same DNA molecule, which is freshly synthesized by the reverse transcriptase (RT). The detection and quantification of synthesized DNA as a parameter for RT activity follows a Sandwich ELISA protocol. Biotin-labeled DNA binds to the surface of microtiter plate modules that have been pre-coated with streptavidin. In the next step, an antibody to digoxigenin, conjugated to peroxidase, binds to the digoxigenin-labeled DNA. In the final step, the peroxidase substrate is added. The peroxidase enzyme catalyzes the cleavage of the substrate, producing a colored reaction product. The absorbance of the sample at 405 nm can be determined using a microtiter plate reader and is directly correlated to the level of RT activity. A fixed amount (4\u2212 6 ng) of recombinant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase was used. The inhibitory activity of the lectin was calculated as percent inhibition as compared to a control without the lectin [27] .",

In this study, 1 \u00b5g of SmaIlinearized pBluescript SK was coated onto each well in the presence of 2 M NaCl as target DNA. The donor DNA was prepared by annealing VU5BR (5'-biotin-GTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCAGT-3') and VU5 (5'-ACTGCTAGAGATTTTCCACAC-3' ) in solution containing 10 mM Tris-HC1, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA and 0.1 M NaCl at 80 \u00baC followed by 30 min at room temperature.

After the integrase reaction, the biotinylated DNA immobilized on the wells was detected by incubation with streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim), followed by colorimetric detection with 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 10% diethanolamine buffer (pH 9.8) containing 0.5 mM MgCl 2 . The absorbance of each well due to the alkaline phosphatase reaction was measured at 415 nm.

Soybean lectin is galactose-specific [13] , whereas Chinese black soybean lectins are melibiose-specific although the latter two are also galactose-specific. The two Chinese black soybean lectins potently inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (IC 50 about 2.8 \u00b5M). It is known that some lectins exhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity and inhibit HIV replication [27, 29, 30] . However, just like the French bean defensin [28] , the two black soybean lectins are devoid of HIV-1 integrase inhibitory and SARS proteinase inhibitory activity. The antiproliferative and anti-tumor activities of lectins are well documented [25,27,31\u221233] . Chinese small glossy black soybean lectin exerts potent antiproliferative activity toward HepG2 and MCF7 cells, with an IC 50 of 4.1 \u00b5M and 2.6 \u00b5M, respectively. Both black soybean lectins manifest weaker mitogenic activity than Con A toward splenocytes. This is in line with findings on other lectins [24, 25] .",

Soybean lectin has immunomodulatory and anti-tumor actions [34] . Natural suppressor cells from the spleen and cyclophosphamide-generated suppressor cells react specifically with soybean lectin and can thus be isolated by agglutination from the bone marrow [35, 36] . Soybean lectin is employed for purging the marrow of T cells during treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in order to decrease the risk of graft-versus-host disease [37] ; soybean lectin reacts with and eliminates cancer cells from the marrow [38] . This investigation's findings on the two black soybean lectins' mitogenic activity towards splenocytes and their antiproliferative activity toward tumor cells are consistent with previous observations [34, 38] . An anti-tumor action mechanism of soybean lectins has been proposed involving the action of the lectins on tumor cell membranes, the reduction of tumor cell proliferation, the induction of tumor-specific cytotoxicity of macrophages, and apoptosis. Thus, tumor cells are more susceptible to attack by macrophages after treatment with lectins. Furthermore, lectins exert an immunomodulatory effect on altering interleukins production [39] .",

Thus lectins from the two cultivars of Chinese black soybean appear to differ in subunit molecular mass, thermostability and mitogenic activity, although they share the same N-terminal amino acid sequence and carbohydrate specificity and have similar HIV-reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity.

A. Chow (School of Medicine, UCLA). To express the protein, a 1-liter culture of E. coli BL21(DE3) cells containing the expression plasmid was grown at 37 \u00baC until OD 600 reached 0.7\u22120.8. Cells were induced by addition of 0.8 mM isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and harvested, after 4 h of incubation, by centrifugation at 6000 g for 10 min at 4 \u00baC. Cells were suspended at a concentration of 10 ml/g wet cell paste in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.1 mM EDTA, 2 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 M NaCl and 5 mM imidazole. Lysozyme was added to a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. After incubation at 4 \u00baC for 1 h, the lysate was sonicated and centrifuged at 40,000 g at 4 \u00baC for 20 min. The pellet was homogenized in 50 ml buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 M NaCl, 2 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol) containing 5 mM imidazole. The suspension was rotated at 4 \u00baC for 1 h, and cleared by centrifugation at 40,000 g at 4 \u00baC for 20 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a 1-ml chelating Sepharose (GE Healthcare) column charged with 50 mM imidazole. The column was washed with five column volumes of buffer A containing 5 mM imidazole, and the protein was eluted with three column volumes of buffer A containing 200 mM and 400 mM imidazole, respectively. Protein-containing fractions were pooled, and EDTA was added to a final concentration of 5 mM. The protein was dialyzed against buffer B (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl, 20% glycerol) containing 2 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and then against buffer B containing 1 mM dithiothreitol. Aliquots of the protein were stored at \u221270 \u00baC.",
