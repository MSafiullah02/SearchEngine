Darwin's insights increasingly underpin our attempts to understand human diseases, and the hygiene hypothesis is becoming a major component of 'Darwinian medicine' . This therefore is a good moment to wonder at an astonishing paradox: Google searches for 'Darwinian medicine' or 'evolutionary medicine' on 18 March 2009 revealed 22 200 and 32 100 hits, respectively. However, these terms did not exist in the MeSH database, so PUBMED searches yielded only a handful of papers. This might reflect a real failure of the medical establishment to value evolutionary medicine, and there is certainly a failure to recognize the 'hygiene hypothesis' as one of its most obvious and important components.",

A classical example was seen in the laboratory environment when a strain of Amoeba discoides became infected with a bacterium [2] . Initially this infection compromised the growth of both species, so it was not a case of mutualism. However, after 5 years neither organism could survive without the other. This indicates genetic changes leading to dependence. For instance, an enzyme that is encoded in the genome of both species might be dropped from the genome of one of them. Access to that gene is now 'entrusted' to the other species. This idea is at first somewhat alien to immunologists, but is in fact rather commonplace. For instance, most mammals can synthesize vitamin C, but large primates and guinea pigs have lost the relevant pathways. Man and guinea pig are now in a state of evolved dependence on fruit and vegetables; we had the genes in the past, but we do not any more. Perhaps the best example of evolved dependence is the mitochondrion. The mitochondrial genome is closest to that of the Rickettsiae, but has lost much genetic material.",

Since the start of agriculture and pastoralism about 10 000 years ago, human adaptation to new environments has been cultural and technological rather than genetic. (Interestingly, human genetic diversity appears to be increasing more rapidly than ever before, but this is due to the population explosion rather than to adaptation to specific environments [4] .) For example, we have not adapted genetically to living in cold places: we have learnt to make fur coats. Humans detect gene-environment misfit easily within the physical environment and invent appropriate technological adaptations. However, the immune system does not provide us with conscious awareness that it is receiving inadequate microbial stimuli, so we have been unaware of the problem and we have not sought solutions. Only since the hygiene hypothesis appeared have we been wondering if the immune systems of people living in clean modern cities are receiving appropriate inputs.",

The hunter-gatherer lifestyle was in fact many different lifestyles, in many different environments, so this is a complex issue, and the EEA concept is often criticized for this reason [5, 6] . Nevertheless one can identify types of organism that will inevitably have been abundant in all manifestations of the human EEA, but are diminished or absent from the modern city environment. 1 . An attempt to summarize those aspects of man's microbiological history that might be most relevant to the hygiene hypothesis. Epidemiological data, laboratory and animal models and preliminary clinical trials investigating the hygiene hypothesis implicate several of the organisms (top right of the figure, in bold type) that are thought to have accompanied mammalian and human evolution. This relationship was clearly long enough for the establishment of evolved dependence. Organisms that evolved during the Neolithic are less likely to be relevant in this context, and the first epidemiological transition did not reduce human contact with organisms associated with animals, faeces and mud that had been present during the Paleolithic. Conversely, the second epidemiological transition might have led to a gene-environment misfit, as the 'old friends' from the Paleolithic were removed progressively from the modern environment.",

In 1971 Omran coined the term 'epidemiological transition' to describe the major watersheds in human development that led to massive changes in mortality (reproduced and discussed in [7, 8] ). Paleolithic populations would have carried the organisms that they inherited from their primate ancestors ('heirloom' species). These included multiple helminths, and those viruses that probably co-evolved with man [herpesviruses, papovaviruses (papilloma), adenoviruses, parvoviruses, picornaviruses such as enetroviruses and hepatitis A virus (HAV), perhaps hepatitis B] [9, 10] and other important organisms (Helicobacter pylori, pinworm, Pneumocystis, Salmonella, Staphylococcus, and probably early forms of tuberculosis) [6, 8, 9, [11] [12] [13] . In addition they would have been exposed to zoonoses that they picked up as they scavenged carrion [6, 8] . Finally, they will have consumed several milligrams of harmless environmental saprophytes every day, as these are ubiquitous in soil and water. We have called these 'pseudocommensals' , because of their inevitable continuous presence until very recently. All these organisms must be good candidates for relevance to the hygiene hypothesis, because of their extremely long, inevitable, constant association with man, often in harmless carrier states. In sharp contrast, population density was too low for short-lived, dangerous, endemic infectious diseases that do not form carrier states.",

This will have had little effect on exposure to the 'pseudocommensals' or to the heirloom species. However, the more sedentary lifestyle increased orofaecal transmission and caused prolonged contact with animals. The latter led to adaptation to man of a number of animal viruses [caliciviruses, rotaviruses, coronaviruses, orthomyxoviruses (influenza B and C), paramyxoviruses (measles, mumps, parainfluenza, smallpox)]. Some of these, such as the caliciviruses and rotaviruses, might have already been present in early hominids, or at least encountered as sporadic or zoonotic infections, but the current human strains show close relationships to those of bovine and swine origin, suggesting further evolution in the Neolithic [9] . Indeed, large settled human communities provided a novel microbial habitat that led to a remarkable burst of microbial evolution [14] . In developing countries virtually all children are seropositive for rotavirus, which might therefore be relevant to the hygiene hypothesis. Other viruses probably acquired during the Neolithic such as influenza (B and C), smallpox, mumps and measles cannot have become endemic until populations were large enough. This required communities of several hundreds of thousands, which did not occur until the appearance of cities 2-3000 years ago. Because this represents only 100-150 generations, extremely strong selection pressure would have been required for evolved dependence to appear, and this seems unlikely. Moreover, most humans did not live in such large groups, and these viruses were, for example, absent from preColumbian American populations. At best, these infections might have eliminated some more susceptible genotypes. Sporadic, short-lived infections do not drive evolved dependence.",

For instance, doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), dsRNA or Chlamydia pneumoniae determine whether T helper type 2 (Th2) is increased or decreased [16] . Delayed infection can be crucial because it can occur after levels of antibody acquired from the mother have waned. For instance, HAV is harmless in small babies, but often fatal in the over-50s [10] . In the present context the important point is that the timing of virus infections is relevant to whether they enhance or inhibit type 1 diabetes [17, 18] . Similarly, the epidemiology of the recent rapid increase in childhood acute lymphatic leukaemia (ALL) is similar to that of type 1 diabetes and delayed infection with an unidentified organism is also a suggested mechanism in ALL [19] .",

One would also anticipate a reliable mode of transmission such as the orofaecal route, often accompanied by the ability to establish carrier states that facilitate such transmission. Finally, relevant organisms might be permanently resident commensals in the gut (as is now well established [20] ), or normal skin flora [21] (see below), or so abundant in the environment as to become 'pseudocommensals' , consumed regularly and inevitably in milligram quantities. The organisms with these properties are found in Fig. 1 in the list of organisms that accompanied man in the Paleolithic (top right).

The orofaecally transmitted organisms, implicated in recent epidemiological studies of the hygiene hypothesis, are particularly illuminating [15, [22] [23] [24] [25] . The genetic diversity in H. pylori decreases with geographic distance from East Africa, where modern humans evolved, and like humans, H. pylori seems to have spread from East Africa around 58 000 years ago [26] . Similarly, Salmonella is an ancient organism (~50 000 years), readily giving rise to carrier states [8, 11] . Enteroviruses and HAV are picornaviruses that, like most of this group, probably co-speciated with Old World apes and humans [9] . HAV is stable and resistant to inactivation by environmental conditions [10] , and its involvement in the hygiene hypothesis is explained in detail in this issue [15] . In developing countries the virus is ubiquitous, and babies are infected by the age of 3. Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite with a complex life cycle involving sexual replication in members of the cat family (Felidae) and asexual propagation in nearly all orders of placental mammals (except baleen whales and insectivorous bats), as well as marsupials and birds. However, cysts can transmit the infection to carnivores, omnivores and scavengers, without any need for the sexual phase in the Felidae. Thus transmission to man is likely to have been extremely common long before the Neolithic, although perhaps increased after the start of husbandry and the domestication of the cat [27] . Other protozoa not yet considered in this context, to my knowledge, include the very ancient Entamoeba, Giardia and Trichomonas, all of which have lost their mitochondria and have a close association with humans.",

A recent study indicated that manipulations of the immune system sometimes operate indirectly via changes to the microbiota. Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice develop spontaneous autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic b cells. This did not occur in NOD mice, in which the gene-encoding myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) had been inactivated, suggesting a direct role for MyD88 in T cell-mediated responses to b cells. However, this turned out to be an incorrect interpretation. Inactivation of MyD88 led to major changes in the gut microbiota, and this altered microbiota was responsible for the inhibition of the autoimmunity, which still occurred in MyD88 -/germ-free NOD mice [29] . If this is correct, much conventional gene knockout immunology might need to be re-interpreted. How many of the changed phenotypes seen have been secondary to changes in the microbiota? At the very least, this experiment emphasizes the very close relationship between the microbiota and the immune system, so gross changes caused by lifestyle, diet and antibiotics must be important. Some roles of the gut in immunoregulation are discussed elsewhere in this issue [30] .",

AOB can convert the high concentrations of urea and ammonia found in human sweat into nitrite and nitric oxide (NO). These molecules are absorbed rapidly and efficiently via the skin, so this source of nitrite will have been biologically significant [21] , and able to supplement the well-established blood-saliva-stomachblood cycle of nitrate/nitrite/NO. Feelisch believes that without AOB in the skin flora modern man is nitropenic ( [21] and M. Feelisch, personal communication).

Bacteria can also be seen in the glandular tissue of healthy breast, and in mononuclear cells in breast milk which, when 'sterile' , contains small numbers of cultivable organisms (<10 3 ). The mononuclear cells seem to be par-tially matured dendritic cells that might promote tolerogenic responses in the neonate [31] .

Many of these functions of inflammation are regulated by the transcription nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kB), and manipulating the activity of NF-kB has profound effects on tumorigenesis. Interestingly, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a -/or TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) -/mice are more resistant to chemically induced carcinogenesis.

Similarly, trials of a bacterial Treg-inducer are now planned for the type of depression that is accompanied by raised cytokine levels. Pritchard and colleagues in the United Kingdom have determined the maximum load of hookworm (Necator americanus) that can be tolerated without adverse effects [51] . A Phase 1 trial in allergic rhinoconjunctivitis has been completed [52] , and further studies are in progress in allergies, multiple sclerosis and IBD. Similarly, Trichuris suis has been tested in inflammatory bowel disease [53] , and is now entering trials in other disorders. Meanwhile, the exponents of probiotics are beginning to see that strains used for clinical trials in chronic inflammatory disorders need to be selected for their ability to induce immunoregulation. There is little point in trials of unsuitable strains imposed by companies that happen to hold intellectual property rights.",

How many functions or mechanisms relevant to setting up optimal balances within the immune system need to be triggered by microorganisms or their components? The striking effects of the polysaccharide from Bacteroides fragilis administered to germ-free mice [20] might suggest that a few critical molecules are involved, but this is speculation. 3. Is there significant redundancy and overlap in the roles of 'old friends'? The inconsistent results of epidemiological studies performed in different geographical regions could suggest that there is. The importance of a particular organism might depend upon what else is or is not present in the same environment. From an evolutionary point of view, redundancy is probable.",

I have tried to explore the underlying principles at the environmental and evolutionary level. The views expressed here help to explain the consistent failure of epidemiology that targets the identifiable, clinically apparent infections of childhood. Such studies fail to find any relevant associations with protection from allergic disorders [55] . The bias in these studies was dictated by hasty over-interpretation of the original findings of Strachan and colleagues [56] that had not undergone Darwinian scrutiny. Now we need to concentrate on organisms that have very long associations with the mammalian immune system, usually traceable back to the Paleolithic or earlier. Often these organisms will have been present as commensals, environmental 'pseudocommensals' , subclinical infections or asymptomatic carrier states. This type of reasoning can potentially sharpen the focus of future epidemiology, simplify the quest for clinical solutions to the problem posed by the increasing incidence of inflammatory disorders, and broaden the range of microorganisms going into clinical trials.",

Epidemiological data, laboratory and animal models and preliminary clinical trials investigating the hygiene hypothesis implicate several of the organisms (top right of the figure, in bold type) that are thought to have accompanied mammalian and human evolution. This relationship was clearly long enough for the establishment of evolved dependence. Organisms that evolved during the Neolithic are less likely to be relevant in this context, and the first epidemiological transition did not reduce human contact with organisms associated with animals, faeces and mud that had been present during the Paleolithic. Conversely, the second epidemiological transition might have led to a gene-environment misfit, as the 'old friends' from the Paleolithic were removed progressively from the modern environment.",

Obesity is associated with altered gut microbiota and excessive release of proinflammatory cytokines. Stress also alters gut microbiota and drives corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), which increases permeability of the gut mucosa. Increased absorption of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other microbial components drives further release of proinflammatory cytokines. Lack of vitamin D exacerbates immunodysregulation, as does the triggering of T helper type 17 (Th17) cells by dioxins. Meanwhile, the changes in the gut are also likely to impact on Th17 development. Raised levels of proinflammatory cytokines trigger depression in some individuals, and this feeds back into the CRH/gut circuits.",
