Rightfully, much of the attention to date has focused on the immediate needs of patients suffering from the disease, particularly those who are critically ill. The strain on healthcare systems and the need to control the virus using containment (testing and isolating cases) and mitigation (social distancing and shelter-in-place orders), has impacted the care of patients with other common medical disorders. Clinicians have been forced to balance the risk of delaying potentially necessary evaluation and management against the risks of exposing patients to the virus in hospital settings, or exposing health care workers to patients who may be asymptomatic carriers of the disease. This is further complicated by the re-allocation of resources, including personnel, to appropriately evaluate and treat patients with COVID-19.",

            "text": "Two related clinical situations that bring these issues into sharp focus are lung cancer screening and the evaluation and management of incidentally detected lung nodules. Current guidelines for lung cancer screening from CHEST (the American College of Chest Physicians), the United States Preventive Services Taskforce, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, recommend annual low-dose chest CT screening for high risk individuals, where the benefit of screening is felt to outweigh the harms. (1) (2) (3) Similarly, CHEST, the Fleischner Society, the British Thoracic Society, and the American College of Radiology have published guidelines with recommendations that balance the benefit and harms of evaluating incidental and screen detected lung nodules. (4) (5) (6) (7) The recommendations for small nodules are based on the size and attenuation characteristics of the nodule as well as the presence of lung cancer risk factors, while those for larger nodules are based on the estimated probability of malignancy (pCA) and the yield of additional testing. (4, 6) Clinical prediction models have been developed and validated to assess the pCA in nodules. These models can be used to help guide decisions about the selection and interpretation of additional diagnostic testing. (8) (9) (10) (11) Management decisions generally fall into three categories based on the estimated pCA of the nodule. For those in whom the pCA is low (defined as < 5%-15% in different guidelines)(4-7), surveillance imaging is recommended. When the pCA is intermediate (defined as 5-15% to 65-70% in different guidelines)(4-7), functional imaging (a positron emission tomography (PET) scan), and/or a non-surgical biopsy (bronchoscopy or transthoracic needle biopsy) is recommended. When the pCA is high (>65%-70% in different guidelines), direct referral for surgical resection is suggested if technically feasible and the patient is otherwise fit. (4,6) Although these recommendations appear straightforward, factors such as patient comorbidities and patient and provider preferences often influence the management strategy. (4, 6) The overarching goal of management is to avoid invasive procedures in patients who have benign nodules while expeditiously treating those that are malignant.",

There is added risk to the patient, other patients, and healthcare providers from exposure to the healthcare environment and the contact that occurs during testing. Recovery from surgical resection may be influenced by asymptomatic carriage of the virus. These added risks may upset the balance of benefit and harm struck by current (pre-COVID) guideline recommendations. There is also a shift in healthcare resources, towards cancelling elective procedures and imaging, in areas where COVID-19 is surging, or where systems are preparing for a surge, making it more difficult to adhere to available guidelines. These exposure risks and resource constraints have led the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to suggest that non-urgent care be deferred. (12) To date, clinicians and hospital systems have been independently determining how to modify their screening and nodule management programs during the pandemic. The purpose of this consensus statement is to provide expert opinion to clinicians regarding the performance of lung cancer screening and the management of patients with pulmonary nodules (detected either incidentally or by screening) in a manner that is consistent with current CDC COVID-19 guidance.",

A multidisciplinary panel of experts in lung cancer screening and pulmonary nodule evaluation was invited to participate. The usual CHEST conflict of interest review process for consensus statements was waived due to the rapid development of this statement and the nature of the content. All authors reported their potential conflicts as part of the publication process. The project leaders performed a search of current guidelines on the management of lung nodules. Recent guidelines relevant to the content of the scenarios were reviewed and a slide set summary was developed and distributed to panel members.(4-7) Tables 1 and 2, and Figure 1 reflect current (pre-COVID) guideline recommendations for the management of solid and sub-solid lung nodules, both incidentally and screen detected.",

Such nodules include solid nodules measuring <8 mm in average diameter, pure GGOs of any size, and part-solid nodules in which the solid component measures 6-8 mm in average diameter.

For such nodules with a pCA <25%, there was consensus that evaluation could be delayed for 3-6 months. In contrast, most panel members agreed that evaluation with PET or non-surgical biopsy should occur when the pCA is 25% to 85%, with subsequent referral for treatment when cancer is confirmed or more strongly suspected. Presumably, this will reduce the frequency of avoidable surgery for patients with benign nodules compared to a strategy that follows current (pre-COVID) guidelines (65-70% pCA threshold to consider proceeding directly to surgery) (4,6), at a time when hospital resources are being redirected to the care of patients with COVID-19. Based on a similar line of reasoning, there was consensus that patients with a very high pCA (>85%) do not require additional diagnostic testing and can proceed directly to a treatment decision, thereby minimizing pretreatment procedures that may pose a risk to the patient or members of the health care team (with the caveat that the patient should undergo appropriate staging and pretreatment physiological assessment in keeping with the principle of minimizing the use of invasive procedures and testing that generates aerosolized viral particles and that allows for judicious use of personal protective equipment).",

While many aspects of these scenarios have been reasonably defined in pre-COVID settings, the COVID pandemic introduces additional risks.

The voting reflects confidence among the expert panel that there is sufficient evidence that the risk of a delay in screening, in surveillance imaging, in avoidance of biopsy procedures or delaying management of an early cancer in the 12 scenarios is low, and an estimate that the risks related to COVID-19 posed by proceeding with pre-COVID recommendations are probably higher during the active phase of the pandemic. Given the limited information available to clinicians, we encourage providers and patients to consider guidance from this document and those of other professional societies. (14) The authors of this consensus statement recognize that our statements should not be interpreted as one-size fits all, and that what is appropriate now will change over time. Application of a general assessment to an individual patient requires the clinical judgment of the management team. In addition to considering patient factors and values, we have attempted to highlight that local factors, such as the prevalence of COVID in the community, the availability of rapid COVID testing, the adequacy of resources (personnel, imaging equipment, personal protective equipment), local policies, and the presence of other care delivery sites that are less impacted by COVID, should be considered when making individual decisions.",
