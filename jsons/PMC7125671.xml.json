            "text": "Since the pharmacological action of most drugs is promoted by a recognition process enabling a macromolecular target protein and a low molecular weight substrate to form a complex, the understanding of mutual drug-receptor recognition on an atomic scale is a key challenge in that field. Biological recognition is dominated by intermolecular interactions and it is generally accepted that not only steric but also complementary electronic properties of the involved species play a distinctive role in this process.1, 2 Whereas steric information can be provided by various methods, for example, by the determination of the molecular structure from a conventional X-ray diffraction experiment using the spherical independent atom model (IAM\n\u2020), electronic properties can be obtained from high-resolution X-ray data at low temperatures followed by an aspherical electron density modelling of the structure. For aspherical atom modelling, the Hansen and Coppens multipole formalism is commonly used that describes the asphericity of an atomic electron density by a sum of spherical harmonic density functions.3 In addition to intramolecular atomic and bonding properties, experimental electron density (ED) distributions contain information on weak intermolecular interactions in the crystal. For example, the electrostatic potential can be derived, being one of the most important properties in the study of molecular reactivity and the analysis of molecular association, which follows the so called principle of electrostatic complementarity.1, 4, 5, 6 ED properties in the crystal can serve in a first approximation as a model for the interactions under biological conditions, since the same types of effects as the ligand-target interactions should exist in this environment (e.g., steric, electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, van-der-Waals effects), and these are expected to be comparable in size.2, 7 In this respect, experimental ED properties are much better suited to simulate physiological conditions than those from theoretical gas phase calculations on isolated molecules.2\n",

To meet these demanding experimental conditions the appearance of CCD area detectors in the mid-1990s and the availability of an increasing number of highly intense synchrotron beamlines of the third generation have contributed substantially.9 Nevertheless, there still exist some limitations for a broad application of experimental ED work in the life sciences, where at least two major problems have to be addressed.(i)In medicinal chemistry, especially in drug development, it is common practise to screen over a large number of compounds to identify their potential activity. This makes also ED studies on series of molecules in short time periods necessary.(ii)Important biological molecules are macromolecules (proteins, polynucleotides), of which ED studies are known only in extremely rare cases.10, 11, 12, 13\n\n",

Following the transferability and additivity concept expressed in Bader\u2019s Qtaim theory,20 the data base entries are then applied to the building blocks of a given macromolecule to generate additively the ED of the entire molecule.",

In the examples detailed below, the accuracy of bonds in terms of rms deviations from ideality was reported in the range of some hundreds of \u00c5, which is about one order of magnitude larger than for small molecules, where bond length errors are generally smaller than 0.005 \u00c5.",

Moreover, the procedure provides an easy access to molecular surfaces and surfaces properties. Since recognition of interaction processes takes place via surface properties, their inspection is considered as a valuable source of information. Supported by corresponding graphical software developed in our lab (Moliso)26 we concentrate in this study on two types of surfaces:(i)The electrostatic potential (ESP), calculated in the XDPROP routine of XD24 after the method of Volkov et al.27 mapped as colour code on an ED iso-surface of 0.0067 e\u00c5\u22123 (corresponding to 0.001 au). For the consideration of the reactive behaviour of a chemical system, the three-dimensional distribution of its ESP is very helpful in that negative regions can be regarded as nucleophilic centers, whereas regions with positive electrostatic potential are potential electrophilic sites. Moreover, the electrostatic potential makes the polarization of the electron density visible.(ii)The Hirshfeld surface,28, 29, 30 which provides a computationally simple and elegant partitioning procedure for molecules in a crystal or another appropriate environment. It is defined by the ratio of the molecular density over the crystal density which should be a constant c, where c\n = 0.5 is normally chosen. We calculate the Hirshfeld surface according to this condition and map the non-spherical ED on this surface by a colour code. This allows the amount of density at a given site to be visualized. This way the Hirshfeld surface makes ED concentrations and hence sites and strengths of intermolecular interactions visible.\n",

To meet the two questions raised before (accuracy of the protein structure, choice of the substructure), this quality test was applied to the progesterone receptor as it provides the most complete packing around the substrate molecule. On the one hand, a random generator was used to \u2018jiggle\u2019 the atomic positions. This was done in two steps. First, the amount of displacement in atomic coordinates was chosen to be in the range of the experimental uncertainties of the protein structure. In a second step, the atomic displacements were chosen significantly beyond the experimental errors. On the other hand, the substructure was reduced to half of its size, carrying then 20 amino acids in the protein pocket. For the jiggled structure the multipole populations of the original combined assignment/refinement were applied. For the new smaller substructure, the above presented procedure (Fig. 1) was followed from its second step, which means, a DFT single point calculation was performed, followed by a calculation of theoretical structure factors and subsequent assignment/refinement of multipoles. For these modifications of the progesterone receptor substructures, reactive surfaces were generated and the topology of the intermolecular interactions was derived for the smaller substructure. The results are described in Section 3.4. and in parts in the Supplementary data.",

Whereas Figure 3 (above) shows only a moderate polarization of the isolated anilinoquinazoline gefitinib (2), the polarization increases considerably, if the substrate ESP is calculated in the environment of the pocket (Fig. 3 below). Moreover, we note that positively polarized regions dominate the substrate molecular surface. In accordance with these findings, the receptor pocket (Fig. 4) shows an ESP where negative regions dominate so that the principle of electrostatic complementarity is properly realized.

For the replication of this virus, its main cysteine protease Mpro (molecular mass 33.8 kDa per protomer) is essential since it releases the key proteins in viral replication. As a therapeutic approach towards anti-SARS drugs, the inhibition of Mpro by aziridine or epoxides was considered. The mechanism is displayed schematically in Figure 6\n. A nucleophilic attack from the cysteinic sulphur of Mpro takes place at a carbon atom of the epoxide inhibitor. This causes a ring opening and a covalent bond is formed between the cystein S\u03b3 and the attacked epoxide carbon atom, so that an irreversible inhibition of Mpro results.",

            "text": "One shortcoming should not be overlooked. It is the choice and accuracy of the medium molecular weighted substructure which should mimic the active site region. However, the considered examples have shown that even the quantitative analysis of hydrogen bonding in the chosen substructure systems follows the progression developed by Espinosa et al.47 on the basis of accurate small molecule crystal structures. Furthermore, the analysis of the additional model systems introduced for the progesterone receptor active site (see Section 3.4), the jiggled structure on the one hand and the smaller pocket on the other hand, reveal that the results presented in this study are stable to a high degree. The ESP is virtually identical for the original and the jiggle 0.05 \u00c5 pockets and only slightly different for the smaller 20 residue model. The latter one also shows minor changes in the Hirshfeld surface as well as in the topology of the hydrogen bonds (see Supplementary data). So we are confident that as long as fine details of the atomic structure are not considered, the surface properties are robust enough to provide reliable hints for the recognition and interaction of biomolecular species.",
