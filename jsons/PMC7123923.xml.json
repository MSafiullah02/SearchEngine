For some diseases this is the only information received on all cases. For other diseases, usually of more importance and with lower case numbers, an additional data collection form is initiated by the receiving health department, which gathers information as appropriate from the ill person, the treating physician, and health records. The optimum amount of information to collect in the initial case report, as opposed to the disease-specific case report form, is a matter of judgment and may change as technology changes. In a largely manual system, health departments typically desire to minimize barriers to reporting of cases, so the incentive is to keep the initial case report form short. If much of the information desired for the disease-specific case report form can in fact be extracted from an electronic medical record with no additional effort by the person making an electronic case report, then the balance changes. Careful decisions are needed: for which cases of which diseases are follow-up interviews necessary [5]?",

For example, it is becoming technically possible for likely cases of reportable diseases to be recognized automatically in health care electronic record systems. Some of these could be passed on to public health authorities without human review, in the same way that reportable laboratory results are already passed on in Electronic Laboratory Reporting (ELR). For which constellations of findings in the electronic health record would this be appropriate? Should some electronic case reports generated by electronic health record systems be passed to state or even federal public health officials before they are reviewed and validated at the local or state levels? If so, which ones? As always, there is a tension between the speed of information flow and its quality and completeness. There is a need for research to determine which constellations of findings in electronic health records have adequate specificity and sensitivity to warrant automated identification of a person as being likely to have a case of a reportable disease. The acceptable sensitivity and specificity will vary by disease.",

This document identifies a set of key attributes of surveillance systems to be assessed during a surveillance system evaluation, including simplicity, flexibility, data quality, acceptability, sensitivity, predictive value positive, representativeness, timeliness, and stability. These are also useful attributes to consider when designing a surveillance information system [9]. The relative importance of these attributes will vary depending on the condition under surveillance and the main purposes for surveillance. For example, a surveillance system to detect cases of botulism for immediate public health response puts a high premium on timeliness, and its operators are likely to be willing to accept a modest number of false-positive reports (a lower positive predictive value) in order to assure that reports are received very quickly. On the other hand, surveillance to support planning of cancer prevention programs and treatment services is less time-sensitive, given the quite long incubation periods for most cancers, and therefore more concerned with diagnostic accuracy of every case report than with speed of reporting. Timeliness, positive predictive value, and sensitivity of a public health surveillance system are always in tension with each other; increasing two of these always compromises the third.",

Sometimes this will be done best by automated messaging of structured data from one system to another, sometimes by supporting real-time look-up capabilities, and sometimes by development of a master person index to underlie some or all of these applications.

However, records received by the syndromic surveillance system should contain unique identifiers that could allow the epidemiologist analyzing the data to work back through the sending facility to an identified clinical record. This traceback might become necessary if the person appeared to have a case of a reportable disease or to be part of a significant outbreak.

Birth defect registries may also be built by active search for cases in hospital and other medical records, and abstraction of those records to make case reports. They also may be built by electronically linking records from vital statistics (birth and death records), centralized hospital discharge record systems, and clinical service providers for children with birth defects (such as state programs for children with special medical needs) [18].

While this collegial approach is very appealing, it may be unable to overcome significant barriers such as lack of laboratory funding or resources, and some facilities will supply data only in methods specifically required by law.The incentive approach \u2013 involves offering either financial or technical assistance to laboratory partners, assisting them in the startup process of ELR. While this approach may be preferred by many laboratories, relatively few jurisdictions have the discretionary funds (or are able to receive federal assistance funds) to implement the approach.The enforcement or legislative approach \u2013 requires reporting rules or legislation that requires laboratories to participate in ELR. The most successful enforcement approach will include low-cost options for smaller laboratories, such as web data entry, so that they may benefit from an ELR \u2013\u201clite\u201d implementation [32].\n",

For syphilis, contacts are people who have had sex with the original case. Contacts will be examined by a clinician and assessed serologically to see if they are already infected, and offered appropriate prophylactic or curative antibiotic treatment. For measles, contacts may include anyone who spent even a few minutes in the same room as a case. Contacts whose exposure was recent enough, and who are not fully immunized already, will receive a dose of measles-containing vaccine, and all contacts will be asked to self-isolate immediately if they develop symptoms of measles. In investigating a common-source outbreak of legionellosis, histoplasmosis, or anthrax, the local health department may want to locate everyone who had a specified exposure to the apparent source of the infection.
