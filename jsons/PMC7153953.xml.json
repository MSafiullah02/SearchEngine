            "text": "The rapid development in information and communication technologies (ICT) enhances teaching and learning experiences offered by higher education institutions (HEIs) (Stensaker et al. 2007). Because university sustainability depends upon the enrollment and retention of students, the effective integration of ICT plays a critical role in maintaining a competitive advantage. Previous research has discussed both the external and internal barriers that affect the process of technology integration, such as resources, training, and personal attitudes (Ertmer 1999; Nura et al. 2011). Research also advocates technology integration with pedagogical practices, rather than merely teaching certain technologies (Wang et al. 2014; Ambrose et al. 2010). While the examination of processes and outcomes of technology integration from faculty members\u2019 perspectives is critical, Stensaker et al. (2007) highlighted the importance of top-level administrator support for organization-wide technology integration initiatives. Professional development organizations are often the best equipped to implement technology initiatives. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence as to whether current professional development centers (PDCs) are providing optimal technology training initiatives for their faculty and students. This study articulates the PDC leaders\u2019 opinions about and their first-hand experiences in improving the technology integration process by addressing the following key research questions: First, how are information & communication technologies employed at flagship university professional development centers? Secondly, what are the barriers to implementing information and communication technologies at flagship universities?",

In this study, we use the term flagship university to address a more relevant model of leading national universities as advocated by Douglass (2016), Douglas and Hawkins (2016), and others (Yonezawa 2007; Gao 2015; Teferra 2016). The role of a flagship university is one that often meets world-class university standards as defined by the leading ranking systems. Flagship universities also include the top universities in a given economic zone, country, and or geographic region. In this regard, The University of the South Pacific is also a regional example as the leading university in 12 Pacific Island countries. While world-class universities are generally considered flagship universities, not all flagship universities meet the exclusive lists of top-ranked institutions.",

Many HEIs are utilizing technology as one of the key initiatives in their professional development programs. However, current literature indicates various purposes for and ways of using technology by different institutions. Studies show that technology integration strategies differ across disciplines and curricular domains (Eynon 2005; Hsu et al. 2013). For example, Eynon (2005) found that the most common use of technology within higher education institutions was to provide students with a range of online resources. She also examined other academic motivations, such as enhancing the educational experience for students; compensating the changes happening in higher education, such as the increasing student numbers and demand for flexible learning opportunities; and personal interests and enjoyment. In contrast, other studies have found that the majority of teachers still use technology passively as a \u201clearn-from\u201d medium (Wang et al. 2014; Siefert et al. 2019). Bigum (2002) described this passive adoption of technology practices as \u201cdomesticating\u201d the computer in classrooms. Prestridge (2010a) illustrated the practice as a \u201cre-tooling\u201d model that serves to strengthen teachers\u2019 approaches to implementing technology, but without changing their pedagogy.",

As Becker (1994) noted, the best educational purpose for using technology should be to promote student-centered learning. After examining eight world-class universities\u2019 faculty development centers, Jacob et al. (2015) concluded that instead of merely applying technology for its own sake, higher education institutions should implement technology to enhance teaching and learning endeavors. Further, Albion et al. (2015) argue that the integration of technology can be the educational innovation (as opposed to solely supporting or enhancing an existing endeavor). Some innovative pedagogical practices require teachers to implement technology to create an environment that supports learners\u2019 cognitive processes in problem-solving. These cognitive processes can provide learners a variety of critical, creative, and complex thinking opportunities (Wang et al. 2014). Ertmer and Ottenbreit-Leftwich\u2019s (2013) study suggested that the ultimate instructional and learning goal is to engage students in authentic problem-solving through the support of technology, rather than merely integrating technology into classrooms. Prestridge (2010b) concluded that ICT professional development should move from infrequent technology integration within a curriculum to a model that enables teachers to see the transforming potential of ICT, which is to integrate technology in promoting students\u2019 substantive cognitive learning and problem-solving competencies.",

The level at which teachers can accept technology in their teaching is described as \u201cteachers\u2019 digital literacy,\u201d which is a complex concept (Albion et al. 2015). Digital literacy includes teachers\u2019 broad views of the information era and consideration of constructing technology teaching models (Krumsvik 2008). The gap between research outcomes and technology usage in teaching is a result of the lack of transformation. This gap can also be described in terms of the relationship between research and practice or the complement between theoretical knowledge and experiential knowledge. For decades, there have been debates about the relationship between research and practice in education (Bereiter 2014). As a relatively new element of teaching, computer technology integration can be a driving force behind pedagogical innovation (Kozma and Vota 2014). Recent theoretical research and case studies suggest that the combination of research and practice is the optimal way to fill this gap between research outcomes and technology usage in teaching (Guri-Rosenblit 2002; Bereiter 2014). And although teachers are central to learning experiences, policymakers and center leaders should take responsibility for creating conditions that facilitate the transformation process and collaboration between faculties and technology researchers and experts (Kennisnet Foundation 2011).",

In contrast, internal barriers occur when the obstacles to adopting technology come from teachers and students themselves (e.g., personal beliefs, attitudes, commitment, skills).",

Nura et al. (2011) surveyed 312 higher education institution members of staff in Sokoto state, Nigeria, about their acceptance of the adoption of technology in human resource management.

Palak and Walls (2009) found that even in those schools with rich technology, teachers\u2019 strong traditional beliefs impeded the use of technology in teaching and learning. Therefore, examining teachers\u2019 inner drive to implement technology and how higher education institutions help to stimulate teachers\u2019 inner drive is crucial to implementing ICT in education. Little and Housand (2011) stated that support from school administration can ensure sufficient time and resources devoted to a professional development initiative. Albion et al.

Therefore, technology is often seen as the thing that can help to transform teaching practices. Most of the participants responded that using technology in their centers focuses on how to fulfill good educational principles. They used different technologies, instead of merely providing instruction about how to use a specific technology. As the PDC Director from Carnegie Mellon University responded:What we are always trying to do is find opportunities where technology can help solve a teaching or learning problem, or where technology can open a new opportunity to improve something that might not already be going on. So, we really look for technology not just for technology sake, but really\u2026in order to improve teaching and learning. And we really focus on the learning side, and thinking about that very deliberately. (ICT02\u201309)The Imperial College London Director also addressed how technology is used in his center:We offer some support in terms of the pedagogy of using e-learning and learning technology, and tools and technologies of that type related to learning. We don\u2019t train each staff or students in the mechanics of using functions provided by our IT Center, who do the training on technology. We just support the pedagogy. (ICT10\u201306)This training purpose is also addressed by the University of Pennsylvania Executive Director, as he described:The clear strength I think is that we are very good about thinking about the use of technology for the teaching end, and not getting caught up by thinking technology is an end to itself. I think that is a real positive. So we are able to help faculty and graduate students really think about what they are trying to accomplish in their teaching and then how to use technology to do that rather than start with what technology is out there and what you might use it for.

Thus, only teaching with new technologies is less meaningful to faculty members. Technology cannot be put before teaching and learning. Central PDCs should not only help faculty to integrate technologies; it is more important to inspire faculty members to think about ways to integrate technologies. To many PDC leaders, thinking about what learning objectives need to be achieved is more important than training faculty members in the use of new technologies. Therefore, technology is a tool that can enhance the teaching and learning experience. A prioritization of pedagogy serves the function of putting all these things together.",

Consultants ensure that faculty know how to apply technologies that are best connected with the educational conceptual perspectives. For example, as the Executive Director at the University of Pennsylvania explained: \u201cWe don\u2019t tell people the ways or the technical aspects of how to use a particular technology, but we will lead a discussion on how they might use it, not the technical side, but the pedagogical side of it\u201d (ICT07\u201306).",

You are teaching the large class, you want to have the opportunity to interact with your students, maybe use I-Clickers or Poll Everywhere, or Twitter.

Staff who master the use of technology, faculties\u2019 initiatives for technology, and researchers and experts who can bring more technical expertise to training are regarded as the three main aspects of implementing technology integration in faculty PDCs. Skilled staff members who have a broad knowledge of technology integration can facilitate better services for the faculty, as the Director of University of Pittsburgh mentioned in her interview.We have people who have a very broad knowledge of educational technology. So when you have staff and a place like this, you need to have people who are inquisitive and who have a certain level of intellectual curiosity and want to know\u2026. I think we have people who have solid skills that translate into better service toward faculty. (ICT01\u201307)The central focus of technology initiatives is to help meet the needs of faculty members and students. As the Director of the University of Pennsylvania said about the faculties\u2019 initiative for using technology, the responsibility of faculty PDCs is to assist faculty to apply technology according to requirements in their classes, instead of teaching them how to use technology.The clear strength I think is that we are very good about thinking about the use of technology for the teaching end. And not getting caught up in thinking about technology as an end unto itself. I think that is a real positive. So we are able to help faculty and graduate students really think about what are they trying to accomplish in their teaching and then how to use technology to do that, rather than start with what technology is out there and what you might use it for. So that is the strength. (ICT07\u201307)Also, as the Director of Imperial College London said about the faculties\u2019 initiative, the use of technology can be individuation, given that the nature of the technologies is diverse.The strength is the dispersed nature of the technologies, given that they are allowed to develop in a very organic way in the faculties. \u2026 Faculties are allowed to develop their own use of technology in e-learning as required and it is supplemented by centrally provided support and equipment and approaches. (ICT10\u201307)Experts and researchers are the third aspect of the implementation of ICT. However, as the Director of the University of Pennsylvania said, cooperation between experts and researchers can be a big problem when a lack of expertise exists in their center.But it also alludes to a weakness, which is that the technical expertise does not lie in our center, it lies elsewhere. So there are places where we might be more creative if we had greater technical expertise. But we don\u2019t have it and that becomes a weakness. If I had my druthers, it would be great to hire somebody whose area of specialization was in instructional technology, who could really bring the technical expertise that we don\u2019t have, but retain the pedagogical focus that we do have. (ICT07\u201307)Under-skilled and underprepared human resources, as indicated by many directors of PDCs, is a main external barrier to implementation of ICT. Skilled staff, faculty members, and ICT experts who work closely together are among the most effective at the case study institutions. Faculty members from the teaching side generate the need for using technology and provide feedback about current needs to both staff and experts. Based on their feedback, staff could provide timely help or a long-term improvement workshop. Also, experts can use their knowledge and research to facilitate all the services from a PDC.",

The Director of Oxford University mentioned that the class size in their university is much smaller than other universities and face-to-face teaching is very convenient, and technology integration seems not to be so important:I would say that because of the residential nature of our educational environment that technology has not been as important as it would be in other settings. We also have, with regard to students, we have very small class sizes compared to most other universities. So we simply don\u2019t have as much need for a lot of intervening technology. You will walk down the hall to go to lunch and you might bump into your students, it is a very much more personalized face-to-face teaching environment. Even a lecture might only have 20 students. So we have not relied that heavily on technology ... and we don\u2019t do a great deal of IT training in our office. (ICT05\u201308)The Director of the London School of Economics and Political Science said that their constraints are physical space limitations relative to their number of computer experts.I would say if I was looking at weaknesses I guess because of the nature of the disciplines we teach, there is no inherent drive to keep at the forefront of technology. We don\u2019t have computer scientists in the institution \u2026We have to introduce the latest \u2026 and encourage people to think about how they may or may not improve the quality of their interaction with students. I mean my other comment is that technology, for all its benefits, still fails to keep up with the ingenuity of human beings and providing their learning processes. So I would say technology still is not necessarily there, but we do what we can with it. (ICT06\u201307)An Associate Professor from the Centre for Innovation in Learning and Teaching (CILT) at the University of Cape Town described this barrier as \u201cinsufficient visibility\u201d. He said,The university associates the department more strongly with its technological expertise (a marketing and communication set of issues), but shortage of staff in particular areas (e.g. monitoring and evaluation, learning design, curation and IP). (ICT19\u201307)The Director at the Technical University of Munich pointed out another essential barrier in terms of the time conflict between research and teaching, which is also addressed by some other center leaders. He noted that people tend, especially when they are building their career, like in their thirty and forty. They tend to, you know, not focus too much on the teaching, just make sure the teaching goes long somehow. But where the merit comes from, that always the research side. And so, we, as a department of higher education, struggle a lot in making people giving their time to put effort into teaching. Because they say it doesn\u2019t count, in the end, it doesn\u2019t count. I won\u2019t get merit for it. I would get merit for another publication but not for in that teaching side.

Our study also indicated that faculty members usually are too busy to be involved in different kinds of technology training. These diverse formats and approaches are in essence providing more opportunities for faculty members to utilize technology in their teaching. Previous research has discussed technology as a tool that helps with learning. For example, Biancarosa and Griffiths (2012) examined how hardware (e.g. smartphones and laptops) and software (e.g. applications and programs) foster students\u2019 learning. However, the research seldom mentioned in detail the specific kinds of technologies that are widely used in current flagship universities - especially the software. We found that these prominent universities are primarily using Clickers, MOOCs, and Moodle across the world. Other higher education technology training centers may also consider using these globally-popular technologies to facilitate learning and engage students so that more learning resources can be accessed by and shared within different types of higher education institutions.",

Regardless of what resource restrictions exist, internal needs and motivations largely determine whether or not an institution develops optimal technology initiative.

Our research shows that human resources have been regarded as the most influential external factor. Specifically, skilled staff, motivated faculty members, and experts and researchers in technology are three main human resources factors. The role of research has been highly valued by faculty development centers. There is no doubt that most directors of centers believe that research could facilitate implementation of ICT in teaching and learning. Previous research indicates that the best practice for transformation is to combine teaching and research (Guri-Rosenblit 2002; Bereiter 2014). Our research shows that the major problem in transformation in flagship universities is a lack of experts in faculty PDCs. Some directors indicated that there were technology experts outside their centers. However, the problem comes from the collaboration between centers and experts. Many previous studies have indicated that faculty members can benefit from sharing knowledge (Leask and Younie 2013; Twining et al. 2013). We believe that collaboration should not be confined to bilateral collaboration. Instead, the whole process of collaboration should focus on specific needs in research, teaching, and learning (Hermans et al. 2008; Prestridge 2010b). Also, as Tondeur et al. (2010) discussed, leaders and ICT coordinators can generally play a critical role. The directors of PDCs should take the lead in facilitating the implementation of ICT and collaboration among faculty members, centers, and experts.",

Moreover, they are providing diverse formats of technology training, such as training a variety of participants, offering the latest instructional technologies, and conducting multiple training activities. These various forms of ICT training provide ample opportunities for faculty and students to enhance their teaching and learning experiences. The barriers to implementation of technology in such centers are diverse. The lack of available human capital resources\u2014including skilled staff, motived faculty, and experts in ICT integration\u2014and disruptive innovations and circumstances (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic) are key external barriers. Also, internal barriers driven by the needs of teachers, students, or institutions are important and need to be addressed in implementing technology integration in teaching and learning (Sang et al. 2010).",
