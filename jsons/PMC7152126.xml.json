Antiviral agents can be further classified into two general mechanisms. First\u2014and most numerous\u2014are nucleic acid analogues that inhibit viral DNA or RNA synthesis by competing with endogenous nucleic acids for incorporation into the viral genome by viral DNA polymerase or RNA transcriptases. The second mechanism is inhibition of the functions of other essential viral enzymes or proteins, including those responsible for attachment to or release from cells. For example, the principal antivirals for influenza viruses inhibit viral proteins responsible for either uncoating (M2 protein) or release and spread (neuraminidase).",
