In children, COVID-19 is usually asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. 2, 9 The majority of immunocompetent adult COVID-19 patients present with fever, respiratory symptoms, and radiological ground-glass lung opacities. 10 In severe cases especially among elderly and immunocompromised patients, besides respiratory failure, extrapulmonary manifestations such as diarrhoea, confusion, hepatic and renal dysfunction, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated inflammatory biomarkers have also been reported. 10 Small animal models that recapitulate the clinical and pathological features of COVID-19 in human are essential tools for studying the pathogenesis, transmission, antiviral treatments, and vaccines for this emerging global health threat. Based on the recent identification 6 of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the cell entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2, a transgenic human ACE2 mouse model was preliminarily reported. 11 However, the expression of human ACE2 in these transgenic mice is not physiological and these mice are not readily available. A rhesus macaque model was also reported, but expertise and Biosafety Level-3 facilities to handle non-human primates are scarce. 11 In this study, we established a readily available small animal model for COVID-19 using golden Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus). Our in silico structural analysis predicted that the hamster ACE2 can bind with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD) at high binding affinity. The clinical features, viral kinetics, histopathological changes, and immune responses in SARS-CoV-2infected Syrian hamsters closely mimic those described in many COVID-19 patients. Using this newly established model, we demonstrated the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 among close contact animals.",

Comparison of the 29 amino acid residues' alignment between human and other mammalian species revealed that the rhesus macaque ACE2 is 100% identical to human ACE2 at the interface region. Syrian hamster and common marmoset ACE2 proteins are also highly similar to human ACE2, each with 3-4 mutations at the interface. The Table   S2 ). Notably, SARS-CoV-2 spike exhibited higher binding affinity with ACE2 than did SARS-CoV spike. This might be attributed to the more compact interacting interface with more hydrogen bonds formed between SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein RBD and ACE2( Figure 1C To investigate the tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in Syrian hamsters, we performed viral load studies on the upper respiratory tract(nasal turbinate), lower respiratory tract (trachea and lung), extrapulmonary organs(intestine, salivary glands, heart, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, kidney, and brain), and blood harvested from virus-challenged animals at different time points which represented the early(2dpi), severe(4dpi), and start of recovery(7dpi) phases.

The disease progressed with increasing respiratory rate, decreasing activity, and progressive weight loss, and was most severe by 6dpi which is similar to the disease course of COVID-19 patients. 20 Histopathology showed progression from the initial phase of exudative inflammation to diffuse alveolar damage with haemorrhage and necrosis, and finally the proliferative phase after one week. Our findings were in agreement with the human autopsy findings except that our model also demonstrated extensive tissue apoptosis. 21 None of the challenged or contact hamsters died as <5% of human infections are lethal. 10 As for extrapulmonary manifestations, though diarrhoea is not clinically evident in challenged hamsters, histopathology showed intestinal mucosal inflammation, epithelial necrosis and viral N protein expression in enterocytes. This finding corroborates with the clinical manifestation of diarrhoea in only 2.0%-10.1% of COVID-19 patients despite that up to 53% of their stool samples are RT-PCR positive. 7, 22, 23 Myocardial degenerative changes were noted both in our infected hamster and patient autopsy despite the absence of viral antigen detection in the tissues, which is also consistent with the occasional report of heart failure in COVID-19 patients. 22 Lymphoid atrophy and apoptosis in spleen were observed which correlate with the frequent clinical finding of lymphopenia(83.2%). 10 The lymphoid necrosis is largely related to the marked activation of innate immune response in infected hamsters with high levels of fermenters that eat their own faeces, a feeding behaviour called coprophagy, to recover nutrients digested in the hind-gut but unabsorbed. 29 Thus, faecal-oral route of transmission could not be excluded in this model as well as in human.",

Moreover, hamster was demonstrated to be a good model for studying respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV, influenza virus, and adenovirus. 31,32 Unlike our hamster model for SARS-CoV-2, it is also notable that weight loss or intestinal involvement were absent in the hamster model infected by the 2003 SARS-CoV. 31 More importantly, the viral load in the nasal turbinate(7-log10TCID50/gram) of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters was consistently about ~1-log higher than that of their lung(~5.5-6-log10TCID50/gram) at 2dpi, 4dpi, and 7dpi, whereas the viral load in the nasal turbinate of the 2003 SARS-CoV-infected hamsters were generally similar or lower than 18 that of the lung. 31 This might help to explain why SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible as the upper respiratory tract involvement by the virus is no less than that of the lower respiratory tract, whereas SARS-CoV predominantly infects the lower respiratory tract.",

At 4dpi, epithelial cell desquamation with viral N protein expression and increased intra-epithelial and submucosal infiltration were observed.The trachea demonstrated epithelial cell swelling, focal cilia loss, and mononuclear cell infiltration into the epithelium and lamina propria at 2dpi(Figure3B). Desquamation of large12 areas of the epithelium mixed with infiltrating mononuclear cells and cell debris was observed. Viral N protein was abundantly expressed in detached epithelial cells. TUNEL staining indicated severe apoptosis. At 4dpi, viral N protein was only associated with detached cell debris.In the lungs, patches of focal inflammation and pleural invaginations were seen at 2dpi(Figure3C). Diffuse alveolar destruction, protein-rich fluid exudate, hyaline membrane formation, marked mononuclear cell infiltration, cell debris-filled bronchiolar lumen, and alveolar collapse with haemorrhage were observed. Viral N protein was abundantly expressed in bronchiolar epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages, and type I and II pneumocytes(Figure3D). TUNEL staining showed diffuse signals in the lung, bronchiolar lumen cell debris, and collapsed alveolar walls. At 4dpi, increasing lung consolidation and severe pulmonary haemorrhage were seen(Figure3E). Large syncytial bodies with multiple nuclei were seen in the epithelia of bronchioles and alveoli. Marked cellular proliferation with extensive expression of the proliferation marker Ki67 protein in both bronchiolar and alveolar cells was detected(Figure3F). More abundant viral N protein expression and TUNEL staining signals were found all over the alveolar wall(Figure3G). At 7dpi, in the nasal turbinate mucosa, the intra-epithelial and submucosal infiltration persisted, but viral N protein expression in the epithelial layer was much reduced and mainly located in the cell debris(Figure4A). Tracheal epithelium recovered to an intact layer with cell proliferation forming projections into the lumen with scarce viral N protein expression. Very marked increase in pulmonary cellularity with the peaking of lung consolidation was seen(Figure4B). The mononuclear cell infiltrate and fluid exudate were now largely replaced by massive pneumocyte proliferation with intensified Ki67 expression. The proliferative changes involved the epithelia of the trachea, small bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli. In the trachea and 13 small bronchi, the hyperplastic cells formed papillary projections into the lumen. The bronchioles and terminal bronchioles which are normally lined by simple cuboidal epithelium were replaced by multiple layers of irregularly arranged epithelial layers due to hyperplastic regeneration. Similarly, regenerative hyperplasia in the alveoli formed irregular-sized andshaped structures. During this proliferative phase, viral N protein was no longer easily detectable. At 14dpi, only mild pulmonary congestion and inflammatory infiltration were still detectable (Figure4C). The air exchange structures were remodelled and restored to normal. Histopathological changes in the extrapulmonary organ tissues Though low levels of viral RNA were detected in multiple extrapulmonary organ tissues by qRT-PCR, viral N protein was only detected in the intestine (Figure5A). At 2dpi, intestinal mucosal epithelial cells were intact. The lamina propria exhibited more mononuclear cell infiltration. The Peyer's patches were enlarged without forming germinal centres. Few mucosal epithelial cells and interstitial histiocytes were weakly positive for viral N protein. At 4dpi, severe epithelial cell necrosis, damaged and deformed intestinal villi, and increased lamina propria mononuclear cell infiltration were observed. A large number of intestinal epithelial enterocytes were positive for viral N protein. The spleen size was markedly reduced at 2dpi&4dpi. Histopathology showed depletion of white and red pulps with reduced number and size of follicles(Figure5B). TUNEL staining showed increased apoptosis at 2dpi&4dpi. At 14dpi, increased follicular size and lymphocytes in red pulp were observed(Supplementary FigureS3A). The bronchial lymph nodes and mesenteric lymph nodes showed subcapsular and medullary lymphatic sinus ectasia with pale eosinophilic lymph(Supplementary FigureS3B). Viral N protein was not detected, but TUNEL-positive cells were abundantly found. The heart showed mild focal myocardial 14 degeneration and interstitial oedema at 2dpi&4dpi(Supplementary FigureS3C), but viral N protein was not detected. No histopathological changes were observed in other organs. Chemokine/cytokine profile, neutralising antibody response, and passive immunisation In line with the viral replication kinetics, the chemokine/cytokine profile in the lungs of the SARS-CoV-2-infected animals also exhibited a time-dependent trend of gene expression with triggering at 2dpi, peaking at 4dpi, and resolving at 7dpi(Supplementary FigureS4). Interferon-\u03b3 was potently induced at 2dpi, implying that SARS-CoV-2 triggered the innate immune response mediated by natural killer cells and T cells. Consistent with interferon-\u03b3 induction, proinflammatory chemokines/cytokines were induced and peaked at 4dpi, which represented the potent activation of inflammation and virus-induced cell-death. At 7dpi, type II interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 dropped to the basal level and increased TGF-\u03b2 indicated the resolution of acute inflammation. Serum neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in challenged animals as early as 7dpi. The mean serum neutralising antibody titres at 7dpi&14dpi were \u22651:480 and \u22651:427 (1:160 to \u22651:640), respectively(Figure6A).

The upper and lower respiratory tract specimens of both the index virus-challenged and na\u00efve contact animals at 4 15 days after exposure were RT-PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA(Figure6C). The mean viral loads in the respiratory tract tissues of the challenged animals were not significantly different. Interestingly, the index animals exhibited significantly more weight loss(P<0.05) than the contact animals between 2dpi&8dpi(Figure6D). The histopathological changes and viral N protein expression in the contact animals' nasal turbinate, trachea, lung, and extrapulmonary tissues were similar to those of the challenged animals(Supplementary FigureS5). These findings confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 had spread by close contact from the challenged index animals to the na\u00efve contact animals. Importantly, all contact hamsters were infected in this transmission study. Sequencing of the surface spike gene from the index and contact animals showed no changes except for one contact hamster with a H655Y mutation(Figure6E).",

Cytokine storm was observed in severe COVID-19, SARS, MERS, and influenza in human. 24-27 The mounting of adaptive immune response as evident by increasing titre of neutralising antibody was associated with the control of the viral load. Passive immunisation with early convalescent serum SARS-CoV-2 resulted in significantly lower viral loads in the respiratory tract without apparent differences in clinical signs and histopathological changes. Further studies with serum samples containing higher neutralising antibody titres should reveal the possible benefit or immunopathology associated with convalescent plasma therapy. 28 Besides the satisfaction of the Koch's postulates by reproducing the clinical and pathological changes of pneumonia by virus challenge, recovery of pure virus from infected tissues, and detecting the rise of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralising antibody, we also demonstrated virus transmission by close contact between the challenged index hamsters to the na\u00efve contact hamsters housed in the same cages. It is notable that all five na\u00efve contact animals 17 in five individual cages were infected. The minimal amount of weight loss in the na\u00efve contact animals could be related to a lower virus inoculum when compared to the high single intranasal virus dose received by the challenged index animals. Though it was likely that the challenged animals were continuously shedding a high viral load in respiratory droplets which served as the most important portal of transmission, they might have also shed virus in their faeces as demonstrated by viral load study and N protein expression in the intestine.
