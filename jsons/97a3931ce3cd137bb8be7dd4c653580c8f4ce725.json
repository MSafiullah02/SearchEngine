It is believed to have initially infected animals and was subsequently transmitted to humans, thus, enabling human to human transmission [3] . Being an RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 has the inherent capacity of a high mutation rate that can make predicting the number of people infected as well as its future virulence virtually impossible. Beginning in December 2019 with infections in China, more and more countries have been affected, and on 30 January 2020, WHO declared this epidemic a 'Public Health Emergency of International Concern' [4] .",

(3) The identification and availability of isolated rooms, ideally with negative air pressure. Due to the risk of the dissemination of droplets, providers must favour physical barriers between patients. (4) An additional supply of PPE and the implementation of strict internal discipline, with different levels of protection according to the setting [18, 19] . (5) The development and implementation of cleaning protocols, considering that coronavirus has been isolated on inanimate objects, and healthcare workers were infected by SARS, even without direct contact with sick patients [15] . (6) Clinical management protocols must coordinate different services such as EMS, ICU, infectious disease, pulmonary, administrative and admission services.",
