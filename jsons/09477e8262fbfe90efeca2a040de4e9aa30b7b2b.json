In previous reviews on \"stories on antiviral drug discovery,\" I have reviewed various subjects in which I was personally involved. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] In this review, hopefully the first of a new series, I will address \"hot topics\" in areas of antiviral research in which over the past few years significant progress has been made requiring due attention. Most of the compounds covered are still in the preclinical stage. Compounds that have successfully completed phase II and III clinical trials and progressing to approval (or have already been approved) are not subject of this review. Instead, this article is based on compounds in the pipeline that offer attractive perspectives as future antiviral drugs. In this sense, the present survey is a little arbitrary in the selection of the topics, which depends at least in part on my own prejudices and a number of other factors, not at least my own acquaintance with the subject.",

Unfortunately, I could not attend the Conference, but guided by a certain devotion, I went through the Abstract Issue and spotted a number of interesting leads which I would like to reflect on in the present article: (i) nucleoside analogues, targeted at hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B RNA polymerase, such as PSI-352938; 6 (ii) cyclopropavir for the treatment of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections; 7 (iii) North-methanocarbathymidine (N-MCT) for the treatment of \u03b1-herpesvirus [herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2)] and \u03b3herpesvirus [Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection]; 8 (iv) CMX001 (1-O-hexadecyloxypropyl cidofovir) for the treatment of a broad variety of DNA virus infections; 9 (v) favipiravir (T-705) for the treatment of influenza virus infections and various other RNA virus infections; 10 (vi) the increasing number of compounds found effective against arenaviruses; 10, 11 (vii) new picornavirus (i.e., rhinovirus) inhibitors; 12, 13 (viii) natural products with antiviral activity such as aglycoristocetin derivatives 14 and tricin (4 ,5,7trihydroxy-3 ,5 -dimethoxyflavone); 15 (ix) mitogen extracellular kinase (MEK) inhibitors, such as U0126, acting at a cellular target, and effective against influenza and other viruses; 16 and (x) two unique sets of compounds which should be effective against virtually all enveloped DNA and RNA viruses. 17 Taken together, compounds (i) through (x) cover all major viral pathogens: polyoma-, adeno-, herpes-, pox-, picorna-, flavi-, arena-, myxo-, bunya-, and retroviruses, and particularly HSV, HCMV, hemorrhagic fever, influenza, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).",

            "text": "2 -Deoxy-2 -fluorocytidine (FdC) could be considered as the first nucleoside analogue ( Fig. 1) found to inhibit the hepatitis C virus (HCV) replicon in cell culture, its 5 -triphosphate inhibiting the NS5B polymerase. 18 Introduction of a methyl group at the C-2 position, as in \u03b2-D-2 -fluoro-2 -C-methylcytidine ( Fig. 1) , conferred a similar potency as FdC in the HCV replicon assay. 19 Although the 2 -C-methylcytidine (Fig. 1 ) demonstrated somewhat lesser activity against HCV than 2 -deoxy-2 -fluoro-2 -C-methylcytidine, 19 the prodrug of 2 -C-methylcytidine, its 3 -Ovaline ester, NM283 (valopicitabine) (Fig. 1 ) was developed (but later dropped) for phase II clinical trials. 20 Introduction of a 4 -azido group (Fig. 1) , as in R1479, 21, 22 RO-9187, RO-0622, 23 4 -azido-2 -deoxy-2 ,2 -difluorocytidine, and 4 -azido-2 -deoxy-2 -fluoroarabinocytidine significantly increased the potency in the HCV replicon system [i.e., with 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) values of 66 and 24 nM for the latter two compounds]. 24 The 2 ,3 ,5 -triisobutyrate ester prodrug of 4 -azido-2 -C-methylcytidine (RG1626) (Fig. 1 ) has been (but is no longer) in development as inhibitor of HCV, according to Reddy et al. 25 According to Reddy et al., 25 RG7128 ( Fig. 1) is currently in phase IIb clinical trials. RG7128 is the 3 ,5 -diisobutyrate ester prodrug of PSI-6130 (Fig. 1) ; in a 4-week combination study with the current standard of care (soc) for HCV infection (i.e., combination of pegylated interferon-\u03b1 and ribavirin), RG7128 demonstrated efficacy in genotype 1, 2, and 3 patients, and, therefore, represents the first direct acting antiviral to show pan-genotype HCV coverage in the clinic. PSI-6130 (\u03b2-D-2 -deoxy-2 -fluoro-2 -C-methylcytidine) is a potent inhibitor of HCV replication in the HCV replicon system [for an efficient, diastereoselective synthesis of PSI-6130, see Wang et al. 26 ]. To be active at the NS5B RNA polymerase level, PSI-6130 must be phosphorylated successively to its 5-mono-, di-, and triphosphate, the final, active metabolite which acts as a chain terminator of the NS5B RNA polymerase. 27 However, in addition to the 5 -triphosphate of PSI-6130, the 5 -triphosphate of its uridine counterpart, \u03b2-D-2 -deoxy-2fluoro-2 -C-methyluridine (RO2433) (Fig. 1) , is also formed, 28 and this second metabolite of PSI-6130 is also a potent inhibitor of the HSV NS5B RNA polymerase. 29 Deamination of PSI-6130 occurs at the 5 -monophosphate level. 29 RO2433 (Fig. 1) itself is inactive in the HCV replicon system, but its phosphoramidate prodrug PSI-7672 ( Fig. 1) is active in this system, where it is released as its 5 -monophosphate which can then be further phosphorylated intracellularly to the 5 -di-and 5 -triphosphate. 29 From R02433 (a uridine homolog, which was renamed PSI-6206), another phosphoramidate prodrug, PSI-7851 ( Fig. 1) was prepared, which proved to be pan-genotype inhibitor of HCV replication, with, however, lesser activity against the S282T replicon mutant (while the S96T/N142T mutation remained fully susceptible to PSI-7851). 30 Inside the cell, PSI-7851 is converted to the 5 -monophosphate of PSI-6206, and in this sense, PSI-7851 can be considered as a prodrug of PSI-7411. 31 PSI-7851 is, in fact, a mixture of two diastereoisomers, PSI-7976 (Rp diastereomer) and PSI-7977 (Sp diastereomer), the latter being the more active inhibitor of HCV RNA replication in the replicon system. 31, 32 PSI-7977 is currently being evaluated in phase II clinical trials. 33 From 2 -deoxy-2 -fluoro-2 -C-methylguanosine-5 -monophosphate a phosphoramidate prodrug was prepared, PSI-353661 ( Fig. 1 ), which proved highly active against genotypes 1a, 1b, and 2a HCV RNA replication in the replicon system, genotype 1a and 2a infectious virus production, and HCV replicons harboring the NS5B S282T or S96T/N142T mutations. 33 ",

This was further corroborated in subsequent studies. 50-52 N-MCT appeared to be phosphorylated to the mono-and diphosphate by the HSV-encoded thymidine kinase, and to inhibit the viral DNA polymerase through its triphosphate metabolite. 50 Kinases would prefer substrates that adopt the S sugar conformation, whereas cellular DNA polymerases almost exclusively incorporated the triphosphate of the locked N conformer, notwithstanding the presence of higher triphosphate levels of the S-conformer S-MCT ( r DE CLERCQ Antiviral activity against vaccinia virus was first shown with carbocyclic thymidine (Fig. 3 ). 54 N-MCT was found to be highly effective against orthopoxvirus infections in vivo (mice), 55, 56 although the lung, nasal, brain virus reductions it achieved for vaccinia virus infection (1HD strain) were not nearly to the same extent as for cidofovir. 57 Vaccinia virus lacking the F2L gene encoding functional deoxyuridine triphosphatase (dUTPase, that catalyzes the conversion of dUTP to dUMP) continued to replicate well in vitro and in vivo, but proved hypersensitive to the inhibitory effect of N-MCT. 58 As to its activity spectrum, N-MCT is not only active against the \u03b1-herpesviruses HSV-1, HSV-2, but also against the \u03b3 -herpesviruses EBV 55 and KSHV. 59 Apparently, N-MCT inhibits lytic KSHV DNA synthesis through its triphosphate metabolite produced in KSHV-infected cells expressing a virally encoded thymidine kinase. 59 Recently, a \"greener\" enantioselective synthesis of N-MCT from 2-deoxy-D-ribose has been reported 60 and a new MCT distinct from N-MCT, namely D-(+)-iso-MCT (Fig. 3) , has been described as a high-affinity substrate for HSV-1 thymidine kinase. 61 N-MCT shows potent anti-HIV activity in human osteosarcoma (HOS) cells modified so as to contain, and express, the HSV-1-encoded thymidine kinase. Possible anti-HIV activity of D-(+)-iso-MCT may have been masked by cytotoxicity. 61 N-MCT represents an interesting conformational concept. 62 Its therapeutic utility, however, remains to be demonstrated. As there are, at present, no therapeutic options for EBV and KSHV infections, these infections may well represent unique opportunities for the clinical potential of N-MCT to be further explored.",

The in vitro and in vivo activities of T-705 (6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide) were first reported in 2002 by Furuta et al. 95 The compound showed potent inhibitory activity against influenza A, B, and C viruses, some activity against picorna-and paramyxoviruses, but no activity whatsoever against DNA viruses. From its structure, it was immediately clear that the mode of action of T-705 had to be different from that of the M2 ion channel inhibitors amantadine and rimantadine, as well as that of the neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir and oseltamivir. This mechanism of action was further addressed by Furuta et al. 96 Within the cells, T-705 would be converted to T-705 ribofuranosyl monophosphate by a purine (adenine, hypoxanthine/guanine) phosphoribosyl transferase. Two phosphorylations would then generate T-705-4-ribofuranosyl-5 -triphosphate (T-705 RTP), the active metabolite of T-705. 96 That the latter is indeed the active metabolite of T-705 was also shown in cells infected with the highly pathogenic influenza A (H5N1) virus. 97, 98 Meanwhile, Sidwell et al. 99 had shown that T-705, when orally administered at dosages from 30 to 300 mg/kg (once or twice daily), prevented death due to a lethal avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection in mice. In vitro, favipiravir proved antivirally active against influenza A (H1N1) virus strains that were resistant to antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir, 100 and, in vivo, synergistic effects were obtained with favipiravir combined with oseltamivir against influenza A (H5N1) infection. 101 The carboxamide group present in favipiravir (T-705) is reminiscent of the carboxamide present in ribavirin. This carboxamide group is also present in T-1105 and T-1106, two compounds that are structurally related to T-705 (Fig. 5) . All the compounds share, with ribavirin, a broad-spectrum activity against various RNA viruses. Thus, T-1105 shows activity against foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and, as it can be administered through food, it could be a powerful tool to control foot-and-mouth disease in pigs. 102 T-1106 has proven efficacious against Yellow fever virus (YFV) in a hamster model of YFV infection 103 and is also active against bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), 102 another flavivirus that could be considered as a surrogate virus for hepatitis C virus (HCV).",

Yet, T-705 improved the disease parameters in YFV-infected hamsters, which may indicate its potential utility in the treatment of YFV infection in humans. 104 In rodents (mice or hamsters), orally administered T-705 is also effective against West Nile virus (WNV), 105 another flavivirus related to YFV. Whether T-705 or any of its analogues T-1105 or T-1106 would be effective against two other mosquito borne flaviviruses, dengue virus and Japanese encephalitis virus, remains an intriguing possibility worth exploring. Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV), an alphavirus belonging to the broad family of the flaviviridae, would seem to respond to T-705 treatment. 106 The antiviral activity spectrum of T-705 extends to arenaviruses: that is, Junin virus (JUNV), Pichinde virus, Tacaribe virus, Machupovirus (MACV), and Guanarito virus (GTOV) replication in cell culture could be inhibited by T-705, and as previously noted for its inhibitory effect on influenza virus, the antiarenavirus activity of T-705 could be reversed by the addition of purine, but not pyrimidine nucleosides. 107, 108 T-705 also proved efficacious against Pichinde virus infection in hamsters, even when treatment was begun after the animals fell ill, the day before the animals began to succumb to the disease. 109 Thus, for the treatment of late stage arenaviral hemorrhagic fever, T-705 could be considered as an alternative option to ribavirin. This would seem very important for severe arenavirus infections, such as Lassa fever, in humans.",

GP1 is involved in receptor binding, whereas GP2 is similar to the fusion proteins of other enveloped viruses such as retroviruses, paramyxoviruses, and filoviruses. A series of small molecules, including 17C8 (Fig. 6) have been identified to be targeted at the arenavirus GP. 127 These small molecule entry inhibitors (including ST-294 and interact with the envelope GPC of arenaviruses so as to stabilize the complex against pH-induced activation of membrane fusion in the endosome. 128 Both ST-294 and ST-193 (Fig. 6) inhibit the pHinduced dissociation of the receptor-binding GP1 subunit from GPC. ST-294 and ST-193 thus stabilize the GPC against pH-acidification which would otherwise initiate the fusion process. 129 The antiviral potency of ST-193 (Fig. 6) against Lassa virus and other arenavirus pseudotypes is within the range of 0.2-12 nM. The sensitivity to ST-193 is dictated by a segment of about 30 amino acids within the GP2 subunit. This region includes the carboxy-terminal region of the ectodomain of the transmembrane domain of the envelope protein. 130 The small molecule arenavirus inhibitor ST-193 was compared with ribavirin in a guinea pig model for Lassa virus infection, and found to increase the survival rate from 0% (control, ribavirin) to 62.5% .",

            "text": "Norsesquiterpenoids isolated from the roots of Phyllanthus emblica showed, again, some activity against Coxsackie B3 virus 156 and triterpenoids isolated from S. heptaphylla (Fig. 8) were accredited with broader activity against Coxsackie B3, influenza A, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and HSV-1. 157 Calycosin-7-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (Fig. 8) , the main isoflavonoid isolated from Astragalus membranaceus, also showed activity against Coxsackie B3 virus in vitro, and would improve the survival rate of mice infected with Coxsackie B3 virus. 158 Flavans 7-O-galloyltricetifavan and 7,4 -di-O-galloyltricetifavan isolated from the leaves of Pithecellobium clypearia would show activity against the same array of viruses (Coxsackie B3, influenza A, RSV, and HSV-1) as the triterpenoids mentioned above. 159 Homoisoflavonoids 3-benzyl-4-chromones (Fig. 8) showed activity against Coxsackie virus B1, B3, B4, A9, and echovirus 30, but not against poliovirus. 160 The flavone 4 ,5,7-trihydroxy-3 ,5 -dimethoxyflavone (tricin), isolated from the bamboo Sasa albo-marginata was found effective against HCMV at an EC 50 of 0.17 \u03bcg/mL which means a stronger antiviral activity than ganciclovir. 161 Tricin has also been accredited with antiinfluenza virus activity. 162 To increase the oral bioavailability of tricin, it has been conjugated with alanine-glutamic acid. The prodrug of tricin (tricin-alanine-glutamic acid) showed excellent oral bioavailability upon oral administration in rats. 163 The isoflavone genistein (Fig. 8 ) was originally isolated from fermentation broth of Pseudomonas sp. 164 and initially described as a tyrosine-specific protein kinase inhibitor. 165 Only recently, genistein has been shown to inhibit arenavirus infection, 166 putatively by inhibiting arenavirus entry which occurs through a cholesterol-dependent clathrin-mediated endocytic mechanism. 167 Raoulic acid (Fig. 8) is the principal ingredient of Raoulia australis. It was shown to inhibit picornaviruses, that is, rhinovirus 2 (HRV2), rhinovirus 3 (HRV3), Coxsackie B3, Coxsackie B4, and enterovirus 71 at EC 50 values in the range of 0.1-0.4 \u03bcg/mL, that is, at lower concentrations than those at which the aforementioned triterpenoids and flavans showed antiviral activity. 169 However, raoulic acid did not show activity against influenza A or B. 169 Terameprocol is a methylated derivative of nordihydroguaiaretic acid, a phenolic antioxidant extracted from the creosote bush Larrea tridentate. 170 Terameprocol (Fig. 8) has been found to inhibit the growth of poxviruses, that is, cowpox and vaccinia, by preventing the spread of virus particles from cell to cell. 170 Nigericin (also known as antibiotic K-178, helexin C, azalomycin M, antibiotic X-464, and polyetherin A) has also been shown to inhibit poxvirus replication. 171 It had been previously reported to inhibit poliovirus and influenza virus replication. 172, 173 Aglycoristocetin derivatives with a cyclobutenedione carrying hydrophobic chains such as methylene bis(phenylene) (Fig. 8) inhibit influenza A and B virus infections, probably by interference with the viral entry process. 174 These types of compounds (derivatives of glycopeptide antibiotics) have been previously shown to inhibit the replication of retroand coronaviruses and this inhibitory effect was also attributed to interference with virus entry. 175, 176 Brassinosteroids, that is (22S,23S)-3\u03b2-bromo-5\u03b1,22,23-trihydroxy stigmastan-6-one (Fig. 8) , represent naturally occurring polyhydroxy steroidal plant hormones modulating the growth and differentiation of plant cells. Their antiviral activity has been well documented. 177, 178 Brassinosteroids are particularly active against arenaviruses such as Tacaribe, Pichinde, and Junin. 179 Biyouyanagins A and B were originally obtained from Hypericum chinense and shown to be active against HIV. 180 These compounds possessing antiarenavirus and anti-HIV properties have been recently obtained by total synthesis, and their originally assigned structures were revised (Fig. 8) . 181 In conclusion, a wealth of natural products has been reported to possess antiviral properties. In the majority of these cases the chemical structure was well identified but the full antiviral activity spectrum of the compounds still needs to be evaluated, their mode of action elucidated, and, most importantly, their therapeutic value delineated.",

Signaling through the mitogenic cascade seems to be essential for influenza virus production. 189 The Raf, MEK, and ERK pathway not only plays an important role in the replication of influenza A and B virus, but also in the replication of HIV, 190, 191 Coxsackie virus B3, 192 coronavirus, 193 and HSV. 194 MEK inhibitors such as U0126 should therefore impair the propagation of these viruses, as has been specifically shown for U0126 against HSV-2 194 and X4 HIV-1. 191 The Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade is activated upon infection with Borna disease virus (BDV), a noncytolytic highly neurotropic single-stranded RNA virus, the only known member of the Bornaviridae (Mononegavirales) and, again, the MEK inhibitor U0126 was found to block spread of BDV in cultures cells. 195 The pathogenesis of hemorrhages in dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)/dengue shock syndrome (DSS) is poorly understood. The hemorrhages may be related to the induction of the plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) via activation of the MEK/ERK pathway, the MEK inhibitor U0126 almost completely suppressed PAI-1 expression, 196 and may therefore be assumed to suppress hemorrhages in DHF/DSS.",

Through the MAPK signaling pathway, sorafenib may also interfere with the replication of HCMV. 200 Imatinib may suppress HCMV replication through inactivation of the platelet-derived growth factor-\u03b1 receptor (PDGFR), which is a critical receptor required for HCMV infection. 201 Various protein kinase inhibitors containing a quinazoline moiety such as gefitinib (Iressa R , AstraZeneca and Teva) exert anti-HCMV activity in vitro and in vivo (gefitinib also inhibits the HCMV kinase UL97). 202 Furthermore, HCMV replication depends on the MEK/ERK pathway, and could therefore be suppressed by MEK inhibitors such as PD 98059. 203 In conclusion, MEK inhibitors may exhibit a broad-spectrum activity against a multitude of viruses, including influenza, herpes simplex, HIV and other retroviruses, dengue, corona, and HCMV. Although the antiviral effects could not be considered as highly specific, the advantage of MEK inhibitors, in view of their action targeted at a cellular process, is that they are unlikely to lead to the (rapid) emergence of drug resistance.",

They both possess a rigid and planar hydrophobic moiety. With their hydrophobic moiety, LJ-001 and dUY11 would intercalate into the lipid bilayer of the viral envelope, thereby affecting the virus-cell fusion process. Both LJ-001 and dUY11 should, in principle, be active against all enveloped viruses. For two important human pathogens, HCV and HSV (-1 and -2), this activity was demonstrated, but for several others (i.e., yellow fever, dengue, Japanese encephalitis), this was not. In fact, the compounds should be compared side by side for their spectrum of activity. Admittedly, they should not easily lead to drug resistance development, but other issues should be further addressed, that is, in vivo activity and selectivity, biodistribution, drug formulation, r DE CLERCQ and pharmacodynamics, before their therapeutic value could be assessed. LJ-001 and dUY11 herald a new approach or strategy to combat enveloped virus infections, but the question can be raised whether they are druggable as well.",
