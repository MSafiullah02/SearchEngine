Ebola Like other filoviruses, Ebola virus has the special thread-like structure seen on electronic micrographs. Ebola virion contains a linear, single-stranded negative-sense RNA genome, which is approximately 19,000 nucleotides in length without a polyadenylated 3\u2032 terminus or a 5\u2032 capped end. The genome encodes seven structural proteins and one non-structural protein ordered 3\u2032-leader-nucleoprotein (NP)-viral protein VP35-VP40-glycoprotein (GP)/secreted GP (sGP)-VP30-VP24-RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L)-trailer-5\u2032. The leader and trailer are non-transcribed regions but are important signals that control the transcription, replication and packaging of the viral genomes into new virions. Glycoprotein (GP) is the main viral determinant of Ebola virus pathogenicity.",

This restriction may be because Ebola virus disease kills infectors at a high mortality rate and governments and individuals always respond quickly to quarantine these areas. The natural reservoir(s) and primary transmission route(s) of Ebola virus disease are not entirely clear. It is reported that bats could be a possible reservoir, and they may support the replication of Ebola virus without symptoms of the disease. Ebola virus disease is believed to occur after an Ebola virus is transmitted to a human via contact with an infected animal. Human-to-human transmission appears to occur through direct contact with blood or other body fluids from infected patients or by contact with contaminated medical equipment, so barrier nursing is necessary to limit the spread of infection. A report from Natural News confirmed that Ebola can be transmitted through aerosols and that the virus can survive for days outside a host (http://www.naturalnews.com).",

Haemorrhagic manifestations arise during the peak of the illness. The liver, kidney, and spleen are damaged by the Ebola virus, leading to serious bleeding and coagulation abnormalities, including gastrointestinal bleeding and a range of hematological irregularities, such as lymphopenia and neutrophilia. When the virus attacks reticuloendothelial cells, cytokines are over produced and cause an exaggerated inflammatory response that is not protective. The microvascular endothelial cells are eventually infected by the Ebola virus, and the vascular integrity is destroyed. The terminal stages of Ebola virus infection usually include diffuse bleeding, and hypotensive shock accounts for many Ebola virus fatalities.",

Favipiravir can be converted to T-705-ribofuranosyl-50triphosphate, a nucleotide analog that can inhibit the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or induce lethal mutagenesis by incorporating into the viral RNA [2] . BCX-4430, a new nucleotide analogues, inhibits virus replication by inhibiting viral RNA polymerase function. It exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity against numerous viruses, including flaviviruses, bunyaviruses, and coronaviruses [3] . The serum of recovered patients may also be useful to develop a treatment for Ebola virus disease. During this outbreak of Ebola virus in the West African countries, two Americans became infected, and they benefited from a cocktail antibody treatment, called ZMapp, which is a mixture of three humanized mouse monoclonal antibodies (c13C6, h-13F6, and c6D8). The three anti-Ebola virus monoclonal antibodies had significantly protected rhesus macaques from a lethal challenge of Ebola virus [4] ; however, no human safety studies were performed before the drug was administered to these two patients. The FDA has approved ZMapp for the treatment of patients infected with Ebola virus in the current emergency situation. The antisense technology can also be used to treat Ebola virus disease. Warren et al. [5] reported that small interfering RNAs and phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers may effectively prevent Ebola virus disease in nonhuman primates by targeting the Zaire Ebola virus RNA polymerase L protein.",

            "text": "The common, broad-spectrum, antiviral drug Ribavirin might only be effective among moderately ill patients, similar to Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF). Ribavirin is a synthesized guanosine analog that may inhibit RNAdependent RNA polymerase, mutagenize the genome and inhibit inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), which is a key enzyme for de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis [9] . In addition to anti-viral treatments, we could also consider medicines that provide vascular protection. Rutin, or vitamin P, is a major flavonoid that can be used in CCHF and epidemic hemorrhagic fever to protect vascular barrier integrity. Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), including selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), play critical roles in cell adhesion to the vascular endothelium resulting in extravasation of cells and vascular inflammation. Rutin can inhibit the expression of CAMs, thus inhibiting the adhesion and migration of leukocytes and affecting vascular barrier integrity [10, 11] . Vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, can also be used in CCHF and epidemic hemorrhagic fever [11] . It may prevent the endothelial dysfunction via stimulating endothelial proliferation, modulating blood flow by sparing endothelial cell-derived nitric oxide and increasing the level of type IV collagen in the basement membrane [12] . High-dose methylprednisolone also effectively treats patients with CCHF [13] . Activation of NF-\uf06bB could upregulate the proinflammatory cytokines followed by endothelial cell dysfunction. Research showed that blockade of NF-\uf06bB activation preserved endothelial barrier integrity. Patel et al. [14] reported that statins had the role of anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory by downregulating expression levels of NF-\uf06bB, sCD40L and sICAM. In addition, it can also decrease expression of tissue factor and thrombin and increase activation of thrombomodulin [15] . Currently, statins have been used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, which could be considered for treating patients with EHF.",
