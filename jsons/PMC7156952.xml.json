The most striking finding in our patient was the collapsing FSGS. This finding suggests that FSGS could account for the heavy proteinuria reported in a significant proportion of patients with COVID-191. The collapsing FSGS is a known complication of other viral infections, in particular the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)4, but also the cytomegalovirus5 and the parvovirus B196. For HIV a direct toxic viral effect on podocytes has been documented7. The receptor for SARS-CoV-2, membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is expressed on podocytes8\n,\n9. PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was negative in kidney biopsy samples, but the technique has a notoriously low rate of detection in non-respiratory samples (including blood and urine)10 and the quality of the extracted RNA material was poor. However, in our patient\u2019s case, the presence of viral particles in the podocytes, revealed by electron microscopy study, strongly suggests a direct toxic viral effect on podocytes.",
