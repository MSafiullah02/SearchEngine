            "text": "The past decade has seen the advancement of human genetics and genomics worldwide. Various countries have invested seriously in this field, with the expectation of gaining a better understanding of human health and disease. Biobanks and genetic databases have been built to facilitate interdisciplinary clinical research. Regional and international efforts have also been made to promote the success of genomic medicine. For example, in Europe, the Biobanking and Biomolecular Resources Research Infrastructure has been constructed to secure global competitiveness of research and industry of the European Union, and benefit the health of European citizens. International genomic research collaborations, such as the Human Genome Project (HGP), the International HapMap Project, and the International Cancer Genome Consortium, have produced open-access genetic databases for researchers around the globe (Kaye, 2011; Vaught et al., 2009). The completion of the sequencing of the human genome, the mathematical analysis of DNA variants called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and the progress in genome-wide association studies have contributed dramatically to biomedical research. Yet the majority of medical genomics research has mainly focused on people of European descent, the results of which will not be beneficial to the greatest segment of the world's population. Given that the lack of diversity in these studies will bias our understanding of the association between genetic variants and diseases, researchers have recognized the importance of inclusion of populational diversity in pharmacogenomic and genome-wide disease studies (Bustamante et al., 2011).",

Asian nations, particularly those still developing, are often depicted as the epicenter of pandemics, e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza outbreaks (Tan et al., 2012). At the same time, these countries also face growing chronic disease burdens, but the causes of diseases in Asian populations remain unknown (Jemal et al., 2011). Thus, genomic research on Asian populations is essential to further enhance our knowledge of the genetic basis of complex chronic and infectious diseases, and to cope with Asian and global public health challenges. In this article, we first give a brief introduction to the contributions of Asian nations to human genomics, placing greater focus on the genomics consortiums and initiatives in the region: Asian Cohort Consortium (ACC), Human Genome Organization (HUGO) Pan-Asia SNP consortium (PASNP 1.0) and HUGO Pan-Asia Population Genomics Initiative (PASNP 2.0). We then discuss the challenges that Asia faces in bringing genomic science and technology to bear on applications of genomic medicine. Finally, we outline several future perspectives for the advancement of genomics in Asia.",

The ACC has two missions: \u201c(i) to serve as a platform for cross-cohort collaborative projects and combined analysis and (ii) to act as an incubator for new cohorts\u201d (Song et al., 2012). The ACC has approximately 50 active members from Bangladesh, China, India, Iran, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and the United States, among others. It is cochaired by John Potter of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA, and Daehee Kang of Seoul National University College of Medicine, South Korea.

Research into the ELSI of genomics was initiated first in the USA, thence spreading to Canada and Europe (Zwart and Nelis, 2009). Awareness of the issues in the East happened much later, but such research was supposed to study similar issues as those in the West for the purpose of some outcomes leading to better regulation of genomics. More recently, Yoshizawa et al. identified heterogeneous regulatory frameworks and ELSI practice among EA countries. They found that EA countries' regulation of genomics had a relatively inconsistent and mixed character. Consider the aspect of privacy as an example: Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan have regulations and oversights to protect personal information, while China and Indonesia exert little or no control over privacy issues. A similar situation is seen with ethics review. Even though there are ethics review committees in nearly all of these countries, discrepancies in ethics review capacities and the implementation of oversight between different countries are noticeable (Yoshizawa et al., 2014).",

This stance was supported by Malaysia, Thailand, and other developing countries to communicate their desire for mutual trust, transparency, and equity between the developed and developing nations in the virus sharing mechanism. Moreover, Indonesia revised its health law and enacted the Ministry of Health Regulation on Material Transfer Agreement in 2009 in order to safeguard national sovereignty over its biological materials (Sedyaningsih et al., 2008). Although India has ethical guidelines and regulations in place to prevent biopiracy, there is a lack of adherence to regulations and an absence of strict implementation of measures to monitor the misuse of genetic samples (Kumar, 2009). China faces similar problems. To protect the use of Chinese genetic resources in research collaboration, the Office of Legislative Affairs of the State Council, People's Republic of China, published the exposure draft of Measures for the Administration of Human Genetic Resources online in 2012 to solicit advice from the public.

The biopiracy issue reflects complexities in cross-border collaboration as well as the importance of mutual trust and equity among scientists in using human genetics.",

Increasingly, there is also a trend toward collaboration among developing countries (south\u2013south collaborations) in building human resource capacity (Ivers et al., 2010). In the case of the PASNP consortium, Edison Liu, one of the key organizers of the consortium, found it challenging to coordinate science collaboration among Asian scientists. As he pointed out:Scientists in Asia have a tendency to look past each other and focus on collaborations with the United States or Europe, partly because these collaborations get them more credit from their school administrations. Also, in Asia, most countries see each other as competitors. Just getting people together is an accomplishment.Liu, 2008\n",

Another challenge rests with the disparity in research capacities and research infrastructures between Asian countries (Liu, 2008). Besides these challenges, Asian genomic research collaborations face similar challenges as those of the international science communities more generally. As large-scale genomic research collaborations require data comparisons and validations across different populations, the lack of harmonized ELSI and lack of a regulatory infrastructure for genomic research and application are major hurdles. It is also difficult but crucial to ensure the quality of samples and the interoperability of data for collaboration (Song et al., 2012; Vaught et al., 2009). Finally, the translation of genomics knowledge to genomic medicine and innovative medicine products necessitates the interaction and collaboration of all stakeholders. They are not only scientists, clinicians, policy-makers, and industry people, but also patients, consumers, and healthy individuals.",

These factors include the public's understanding of biobanks, its trust in research institutions and the scientists running those institutions, and its consideration of privacy, discrimination, and commercialization (Gottweis et al., 2011). In Asia, there is tendency for the public to distrust science. For example, Singapore's growing emphasis on commercialization of science discourages the public's participation in research. In Japan, public trust in expertise was eroded following the earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear accident in 2011 (Arimoto and Sato, 2012). There are cases reporting public distrust of experts, and public concerns over the misuse of genetic information and genetic discrimination after genetic testing in China and South Korea. In Taiwan, tensions and distrust arose between the public and authorities of the Taiwan Biobank due to a lack of open science communication (Yoshizawa et al., 2014). Well-known cases of scientific fraud in South Korea (Bonetta, 2006), Japan (Tsurimoto et al., 2009), and China (Lin, 2013) have also contributed to the lack of trust between the public and scientists. All of these signal a call for an interface of science and society to actively interact with the public.",

Building regional collaborative genomics networks, such as ACC and PASNP 1.0 and 2.0, is the first and vital step toward better science, medicine, and health in Asia. The research conducted by these networks is competitive in the global arena and bridges the gaps between Asia and Western countries. However, compared with research collaboration in Europe and North America, Asian genomics networks face more challenges than their counterparts in the West. The emerging economies and the developing countries in Asia have not established consistent and robust regulatory frameworks to govern the conduct of genomic research. Furthermore, their ELSI practice and regulation is often influenced by local sociopolitical and cultural concerns and tends to be heterogeneous. This has been a disincentive to regional collaboration on genomic science and technology, which requires the harmonization of ELSI practice and regulation across Asia. Therefore, in the future, it will be helpful to place more emphasis on research into ELSI of genomics and develop regulatory infrastructures, which could become a tool to secure the public's trust in science. It is also important to encourage both north\u2013south collaborations and south\u2013south collaborations. Experience gained from PASNP could contribute to further collaboration on the basis of previous networks and research collaboration.",
