DRUG -ELUTING STENTS -instent restenosis is due to fibrosis of coronary vasculature and usually happens 3 months postprocedure. Drug-eluting stents (sirolimus, paclitaxel, everolimus, or zotarolimus) are designed to inhibit cell proliferation and decrease the risk of in-stent restenosis. There has been some controversy regarding higher adverse events in patients with first generation drug-eluting stents (sirolimus or paclitaxel). The most recent outcomes research analysis suggests that newer-generation drug-eluting stents (everolimus or zotarolimus) are associated with a decreased rate of repeat revascularization, stent thrombosis, and no significant difference in mortality \u00b7 BENEFITS -primary PCI is generally preferred given the superior outcomes compared to fibrinolysis, particularly if (1) For patients with an estimated GFR of 15-60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , a threshold of 201 pg/mL can be used APPROAC H -\"the features evaluated in more than one study with the highest LRs (>3.5) for diagnosing heart failure were the following: the overall clinical judgment, history of heart failure, S3, jugular venous distension, pulmonary venous congestion or interstitial edema on CXR, and atrial fibrillation on ECG. The features evaluated in more than one study with the lowest LRs (<0.60) for diagnosing of heart failure were the following: the overall clinical judgment, no prior history of heart failure, no dyspnea on exertion, the absence of rales, and the absence of radiographic pulmonary venous congestion, or cardiomegaly. The single finding that decreased the likelihood of heart failure the most was a BNP <100 pg/mL. While the findings of this study are useful when assessing dyspneic patients suspected of having heart failure, no individual feature is sufficiently powerful in isolation to rule heart failure in or out. Therefore, an overall clinical impression based on all available information is best. If the appropriate constellation of findings with high LRs for heart failure are present, that may be sufficient to warrant empirical treatment without further urgent investigations\" ",

When measured, serum level should be collected at 12-24 h after the last dose (postdistribution phase). While the upper normal limit is 2.6 nmol/L [2.0 ng/mL], higher digoxin levels may be seen in asymptomatic patients. Low-dose digoxin, resulting in serum levels 0.5-0.9 nmol/L [0.4-0.7 ng/mL] is associated with possible survival benefit compared to \u22651 nmol/L [\u22650.78 ng/ mL] in HF patients MECHANISM -digitalis acts by inhibiting the membrane-bound Na/K ATPase transport system. This leads to intracellular loss of K and gain of Na. Increase in intracellular Ca leads to \u2191 cardiac contractility. Digoxin also exerts a vagotonic action, which slows conduction through the SA and AV node and helps to control heart rate PRECIPITANTS OF DI G OXIN TOXICITY -toxicity is not merely related to serum levels, but also digoxin dosing (e.g., acute overdose), other medications (e.g., non-potassium sparing diuretics), and conditions (e.g., renal insufficiency, acute coronary syndromes, cardiac amyloidosis, hypothyroidism). For instance, hypokalemia, hypernatremia, hypomagnesemia and acidosis predispose to toxicity even at low-serum digoxin levels because of their depressive effects on the Na/K ATPase pump. In contrast, hyperkalemia occurs in acute toxicity and is directly related to prognosis",

In view of the high specificity, the presence of a systolic bruit (in particular a systolic-diastolic bruit) in a hypertensive patient is suggestive of renovascular hypertension.
