Our results show (i) that power-law growth is observed for all countries; (ii) by using the distance correlation, that the power-law curves between countries are statistically highly correlated, suggesting the universality of such curves around the World; and (iii) that soft quarantine strategies are inefficient to flatten the growth curves. Furthermore, we present a model and strategies which allow the government to reach the flattening of the power-law curves. We found that, besides the social distance of individuals, of well known relevance, the strategy of identifying and isolating infected individuals in a large daily rate, can help to flatten the power-laws. These are essentially the strategies used in the Republic of Korea. The high correlation between the power-law curves of different countries strongly indicate that the government containment measures can be applied with success around the whole World. These measures must be scathing and applied as soon as possible.",

One of the most remarkable characteristics of COVID-19 is its high infectivity, resulting in a global pandemic. In this complex scenario, tasks like protect the people from the infection and the global economy may be considered two of the greater challenges nowadays. In order to improve our knowledge about the COVID-19 and its behavior in different countries over the World, we exhaustively explore the real time-series of cumulative number of the confirmed infected cases by the COVID-19 in the last months until March 27 th , 2020. In our analysis we considered countries of Asia, Europe, North and South America. Our main findings clearly show the existence of a well established power-law growth and a strong correlation between power-law curves obtained for different countries. These two observations strongly suggest an universal behavior of such curves around the World. To improve our analysis, we use a model with six autonomous ordinary differential equations, based on the well-known SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) epidemic model (considering quarantine procedures) to propose efficient strategies which allow the government to increase the flattening of the power-law curves. Additionally, we also show that soft measures of quarantine are inefficient to flatten the growths curves.",

Usually, for values R 0 < 1, the number of new infected individuals decreases exponentially. For 1 < R 0 < \u221e this number increases exponentially [2, 3] . However, nature is full of surprises and there are plenty of cases for which the exponential behavior is substituted by power-law [4] and are related to branching processes with diverging reproductive number [2] , scale free networks and small worlds [5] . It was already suggested in the literature that the COVID-19 growth might be a small world [6] . This is in agreement with recent results [7] suggesting that for many countries around the World the COVID-19 growth has the tendency to follow the power-law.",

Authors found exponents around \u00b5 = 2.1 \u00b1 0.3, which do not vary very much for different provinces in China. This suggests that socio-economical differences, local geography, differences in containment strategies, and heterogeneities essentially affect the value of the exponent \u00b5, but not the qualitative behavior. A model of coupled differential equations, which includes quarantine and isolations effects, was used by the authors to match real data. Power-law growths for China were obtained also in another study and a possible relation to fractal kinetics and graph theory is discussed [9] . In line to the above last week publications, the present work analyzes the time-series evolution of the COVID-19 for the following countries: Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Spain, and United States of America (USA). In all cases we observe a powerlaw increase for the positive detected individuals, where the exponent \u00b5 changes for different countries. In addition to the power-law behavior we also computed the Distance Correlation (DC) [10] between pairs of countries. The DC is able to detect nonlinear correlations between data [11, 12] . We show that power-law data are highly correlated between all analyzed countries. This strongly suggest that government strategies to flatten the powerlaw growth, valid for one country, can be successfully applied to other countries and continents. Furthermore, a model of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) is proposed and some strategies to flatten the power-law curves are discussed using the numerical simulations.",

The exponent \u00b5 changes for distinct countries and the complete fitting parameters are given in Table I . Results in Table I are presented in decreasing order of the exponent \u00b5. USA [ Fig. 1(a) ] has by far the largest exponent and therefore became already the country with epidemic records. Even though Germany [ Fig. 1(b) ] reported a small number of deaths, it has the second large exponent, followed by Spain [ Fig. 1 Republic of Korea the power-laws are more clear due to the number of available data. For these two countries a flatten is observed after the power-law. The jump observed after 30 days in China data are due to a change in the counting procedure of infected cases (see the situation report on February 17 th , 2020, in Ref. [13] ). Republic of Korea, on the other hand, focused on identifying infected patients immediately and isolating them to interrupt transmission [14] . It is interesting to note that for Japan, another country that adopted similar measures, we obtained a similar value for \u00b5. The most desired behavior is that the exponent \u00b5 becomes smaller leading to a flattening of the curves. But this is apparently not that easy. Besides USA and Ger-many, which have a distinct inclination in the beginning of their power-laws, and China and Republic of Korea, which are stabilizing the epidemic spread, for all other infected.

To quantify the relation between the power-law growth we use the DC, which is a statistical measure of dependence between random vectors [10, [15] [16] [17] [18] . Please do not confuse the word distance with the geographical distance between the analyzed countries. The most relevant characteristics of DC is that it will be zero if and only if the data are independent and equal to one for maximal correlation between data. Details about the definition of DC are given in Appendix A. Figure 2 presents specific results for the DC calculated between some selected countries, namely Brazil, Italy, Japan, and USA. Italy were chosen due to their relevance in Europe, relevance regarding to typical data of the virus. USA was chosen for being nowadays the top affected country and Brazil and Japan representing distinct continents and distinct epidemic containment measures. Thus, we compute the DC between four continents. Figures 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), 2(g), 2(h), and 2(i) are the cumulative number of confirmed cases in each country, as in Fig. 1 , but considering data since the first day the infections were reported. In these curves we clearly see the initial plateaus due to the incubation time. After the plateaus, a qualitative change to a power-law growth (the same from Fig. 1 ) occurs. The time for which the qualitative change occurs is distinct for each country.",

Even though USA has the largest exponent and Japan the lowest one (considering the error in Table I ), they are highly correlated.

As a consequence, the red curves are in full agreement with the data in this time interval.

We are aware that such asymptotic behavior can be hardly trusted with numerical simulation of models. However, our intention in displaying such asymptotic behavior is to show that the proposed model converges to reasonable values. Now we discuss results for some emblematic scenarios for the model when specific strategies are applied to Italy and France on day March 28 th . For both countries we assume \u03ba s = 1 for all strategies, which means that all symptomatic individuals per day are putted into quarantine. We can see that the strategy represented by the orange curves is not sufficient to reduce significantly the total number of confirmed infected individuals for France, since the last value \u03b8 ef f = 1.90 indicates a large level of social interaction in this country. On the other hand, for Italy a considerable reduction is observed, specially for the orange-dashed curve, which indicates only the number of symptomatic cases. Strategies related to the blue curves mitigate the growth of the number of confirmed cases and, with exception of the dark blue case for Italy, lead to smaller asymptotic values when compared to the red curves and orange scenarios. The light curves, related to large social distance (\u03b8 = 0.8), are the most efficient scenarios to induce an accentuated reduction of the growth and a fast convergence to the maximal number of confirmed cases. Furthermore, green curves tend to approach the medium blue curves, which means that, for \u03b8 = 1.0, there is no significant difference between isolating 1% (\u03ba a = 0.01) of the asymptomatic individuals per day or doing nothing. However, increasing the daily ratio of detection and isolation of asymptomatic individuals to \u03ba a = 0.05, a noticeable reduction of the asymptotic value of infected individuals is observed (see magenta-dashed curves). Nevertheless, none of these strategies are better than increasing the social distance, scenario represented by the light blue curves. Blue curves: are still related to the reduction of social interaction so that \u03b8 can take the values \u03b8 = 2.0, 1.5 and 1.0, going from dark blue to light blue. Green curves: reduction of social interaction together with tests to identify and isolate asymptomatic and mild symptomatic cases. Here we use \u03b8 = 2.0 and \u03ba a = 0.20. Magenta curves: reduction of social interaction together with tests to identify and isolate asymptomatic and mild symptomatic cases. Here we use \u03b8 = 1.5 and \u03ba a = 0.15. Orange curves: reduction of social interaction together with tests to identify and isolate asymptomatic and mild symptomatic cases. Here we use \u03b8 = 1.0 and \u03ba a = 0.10. For the dashed curves, the parameters are the same as those from the continuous curves above, but represent the total number of confirmed symptomatic individuals. We notice that asymptomatic individuals, or those with very light symptoms, would not be identified without realization of tests and are not computed in the number of confirmed cases.",

In the case for which the strategy does not change (\u03b8 = \u03b8 ef f and \u03ba s = \u03ba ef f s ), the red curves increase very much for both countries. Very high asymptotic values of infected individuals are reached, 3.4 \u00d7 10 7 cases for Brazil and 5.9 \u00d7 10 7 cases for USA. Now we discuss results when new government strategies are applied to Brazil and USA on March 28 th . All blue curves (dark to light) tend to mitigate the growth of the asymptotic number of cases for both countries. However, values of \u03b8 = 2.0 and 1.5 still lead to large asymptotic values. The case with \u03b8 = 1.0 is the most relevant strategy to flatten the curve efficiently. From the strategies which combine social distance with quarantine for the asymptomatic and mild symptomatic cases, stands out the inefficiency of the scenario with \u03b8 = 2.0 and \u03ba a = 0.20 to flatten the green curve. On the other hand, strategies with larger social distance (magenta and orange curves) lead to more promising scenarios. The better prediction emerges when using \u03b8 = 1.0 and \u03ba a = 0.10 (orange curves). For comparison, if we consider only the symptomatic cases, we obtain the asymptotic values 3.0 \u00d7 10 4 (light blue curve) and 1.6 \u00d7 10 4 (orange-dashed curve) for Brazil and 8.7 \u00d7 10 5 (light blue curve) and 4.6 \u00d7 10 5 (orange-dashed curve) for USA. As in the case of France and Italy, also for Brazil and USA we observe that the social distance is the key element to reduce the growth rate of the maximum of symptomatic cases.",

Distinct power-law exponents for the countries are found and summarized in Table I . The power-law behavior suggests that the underlying propagation dynamics of the virus around the countries follows scale free networks, fractal kinetics and small world features [5, 6, 9] . While power-laws with distinct exponents may look similar visually, it is necessary to quantify this similarity. For this we compute the Distance Correlation [10] [11] [12] between all countries mentioned above (not shown). However, using representative countries of four continents, namely Brazil, Italy, Japan, and USA, results for the DC are presented in Fig. 2 . They show that the power-law growth between these countries are highly correlated, even between north and south hemispheres. The high correlation between the power-law curves of different continents strongly suggest that government strategies can be applied with success around the whole World.",

We apply numerically distinct strategies to flatten (or not) the power-law curves. Even though the social isolation, a well know benefit, is very powerful to flatten the curves, we found other strategies which lead to comparable results. For Italy and France, for example, the best scenario was obtained when reducing the social interaction to \u03b8 = 0.8 (light blue curves). However, if 5% of the asymptomatic and mild symptomatic individuals are identified and isolated every day (\u03ba a = 0.05), asymptotic values of the same order of magnitude for the symptomatic cases were obtained even if \u03b8 = 1.0 (magenta-dashed curve). On the other hand, for Brazil and USA, our simulations confirm that to keep the social distance is essential to decrease the asymptotic number of infected individuals, and even better results could be obtained by increasing the tests to identify and isolate asymptomatic and mild symptomatic individuals (compare light blue and orange curves). The above combination between social interaction and the huge degree of isolation of infected individuals could be implemented to prevent economic catastrophes because people are not working. In other words, let some essential individuals go back to work (increasing \u03b8) and, simultaneously, increase by a huge amount the number of daily tests and isolation of infected individuals. This could furnish an efficient scenario to flatten the power-law.",

(B.5), the factor T serial dividing Q represents a rate of exit from the quarantine (for the group R). It is of most relevance to mention that the only adjustable parameters in our simulations are \u03b8 and \u03ba s . This is important since for systems composed of differential equations with r parameters, 2r +1 experiments are need to obtain all the information that is potentially available about the parameters [28] . Since in our case r = 2, we need 5 real data to adjusted parameters correctly. All real data used in Figs. 3 and 4 to find \u03b8 ef f and \u03ba ef f s are larger than 5. Furthermore, the initial condition for the variable E(t 0 ) is adjusted only in the first part of the data, where the first \u03b8 ef f and \u03ba ef f s are determined along the data. It could be thought that such initial condition must be include in the adjustable parameters. However, even in such case, r = 3 and 2r + 1 = 7. The lowest number of available data in the first part of data is 9, as can be seen in Fig. 3(b) , meaning that even in the worst case our adjustments are trustful. The goal is to minimize the mean square error between the predicted curve and real data. In the case analyzed here, \u03ba a = 0 along the real data. It is only changed, not adjusted, when there are information available about the test realization in the population. We do not start the parameter's adjustment from the first day of reported infections, but later on. The model produces better results in such cases.",
