            "text": "Bay leaf (Laurus nobilis) (Fig. 5.1\n) is an evergreen perennial shrub that belongs to the laurel family (Lauraceae). It has been used for 1000 years, and it is an essential ingredient in cooking and in many traditional practices (Parthasarathy et al., 2008). The genus Laurus has a range of 24,00 to 25,00 species, and their varieties are native to the Southern Mediterranean region, the subtropics and tropics of Eastern Asia, South and North America, the Balkans, and Asia Minor. The great variability among species is largely attributed to the uncertainty in the exact number of species. Due to the morphology, flower color, growth habitat, leaves, stems, and chemical composition, variability is found. Two laurel species are traditionally found: Laurus azorica and L. nobilis. There are number of plants outside the genus Laurus with the common name bay laurel, including bay rum tree, or simply bay (Pimenta racemosa) (Akg\u00fcl et al., 1989). L. nobilis is known by different names. In Urdu, it is known as teejh pat. In English, it is typically called bay leaf or sweet bay. In Arabic, it is known as waraq ghaar. In German, it is known as lorbeer. In Greek, it is called dafni. In India, specifically in Hindi, it is called teejpatta. In Meghalaya, bay leaf unit production ranges from 30 to 70 kg per tree per year, but in Nepal, the average range is 13 kg of the dry leaves. About 900 tons of bay leaf are produced in Udaipur district, and 2100 tons are exported by Nepal to India (Choudhary et al., 2014). Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean regions are the biggest collection areas of bay leaf for export (Nurba\u015f and Bal, 2005). Turkey exported 4869 tons of bay leaf to the United States in 2002 (Deniz, 2012).",

In warmer weather, leaves may burn; therefore partial sun shade, well-drained sandy soil that has some moisture, and a pH range of 4.5\u20138.2 are preferred. Bay bears black fruit and yellowish-white fluffy flowers in warmer areas. Temperatures below 28\u00b0F and extensive freezing will kill the bay (Kemp et al., 1983). Bay is widely growing in the following countries: India, Pakistan, other Southeast Asian countries, some Pacific islands, Australia, around the coast of the Mediterranean and Southern Europe, Greece, Portugal, France, Turkey, Spain, Algeria, Morocco, Belgium, Central America, Mexico, Southern United States, and the Canary Islands (Parthasarathy et al., 2008).",

It has flavonoids, tannins, eugenol, citric acid, carbohydrate, steroids, alkaloids, triterpenoids, and essential oils. Antioxidant properties were discovered in the extract of bay leaf to have phenolic compounds. Each of these chemical constituents varies depending on the type of species. Tanine is a liquid glycoside derived from polypeptide and ester polymer that can be hydrolyzed by the secretion of bile (3, 4, 5\u2013trinidrokside benzoic acid) and glucose (Sumono, 2008). Tanine or tanat acid isolated from some part of plants can be found in the market. It is a cream-colored powder, aromatic, with astringent taste (Sumono, 2008). Tanine is used as an astringent for the gastrointestinal tract or skin and can cause precipitation of the cell membrane protein. It also has a little penetration activity, so it can influence the permeability of the cell membrane.",

Hot air drying at 60\u00b0C is the best method for producing bay leaves. Steam distillation is the best method for the recovery of essential oils from the bay leaf plant.

            "text": "Bay has many uses ranging from culinary to religious. There are number of curious beliefs associated with the historical use of bay leaf. The Temple of Delphi, dedicated to Apollo, used many bay leaves. The roof was made of bay leaves, and priestesses would have to eat bay before giving their oracles. This may have been aided by bay's slightly narcotic qualities. Thus bay leaves are said to aid with psychic powers, particularly prophetic dreams, clairvoyance, protection, healing, purification, strength, wishes, magic, exorcism, divination, visions, inspiration, wisdom, meditation, defense, and accessing the creative world. Israelite society consider the bay leaf as a symbol of victory over misfortune; they were very impressed by this tree. Ancient Mediterraneans said this tree radiates protective power and prevents them from misfortune, so it is planted near houses to keep lightning away. The Romans and Greeks used this as a head band mainly for their respected citizens, poets, heroes, and priests, and they consider sleeping with bay leaves to make a man a poet. Romans also believed that this tree protects from lightning, so Emperor Tiberius always kept a bay leaf hat because he had a fear of thunderstorms; and from witches and wizards. The French sometimes call bay the \u201cberries of bay,\u201d and they crowned intelligent people with its berries and leaves, which are burned to increase the psychic powers and protect from evil and negativity. Chinese have a belief that to remove evil messes and crossed conditions, bay leaf with washed water can be used. Many people kept them in mojo bags to prevent unwanted interference from people.",

It is an essential ingredient of many herbs and used in soups, stews, and stuffings, as well as fish, meats, vegetables, sauce, pickles, and sausages. It is easily blended with many other herbs such as garlic, mustard, pepper, parsley, rosemary, thyme, and oregano. Bay can also be an important ingredient in teas, oils, cheeses, and liquors, and its essential oil is used in the cosmetic industry for soaps, perfumes, prepared foods, beverages, and dental products. Bay has many traditional medical uses. Leaves are used for the treatment of skin rashes, earaches, and rheumatism. The leaves have aromatic fragrance, so they are kept in cloths and used to cover up bad mouth odor. The leaves of this plant, having a pepper odor and clove-like taste, are used in cooking. In addition to cooking, leaves and bark are used in treatment of rheumatism, nausea, vomiting, fever, anemia, body odor, diarrhea, and colic due to having astringent, aromatic, stimulant, and carminative qualities. Seeds mixed with honey or sugars are used in cough and dysentery in children.",

Antioxidants such as vitamin C, vitamin E, and carotenoids are used in many dietary sources and are used to lower blood cholesterol and uric acid level. Bay leaves have many sesquiterpene lactones that are responsible for inhibition of NO production, i.e., antiinflammatory, inhibition of alcohol absorption, and may improve liver glutathione S-transferase activity (Fang et al., 2005). Using bioassay-directed isolation study, different cytotoxic and apoptosis-induced compounds are identified in bay leaf. Many components of essential oil of bay leaf such as eugenol, methyl eugenol, and pinene have anticonvulsant activity, while eugenol, methyl eugenol, and cineole produce sedation and motor impairment (Sayyah et al., 2002). Essential oil of this leaf also has analgesic and many antiinflammatory activities (Barla et al., 2007). Many polar compounds such as flavones, flavonol, and phenols are present in the methanolic extract of bay leaf and show antioxidative activity.",

It is used with warm water for drinking to treat internal ailments; as a result, excess water is removed by body by urination and acts as an emetic to induce vomiting. Fresh, mature leaves are used to treat blood dysentery, inflammation, and congestion of kidney. Bay leaf is also used to treat arthritis, headache, fungal diseases, anorexia, colds, cataracts, diarrhea, colic ulcer, appetizer, neuralgia, and digestive stimulant traditionally (Parthasarathy et al., 2008). Bay is found effective against many infections from fungi, viruses, bacteria, and protozoa. Bay is also helpful in inhibiting growth of carcinogenic cells. The leaves of bay are specific for many fevers, cough, flu, bronchitis, asthma, influenza, cough, cold, lowering blood cholesterol level, chicken pox, diarrhea, and antistress agents. Bay juice is an effective medication for sore eyes and night blindness, which is generally caused by deficit of vitamin A.
