The suspected patents were usually with characteristics of fever and 130 and control of COVID-19 ( Figure 3 ). Unlike the common dynamic model used only 141 linear differential equations, this model applied the increasement of testing capacity 142 into account. Since the quarantine measures in Hubei, the contact probability among 143 people was reduced, which significantly reduced the possibility of large-scale 144 transmission. Meanwhile, due to quarantine, people were more alert to fever and other 145 symptoms, leading to more patients surged into the hospital and a continuous 146 increasement suspected cases. The purpose of nucleic acid testing was to 1) identify 147 patients with COVID-19 from the uninfected, and allow them to be hospitalized; 2) 148 after the symptoms disappear, the inpatient with more than twice negative testing results 149 (the interval must be more than 24 hours) could be discharged [3] . 150",
