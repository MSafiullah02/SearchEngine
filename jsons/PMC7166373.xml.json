            "text": "The ubiquity of positive abundance\u2010occupancy relationships has engendered considerable interest in the causes of this widespread relationship. Indeed, both theoretical and empirical explanations for the relationship abound (see Gaston, Blackburn & Lawton 1997; Holt, Gaston & He 2002a; for review). Ecological mechanisms include differences in resource availability, species resource breadth, population characteristics and biotic interactions (e.g. Brown 1984; Warren & Gaston 1997; Gaston et al. 2000; Holt, Warren & Gaston 2002b), while several mechanisms based on the spatial distribution of individuals have also been proposed (Hanski, Kouki & Halkka 1993; He & Gaston 2000a, 2000b; Holt et al. 2002a). The relationship also has considerable intrinsic value because it can be used to predict species abundance levels from measures of occupancy (Kunin 1998; He & Gaston 2000a). Successful prediction of this kind has important potential application in conservation assessment and monitoring (Kunin 1998; He & Gaston 2000a, 2000b), and in the prediction of insect pest population densities from incidence measures in agroecosystems (Legg et al. 1992; Peng & Brewer 1994; Perry 1995).",

            "text": "To predict species abundance from occupancy an appropriate description of the underlying spatial distribution of its individuals is required. The negative binomial distribution (NBD) has most frequently been used, because individuals commonly have contagious distributions (Pielou 1977; Taylor, Woiwood & Perry 1978; Legg et al. 1992). However, the relationship between abundance and occupancy is also well described by a range of other models, including poisson, power and logistic models, as well as variations thereof (Bliss & Fisher 1953; Pielou 1977; Nachman 1981; He, Gaston & Wu 2002; Holt et al. 2002a). Recently, Kunin (1998), Harte, Kinsig & Green (1999) and Harte, Blackburn & Ostling (2001) suggested that self\u2010similarity, and the comparison of abundance\u2013occupancy patterns across spatial scales, might be used to further understand the relationship. Taking Kunin's (1998) rationale of using cross\u2010scale occupancy comparisons a step further, He & Gaston (2000a) derived a model (hereafter the HG model) from the NBD to predict the abundances of species from measures of their occupancy. He & Gaston (2000a) parameterize the model using two spatial scales of occupancy data to estimate species abundance, simultaneously estimating the parameter k for the sampling extent of interest (hereafter the HG (parameterization) method). As the degree of aggregation of individuals increases, the parameter k of the NBD declines. Because k is estimated as part of the parameterization process, the model is generalisable to situations across the continuum of regular, random to aggregated species distributions (He & Gaston 2000a). In contrast to all previous models, the HG parameterization method requires no a priori estimates of aggregation, slope or intercept parameters for the abundance\u2010occupancy relationship. The model is thus considered to be appropriate across a wide range of biological situations (He & Gaston 2000a, 2000b). Indeed, the HG model was used to successfully predict abundance levels from occupancy for tree species (at a local scale) and passerine birds (at a regional scale) (He & Gaston 2000a, 2000b; Kunin, Hartley & Lennon 2000).",

            "text": "Nonetheless, He & Gaston (2000b) have pointed out that the model has several limitations. For example, the efficiency of the model declines with increasing grain and extent, and model predictions are therefore expected to be best at fine scales. The value of the aggregation parameter, k, estimated by the HG method is thus sensitive to sampling extent (He & Gaston 2000b). The value tends to increase with spatial scale and this results in a simultaneous, disproportionate increase in the degree to which abundance is underestimated, i.e. at large scales species are predicted to be less aggregated, and abundances therefore lower, by the HG method than they are in reality (Kunin et al. 2000).",

The finest possible MMUs for a species would be those that are equivalent to the size of its individuals, where any occupancy measure would provide an exact measure of its abundance. Such an approach is sampling intensive and most often impracticable. In addition, MMUs defined in this way will also not necessarily permit comparisons between species of different sizes from the same assemblage (McGeoch & Gaston 2002). It is therefore not surprising that most species occupancy data are collected at scales far coarser than the size of individuals of the species concerned (McGeoch & Gaston 2002). Coarse\u2010scale MMUs, however, fail to discern fine\u2010scale distribution patterns (e.g. intraspecific aggregation), resulting in either over\u2010 or underestimates of abundance (Thomas & Abery 1995; He & Gaston 2000a; Kunin et al. 2000). Therefore, a compromise must be reached between sampling scales that are practical, and those that will provide a satisfactory estimate of species abundance.",

In butterflies, declines in the abundance of common species have been shown to go undetected at large scales, while the range sizes of rare species are overestimated at coarse scales (Thomas & Abery 1995; Cowley et al. 1999). Furthermore, k of the negative binomial distribution is known to be sensitive to species density and may need to be adjusted accordingly (Taylor, Woiwood & Perry 1979; but see Peng & Brewer 1994). Therefore, the HG method is unlikely to predict the abundance of rare and common species (Gaston 1994a) equally well at a particular scale.",

In consequence, it has a wide range of potential applications in macroecology, conservation biology, and pest management (Gaston 1999). However, despite its potential importance, it remains to be empirically tested across a broad range of taxa and spatial scales. Indeed, with the exception of the tests based on the Pasoh tree and Bedfordshire passerine data, few other tests of this model and its parameterization method have been undertaken (He & Gaston 2000a). The objective here is therefore to provide an empirical test of the HG model and parameterization method using a Drosophilidae assemblage that is an exemplar of many systems characterized by a highly aggregated spatial distribution at local scales (Atkinson & Shorrocks 1984; Rosewell, Shorrocks & Edwards 1990). We first determine if the spatial distributions of the species follow the NBD; providing a priori justification of the suitability of using the HG model. We then test the accuracy of the abundance predictions of the HG model for the species in this assemblage, defining the finest MMU as the single resource unit, i.e. a decaying fruit. Using accurate occupancy records determined in a mesocosm at three spatial scales (MMUs), we test if the abundances of rare and common species in the assemblage are predicted equally well. The effect of substituting k\u2010values, calculated independently of the HG parameterization method, on model predictions are also assessed. Finally, we evaluate the effect of increasing MMU size on the accuracy of the abundance prediction by determining the scale at which the HG model prediction most closely matches the measured abundance of each species.",

The table was placed inside a cage covered with pigeon wire to exclude birds, fruit\u2010piercing moths and large wasps, while allowing the flies ready access to the fruit. Ants were also excluded by the application of grease to the Table 1 egs. The table was divided into six equal plots with each plot supporting 36 nectarines (n = 216 nectarines) (Fig. 1). Three of the plots in alternate rows of the two columns were artificially shaded with 80% shade netting to impose a level of microclimatic heterogeneity on the experiment (Fig. 1). The nectarines were placed 20 cm apart in a regular grid of 12 \u00d7 18 fruit, resembling a regular arrangement of plants in a field, where each plant would be the unit from which presence or absence (occupancy) of a species would be determined. Each fruit was placed on a plastic mesh in the centre of a round plastic container (\u223c15 cm diameter and 8 cm deep) containing washed, moist sand. Drosophilidae larvae drop down into the substrate under the fruit when they are ready to pupate after 4\u00b75\u20138\u00b75 days at 25 \u00b0C and 80% RH (Sevenster & van Alphen 1993). Larvae were therefore allowed to pupate in moist sand underneath the fruit. Starting from the fifth day after exposure of the fruit, the sand containing the fly pupae was removed and placed in 350 mL plastic jars every second day for 25 days in November 1998. The plastic jars were then taken to the laboratory and the emerging flies were identified (according to McEvey et al. 1988). Fresh, moist sand was immediately placed in the containers under the fruit at each collection.",

Fly emergence was 2\u00b71 times higher on the 23rd day than any other pupation date and the distribution\u2010abundance patterns of individuals pupating on this date are examined here. The data used thus represent the largest cohort of flies simultaneously present in the fruit. At least six Drosophilidae species were found. However, specimens belonging to the genus Zaprionus could not be identified to species level. The identified species were: Drosophila simulans Sturtevant, D. melanogaster Meigen, D. busckii Coquillett, D. buzzatii Patterson & Wheeler, Zaprionus morphospecies group 1 (which may include both Z. tuberculatus Malloch and Z. sepsoides Duda) and Zaprionus morphospecies group 2 (which may include Z. vittiger Coquillett and Z. indianus Gupta) (McEvey et al. 1988). Damaged specimens (n = 55 of 3029 flies) that could not be identified to species level were removed from subsequent analyses. However, 50 of these specimens were either D. simulans or D. melanogaster, and are most likely to have been the former because this species was overwhelmingly dominant. The remaining 5 individuals were all Zaprionus species. The total measured abundance of each species was calculated by summing the abundance values across all 216 fruit for each of the six species. Species constituting < 5% of all individuals caught were considered rare. Occupancy (number of MMUs occupied on the table \u00d7 size of individual unit of a MMU in m2) was calculated for each species in three MMU sizes: 1 \u00d7 1 fruit (0\u00b704 m2; n= 216 \u2018grid cells\u2019), 2 \u00d7 2 fruit (0\u00b716 m2; n= 54 \u2018grid cells\u2019) and 3 \u00d7 3 fruit (0\u00b736 m2; n= 24 \u2018grid cells\u2019).

Here, A\na is the measured occupancy (free of sampling error) for each fly species because all flies in each fruit were counted and identified (including those of the rare species). Therefore, complete abundance and occupancy records were used that were not subject to sampling artefacts. Abundance (N\u0302) and k (aggregation parameter) are solved simultaneously in equation 2, using the Newton\u2010Raphson iteration method (Mathews 1987), for each of two MMUs (spatial scales) for each species (the HG method). MMU pairs that were used to estimate abundance and k for each species were (i) 0\u00b704 m2 and 0\u00b716 m2 (ii) 0\u00b704 m2 and 0\u00b736 m2, and (iii) 0\u00b716 m2 and 0\u00b736 m2. To determine if the estimated abundances for each species were similar for the three sets of MMU pairs, they were compared using Sign tests (Sokal & Rohlf 1998). Predicted abundances were compared to real abundances using a Chi\u2010square test (Sokal & Rohlf 1998). The accuracy of the HG method was calculated as predicted abundance/real abundance. Values closest to unity indicate predicted abundances that are equivalent to real abundances and are therefore the most accurate.

(2000) also found that the HG method underestimates abundances, the magnitude of this underestimation was not as large as that found here. In the absence of sampling error, such underestimation is thought to arise in two ways: (1) deviation of the species spatial distribution pattern from the NBD, and (2) MMUs that are too large to detect sufficient variation in species abundance across the sampling extent (He & Gaston 2000a; Falster, Murray & Lepschi 2001). We demonstrated that the abundance distributions of the Drosophilidae used here did not deviate significantly from the NBD. Rosewell et al. (1990) also found that the NBD adequately described the distribution of Drosophila assemblages, and the NBD distribution is not unusual for invertebrate assemblages (Sevenster 1996). However, the distributions of the data we use must deviate to some extent from a perfect NBD. This deviation, although not significant, may be sufficient to result in substantial underestimation of species abundances. Any deviation from the NBD by species that are more strongly aggregated than this distribution predicts, thus results in significant underestimation of abundance values. The limiting values of k lead to other mathematical distributions, and as k\u2192 0 (strong aggregation) the distribution converges to the logarithmic series (Quenouille 1949). Therefore, although the maximum likelihood solution approach to calculating k of the NBD is definitive (Anscombe 1950; Bliss & Fisher 1953), the test of significance for the fit of data to a NBD is clearly not sufficiently sensitive to be used to identify assemblages with distributions for which the HG model would be appropriate. Distribution\u2010fitting tests are known to have low power (May 1975; Buzas et al. 1982; McGeoch & Gaston 2002) and are therefore not an effective means of determining the appropriateness of the HG model. A statistic more sensitive to departures from the NBD as k\u2192 0 would be a useful tool for testing the suitability of assemblages for application of the HG model.",

In this study the finest possible minimum mapping unit with realistic habitat boundaries was used, i.e. the fruit. Predicted abundances were indeed closest to reality at this smallest MMU for all species. Nonetheless, aggregation still occurred beyond the resolution achievable with this finest MMU, resulting in an overestimation of k by the HG method (k\nHG). In most highly aggregated assemblages a MMU that is the size of the single resource unit may contain numerous individuals (Atkinson 1985; Shorrocks & Rosewell 1987). Consequently, resource units containing either one or 335 individuals (such as D. simulans in this study) will yield identical occurrence maps. A single fruit represents a MMU that is far \u2018too large\u2019 to achieve an accurate estimate of abundance, using the HG method, for assemblages that are highly aggregated. However, it is not only impractical but also unrealistic to use a MMU smaller than a single fruit for assemblages such as this. Therefore, although the use of coarse MMUs is known to reduce the accuracy of abundances predicted (He & Gaston 2000b), even the use of the finest possible, and biologically realistic, MMUs may be inadequate to predict abundances accurately. There are many such assemblages where the resource unit is generally considered the smallest practicable MMU, e.g. those associated with tree holes, dung, carcasses, fruit and flower heads. Although habitat units are usually larger than the size of the individual utilizing them, these habitats are (i) a standardized unit for all the species in the assemblage (this is required in order to make cross\u2010species comparisons, McGeoch & Gaston 2002) (ii) readily measured in the field and (iii) represent a habitat with a functional boundary unlike the artificial boundaries of grid cells, i.e. representation\u2010based sample units, sensu\nGaston (1994b). As a result, habitat units are likely to remain the MMU used for such assemblages.",

Based on published k\u2010values (estimated using the NBD) for a variety of taxa, strong levels of aggregation are apparently widespread; for example, in weevils (Peng & Brewer 1994), eight species of Drosophila (Shorrocks & Rosewell 1987; Rosewell et al. 1990), various other Diptera (Atkinson & Shorrocks 1984; Renshaw et al. 1995), eriophyid mites (Hall, Childers & Eger 1991) and a variety of solanaceous and other, annual, plant species (Timmer et al. 1989; Johnson et al. 1995). Although the k\u2010values for these taxa ranged between 7\u00b715 and < 0\u00b7005, k\u2010values in the range of 0\u00b701 to 0\u00b76 were most common, demonstrating very high levels of aggregation. For species such as these, the only solution for abundance estimation unfortunately remains the use of a reasonably accurate estimate of aggregation (k) prior to application of the model, which requires an a priori abundance estimate (e.g. the Nachman model, Nachman 1981; see also Holt et al. 2002a) and thus defeats the purpose of the He & Gaston (2000a) approach.",

Were it possible to derive accurate predictions of pest abundance from these data alone, more reliable damage estimates and economic injury levels could be calculated. Other than the insensitivity of the parameterization method to very high degrees of aggregation, the HG model appears highly suitable for such application. Pest abundance estimates are generally required for scales in the order of single or multiple fields or orchards, scales much finer than geographical mapping data readily available for many plant and vertebrate taxa. Mapping units and sampling extent are thus comparatively fine. Furthermore, predictions of abundance and k could be derived using a short range of scales (small spatial scale differences between the two minimum mapping units used), which is another of the conditions for optimal performance of the HG method (He & Gaston 2000b; Kunin et al. 2000).",

Here, the distinction is made between aggregation in the form of statistical vs. spatial heterogeneity (Perry 1998). Statistical heterogeneity arises from kurtosis in the frequency distribution of records, and the degree to which this fits a particular distribution (such as the NBD), whereas spatial heterogeneity results from the clumping of records, or their deviation from a regular spatial arrangement (Perry 1998). Aggregation estimates based on k of the NBD, including those estimated by the HG method, quantify statistical heterogeneity, but do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of abundance\u2010occupancy records. However, for abundant species, deviation from spatial regularity is likely to be large when the level of aggregation by individuals within habitat units (or MMUs) is high. Indeed, the abundances of rare species in this Drosophilidae assemblage were more accurately predicted by the HG method than the abundance of the common species (although the HG model performs equally well for rare and common species when provided with an accurate estimate of k). Therefore, for species known to be abundant (e.g. eruptive or outbreak species), estimates may be improved by incorporating this additional dimension of spatial information into abundance\u2010occupancy models (see approaches by Perry 1998; Perry et al. 1999). Such spatially explicit exploration of the approach pioneered by He & Gaston (2000a) would clearly repay the effort because the latter provides a useful and much\u2010needed means of predicting abundance from occupancy data, with considerable value in applied ecology.",
