This diverse set of effector functions generally contributes to clearance of infection but can also lead to immunopathology. Circulating CD8+ T lymphocytes derive their specificity from highly variable but clonally distributed T\u2010cell receptors (TCRs) that inspect class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) glycoproteins. The composite surface of the surveyed molecule consists of an intracellularly derived antigenic peptide ligand that is presented by a protein heterodimer comprising the MHC heavy chain as well as an invariant beta\u20102 microglobulin (\u03b22m) light chain. For humans, the class I gene products of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) family of restriction elements are classical transplantation antigens encoded by three separate loci (i.e. HLA\u2010A, \u2010B, and \u2010C) that are highly polymorphic. HLA variability and geographical distribution are significantly correlated, and allelic variants mark distinct ethnic groups. As a consequence, host ethnicity shapes the fine specificity of T\u2010lymphocyte reactivity to several viral afflictions such as EBV 1, hepatitis B (HBV) 2, HCV 3, and HIV 4.",

Several methodologies emerged to manage the variables affecting MHC antigen presentation, and enable multiparametric analysis of antigen\u2010specific T\u2010cell responses 8, 9. Combinatorial coding of MHC multimers, for example, has allowed parallel detection of multiple T\u2010cell specificities using limited numbers of fluorochromes in high\u2010throughput flow cytometry 10, 11. Another technological breakthrough came with the development of conditional ligands both for HLA complexes 12, 13 and murine MHCs 14, 15, 16, which facilitate the production of peptide\u2010MHC reagents of diverse specificity from a common precursor through a peptide\u2010exchange strategy. Originally, these reagents were designed for the archetypical HLA\u2010A*02:01 12, and were later expanded to A*01:01, A*03:01, A*11:01, B*07:02 13, as well as B*57:03 17, thereby providing significant coverage for the Western European population. Over half of the world's population, however, inhabits regions within Asia and Oceania or has its origins there (World Population Data sheet 2011, http://www.prb.org/Publications/Datasheets/2011/world-population-data-sheet/data-sheet.aspx). Paradoxically, the accurate definition of T\u2010cell epitopes for Asian HLA variants has long trailed its European counterparts. Therefore, we report the peptide\u2010exchange technology for seven HLA\u2010A, five HLA\u2010B, and four HLA\u2010C restriction elements commonly associated with Asian ancestry to enable comprehensive assessment of the corresponding CD8+ T\u2010cell responses.",

The caged HLA complexes subsequently facilitate the rapid determination of peptide fine specificity and HLA restriction, thus alleviating an epitope discovery bottleneck while conserving PBMC samples in the process. Retrospective assessment of our screening demonstrates that the majority of these epitopes would not have been discovered if only select restriction elements or antigenic proteins had been considered, or bioinformatic selection of peptides applied; the restrictions that are commonly imposed 10, 18, 19, 20.",

We aimed to develop conditional ligands for the principal SEA variants consisting of HLA\u2010A*02:03, \u2010A*02:06, \u2010A*02:07, \u2010A*02:11, \u2010A*11:01, \u2010A*24:02, \u2010A*33:03, \u2010B*15:02, \u2010B*40:01, \u2010B*46:01, \u2010B*55:02, \u2010B*58:01, \u2010C*03:04, \u2010C*04:01, \u2010C*07:02, and \u2010C*08:01.

Strategic amino acid substitutions were aimed at generating a ligand with unperturbed HLA affinity and several designs were tested (Fig. 2 and Supporting Information Fig. 1A). The Anp introduction in central positions of the peptide endeavored effective liberation of the peptide\u2010binding cleft after UV\u2010induced fragmentation. After their synthesis, the identity of the conditional ligands was ascertained with LCMS analysis (Supporting Information Fig. 1B). Each peptide was subsequently refolded with its corresponding heavy and light chain, biotinylated, and purified by size\u2010exclusion chromatography to produce HLA monomers 22. Although comparing yields is contentious, as the refolding concerns distinct molecular complexes, several trends were discernible. For example, the HLA\u2010A products with an average yield of approximately 10 mg/L outperformed HLA\u2010B that furnished only approximately 3.2 mg/L. Variation could be as high as 300\u2010fold between HLA products, with A*24:02 providing the highest (\u223c45 mg/L) and A*33:03 (\u223c0.15 mg/L) the lowest yield, presumably reflecting differences both in ligand affinity as well as the overall stability of the complex. For analogs designed from the same parent peptide, 100\u2010fold differences could be observed (\u223c13 mg/L to \u223c0.15 mg/mL for A*33:03). The highest yielding conditional ligand for each HLA was selected for the following experiments (Fig. 2).",

We evaluated the structural integrity of our HLA complexes by monitoring for the presence of the noncovalently associated \u03b22m subunit. The in vitro HLA\u2010stability ELISA allowed us to verify the extent of HLA disintegration during various stages of the photocleavage reaction as indicator for effective peptide exchange 22. For the 16 pertinent HLAs, no appreciable degradation of conditional ligand\u2010loaded complexes was observed in the absence of UV irradiation (Fig. 3). Exposure to UV light resulted in near\u2010quantitative loss of signal for the majority of HLA products examined. However, A*11:01, A*24:02, C*07:02, and C*08:01 displayed exceptional stability with up to 39% of \u03b22m still present after cleavage (Fig. 3) that is reminiscent of the production yield of those complexes (Fig. 2). After UV fragmentation 12, the unfolding, aggregation, and precipitation of the complex could be prevented by inclusion of peptides capable of reoccupying the peptide\u2010binding groove, thus conferring stability, and delivering novel specificity in the process. For antigens derived from EBV, human cytomegalovirus, HBV, DENV, and influenza A virus that conform to the reported restriction elements, restoration of each of the 16 complexes with at least two separate ligands proved feasible in individual exchange reactions (Fig. 3 and Supporting Information Table 2). However, peptides lacking the proper complementarity failed to rescue the HLA after UV irradiation, especially when mismatched in HLA supertype 21. For example, the EBV\u2010derived LMP2426\u2013434 (CLGGLLTMV) restricted by A*02:01 (i.e. HLA\u2010A2 supertype) proved unable to conserve the integrity of B*40:01. HLA micropolymorphisms also affect peptide binding, where both Env183\u2013191 (FLLTKILTI) and Pol455\u2013463 (GLSRYVARL) associate well with A*02:01 2, but only Env183\u2013191 proved capable of stabilizing the closely related variants A*02:03, A*02:06, and A*02:11 (Fig. 3). Collectively, this demonstrates successful temporary stabilization and peptide\u2010exchange using conditional ligands tailored to Asian HLA variants.",

EBNA3A831\u2013839\u2010specific T\u2010cells were first observed 8 days poststimulation by HLA\u2010B*15:01 tetramers, and could also be detected with B*15:02 tetramers. Moreover, we subjected HLA\u2010A*02:01 restricted FLPSDFFPSV\u2010specific cells, engineered by TCR gene transfer 24, to staining with HLA\u2010A*02:03, \u2010A*02:06, \u2010A*02:07, and \u2010A*02:11 tetramers loaded with the HBV Core 18\u201327 peptide to evaluate the capacity of the TCR to discriminate between micropolymorphisms in HLA\u2010A2 subtypes common in the SEA population (Fig. 1). Cross\u2010specific recognition was observed for HLA\u2010A*02:06 and \u2010A*02:07 presenting the HBV peptide, yet no positive staining was obtained with HLA\u2010A*02:03 or \u2010A*02:11 tetramers. The dearth of known epitopes for Asian HLA variants precluded confirmation of tetramer functionality for HLA\u2010A*02:03, \u2010A*02:11, and \u2010B*46:01. HLA\u2010C\u2010restricted responses were similarly absent in our donor cohort.",

We screened for CD8+ T\u2010cell responses in individuals with a history of acute HBV, exposure to DENV, or SARS\u2010CoV. PBMCs were in vitro stimulated with peptide pools of 15\u2010mers overlapping by ten amino acids, thus covering the entire viral proteome of DENV\u20102 (660 peptides), HBV genotype B (313 peptides), and the SARS\u2010CoV NP (83 peptides), and 3a protein (53 peptides) 2, 25. IFN\u2010\u03b3 secretion was first assessed by ELISPOT, and positive pools were deconvoluted by stimulating the PBMCs with individual peptides followed by measuring IFN\u2010\u03b3 production by intracellular cytokine staining. We identified novel CD8+ T\u2010cell responses against 15\u2010mers derived from HBV polymerase (Pol33) and (Env72, Env34), DENV nonstructural protein 3 (NS3\u2013108), as summarized in Fig. 5A, together with antigens embedded in the SARS\u2010CoV nucleocapsid and 3a proteins (NP44, NP65, 3a2) 25. Based on the HLA genotyping of the short\u2010term T\u2010cell lines (Supporting Information Table 3) and the HLA\u2010binding motifs 21, we anticipated the restriction elements of the HBV Pol33 and Env72 lines to be B*58:01, and the DENV NS3\u2013108 line to be B*55:02. The SARS\u2010CoV NP65 and 3a2 peptides were known to be presented by B*40:01 and B*58:01, respectively. To move away from inferring HLA restriction from panels of peptide\u2010pulsed B lymphoblastoid cell lines (B\u2010LCLs), which is consumptive on samples, we derived 18 distinct overlapping 9\u2010, 10\u2010, and 11\u2010mer peptides from each 15\u2010mer epitope (Supporting Information Fig. 3A). The HLA\u2010stability ELISA allowed us to rapidly screen the ability of each peptide to rescue various HLA complexes from denaturation 22. The SARS NP44 15\u2010mer 25, for example, had three embedded peptides restricted by either A*02:01 or B*40:01 (Fig. 5B\u2013E). For the SARS\u2010CoV, DENV, and HBV 15\u2010mer antigens, we found at least one peptide in each 18\u2010member set that stabilized an HLA product from our library. These 9\u2010 and 10\u2010mers mostly bound to the anticipated HLAs (Supporting Information Fig. 3B\u2013I), and were often positioned at the N\u2010 or C\u2010terminus of the parent peptide (Fig. 5A), underscoring the importance of the overlapping peptide screening approach.",

We frequently observed that the extension or contraction by a single amino was not detrimental to HLA binding of a peptide, yet only optimal epitopes were recognized by their corresponding TCRs. Short\u2010term expanded SARS\u2010CoV NP65, DENV NS3\u2013108, and HBV Pol33 and Env72\u2010specific lines stained with their corresponding B*40:01, B*55:02, or B*58:01 tetramers (Fig. 6B) but not PBMCs from unrelated controls (Fig. 6A). For the SARS 3a2 and HBV Env34 lines, the peptides preselected by ELISA failed to yield functional staining reagents. Comprehensive tetramer screens with all 18 truncated peptides; however, revealed SITAQPVKI and FLGPLLVLQA to be the optimal antigens presented by B*58:01 and C*08:01, respectively. For the seven characterized epitopes (Table 1), T cells bound their HLA counterpart with moderate affinity, as judged by the MFI shift for the individual tetramers. Only the B*58:01\u2010presented HBV Pol33 9\u2010mer and HBV Env34 10\u2010mer being displayed by C*08:01 provided staining such that antigen\u2010specific cells were clearly resolved from the main CD8+ T\u2010cell population.

We selected NetMHCpan, which (i) has the ability to compute the binding capability of peptides even for HLA products for which experimental data is scarce, (ii) can accommodate epitopes of variable length, and (iii) is publicly accessible 28, 29, 30. We performed IC50 predictions for all possible 8, 9, 10, and 11\u2010mer epitopes (encompassing 2716 SARS\u2010CoV, 6256 HBV, and 12690 DENV peptides) of each HLA variant of the donor's genotype. For data inclusion, we imposed a 1000 nM affinity threshold, which is less stringent than the conventional IC50 cutoff of 500 nM, while providing an estimated specificity of 0.95 and sensitivity of 0.74 29. Peptides were ranked by IC50 value, and for each experimentally derived epitope the rank was determined within the complete HLA constellation of the PBMC donor as well as for the correct restriction element (Table 2). Even this liberal strategy would instantly preclude the discovery of two novel epitopes. Peptides SITAQPVKI and FLGPLLVLQA were predicted not to bind HLA\u2010B*58:01 and HLA\u2010C*08:01, respectively, with IC50 values 10\u201320 fold above the cutoff. Moreover, predictions can be misguiding, as FLGPLLVLQA was predicted to have affinity for HLA\u2010A*02:01 (20.44 nM), while for its true restriction element HLA\u2010C*08:01 the IC50 of 22942.68 nM would have excluded it from consideration. Given that predictive methods aim to reduce the magnitude of the peptide collection under investigation, a full proteome\u2010based bioinformatics screen should encompass no more peptides than an overlapping peptide library. In this scenario, the total number of peptides to screen with NetMHCpan would at most be equal to the collection of our ELISPOT screens (i.e. 313 peptides for HBV, 136 peptides for SARS\u2010CoV, and 660 peptides for DENV). The conditional tetramer reagents developed here comprise 17 different HLA molecules, including the reported HLA\u2010A*02:01 12, and therefore the number of highest ranking peptides to screen per HLA will be 18 for HBV, eight for SARS\u2010CoV, and 38 for DENV. Following these criteria, three of the seven novel epitopes would not have been discovered based on HLA\u2010specific rankings (i.e. SITAQPVKI, SVIWMMWYW, FLGPLLVLQA, Table 2). If the NetMHCpan algorithm would have been employed to curtail the peptide collection to half the size of an ELISPOT screen, the peptides to screen per HLA would be nine for HBV, four for SARS\u2010CoV, and 19 for DENV, and the majority of novel antigens (i.e. MEVTPSGTWL, SITAQPVKI, SVIWMMWYW, FLGPLLVLQA) would have been missed. Although other methods might well outperform on individual allele\u2010specific predictions, we submit that employing NetMHCpan is the most appropriate strategy for PBMC donor cohorts with high HLA polymorphism 28, 29, 30, particularly in populations with a preponderance of class I HLA variants for which limited experimentally verified data is available. This exposes current limitations with the deployment of predictive algorithms and validates our approach of using overlapping peptide libraries together with high\u2010throughput tetramer screening to identify and characterize novel T\u2010cell epitopes.",

This strategy can be applied for screening of class I MHC\u2010associated antigens. We sought to extend this technology specifically for Asian populations, and therefore designed and synthesized 30 UV\u2010light sensitive conditional ligands, and constructed the corresponding HLA molecules.

The ELISPOT assay, which quantifies the active secretion of cytokines, is recognized for its high sensitivity compared with assays such as bead\u2010based assays or intracellular cytokine staining 31, 32. It also permits screening with pooled overlapping peptides, usage of clinical samples is economical, and lymphocytes maintain their viability, making it amenable for high\u2010throughput proteome\u2010wide antigen screening 31, 32. In ongoing epitope identification efforts for HBV, SARS\u2010CoV, and DENV infection, we identified seven 15\u2010mer peptides capable of stimulating T\u2010cell responses in Singaporean donors (Fig. 5 and 6). The HLA restriction and fine specificity of the epitopes would commonly be inferred from cellular assays. These, however, suffer from simultaneous expression of various HLA variants that complicates data interpretation. We used caged Asian HLAs to measure their receptiveness to accommodate shorter peptides embedded in the parent 15\u2010mer antigen. This rapidly pinpointed the likely antigenic sequences, while utilizing low amounts of HLA reagents and sparing precious PBMC samples. Ultimate confirmation of the peptide fine specificity and HLA restriction element responsible for engendering the T\u2010cell response was provided by staining with arrays of HLA tetramers, which allowed rapid visualization and quantification of in vitro cultured, cryopreserved samples or freshly isolated antigen\u2010specific CD8+ T cells with high specificity and sensitivity. HLA tetramers thus not only permit the monitoring and isolation of antigen\u2010specific T lymphocytes 5, 6, 7, but their usage extends to screening for novel CD8+ T\u2010cell antigens 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. In seven of seven times, the antigenic epitope was correctly identified, validating our approach to reduce the number of epitopes by biophysical means. The construction of the 16\u2010membered peptide\u2010exchangeable HLA library gives sufficient coverage for epitope screening in Asia where the probability of matching the HLA profile of a lymphocyte donor with at least one caged HLA is high for SEA (HLA\u2010A: 93%, \u2010B: 63%, \u2010C: 79%) as well as the closely related populations from Oceania (HLA\u2010A: 88%, \u2010B: 46%, \u2010C: 82%). This contrasts with the European (HLA\u2010A: 30%, \u2010B: 11%, \u2010C: 54%) and North American regions (HLA\u2010A: 74%, \u2010B: 5%, \u2010C: 74%) for which equivalent molecules have already been designed 12, 13. Similar efforts in Sub\u2010Saharan Africa (HLA\u2010A: 11%, \u2010B: 23%, \u2010C: 42%) or Southwest Asia (HLA\u2010A: 53%, \u2010B: 10%, \u2010C: 38%), where HLA diversity is more pronounced, would need a suite of reagents that is proportionally extended. Finally, we found through retrospective analysis that bioinformatic strategies for the prediction of HLA\u2010restricted epitopes would likely have failed to identify a considerable portion of the novel CD8 T\u2010cell epitopes described herein.",
