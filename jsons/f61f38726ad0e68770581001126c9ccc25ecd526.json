Intrahospital management and complications highlighted a shorter hospitalization with a faster commencement of physiatric consultancy and a higher absolute number of respiratory infections in 2020. A dramatic prevalence of stroke of unknown symptom onset (SUSO) was found in 2020 (n=8, 50%) compared to 2019 (n=3, 10%). A complete summary of these findings is reported in Table 1 .",

            "text": "The main finding is a reduction of 45% of total admissions in our Hub Stroke Unit compared to the same period in 2019 and a higher prevalence of severe stroke (NIHSS >10) at admission during the COVID-19 pandemics. This may be explained with the lower number of ED admissions of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and minor strokes probably related to the diffused fear of going to the hospital during the pandemia when showing mild or transient stroke symptoms. A similar hypothesis was stated by Baracchini et al. [6]. In addition, in our study we also observed a higher prevalence of SUSO patients with high NIHSS, who may have underestimated their own symptoms and thus delayed the alert. The increased number of SUSOs supports the adoption of a multimodal neuroimaging tissue-based approach (instead of time-based approach) to better define patients eligible to reperfusion therapy [7]. Considering 'code stroke' patients, the comparison of prehospital time response (from alert-to-and intrahospital time response (door-to-treatment) showed no significant differences between 2020 and 2019 periods, suggesting the efficacy of the structured pathways adopted by our local health syst em to treat stroke patients during the COVID-19 emergency.The acute stroke emergency structured pathway for acute stroke, characterized by the suspicious case pre -alert, the presence of two well separated ED and Stroke Unit areas and the extensive and ea rly use of the swabs, made it possible to offer reperfusion treatments in suitable times and protect staff and other inpatients from infection.The worse functional and independence outcomes, despite the similar proportion of treated patients, may be relat ed to the more severe clinical presentation and to a slightly faster time course to discharge. However, the proportion of patients discharged at home and intra-hospital mortality were similar between the two periods. The shorter hospitalization and the ass ociated difficulties in performing all the diagnostic etiology exams (that may involve other specialists) resulted in a lower number of patients that were discharged with a complete stroke work-up (31% vs 69%). Tele-monitoring and tele-assistance solutions, using also smart wearable technologies, in this scenario could reduce this gap and assure patients security in the post-acute phase outside the hospital.Particular attention during pandemics -related countries lockdown should be given to cross -border areas. Indeed, among 16 patients admitted in 2020, 2 of them were part of an international management protocol between Italy and Slovenia, having been cared both in a Slovenian spoke cross -border hospital and in our Hub Stroke Unit despite the strict mobility restrictions.",
