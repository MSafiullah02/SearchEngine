Interestingly, studies in rats have demonstrated that high dietary sodium intake results in down-regulation of the ACE2 expression in kidney tissue. We hypothesize that low sodium status makes kidney involvement during the course of COVID-19 infection more likely due to upregulation of membrane bound ACE2 in the kidneys. We propose that sodium intake and status should be monitored carefully during severe COVID-19 infections, and that low sodium intake be corrected early in its course, despite a potential conflict regarding common dietary recommendations to restrict dietary sodium intake in patients with hypertension, diabetes, and kidney disease.",

            "text": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) is expressed in epithelial cells of many tissues including the kidney, and has been identified to interact with human pathogenic coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (Letko et al., 2020) . Although diffuse alveolar damage and acute respiratory failure are the main features of COVID-19 infection, two recent studies demonstrate that kidney impairment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is common, and that kidney involvement is associated with high risk of in-hospital death (Cheng et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020) . If SARS-CoV-2 becomes systemic after the respiratory system has served as porte d'entr\u00e9e, the kidney is a potential target for the virus, which is supported by results of RNA-sequencing studies, which found up to 100 times higher tissue ACE2 expression in the kidneys compared to the lungs (Fagerberg et al., 2014) . Interestingly, studies in rats have demonstrated that high dietary sodium intake results in down-regulation of the ACE2 expression in kidneys (Cao et al., 2017; Berger et al., 2015) . Indeed, Cao et al. demonstrated that a high sodium diet for 3 weeks more than halved the expression of ACE2 in rat kidney (Cao et al., 2017) . Concordantly, Berger et al. demonstrated a nearly 5-fold higher ACE2 expression in spontaneously hypertensive rats fed a low sodium diet when compared to those on a high sodium diet (Berger et al., 2015) . It should be noted that the high sodium group in the study by Cao et al. was exposed to a 20-times higher sodium intake than the low sodium group (Cao et al., 2017) , while such an extreme difference in sodium intake is rarely seen between humans. Moreover, these experimental studies did not differentiate between cell membrane-bound ACE2 and soluble ACE2, which may be important in light of SARS-CoV-2 exposure to cells. Soluble ACE2 is formed through proteolytic cleavage of membrane bound ACE2 but probably represents only a small fraction of membrane bound ACE2 (Larouche-Lebel et al., 2019). It has been proposed that low sodium balance may lead to more severe COVID-19 (Post et al., 2020) . Indeed, studies on electrolyte disturbances during COVID-19 have shown significantly lower sodium concentrations in patients with severe COVID-19 infection (Lippi et al., 2020) . Here, we hypothesize that low sodium status also makes kidney involvement during the course of COVID-19 infection more likely due to upregulation of membrane-bound ACE2 in the kidneys. The hypothesized interaction between sodium balance, the ACE2 receptor, SARS-CoV-2, and the kidney is shown in Fig. 1 . We propose that sodium intake and status should be monitored carefully during severe COVID-19 infections and low sodium intake be treated early in its course, despite a potential conflict regarding common dietary recommendations to restrict dietary sodium intake in patients with hypertension, diabetes, and kidney disease.
