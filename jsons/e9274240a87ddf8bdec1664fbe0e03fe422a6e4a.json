Flow-cytometric acquisition was performed by using a multi-color BD FACSCanto II instrument, and analyses was done using CellQuest and FlowJo (Tree Star) software.

The absolute numbers of effector CD4+ T cells were calculated by multiplying the total number of viable cells recovered by the percentage of the specific T cell subset detected by flow-cytometric analysis. Stimulation index was obtained by calculating the ratio of stimulated versus unstimulated (medium rest control) T cells that both proliferated and produced cytokine as measured by flow cytometry. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to analyze differences in the expansions of CD4+ T cells in samples from vaccinated and non-vaccinated participants.

RCCA was performed for each post-vaccination day (Day 14 and Day 28 post-second vaccination) and assay (PCTC and cytokine measurements). Prior to modeling, PCTC and cytokine fold change variables were log 2 transformed and then standardized (z-score: mean=0, variance=1). A regularization step was included to avoid overfitting and to handle collinearity within variable sets. Regularization parameters (\u03bb 1 and \u03bb 2 ) were estimated using leave-one-out cross validation (grid-search of 250,000 parameter combinations ranging from 0.000001 to 1 in 500 increments). Correlations between original variables (Pearson correlation) and corresponding canonical variates were calculated (canonical loadings). Canonical loadings were squared to obtain the percent-explained variance for each variable. Tabular and graphical summaries were presented if the model achieved a cross validation score (CV) of \u2265 0.5.",

Gene and T-cell or cytokine variables for which the first two canonical variates explained less than 25% of their total variance (placed within the inner circle of the correlation circle plots) were grayed out. Variables or groups of variables that are closely positioned in these plots are positively correlated while those diametrically opposed are negatively correlated. The strength of the correlation is encoded by the distance from the center of the circle as well as by the angle between variables when viewed as vectors originating from the center. A sharp angle between variables represents a positive correlation, an obtuse angle indicates a negative correlation while a right angle is observed for zero correlation. Thus, maximum correlation is achieved when variables are closely placed together to the outer circle (or directly opposed on the outer circle). KEGG BRITE pathway hierarchy (second level) information for the top five pathway categories (in terms of number of genes that were correlated) was overlaid on top of the correlation circle plots to highlight known functional organization. Identified robust gene clusters were integrated by drawing lines between correlated genes that formed a robust gene cluster.",
