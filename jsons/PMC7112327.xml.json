They consist of virus\u2010specified proteins and nucleic acids and, in the case of enveloped viruses, of host\u2010derived lipids. In infected cells the assembly of these different components into virions occurs with high precision amidst a huge background of tens of thousands of host compounds. Two key factors determine the efficiency of the assembly process: intracellular transport and molecular interactions.",

            "text": "Directional transport ensures the swift and accurate delivery of the virion components to the cellular compartment(s) where they must meet and form (sub)structures. Some viruses achieve this goal relatively simply when genome production occurs in close proximity to the virion assembly site (e.g., picornaviruses). Many viruses, however, have evolved more elaborate strategies. This is illustrated, for instance, by the \u03b1\u2010herpesviruses. Assembly of these viruses starts in the nucleus by the encapsidation of viral DNA, using cytoplasmically synthesized capsid proteins; nucleocapsids then migrate to the cytosol, by budding at the inner nuclear membrane followed by deenvelopment, to pick up the tegument proteins. Subsequently, the tegumented capsids obtain their final envelope by budding into vesicles of the trans\u2010Golgi network (TGN), where the viral envelope proteins have congregated after their synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum; the assembled viral particles are finally released by fusion of the virion\u2010containing vesicles with the plasma membrane. To achieve their transport goals viruses provide their components with address labels that can be read by the transport machinery of the cell. Once brought together, formation of the viral (sub)structures is governed and driven by their interactions. Whereas the assembly of nonenveloped viruses is generally restricted to the cell cytoplasm, although often in association with membranes, that of enveloped viruses involves multiple cellular compartments, as exemplified already for herpesviruses.",

The RNA has a 5\u2032\u2010terminal cap and a 3\u2032\u2010terminal poly(A) tract. Both genomic termini contain untranslated regions (UTRs) of some 200\u2013500 nucleotides that harbor several cis\u2010acting sequences and structural elements functioning in viral replication and transcription. Coronaviruses have a typical genome organization characterized by the occurrence of a distinctive set of genes that are essential for viability and occur in a fixed order: 5\u2032\u2010polymerase (pol)\u2010S\u2010E\u2010M\u2010N\u20103\u2032 (Fig. 3\n). The pol gene comprises approximately two\u2010thirds of the genome, from which it is translated directly. It encodes two large precursors (Pol1a and Pol1ab), the many functional cleavage products of which are collectively responsible for RNA replication and transcription (for reviews on coronavirus transcription and replication see de Vries 1997, Lai 1997, Lai 1997, Lai 1994, Sawicki 1998, Ziebuhr 2000). The more downstream pol1b gene is translated by translational readthrough, using a ribosomal frameshift mechanism for which a \u201cslippery\u201d sequence and a pseudoknot structure are required.",

These so\u2010called group\u2010specific genes appear not to be essential as shown by the occurrence of natural mutants defective in some of them (Brown 1995, Herrewegh 1995, Kennedy 2001, Luytjes 1995, Shen 2003, Vennema 1999, Vennema 1998, Woods 2001) and by the observed viability of engineered deletion mutants lacking some or all of these genes (de Haan 2002b, Fischer 1997, Haijema 2004, Ortego 2003, Sola 2001).

The abundance of basic residues is reflected in the calculated overall isoelectric points of the N proteins, the values of which are in the range of 9.7\u201310.1. These numbers are the more significant in view of the acidic nature of the very carboxy\u2010terminal domain; pI values ranging from 4.3 to 5.5 were calculated for the terminal 45 residues (Parker and Masters, 1990).

How the minor N species arise and whether they are of particular significance for infection is unclear. They are most likely derived by proteolytic processing from the major N species. This is supported by studies from Eleouet et al. (2000), who showed the TGEV N protein to be cleaved by caspases. Caspase cleavage sites were also predicted in the carboxy terminus of several other coronavirus N proteins (Eleouet 2000, Ying 2004). These features are in agreement with observations showing that antibodies directed against the carboxy terminus of the MHV and TGEV N proteins were not reactive with the faster migrating electrophoretic forms.

Of the many potential target serines only a few are actually modified in the case of MHV (Stohlman 1979, Wilbur 1986). N protein phosphorylation does not seem to play a critical role in the regulation of virus assembly. In contrast, it has been hypothesized that dephosphorylation of the protein might facilitate disassembly during MHV cell entry (Kalicharran 1996, Mohandas 1991).",

For MHV, the N protein was found to colocalize partly with the membrane\u2010associated viral replication complexes (Denison 1999, van der Meer 1999). In addition to its cytoplasmic localization, the N proteins of IBV, MHV, and TGEV have also been demonstrated to localize to the nucleolus both in coronavirus\u2010infected cells and when expressed independently (Hiscox 2001, Wurm 2001). Putative nuclear localization signals were identified in these proteins. The IBV N protein was found to interact with nucleolar antigens, which appeared to occur more efficiently when the N protein was phosphorylated, and to affect the cell cycle (Chen et al., 2002). However, because MHV is able to replicate in enucleated cells (Brayton 1981, Wilhelmsen 1981) the nucleolar localization of the N protein does not appear an essential step during infection.",

As indicated by its intracellular localization, the N protein is a likely component of the coronavirus replication and transcription complex. Its presence is not an absolute requirement for replication and transcription because a human coronavirus (HCoV) RNA vector containing the complete pol1ab gene appeared to be functional in the absence of the N protein (Thiel et al., 2003). However, the efficiency of the system was much enhanced when the protein was present. Furthermore, using an in vitro system, it was demonstrated that antibodies to the N protein, but not those against the S and M proteins, inhibited viral RNA synthesis by 90% (Compton et al., 1987). Interactions that have been observed between the N protein and leader/TRS sequences (Baric 1988, Nelson 2000, Stohlman 1988) and between N protein and the 3\u2032 UTR (Zhou et al., 1996) suggest a role for the N protein in the discontinuous transcription process. Furthermore, the N protein was also shown to interact with cellular proteins that play a role in coronavirus RNA replication and transcription (Choi 2002, Shi 2000). In addition, the N protein was reported to function as a translational enhancer of MHV sgRNAs (Tahara et al., 1998).",

The carboxy\u2010terminal half of the protein is amphipathic, with a short hydrophilic domain at the carboxy\u2010terminal end (Fig. 4\n). In the center of the protein, directly adjacent to the third hydrophobic domain, is a stretch of eight amino acids that is well conserved (SWWSFNPE). The conservation of the overall chemical features suggests that there are rigid structural constraints on the M protein as a result of functional requirements (for a review on the M protein, see Rottier, 1995).",

            "text": "Biochemical and theoretical studies led to a topological model for the MHV M protein (Armstrong 1984, Rottier 1984, Rottier 1986), in which the polypeptide spans the lipid bilayer three times, leaving a small amino\u2010terminal domain (15\u201335 residues) in the lumen of intracellular organelles (or outside the virus), whereas the carboxy\u2010terminal half of the protein is located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (or inside the virion). The lumenal domain and the hydrophilic carboxy terminus are susceptible to protease digestion and are thus exposed. The bulk of the carboxy\u2010terminal half of the M protein is protease resistant, indicating that the amphipathic part of the protein is either folded tightly or embedded in the polar surface of the membrane. Indeed, a mutant lacking all three transmembrane domains was found to be associated with membranes (Mayer et al., 1988). The model for the disposition of the M protein in the membrane was confirmed for IBV (Cavanagh et al., 1986). Interestingly, the M protein of TGEV was shown to adopt an additional conformation. In virions about one\u2010third of the M molecules have their carboxy terminus exposed on the virus surface rather than buried inside the particle (Escors 2001a, Risco 1995). This appears to have immunological consequences (Risco et al., 1995) but the real significance of the dual topology is unclear. In MHV the M protein was found to assume only one defined membrane topology (Raamsman et al., 2000).",

            "text": "The coronavirus M protein is almost invariably glycosylated in its exposed amino\u2010terminal domain. This provides the virion with a diffuse, hydrophilic cover on its outer surface. Whereas the group 1 and 3 coronaviruses and SARS\u2010CoV all contain M proteins with only N\u2010linked sugars, the M proteins of group 2 coronaviruses are O\u2010glycosylated (for a review see Rottier, 1995). An exception is MHV\u20102, the M protein of which carries both O\u2010 and N\u2010linked sugars (Yamada et al., 2000). N\u2010Glycosylation is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum by the cotranslational linkage of a large oligosaccharide structure to the polypeptide at asparagine residues within the consensus sequence NXS/T (where X is any amino acid). In contrast, mucin\u2010type O\u2010glycosylation starts posttranslationally with the addition of an N\u2010acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) monosaccharide to a hydroxylamino acid. O\u2010Glycosylation is subsequently completed by stepwise addition of other monosaccharides such as galactose, N\u2010acetylglucosamine, fucose, and sialic acid. MHV M proteins carry a well\u2010conserved SS(X)TTXXP sequence at their extreme amino terminus. Despite the apparent presence of multiple hydroxylamino acids as potential oligosaccharide acceptor sites the M protein of MHV\u2010A59 was found to be modified by the addition of only a single oligosaccharide side chain (de Haan et al., 1998b). This side chain, when studied in OST7\u20101 cells, appeared to be attached to the threonine at position 5. Mutation studies, however, revealed that alternative acceptor sites can also be used. No unique sequence motifs for O\u2010glycosylation of MHV M could be identified, which is probably related to the occurrence in cells of multiple GalNAc transferases (de Haan et al., 1998b). As the expression of these enzymes varies in cells, conservation of the SS(X)TTXXP motif in MHV M protein may serve to increase opportunities for the protein to become glycosylated in different cell types.",

            "text": "The distinct conservation of N\u2010 and O\u2010glycosylation among the M proteins of the different groups of coronaviruses suggests that the presence and the particular type of carbohydrates are somehow beneficial to the virus, most likely in its interaction with the host. Glycosylation of the M protein appeared not to be required for envelope assembly (de Haan et al., 1998a,) or for interaction with the S protein (de Haan et al., 1999), nor did it influence virus replication in vitro (de Haan 2002a, de Haan 2003, Laude 1992). Coronaviruses are able to induce interferon \u03b1 (IFN\u2010\u03b1) by their glycoproteins (Baudoux 1998a, Baudoux 1998b). For TGEV (Charley 1988, Laude 1992) and MHV (de Haan et al., 2003), the oligosaccharides linked to the M protein were demonstrated to be important for efficient IFN induction in vitro. The glycosylation status of the MHV M protein was found to influence the ability of the virus to replicate in the liver but not in the brain (de Haan et al., 2003). Thus, viruses with N\u2010glycosylated M proteins replicated to a significantly higher extent in liver than otherwise identical viruses carrying O\u2010glycosylated M proteins. MHV with unglycosylated M proteins replicated to the lowest extent. The mechanism behind these observations remains to be elucidated.",

            "text": "When expressed in cells independently from the other viral proteins, the M proteins of MHV, IBV, TGEV, and feline coronavirus (FCoV) accumulate in the Golgi compartment, that is, beyond the site of virus budding (Klumperman 1994, Locker 1992, Machamer 1987, Machamer 1990, Rottier 1987), which is the intermediate compartment between the ER and the Golgi (ERGIC). The fine localization of the different proteins is, however, not the same. For instance, whereas the MHV M protein is concentrated in the trans\u2010most Golgi compartments, the IBV M protein localizes to the cis side of the Golgi complex. Signals for localization appear to reside in the hydrophilic part of the cytoplasmic tail and in the transmembrane domains. The extreme carboxy\u2010terminal tail of MHV M was shown to be necessary, although not sufficient, for Golgi localization (Armstrong 1991, Locker 1994). Mutant proteins lacking this domain were transported to the plasma membrane. Also, mutation of a single tyrosine in this domain, which occurs in the context of a potential internalization signal, resulted in plasma membrane localization (C. A. M. de Haan and P. J. M. Rottier, unpublished results). The first transmembrane domain of the IBV M protein was shown to be required and sufficient for localization to the cis\u2010Golgi region (Machamer 1987, Machamer 1990, Machamer 1993, Swift 1991). This is not the case for the MHV M protein of which mutants with only the first transmembrane domain did not leave the ER (Armstrong 1990, Locker 1994, Rottier 1990). Moreover, insertion of the first transmembrane domain of MHV M into a reporter protein resulted in a chimeric protein that was transported to the cell surface (Armstrong 1991, Machamer 1993), unlike a similar chimeric protein containing the first transmembrane domain of IBV that was retained in the Golgi compartment (Machamer et al., 1993). Other MHV M mutant proteins lacking the first and second transmembrane domains were also not efficiently retained in the Golgi compartment and were diverted to endosomal structures (Armstrong 1990, Locker 1994). The mechanism by which Golgi retention of M proteins is regulated has not yet been resolved. However, oligomerization of the proteins, mediated by the transmembrane domains, seems to play an important role, perhaps in combination with retrieval mechanisms (de Haan 2000, Maceyka 1997). Formation of oligomeric complexes has been demonstrated to correlate with Golgi retention of a reporter protein containing the first transmembrane domain of IBV M (Weisz et al., 1993) while also the Golgi\u2010resident MHV M protein was found to occur in large, homomeric complexes (Locker et al., 1995). The lumenal domain of the M protein does not appear to contribute to localization; its deletion from MHV M did not affect the intracellular destination of the protein (Mayer 1988, Rottier 1990).",

Although the primary structures of E proteins are quite conserved within the different coronavirus groups, they share little homology between the groups. However, the proteins have several structural features in common. The E protein contains a relatively large hydrophobic region in its amino\u2010terminal half, followed by a cysteine\u2010rich region, an absolutely conserved proline residue, and a hydrophilic tail. E is an integral membrane protein, which is assembled in membranes without the involvement of a cleaved signal peptide (Raamsman et al., 2000). Its membrane topology has not been firmly established. Although the opposite was proposed initially for the TGEV E protein (Godet et al., 1992), there seems to be consensus about the hydrophilic carboxy terminus being exposed on the cytoplasmic side in cells or on the inside of the virion (Corse 2000, Raamsman 2000). The amino terminus of the MHV E protein was not detectably present on the virion outside (Raamsman et al., 2000) but appeared to be exposed cytoplasmically when it was extended with an amino\u2010terminal epitope tag (Maeda et al., 2001), consistent with a topological model in which the hydrophobic domain spans the bilayer twice. For the IBV E protein evidence was provided indicating that the amino terminus is exposed lumenally in cells, consistent with a single spanning topology (Corse and Machamer, 2000) (Fig. 4).",

Mutagenesis revealed that one or both of the two conserved cysteines became modified.

When expressed exogenously from cDNA, the E protein was detected only in intracellular organelles, although at different locations. The MHV E protein localized to pre\u2010Golgi membrane compartments, as was demonstrated by its colocalization with rab\u20101, a marker for the endoplasmic reticulum and the ERGIC, by electron microscopy (Raamsman et al., 2000). The IBV E protein, tagged at its amino terminus with an epitope, was also localized to pre\u2010Golgi compartments (Lim and Liu, 2001). In another study, however, the IBV E protein was shown to accumulate in the Golgi apparatus, being distributed throughout the complex (Corse 2000, Corse 2002). While the former study identified an ER\u2010targeting signal in the extreme carboxy terminus of the E protein (Lim and Liu, 2001), the latter studies, using carboxy\u2010terminal truncations, mapped the Golgi\u2010targeting information to a region between tail residues 13 and 63 (Corse and Machamer, 2002). In addition, these authors showed the IBV E cytoplasmic tail to be necessary and sufficient for Golgi targeting.",

Because of its low abundance the E protein may not have a genuine structural function in the virion envelope. Rather, it may have a morphogenetic function by taking strategic positions within the M protein lattice to generate the required membrane curvature. Alternatively, it may serve to close the neck of the budding particle as it pinches off the membrane (Vennema et al., 1996). Expression of the E protein alone induced the formation of characteristic membrane structures also observed in infected cells, which apparently consist of masses of tubular, smooth convoluted membranes (David\u2010Ferreira 1965, Raamsman 2000). In addition, it resulted in the formation of vesicles containing the E protein, shown to be released from the cells (Corse 2000, Maeda 1999).",

Cotranslational N\u2010glycosylation is an essential requirement for proper folding, oligomerization, and transport of the S protein, as has also been shown for other (viral) glycoproteins (Doms et al., 1993). Growth of coronaviruses in the presence of tunicamycin resulted in the production of spikeless, noninfectious particles (Holmes 1981, Mounir 1992, Rottier 1981a, Stern 1982). These particles were devoid of S protein, which was found to aggregate in the endoplasmic reticulum when glycosylation was inhibited (Delmas and Laude, 1990).",

            "text": "Folding of the S protein is a relatively slow process. Besides the addition of oligosaccharides it involves the formation and rearrangement of many intramolecular disulfide bonds. For the S protein of MHV\u2010A59, the lumenal domain of which contains 42 cysteine residues, the major conformational events appear to take about 20 min during which the protein passes through a continuous spectrum of folding intermediates (Opstelten et al., 1993a). Folding of S is probably the rate\u2010limiting step in the process of oligomerization. Sufficiently folded S protein monomers associate in the endoplasmic reticulum to form trimers (Delmas 1990, Lin 2004), with a half\u2010time of approximately 1 h (Delmas 1990, Vennema 1990a, Vennema 1990b). Trimerization is likely to be required for export out of the endoplasmic reticulum. In infected cells S protein trimers interact with M protein (Opstelten et al., 1995) and perhaps also with E protein, and migrate to the virus assembly site. A fraction of the S protein is transported to the plasma membrane where it can cause cell\u2013cell fusion, a feature formally attributed to the S protein by its individual expression in cells (de Groot 1989, Pfleiderer 1990). Under such expression conditions the bulk of the S protein remains intracellularly (Vennema et al., 1990a) in the endoplasmic reticulum (Opstelten et al., 1995). Retrieval signals have been identified in the cytoplasmic tail of the S proteins from coronavirus groups 1 and 3 as well as in the tail of the SARS\u2010CoV S protein, but not in the group 1 MHV S protein (Lontok et al., 2004).",

The MHV S protein was shown to become palmitoylated, a modification that may already take place in the endoplasmic reticulum (van Berlo et al., 1987). As a late step the S protein can be cleaved. A basic amino acid sequence resembling the furin consensus sequence motif (RXR/KR) occurs approximately in the middle of the protein and was shown to be the target of a furin\u2010like enzyme in the case of MHV\u2010A59 (de Haan et al., 2004). Cleavage has been demonstrated for S proteins from coronavirus groups 2 and 3, but not for S proteins from group 1 viruses (Cavanagh, 1995) or from SARS\u2010CoV (Bisht et al., 2004). The resulting amino\u2010terminal S1 subunit and the membrane\u2010anchored S2 subunit remain noncovalently linked.

            "text": "The interaction between the S protein and its receptor is the major determinant for virus entry and host range restriction. Nonpermissive cell lines can be rendered susceptible by making them express the receptor (see later references). Coronaviruses can also be retargeted to specific cells by exchanging the ectodomain of the S protein for that of an appropriate other coronavirus, as was demonstrated for MHV (Kuo et al., 2000) and FIPV (Haijema et al., 2003). Receptors have so far been identified for the group 2 coronavirus MHV (CEACAM; Dveksler 1991, Dveksler 1993, Williams 1991); the group 1 coronaviruses TGEV and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV) (pAPN; Delmas 1992, Delmas 1993), FIPV (fAPN; Tresnan et al., 1996), and HCoV\u2010229E (hAPN; Yeager et al., 1992); and for SARS\u2010CoV (ACE2; Li et al., 2003). The S proteins of the group 2 coronaviruses have been observed to exhibit hemagglutinating activities. Although for bovine coronavirus (BCoV), HCoV\u2010OC43, and hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV) 9\u2010O\u2010acetylated sialic acids were identified as a receptor determinant (Krempl 1995, Kunkel 1993, Schultze 1992, Schultze 1991a, Vlasak 1988b), specific receptors for these viruses have not been identified. Also, the MHV S protein appears to bind sialic acid derivatives in addition to its specific receptor CEACAM, which may suggest that sialic acids function as an additional receptor determinant for MHV\u2010like coronaviruses (Wurzer et al., 2002).",

            "text": "The ectodomain of the S2 subunit, which is involved in the fusion process, contains two heptad repeat (HR) regions (de Groot 1987a, de Groot 1987b), a sequence motif characteristic of coiled coils. Mutations in the first (i.e., membrane\u2010distal) HR region of the MHV S protein resulted in fusion\u2010negative phenotypes (Luo and Weiss, 1998) or in a low\u2010pH dependence for fusion (Gallagher et al., 1991), whereas mutations in the second HR region caused defects in S protein oligomerization and fusion ability (Luo et al., 1999). A fusion peptide has not yet been identified in any of the coronavirus spike proteins, but is predicted to be located at (Bosch 2004b, Chambers 1990) or within (Luo and Weiss, 1998) the amino terminus of the first HR region. Binding of the S1 subunit to the (soluble) receptor, or exposure to 37\u00b0C and an elevated pH, has been shown to trigger conformational changes that are supposed to facilitate virus entry by activation of the fusion function of the S2 subunit (Breslin 2003, Gallagher 1997, Lewicki 2002, Matsuyama 2002, Miura 2004, Sturman 1990, Taguchi 2002, Zelus 2003). This conformational change is thought to lead to exposure of the fusion peptide and its interaction with the target membrane, further changes resulting in the formation of a heterotrimeric six\u2010helix bundle, characteristic of class I viral fusion proteins, during the membrane fusion process. Indeed, peptides corresponding to the HR regions of MHV (Bosch 2003, Xu 2004) and SARS\u2010CoV (Bosch 2004b, Ingallinella 2004, Liu 2004, Tripet 2004, Zhu 2004) were found to assemble into stable oligomeric complexes in an antiparallel manner, which in the natural situation would result in the close colocation of the fusion peptide and the transmembrane domain. These peptides were further shown to be inhibitors for viral entry (Bosch 2003, Bosch 2004b, Liu 2004, Yuan 2004, Zhu 2004).",

The function of this domain is unknown, but a similar region in the HIV\u20101 Env protein was demonstrated to be important for viral fusion and Env incorporation into virions (Salzwedel et al., 1999). Immediately downstream of the transmembrane domain all S proteins contain a cysteine\u2010rich region (de Groot et al., 1987a). Using a mutational approach including deletions, insertions, and substitutions, both the transmembrane domain and the cysteine\u2010rich region immediately downstream thereof, but not the carboxy\u2010terminal part of the cytoplasmic tail, were shown to be important for MHV S protein\u2010induced cell\u2013cell fusion (Bos 1995, Chang 2001, Chang 2000) (B.

            "text": "The cleavage requirements of the S proteins for the biological activities of the coronavirus spike remain enigmatic. Whereas the S proteins of group 1 coronaviruses, such as FIPV (Vennema et al., 1990a), are not cleaved, those of other coronaviruses, particularly of groups 2 and 3, are cleaved to variable extents, depending on the viral strain and the cell type in which the viruses are grown (Frana et al., 1985; reviewed by Cavanagh, 1995). Cleavage of the S proteins is not required to expose the internal fusion peptide. Whereas cleavage of the MHV S protein generally correlates strongly with cell\u2013cell fusion (Cavanagh, 1995), virus\u2013cell fusion appeared not to be affected by preventing S protein cleavage, indicating that these fusion events have different requirements (de Haan et al., 2004). Similarly, whereas trypsin activation of SARS\u2010CoV S protein was required for cell\u2013cell fusion, it did not enhance the infectivity of cell\u2010free pseudovirions (Simmons et al., 2004). For MHV\u20104, the spikes of which are able to initiate fusion without prior interaction with the primary MHV receptor (Gallagher et al., 1992), the stability of the S1\u2013S2 heterodimers after S protein cleavage is low, allowing receptor\u2010independent fusion. During cell culture adaptation, however, selected mutant viruses carried deletions in the S1 subunit, downstream of the receptor\u2010binding domain, which resulted in stabilized S1\u2013S2 heterodimers and receptor\u2010dependent fusion activity (Krueger et al., 2001).",

The ectodomain contains 8\u201310 putative N\u2010linked glycosylation sites. The putative esterase active site (FGDS) is located near the (signal\u2010cleaved) HE amino terminus. The coronavirus HE protein has 30% amino acid identity with the HE\u20101 subunit of the HE fusion protein of influenza C virus and the HE protein of torovirus (Cornelissen et al., 1997). It has been suggested that coronaviruses have captured their HE module from influenza C virus or a related virus (Luytjes et al., 1988). However, influenza C virus, toroviruses, and coronaviruses may well have acquired their HE sequences independently, not from each other but from yet another source (Cornelissen et al., 1997). The HE protein becomes cotranslationally N\u2010glycosylated when expressed in cells, giving rise to a polypeptide of approximately 60\u201365 kDa that rapidly forms disulfide\u2010linked dimers (Hogue 1989, Kienzle 1990, King 1985, Parker 1989, Yokomori 1989, Yoo 1992). The HE dimers (or a higher order structure thereof) become incorporated into virions, while a proportion is transported to the cell surface (Kienzle 1990, Pfleiderer 1991).",

While the HE proteins of BCoV, HEV, and HCoV\u2010OC43 hydrolyze the 9\u2010O\u2010acetyl group of sialic acid and therefore appear to function as receptor\u2010destroying enzymes (Schultze 1991b, Vlasak 1988a), the HE proteins of MHV\u2010like coronaviruses function as sialate\u20104\u2010O\u2010acetylesterases (Klausegger 1999, Regl 1999, Wurzer 2002). Although inhibition of the esterase activity of BCoV resulted in a 100\u2010 to 400\u2010fold reduction in viral infectivity (Vlasak et al., 1988a), it was shown both for BCoV and for an MHV strain expressing an HE gene that the S protein is required and sufficient for infection (Gagneten 1995, Popova 2002). In view of these results it has been proposed that the HE protein might play a role at an even earlier step and may mediate viral adherence to the intestinal wall through the specific yet reversible binding to mucopolysaccharides. The process of binding to sialic acid receptors followed by cleavage and rebinding to intact receptors could theoretically result in virus motility and even allow migration through the mucus layer covering the epithelial target cells in the respiratory and enteric tracts (Cornelissen et al., 1997).",

Furthermore, intracerebral expression of the HE protein in mice was found to affect the neuropathogenicity of MHV (Yokomori 1995, Zhang 1998).

Smaller particles, with the characteristic morphology of extracellular virions, that is, having a compact, dense inner core with polygonal contours, were seen to accumulate in secretory vesicles in the periphery of the infected cell. Both types of particles appeared to coexist in the Golgi complex (Fig. 5\n). Obviously, the larger particles are the precursors of the smaller mature virions (Salanueva et al., 1999) and probably undergo their morphological maturation during their transport through the Golgi complex. The reorganization of the particle gives rise to the supposedly icosahedral core shell and is accompanied by a dramatic, approximately 50% reduction of the particle volume.",

As virions encounter an increasingly acidic pH on passage through the Golgi stack, studies addressing this parameter were done with lysosomotropic agents. Thus, chloroquine and NH4Cl were applied to MHV\u2010infected cells to elevate the pH at the trans side of the Golgi complex, but no effect on the maturation of MHV was observed (Tooze et al., 1987). Monensin, a drug that reversibly disorganizes the Golgi complex and blocks transport along the exocytic pathway, led to the accumulation of the large, annular TGEV virions; after reversal of the blockade formation of the small, compact particles was again restored (Salanueva et al., 1999). These observations confirm that the Golgi complex is necessary for TGEV structural transformation. Nocodazole treatment of cells causes a reversible fragmentation of the Golgi complex. Under these conditions TGEV virions were still able to undergo normal structural maturation. In contrast, still another Golgi\u2010disrupting compound, brefeldin A, prevented their maturation (Risco et al., 1998). This compound leads to a redistribution of Golgi membranes to the ER, leaving no definable Golgi system. Interestingly, MHV particles accumulated in infected cells under these conditions appeared to be infectious when liberated by sonication (J. Meertens and P. J. M. Rottier, unpublished results), leaving us with an intriguing question about the function of the maturation process.",

The higher temperature was found to cause a conformational change in the M protein, leading to its aggregation and association with the viral RNA in the nucleocapsid.

The location where these nucleocapsids are assembled has not been defined. Their production may take place either free in the cytoplasm, where the N protein is synthesized, or, alternatively, in association with the membrane\u2010bound structures where genomic RNA is produced. The observed colocalization of N protein with the replication complexes (Bost 2000, Bost 2001, Denison 1999, van der Meer 1999) is consistent with the latter possibility. Coronavirus replication appears to occur on double\u2010membrane vesicles (Gosert et al., 2002), which utilize components of the cellular autophagy pathway (Prentice et al., 2004). Whereas early in infection the replication complexes were shown to be almost entirely discrete from sites of M protein accumulation, at later times of infection helicase and N proteins appeared to colocalize with the M protein (Bost 2000, Bost 2001). It was proposed that the translocation of helicase\u2013N protein complexes to sites of virus assembly may serve as a mechanism to deliver the newly synthesized RNA and nucleocapsids and to facilitate the retention of the M protein in the intermediate compartment.",

Within this area a stable stem\u2013loop of 69 nucleotides was predicted. Mutation studies revealed that the integrity of this secondary structure was important and that the sequence of the packaging signal could be trimmed further to a minimum stretch of 61 nucleotides (Fosmire et al., 1992). The signal appeared to be sufficient for RNA packaging as its inclusion allowed a synthetic subgenomic mRNA of MHV\u2010A59 to be packaged specifically; the encapsidation efficiency of the mRNA was, however, significantly lower than that of the defective genomic RNA from which it was transcribed (Bos et al., 1997).

Somewhat similar conclusions could be drawn from a study with TGEV (Izeta et al., 1999). By comparing packaging efficiencies of different defective genomes it was inferred that information for packaging was present both at the genomic 5\u2032 end (about 1.0 kb) and in parts of pol1b. A packaging signal was subsequently mapped to a fragment representing the 5\u2032 terminal 649 nucleotides of the genome by inserting a series of overlapping segments covering a stretch of about 2300 nucleotides from the 5\u2032 end of the genome into an mRNA reporter expression construct contained within a defective genome (Escors et al., 2003); only the 5\u2032 terminal sequence conferred to the mRNA the ability to become packaged by helper virus.",

Although the overview may suggest the existence of different cis\u2010acting signals, the data still allow a scenario in which multiple domains in the genome are involved cooperatively, each one contributing differently to (the efficiency of) the encapsidation process. Such contributions would not necessarily concern N protein binding only; the exceptional complexity of the coronaviral genome might call for additional provisions, related perhaps to the structuring of the encapsidation complex. Several observations indeed imply the involvement of multiple domains. The efficient rescue, for instance, of a BCoV defective genome (Drep) that completely lacks the putative 69\u2010nucleotide packaging signal entails the participation of additional sequence(s) (Chang 1996, Cologna 2000). Another example is the strongly increased rescue of an otherwise poorly packaged defective TGEV genome (M22) due to the presence of about 4.1 kb of sequences derived from the pol1b gene (M62) (Izeta et al., 1999).",

Specific binding to RNA transcripts containing this sequence was indeed demonstrated biochemically with MHV N protein derived from infected cells, from virions, and from cells expressing the protein (Molenkamp and Spaan, 1997). The binding efficiency, however, appeared to be relatively weak as was shown by comparing N protein binding to different parts of a packageable defective genome (MIDI\u2010C) (Cologna et al., 2000). The highest binding efficiency was observed with an RNA transcript representing about 1 kb from the 5\u2032 end of pol1a.

Using an RNA overlay protein blot assay and various in vitro RNA transcripts, the binding of N protein was localized to a stretch of nucleotides (nucleotides 56\u201365) at the 3\u2032 end of the leader (Stohlman et al., 1988). The stretch included the pentanucleotide repeat UCUAA now known to be critical for transcription. Biochemical analyses of the interaction measured a dissociation constant (K\nd) of 14 nM for bacterially expressed MHV N protein to the leader RNA (Nelson et al., 2000). Consistent with the presence of a leader at the 5\u2032 end of all viral RNAs, an N protein\u2010specific monoclonal antibody coimmunoprecipitated genomic RNA as well as the subgenomic RNAs from MHV\u2010infected cells (Baric et al., 1988). Similar observations were made for BCoV (Cologna et al., 2000). Packaging of subgenomic RNAs has been reported for TGEV (Sethna et al., 1991), BCoV (Hofmann et al., 1990), and IBV (Zhao et al., 1993) but not for MHV, suggesting that their incorporation is not mediated by N protein\u2013leader interaction. Whereas for TGEV and IBV the relative packaging of subgenomic RNAs was found to be inefficient, genomic RNA appearing in virions at a more than 10\u2010fold molar excess over any subgenomic RNA species, the BCoV subgenomic N and M mRNAs appeared to be packaged as abundantly as the genome (Hofmann et al., 1990). A reevaluation for TGEV revealed that the detection of subgenomic RNAs in virions was related to the purity of virus preparations, indicating that mRNAs were not specifically encapsidated (Escors et al., 2003).",

They appear to bind RNA both nonspecifically (Masters 1992, Robbins 1986) and in a sequence\u2010specific way (Cologna 2000, Nelson 1993, Nelson 2000, Stohlman 1992). Non\u2010sequence\u2010specific RNA binding has been mapped to a large central domain of the MHV N molecule (Fig. 6) (Masters, 1992). Also, the leader\u2010binding property was assigned to this domain; this activity was initially mapped to the area containing the two highly basic regions (Nelson and Stohlman, 1993), but was later narrowed to a 55\u2010residue segment containing the serine/arginine\u2010rich basic region (Nelson et al., 2000). Interestingly, this particular region could not be interchanged with its BCoV counterpart in a study on the functional equivalence of the N proteins from these related viruses (Peng et al., 1995b). Another domain in the MHV N protein implicated in viral RNA binding was mapped to an area that partly overlaps with the second basic region. The assignment was based on an analysis of second\u2010site revertants of MHV mutant Alb4, the virions of which are extremely thermolabile because of a 29\u2010residue deletion located between the central and carboxy\u2010terminal domain of the N protein (Koetzner et al., 1992). The reverting mutations correlated with restoration of the disturbed RNA\u2010binding capacity of the MHV N protein and were found clustered close to the basic region some 80 residues on the amino side of the deletion (Fig. 6) (Peng et al., 1995a). Although all these studies consistently attribute a major role in RNA binding to the central portion of the coronaviral N protein, the interaction of the IBV N protein with the 3\u2032 UTR of IBV RNA mentioned previously was mapped to the amino\u2010 and carboxy\u2010terminal domains of the molecule (Zhou and Collisson, 2000). 3\u2032 UTR RNA\u2010binding activity was also assigned to the amino\u2010terminal domain of the SARS\u2010CoV N protein on the basis of studies using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Huang et al., 2004).",

As there are no indications for packaging of the RNA into a preformed capsid, these interactions can be described by the following model. Packaging is initiated by binding of the N protein, either as a monomer or in a multimeric form, to the RNA. By analogy to other RNA viruses, this sequence\u2010specific interaction may induce a conformational change in the N protein, thereby creating a nucleation site for the cooperative stacking of N protein units along the entire length of the RNA, now in a non\u2010sequence\u2010specific way. These N units can again be monomeric or consist of defined multimers. Finally, helix formation is driven by interactions between N molecules separated along the ribonucleoprotein chain but that become adjacent in neighboring helices. This model predicts multiple nonequivalent interactions between N molecules.",

The results so far are inconsistent (Fig. 6), but this might as well reflect the predicted occurrence of nonequivalent interactions. Interaction sites were mapped to the amino\u2010terminal part of the MHV N protein (Wang and Zhang, 1999). Using an in vitro binding assay in which the full\u2010length N protein was incubated with bacterially expressed fusion proteins containing different segments of the N protein, interaction was observed with a polypeptide derived from the amino\u2010terminal one\u2010third (residues 1\u2013162) of the protein and with a polypeptide representing the central part (residues 163\u2013292). The latter domain contains the serine/arginine\u2010rich region implicated in the binding to the leader/TRS\u2010specific sequences (Nelson et al., 2000). This domain could not be replaced by the corresponding domain from BCoV without loss of viral viability, from which the authors indeed inferred an involvement in protein\u2013protein interactions (Peng et al., 1995b). The same domain was also shown to be essential for the homotypic association of the SARS\u2010CoV N protein (He et al., 2004). Using a mammalian two\u2010hybrid approach, the N\u2013N interaction appeared to be abolished completely when the serine/arginine\u2010rich region had been deleted. However, in another study using the yeast two\u2010hybrid system this interaction was not confirmed. A polypeptide consisting of the amino\u2010terminal two\u2010thirds of the SARS\u2010CoV N protein, that contains the serine/arginine\u2010rich region, exhibited no association with the full\u2010length protein (Surjit et al., 2004). Rather, self\u2010association was attributed to the carboxy\u2010terminal 209 residues of the molecule, which lacks the motif.",

            "text": "Unlike most other enveloped viruses, coronaviruses have the remarkable feature of being able to independently assemble their envelope. Indications for this were already noticed in early electron microscopy studies of viral preparations and infected cells showing the occurrence of apparently \u201cempty\u201d particles (Afzelius 1994, Chasey 1976). Incomplete virions with the typical coronavirus morphology but lacking the N protein and the genome could indeed be separated from normal IBV particles by their lower density in sucrose gradients (Macnaughton and Davies, 1980). The definition of virus\u2010like particles (VLPs) and the requirements for their formation were established by the coexpression of the coronaviral structural proteins in mammalian cells (Vennema et al., 1996). Membranous particles were assembled when the MHV envelope proteins M, E, and S were coexpressed, without the need for an N protein or genomic RNA. The particles were released from the cells and, when examined under the electron microscope, appeared to be morphologically indistinguishable from authentic virions, that is, they had the characteristic shape and dimensions of normal virions. Also, their membrane protein composition was similar to that of MHV, with a high abundance of M protein and only trace amounts of E protein. Quite surprisingly, only the M and E proteins were required for particle assembly. Both S and N proteins were dispensable for particle formation but, whereas the S protein became incorporated when present, this was not the case for the N protein (Vennema et al., 1996), except in combination with (defective) genomic RNA, in which case a nucleocapsid was coassembled (Bos 1996, Kim 1997). Individual expression of the M or the E protein in cells did not give rise to formation of VLPs although E protein synthesis by itself led to the secretion of E\u2010containing vesicles (Corse 2000, Maeda 1999). The nature of these particles has not been characterized in much detail; the vesicles induced by MHV E sedimented slightly slower than virions (Maeda et al., 1999) whereas the particles obtained with IBV E had about the same density as virions (Corse and Machamer, 2000).",

The observations demonstrate the unique budding mechanism of coronaviruses, which is dependent solely on the envelope proteins M and E but independent of a nucleocapsid. Somewhat similar observations have been described for the flavivirus tick\u2010borne encephalitis virus and for hepatitis B virus, which also produce proteolipid particles on expression of their envelope proteins preM and E (Allison 1995, Mason 1991) and S (Patzer 1986, Simon 1988), respectively, but these particles are much smaller than the corresponding virions. In contrast, particles with the typical, large size of coronaviruses are acquired by the concerted action of just the proteins M and E (Baudoux 1998b, Vennema 1996). Budding of enveloped viruses generally requires a nucleocapsid (for a review see Garoff et al., 1998). For retroviruses the Gag protein, the precursor to the nucleocapsid, is all that is needed to obtain particles resembling immature virions; the Env protein is dispensable. Budding of alphaviruses, on the other hand, requires both the envelope proteins and the nucleocapsid. Interestingly, the same appears to hold true for arteriviruses (R. Wieringa, A. A. F. de Vries, and P. J. M. Rottier, unpublished observations), which are closely related to the coronaviruses, share with them a triple\u2010spanning envelope protein, and bud into early membranes of the secretory pathway, like coronaviruses but unlike alphaviruses.",

            "text": "It is unknown how the coronavirus M and E proteins cooperate in budding. As the extensive electron microscopy work with M proteins from various coronaviruses gave no indications that this protein causes membrane bulging by itself, it is believed that the function of the E protein in coronavirus budding is in the induction of curvature in the M protein lattice (see later) and the subsequent budding of the membrane (Vennema et al., 1996). By its low abundance in the virion, the E protein does not seem to serve a genuine structural function in that it occupies frequent, regular positions in the M protein framework. Consistent with an important role of the E protein in particle morphogenesis, mutations in its hydrophilic carboxy\u2010terminal part, introduced by targeted recombination into the MHV genome, yielded thermolabile viruses one of which showed aberrant virion morphology with pinched and elongated shapes when viewed in the electron microscope (Fischer et al., 1998). Revertant analyses revealed that a single second\u2010site amino acid change within the E protein was able to reverse the phenotypic effect of the original mutations, providing support for possible interactions between E protein monomers during budding (Fischer et al., 1998). Unexpectedly, complete deletion of the E gene from the coronaviral genome does not abolish virion formation, demonstrating that the protein is not essential for budding. Whereas this deletion dramatically (at least 1000\u2010fold) reduced the release of infectivity from infected cells in the case of MHV\u2010A59 (Kuo and Masters, 2003), knockout of the TGEV E gene resulted in a lethal phenotype (Curtis 2002, Ortego 2002). Remarkably, however, in the latter case virions still assembled but these appeared to be unable to leave the cells (J. Ortego and L. Enjuanes, personal communication).",

It was thus used to analyze the primary structure requirements of the M and E proteins for particle formation. For the M protein such studies demonstrated each of its different domains to be important. In general, mutations (deletions, insertions, and point mutations) in the lumenal domain, the transmembrane domains, the amphiphilic domain, or the carboxy\u2010terminal domain of the MHV M protein strongly affected its ability to form VLPs (de Haan et al., 1998a). The assembly process was particularly sensitive to changes in the carboxy terminus of the protein. Truncation by only one residue reduced the efficiency severely whereas removal of two residues fully abolished particle formation. These effects appeared to be less severe in the context of a normal coronaviral infection, probably because additional interactions can compensate. The single\u2010residue deletion, when introduced into the MHV genome, was without measurable phenotype and also a mutant virus with a truncation of two residues could be obtained, although with difficulty, as it was severely affected in its growth (de Haan 1998a, Kuo 2002). The importance of the M protein cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains was confirmed by VLP studies in the IBV system; mutant proteins lacking portions of either of these domains were unable to support particle assembly (Corse and Machamer, 2003).",

Deletion of the transmembrane, but not the amino\u2010terminal, domain rendered the E protein essentially assembly incompetent (Lim and Liu, 2001).

In both studies chimeric M and E proteins were also tested, demonstrating that, except in one case, exchanges between corresponding domains rendered the proteins assembly incompetent.

In MHV\u2010based VLPs generated by coexpression of M and E proteins, for instance, the sheer excess of M protein\u2014the relative molar presence of E in the particles is less than 1%\u2014is evidence for the strong interactive forces between M molecules. Hence, envelope assembly is thought to be driven primarily by laterally interacting M molecules that form a two\u2010dimensional lattice in intracellular membranes (Opstelten 1993b, Opstelten 1995). Large multimeric complexes of M protein have indeed been demonstrated biochemically after individual expression of the MHV protein in cells. When the association of the M molecules was maintained by the careful selection of cell lysis conditions, sucrose gradient analysis revealed the existence of large heterogeneous (up to about 40 molecules) complexes, which accumulated in the Golgi compartment (Locker et al., 1995). Somewhat smaller complexes were obtained when the cytoplasmic tail of the protein was removed; these complexes were no longer retained in the Golgi apparatus but transported to the cell surface. Apparently, the tail domain is not essential for the lateral interactions between M proteins, but it is critically required for budding (de Haan 1998a, de Haan 2000). Similar higher order complexes of the M protein have also been demonstrated in MHV\u2010infected cells as well as in MHV virions (Opstelten 1993b, Opstelten 1995).",

In these studies MHV M proteins with deletions in either the transmembrane regions, the amphipathic domain, or the extreme carboxy terminus or with substitutions of the lumenal domain were tested for their ability to associate with other M proteins and to be rescued into VLPs formed by assembly\u2010competent M proteins (de Haan 1998a, de Haan 2000). It appeared that the mutant proteins maintained these biological activities despite the often severe alterations; actually, the only mutant protein that had lost these abilities was one in which all three transmembrane domains had been replaced by a heterologous transmembrane domain. It was concluded that M protein molecules interact with each other through multiple contact sites, particularly at the transmembrane level. It was furthermore hypothesized that the full complement of interactions between the M molecules is required for efficient particle formation; possibly, all these interactions are required to provide the free energy to generate and stabilize the budding envelope. The failure of M protein mutants capable of associating with assembly\u2010competent M protein to assemble into VLPs by themselves (de Haan 1998a, de Haan 2000) indicates that additional interactions with viral (E) and/or host proteins is required. In this respect it is of note that the IFN\u2010inducing capacity of the M protein, demonstrated for TGEV and BCoV, also requires the presence of the E protein, which suggests that the induction of IFN is dependent on a specific, probably regularly organized structure of the M protein (Baudoux 1998a, Rottier 1981a). It is unclear how the presence of the E protein alters the M protein lattice to achieve this effect.",

This effect is due to their different rates of folding and oligomerization. For the S protein these rates are low, involving the formation of multiple intramolecular disulfide bonds and the addition of numerous oligosaccharide side chains (Delmas 1990, Opstelten 1993a, Vennema 1990a, Vennema 1990b). In contrast, folding of the MHV and BCoV M proteins is independent of disulfide bonds and glycosylation, as a result of which they are, for instance, swiftly transported out of the endoplasmic reticulum (Opstelten et al., 1993a). As a consequence, M molecules enter into M\u2013S and M\u2013HE complexes immediately after their synthesis whereas for newly synthesized S and HE molecules it took 15\u201030 min before they started to appear in these heterocomplexes (Nguyen 1997, Opstelten 1995). The importance of folding as a major rate\u2010limiting step was illustrated by the inability of the S protein to interact with M protein when its folding had been inhibited by in vivo reduction; only completely oxidized S molecules were association competent (Opstelten 1993a, Opstelten 1995). Whether the M protein interacts with S and HE proteins while they are still in their monomeric form or only after their oligomerization remains to be elucidated. It is, however, clear that the proteins engage in interaction with each other in early compartments, most likely the endoplasmic reticulum, as judged from the oligosaccharide maturation states of freshly formed protein complexes (de Haan 1999, Nguyen 1997, Opstelten 1995). Only dimers of HE were associated with HE\u2013M\u2013S complexes that were observed in BCoV\u2010infected cells; because the appearance of HE in these complexes correlated with the kinetics of HE dimerization it was concluded that proper oligomerization is most likely a requirement for its association (Nguyen and Hogue, 1997). Interestingly, such heterotrimeric complexes were not observed on coexpression of the three proteins in cells. Under these conditions only the heterodimeric M\u2013S and M\u2013HE associations were detected.",

These proteins, which seemed biologically fit as they were still fusion active, were initially tested in coexpression studies with the M and E proteins from either virus for their ability to be incorporated into VLPs. They were found to assemble only into viral particles of the species from which their carboxy\u2010terminal domain originated (Godeke et al., 2000). The chimeric S genes were subsequently incorporated into the proper coronavirus genomic background, creating the chimeric viruses fMHV and mFIPV, the spike ectodomains of which are from the feline and murine coronavirus, respectively; these studies provided the basis for the development of a novel targeted recombination system for reverse genetics of coronaviruses (Haijema 2003, Kuo 2000).",

J. M. Rottier, unpublished results). The significance of the tail domain was demonstrated most convincingly by showing the coimmunoprecipitation and VLP assembly of a chimeric VSV G protein the cytoplasmic tail of which had been replaced by that of MHV S. Tail truncations were tolerated in the context of the coronavirus; recombinant MHVs were generated that lacked 12 or 25 (but not 35) residues from the S protein carboxy terminus, but their growth was impaired by about 10\u2010 and 104\u2010fold, respectively. Also, tail extensions were tolerated, allowing the construction of a recombinant MHV with a spike protein extended at its carboxy terminus by the green fluorescent protein (GFP), yielding green fluorescent virions (Bosch et al., 2004a). The extension was, however, lost quite rapidly on serial passaging of the virus.",

The M protein has been shown to remain associated with subviral particles obtained after treatment of virions with detergent that removes the spikes (Escors 2001a, Escors 2001b, Garwes 1976, Lancer 1980, Wege 1979). The association was shown for MHV to be temperature dependent (Sturman et al., 1980). In the case of TGEV the association of M with the spherical structure, termed the core, was stabilized by basic pH and divalent cations but lost at high salt concentration, resulting in disruption of the core structure and release of the helical nucleocapsid (Escors 2001a, Escors 2001b, Risco 1996). In an elegant study of the binding of in vitro\u2010translated M polypeptides to purified nucleocapsids the ionic interaction was mapped to a 16\u2010residue sequence in the hydrophilic carboxy\u2010terminal tail domain (Escors et al., 2001b). Also in infected cells, interaction of the M protein with ribonucleoprotein structures, presumably nucleocapsids, has been demonstrated. Using M\u2010specific antibodies, structures containing both N protein and genomic RNA were coimmunoprecipitated with M protein from MHV\u2010infected cell lysates (Narayanan et al., 2000). Conversely, M protein was coprecipitated when an N\u2010specific antibody was used, while in this case all viral mRNAs copurified because of their known leader\u2010mediated affinity for the N protein. These interactions did not require an S or an E protein (Narayanan et al., 2000).",

            "text": "Although interactions between the M and N proteins might intuitively be expected to drive the process of attachment of the nucleocapsid to the intracellular target membrane, direct experimental evidence for this interaction is strikingly lacking. Significantly, MHV M and N proteins coexpressed in cells were found not to interact (Narayanan et al., 2000) nor did purified TGEV N protein interact with in vitro\u2010synthesized M protein (Escors et al., 2001b). Because the N protein occurs in coronavirus\u2010infected cells in various configurations\u2014as a free protein and in association with an array of partners including the viral genome\u2014it is obvious that a selection mechanism must act to ensure that only nucleocapsids are assembled into particles. Consistently, coexpressed N protein is not incorporated into VLPs, but its inclusion depends on the presence of viral RNA (Bos 1996, Vennema 1996). Thus, unless the selection process is performed by a mechanism not involving the N protein, its association with genomic RNA to form a nucleocapsid seems required to generate the unique conformation that enables it to interact with the M protein. The only evidence to date for an interaction between M and N proteins is indirect and comes from genetic studies. Analysis of second\u2010site revertants of a constructed MHV\u2010A59 mutant virus lacking the two carboxy\u2010terminal residues of its M protein revealed that the highly defective growth phenotype of this virus could be restored, among others, by mutations in the carboxy\u2010terminal domain of the N protein (Kuo and Masters, 2002). In two independently obtained revertants the N protein had lost 15 residues of this\u2014among different strains of MHV highly conserved\u2014domain because of a frameshifting 10\u2010nucleotide deletion. The results argue strongly for a direct cooperation of the carboxy\u2010terminal regions of the M and N proteins during virion formation. Other indications supporting the occurrence of M\u2013N interactions come from studies of complexes of M protein with ribonucleoprotein from MHV\u2010infected cells and with TGEV cores (Escors 2001b, Narayanan 2000). When such complexes were treated with RNase the association of M and N proteins was not destroyed, suggesting a direct interaction. However, the presence of short RNAs inaccessible to the RNase but sufficient to bridge the M\u2013N interaction could not be excluded.",

            "text": "The most unusual interaction that the coronaviral M protein seems to engage in involves genomic RNA. This interaction has so far been reported only for MHV, by Makino and co\u2010workers. These workers had shown earlier that the 69\u2010nucleotide packaging signal located in the pol1b gene could mediate the incorporation into virions of RNAs of even noncoronaviral origin (Woo et al., 1997). They subsequently showed that this incorporation is most likely effected by a direct and specific interaction of the signal with the M protein. When defective genomic RNAs or nonviral RNAs were introduced into helper MHV\u2010infected cells, they could subsequently be isolated as ribonucleoproteins from lysates of the cells by immunoprecipitation with an M\u2010specific antibody, but only if the RNAs contained the packaging signal (Narayanan and Makino, 2001). Coexpression experiments using noncoronaviral vectors showed the interaction to be independent of the N protein. A reporter gene transcript generated in cells expressing the M protein could be coimmunoprecipitated with an anti\u2010M monoclonal antibody provided that the RNA carried the packaging signal (Narayanan et al., 2003a). Moreover, when the E protein was additionally coexpressed, the signal\u2010containing RNA\u2014but not an identical RNA lacking this sequence\u2014was found to be coincorporated into VLPs, irrespective of the presence of the N protein. Altogether these observations reveal a hitherto unknown type of interaction between a viral envelope protein and genomic RNA. Although its significance remains to be further established the M\u2013RNA interaction seems to provide additional selectivity to the assembly of the coronaviral nucleocapsid.",

Some coronaviruses have an HE protein but continue growing well if for any reason the gene is not (properly) expressed as happens among different MHVs. Consistently, S and HE proteins are incorporated independent from each other. Direct interactions between S and HE were not observed when the proteins were coexpressed in cells (Nguyen and Hogue, 1997). This result is consistent with the idea that these proteins are separately drawn into the M protein lattice by their distinctive interactions with M molecules.

Early in infection such patches might start to form only after the envelope proteins have left the endoplasmic reticulum and become concentrated in intermediate membranes on their way to the Golgi complex. Later, when viral protein synthesis increases, this density might be reached earlier, perhaps explaining the observed late budding in the endoplasmic reticulum (Goldsmith 2004, Klumperman 1994, Tooze 1984).

Starting with nucleocapsid formation we must admit that we know practically nothing. By which interactions and where on the genome the packaging is initiated, how the wrapping of the RNA proceeds, how the condensation of the ribonucleoprotein structure takes place, and where in the cell these activities take place are all unresolved questions. Although we seem to know more about the budding process, several fundamental issues are still unresolved. Obvious issues are the site of budding and the determinants of its location, and the inclusion of the nucleocapsid into the budding particle. An intriguing issue is the budding mechanism itself: how is membrane curvature generated and, particularly, how is the directionality determined. Coronaviruses, like other intracellularly budding viruses, direct their particles out of the cytoplasm into the organelles, that is, opposite to the natural direction of cellular vesicle budding. Once again, simply nothing is known about the governing principles.",

            "text": "Fig 2: The coronavirus life cycle. The replication cycle starts with attachment of the virion by its S protein, that is, through the S1 subunit thereof, to the receptors on the host cell. This interaction leads to fusion of the virus envelope with a cellular membrane, for which the S2 subunit is responsible. From the genomic RNA that is released by disassembly of the incoming particle the pol1a and pol1b genes are translated, resulting in the production of two large precursors (Pol1a and Pol1ab), the many cleavage products of which collectively constitute the functional replication\u2013transcription complex. Genes located downstream of the pol1b gene are expressed from a 3\u2032\u2010coterminal nested set of subgenomic (sg) mRNAs, each of which additionally contains a short 5\u2032 leader sequence derived from the 5\u2032 end of the genome (shown in red). Transcription regulatory sequences (TRSs) located upstream of each gene serve as signals for the transcription of the sgRNAs. The leader sequence is joined at a TRS to all genomic sequence distal to that TRS by discontinuous transcription, most likely during the synthesis of negative\u2010strand sgRNAs. In most cases, only the 5\u2032\u2010most gene of each sgRNA is translated. Multiple copies of the N protein package the genomic RNA into a helical structure in the cytoplasm. The structural proteins S, M, and E are inserted into the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), from where they are transported to the ER\u2010to\u2010Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) to meet the nucleocapsid and assemble into particles by budding. The M protein plays a central role in this process through interactions with all viral assembly partners. It gives rise to the formation of the basic matrix of the viral envelope generated by homotypic, lateral interactions between M molecules, and it interacts with the envelope proteins E, S, and HE (if present), as well as with the nucleocapsid, thereby directing the assembly of the virion. Virions are transported through the constitutive secretory pathway out of the cell\u2014the glycoproteins on their way being modified in their sugar moieties, whereas the S proteins of some but not all coronaviruses are cleaved into two subunits by furin\u2010like enzymes (see text for references).",
