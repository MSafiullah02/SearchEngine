In endemic regions, this relapsing disease is responsible for substantial morbidity, mostly associated with recurrent bouts of fever, anaemia [3] and adverse pregnancy outcomes [4,5]. Plasmodium vivax is not generally regarded as sufficiently virulent to cause death. Notwithstanding this benign reputation, over the last two to three decades, there have been multiple case studies of fatal vivax malaria [6,7]. More recently, hospital and outpatient surveillance systems have shown that P. vivax-associated mortality may be occurring with greater frequency than previously thought or reported [8-11].",

The fatality of hospitalised patients with P. vivax parasitaemia in Timika, southern Papua, has been estimated to be similar to that of patients with P. falciparum infections (1.6% versus 2.2% respectively) [10]. In the present study we aimed to determine the extent to which P. vivax contributed to those deaths by conducting an audit of the clinical records of all patients with pure P. vivax infections who died at Mitra Masyarakat Hospital between January 2004 and September 2009.",

This facility provides treatment to all patients \u2013 free of charge for indigenous Papuan residents and at a nominal cost for non-Papuans. The hospital has 101 beds, a 24-hour emergency department, an active outpatient \u2018polyclinic\u2019, and a high care unit with facilities for intravenous infusions but not mechanical ventilation. Radiological services include X-ray and ultrasonography. Laboratory facilities are also available for haematologic and biochemical analysis and basic microscopy, but not for microbiological culture. In addition to the hospital, there is also a network of primary health clinics distributed throughout the community. An established community surveillance network covers 14 of these clinics and collects data on the total number of blood smear examinations and the number of malaria positive films read on a weekly basis.",

The point prevalence of asexual parasitaemia in the community has been estimated at 16.3% (7.7% for P. falciparum and 6.4% for P. vivax) [13]. Prior to March 2006, hospital guidelines recommended oral quinine plus a 14-day regimen of primaquine for the treatment of patients with uncomplicated vivax malaria. After 2006, quinine was switched to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHP) for all malaria species. Severe malaria was treated with intravenous quinine prior to May 2005 and intravenous artesunate thereafter.",

Slides are declared negative after review of a minimum of 100 high-power microscope fields and if parasitaemia is present the density is scored semiquantitatively as 1+ to 4+. In 2004, a random sample of 1,083 positive slides from the hospital laboratory was re-examined by an independent expert microscopist with more than 10 years of experience. The overall concordance between initial and subsequent readings was 90% (979/1083). In 1.7% (18/1,083) of the slides, the second reading was negative and in 4% (38/922) of cases, slides reported as monoinfections were, in fact, found to be mixed-species infections.

The data reviewed included 2,937 P. vivax infections and 46 deaths occurring between January 2004 and December 2007 that were included in a previous hospital-based epidemiological analysis [10]. Those diagnosed by RDT alone and those who only received a microscopic diagnosis of vivax malaria before referral to the hospital were excluded from the analysis. Data from the clinical notes were extracted by two physicians experienced in internal medicine. Information was recorded on a standardised death audit form and then entered into an EpiData database (version 3.1, EpiData Association, Odense, Denmark). The audit form documented presenting symptoms, past medical history, examination findings, laboratory and radiological investigation results, fulfilment of \u2018severity\u2019 criteria, diagnoses given during admission, treatment received and progress. If Plasmodium species identification was available from both hospital and research cross-check microscopy, the latter was taken as the best available evidence. For the purpose of study exclusion, a positive HRP2-based rapid antigen test (Paracheck Pf\u00ae, Orchid Biochemical Systems) was taken as confirmation of P. falciparum infection even if this was not detected on standard microscopy. If available, X-rays were interpreted by a certified infectious diseases specialist who was blinded to case history. Indicators of severity were only deemed to be present if the relevant criteria were fulfilled prior to the preterminal period (defined as within six hours of death).",

This was done according to strict a priori criteria based on plausible pathological mechanisms reported in the scientific literature [16] and prior clinical experience with the disease (Table 1). Any disagreements in classification of the cause(s) of death were resolved by consensus. The sole exception to the criteria was for patients who did not fulfil the rules for inclusion in Category 1 (vivax malaria as primary cause of death) but who had no plausible alternative cause of death. In these instances, vivax malaria was classified as the prime cause of death. Although well-established to occur as a result of P. vivax infection alone [16], respiratory distress was only considered to be due to vivax malaria if there was no evidence of concomitant bacterial sepsis, conservatively defined as infiltrates on chest X-ray or any deviation in white cell count from the age-adjusted normal range [17]. Diarrhoea was conservatively attributed to alternative causes. Longitudinal cohorts indicate that P. vivax infection in children results in malnutrition [18], hence severe malnutrition with two or more documented episodes of vivax malaria in the preceding 12 months, was classified as vivax malaria being a major contributor to death.",

The number of patients admitted with malaria showed a bimodal age distribution with peaks between 0 to 10 and 15 to 35 years (Figure 2).

Our previous publication based on an earlier set of surveillance data reported an overall risk of death in patients admitted with vivax malaria of 1.6%, raising significant concerns that the virulence of this organism had been underestimated [10]. In the current analysis we used a priori definitions to classify the contribution of vivax malaria to those deaths. We excluded individuals with mixed Plasmodium species infections and used conservative criteria to define potential concomitant bacterial sepsis. Our results highlight that over a six year period, a minimum of 36 deaths could be at least partially attributed to P. vivax infection and that in six cases vivax malaria was most likely the primary cause of death. This resulted in a fatality of 1 in 97 for patients admitted to hospital and 1 in 8,160 for the community as a whole. Children younger than five years old were at a two- to four-fold greater risk of death compared to those older than five years.",

In Timika, the mean reduction in haemoglobin and risk of severe anaemia is greater for infants (<1 year of age) infected with P. vivax when compared with P. falciparum and, thereafter, the haematologic impact of P. falciparum exceeds that of P. vivax, [3,21].

Chronic P. vivax infections have been implicated in a protein-wasting condition akin to kwashiorkor, in both induced [22] and natural infection [23]. Indeed, the evidence that P. vivax causes malnutrition is stronger than that for P. falciparum [24]. It is also likely that there is an epidemiological, and possibly a biological, association between malnutrition and a greater risk of P. vivax severe disease [25], as has been noted previously in patients infected with P. falciparum [26]. While this relationship is likely bidirectional, our study supports previous literature suggesting that malnutrition significantly worsens the outcome of infectious disease and implicates vivax malaria as not only a potential cause of malnutrition, but also a subsequent precipitating cause of death in those with significant malnutrition [16].",

One infant had an acute respiratory distress-type picture. Bilateral lung infiltrates consistent with acute lung injury were seen in 15% of all adult vivax-associated deaths and in a third of those who had chest X-rays. Severe anaemia and metabolic acidosis are also likely to be key determinants, particularly in children, in whom lung injury is less common than in adults.

A study in Papua New Guinea has also highlighted the importance of respiratory distress in vivax malaria, although the degree to which this was attributable to P. vivax infection, associated anaemia or comorbid pneumonia was unclear [34]. Since microbiological data were not available in our study, we conservatively regarded any deviation in white cell count or infiltrates on chest X-ray as evidence of concomitant bacterial infection. In other studies, albeit without routine blood cultures for bacteraemia, severe and fatal sepsis syndromes have been attributed to vivax malaria [35]. Given the potential for P. vivax to cause an intense inflammatory response [36] and/or lung injury/infiltrates [27] it is likely that we have significantly overestimated the contribution of infectious comorbidities and underestimated the direct contribution of vivax malaria alone to sepsis, lung injury and death. Nevertheless, our results suggest that, as with falciparum malaria, there may be a potentially fatal interaction between vivax malaria and bacterial infection, particularly pneumonia. To clarify this interaction, prospective studies of severe vivax malaria syndromes need to include systematic investigation for concomitant bacterial infection, including blood cultures [37]. Until then, our findings suggest the need for aggressive antimalarial treatment in patients with evidence of coinfection, and also indicate that mono-infected patients with vivax malaria who show signs of severe disease should be investigated and treated for associated bacterial sepsis.",
