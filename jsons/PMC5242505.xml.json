Granulocytes are rapidly recruited to sites of infection2, where they become activated and augment the resident capacity of infected tissue to kill and ultimately clear the pathogen3. These early events in the host response to infection are essential for survival and are coordinated by several families of pro-inflammatory mediators, including lipid mediators (such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes), cytokines and chemokines. These pro-inflammatory mediators have overlapping and distinct functions and ultimately induce an increase in vascular permeability and orchestrate leukocyte recruitment. This leads to the cardinal signs of tissue inflammation \u2014 namely calor, rubor, tumor, dolor and potentially functio laesa (Fig. 1).",

            "text": "Recently, a new array of molecules that function in the resolution of inflammation were elucidated and named specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs)4,5. Many of these SPMs are produced during the acute inflammatory response6, and their structure, biosynthesis and organic synthesis have been recently reviewed (see Ref. 5). Typically, acute inflammatory responses to pathogens are self-limiting, and there is a growing appreciation that SPMs have pivotal anti-inflammatory and anti-infective roles in tissue catabasis4. For effective resolution of inflammation to occur in tissues, cessation of granulocyte recruitment is required in conjunction with the recruitment and differentiation of macrophages, which help clear inflammatory cells and tissue debris to restore tissue homeostasis7. Granulocytes in the tissue undergo apoptosis during the resolution of inflammation to prevent bystander tissue injury occurring from the release of potentially toxic cellular contents8. Removal of apoptotic neutrophils prompts a switch from a pro- to an anti-inflammatory macrophage phenotype, which is a prerequisite for macrophage efferocytosis and egress via the lymphatic vessels9. Efferocytosis also leads to further production of additional SPMs that signal for restoration of vascular integrity, regeneration and/or repair of injured tissues, remission of fever by inhibition of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators and cytokines, and relief of inflammatory pain10. Together, the SPMs and these cellular events in resolution can be summarized as the newly recognized five cardinal signs of resolution (Fig. 1).",

Additional roles in these homeostatic processes for non-lipid mediators of resolution will not be covered in detail here but have been recently reviewed (see Refs 16,17,18). Cellular and molecular mechanisms for catabasis have now been determined in multiple organ systems and diseases. Here, we will primarily focus on lung infection and inflammation. The resolution responses that occur in non-pulmonary sites of infection and inflammation have recently been reviewed (see Refs 7,19,20,21). Finally, we consider how new therapeutic strategies that incorporate immunoresolvents may have the potential to synergize with antibiotics and to mitigate the growing problem of antibiotic resistance.",

Within minutes, the generation of eicosanoids (that is, prostaglandins and cysteinyl leukotrienes) from arachidonic acid (C20:4n-6) metabolism helps to direct peripheral blood neutrophils to infected sites. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and PGI2 regulate blood flow, whereas leukotriene C4 (LTC4) and LTD4 regulate vascular permeability1,23. Furthermore, neutrophils transmigrate towards chemotactic gradients of LTB4 (Ref. 24). With selected cytokines, chemokines and complement components (namely C5a and C3b), these eicosanoids induce neutrophil entry into the tissue to engulf and kill invading pathogens3,25. Early in the acute inflammatory response, the origins are laid for biosynthesis of resolution-phase mediators through lipid mediator class-switching, in which arachidonic acid metabolism switches from the production of leukotrienes to the production of lipoxins \u2014 the lead family of pro-resolving mediators26. Disruption of lipoxin formation or lipoxin receptor availability delays the resolution response27,28,29,30.",

SPMs are stereoselective, and complete stereochemical assignment for the majority of the SPMs has been established (reviewed in Ref. 31). Lipoxins are formed by transcellular biosynthesis via multiple distinct pathways. One pathway involves leukocyte-derived 5-LOX and platelet-derived 12-LOX in the vasculature32. A second pathway involves the conversion of arachidonic acid by epithelial cell-, eosinophil- or monocyte-derived 15-LOX and leukocyte-derived 5-LOX33,34. Although aspirin inhibits prostaglandin production, aspirin-mediated acetylation of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2; also known as PTGS2) leads to the conversion of arachidonic acid to 15(R)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15(R)-HETE), which can serve as a substrate for 5-LOX-mediated conversion to 15-epi-lipoxins (also known as aspirin-triggered (AT) lipoxins)35. Of note, in the absence of aspirin, 15(R)-HETE can also be produced by cytochrome P450 enzymes to act as a substrate for 15-epi-lipoxin transcellular biosynthesis36,37.",

These include resolvins, protectins and maresins (reviewed in Ref. 38) (Fig. 2). E-series and D-series resolvins are enzymatically derived from EPA and DHA, respectively. Similarly to 15-epi-lipoxins, resolvins are generated through interactions between aspirin-acetylated COX2 and LOX activities39. For example, in the vasculature, resolvin E1 (RvE1) transcellular synthesis in the presence of aspirin is notable for transformation of EPA to 18(R)-hydroxyEPA (18(R)-HEPE) by aspirin-acetylated COX2 in endothelial cells and 18(R)-HEPE conversion to RvE1 by leukocyte 5-LOX40,41. There are two major series of resolvins that are derived from DHA, namely D-series resolvins (RvD1\u2013RvD6) and their positional AT isomers (AT-RvD1\u2013RvD6)42. The D-series resolvins are enzymatically generated by 15-LOX-mediated conversion of DHA to 17(S)-hydroperoxyDHA (17(S)-HpDHA) and subsequent transformation by 5-LOX. For the AT-resolvins, DHA is initially converted by aspirin-acetylated COX2 to 17(R)-HpDHA that can also serve as a substrate for 5-LOX-mediated transformation to epimeric resolvins. Additional families of pro-resolution mediators derived from DHA have also been identified in resolving inflammatory exudates that display protective bioactivities, namely protectins and maresins43,44. At sites of inflammation, 15-LOX-derived 17(S)-HpDHA can be converted to protectin D1 (Ref. 45), and 12-LOX-derived 14(S)-HpDHA can be converted to maresin 1 (MaR1) (for a detailed review, see Ref. 31). The respiratory tract mucosa in health is enriched with DHA46, and both 17(S)-hydroxy-DHA and protectin D1 are generated in human airways47.",

High-affinity receptors have also been identified for RvE1 (namely, chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1; also known as CHEMR23))41, for RvD1 (namely, the probable G protein-coupled receptor GPR32) and for RvD2 (namely, the N-arachidonyl glycine receptor GPR18)48,49.

As a class of mediators, SPMs are partly defined by their overlapping function to limit neutrophil tissue accumulation, counter-regulate pro-inflammatory cytokines and encourage macrophage phagocytosis (Fig. 3). During efferocytosis, phagocytes generate SPMs that serve as autacoids to inhibit neutrophil activation, increase apoptotic cell expression of CC-chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) for chemokine clearance and promote bacterial killing and efferocytosis by macrophages (Table 1). In addition to phagocytes, lymphoid cells have vital roles in host defence, express SPM receptors and can serve as cellular effectors for SPMs. In this section, we highlight selected cell types with important functions in resolution and host defence that respond to SPMs.",

In this host response, there is a delicate balance between pro-inflammatory mediators, such as PGE2 and LTB4, and pro-resolving mediators, such as LXA4, that can dictate the intensity of the pathogen-mediated inflammation as well as microbial clearance. In a mouse model of M. tuberculosis infection, there is a rise in the levels of both the pro-inflammatory LTB4 and the pro-resolving LXA4 after infection, with LXA4 high levels persisting throughout the chronic infection92. In animals deficient in 5-LOX (a deficiency that leads to defective leukotriene and lipoxin production), M. tuberculosis infection is associated with enhanced survival92. Host lipoxin generation is related to M. tuberculosis strain virulence, suggesting a vital role for SPMs in modulating the host inflammatory responses to M. tuberculosis. Excessive production of either LTB4 or LXA4 can result in aberrant host responses to M. tuberculosis infection that, intriguingly, converge on dysregulated expression of TNF15. This accentuates the importance of both pro-inflammatory and pro-resolving responses for host defence and regulation of pathogen-mediated inflammation. Crucial roles for arachidonic acid metabolism in immune responses may be linked to the different infectious rates observed with human variants in the ALOX5 (encoding 5-LOX) locus93 and the LTA4H (which encodes LTA4 hydrolase, an enzyme involved in the final step of LTB4 production) locus94, which both appear to disrupt LTB4 and LXA4 production as well as altering protection against naturally occurring M. tuberculosis infection. Together, these findings suggest that a combinatorial approach to tuberculosis therapy would be most effective, including antibiotics to help endogenous mechanisms kill the microorganism and SPMs to control the host immune response.",

The host response in sepsis leads to diffuse systemic immune dysregulation that progresses rapidly, frequently resulting in shock. In Gram-negative bacteria-initiated sepsis, there appears to be a protective and potentially therapeutic role for lipid mediators. In mice with sepsis after caecal ligation and puncture, treatment with LXA4 reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while simultaneously promoting a reduction in Gram-negative bacteria loads that improved survival95,96. Resolvins also have an important protective role in sepsis models. RvD2 serves as a potent regulator of the systemic inflammatory response in sepsis14. This reduction in pro-inflammatory signals is a consequence, in part, of reduction in nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activity13,60,96. Treatment of septic mice with RvD2 leads to a profound reduction in the production of cytokines, including IL-6, IL-10 and interferon-\u03b1 (IFN\u03b1), and leukocyte infiltration to the site of infection is reduced. Of interest, control of the inflammatory response leads to an overall reduction in bacterial loads, both at the local site of insult and systemically within the blood, and an improvement in overall animal survival14. Sepsis is a disease of overwhelming infectious insult, compounded by an overly robust inflammatory response, whereby treatment with anti-inflammatory therapies potentially subjects the host to further harm. Modulation of pro-resolution responses appears to promote dampening of the inflammatory response while still allowing for adequate, and possibly improved, clearance of the bacterial infection. The ability to clear the source of infection while still limiting the immune response provides an attractive therapeutic paradigm for this disease of substantial health-care burden.",

By contrast, in the same model, later treatment with LXA4 had positive effects, allowing for adequate clearance of infection but dampening the protracted and pathological immune response, therefore enhancing survival97.

Influenza viruses are a well-suited model to understand the role of resolution mediators and the mechanisms in viral infections, as different strains of the virus elicit varied host immune responses and outcomes. In studies that compare more virulent strains of the influenza virus to less virulent strains, pro-resolving mediators inversely correlated with biological activity of the virus. More virulent strains of influenza led to suppression of lipoxins98, which is associated with enhanced viral dissemination. Protectin D1 has pivotal and multiple roles in regulating viral pathogenicity. More virulent influenza strains, such as H5N1, downregulate protectin D1 levels, and the pathogenicity of various isolates correlates inversely with levels of protectins99. In addition to host inflammatory responses, protectin D1 has direct antiviral actions on influenza; both protectin D1 and its isomer protectin DX (which is formed by LOX-mediated double oxygenation) interfere with viral RNA nuclear export machinery, thereby limiting viral replication100,101,102. Treatment of infected mice with protectin D1 improves survival (Fig. 4) even when administered as late as 48 hours after infection102, at a time when current antiviral therapies are no longer significantly effective103.",

If given early in pharmacologically large amounts, SPM regulation of the pathogen-mediated immune response may impair microbial clearance. In addition, there are now examples identified of select pathogens using local SPM production as an immune evasion and survival strategy. T. gondii is able to generate components of SPM biosynthetic pathways, resulting in local collaboration with host cells to increase lipoxin production with the consequence of a dampened immune response to T. gondi i115. Recruitment of neutrophils, lymphocytes and eosinophils to the site of infection are all decreased by this mechanism115. In addition to T. gondii, the opportunistic bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa can express a secreted LOX that can augment SPM production in the local milieu to modulate host defence116. Similarly, Candida albicans can biosynthesize RvE1 that limits IL-8-mediated neutrophil infiltration in the host, enabling colonization117.

Severe asthma is poorly responsive to existing therapies, and it is characterized by increased oxidative stress and decreased lipoxin production in the airways55,118,119. Recently, the increased oxidative stress in uncontrolled asthma was linked to decreased lipoxin levels through a compensatory increase in soluble epoxide hydrolase activity118. As a consequence of the soluble epoxide hydrolase activity, levels of 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid levels were decreased, which adversely impacted lipoxin production118, providing a biochemical mechanism for oxidative insults to disrupt lung resolution programmes. Low SPM levels in severe asthma are likely to have the functional consequence of chronic inflammation and airway hyperreactivity because airway LXA4 blunts leukotriene-mediated bronchoprovocation in humans120, and in mice stable analogues of LXA4 block airway hyperresponsiveness, mucus metaplasia and type 2 lung inflammation121,122, and accelerate resolution of the inflammatory response73.",

RvE1 targets NK cells in mouse models of asthma through the RvE1 receptor CMKLR1, promoting NK cell migration and cytotoxicity. With NK cell depletion, the pro-resolving function of RvE1 is partially impaired68. In allergic inflammation, RvE1 increases lipoxin formation, suggesting the possibility of redundant pathway effects to limit chronic inflammation. RvE1 inhibits IL-6, IL-23 and IL-17 release, thereby dampening the development and activation of TH17 cells. Similarly to RvE1, lipoxins can inhibit IL-17 production but do not inhibit IL-23, which is indicative of convergent but not overlapping signalling pathways. Of note, as mentioned above, RvE1 and LXA4 also engage distinct receptors, namely CMKLR1 and ALX, respectively73. RvD1 acts in a complementary manner, similarly promoting the resolution of eosinophil tissue accumulation and pro-inflammatory responses with a macrophage directed action to enhance allergen phagocytosis and clearance63. Similarly, protectin D1 has been shown to promote resolution of the lung inflammatory response and block airway hyperresponsiveness47. Of interest, protectin D1 regulates IL-5 and IL-13 but not IL-4 levels, suggesting that ILC2s rather than TH2 cells are likely to be a principal cellular target for protectin D1. It is notable that protectin D1 levels are decreased in exhaled breath condensates during asthma exacerbations47.",

In addition to LXA4, the acute phase reactant serum amyloid A (SAA) can also interact with ALX, and it is increased in COPD exacerbations27, which are largely caused by viral and bacterial respiratory tract infections. In acute exacerbations of COPD, levels of SAA are more than 2 log orders higher than LXA4 (Ref. 27). In sharp contrast to LXA4, when SAA engages ALX, it triggers a pro-inflammatory, neutrophil driven response.

RvD1 polarizes cigarette smoke-exposed macrophages towards the M2 pathway, resulting in enhanced phagocytosis as well as upregulated production of IL-10 (Ref. 64).

It is characterized by an overly robust inflammatory response to infection (for example, pneumonia and sepsis) or injury that fills the alveoli with oedema and pus, resulting in life-threatening respiratory failure. Many unsuccessful attempts have been made to therapeutically target an inflammatory pathway to limit this over-exuberant host response. In contrast to these anti-inflammatory strategies, a pro-resolving therapeutic strategy directed at harnessing host pro-resolving mechanisms is showing promise in preclinical model systems. Using a sterile model of ARDS from gastric acid aspiration, an important clinical risk factor for ARDS, several SPMs, including LXA4, 15-epi-LXA4, RvE1, RvD1 and MaR1, have proven effective as pharmacological agents in limiting acute lung inflammation and injury, and accelerating lung tissue catabasis13,29,59,60,135. Because SPMs engage endogenous resolution pathways, these mediators have the potential to both decrease pathogen-mediated inflammation and enhance host defence, which distinguishes SPMs from immunosuppressive agents. Early inflammation in ARDS is mediated by platelet\u2013neutrophil interactions59,136, and this interaction can lead to transcellular production of lipoxins or of the most recently discovered member of the SPM family, MaR1 (Ref. 59). Treatment with MaR1 is organ protective and limits the extent of lung inflammation. Furthermore, the timing of MaR1 production appears specific and regulated, as does the production of RvD1 (Ref. 137). Together, these findings highlight the potential roles SPMs could have in decreasing the severity and duration of ARDS and, more generally, the data support a targeted pro-resolving approach as a new therapeutic strategy for this devastating condition that is currently without available medical treatment.",

In addition, for viral host responses, SPMs lessened the severity of influenza and HSV infections102,107,108.

Counter-regulation of pathogen-mediated inflammation is an active process with specific cellular and biochemical events that are tightly regulated in health. With the identification of several families of endogenous pro-resolving mediators, their potent anti-inflammatory properties are now being determined. Distinct from immunosuppressive agents, these endogenous pro-resolving mediators generally display protective actions in host defence, including direct antimicrobial actions. There is still much to be done to more fully understand the intersection of these novel endogenous pathways in control of pathogen-mediated inflammation and the diversity of their mechanisms in microbial pathogenesis. The abundant presence of SPMs in human healthy breast milk139 suggests important protective actions for these mediators. Clinically, acute infections are principally treated with antibiotics with current approaches devoid of host-directed therapy. In light of the current serious threat of emerging pathogens, in particular those that display antibiotic resistance, the development of therapies to augment host anti-infective mechanisms are needed. Members of the growing new genus of SPMs or their bioactive stable analogues represent potential candidates to harness endogenous anti-inflammatory resolution mechanisms to limit overly exuberant pathogen-mediated inflammation in future therapeutic strategies.",

SPMs have a multipronged action to regulate sentinel innate lymphoid cells to decrease cytokine and increase amphiregulin production.
