In order to increase the surface area for these functions the mucosa of the small intestine is thrown into longitudinal folds (Fig. 2) . This increases the surface area approximately ten times. Further increases in surface area are achieved by development of the main functional unit of the small intestine called the villus (Fig. 3) . These finger-like projections increase the surface area for absorption of nutrients by a further ten times. Each villus is lined by mucosal cells called enterocytes, which are produced by rapidly dividing cells at the base of each villus called the Crypts of Leiberkuhns. As the enterocytes migrate up the villus they mature into functional absorptive cells before being shed into the lumen. On the luminal surface of each enterocyte are hair-like processes called microvilli which carry brush border enzymes for the final stages of digestion and membrane carriers for the absorption of the main nutrients. The continual production of new enterocytes results in the mucosal surface being renewed every three to four days throughout life. The crypt cells have one other function, being responsible for the majority of secretion into the small intestinal lumen.",

This infection is short-lived as crypt cells rapidly replace those enterocytes damaged by the virus. However in the case of parvovirus both mature enterocytes and crypt cells are destroyed resulting in more severe and longer lasting damage which can lead to loss of the mucosal barrier and translocation of pathogens. Bacterial pathogens act by producing toxins which stimulate fluid secretion by the crypt cells.

The colonocytes are primarily responsible for the reabsorption of water and sodium chloride from the faeces prior to their storage in the rectum. The colon can absorb up to 90% of the water presented to it and has a large functional reserve to ensure that even when excessive fluid reaches the colon from the small intestine, 'formed' faeces can still be produced.

Absorption is an energy dependent process that is coupled to the movement of sodium and non-electrolyte solutes across the mucosal barrier. In a healthy animal approximately 50% of the daily fluid intake (including salivary, gastric, pancreatic, hepatic and intestinal secretions) is absorbed in the duodenum and jejunum, 37% in the ileum and 12% in the colon. In the jejunum movement of sodium is coupled to the absorption of glucose and amino acids. In the ileum and colon sodium absorption is not coupled to the movement of other solutes. In the colon sodium absorption occurs across an electrochemical gradient with sodium moving from a high concentration in the lumen to a low concentration inside the epithelial cell. The electrochemical gradient is created by sodiumpotassium ATPase pumps that transport sodium into the cells and eventually the interstitium.

The bacteria also affect digestion and assimilation of fats, carbohydrates, proteins, amino acids and vitamins.

Of most importance is the metabolism of fibre to produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), predominantly acetate, propionate, and butyrate.
