PCR tests i n which a primary \"touchdown\" PCR was followed by secondary reactions using PV or HRV specific primers were able to differentiate HRVs of 48 serotypes from EVs. PVnRT-PCR and HRVnRT-PCR were then used to test nasal and throat swabs from adult subjects with naturally acquired respiratory virus infections. The swabs were also analysed for respiratory viruses by cell culture techniques and the rates of PV identification by the two methods were compared. PVnRT-PCR was found to be at least five times more sensitive than cell culture for the detection of PVs i n these clinical specimens. Paired acute and convalescent serum samples were tested for complement fixing antibodies to adenovirus, influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3, Myco plasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia psittaci. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect rises in antibody level t o coronavirus types 229E and OC43. The overall rate of pathogen identification in 159 swabs from adult asthmatics increased from 28% when only cell culture and serology were used to 57% when these methods were supplemented by PVnRT-PCR. 0 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Each year the average preschool child has 6-10 colds and the average adult 2-4 colds [Sperber and Hayden, 19881 . Research into the effects of colds on normal individuals and on those with chronic lung disease has been hampered by the considerable diEculties encountered in identifying respiratory pathogens. Human rhinoviruses (HRVs), the major causative agents of the common cold [Couch, 19851, are ogy for screening [Hamparian et al., 19871. Rates of virus identification have rarely been greater than 40%. Minor and colleagues (1974) recovered HRVs from 30% of specimens from young asthmatic children with symptomatic respiratory infections, but were only able to isolate HRVs from 12% of specimens from older patients [Minor et al., 19761 . The rates of total virus identification in these studies, using a variety of diagnostic methods, were 49 and 26%.",

Nasal and throat swabs from 27 Leicester University volunteers with high symptom scores were chosen for analysis by PVnRT-PCR. No PVs had been cultured from these specimens although two HRVs and one echovirus had been isolated from other subjects in the study. Seven positive swabs were detected in the 1\"PCR and the products were analyzed by Southern blotting and hybridisation to labelled probes. All seven reacted with the PV probe but only five with the HRV probe. When small amounts of the 1\"PCR products were re-amplified using the PV probe as the reverse primer, five more positive swabs were detected. Thus, 12 out of 27 (44%) nasal and throat swabs which were negative for PV by cell culture were positive when PVnRT-PCR was used. An adenovirus had been isolated from one of the remaining 15 swabs and a further volunteer showed serological evidence of influenza B infection. Thus the use of PVnRT-PCR to detect PVs increased the overall rate of pathogen identification from 7 to 51%. PVnRT-PCR and HRV nRT-PCR were used to analyse 47 nasal and throat swabs from participants in a Cardiff University study (27 from patients with colds and 20 from healthy controls). The swabs were tested in random order and their identity was not known to the investigator until after the experiments were finished. Swabs that gave positive results were extracted, reverse transcribed, and amplified again to confirm the findings. Eleven of the 27 patient swabs (41%) were positive for PV (six being amplified in both 2\"PCRs and thus identified as HRVs) whereas none of the 20 swabs from the healthy controls was positive by either nRT-PCR. Only one of the patient swabs that was positive for PV when tested by PVnRT-PCR was also positive in cell culture. Five of the 16 PV-negative patient swabs had a respiratory pathogen identified by serology. Two were positive for coronavirus, two for influenza A virus and one for adenovirus. The rate of pathogen identification was increased from 22 to 59% by the use of PVnRT-PCR.",

The problem of restricted reactivity with the HRV serotypes from cell cultures was overcome by using the same oligonucleotide as a 2\"PCR primer with a n annealing temperature of 55\u00b0C. All the HRV 1\"PCR products, including those that failed to hybridize with the probe, gave a 2\"PCR product, whereas none of the EVs was amplified. Sommer and Tautz [I9891 found that primers with a length between 17 and 20 nucleotides needed a t least three homologous nucleotides at their 3'-end for successful priming but the remainder of the primer needed surprisingly little homology with the target sequence.",

PVnRT-PCR is also considerably faster since the whole process can be completed in less than two working days. Amplification directly from clinical materials means that cell culture is unnecessary; nRT-PCR is then no more expensive than the traditional method of virus isolation. Although all the cell culture-grown HRVs tested could be differentiated from other PVs using HRVnRT-PCR, it remains possible that this is not true for all HRVs. It is important that both PV and HRV primers are used in 2\"PCRs for HRVs until a sufficiently large number of HRVs from clinical material have been identified by both this method and by cell culture.",
