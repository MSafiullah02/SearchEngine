The pandemic originated from a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a virus similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The dynamics of the pathogen incurred the incidence of the unidentified cases that were potentially substantial in magnitude. Unparalleled extensive measures, either in terms of medical quarantine or non-medical containment, were taken to deplete the growth of infected population and thereafter settle down the outbreak. We aimed to estimate the gap in sizes and peak dates between the confirmed and unconfirmed, and how containment measures impacted the dynamic trajectory of the COVID-19 in Japan. We performed simulations and desired to provide meaningful insight for the upcoming responses to the outbreak, for which much still remained to be unknown.",

By applying the transmission model to the latest outbreak data in Japan, we established the least-squares fitted estimates parameters and the epidemiological trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic. In compliance with the estimated framework, we simulated the ongoing trend of outbreak in Japan by calibrating the potential changes in measures ceteris paribus starting April 7, the date when the state of emergency was declared.

Medical and non-medical measures were effective in controlling the outbreak of COVID-19.

China adopted multiple options of efforts including medical quarantine and non-medical measures, such as isolation of cases, physical distancing, contact tracing, school closure and workplace shutdown, at a national level to break down the spread of COVID-19. By significantly decreasing the likelihood of close proximity person-to-person contact, these measures took effect and by the end of March 2020 the reported cases lowered dramatically. Japan identified its first case of COVID-19 on Jan 22, 2020 and dynamic exponential-like growth of cases was observed since. The investigation of epidemiological feature for containment measures in other countries attracted much attention; in contrast, the trajectory for Japan remained to be unclear. We searched web of science and science direct for research published in English from 2019 up to May 6, 2020, with the terms\"coronavirus control or containment measures\" in combination with \"Japan\"and identified 6 and 5 results respectively. Relatively little was known about the gap in size and in peak time between the confirmed and unconfirmed in Japan; how containment measures influenced its trajectory of COVID-19 since the state of emergency was declared; and how the shift of the pandemic was influenced by the containment.",

Medical quarantine typically corresponded to cases with severe symptoms that need urgent care; in comparison, non-medical measures consisted of a wider variety of control by complementing the effect of quarantine and corresponded to cases such as asymptomatic, presymptomatic, mild symptomatic patients and the susceptibles. We found that the declaration of state of emergency incurred social behaviors change and was in connection with subsequent sub-exponential growth of cases. Our study implied the essential existence of gap, subsequently quantified its asymptotic size and its peak timing between the identified and the unidentified. Time-delaying effect in saturation was meaningful in that it provided the information to understand the intrinsic intra-correlation of an epidemic like COVID-19. The outcomes of simulation implied that early containment measures which linked to a reduced and predated peak, were crucial to control further spread.

Countries such as France found that it was already spreading in December 2019, a month before the official first cases in the country. It was projected that COVID-19 epidemic might have started much earlier than assumed. 1 As of May 1, 2020, confirmed infections reached 3,145,407, including 221,823 deaths (i.e., average mortality rate of nearly 7\u00b7 05%) based on the report by WHO. 2 The accurate number of unconfirmed cases were to be ascertained. This has potentially changed the past concept of local and sporadic outbreaks of epidemics to an extensive and compounding cycle of response and recovery. 3 A variety of unrivalled medical quarantine and non-medical containment measures has been employed in response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. 4 While comprehensive adverse effects on the infected and biological attributes of the pathogen were to be uncovered, countries and communities with early isolating of cases, curtailing person-to-person contacts, physical distancing, tracing close contact in combination with hygiene practices (e.g., utilization of masks or disinfectant) have obtained meaningful control and the practice may be of interest to other communities where divergent growth of the infections was still under way and where later growth tended to drastically shift from earlier baseline at a pace out of expectation. 4, 5 The dynamics of human-to-human transmission risk correlated with the external interventions coupled with interactions of individuals and other time-contingent factors that might impact the trajectory. 6 In the unpredicted occurrence where information on the transmission fluctuation and routes was incomplete, prompt containment, timely screening and isolation evolved to be crucial in control of the spread risk of the pandemic. Medical (i.e., pharmaceutical) quarantine was used in numerous affected countries, and non-medical (i.e., non-pharmaceutical) measures such as physical distancing and contact tracing effectively influenced the trajectory of progression in shrinking the outbreak of COVID-19. Local residents were typically called upon to stay home when able and to perform physical distancing and hygiene practice when not. Control measures aimed at reducing the contact in the population delayed the peak and reduced the ultimate size of the epidemic. 7, 8 Discrete spreading events in connection to a later explosion of spread had been identified for past SARS outbreak and were not exceptional for COVID-19 epidemic as well, unmanageable and random mass movement deteriorated the spread. Hence, early shutdown of the transmission routes of these discrete events was of importance All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

Hence, stringent implementation of measures was critical in effective interruption of the chains of transmission. 12 Outbreaks of SARS characterized marked differences between the affected regions in total infections and epidemic duration, even for those where outbreaks started and identical control measures were enacted simultaneously. 13 Knowledge was still insufficient about COVID-19. Preventing further spread and controlling subsequent occurrence of pandemic remained to be a global priority. 14 And the existence of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections complicated the trajectory of epidemic. 15 Human-to-human transmission was confirmed in other places of Japan since its first identified case. 16 Countries could migrate to be worldwide epicenters of outbreak unless substantial health interventions at a variety of levels were implemented instantly. Large scale of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission in the absence of public health interventions would induce international seeding and subsequent local establishment of epidemics inevitable. 17, 18 To quantify the gap between the confirmed and unconfirmed cases in terms of sizes and peak dates and anticipate how the trend of COVID-2019 spread was influenced by the containment, we first performed least-squares fitted parameters analysis based on outbreak surveillance data in Japan and then forwarded to the simulations of the spread trajectories contingent on the fitting outcome by assuming containment changes triggered since the emergency declaration.",

A cut of at least 70 percent in human-to-human contact was expected. By May 4, it was further extended until the end of that month. The declaration enabled prefectures to employ stronger preventive measures, ranging from instructing citizens to stay home, avoid \"3Cs\" (i.e., closed spaces where crowds gathered in close proximity), restricting the operation of schools and other facilities. It hinged greatly on self-compliance of individuals and no legal penalties for noncompliance up to that point. Government issued a series of economic assistance by then, including a uniform subsidy of 10 thousand JPY to each individual and support programs for firms in response to the epidemic. 19 All rights reserved.

To check, we explored how the differentiation in duration of infection affected the trajectory of outbreak by increasing its values from 8 to 18 days with a step of 2-day increment. The least-squares estimate for was close to the boundary, which implied that the medical quarantine was not at work in its equilibrium and a low capacity of healthcare was to be assumed. The typical scenarios in which containment is to be employed in response to an epidemic can be summarized in their simplest (Figure 1) . This applies to a setting in which the capacity or quality of healthcare is not at full performance or the capacity is of relative tininess. In the case in which equilibrium of healthcare is not to be presumed, treatment of infections is to be differentiated depending on infectiousness, symptoms and the accommodation capacity of the healthcare system. Privilege is given to severely symptomatic cases and thus immediate medical quarantine is needed. In contrast, asymptomatic or mild-symptom patients are typically recommended to comply with the strategy of non-medical containment by staying home or at locally assigned places. The dynamics of COVID-19 updates this by either deteriorating to severe infections or recovering from it. Severe symptomatic patients might recover or die from the intense medical quarantine by chance. For the general population, non-medical containment is enacted such as the necessity of hygiene practice or physical distancing. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

In the subsequent scenarios, we then inherited all the fitted parameters but the rate of control with the utilization of an increment of one-day step. We calibrated the changes with respective to each containment starting the state of emergence to forecast the preliminary evolution trajectory of the outbreak beyond that point ( figure 3; figure 4 ). The estimates implied that the peaks of the unconfirmed and the confirmed did not coincide. The dates of peak for the former occurred around May 6 whereas it was delayed almost two-and-half months for the latter, which reached its peak around late July. In contrast, the ultimate saturation in magnitude for both was at a commensurate level, indicating approximately 34 thousand cases. At a time in between the two spikes, identified cases were to continue growing but unidentified cases started to decrease. Prior to the saturation of the unidentified, the size of gap was increasing over time but the opposite was to be observed after its summit was past and thereafter the pandemic faded gradually out or became the next starting point of recurrent outbreaks, as would be corrected by the dynamics of COVID-19. The estimate indicated that at a certain point after the state of emergence, the confirmed infections shifted to a sub-exponential or algebraic growth. Hence, it was projected that the state of emergence took effect and slowed down the initially exponential-like trajectory of outbreak (figure 2).

Hence, the longer days of DOI, the longer of time to get to the peak of outbreak and the larger of peak size. This applied to trajectories of the confirmed and the unconfirmed identically.

In contrast, the peak size of both was at a comparative level. Both estimates hinged on the duration of infection.

In a setting where the capacity of healthcare was presumed with relative stability, non-medical containment such as staying home or at local places, physical distancing and tracing close contact was to implement with priority. Our simulations implied that it could potentially incur a comparative level of effect when effectively followed. We projected that under an interval [8d,18d] for duration of infection, the peak size of COVID-19 outbreak in Japan would be of a range 24 to 38 thousand of unidentified infections, the peak dates of which would potentially fluctuate between late April and mid of May. Although a commensurate level of peak size could be expected for the confirmed cases, the time of saturation presented a delaying effect and converged until late May to late July hinging on the strength of the infectiousness.

One critical factor was how asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic and mild-symptomatic individuals responded to COVID-19 in regard to the feasibility of prevention of a second-time outbreak. Other factors that might impact the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic were not accounted for in our model as well. In the case where presumed assumptions were relaxed, the likelihood in connection with differentiated scenarios would increase. The simulation based on the fitted parameters indicated that the unidentified cases were generally larger than the reported cases. We investigated a range of scenarios where the heterogeneity of containment changed the trajectory of the transmission. As uncertainty existed in the factors such as the interval of infectiousness for asymptomatic, non-medical containment would be of importance to enhance the effect of control in combination with medical quarantine. The model could be modified to incorporate other unaccounted factors impacting the dynamics of the transmission, which would implicitly alter the trend of the COVID-19 outbreak. To avoid and control spread in randomness, the first couple of months might be of great importance. 7, 8 As clinical knowledge of this novel pathogen and its dynamics accrues, it is feasible that outcomes will improve. It therefore will be of concern to revise these estimates as epidemics unfold. 26 And because of the asymptotic approach utilized, qualitative evidence was to be established. The inherent relationship between the confirmed and unknown cases was asymptotically identified and hence its precision was up to the point where the inherent approach applied. The analysis could not differentiate the efficacy of specific containment, nor could it differentiate the effect for the asymptomatic, presymptomatic, symptomatic and infection-route-unknown compartment respectively. However, it reinforced other findings by showing that medical and non-medical control, when timely and successfully implemented, were feasible in decelerating or even diminishing the spread of the pandemic: with an earlier arrival of peak dates and reduced peak sizes. This could be informative when it was too lengthy for the outbreak to converge and when it was to accurately interpret the outbreak as \"plus \" resulting from the dynamics. The meaning of this study partially lied in that we asymptotically identified the quantitative size of this. Containment measures were preferred to be performed at an earlier stage and the effectiveness has been identified in other countries and past outbreaks. Changes of behaviors were observed in response to the epidemic where asymptomatic, mild-and pre-symptomatic infections were not to be ascertained. The might be of great importance for developing control measures for presently widely spread secondary or future recurrent outbreaks of COVID-19.",

In contrast, the effectiveness of pathogen testing has been confirmed in other countries. 28 The dynamics of COVID-19 caused the intrinsic existence of individuals with undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is of priority to act according to WHO's recommendations of a combination of measures: rapid and adequate diagnosis, immediate isolation of confirmed cases, rigorous tracking and precautionary self-isolation of close contact. Medical quarantine and non-medical control have been implemented by other countries to prevent further spread and helped reduce the imported or exported cases. 18 While it is critical to balance the control of spread and economic impact from COVID-19, when this is not feasible then priority is to be taken. 29, 30 The transmission of COVID-19 was supposed to be more infectious than past SARS outbreak. 31 Infectiousness was estimated to peak on or before symptom onset, and thus many infections potentially took place in an unnoticeable way. Disease control measures should be adjusted to account for probable substantial subclinical transmission. 32 COVID-19 had more severe pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infections than influenza A and SARS and clinical studies were to evaluate the viremia and the dynamics in individuals. Heterogeneities might exist in the between-communities measures as well as in the responses to containment, growth in sporadic events could overwhelm the contact tracing system, leading to the necessity for broader-scale social interventions. Ongoing data collection, epidemiological analysis and alongside clinical research on COVID-19 are therefore essential parts of assessing the impacts of measures. 29 Prolonged or intermittent non-medical measure such as social distancing may be of necessity years ahead. 31 This might potentially redefine the daily routine that we are experiencing by this time. 23 It was shown that the crude size of epidemic could be roughly estimated based on its initial dynamics under certain public health interventions. The possible trajectories of an outbreak hinged on the levels of public health interventions such as quarantine and precautionary measures. 33 The uncertainty of the timing and duration of peak was contributable to multiple factors, including stochasticity in early dynamics, heterogeneities in contact patterns, spatial variation and dynamics of the epidemiological parameters. 29 SARS was eventually contained by means of prompt isolation, strict quarantine of contacts, and top-down enforcement of community containment and COVID-19 outbreak of the first wave has been controlled in some countries to date. Striking similarities between SARS and COVID-19 were identified, but more difference was to be ascertained. Even if traditional public health measures are incapable to completely contain the outbreak of COVID-19, they will still be operative in reducing the peak incidence and mortality when no vaccine is available. 34 While rigorous control policies were to associate with a slower growth in cases, in the extremity where stay-at-home restrictions are unlikely to be the one-shot deal, a gradual approach to restrictive measures might be of necessity. 23 It will be particularly meaningful to design measures for long-term medical and non-medical control of COVID-19, along with large scale testing and contact tracing and isolation. Research should concentrate on refining specific estimates of susceptibility to infections, which is instrumental to appraise the impact of these strategies. 28 In the absence of effective measures, pandemic spread widely and thus considerable effort at a variety of levels was of necessity for the outbreak to settle down. Such efforts will be essential to quench local outbreaks and reduce the risk of further global dissemination. 35, 36 Protective measures would compromise the effectiveness as cases accrue or the later dynamics altered significantly, in which optimization of the All rights reserved.

Interventions based on medical quarantine and non-medical containment present a strong potential to reduce the magnitude of peak sizes and cause an earlier arrival of peak dates of COVID-19 outbreak in Japan. Lowering and flattening of the pandemic peak is particularly of concern, as this reduces the acute pressure on the healthcare system as well as on the society. When it is of difficulty to pinpoint the next epidemic, the measures taken as of today would matter. 16, 39 Contributors NI, ZWQ, WS, and GY conceived the study. NI designed, coded the model, and made the figures. ZWQ, WS, and GY consulted on the analyses.
