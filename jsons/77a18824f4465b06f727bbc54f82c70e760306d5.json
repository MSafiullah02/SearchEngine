Suicides 5 , child mortality 6 and deaths from 'treatable' cancers such as breast and prostate 7 have all been demonstrated to rise with unemployment. The putative mechanisms behind these associations range from increased mental health issues arising from unemployment to inadequate access to the care often enabled by employment packages, especially in countries that lack universal health coverage. Features of this recession may well exacerbate these issues: enforced home isolation and shuttering of whole sectors of the economy could contribute to a net rise in mortality that could run into the thousands or more globally.",

Putting aside the economic arguments, it has become increasingly apparent that austerity accompanied by a reduction in real-term public health & social care spending is associated with a relative rise in all-cause mortality 8, 9 . The magnitude of the effect is substantial and could lead to hundreds of thousands or more 'excess' deaths globally over a period of several years. Therefore, the number of lives lost due to COVID-19 has the potential to be eclipsed by the number of lives lost as a result of maladaptive responses to the pandemic. Governments have already enacted measures such as lockdowns and social distancing with some positive results starting to emerge. Now is the time to consider how to maintain public health & social care spending levels, while ensuring robust access to services by the unemployed, to ensure the health of the population is preserved long after the COVID-19 pandemic has passed.",
