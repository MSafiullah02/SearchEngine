Consequently, tools that enable the fast, accurate and sensitive diagnosis of these infections becomes crucial for the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in every country. During the acute phase of these types of infections, rapid diagnosis is essential in order to provide immediate and necessary clinical treatment and infection control. More importantly, it may limit the spread of further infection.",

            "text": "Dengue fever is one of these acutely infectious diseases. Traditionally, a hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay is commonly used for the diagnosis of dengue virus (DV) infection (Groen et al., 2000). It is an easy protocol with reasonable accuracy. Recently, a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, a molecular diagnostic method for the detection of dengue fever, provides a highly sensitive and accurate diagnosis protocol (Shu et al., 2003a). However, it requires a complicated protocol and is relatively costly. Alternatively, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is another well-recognized serological diagnostic method for the detection of a DV infection (Shu et al., 2003b, Andrew et al., 2006). It provides for a rapid diagnosis at a relatively low cost. The principle behind this serological diagnosis is based on the detection of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM), which are specific to pathogens. The presence of IgM indicates an acute infection whereas IgG is a marker for a previous infection. Therefore, the simultaneous detection of IgM and IgG would provide a more accurate diagnosis. The measurements of IgG or IgM associated with a DV infection have been reported in the literature (Hapugoda et al., 2007, Chanama et al., 2004). However, a conventional ELISA is usually performed on 96-well plates, which involves a series of tedious processes, including incubation and washing steps. Not only is it a time-consuming (over 4 h) and labor-intensive process, but it also requires well-trained personnel to precisely perform the entire protocol. In addition, it cannot be used to detect IgM and IgG simultaneously. More importantly, the microorganism-induced antibody response of the host can be early diagnosed during the infection by a more sensitive immunological detection technique. The detection limit of the developed method is the detectable signals of immunoglobulins in the clinical bio-samples that can be more specifically and accurately analyzed. The sensitivity of the conventional ELISA is not adequate because the antigen is coated onto a two-dimensional 96-well plate, which limits binding capacity of antibody. Using the virus-holding magnetic complexes can increase the binding capacity of the specific antibody with their 3D structures, and therefore increase the detection sensitivity. Therefore, there exists a critical need to develop a platform for the rapid, automatic, and simultaneous detection of IgM and IgG associated with a DV infection with a higher sensitivity.",

            "text": "Advances in micromachining and microfluidic technologies have enabled the miniaturization of many chemical and biomedical instruments. A micro-total-analysis-system (\u03bc-TAS) can be realized using Micro-electromechanical-systems (MEMS) technology, which integrates several functional modules on a single chip for sample preparation, reaction, transportation and detection (Auroux et al., 2002, Bini et al., 2008). Microfluidic techniques have shown its great potential for automatic processing (Lien et al., 2008). Recently, several magnetic bead-based microfluidic systems have been demonstrated for biomedical applications (Huang et al., 2002, Gijs, 2004, Choi et al., 2000). For example, a magnetic bead-based immunoassay utilizing immobilization surfaces and bio-molecule carriers for protein analysis has been reported (Choi et al., 2000). Recently, magnetic beads coated with antibodies specific to target pathogens have been commonly used to purify and to enrich bio-samples (Fuentes et al., 2006, Lien et al., 2007). These microfluidic systems usually provide advantages over their large-scale counterparts including a shorter diagnosis time, less sample/reagent consumption, a lower operating cost and even higher sensitivity (Auroux et al., 2002, Reyes et al., 2002). More importantly, a variety of integrated devices for sample preparation, reaction and detection have been successfully demonstrated, the entire diagnostic process can be performed automatically using integrated micropumps and microvalves on the same chip (Lien et al., 2008). Consequently, various bead-based immunoassays implemented via microfluidic systems have been reported. Generally speaking, bead-based immunoassays have several advantages when compared with substrate-based assays (Vignali, 2000). In addition to their capability for sample purification, the micro-beads have a three-dimensional structure which increases the surface-to-volume ratio, thus providing more binding sites for target bio-samples. Furthermore, surface modification of a microfluidic device was also reported to enhance the sensitivity and selectivity of an immunoassay (Bai et al., 2006). For example, it has been demonstrated that rabbit IgG and human IgG can be detected with the incorporation of these nano-particles into microfluidic systems (Matsunaga et al., 2007, Holmes et al., 2007). However, there are still several lengthy off-chip sample pre-treatment processes necessary to purify the samples prior to usage and numerous bulky apparatus are normally required for the entire procedure.",

To utilize the affinity between the antibodies and the antigens (Haukanes and Kvam, 1993), the immunoglobulins in the sample serum are captured by the virus-bound magnetic beads with a high selectivity. Fig. 1(a) is an illustration of a sandwich-based immunoassay with magnetic beads. Using the DV\u2013bead complex ensures that any captured IgM and IgG is specific to the DV. Therefore, this enhances the selectivity of the virus detection. The virus is treated with ultraviolet (UV) rays prior to use to inactivate its infectivity, but not its structure. Consequently, infection and contamination issues are eliminated. The surface of the superparamagnetic beads is coated with an epoxy and is conjugated with the capture antibodies. The DV is bound to the antibody-conjugated beads by the affinity between the antibody and the antigen. The DV\u2013bead complex can then detect the target IgM and IgG in serum samples during the incubation process. Finally, the target IgM and IgG are recognized by the specific attached antibodies (anti-human IgG antibody labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and anti-human IgM antibody labelled with R-phycoerythrin (R-PE)). Fig. 1(b) illustrates the protocol for the magnetic bead-based microfluidic system. First, the DV-antibody-conjugated magnetic beads (5 \u03bcl) and the serum samples (100 \u03bcl) are loaded in a \u201cmixing chamber.\u201d A four-membrane-type micromixer is used to incubate these virus-bound magnetic beads and the serum samples for 5 min, so that the virus-specific IgM and IgG in the serum samples can be recognized and can be attached onto the virus-bound magnetic beads (Fig. 1(b-1)). This is followed by purifying and isolating these beads utilizing a magnetic field generated from the on-chip microcoils. Any interfering material in the biological fluids would be washed away into a waste chamber by flowing a wash buffer (1\u00d7 phosphate buffer saline (PBS) with 0.5% Tween 20) (Fig. 1(b-2)). After washing, the purified beads with IgM and IgG are re-suspended into a smaller volume, and the purified beads are then transported into the mixing chamber using a two-way micropump. This is followed by adding the developed antibody fluorescent conjugates (anti-human IgM-R-PE and anti-human IgG-FITC) into the mixing chamber (Fig. 1(b-3)). After incubating for 2 min, anti-human IgM-R-PE antibodies and anti-human IgG-FITC should be individually bound onto the surface of the IgM and IgG that are attached to the magnetic bead complex. Then, a washing step is repeated to flush out other impurities and any un-bound developed antibodies (Fig. 1(b-4)). Finally, the sandwich-like magnetic bead complexes are transported to a \u201cdetection chamber\u201d where the fluorescent signal is excited and is analyzed by an optical detection module consisting of a photo-multiplier tube (PMT) and a mercury lamp (Fig. 1(b-5)). Detailed information about the experimental procedure including the reaction volume of the samples and the on-chip operation conditions of the miniature platform can be found in Table 1\n.",

A photograph of this magnetic bead-based microfluidic system is shown in Fig. 2(a). The dimensions of the chip are measured to be 53 mm \u00d7 37 mm. The microfluidic chip integrates several modules into a single chip, including a sample chamber, a four-membrane-type micromixer, microchannels, two-way micropumps, a circular array of microcoils, a sample loading/mixing chamber, a sample purification chamber, two sample detection chambers and a waste collection chamber. The details about design parameters of the microfluidic system can be found in the supplemental Fig. 2. This chip is composed of three polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Sylgad 184A/B, Dow Corning Corp., USA) layers and one glass layer. In order to perform the simultaneous detection of IgG and IgM, microcoils are first used in a bio-separator and micropumps and microvalves are used for sample transportation. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the components and the SU-8 molds can be found in the supplemental Fig. 1(a). Details of the fabrication process for the circular microcoil array, micropumps and microvalves can be found in our previous work (Lien et al., 2007, Lien et al., 2008). The circular array of microcoils is used as a bio-separator when the washing buffer flows through the sample purification chamber. The array is supplied with a direct current (DC) to generate the required magnetic field so that the magnetic beads with IgM and IgG are attracted onto the surface of the microcoils. In this study, a two-way micropump is used to transport fluids forward and backwards. There are two inlets for the compressed air in the two-way micropump which is regulated by electromagnetic valves (EMV, SMC Inc., S070 M-5BG-32, Japan). The liquid in the microchannels can be delivered forward or backwards by the sequential activation of the peristaltic micropumps which are driven by the air pressure. Besides, the two-way micropump can be also used as a microvalve, if the PDMS membranes are deformed completely to block the fluid in the microchannel.",

Air tubing is connected to the \u201ccompressed air inlet\u201d to convey the compressed air to the air chamber of the four-membrane-type micromixer. When the compressed air passes through the connecting air channels, the air cavities under the four thin-film PDMS membranes are filled up in sequence and a time-phased deflection of the membranes is then generated.

The four-membrane-type micromixer is designed for gentle handling of DV-magnetic bead complexes and serum samples. A mixing efficiency index is used to quantify the mixing performance (Tseng et al., 2007). The mixing efficiency is evaluated by measuring the concentration distribution along a cross section of the mixing chamber. 1 \u03bcl of blue ink and 100 \u03bcl of deionized (DI) water are loaded into the mixing chamber to measure the efficiency of the four-membrane-type micromixer. The four-membrane-type micromixer is actuated at 1.37 Hz with an applied pressure of 20 psi. The experimental data reveal that the mixing of the DI water and the blue ink can be completed within 6 s. A normalized concentration profile across the mixing chamber is shown in Fig. 3(a), where X+ is the normalized location across the mixing chamber and C+ is the normalized concentration. Experimental data show that the mixing efficiency of the micromixer can be as high as 96% after mixing for 6 s. In order to achieve a time-phased deflection of the four membranes, a low frequency (1.37 Hz) is used to operate the four-membrane-type micromixer to generate a gradual mixing effect. The serpentine-shape air channels connecting the air chambers are used to achieve the time-phase expansion of the PDMS membranes. A high-speed, charge-coupled device (CCD, MC1311, Mikrotron, Germany) is used to verify the time-delayed expansion of each PDMS membrane. A time interval of 0.015 s is calculated between each neighboring PDMS membrane. Note that gentle mixing avoids mechanical separation of the bonding between antibodies and antigens.",

The mixing between the antibody-conjugated magnetic beads and the DV is the most critical process for IgM and IgG detection. Incubating 2 \u03bcl of anti-E antibody with magnetic beads (4 \u00d7 108\n beads/ml) and 100 \u03bcl of DV serotype 2 (108\n PFU/ml) reveals that it only takes 20 min to reach a saturated fluorescent intensity (59.2 \u00b1 5 arbitrary unit (a.u.), n\n = 4) by utilizing the four-membrane-type micromixer under optimal operating conditions (an applied air pressure of 20 psi and at a driving frequency of 1.37 Hz). However, the large-scale shaker requires more than 40 min to achieve a fluorescent intensity of 46.5 a.u. Note that the sample volume of large-scale shaker and microfluidic system are the same. Since the ratio between the reaction volume of the sample and volume of the eppendorf is greater than the ratio between the reaction volume of the sample and the volume of the micromixer, the mixing efficiency for this micromixer is superior to the large-scale shaker. Therefore, each incubation process of the microfluidic system is shorter (20 min) than the large-scale shaker (40 min). Moreover, there are another two major steps in the incubation process, including the mixing of the virus-bound magnetic beads with serum samples and the mixing of the immunoglobulin-bound magnetic bead complexes with the developed antibody. The four-membrane-type micromixer provides well-mixed incubation when inflating and releasing the membranes with an air pressure of 20 psi at an operating frequency of 1.37 Hz. Under this optimal operating condition, the two other major incubation steps in the prototype microfluidic system only take 5 min and 2 min, respectively. Whereas on the second stage of detecting the human IgM or IgG to dengue virus, the anti-dengue IgM/IgG antibodies are polyclonal in nature, which can bind the dengue virus with multiple epitopes. The developing anti-human IgM or IgG R-PE or FITC conjugated antibodies are also polyclonal in nature with multiple epitope binding. The multiple binding valances with high avidity can shorten the mixing time to 5 and 2 min, respectively. Therefore, the developed magnetic bead-based microfluidic system can perform this entire protocol within 30 min. Note that the traditional method using a large-scale shaker would take more than 40 min for each incubation process. The total reaction time is only 12.5% of the time required for a traditional method using ELISA (more than 4 h).",

From the experimental results, the detectable fluorescent intensity is measured to be 15.8 \u00b1 2 a.u. (n\n = 3) in sample #7 (2.19 \u00d7 10\u22122\n ng). Note that the fluorescent intensity of the negative control is 8.92 a.u. The S/N ratio for sample #7 is measured to be 4.02. The detection limit of this integrated microfluidic system is then found to be 21 pg based on sample #7 (Fig. 5). Therefore, the \u201cpositive\u201d and \u201cnegative\u201d cases in the current study can only be presented as the detectable sensitivity of the developed system due to the lack of the statistical analyses. In other words, the individual carried with the IgG/IgM with the amount higher than 21 pg, which can be detected in the proposed system, would be classified as the \u201cpositive\u201d case. Consequently, compared to a conventional ELISA, where the same pair of capture and developed monoclonal antibodies is used to detect the DV, the sensitivity is found to be 0.8 ng. Therefore, the detection limit of this integrated microfluidic system is 38 times (0.8 ng/21 pg) better. The sensitivity is significantly increased due to the fact that the magnetic beads hold the virus particle and expose the three-dimension structure of the bound viral particles, thus increasing the surface capacity of the nano-beads to hold more antibody\u2013virus complexes. The small amount of fluids in the microfluidic system, combined with gentle mixing assures a well-mixed reaction and enhances the interaction between the antibodies and the antigen, thus resulting in a superior affinity between antibodies and antigens, as compared to that in the large-scale system. Furthermore, the detection limit of this developed system is considerably improved by using the FIA when compared with other micro systems. For example, a polymer lab-on-a-chip for a magnetic bead-based immunoassay to detect mouse IgG was reported to have a detection limit of 16.4 ng/ml (Do and Ahn, 2008). In addition, a microfluidic immunoassay capable of detection of rabbit IgG and mouse IgG was reported (Kim and Park, 2005). The sensitivity was measured to be 244 pg and 15.6 ng, respectively. Consequently, the proposed microfluidic system integrated with FIA and a sample pre-treatment module can be used as a potential platform for more sensitive biomedical diagnosis.",

A microfluidic control module, a bead purification module and an optical detection module are integrated into a single chip to carry out bio-sample incubation, purification and optical analysis automatically. Experimental results indicated that the microfluidic system could reduce the total detection time to 30 min. In addition, the results also showed that IgG with a concentration as low as 21 pg can be detected successfully by this system. Therefore, this integrated system may provide a powerful platform for rapid diagnosis of DV infection. Furthermore, modification of the protocol can be also used for the rapid, automatic diagnosis of other acute infectious diseases.",
