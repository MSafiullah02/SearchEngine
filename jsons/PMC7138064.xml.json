Yet, a crisis of confidence in the Regulations exists, with the Review Committee on International Health Regulations functioning during Ebola currently deliberating.15 We propose a series of operational and legal reforms. Operational reforms are often preferable. Amendments to the text of the International Health Regulations require World Health Assembly approval, do not enter into force immediately, and must be operationalised to be successful. Furthermore, reopening the full text could entail a multiyear negotiating process, which risks weakening the International Health Regulations' norms and protection of human rights. Even for our proposed legal reforms, we suggest ways to achieve them by textual interpretation and annex amendments in an attempt to avoid renegotiating the main text of the International Health Regulations.",

For example, WHO uses the Emergency Response Framework to inform the international community of an outbreak's severity in a graduated manner.24 WHO's use of two distinct frameworks (the Emergency Response Framework and the International Health Regulations) resulted in confusion during the Ebola outbreak.
