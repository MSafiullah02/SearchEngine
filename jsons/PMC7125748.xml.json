The recent outbreaks of human epidemics such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and H1N1 influenza have caused the death of many people  [1], [2]. Analogously, the propagation of malware on computer networks and cell-phone networks can cause system damage, information leakage, and even economic loss  [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. So, controlling epidemic spreading effectively has become an important issue today. To this end, it is necessary for us to gain a deep understanding of epidemic dynamics in the real-world environments.",

            "text": "In the last decade, epidemic spreading in complex networks has been extensively explored by researchers from a number of different disciplines such as theoretical biology, statistical physics, mathematics, and computer science  [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. In most studies, the substrate network is represented as a static network where each node stands for a single individual and edges between individuals are fixed. The remarkable result is that the epidemic threshold is a positive value in homogeneous networks such as regular lattices and random networks, but tends to zero in a wide range of scale-free (SF) networks  [9]. On the other hand, some other studies investigated epidemic spreading in the dynamical network model with the assumption that all mobile agents have the same action radius and move randomly on a plane satisfying periodic boundary conditions[19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. The mobility of individuals has been proved to have a significant impact on the epidemic behavior. For example, Buscarino et al. studied disease spreading in a system of random walkers which additionally perform long-distance jumps, and found that a small percentage of jumps in the agent motion are sufficient to produce a large drop in the epidemic threshold  [21].",

In these models, the social network is characterized by the metapopulation network where each node represents a city (subpopulation) consisting of any number of individuals and links denote transportation routes among cities. The individuals\u2019 reaction (infection) process occurs within nodes and the diffusion (mobility) process happens among nodes. In the diffusion process, some infected individuals as carriers of a disease may infect previously unaffected nodes. The network topology and diffusion pattern are two key factors in understanding such an epidemic spreading  [25], [26], [29]. More recently, people have begun to pay much attention to how the nodes\u2019 local properties, such as heterogeneous length of stay of hosts\u2019 movements  [31], city-size heterogeneity  [32], local population structure  [33] and local epidemic curing rate  [34], affect the metapopulation epidemic dynamics.",

In reality, at different subpopulations, human disease infectivity may possess discrepancies because of social, geographical or cultural aspects. It has been shown that the location-specific factor induces the substantial variation of disease incidence between populations  [35], [36], and the impact of the epidemic in European countries is highly different because of the marked differences in the sociodemographic structure of European populations  [37]. In the present work, we introduce a heterogeneous infection rate to characterize the effect of the distinctive nodes\u2019 local properties, such as population density, individual health habit, and social conditions, on epidemic infectivity, and study its impact on the metapopulation epidemic dynamics. By using a mean-field (MF) approach and Monte Carlo simulations, it is shown that the heterogeneity of the infection rate has a significant impact on the epidemic threshold as well as the temporal behavior of the prevalence above the epidemic threshold. Note that some related works studied epidemic dynamics on Erd\u00f6s\u2013R\u00e9nyi (ER) networks with other heterogeneous infection rates across links that are proportional to the intensity of interactions between people  [38], [39].",

The RD process on this network is described as follows. First, reaction (infection) occurring within each node i follows the dynamics of the classical susceptible\u2013infected\u2013susceptible (SIS) model with two parameters \u03b2i (a local infection rate related to the properties of node i) and \u03bc (a global constant recovery rate). The reaction process can be schematically represented by (1)I+S\u2192\u03b2i2I,I\u2192\u03bcS. The first sub-equation means that each susceptible (S) individual becomes infected with probability \u03b2i if it meets an infected (I) individual, and the second sub-equation indicates that the infected individuals are cured and become susceptible again with probability \u03bc. Within node i, let Si(t) and Ii(t) denote the number of infected and susceptible individuals at time step t, respectively. Thus the number of new infected individuals within node i at time step t can be represented as \u03b2iSi(t)Ii(t) when each susceptible individual may react with all the infected individuals in the same node  [25].",

(2): negative-correlation infection regime (NIR) (i.e., the case of \u03b1<0) and positive-correlation infection regime (PIR) (i.e., the case of \u03b1>0). For NIR, the infection rate is negatively related to the node degree. That is to say, the infection rate in nodes with higher degree is smaller than that in nodes with lower degree. This may be understood as follows. Individuals in well-connected central cities (i.e., nodes with higher degree) generally have better health habits, such as washing hands and wearing masks, and have more opportunities for vaccinations than those in peripheral locations (i.e., nodes with lower degree) when an epidemic breaks out. Conversely, for PIR, the infection rate is positively related to the node degree. That is, central cities have a larger infection rate compared with peripheral locations. This can be explained by the fact that central cities generally have a higher population density leading to closer distance and stronger interaction among individuals  [41]. This in some sense means that a susceptible individual can be infected with higher probability when it contacts with an infected individual. In the special case of \u03b1=0, we have a homogeneous infection rate \u03b2k=\u03b2 that has been considered in the previous studies  [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33].",

On the other hand, as a result of the stochastic migration process, most individuals will gather in nodes with higher degree, and this is convenient for epidemic invasion in those nodes. In such cases, epidemic speed in the PIR infection regime is larger than that in the NIR infection regime at early time steps due to the fact that infection mainly occurs in nodes with higher degree. As time goes on, the epidemic diffuses to nodes with lower degree. From this time, epidemic speed in the NIR infection regime begins to increase because of larger infection rates in those nodes with lower degree.",

By a MF approach and Monte Carlo simulations, the impact of these two infection regimes on epidemic dynamics has been studied in heterogeneous metapopulation networks with individuals diffusing randomly. Interesting results have been found as follows. In the case that the susceptible individuals cannot move and the infected individuals always move (i.e., Case 1 mobility pattern), NIR and PIR infection regimes produce the same impact on the epidemic threshold, i.e., increasing the epidemic threshold by the same extent. However, when both the susceptible and infected individuals always move (i.e., Case 2 mobility pattern), the PIR infection regime decreases the threshold and NIR increases it. Furthermore, we have also provided some simulations of the temporal behavior of the prevalence above the epidemic threshold in the Case 1 mobility pattern. It is shown that, compared with the NIR infection regime, the PIR infection regime favors the epidemic invasion at early time steps, but in the long-time limit, these two infection regimes have the same impact on the final epidemic prevalence.",

For the general case, we have only given the simulation results. In spite of this, our study has uncovered an important aspect (i.e., the impact of local properties of the node on epidemic infectivity) that must be considered in modeling and understanding epidemic dynamics in social networks. Certainly, the full theoretical solution of the present model may be obtained by the integration method used in Ref.  [50], which will be our future work.",
