In total, more than two million COVID-19 cases have been reported, 97% of which have been defined as mild. Among the severe or critical cases, the overwhelming majority affects people aged 50 and above. By contrast, the death rate among people at reproductive age is 0.2%, with an estimated 1.5:1 male to female ratio, mainly affecting those with pre-existing conditions, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, obesity, hypertension, and cancer [3] .",

Globally, ART babies represent about 0.3% of the total live birth rate every year [5, 8]. Presently, we do not know how long the suspension of fertility treatments will last; however, estimates ranging from 3 to 12 months or even longer have been suggested, depending on how effective governments implement quarantine measures and how long it takes to acquire herd immunity. Thus, the number of infants expected to be conceived and born \u2013but who will be so due to the lockdown of infertility services\u2013 might be as significant as the total number of deaths attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The implications of postponing ART treatment under these circumstances demand significant attention. Notably, the probability of embryo euploidy, i.e., having an exact multiple of the haploid number of chromosomes, declines sharply after the age of 34 years and is overall lower than 50% for this subgroup (Supplementary Figure 1) [9]. At ages 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, and 40 years, the relative loss in embryo euploid probability from the previous year is 6.7, 8.2, 9.8,11.6, 13.6, and 15.7%, respectively (Supplementary Figure 2) [9].",

The primary aim of the Poseidon criteria was to provide patient counselling and clinical guidance regarding interventions that could help these patients conceive in the shortest possible time. The most vulnerable Poseidon patients are those within groups 2 and 4, i.e., ageing patients 35 years or above, with (i) an unexpected suboptimal number of oocytes retrieved in a previous ART cycle despite a normal ovarian reserve (group 2), or (ii) low ovarian reserve in whom the number of oocytes resulting from ovarian stimulation is invariably low (group 4) [12, 15, 16]. The reason relates to the impact of maternal age and number of oocytes on the availability of euploid embryos, and thus, live birth. In particular, Poseidon group 4 patients are running out of time, and any further delay in treatment might imply the loss of a future opportunity to obtain a biological child. Indeed, the percentage of initiated ART cycles resulting in a live birth is estimated to be 41.5% in women younger than 35 years; however, these numbers dramatically decrease with ageing, being less than 5% in women above 40 years [17].",

Immediate oocyte or embryo cryopreservation could represent the only opportunity to obtain a pregnancy after the end of gonadotoxic treatment. At present, the prevailing consensus is to allow fertility preservation programs to continue for oncological patients. On the other hand, more prudence concerning embryo transfer is proposed. Notably, as new scenarios emerge, even embryo transfer could be challenging to postpone in some specific subgroups of patients. For instance, in women with endocrine responsive breast cancers, an international panel of oncologists have proposed a temporary interruption in endocrine therapy to allow patients to obtain natural or assisted conception [20, 21]. In these women, the full course of endocrine therapy, which for some cases might be at least 5\u201310 years, could dramatically decrease natural fecundity after finalisation of therapy. According to the POSITIVE trial approach, the therapeutic suspension \u2018window\u2019 should not be longer than 24 months to allow patients to conceive and deliver [20]. If no conception occurs, patients must restart adjuvant therapy. If such an approach is validated, and importantly, the trial is still ongoing, every strategy to obtain a pregnancy within this short timeframe, including IVF and embryo transfer, should be considered without further delay.",

A classic example includes systemic autoimmune diseases (SADs), which are not uncommon in women of reproductive age. In these patients, the chronic inflammation might affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and the ovaries directly, causing impairment of the ovarian reserve [22\u201324]. Moreover, gonadotoxic drugs (e.g., alkylating agents) and teratogenic agents (e.g., Mycophenolate mofetil) are commonly used to control the inflammatory processes in patients with SADs. In these patients, fertility preservation is conditioned to the \u201cremission window\u201d [25]. In other words, the inflammatory process has to be restrained before ovarian stimulation and pregnancy can be considered. Thus, it has been recommended that women with SADs (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, mixed connective tissue disease, idiopathic inflammatory myopathies and vasculitis, among others) only embark on ART after at least 6 months of clinical remission has elapsed [25]. Several patients with SADs seeking fertility might have been planning this \u2018window\u2019 for a considerable time, which unfortunately occurred during the COVID-19 crisis \u2013postponing IVF in these patients compromises their reproductive chances considerably.",

Due to the fact that Poseidon group 3 patients are younger than 35 years and, therefore, the oocyte/embryo euploidy rate is over 50%, the number of oocytes required to have at least one euploid embryo in these patients is lower than in older patients (e.g., 35 years and older) in whom the oocyte/embryo euploidy rate is below 50% overall (e.g., Poseidon groups 2 and 4). Nevertheless, it is not unlikely that when the ovarian reserve is dramatically reduced, the remaining window to respond to ovarian stimulation is narrow. In reality, this scenario is not very different from the pre-chemotherapy situation. On this basis, we believe that Poseidon group 3 patients should be allowed the same permissive approach for fertility preservation as suggested for women who need to undergo chemotherapy.",

Thus, we propose that these services are not restricted to oncological patients only.Telehealth and phone counselling for infertile patients should be encouraged.Face to face visits should be limited for infertile patients who demand immediate treatment. Proper personal protective equipment (PPE) should be used by patients and healthcare providers during care provision.ART treatment should be carried out, as much as possible, in free-standing medical facilities, avoiding the diversion of clinical resources, or reduction of hospital capacity that could otherwise be used to care for COVID-19 patients.In closed-controlled air systems, the airflow might produce an increase in the viral spread from potential asymptomatic patients. Thus, special attention should be given to air quality control, including the use of air filtration systems and air pressurization, particularly in surgical and laboratory areas [27].Adherence to regulatory infection prevention recommendations should be of utmost importance for patients and health practitioners [28]. This advice includes the use of appropriate PPE by staff, adherence to social distancing measures for staff and patients, and staggering appointments so that no patients are waiting together in the clinic waiting area.The importance of training of ART staff (clinicians, embryologists, nurses) on PPE needs and usage is stressed.Good standard laboratory practices should be strictly applied when handling gametes and embryos within the embryology and andrology laboratories.A thorough discussion between patients and health care professionals should be made for responsible shared decisions, and psychological support should be an option for those in need.Advanced planning should guide the restart of ART services. Working groups and quality managers should design scenarios on which patients to prioritize, how working lists should be filled and staff scheduling.",

Our recommendations are unlikely to create any further burden to the medical infrastructure as ART in the population mentioned above is virtually free of complications. We realize that much is unknown about the implications of COVID-19 for early- and late pregnancy, including maternal-fetal transmission and teratogenicity [29, 30]. However, pregnancy can act as a comorbidity, and we, therefore, currently recommend against conception by ART in most cases. However, it should also be acknowledged that new serology testing is being developed to help identify individuals who have had the infection and have recovered, suggesting that those people are now immune to the virus and could be allowed IVF treatment [31]. Likewise, as IVF health care professionals recover from COVID-19 infections and acquire immunity, there will be less risk of recommencing care, particularly in COVID-19 recovered patients. Along these lines, immune patients will have a low risk of pregnancy complications in the event of an embryo transfer, or of propagating the disease when attending a medical facility. Yet, the accuracy of these tests has been debated and it is still unclear how long any immunity lasts and if reinfection is possible [32].",

The dilemma of how ART services are restarted after the present lockdown is genuine, as every country will follow a different recovery curve. Importantly, it should be considered that contamination of patients and medical staff could occur with COVID-19 when ART care is restarted, particularly in the context of asymptomatic shedding. Thus, we reiterate the recommendations given above that care should only be restarted if social distancing can be maintained, proper PPE be available and used, areas regularly disinfected, and screening for signs and symptoms of the infection undertaken before allowing patients embark on ART treatments.",
