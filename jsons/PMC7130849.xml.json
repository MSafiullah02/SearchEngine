            "text": "Microorganisms have always been responsible for both high morbidity and mortality. Even today, new bacteria and viruses are discovered and old ones evolve to become a new problem, developing resistance to antibiotics or new lethal symptoms. Autopsies are important in the process of establishing cause of death [1], and though microbiological results and findings are often unspecific [2], they continue to be a valuable tool in the process of monitoring and identifying new infectious diseases [3]. Among the more recent are hanta virus pulmonary syndrome, West Nile virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [4]. Especially bacteriological postmortem changes have been investigated through many years, dating back to Norris and Pappenheimer in 1905 [5] who introduced bacteria in the mouth of corpses and later showed they could be found in lung tissue at autopsy. The aim of this study was to review the use of microbiological procedures and findings at our forensic institute.",

One should expect a mixed growth and not a single isolate bacteria [13].4.Contamination: Microorganisms are introduced into the tissue at time of sampling, and were not present in life.\n",

However animal experiments performed by Heimesat et al. [16] do show a rather large increase in bacteria in extra-intestinal tissue especially up to 72 h after death. Perhaps even more interesting, they observe a rise in extra-intestinal bacteria already five minutes after death. Maujean et al. report an interesting case in which Neisseria meningitidis was detected in a putrefied body after 10 days using molecular analyses [17]. Pryce et al. compared antemortem vs. postmortem sampling and concluded that postmortem sampling is as valuable as antemortem, when related to an infectious COD [18].

Considering that result and the literature on the subject [6], [23], one would suggest that CRP measurement is carried out at the beginning of the autopsy. This would give an early indication of a possible infection in cases where antemortem information does not suggest such, allowing for microbiological sampling before significant handling of the body and a hence reduced risk of mechanical contamination, both by direct transfer of bacteria and by displacement of bowel-near blood in arteries and veins.",
