A comparison of the diagnostic accuracy of MALDI-TOF-MS with liquid chromatography MS for influenza A, metapneumovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus suggested the latter may be superior.75 A potential and significant limitation of current MALDI-TOF-MS is that when a large mixture of bacteria are present, as occurs more commonly in hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-acquired pneumonia, the sensitivity and specificity become suboptimal.76\n",
