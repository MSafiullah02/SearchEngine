Besides the biological and epidemiological factors, a multitude of social and economic criteria also govern the extent of the coronavirus disease spread in the population. Consequently, there is an active debate regarding the critical socio-economic determinants that contribute to the resulting pandemic. In this paper, we contribute towards the resolution of the debate by leveraging Bayesian model averaging techniques and country level data to investigate the potential of 29 determinants, describing a diverse set of socio-economic characteristics, in explaining the coronavirus pandemic outcome. We show that the true mathematical model of the coronavirus outcome is constituted only of few determinants, but the extent to which each determinant is able to provide an adequate explanation varies between countries due to their heterogeneous socioeconomic structures. To understand the relationship between the socio-economic determinants in the specification of the true model we develop the coronavirus determinants Jointness space. In this space, the potential determinants are linked with each other by their ability to jointly explain the coronavirus outcome. As such the Jointness space can be efficiently implemented for developing socio-economic policies aimed at prevention of future epidemic crises. * This is a preliminary report.",

In the most severe cases there were even lockdowns -all citizens were prohibited from leaving their homes. This subsequently lead to a major economic downturn: stock markets plummeted, international trade slowed down, businesses went bankrupt and people were left unemployed. While in some countries the implemented restrictions had a significant impact on reducing the expected shock from the coronavirus, the extent of the disease spread in the population greatly varied from one economy to another, as illustrated in Fig 1. A multitude of social and economic criteria have been attributed as potential determinants for the observed variety in the coronavirus outcome. Some experts say that the hardest hit countries also had an aging population [2, 3] , or an underdeveloped healthcare system [4, 5] . Others emphasize the role of the natural environment [6, 7] . In addition, while the developments in most of the countries follow certain common patterns, several countries are notably outliers, both in the number of officially documented cases and in number of diseased people due to the disease.Having in mind the ongoing debate, a comprehensive empirical study of the critical socio-economic determinants of the coronavirus pandemic country level outcome would not only provide a glimpse on their potential impact, but would also offer a guidance for future policies that aim at preventing the emergence of epidemics.",

To construct the set of potential determinants we conduct a thorough review of the literature describing the social and economic factors which contribute to the spread of an epidemic. We identify a total of 29 potential determinants that describe a diverse ensemble of social and economic factors, including: healthcare infrastructure, societal characteristics, economic performance, demographic structure etc. To investigate the performance of each variable in explaining the coronavirus outcome measured either vie the number of coronavirus cases per million population (p.m.p.) or the number of coronavirus deaths p.m.p., we utilize the technique of Bayesian model averaging (BMA). BMA allows us to isolate the most important determinants by calculating the posterior probability that they truly regulate the process. At the same time, BMA provides estimates for their relative impact, while also accounting for the uncertainty in the selection of potential determinants [8] [9] [10] .",

As we will discuss in more detail in the sequel, we observe that some of these factors are related to the effect of size and influence in social interactions, as well as the investments in health resources. However, the primary analysis does not take into account for the inhomogeneity of the socio-economic nature of the countries, and thus can not capture (potentially) significant interactions between the potential determinants. To deal with this problem, we develop the coronavirus determinants Jointness space. The Jointness space models the interrelation between the potential determinants, and acts as a bridge between theoretical investigations and practical implementation for developing socio-economic policies. Using this space we find that there may be two efficient routes which can be used for advancing social and economic measures aimed at preventing the impact of future epidemic crises. We believe in the absence of realistic models that adequately cover all relevant aspects, this study provides the first step towards a more comprehensive understanding of the socio-economic factors of the coronavirus pandemic.",

The extent to which a disease spreads within a population is uniquely determined by its reproduction number. This number describes the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population in which all individuals are susceptible to infection [13, 14] . Obviously, its magnitude depends on various natural characteristics of the disease, such as its infectivity or the duration of infectiousness [15] , and the social distancing measures imposed by the government [1] . Also, it depends on a plethora on socio-economic factors that govern the behavioral interactions within a population [16, 17] .",

Mathematically, the index quantifies the average daily variation in government responses to the pandemic dynamics. As a measure for the daily variation we take the Oxford Covid-19 stringency index 2 . The Oxford Covid-19 stringency index is a composite measure that combines the daily effect of policies on school closures, reduction of internal movement, travel bans and other similar restrictions. For each country, we construct a weighted average of the index from all available data since their first registered coronavirus case, up until the last date in which the daily stringency index is at most 80% the size of its maximum observed value. To emphasize the effect of policy restrictions implemented on an earlier date in calculating the average value, we put a larger weight on those dates. This is because earlier restrictions have obviously a bigger impact on the prevention of the spread of the virus. The procedure implemented to derive the average government stringency index is described in greater detail in Section S1 of the Supplementary Material (SM). Fig 3 visualizes the results from the baseline model. We observe that the countries which had stringer policies also had less COVID-19 cases and deaths, as expected. In addition, the countries with longer duration of the crisis registered more cases and deaths per million population. ",

Variables such as GDP per capita have been used in modeling health outcomes, mortality trends, cause-specific mortality estimation and health system performance and finances [46, 47] . For poor countries, economic performance appears to improve health by providing the means to meet essential needs such as food, clean water and shelter, as well access to basic health care services. However, after a country reaches a certain threshold of development, few health benefits arise from further economic growth. It has been suggested that this is the reason why, contrary to expectations, the economic downturns during the 20th century were associated with declines in mortality rates [48, 49] . Observations indicate that what drives the health in industrialized countries is not absolute wealth or growth but how the nations resources are shared across the population [50] . The more egalitarian income distribution within a rich country is associated with better health of population [51] [52] [53] [54] . Finally, it is also known that in better economies there are greater trade interactions and people mobility, which may enhance the propagation of an transmitted disease [17, 22, 45, 55, 56] .",

While the PIP analysis provided a valuable insight into the overall importance of single determinants, it neglects the interdependence of inclusion and exclusion of determinants in a same model. A standard approach for resolving this issue is to conduct a statistical Jointness test. Jointness tests allow us to infer whether two determinants are complements, i.e., tend to be included together in models with high posterior probability, or substitutes, i.e., models with high posterior probability tend to exclude the joint inclusion of both determinants.",

In the network, the determinants which can be included in multiple models take a more central position, whereas the periphery is constituted of determinants whose credibility in explaining the coronavirus outcome mostly substitutes the effect of other variables. We observe that, in both coronavirus cases and deaths, there are two clusters of tightly connected determinants. In the first cluster there are two central nodes; the population size and the government spending for the coronavirus cases model, and the mortality from non-natural causes and government spending for the coronavirus deaths model; which are connected to many other determinants. These determinants (depicted in the upper right corner of the two networks), in turn, are not connected to any additional determinants besides the two central ones. The second cluster consists of several determinants which are interconnected with each other, with the central role being played by the level of social connectedness and the religious views. Altogether, the Jointness space suggests that there are two routes for developing socio-economic policies aimed at preventing the impact of future epidemics. The first one is by developing policies to improve the aspects of the two central nodes in the first cluster, together with a (small) set of determinants belonging to the periphery of the network. The second route is by introducing measures to advance the characteristics of the determinants belonging in the second cluster.",

The two determinants strongly related to the coronavirus cases are the population size and the government health expenditure. More populated economies show greater resistance to being infected by the virus, whereas countries with larger government expenditure display greater susceptibility to the virus infection. Moreover, there is no determinant strongly related to the coronavirus deaths p.m.p.. A plentiful of reasons can be used as a possible interpretation for these results. For instance, it is known that in structured populations, the degree of epidemic spread scales inversely with population size [81] . This is because, everything else considered, in larger populations it is easier to identify and target the critical individuals that are susceptible to the disease [82] . It often turns out, that these are exactly the individuals which are more socially connected [83] . In a similar fashion, various explanations can be found for the observed effect of government health spending, such as the fact that larger government health spending also implies a more developed economy, which in turn suggests an older population and increased physical mobility. However, it could also be the case that more larger health spending leads to bigger testing power and thus providing better evidence for the coronavirus situation.",

Among these reasons is the fact that the spread of the coronavirus is obviously still in a transient regime. Even though, we include a proxy for the duration of the coronavirus pandemic in each country, this essentially hinders the development of a coherent modeling framework. Moreover, we include several potential determinants only through crude approximations. In particular, the level of social mixing is given via simple quantifiable measures. We do not follow the exact social network structures within a population [17] . These underexpressed effects may play a significant part in the final outcome of the coronavirus pandemic. It is evident that the heterogeneous socio-economic nature of the countries has an essential role in propagation of the coronavirus. We observed this feature when we discovered that the \"true\"' model of the coronavirus outcome is constituted of only few determinants, but different models may offer a credible explanation for it. In the absence of a unifying framework covering the relevant aspects of the interrelation between the potential determinants, the constructed coronavirus determinants Jointness space acts as the starting point for the development of a more comprehensive understanding of the socio-economic factors of the coronavirus pandemic. We believe that with the availability of new data and the improved understanding of the dynamics of the coronavirus pandemic, some of these shortcomings will be overcome, yielding a more reliable interpretation of the results.",

The current results were made with data gathered on 3rd May 2020. The data used for measuring the possible socio-economic determinants are gathered from 8 various sources. In particular, the collection is as follows: 20 determinants are from the World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI), 3 determinants are from the Nationmaster database (NM) and there is 1 determinant from the World Governance Indicators (WGI), the Worldometers database (WM), Data For Good (DFG), the State of Global Air (SGA), the Global footprint network (GFN) and from the United Nations (UN) database. Five of the potential were constructed by deriving our own index with data taken from the described source. The construction procedure for each of these variables is described in the following subsection. The full list of sources together with links to their websites is given in Table S1 . To reduce the noise from the data we restrict to using only countries with population above 1 million. In addition, we only use countries for which there is data on all of the potential socioeconomic determinants. Table S2 gives the countries for which all of these data was available. Altogether, we end up with data on 29 variables and 97 countries. Table S3 reports the summary statistics of each variable.

By assuming a prior model probability P(M m ) we can implement the same rule to evaluate the posterior probability that model M m is the true one, asP(M m |y) = f (y|M m )P(M m ) f (y) = f (y|M m )P(M m ) \u2211 2 k n=1 f (y|M n )P(M n ) .(S5)The term f (y|M m ) is called the marginal likelihood of the model and is used to compare different models to each other. The posterior model probability can also be written as m0 is the Bayes information criterion between model M m and the baseline model M 0 . In our case this is the model including government social distancing measures and the length of the coronavirus crisis in the country.With this setup, we can define the posterior distribution of \u03b2 as a weighted average of the posterior distributions of the parameters under each model using the posterior model |y, M m )P(M m |y).",
