Their genomes have three open reading frames (ORFs) organized from 5' to 3' as follows: ORF 1a, which encodes a serine protease; ORF1b, which encodes the RNA dependent polymerase; and ORF 2, which encodes the structural proteins. A frameshift must occur during the translation of ORF1a in order for ORF1b to be translated. ORF 2 is translated from a sub-genomic RNA and produces a polyprotein which is cleaved by cellular proteases [1].",

In children, rotaviruses, caliciviruses, adenoviruses and astroviruses are responsible for the greatest proportion of cases [5,6,12-14]. Most epidemiological studies fail to identify an etiologic agent in ~40% of diarrhea cases [15-19]. Recently, we conducted viral metagenomic analysis of diarrhea samples using a mass sequencing approach with the explicit goal of identifying novel viruses that may be candidate causes of diarrhea. One of the stool samples we analyzed was collected in 1999 at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne, Australia from a 3-yr old boy with acute diarrhea. Seven sequence reads were identified in this sample that shared \u2264 67% amino acid identity to known astrovirus proteins, suggesting that a novel astrovirus was present in the sample [20]. In this paper, we report the full sequencing and characterization of the genome of this astrovirus, referred to hereafter as astrovirus MLB1 (AstV-MLB1).",

In this study, the complete genome of the astrovirus present in the original stool specimen was sequenced to an average of >3\u00d7 coverage [GenBank: FJ222451]. The virus has been tentatively named Astrovirus MLB1 (AstV-MLB1). Analysis of the genome showed that AstV-MLB1 has the same genomic organization as other astroviruses. Like other astroviruses, the AstV-MLB1 genome was predicted to encode three open reading frames (ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2) and contained both 5' and 3' non-translated regions (NTR), as well as a poly-A tail. The complete genome length of AstV-MLB1 was 6,171 bp, excluding the poly-A tail, slightly shorter when compared to other astrovirus genomes which range in size between ~6,400 and 7,300 bp [1]. A comparison of AstV-MLB1 genomic elements with those of fully sequenced astroviruses is shown in Table 1.",

The residues RTQ which have been suggested to be involved in substrate binding are conserved among the human astroviruses, but vary in other viruses which have the 3C-like motif [21].

A bipartite NLS is characterized as having two regions of basic amino acids separated by a 10 aa spacer. The protein alignment of ORF1a revealed that AstV-MLB1 has a sequence motif similar to the putative NLS of human astroviruses. This region of the genome has also been predicted to potentially encode for a viral genome-linked protein (VPg) [23]. The high sequence similarity observed between AstV-MLB1 and other astroviruses in the motifs identified as essential for a putative VPg suggests that AstV-MLB1 may also encode a VPg (data not shown). While no experimental data exists supporting the prediction of the presence of a Vpg being encoded in any of the astrovirus genomes, we should note that we did encounter difficulty in obtaining the 5' end of the MLB1 genome until treatment of the RNA with proteinase K prior to RNA extraction was added to the experimental protocol.",

This deletion falls within a 144 aa region that has been mapped as being an immunoreactive epitope in human astroviruses [24] and is located in the non-structural protein p38 [21].

The predicted start position of ORF1b was then determined by selecting the first amino acid in frame with the slippery sequence. The 1b open reading frame of astroviruses encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP).

Alternately, it may be a passenger virus present simply as a result of dietary ingestion, as has been described previously for plant viruses detected in human stool [34]. Of course, viruses derived from dietary intake that appear to cause human disease, such as Aichi virus, have been described previously [35,36]. Another possibility is that this virus may represent zoonotic transmission from some other animal species that is the true host for Astrovirus MLB1. Traditionally it has been thought that astroviruses have a strict species tropism. However, recent evidence has emerged that suggests that interspecies transmission does occur. For example, chicken astrovirus antibodies have been detected in turkeys [37] and an astrovirus was isolated from humans whose capsid sequence most closely resembled that of feline astrovirus[1]. Because of the uncertainty as to the identity of the true host species and the host range for this virus, we have tentatively named this novel virus Astrovirus MLB1 (AstV-MLB1).
