            "text": "In viruses an increased coding ability is provided by overlapping genes, in which two alternative open reading frames (ORFs) may be translated to yield two distinct proteins. The identification of signature sequences in overlapping genes is a topic of particular interest, since additional out-of-frame coding regions can be nested within known genes. In this work, a novel feature peculiar to overlapping coding regions is presented. It was detected by analysis of a sample set of 21 virus genomic sequences and consisted in the repeated occurrence of a cluster of basic amino acid residues, encoded by a frame, combined to a stretch of acidic residues, encoded by the corresponding overlapping frame. A computer scan of an additional set of virus sequences demonstrated that this feature is common to several other known overlapping ORFs and led to prediction of a novel overlapping gene in hepatitis G virus (HGV). The occurrence of a bifunctional coding region in HGV was also supported by its extremely lower rate of synonymous nucleotide substitutions compared to that observed in the other gene regions of the HGV genome. Analysis of the amino acid sequence that was deduced from the putative overlapping gene revealed a high content of basic residues and the presence of a nuclear targeting signal; these characteristics suggest that a corelike protein may be expressed by this novel ORF.",

            "text": "The genome of viruses often contains more coding information than a colinear relationship between nucleotide and protein sequences would suggest. An increased coding density is provided by overlapping genes, in which two alternative open reading frames (ORFs) on the same strand may be translated to yield two distinct polypeptide products. This pattern not only compacts the genetic information of a limited-size genome but also is a way to keep the expression of linked genes under the same regulatory control. The first overlapping-gene systems were identified in X174 and G4 bacteriophages and consisted of the genes E, B, and K being entirely nested within the D, A, and C genes, respectively (Barrell et al. 1976; Fiddes and Godson 1979) . Other overlapping-gene arrangements were then described in several families of both animal (Samuel 1989 and references therein) and plant viruses (Morch et al. 1988; Mayo et al. 1989; Beck et al. 1991) .",

            "text": "Severe evolutionary constraints should be imposed on a nucleotide sequence encoding two functionally unrelated proteins, as all silent third codon-position substitutions in a frame cause amino acid changes in the sequence translated from the +1 overlapping frame. A clear example of constrained evolution is given by the pattern of nucleotide substitutions occurring in the polymerase/ surface antigen overlapping genes of hepatitis B virus, as evidenced by an extensive phylogenetic analysis of 27 primate strains (Mizokami et al. 1997 ). An accurate elucidation of this kind of evolutionary pressures should also allow for the discovery of novel overlapping genes, hidden in viral genomic sequences. For example, a de-tailed analysis of the rates of substitution at the first, second, and third codon positions within the phosphoprotein gene of 18 vesicular stomatitis virus isolates led to identification of a short region with an extreme reduction of third-base variability (Bilsel et al. 1990 ). The speculation that this anomaly may be explained by the presence of a functional, one position-shifted frame was supported by the finding that this overlapping ORF actually encodes a small arginine-rich protein (Spiropoulou and Nicol 1993) , for which a stimulating effect both on the level and on the fidelity of mRNA synthesis was then demonstrated (Peluso et al. 1996) . Based on a similar approach, a novel overlapping gene, essential for systemic virus spread in host plants, was shown to be highly conserved in cucumovirus, but absent in the other members of the Bromoviridae family (Ding et al. 1994 (Ding et al. , 1995 .",

Prokaryotic viruses were represented by single-stranded (SS) circular-DNA Escherichia coli bacteriophages, corresponding to X174, G4, and \u24233 species. Animal viruses included double-stranded (DS) circular-DNA hepatitis B virus (HBV) and both types of SS-RNA human immunodeficiency lentivirus. In particular, hepadnaviruses included three strains of avian HBV (two duck and one heron isolates) and the three major serological subtypes (adw4, ayw, and adr) of human HBV. Three HIV-1 strains (two Zaire and one Cambridge isolates) and three HIV-2 strains (two Rhodesia and one Mali isolates) were chosen as representatives of the lentivirus group of retroviruses. Plant viruses were given by six SS-RNA genomes, corresponding to members of luteovirus (barley, beet, and potato leafroll viruses) and tymovirus (eggplant, turnip, and ononis mosaic viruses) families. The entry names and the accession numbers of the 21 selected genomic sequences are as follows: PHIX174; M10867, MIG4XX;  V00657, BACHALPA; X60322, HBDGA; M21953, HBDGENM;   M95589, HBHCG; M22056, HBVADW4A; X69798, HBVAYWCI;  X65258, HPBCG; D12980, HIVBRUCG; K02013, HIVNDK;  M27323, HIVCAM1; D10112, REHIV2NI; J03654, HIV2RODZ;  M15390, HIV2BEN; M30502, BYDCG; L25299, BWYVFL1;  X13063, PLLGRNA; X14600, MTYRPVP; J04374, TYMVCG;  X16378, MTYCG; J04375. Referring to position coordinates featured in the database, the nucleotide sequences of overlapping and nonoverlapping coding regions were extracted from each of the examined genomes as separate entities, and the corresponding amino acid sequences were obtained. A k-tuple statistical analysis was carried out by the chi-square contigency-table test (Snedecor and Cochran 1967) , to assess for significant differences between the compositions of overlapping and nonoverlapping protein sequences at individual amino acid (k \u202b\u05e1\u202c 1), dipeptide (k \u202b\u05e1\u202c 2), and tripeptide (k \u202b\u05e1\u202c 3) levels. Bias in the use of synonymous codons was tested by estimating the \"effective number of codons\" (N c index) for a given amino acid residue (Wright 1990 ). The multiple alignment of nucleotide sequences was carried out using the computer program CLUSTAL W (Thompson et al. 1994) . The evolutionary distance between two protein coding sequences was evaluated by the method of Nei and Gojobori (1986) : the fraction of synonymous differences was first estimated, and the number of synonymous substitutions per site between the two compared sequences was then obtained using the K s index. The statistical comparison among the K s index values obtained from different sets of homologous sequences was carried out using the nonparametric test of Wilcoxon (Siegel 1956 ). Management and retrieval of virus nucleotide sequences stored in the genetic database were carried out using facilities included in the software package PC/GENE Release 18.0 (Intelligenetics, Mountain View, CA).",

In the tymovirus group, the coding fraction provided by overlapping genes showed an intermediate content (48% of the total). The genome of tymoviruses contains a set of only three genes (Fig. 1) ; its notable level of overlap is due mainly to a gene which is entirely embedded within the replicase gene and encodes a cell-to-cell movement protein necessary for systemic spread of the virus in the plant host (Bozarth et al. 1992 ). The lowest content of amino acid residues encoded by bifunctional genes (17% of the total) was found in human HIV-1 lentiviruses, which show, however, the highest degree of genomic complexity. In addition to the retroviral ancestral genes (Gag, Pol, and Env), HIV-1 contains the Tat and Rev regulatory genes, as well as the short accessory Nef, Vpu, Vif, and Vpr genes ( Fig. 1 ). Beside several bicistronic regions, the most complex arrangement is given by the 3\u0408 terminal coding exons of the genes Tat and Rev; they overlap with one other and with the Env gene, leading to all three reading frames of this region being simultaneously expressed.",

In other words, the tendency of amino acids to originate short clusters of identical residues was tested as a feature peculiar to proteins encoded by overlapping genes.",

The statistical comparison was carried out at the mono-, di-, and tripeptide levels, using the chi-square contingency-table test. At a chisquare value of 3.84 (P < 0.05), very few amino acids matched all of the three imposed conditions, that is, a higher frequency of occurrence, in the overlapping set, at the individual, dipeptide, and tripeptide levels ( Table 1) . They corresponded to the sixfold degenerate leucine residue in bacteriophages and to the equally degenerate arginine residue in all of the other groups, with the exception of tymoviruses. A detailed analysis pointed out that the clusters of leucines peculiar to bacteriophages are specifically encoded by the overlapping genes E and K. In avian and human HBVs, repeated stretches of three or four consecutive arginines were localized in the overlapping fraction of both core-antigen and polymerase genes. In HIV-1 and HIV-2 lentiviruses, highly conserved polyarginine motifs were found in the Tat and Rev regulatory genes. In luteoviruses, the arginine-rich regions that are encoded by overlapping frames were localized within the 29-kD, 66-kD, polymerase, and coat proteins; in particular, a cluster of seven consecutive arginines was found in the coat protein of potato leafroll virus.",

Using the N c index of Wright (1990) , no bias was found in bacteriophages, where the E and K overlapping frames use five of the six Leu synonyms to express the corresponding leucine-rich regions (Table 2) . On the contrary, a relevant bias was found in the overlapping regions that encode the arginine clusters of HBV and lentivirus proteins; it was ascribed to a strong preference for AGA codon, with respect to the AGG codon, and to a low content of most of the CGX codons, due mainly to a selective pressure against the CpG dinucleotide in the entire genomic sequence (see last column in Table 2 ). Although to a lesser extent, similar restrictions in the use of Arg synonyms were also observed in luteoviruses, where, instead, no CpG suppression was observed.",

            "text": "Besides the repeated occurrence of the proposed motif in known overlapping genes, the computer analysis described above led to the detection of a new potential overlapping gene in hepatitis G virus (HGV). The first clue was the identification of an Arg-Arg-Arg/Asn-Glu-Asp motif in all of the 37 worldwide geographic strains of HGV, for which the complete genomic sequence (9 kb) was available. The Asn-Glu-Asp se-quence was found expressed by the region that encodes the nonstructural protein NS5A. Unexpectedly, the Arg-Arg-Arg sequence was deduced from an uncharacterized ORF, one position shifted with respect to the NS5A frame. By delimiting the boundaries of this ORF (an initiator ATG codon and a TAA stop codon), a 255-nt potentially coding region entirely nested within the NS5A gene was characterized. As shown in Fig. 2 , translation of this overlapping ORF would potentially give rise to a conserved arginine-rich protein, for which a bipartite nuclear targeting signal was predicted by a PROSITE database search (Hofmann et al. 1999) . The notion of a highly basic protein was supported by a relevant pooled content of Arg, His, and Lys basic residues (average frequency of 29.2%). When the consensus sequence of this putative protein was compared to the SWISS-PROT database, no significant similarity to known proteins was evidenced. By examining the aligned set of sequences (Fig. 2) , the evolutionary conservation of this additional ORF was apparent, in spite of Fig. 2 . Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences from the overlapping ORF of 37 HGV isolates. Boldface characters indicate a putative nuclear targeting signal. Asterisks correspond to perfectly conserved amino acid residues. Periods indicate similar amino acid residues, in accordance with the PAM scoring matrix (Dayhoff 1978 The speculation on the presence of a novel overlapping gene was also supported by an accurate evaluation of the evolutionary distance at synonymous sites among the 37 available HGV isolates. The genome of this virus is a positive-strand RNA, in which a single long ORF encodes a 2842-aa polyprotein. On the basis of a general similarity to the organization of hepatitis C virus, a genomic map of HGV was proposed by Erker and coworkers (1996) . It consists of eight distinct coding regions (E1, E2, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B), with the structural and nonstructural proteins positioned at the amino terminus and carboxy terminus of the polyprotein, respectively. If a functional ORF is truly nested within the NS5A coding region, a local high degree of sequence conservation should be detectable, as the third-base position in the NS5A reading frame coincides with the second-base position in the +1 overlapping frame. The nucleotide coding sequences of 37 HGV isolates were aligned, and the evolutionary constraints acting on the synonymous sites of each gene region were estimated by the K S index (Table 4 ). According to the hypothesis, the lowest mean value of the K S index (0.227) was found in the fraction of NS5A frame for which a dual coding ability was supposed. Interestingly, this K S value was about twofold and threefold lower than that obtained from the coding regions of the NS5A frame that are positioned downstream and upstream of the predicted region of overlap. Similarly, higher values of the mean number of silent substitutions per site were obtained from the remaining seven genes of HGV; they ranged from a K S value of 0.525 (NS5B frame) to a K S value of 0.757 (B frame). The significance (P < 0.001) of the lower variability at synonymous sites in the overlapping fraction of the NS5A gene, compared to each of the other genomic regions, was statistically demonstrated by the Wilcoxon test.",

To meet this objection, an analysis of the distribution of the synonymous variability was carried out along the entire HGV coding sequence by a window scanning of 85 codons (Fig. 3) . Indeed, three subregions with a highly decreased rate of synonymous substitutions were localized within the NS5B gene (a K S value of 0.251), the NS4A gene (a K S value of 0.296), and the E2 gene (a K S value of 0.330); a search for the presence of conserved potential coding regions in the respective +1 frames gave negative results. On the other hand, this search pointed out an extremely higher content of stop codons in the three subregions compared to the NS5A gene (Table 5 ). The hypothesis that this anomaly may be due to selective pressures acting on the NS5A gene to prevent the occurrence of a stop codon in the +1 frame was tested by a simulation approach. For each of the 37 HGV strains, 1000 nucleotide sequences giving a 2842-aa protein identical to the real polyprotein were generated by a computer program; the assignment of synonymous codons to degenerate amino acids was not random, being based on the overall codon usage pattern of all HGV strains. By considering the four subregions with the lowest level of variability (NS5A, NS5B, NS4A, and E2), the number of stop codons in the +1 frame of the real HGV sequence was statistically compared with the mean and standard deviation of the number of stop codons in the +1 frame of the computer-simulated sequences (Table 5 ). Using the z-score test, it was demonstrated that the number of stop codons in the +1 frame of the NS5B, NS4A, and E2 subregions does not differ significantly from that occurring in the simulated sequences (a z value lower than the critical threshold of 3 SD was obtained).

This is the case of bacteriophages, where striking differences between the codon usage strategies of overlapping and nonoverlapping coding regions have been documented (Pavesi et al. 1997) . Thus, the identification of discriminant features peculiar to overlapping genes is a crucial topic, since additional and potentially functional frames can be hidden in the vast amount of virus nucleotide sequence data. Some characteristics of both the heptanucleotide sequence of ribosomal slippage and the secondary structure around the frameshift signal have been described for various viral bicistronic mRNAs (Ten Dam et al. 1990) . A dissection of the signals that control initiation of translation has been performed using a plant luteovirus mRNA on which protein synthesis initiates at two out-of-frame AUG start codons (Dinesh-Kumar and Miller 1993) . The effects of both leader length and AUG codon context on the translational regulation of the p20/p21 bifunctional mRNA of cucumber necrosis virus have been elucidated (Johnston and Rochon 1996) .

By this analysis, a first discriminant feature of overlapping genes-the expression of short homopolymers of leucine or arginine residues-was documented (Table 1) . Interestingly, a relevant role in the infectious phase of the virus life cycle was previously ascribed to such sequence motifs. For example, the polyleucine region of the overlapping E protein of bacteriophages lies within a transmembrane domain causing host cell lysis (Buckley and Hayashi 1986) . The clusters of arginines contained in the core protein of hepatitis B virus are part of a signal that is involved in nuclear targeting of the protein (Eckhardt et al. 1991) . A similar function was documented for the polyarginine motifs occurring in the Tat and Rev proteins of lentiviruses (Truant and Cullen 1999) . A critical role in the recognition, and nucleocytoplasmic transport, of unspliced viral mRNAs was demonstrated for an arginine-rich domain located in the center of the Rev protein (Zapp et al. 1991) . Similarly, the trans-activation of viral gene expression by the Tat protein requires a conserved arginine-rich region, which is responsible for the specific binding to a RNA stem-and-loop structure (Delling et al. 1991) . In plant viruses, a deletion analysis encompassing the arginine-rich motif contained in the amino-terminal region of the coat protein pointed out a key role of this region in RNA packaging and spread of infection in the host (Rao and Grantham 1996) .",

It was detected in most of the overlapping genes belonging to a sample set of 21 viruses. When a larger set of data, including the complete sequence of 422 limitedsize viral genomes, was subjected to a computer search algorithm, this feature was found in other known overlapping-gene systems and appeared as a common characteristic of virus species having distantly related life cycles.

Based on the notion that HGV does not contain a clearly discernible core gene in its 5\u0408 genomic region , and also considering that flavivirus core proteins are usually highly basic, the above feature suggests that a core-like protein could be encoded by the newly identified ORF. However, the ability of the 5\u0408 region of HGV to encode a core protein was recently proposed by Xiang and co-workers (1998) . It was motivated by the conservation in five HGV strains of a short ORF (93 nt) which is in frame and upstream, with respect to the E1 protein coding region, and by a peptide immunoassay demonstrating the actual expression of this ORF. An accurate analysis at the 5\u0408 end of the 37 HGV isolates used in this study revealed a poor degree of conservation for this ORF, with premature termination codons occurring in 16 of 37 sequences. Therefore, the expression of the additional 5\u0408 region proposed by Xiang and coworkers could be related to a translation event, specific to some HGV strains, starting from an AUG upstream of the E1 frame, rather than to the encoding of a functional core protein. Alternatively, a core-like function was ascribed to an expressed ORF which was localized in the antigenome sequence of HGV . By a sequence analysis of the antisense genome of 37 HGV isolates, I found a strong evolutionary conservation of this ORF. Its product, a 118-aa protein showing rich hydrophilicity, showed nearly half the content of basic residues (15.6%) compared to that occurring in the amino acid sequence from the ORF predicted here (29.2%). This observation, together with the presence of a bipartite nuclear targeting sequence, could favor the hypothesis of more striking core-like characteristics for the ORF identified in this work.",

Interestingly, the ratios between the K S value of the presumed region of overlap (NS5A gene) and the K S values of the remaining HGV genes are well comparable to those previously observed using the well-known overlapping and nonoverlapping coding regions of human HBV (Mizokami et al. 1997) . By a simulation approach, selection pressures affecting the codon usage pattern of the NS5A gene, and thus preventing the occurrence of stop codons in the +1 frame, were evidenced.
