As with previous infectious disease outbreaks\u2014HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory stress (SARS) disorder, pandemic flu and most recently Ebola\u2014Zika will spark an international race to develop new vaccines. The problem is that vaccines can take over a decade to develop. The development of new biomedical countermeasures\u2014vaccines, therapies and diagnostic\u2014requires the coordination of a wide number of institutional and industry actors to succeed. We argue here that international efforts to develop countermeasures for emerging infectious diseases should build on lessons learned from US programs to develop closely related biodefense products.",

For instance, SARS claimed fewer than 800 lives and cost the global economy nearly $40 billion1. Ebola, with over 11,000 deaths, sapped $6 billion out of West African economies and cost international donors $4.3 billion2,3. By comparison, the highest estimated cost for developing a new vaccine is $1.8 billion, with some experts arguing that the true cost is closer to $500 million4. Even so, not all novel agents give rise to large outbreaks, and emerging infectious diseases typically smolder in developing countries that do not command the attention of profit-driven pharmaceutical companies. Even if we knew which countermeasures to develop, how would we incentivize their development?",

By guaranteeing a market for their products, Project BioShield attracted a number of small and mid-size biotech firms. Unfortunately, it was not able to recruit large pharmaceutical firms capable of end-to-end product development. The smaller companies that did participate often lacked the technical, managerial or regulatory experience required to translate their ideas into products. To address these gaps, in 2006, the US Congress established the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). BARDA has since taken the lead within the US government for the advanced research and development of countermeasures for civilian populations, working directly with contractors in industry and academia to provide technical, operational and managerial support.",
