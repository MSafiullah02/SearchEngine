This study proposed a novel and easy-to-calculate prediction score using clinical and point of care laboratory findings in patients with abdominal trauma (AT). Methods Patients with AT admitted to a trauma center in Qatar between 2014 and 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. The FASILA score was proposed and calculated using focused assessment with sonography in trauma (0 = negative, 1 = positive), Shock Index (SI) (0 = 0.50-0.69, 1 = 0.70-0.79, 2 = 0.80-0.89, and 3 C 0.90), and initial serum lactate (0 B 2.0, 1 = 2.0-4.0, and 2 C 4.0 mmol/l). Outcome variables included mortality, laparotomy, and massive blood transfusion (MT). FASILA was compared to other prediction scores using receiver operating characteristics and areas under the curves. Bootstrap procedure was employed for internal validation. Results In 1199 patients with a mean age of 31 \u00b1 13.5 years, MT, MT protocol (MTP) activation, exploratory laparotomy (ExLap), and hospital mortality were related linearly with the FASILA score, Injury Severity Score, and total length of hospital stay. Initial hemoglobin, Revised Trauma Score (RTS), and Trauma Injury Severity Score (TRISS) were inversely proportional. FASILA scores correlated significantly with the Assessment of Blood Consumption (ABC) (r = 0.65), Revised Assessment of Bleeding and Transfusion (RABT) (r = 0.63), SI (r = 0.72), RTS (r = -0.34), and Glasgow Coma Scale (r = -0.32) and outperformed other predictive systems (RABT, ABC, and SI) in predicting MT, MTP, ExLap, and mortality. Conclusions The novel FASILA score performs well in patients with abdominal trauma and offers advantages over other scores.",

            "text": "Uncontrolled bleeding is the leading preventable cause of death from trauma worldwide. Nearly half of all deaths within the first 24 h after trauma are caused by exsanguination and coagulopathy [1] . Massive transfusion (MT), defined as the transfusion of 10 or more units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) in 24 h [1, 2] , is required in 3% of patients with trauma. MT is usually unplanned and requires large quantities of blood; however, it is often the differentiating factor between life and death [1] . Delays in activating massive transfusion protocols (MTP) may adversely impact patients' outcomes, while inappropriate activation may waste resources and incur costs to the institutions. Timely, sustained, and appropriate MTP activation remains a challenge to all trauma centers and the cost-effectiveness process [3] [4] [5] [6] .",

            "text": "MTP activation relies heavily on the subjective clinical judgment of initial vital signs and on the response to initial resuscitation. Various scoring systems have been proposed to identify patients in need of MT. Currently, there are nearly two dozen military and civilian prediction scores in the medical literature. However, no universal consensus has been reached, and none of them have been widely adopted [2] [3] [4] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Many scores use time-consuming laboratory tests along with physiologic and anatomical parameters [2-4, 7, 9-12, 14, 20] , whereas others use physiologic parameters along with point of care (POC) tests [8, 15, [17] [18] [19] . However, few of these scores are simple, efficient, and easy to remember and coincidentally are the ones most commonly used in practice. They include the Assessment of Blood Consumption (ABC) score, mostly for penetrating trauma, the Shock Index (heart rate/systolic blood pressure), and the Revised Assessment of Bleeding and Transfusion (RABT) score [8] . However, these scores have several limitations.",

We hypothesized that the incorporation of focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST), SI, and serum lactate into one scoring tool (the FASILA score) would provide an accurate, simple, and easy-to-remember scoring system, offering superior outcomes compared to other prediction scores. FAST is a routine, primary adjuvant test to detect blood in the peritoneum in abdominal trauma. FAST positivity or negativity, and/or the number of positive regions, are well-known determinants of MT requirements [3, 8, 9, 23] . However, the accuracy of FAST depends on the technical skill of the operator and on patient-related factors including obesity.",

In addition to being an acronym for FAST ? SI ? lactate, the word FASILA also means bud or sprout (palm-cutting) in Arabic. The present study has several key findings. The FASILA score correlates well with the commonly used contemporary scores such as the RABT, ABC, and SI, in predicting blood transfusions and outcomes in trauma. However, FASILA outperforms these scores in patients with both blunt and penetrating abdominal trauma, with ease of calculation, higher AUC values, better discriminatory power, and internal validation This score reflects the current physiological and tissue perfusion status and correlates inversely with the pulse pressure, which is an important surrogate for the stroke volume. It may therefore be used subsequently as a tool to track the loss of blood volume in patients with trauma [32] . Additionally, the SI, as a component of the FASILA score, reflects the integration of the cardiovascular and sympathetic nervous systems and correlates well with the central venous oxygen saturation and early shock [33] [34] [35] [36] . Of note, SI is directly proportional to the FASILA score in our study. Compared to lower scores, a FASILA score of 4.5 and above was associated with a two-, three-, four-, and eightfold increase in MT, exploratory laparotomy, sepsis and mortality, and MTP activation, respectively. Moreover, a FASILA score of 4.5 doubled the duration of stay in the ICU and hospital. Compared to those who died after 1 week, 1/3 of patients who died in the first 24 h had significantly higher FASILA scores.",

There are many different approaches for early resuscitation of patients with trauma. This is reflected by the existence of almost 2 dozen of prediction scores for MT activation [26] . These scores share many similarities, particularly in the selection of variables used to calculate them. However, their performance is not comparable [26] . Such scores have been shown to outperform clinical judgment alone and may play a critical role in supporting the clinical decisionmaking [26] . Studies have shown that the SI has better predictive power than its individual components (HR, SBP) [28] . However, there is no consensus on the optimal cutoff value for SI and when it should be used. Notably, the most widely used scores such as the ABC and SI include few variables for calculation, and the components are easy to obtain in emergency settings; these factors account for their popularity [8] . The ABC score was developed and tested in patients with penetrating trauma, and it consequently has limited applicability in most patients with blunt trauma and in the elderly. In addition, it does not reflect the status of tissue perfusion on arrival. The ABC score does not rely on the SI, but on its separate components (not as a ratio). Recently, Schroll et al. [24] concluded that the SI outperformed the ABC score, being more sensitive and requiring less technical expertise in predicting the need for massive transfusion. The addition of pelvic fractures as a parameter in the SI and FAST systems increased the discriminatory power of the RABT score [28] . The RABT score has shown better sensitivity, specificity, and discriminatory power than the ABC score in predicting MT activation [28] . However, the RABT score relies on a single SI cutoff value ([ 1) and lacks utility as an instant tool for indicating tissue perfusion status. Notably, the FASILA involves four different cutoff values of the SI and three ranges of lactate levels.",

In the search for a simple and easy predictive score for MT in cases with predominantly blunt trauma, evidence such as this led to the development of the FASILA score. In addition to other laboratory findings such as base deficit (i.e., tissue hypoperfusion and anaerobic metabolism), the initial serum lactate level is a determining factor for MT [38] . The models of both, Vandromme and the Traumatic Bleeding Severity Score (TBSS) incorporated lactate [10, 23] . Vandromme used lactate levels of C 5 mmol/l as a criterion for MT along with values of SBP \\ 110 mm Hg, HR [ 105 bpm, INR [ 1.5, and Hb B 11 g/dl [10] . The TBSS includes 5 variables, namely age, SBP after rapid infusion of 1000 ml of crystalloid, results of the FAST scan, severity of pelvic fractures, and lactate concentrate on arrival; the maximum TBSS value is 57 points [23] . Compared to the FASILA score, this score needs a longer time to calculate as infusions, measurements of serum lactate (routine laboratory test; not a POC test), and assessment of the severity and class of pelvic fracture requires longer time. A recent study demonstrated that prehospital serum lactate levels were predictive of the need for resuscitative care in normotensive patients with trauma. However, it was not better than the SI as a predictive tool [39] .",

However, its accuracy is dependent on operator skills. Moreover, it cannot quantify the amount of bleeding; therefore, unless used along with other variables such as the vital signs and mode of injury, FAST has certain limitations in predicting MT. In our study, MT was given more in patients with positive FAST (35%) in comparison with 25% in patients with negative FAST, whereas in shock patients the proportion of MT was 46 to 51.5%, respectively. Rowell et al. [38] reported that FAST had a sensitivity of 62% and specificity of 83%, and therefore, in hypotensive patients with a negative FAST result, clinicians should still maintain a high index of suspicion for significant abdominal bleeding [40] . Do et al. [41] found that FAST could identify abdominal/pelvic bleeding in almost half of noncompressible torso hemorrhage (NCTH) patients, and this was not improved in patients with shock on arrival.",

Most patients included in this analysis had blunt trauma and were adult males-less than 10% had penetrating injuries, were female, or were of the pediatric age group (\\ 14 years old). The present study defined MT as the transfusion of 10 or more units of blood in the first 24 h, which is beset with limitations. Many authors have attempted to overcome the limitations of this definition including Savage et al. [42] that proposed instead the critical administration threshold (CAT). Regardless of the many limitations, 10 U/24 h still remains the most utilized definition for MT worldwide. We did not include severely injured patients who die or stop bleeding with less than 10 units of RBCs, but certainly qualify. We also do not have information on the hourly transfusion.",
