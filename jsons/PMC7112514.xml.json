            "text": "The most reliable and accurate way to evaluate the proliferation of T cells in response to either mitogens or antigens is to quantify DNA-synthesis (Hughes and Mehmet, 2003). Currently two methods are generally used, the DNA incorporation of either radioactive tritiated thymidine ([3H] TdR) or the fluorescently labeled thymidine analogue 5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (BrdU). BrdU labeling has been proven to be advantageous over [3H] thymidine labeling in many aspects. While equally sensitive, there is no need for specialized equipment and special care during handling with the fluorescent compounds. The fluorescent cells are not destroyed during the process allowing additional staining for membrane molecules (e.g. CD3 and CD8) and final analysis is done by flow cytometry (Huong et al., 1991, Motobu et al., 2002). At present, mainly [3H] TdR labeling is used for in vitro restimulation assays in cats. Therefore, FITC BrdU labeling would be an interesting alternative.",

A double staining for feline CD3 and CD8 was performed, to allow identification of proliferating CTL (CD8+) or CD8\u2212 T lymphocytes. All cells, both APC and lymphocytes, originated from PBMC stored in liquid nitrogen, thus bypassing the problem of repeated blood sampling. Subsequent flow cytometrical analysis allowed the specific identification of the subset of proliferating T cells. Both monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mDC) were used as APC. Additionally, the production of IFN-\u03b3, the signature molecule of Th1, was evaluated in the cell culture supernatant and compared with the degree of proliferation.",

Additional IFN-\u03b3 levels were determined in cell culture supernatant; all samples fell under the detection limit (Fig. 5\n). These results indicate that even weak responses induced by monocytes, known to be poor antigen presenters, can be detected in cats using the BrdU assay.",

Fig. 4B shows the detection of proliferating CD3+/CD8+ and CD3+/CD8\u2212 lymphocytes that were in co-culture with antigen-pulsed mDC. When inactivated viruses were used as antigen stimuli, all viruses induced significant proliferation (P\n \u2264 0.05) in the CD8+ T lymphocyte population while only inactivated FPV and FCV induced proliferation (P\n \u2264 0.05) in the CD8\u2212 T lymphocyte population. Although not significant, inactivated FeHV-1 did induce some proliferation in the CD8\u2212 T lymphocyte population. When infectious virus was used, a totally different pattern was detected. Infectious FPV and FeHV-1 caused severe suppression of proliferation (P\n \u2264 0.05) in both the CD8+ and CD8\u2212 population while infectious FCV strongly induced proliferation in the CD8\u2212 T lymphocyte proliferation. Additionally, IFN-\u03b3 levels were determined in the cell culture supernatant (Fig. 5). Significant production was seen in the presence of both infectious and inactivated FCV while significantly reduced production was seen with infectious FPV and FeHV-1. Although the production was not significant, some IFN-\u03b3 was detected in the presence of inactivated FPV and FHC. The concentration of IFN-\u03b3 was positively correlated with the proliferation response for all the tested viruses in the CD8\u2212 (r\n = 0.964; p\n = 0.003) as well as in the CD8+ population (r\n = 0.679; p\n = 0.11).",

Although all parameters play a crucial role in the development of an immune response, the proliferation of antigen-specific T lymphocytes is one of the first things to occur during a CMI (Berke and Clark, 2005).

The first aspect in the development of the assay was to minimize the background proliferation. This phenomenon is also known in other species but felids seem to be especially prone to this (Brenchley and Douek, 2004, Raulf-Heimsoth, 2008) (personal communication, Rochelle Mikkelsen). Optimal results were obtained when 0.5 \u00d7 106\n cells ml\u22121 were incubated in medium containing 5% FBS (Invitrogen 16000) and 0.05 mM ME and when cells were incubated with BrdU for 4 h before flowcytometric analysis. The assay was further simplified for practical use by freezing the cells from 1 blood sample in liquid nitrogen. This allowed the generation of APC and effector cells from the same sample, reducing the stress that accompanies repeated blood sampling or allowing analysis when only one blood sample is available. Like in human immunology, several precautions were taken into account in order to preserve the immunophenotypic characteristics (such as proliferation and IFN-\u03b3 production) (Bull et al., 2002, Disis et al., 2006). Cells were frozen immediately after isolation, they were kept at \u2212196 \u00b0C for the entire storage period and viability of thawed cells was routinely 80\u201390%.",

            "text": "BrdU analysis of lymphocyte proliferation, using monocytes as APC revealed overall little response to any virus, with the exception of a strong reaction to inactivated FCV in the CD8\u2212 T lymphocyte population. This correlates well with earlier research where proliferation signals were detected in whole and washed feline blood cultures that were stimulated with inactivated FCV (Tham and Studdert, 1987a). However, the same research group also found proliferation signals when stimulation occurred with inactivated FPV and FeHV-1, which could not be detected in our study (Tham and Studdert, 1987b, Tham and Studdert, 1987c). This might be due to the different virus inactivation methods that were used to produce virus antigens for restimulation. Tham and Studdert, 1987a, Tham and Studdert, 1987b, Tham and Studdert, 1987c used \u03b2-propiolactone, a chemical disinfectant that preserves most of the immunogenic properties of viral proteins but is very hazardous to work with. It is nowadays mostly replaced by other chemical compounds such as binary ethyleneimine (Larghi and Nebel, 1980). In our study, UV irradiation was applied to inactivate the viruses. Although this is a promising inactivation method that has been used frequently because it mainly targets the genome, there have been reports of structural modifications of viral proteins which can have an influence on the immunogenic capacities of the inactivated virus (Miller and Plageman, 1974). Another group found significant proliferation signals in response to FeHV-1 antigens, however, their method of vaccination and restimulation, using immune stimulating complexes and purified virus protein differed significantly from our method (Martina et al., 2001). In addition, their in vitro restimulation assay involved adding exogenous IL-2 to the incubation medium which could modify the response, especially since, in a normal response, activated lymphocytes produce their own IL-2 and thus stimulate their own proliferation. Furthermore, IL-2 addition has been shown to increase non-stimulated background proliferation (Chain et al., 1987, von Baehr et al., 2001). Overall, there is little data concerning in vitro restimulation techniques in cats and there is a large diversity in used protocols. This makes a comparison of results difficult.",

            "text": "There are a couple of possible explanations for the lack of proliferation when adding inactivated FPV and FeHV-1. There is an inherent difference in antigenic capacity depending on the virus inactivation method, as has been found for feline parvoviruses (Churchill, 1982). Inactivated herpes viruses (e.g. Epstein\u2013Barr virus and bovine herpes virus 1) have been found to be able to induce apoptosis in monocytes and regulate DC development (Li et al., 2002). Furthermore, when comparing proliferation responses to infectious and inactivated bovine herpesvirus 1, using DC and monocytes, the same absence of proliferation was noted when monocytes were used as APC (Renjifo et al., 1999). The authors reported that this was mainly due to a lower viability of monocytes and due to the inhibitory effects of the virion glycoprotein gD, which is also present in FeHV-1. All these facts might contribute to the absence of proliferation when adding inactivated FPV and FeHV-1. Earlier research in humans has shown that dendritic cells are much more capable of stimulating T lymphocytes in comparison to monocytes or macrophages (Steinman, 1991, Sallusto and Lanzavecchia, 1994). In order to better detect proliferation signals to virus antigens, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mDC) were generated by adding IL-4 and GM-CSF to the culture medium and used as APC in further experiments. Surface phenotyping of feline mDC was performed through labeling, quantifying and comparing surface molecules on monocytes, macrophages and mDCs. Generally, mDC stained brightest for CD14, MHCII, CD1a, and CD1b, followed by M\u0424 while monocytes were not or weakly stained for these surface markers. The same pattern was detected by other authors using feline mDC (Bienzle et al., 2003, Freer et al., 2005, Sprague et al., 2005) and is characteristic for the high antigen presenting capacity of mDC (Zhou and Tedder, 1996). In human immunology, mDC generally lose CD14 expression after differentiation in vitro (Sallusto and Lanzavecchia, 1994). This seems to differ from feline mDC since they stained very brightly for this glycosylphosphatidylinositol receptor. This had already been noted in earlier studies using feline mDC (Bienzle et al., 2003, Freer et al., 2005, Sprague et al., 2005) as well as porcine mDC (Carrasco et al., 2001) and mDC obtained from rhesus macaques (O\u2019Doherty et al., 1997). These differences in CD14 expression might be attributed to the use of certain monoclonal antibodies recognizing CD14 on monocytes but not on DC or M\u0424, a fact that has also been found for porcine cells. In addition, even when CD14 expression is detected, there could still be a cell type-dependent functional difference of the CD14 receptor (e.g. on porcine monocytes CD14 is a functional LPS receptor while this is not the case for CD14 on porcine mDC) (Carrasco et al., 2001). Similar to the work from Freer et al. (2005), size and granularity, assessed by forward and side scatter respectively (FSC-A and SSC-A), were found to be significantly higher for mDC when compared with M\u0424. Finally, the morphological analysis of both mDC (non-adherent, round shaped and presence of dendrites) and M\u0424 (tightly adherent, irregular shape and presence of pseudopodia) revealed characteristics similar to those reported in other studies on feline mDC generation (Bienzle et al., 2003, Freer et al., 2005, Sprague et al., 2005). BrdU analysis of lymphocyte proliferation, using mDCs as APC revealed proliferation signals for inactivated FeHV-1 in the CD8+ T lymphocyte population and for inactivated FCV and FPV in both the CD8\u2212 and CD8+ T lymphocytes population while infectious FCV caused significant proliferation only in the CD8\u2212 T lymphocyte population and infectious FPV and FeHV-1 seemed to suppress lymphocyte proliferation in both T cell populations. The highly pathogenic panleukopenia virus and the immune evasive felid herpesvirus both caused a severe suppression of proliferation during in vitro restimulation. This suppression of proliferation might be caused by certain immunosuppressive mechanisms of the viruses (e.g. down regulation of MHC-I expression with FeHV-1 (Montagnaro et al., 2009), suppression of proliferation after in vivo infection with FPV (Schultz et al., 1976)) or the death of infected cells (80% cell death after FeHV-1 infection in monocytes, results not shown). The fact that inactivated FeHV-1 and FPV do not seem to suppress proliferation indicates that none of the structural proteins are involved but that active infection needs to be present to elicit the immunosuppressive mechanisms.",

            "text": "Another aspect frequently investigated in veterinary immunology is the cytokine production in antigen-stimulated cell cultures (Sandbulte and Roth, 2004). In the complex realm of cytokines, interferons and especially IFN-\u03b3 are key molecules in the protection against viruses. IFN-\u03b3 is the signature molecule of the Th1 response, has antiviral capacities and is in the adaptive CMI response mainly produced by CD4+ T helper cell (Th1) and CD8+ CTL (Sen, 2001, Katze et al., 2002, Schroder et al., 2004). In order to verify the signals detected by the BrdU labeling method, IFN-\u03b3 was detected in the supernatant of the proliferation assay using a sandwich ELISA specific for the detection of feline IFN-\u03b3. IFN-\u03b3-levels were below the detection limit when monocytes were used as APC (results not shown). This absence of production together with the proliferation signal detected with infectious FCV might indicate that a Th2 response rather than a Th1 response is mounted. This hypothesis however, would need to be verified through the detection of typical Th2 cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13. Another interpretation might be the higher sensitivity of the BrdU labeling in comparison with the IFN-\u03b3 ELISA for the detection of Th1 biased CMI. If mDC were used however, there was a large similarity between detected proliferation signals and detected IFN-\u03b3 levels, indicating that, when using mDC as APC, the BrdU method is suitable for the in vitro evaluation of CMI responses to viruses.",

The use of mDC as APC is recommended since only low responses were detected when monocytes were used as APC. The obtained results were verified via the detection of IFN-\u03b3 in culture supernatant. In this study, the BrdU labeling method was used to evaluate and describe proliferative responses to FPV, FCV and FeHV-1, some of the most common viral infections in cats. In the future this will be extended to CMI-studies infected cats and other major feline pathogens such as feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Further, this method could be implemented in a bioassay-tool to evaluate CMI responses to other vaccines or to analyze the effect of drugs and other health-promoting products on CMI responses.",
