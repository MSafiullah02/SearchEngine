The first confirmed case of COVID-19 outside China was diagnosed on 13th January 2020 in Bangkok (Thailand) [8]. On the 2nd of March 2020, 67 territories outside mainland China had reported 8565 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 132 deaths, as well as significant community transmission occurring in several countries worldwide, including Iran and Italy and it was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on the 11th of March 2020 [9]. The number of confirmed cases is constantly increasing worldwide and after Asian and European regions, a steep increase in cases is currently (31 March 2020) being observed in low-income countries [10]. It is problematic to quantify the exact size of this pandemia as it would necessary to count all cases including not only severe and symptomatic cases but also mild ones [11]. Unfortunately, to date, there is not a global and standard response to the pandemia and each country is facing the crisis based on their own possibilities, expertise and hypotheses. Thus, there are different criteria for testing, hospitalisation and estimating of cases making it difficult to calculate the number of people affected by epidemic. Based on the data we have so far, the estimated case fatality ratio among medically attended patients is approximately 2%, but, also in this case, a true ratio may not be known for some time [12].",

            "text": "To address the pathogenetic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, its viral structure and genome must be considered. Coronaviruses are enveloped positive strand RNA viruses with the largest known RNA genomes\u201430\u201332 kb\u2014with a 5\u2032-cap structure and 3\u2032-poly-A tail. Starting from the viral RNA, the synthesis of polyprotein 1a/1ab (pp1a/pp1ab) in the host is realized [14]. The transcription works through the replication-transcription complex (RCT) organized in double-membrane vesicles and via the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) sequences. Of note, transcription termination occurs at transcription regulatory sequences, located between the so-called open reading frames (ORFs) that work as templates for the production of subgenomic mRNAs [15]. In the atypical CoV genome, at least six ORFs can be present. Among these, a frameshift between ORF1a and ORF1b guides the production of both pp1a and pp1ab polypeptides that are processed by virally encoded chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) or main protease (Mpro), as well as one or two papain-like proteases for producing 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) [15]. Apart from ORF1a and ORF1b, other ORFs encode for structural proteins, including spike, membrane, envelope, and nucleocapsid proteins and accessory proteic chains [14,15]. Different CoVs present special structural and accessory proteins translated by dedicated sgRNAs. Pathophysiology and virulence mechanisms of CoVs, and therefore also of SARS-CoV-2 have links to the function of the nsps and structural proteins. For instance, research has underlined that nsps are able to block the host innate immune response [16]. Among the functions of the structural proteins, the envelope has a crucial role in virus pathogenicity as it promotes viral assembly and release.",

The data so far available seem to indicate that the viral infection is capable of producing an excessive immune reaction in the host. In some cases, a reaction takes place, which as a whole is labelled a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d. The effect is extensive tissue damage. The protagonist of this storm is interleukin 6 (IL-6). IL-6 is produced by activated leukocytes and acts on a large number of cells and tissues [17]. It is able to promote the differentiation of B lymphocytes, promotes the growth of some categories of cells, and inhibits the growth of others. It also stimulates the production of acute phase proteins and plays an important role in thermoregulation, in bone maintenance and in the functionality of the central nervous system [18]. Although the main role played by IL-6 is pro-inflammatory, it can also have anti-inflammatory effects. In turn, IL-6 increases during inflammatory diseases, infections, autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular diseases and some types of cancer [19]. It is also implicated into the pathogenesis of the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) that is an acute systemic inflammatory syndrome characterized by fever and multiple organ dysfunction [20].",

Asymptomatic infections have also been described, but their frequency is unknown. The main symptoms are reported in Table 1. Pneumonia appears to be the most frequent serious manifestation of infection, characterized primarily by fever, cough, dyspnea, and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging.

Other, less common symptoms have included headaches, sore throat, and rhinorrhea. In addition to respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea and diarrhea) have also been reported, and in some patients they may be the presenting complaint.

Chest CT abnormalities are more likely to be bilateral, have a peripheral distribution, and involve the lower lobes. Less common findings include pleural thickening, pleural effusion, and lymphadenopathy [24]. Chest CT may be helpful in making the diagnosis, but no finding can completely rule in or rule out the possibility of COVID-19. The possibility of COVID-19 should be considered primarily in patients with new onset fever and/or respiratory tract symptoms (e.g., cough, dyspnea) [23,24,25]. It should also be considered in patients with severe lower respiratory tract illness without any clear cause. Although these syndromes can occur with other viral respiratory illnesses, the likelihood of COVID-19 is increased if the patient [26]: (1) resides in or has travelled within the prior 14 days to a location where there is community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., large numbers of cases that cannot be linked to specific transmission chains); (2) has had close contact with a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19 in the prior 14 days, including through work in health care settings. Close contact includes being within approximately six feet (about two meters) of a patient for a prolonged period of time while not wearing personal protective equipment or having direct contact with infectious secretions while not wearing personal protective equipment.",

In patients with COVID-19, the white blood cell count can vary. Leukopenia, leukocytosis, and lymphopenia have been reported, although lymphopenia appears most common [30,31]. Elevated lactate dehydrogenase and ferritin levels are common, and elevated aminotransferase levels have also been described. On admission, many patients with pneumonia have normal serum procalcitonin levels; however, in those requiring ICU care, they are more likely to be elevated. High D-dimer levels and more severe lymphopenia have been associated with mortality. Imaging findings\u2014Chest computed tomography (CT) in patients with COVID-19 most commonly demonstrates ground-glass opacification with or without consolidative abnormalities, consistent with viral pneumonia. Others study have suggested that chest CT abnormalities are more likely to be bilateral, have a peripheral distribution, and involve the lower lobes. Less common findings include pleural thickening, pleural effusion, and lymphadenopathy [23,24,25]. Chest CT may be helpful in making the diagnosis, but no finding can completely rule in or rule out the possibility of COVID-19.",

Expectorated sputum should be collected from patients with productive cough; induction of sputum is not recommended. A lower respiratory tract aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage should be collected from patients who are intubated. Data from this study suggested that viral RNA levels are higher and more frequently detected in nasal compared with oral specimens, although only eight nasal swabs were tested. SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [33]. A positive test for SARS-CoV-2 generally confirms the diagnosis of COVID-19, although false-positive tests are possible. If initial testing is negative but the suspicion for COVID-19 remains, the WHO recommends resampling and testing from multiple respiratory tract sites [34]. The accuracy and predictive values of SARS-CoV-2 testing have not been systematically evaluated. Negative RT-PCR tests on oropharyngeal swabs despite CT findings suggestive of viral pneumonia have been reported in some patients who ultimately tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Serologic tests, once generally available, should be able to identify patients who have either current or previous infection but a negative PCR test [35,36]. Coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses, including influenza, has been reported, and this may impact management decisions.",

At the moment, there is no vaccine available and the best prevention is to avoid exposure to the virus [60]. In order to achieve this goal, the main measures are the following: (1) to use face masks; (2) to cover coughs and sneezes with tissues; (3) to wash hands regularly with soap or disinfection with hand sanitiser containing at least 60% alcohol; (4) to avoid contact with infected people; (5) to maintain an appropriate distance from people; and (6) to refrain from touching eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands [61] (Table 3). Interestingly, the WHO issued detailed guidelines including: (I) Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water; (II) Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth; (III) Practice respiratory hygiene covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze; (IV) If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early; (V) Stay informed and follow advice given by your healthcare provider; (VI) Maintain at least 1 m (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing [62]. In particular, regarding the use of face mask, health care workers are recommended to use particulate respirators such as those certified N95 or Filtering FacePiece 2 (FFP2) when performing aerosol-generating procedures and to use medical masks while providing any care to suspected or confirmed cases [63]. Moreover, while an individual without respiratory symptoms is not required to wear a medical mask when in public, people with respiratory symptoms are advised to use medical masks both in health care and home care settings [64].",

It is too early to forecast any realistic scenario, but it will have a strong impact worldwide. If high income countries, especially those already affected by the outbreak, seem to face a catastrophic perspective, in low-income countries there seem to be two possible scenarios. In particular, in the worst-case scenario, when the COVID-19 outbreaks, the majority of countries will be unprepared, with low resources allocated for affording the viral emergency and the consequences will be catastrophic. In the best case scenario, similarly to the global outbreak of the SARS-CoV in 2003, also the COVID-19 will not affect Africa or South America on a large scale suggesting that respiratory viruses spread more effectively in the winter and, therefore, the southern hemisphere will be affected later in the year, if at all [63]. To this could contribute also the climate-specific cultural differences (living more outdoors than indoors), the effect of UV light on the survival of the virus on surfaces, immunological differences of the population (innate immunity), preexposure with coronaviruses, or the higher temperatures [64]. This data was also indirectly supported by Chin and colleagues that artificially reproduced different environmental conditions in order to study the virus survival capacity [65]. In addition to this hopeful low impact, if the prevention measures will be implemented, we could register a lower incidence of hygiene-linked diseases that still represent leading causes of death [66].",
