            "text": "Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) is closely related to the health of building occupants, since on average, people spend more than 70 % of their time in homes, offices and other indoor environments (Zhong, Lee, & Haghighat, 2017). Nevertheless, the spread of infectious diseases in the indoor has seriously affected the IAQ and human health. Airborne transmission is the primary mode of transmission of many diseases such as tuberculosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza (Milton, 2012; Roy & Milton, 2004). The main feature of airborne transmission is that microbes can move along the air flow and consequently infect other people in a long distance. Infectious microbes can be released through a variety of mechanisms, such as physical contact and human respiratory behaviors (Xu & Liu, 2018; Tellier, 2006; Xu, Nielsen, Liu, Jensen, & Gong, 2017). The particle sizes of these released microbes are different, resulting in atypical movement patterns (Jurelionis et al., 2015; Xie, Li, Chwang, Ho, & Seto, 2007). Microbial droplets larger than 10 \u03bcm in diameter deposit rapidly due to gravity (Jiang, Yao, Feng, Sun, & Liu, 2017), while microbial aerosols smaller than 10 \u03bcm in diameter evaporate and shrink to droplets nuclei, with their particle size further reduced. These fine microbial aerosols could follow the indoor air currents and survive for long time (Lai, Cheng, & Lim, 2005; Morawska, 2006). They diffuse around people in the air and enter people's upper respiratory tract along with their respiratory airflow, which will eventually settle in the trachea or bronchus of mortal body (Koullapis, Kassinos, Bivolarova, & Melikov, 2016; Thomas, 2013). Some microorganism aerosols with extremely small diameter can be directly deposited in the alveoli of human body (Hinds, 1999). Accordingly, the accumulation rather than effective removal of contaminants indoors can bring harm to occupants\u2019 well-being (Hesaraki, Myhren, & Holmberg, 2015).",

These particles can be easily absorbed into the lower respiratory tract and therefore increases the risk of infection. When patients with communicable diseases release harmful aerosols through respiration in offices, wards, operating rooms and other places, the risk of infection of surrounding people will be increased. Therefore, it is of vital importance to better understand the diffusion behavior of aerosols generated by human respiration in order to reduce the risk of infection of susceptible population sharing the indoor environment.",

            "text": "Human microenvironment has a vital influence on the transmission of an airborne infectious disease. Human thermal plume (TP), as an important part of human microenvironment, has been widely studied by researchers (Licina, Pantelic, Melikov, Sekhar, & Tham, 2014; Melikov, 2015; Zukowska, Melikov, & Popiolek, 2012). Human TP refers to the airflow rising along the boundary of the human due to the temperature difference between the surface of the human and the surrounding air and the thermal buoyancy of the air. The maximum speed of TP is usually about 0.45 m above the head, with a value of about 0.24 m/s (Craven & Settles, 2006; Li, Liu, Wang, Jiang, & Cao, 2017; S\u00f8rensen & Voigt, 2003). TP carries particles from the lower part of the body into the respiratory area (Brohus & Nielsen, 1996), and also prevent particles generated by human respiration from penetrating out (Nielsen, Buus, Winther, & Thilageswaran, 2008). Human TP may have a positive impact on the diffusion of aerosols in a ventilated room, as it may make the dispersion of particulate matter more intense (Salmanzadeh, Zahedi, Ahmadi, Marr, & Glauser, 2012). Many previous studies have shown that the TP has a significant impact on the diffusion of particles. However, the quantitative relationship between the intensity of the TP and the degree of influence on particles has seldom been studied. The TP at higher room temperature has different characteristics from that at lower room temperature (Ge, Li, Inthavong, & Tu, 2013; Voelker, Maempel, & Kornadt, 2014), so it may have distinct effects on the diffusion law of particles. Therefore, the study of different intensities of TP is of huge significance to the study of the diffusion of aerosol produced by respiration.",

While small-scale vortices mainly play a role in dissipating function and affect various variables through dissipation pulsations. The shape and boundary conditions of the flow field influence the large-scale vortex. So, it has obvious anisotropy, while the small-scale vortex is almost not subject to the boundary conditions and flow field size, having approximate isotropy. Therefore, it is easier to establish a general model to simulate. LES distinguishes the large eddy from the small eddy, simulating large eddies by the direct solution to the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equation, and small eddies in the universal subgrid model.",

The particle is released from the nostril, travels in the direction of the airflow to the chest, and then diffuses upwards. The diffusion velocity of the particle is directly related to the airflow velocity of TP. The higher the velocity is, the farther the diffusion distance is, and the larger the diffusion velocity is. The particles produced by lying on your back spread more widely than the other two positions because of the larger range of TP. Similar to the distribution of the particles in the first two positions, the lower the room temperature is, the more the particles diffuse upward. However, despite the fact that at room temperature of 30 \u2103, the proportion of particles near the roof is still very high, at 32 %. The particulate matter near the roof counts for 61 % and 58 % in case 7 and case 8, respectively. The distribution of particle concentration has the same rule as the distribution of particle number. Maximum concentrations in case 7\u20139 are all found near the roof 3.4e-10 kg/m3, 1.9e-10 kg/m3 and 1.5e-10 kg/m3, respectively.",

(2014) reported a more detailed experimental study on TP, and obtained that the manikin in a sitting position generates more heat, which is similar to our simulation results. Based on the analysis they got this phenomenon is due to the effect of the TP produced by the thighs. However, we propose another explanation. TP is produced by convection of heat transfer between the surface of the manikin and the indoor air. The basic equation for convective heat transfer, Newton's law of cooling is as follows:(15)q = h(tw \u2212 tf)Where q is heat flux, W/m2, h is convective heat transfer coefficient, W/m2\u22c5k, t\nw is solid wall temperature, k, t\nf is fluid characteristic temperature, k. According to Newton's law of cooling, convection heat transfer is determined by the difference between solid surface temperature and fluid temperature and the convection heat transfer coefficient. According to the heat flow results in this study, the thermal conductivity per unit area of different postures is different at the same room temperature. For example, when the room temperature is 24 \u2103, the heat flux of the manikin in three postures is 10.63 W/m2, 16.55 W/m2 and 13.09 W/m2, respectively. Therefore, different postures mainly lead to the change of convective heat transfer coefficient, which leads to the difference of human heat flux.",

When the room temperature is 24 \u2103, the TP velocity near the surface of the sitting body is 0.15 m/s, with the same value which is 0.15 m/s for the standing posture.

According to the results of particle distribution, the velocity and influence range of TP both affect the velocity and quantity of particle upward diffusion to some extent.

Therefore, according to the diffusion law of particulate matter, the selection of appropriate ventilation can reduce its indoor stay time. When the room temperature is 24 \u2103 and 27 \u2103, the distribution of particulate matter generated by standing and sitting for human respiration is characterized by a higher concentration and more quantity near the roof. In order to eliminate these particles, the primary task of ventilation is to prevent the particles from returning to the breathing area, and the second is to effectively organize the airflow distribution around the roof to remove the vast majority of pollutants. Therefore, it is possible to produce positive effects by applying the displacement ventilation in the above situation. At room temperature of 30 \u2103, the TP of manikin has very little influence on respiratory airflow, and the particle hardly changes with the movement track of respiratory airflow. Sitting and standing manikin at this room temperature particle tends to gather in the chest, producing a higher concentration. In this case, it is more efficient and energy saving to deal with the distributed particles by local exhaust. The particles produced by people lying flat on their backs are usually more evenly distributed, with no particularly high concentration areas. In this case, mixed ventilation can reduce the overall concentration of particulate matter in the room and achieve the effect of energy-saving.",

By analyzing and summarizing the diffusion characteristics from convective heat transfer, the interaction between TP and respiratory airflow and the diffusion data of particles, the following conclusions were drawn:(1)Different postures mainly affect the convective heat transfer coefficient on the surface of human body, which leads to differences in the thermal conductivity of the human body. Such differences mainly affect the range instead of velocity of TP.(2)The difference in room temperature directly affects the convective heat transfer on the surface of human body, causing a huge difference in the velocity of TP near the surface of the human body. At different room temperature, the difference of thermal conductivity of human surface can be 3\u20134 times, and the difference of TP velocity can be 1\u20132 times.(3)The difference in the ability of TP to carry particles upward is mainly caused by the difference in heat flux. The greater the heat flux is, the greater the air flow flux of the plume is, and the greater the ability of the plume is to carry particles upward.(4)When the room temperature is 24 \u2103 and 27 \u2103, the TP generated by the human body in the standing and sitting positions has a strong ability to interfere with the respiratory airflow, and the respiratory airflow can hardly penetrate the TP. At room temperature of 30 \u2103, some particles can pass through the TP with the respiratory airflow. TP produced by the lying manikin slightly changes the direction of particle movement and promotes particle diffusion.\n",
