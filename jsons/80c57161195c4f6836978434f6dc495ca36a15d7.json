This includes enhancing viral macromolecular synthesis and assembly, as well as preventing antiviral responses, including intrinsic, innate, and adaptive immunity. There are numerous mechanisms by which viruses mediate their effects on the host cell, and this includes targeting various cellular post-translational modification systems, including sumoylation. The wide-ranging impact of sumoylation on cellular processes such as transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, stress response, and cell cycle control makes it an attractive target for viral dysregulation. To date, proteins from both RNA and DNA virus families have been shown to be modified by SUMO conjugation, and this modification appears critical for viral protein function. More interestingly, members of the several viral families have been shown to modulate sumoylation, including papillomaviruses, adenoviruses, herpesviruses, orthomyxoviruses, filoviruses, and picornaviruses.

They are also involved in the molecular mechanisms by which HPV hijacks the process of keratinocyte differentiation, leading to the pathology observed with common warts. In addition to E6 and E7, two other viral early proteins, E1 (Bergvall et al. 2013 ) and E2 (McBride 2013), are essential for normal viral replication.

E7 is an early papillomavirus protein that both helps drive the host cell into a proliferative state and counteracts innate immunity (Hebner and Laimins 2006) . A major target of E7 protein is the host pRB protein that regulates the activity of the host E2FE2F transcription factor (Roman and Munger 2013) . The papillomavirus E7 protein has an LxCxE motif that binds pRB (Munger et al. 2001) , and E7 binding inhibits sumoylation of pRB (Ledl et al. 2005) . Since sumoylation appears to reduce the repressive ability of pRB, interaction with E7 is likely to have functional consequences. Additionally, E7 also binds many other cellular targets (Wilson and Rosas-Acosta 2003) and might be able to modulate sumoylation of these proteins to more generally influence cellular protein functions. Interestingly, many of the functions of E7 are inhibited by the cellular tumor suppressor, p14ARF (Pan et al. 2003) , which is known to stimulate sumoylation of certain substrates (Rizos et al. 2005; Woods et al. 2004 ).

In a study published in 2006, Dejean's group showed that high risk HPV-E6, but not low risk E6, was capable of binding to and inhibiting PIASy activity (Bischof et al. 2006) . PIASy is a SUMO ligase which enhances sumoylation of specific substrates such as p53 (Schmidt and Muller 2003) , and E6 binding blocks sumoylation of PIASy-specific substrates. Functionally, since PIASy act as a promoter of cellular senescence (Bischof et al. 2006) , this inhibition of PIASy by E6 may contribute to the ability of E6 to inhibit cellular senescence. Although E6 binds to PIASy and inhibits its ligase activity, it does not target this enzyme for degradation like it does for p53 (Huibregtse et al. 1994) . Mechanistically, E6 may be acting simply by sequestering or blocking PIASy in the complex. Whether or not E6 binds to other members of the PIAS family, or to other classes of SUMO ligases has not been reported. Subsequently, work in our lab demonstrated that high risk E6 proteins can also bind to Ubc9, the SUMO conjugating enzyme (Heaton et al. 2011) . Unlike the situation for PIASy, E6 targets Ubc9 for proteasomal degradation via the ubiquitin ligase E6AP which results in a significant perturbation of the overall cellular sumoylation profile. While the consequences of this interaction for viral fitness have not yet been examined, the ability of E6 to dysregulate host sumoylation globally through attacks on PIASy and Ubc9 suggest that this will have important ramifications for the viral life cycle.

Sumoylation of E1B-55K also requires phosphorylation at a C-terminal motif (Wimmer et al. 2013) , a site which is likely modified by cellular protein kinase CK2 (Ching et al. 2012) . The phosphorylation site on E1B-55K protein is not part of the SUMO recognition motif so addition of the phosphate moiety is not creating a typical phosphorylation-dependent sumoylation motif (Hietakangas et al. 2006) . Instead, phosphorylation appears to be providing a cross-talk mechanism between phosphorylation and sumoylation by an as yet undefined mechanism.

Interestingly, adenovirus infection also led to reduced sumoylation of KAP1 itself, resulting in decreased epigenetic silencing, suggesting a complex interplay between E1B-55K and KAP1 that is at least in part involving the sumoylation system.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 198, "end": 218, "text": "(Wimmer et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF203"}, {"start": 269, "end": 288, "text": "(Endter et al. 2001", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 367, "end": 387, "text": "(Wimmer et al. 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF203"}, {"start": 453, "end": 472, "text": "(Ching et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 667, "end": 692, "text": "(Hietakangas et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}, {"start": 1010, "end": 1029, "text": "(Burck et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Adenoviruses"}, {"text": "Functionally, E1B-55K sumoylation is required for nuclear localization of E1B-55K (Kindsmuller et al. 2007 ). Sumoylation blocks a CRM-dependent nuclear export sequence (NES), thus helping retain E1B-55K in the nucleus. Subnuclear localization of E1B-55K is also regulated by the viral E4orf6 protein such that the intranuclear distribution of E1B-55K changes as E4orf6 levels increase during infection (Leppard and Everett 1999) . As E4orf6 levels increase there is a decrease in E1B-55K sumoylation, suggesting that E4orf6 may in part be regulating E1B-55K through controlling sumoylation levels (Lethbridge et al. 2003) . Importantly, nuclear retention and subnuclear localization of E1B-55k also relies on its interaction with the type IV and V isoforms of the PML protein, and the interaction with PML IV requires sumoylation of E1B-55K protein while the interaction with PML V is largely independent of sumoylation (Wimmer et al. 2010) . Surprisingly, sumoylation of E1B-55K was not required for its interaction with another PML associated protein, Daxx, but is required for the E1B-55K-mediated proteasomal degradation of Daxx (Schreiner et al. 2011; Wimmer et al. 2013) . A mutant of E1B-55K lacking the SUMO conjugation site was defective for Daxx degradation and for transformation of primary rodent cells, indicating that sumoylation of E1B-55K is important for its transforming activity (Schreiner et al. 2011 ).

While this study reported that E1B-55K SUMO ligase activity on p53 was not observed in vitro, a subsequent study was able to confirm E3 activity by E1B-55K protein in a reconstituted in vitro sumoylation reaction, thus confirming that E1B-55K itself has intrinsic ligase activity (Pennella et al. 2010) . The sumoylation of p53 by E1B-55K also requires that E1B-55K itself be sumoylated (Muller and Dobner 2008) . Since E1B-55K, in conjunction with E4orf6, mediates ubiquitinylation and proteasomal degradation of p53, this was the first example of a viral protein having dual activity in both the ubiquitin and SUMO pathways. Mutation of the p53 sumoylation site decreased the ability of E1B-55K to repress the transcriptional activity of p53 and to tether p53 in PML bodies (Pennella et al. 2010; Wimmer et al. 2016 ).

E4orf3 protein induces sumoylation of the host Mre11 and Nbs1 proteins in a process that requires relocalization of these proteins into E4orf3 nuclear tracks and does not require the E1B-55K SUMO ligase activity. The sumoylation of these two proteins is transient and peaks during early infection. Mre11 is modified by SUMO2 while Nbs1 is modified by either SUMO1 or SUMO2, though the functional significance of these paralog differences is not clear. Interestingly, the adenoviral induced sumoylation of these two proteins is only seen with subgroup C adenoviruses. Both the Mre11 and Nbs1 proteins are components of the MRN complex which functions in DNA damage repair and which must be inactivated by many viruses (Hollingworth and Grand 2015) , so presumably the sumoylation is helping subgroup C adenoviruses to defeat this defense process. E4orf 3 from type C adenoviruses also induces relocalization and sumoylation of TFII-I, a general transcription factor that can repress the adenoviral intermediate promoter L4P (Bridges et al. 2016 ). Sumoylation of TFII-I is followed by ubiquitinylation and degradation of TFII-I, leading to derepression of L4P, exemplifying how adenovirus can modulate viral transcription through the host sumoylation system. Furthermore, E4orf3 does not cause an overall increase in host sumoylation (Sohn et al. 2015) , so the effect on these three host proteins represents a specific and targeted role for E4orf3 protein. However, these are not the only targets for E4orf3 as a proteomic analysis found that E4orf3 expression influenced the sumoylation of 51 host proteins, most for them showing increased sumoylation (Sohn et al. 2015) . E4orf3 protein was subsequently found to specifically sequester the PIAS3 SUMO E3 ligase into its nuclear tracks while not affecting the localization of other PIAS family members, including PIAS1, PIAS2, and PIAS4 (Higginbotham and O'Shea 2015) . This result suggests that PIAS3 may be the primary E3 ligase through which E4orf3 protein mediates its effects on sumoylation of host proteins. The ability of E4orf3 protein to target PIAS3 was not restricted to the subclass type C adenoviruses, suggesting that E4orf3-induced effects on sumoylation will have a more general role in the adenoviral life cycle beyond the regulating the MRN and TFII-I proteins.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 129, "end": 152, "text": "(Sohn and Hearing 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF175"}, {"start": 872, "end": 901, "text": "(Hollingworth and Grand 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 1178, "end": 1198, "text": "(Bridges et al. 2016", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1488, "end": 1506, "text": "(Sohn et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF176"}, {"start": 1808, "end": 1826, "text": "(Sohn et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF176"}, {"start": 2043, "end": 2073, "text": "(Higginbotham and O'Shea 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF88"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Adenoviruses"}, {"text": "Another adenovirus protein that influences host sumoylation is the E1A protein (Ledl et al. 2005) . E1A is an early protein that regulates viral genome transcription and contributes to cell transformation (Berk 2005) . A major target for E1A is the host pRB protein, a regulatory factor that binds to E2FE2F and masks the E2F transcriptional activation of S phase genes (Dyson 2016 ). In addition, pRB can recruit repressive chromatin remodeling factors to E2F bound promoters to further silence gene expression (Berk 2005) . Ledl et al. showed that SUMO is attached to pRB at a single residue, lysine 720, in the B-box motif which interacts with LxCxE-motif proteins such as E1A (Ledl et al. 2005) . Mutation of lysine 720 results in a pRB protein with increased repressive activity on an E2Fresponsive promoter, indicating that sumoylation negatively regulates pRB repressive activity. E1A is known to bind pRB leading to the release and activation of E2F. However, binding of E1A to pRB also prevents sumoylation of lysine 720, thereby providing another level of control of pRB by this viral protein (Ledl et al. 2005) . Ultimately, E1A seeks to activate cellular S-phase and increase transcription of DNA replication related genes to promote viral genome reproduction, and influencing the sumoylation state of pRB may provide fine regulation of E2F activity. Furthermore, E1A binds to a variety of other cellular proteins (Berk 2005) , at least two of which are themselves sumoylated, CtBP (Lin et al. 2003 ) and p300 (Girdwood et al. 2003) . This raises the possibility that E1A might also decrease the sumoylation state of binding partners other than pRB if complex formation also blocks their sumoylation. Additionally, E1A also directly binds the SUMO conjugase, Ubc9 (Hateboer et al. 1996) . The binding element in E1A is located within conserved region 2 and is comprised of the sequence EVIDLT (Yousef et al. 2010 ). This E1A motif interacts with the N-terminal region of Ubc9, a region which also binds SUMO and is involved in polysumoylation (Knipscheer et al. 2007 ). While E1A binding to Ubc9 did not affect global sumoylation in cultured human cells, this interaction did interfere with polysumoylation in a yeast model, suggesting that subtle alterations in host polysumoylation could be occurring during viral infection (Yousef et al. 2010) . For example, Yousef et al. observed that E1A affected PML localization in an Ubc9-dependent manner, and PML is known to be polysumoylated (Tatham et al. 2001) , so perhaps E1A is disrupting PML polysumoylation through blocking this activity of Ubc9. Alternatively, since E1A does not block the monosumoylation activity of Ubc9 (Yousef et al. 2010 ), E1A could be enhancing the sumoylation of specific substrates by redirecting Ubc9 to PML bodies or other E1A targets.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 79, "end": 97, "text": "(Ledl et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 205, "end": 216, "text": "(Berk 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 370, "end": 381, "text": "(Dyson 2016", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 512, "end": 523, "text": "(Berk 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 526, "end": 537, "text": "Ledl et al.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 680, "end": 698, "text": "(Ledl et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 1103, "end": 1121, "text": "(Ledl et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 1426, "end": 1437, "text": "(Berk 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1494, "end": 1510, "text": "(Lin et al. 2003", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}, {"start": 1522, "end": 1544, "text": "(Girdwood et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 1776, "end": 1798, "text": "(Hateboer et al. 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 1905, "end": 1924, "text": "(Yousef et al. 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF216"}, {"start": 2055, "end": 2078, "text": "(Knipscheer et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 2338, "end": 2358, "text": "(Yousef et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF216"}, {"start": 2499, "end": 2519, "text": "(Tatham et al. 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF186"}, {"start": 2688, "end": 2707, "text": "(Yousef et al. 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF216"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Adenoviruses"}, {"text": "Clearly, a great deal of further investigation is required to sort out all the possible ramifications for sumoylation in the adenoviral life cycle.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Adenoviruses"}, {"text": "Lastly, while not a human virus, it is germane to mention the GAM1 protein of the avian type 1 adenovirus known as CELO (Chicken Embryo Lethal Orphan virus) (Chiocca et al. 1996) . GAM1 has the most dramatic inhibition of global sumoylation of all known viral proteins, and is well-characterized mechanistically. Moreover, a CELO Gam1 negative mutant is replicationdefective, which clearly establishes GAM1 as an important protein for the viral life cycle. Interestingly, this 30 kDa viral protein has no homology to other known anti-apoptotic proteins such as E1B from the adenovirus type 5 or to the Bcl2 and Bax family of eukaryotic proteins. GAM1 is predominantly located in the nucleus, and sumoylation is globally reduced when GAM1 is expressed in a dose dependent manner (Boggio et al. 2004; Colombo et al. 2002) . GAM1 was also shown to re-distribute SUMO from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, promoting nuclear transcription factor and HDAC (histone deacetylase) de-sumoylation, thus positively influencing cellular transcription. Mechanistically, it was established that GAM1 binds to the SUMO activation enzyme complex, SAE1/SAE2 (Boggio et al. 2004 ) and reduces the half-life of SAE1/ SAE2 by recruiting a cellular ubiquitin E3 ligase to the GAM1-SAE1/SAE2 complex that ubiquitinylates SAE1 leading to proteasomal degradation (Boggio et al. 2007 ). The loss of SAE1 destabilizes both SAE2 and Ubc9, resulting in reduction in their levels as well. Even though the de-sumoylation process is unaffected by GAM1, the inability to perform new SUMO modification greatly decrease the entire pool of sumoylated subtracts. The net result of this GAM1 effect is an increase in overall cellular transcriptional activity which facilitates viral replication. While GAM1 may be an extreme example, it is likely that other viruses have evolved related strategies to target the sumoylation enzymes in order to enhance the cellular transcriptional environment to favor their replication needs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 157, "end": 178, "text": "(Chiocca et al. 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 778, "end": 798, "text": "(Boggio et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 799, "end": 819, "text": "Colombo et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1138, "end": 1157, "text": "(Boggio et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1336, "end": 1355, "text": "(Boggio et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Adenoviruses"}, {"text": "The family Herpesviridae is a diverse group with three subfamilies (\u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3) that encompasses eight human viruses termed human herpesviruses (HHV) 1-8, though most have common names such as cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus (Grinde 2013) . A characteristic feature of this family is that all members can establish latent infections, either with or without an acute disease presentation, leading to very complex interactions with their respective host cells.

These forms were eventually determined to be SUMO-modified versions of PML, a major component of nuclear ND10 bodies (Muller and Dejean 1999) . Similarly, ICP0 also decreases the amount of sumoylated Sp100, another major constituent of ND10s (Everett et al. 1998) . ND10 disruption by HSV is necessary for effective lytic replication, and this disruption requires ICP0. Originally, this loss of sumoylated PML and Sp100 was believed to cause disruption of the ND10s, but subsequent studies showed that the SUMO protease, SENP1, could elicit similar loss of the sumoylated forms of PML and Sp100 without affecting ND10 structures (Bailey and O'Hare 2002) .

ICP0 also has SIM motifs that are required for its ability to overcome the anti-viral function of ND10s ). These SIM motifs help direct ICP0 to sumoylated proteins where it causes their ubiquitinylation and proteasomal degradation. While ICP0 causes a general decrease in cellular sumoylated proteins, sumoylated PML is preferentially degraded (Sloan et al. 2015) . One putative SIM in the central region of ICP0 was absolutely required for this general effect on sumoylated host proteins and for PML isoforms other than type 1, while several putative SIMs in the C-terminal region also contributed (Everett et al. 2014) .

The SIM motif in IE2-p86 was also necessary for interaction with the host sumoylated form of the TATA-binding protein (TBP), an interaction which enhanced IE2's transactivation ability . Given that many other transcription associated factors are known to be sumoylated, the potential for IE2-p86 to recruit numerous other host proteins through SIM-SUMO interaction is intriguing. Lastly, a recent study found that IE2 inhibited IE1 sumoylation (Kim et al. 2014 ). This negative regulation was found to be mediated through PIAS1 binding by IE2. PIAS1 stimulates sumoylation of IE1, so binding of PIAS1 by IE2 may sequester it and prevent PIAS1-mediated sumoylation of IE1. Consistent with this model, levels of IE1 sumoylation peaked early in infection and decreased in late phase where IE2 levels were highest.

EBV is the etiological agent of infectious mononucleosis and is also associated with several diverse cancers (Hislop 2015) . Sumoylation plays an important role in the life cycle of this virus with four viral proteins known to be sumoylated (BZLF1, Rta, EBNA3B, and EBNA3C), three viral proteins that modulate sumoylation (LF2, LMP, and BGLF4), several other viral proteins that have putative SIM motifs (Li et al. 2012a) , and one report suggesting that viral microRNAs may modulate the sumoylation system (Callegari et al. 2014 ). The first reported EBV protein identified as a SUMO substrate is the BZLF1 protein (also known as Z protein or ZTA), one of the EBV immediate early gene products (Adamson and Kenney 2001) . Two groups demonstrated that BZLF1 has a single SUMO acceptor lysine at position 12, and that BZLF1 can be modified by SUMOs 1-3 (Hagemeier et al. 2010; Murata et al. 2010) .

This effect on sumoylation of BZLF1 does not require phosphorylation of BZLF1 itself so the actual mechanism is unknown. Functionally, the consensus is that sumoylation represses that transactivation ability of BZLF1 (Adamson 2005; Hagemeier et al. 2010; Murata et al. 2010 ) as mutation of the SUMO acceptor site increases transactivation activity as does desumoylation of BZLF1 with exogenously expressed SENP. At least part of the repressive effect appears to be due to preferential interaction of cellular histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) with the sumoylated form of BZLF1 (Murata et al. 2010) . Similarly, the cellular scaffolding protein, RanBPM, was shown to enhance BZLF1 transactivation by binding BZLF1 and inhibiting its sumoylation (Yang et al. 2015b) .

Like BZLF1, Rta is sumoylated, though for this protein there are three sumoylation sites at lysines 19, 213, and 517 (Chang et al. 2004 ). Members of the PIAS family act as SUMO ligases for Rta as PIAS1 and PIASx (alpha and beta) interact with Rta and stimulate its sumoylation (Liu et al. 2006) . In contrast to BZLF1, it was initially reported that the transactivation activity of Rta is enhanced by sumoylation (Chang et al. 2004; Liu et al. 2006) . However, a later study demonstrated that sumoylation was not needed for transactivation (Calderwood et al. 2008) , so a functional role for Rta sumoylation in transactivation remains questionable. Interestingly, there is additional complex regulation of Rta function, some of which involves sumoylation. Two cellular proteins, RanBPM and RNF4, and one viral protein, LF2, have been shown to influence Rta and affect sumoylation. RanBPM, the nucleocytoplasmic scaffolding protein that inhibits BZLF1 sumoylation has the opposite effect on Rta as RanBPM binds Rta and enhances its sumoylation leading to increased activity on several promoters (Chang et al. 2008) . However, sumoylation of Rta promotes its association with a cellular STUbL known as RNF4 through the SIM motifs in RNF4 . Thus, Rta sumoylation may enhances its activity, but it also leads to its proteasomal degradation, perhaps providing a check and balance possibly to prevent excessive Rta activity. Rta activity is also negatively regulated by the viral LF2 protein (Calderwood et al. 2008) .

Paradoxically, these SUMO modifications are not required for the negative regulation by LF2 which is due to LF2 binding and relocalization of Rta to the extranuclear cytoskeleton.

Both EBNA3B and 3C are sumoylated with sumoylation being much more prominent for EBNA3C; EBNA3A was not seen to be sumoylated (Rosendorff et al. 2004) . Mutants of EBNA3C that could not be sumoylated were more diffusely distributed rather than accumulating in nuclear dots. Nonetheless, these mutants were still wild-type in their ability to transactivate the LMP1 promoter in conjunction with EBNA2, so this function does not appear to require sumoylation. Instead of covalent modification by SUMO, one or more SIM-like motifs in EBNA3C are important for LMP1 promoter activation (Lin et al. 2002; Rosendorff et al. 2004 ). EBNA3C interacts with p300/CBP at the LMP1 promoter, but a p300 mutant that was not sumoylated could still be co-activated by EBNA3C, so p300 is not the target for the EBNA3C SIM motif(s) (Rosendorff et al. 2004 ).

Both SIM motifs contribute to nuclear accumulation of BGLF4 by blocking nuclear export. SUMO binding by BGLF4 was also required for its ability to inhibit sumoylation of BZLF1, as was the kinase activity of BGLF4.

Subsequently, two specific cellular targets of LMP1-mediated sumoylation were identified, IRF7 (Bentz et al. 2012 ) and KAP1 (Bentz et al. 2015) . IRF7 is an interferon regulatory factor involved in innate immunity. LMP1 promotes sumoylation of IRF7 at lysine 452, resulting in decreased IRF7 function which likely helps abrogate the innate response during EBV latency (Bentz et al. 2012) . KAP1 (KRAB-associated protein 1) also is believed to have antiviral activity, likely through its transcriptional repressive activity (Iyengar and Farnham 2011) . KAP1 was shown to bind to EBV early promoters and the lytic origin of replication (OriLyt) in a sumoylation-dependent fashion (Bentz et al. 2015) . These results suggested that LMP1-mediated sumoylation of KAP1 helps to repress the lytic phase of EBV and promote maintenance of the latent state.

Four KSHV viral proteins, K-bZIP, K-Rta, LANA1 (ORF73), and LANA2 (vIRF3) modulate sumoylation of host and/or viral proteins. K-bZIP was the first KSHV protein identified as a SUMO substrate with modification occurring at lysine 158 (Izumiya et al. 2005) . Sumoylation of K-bZIP is negatively regulated by phosphorylation at threonine 111 catalyzed by the viral ORF36 protein kinase (Izumiya et al. 2007 ). However, it was later reported that K-bZIP splice variants exist, and that 2 of the variants lack the lysine 158 and are sumoylated on newly generated lysine, residue 207 (Lefort et al. 2010) . What, if any, different properties the variants have has not been extensively investigated. Functionally, K-bZIP is a transcriptional repressor, and sumoylation of K-bZIP enhances its repressive activity (Izumiya et al. 2005) . Additionally, K-bZIP binds Ubc9 and recruits it to viral promoters where it likely sumoylates and inactivates other transcription factors to facilitate repression. One pathway that has been characterized for K-bZIP is interferon-stimulated gene expression where K-bZIP represses target genes (Lefort et al. 2010) . A SUMO site mutant of K-bZIP is impaired for the ability to repress these target genes, indicating that sumoylation is a positive regulator for this activity of K-bZIP. Subsequently it was shown that K-bZIP is a viral SUMO E3 ligase that can catalyze its own sumoylation (Chang et al. 2010 ). K-bZIP contains a SIM motif the preferentially binds SUMO2/3 and not SUMO1, and its ligase function also utilizes primarily SUMO2/3. Using this ligase activity K-bZIP can sumoylate known binding partners such as p53 and pRB, and thus regulate their activities. More globally, during KSHV reactivation there is an increase of SUMO2/3 association with promoter regions of both cellular ) and viral genomes (Yang et al. 2015a) . For the cellular genome, the viral factor(s) responsible were not examined, but K-bZIP would be a likely candidate. Consistent with this speculation, K-bZIP was required for the increased SUMO2/3 association with viral DNA as a mutant lacking the SUMO ligase activity showed no increase (Yang et al. 2015a) . Importantly, the SUMO ligase defective mutant of K-bZIP showed increased virus production during infection, and the same results were seen with a SUMO2/3 knockdown. These results indicated that K-bZIP induced sumoylation is repressing viral activation and may function to help maintain the latent state. Similarly, enhanced SUMO2/3 modification at cellular promoters is likely to help prevent viral reactivation and/or to repress cellular innate immune responses to the virus.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 157, "end": 184, "text": "(Campbell and Izumiya 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 185, "end": 205, "text": "Chang and Kung 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 441, "end": 462, "text": "(Izumiya et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 591, "end": 611, "text": "(Izumiya et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 786, "end": 806, "text": "(Lefort et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}, {"start": 1013, "end": 1034, "text": "(Izumiya et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 1329, "end": 1349, "text": "(Lefort et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}, {"start": 1623, "end": 1641, "text": "(Chang et al. 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2049, "end": 2068, "text": "(Yang et al. 2015a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF213"}, {"start": 2358, "end": 2377, "text": "(Yang et al. 2015a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF213"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpes Virus"}, {"text": "While K-bZIP has SUMO E3 ligase activity that enhances sumoylation of viral and cellular proteins, the K-Rta protein is a STUbL that targets sumoylated proteins for proteasomal degradation (Izumiya et al. 2013 ).

Two HIV proteins, GAG (Jaber et al. 2009 ) and integrase interact with the sumoylation system. One of the GAG proteolytic products, p6, is sumoylated and this seems to be a negative regulatory event early in infection, perhaps as a host defense (Gurer et al. 2005) . Alternatively, later in infection the full-length GAG binds Ubc9, and reduction of Ubc9 by RNAi resulted in decreased incorporation of the ENV glycoprotein into released virions (Jaber et al. 2009 ). While not affecting total number of virions produced, the resulting virions were eight-to ten-fold less infectious. This effect did not require catalytically active Ubc9 so is unlikely to involve sumoylation of GAG. In contrast, integrase is sumoylated, but the functional consequence is unresolved as two groups have reported different effects. Zamborlini et al. reported that integrase has three SUMO consensus motifs and is multiply sumoylated . They found that a triple mutant at the three consensus sites had normal stability and intracellular localization, but was replication defective at a step after reverse transcription but before integration, suggesting that sumoylation was necessary for this undefined step. However, Li et al. subsequently reported that overexpression of sumoylation caused integrase to accumulated in nuclear punctate bodies rather than be diffuse (Li et al. 2012b) . They also observed that the degree of viral genome integration was inversely correlated with the levels of cellular sumoylation, leading to their suggestion that sumoylation is antiviral for HIV. While their studies did not directly confirm that these effects of sumoylation were mediated through integrase, it does raise questions about what sumoylation actually does for integrase activity. Interestingly, a recent report on a SENP inhibitor supports the antiviral nature of integrase sumoylation (Madu et al. 2015) . Treatment of HIV infected cells with this inhibitor reduces the infectivity of progeny virions as the virions had defective integration during subsequent infection. The inhibitor effect could be abrogated by mutation of the SUMO acceptor sites in integrase, implying that sumoylation of integrase is a negative regulator and that the only active integrase molecules are ones that have been desumoylated by SENPs prior to virion packaging.

A similar situation exists for Tax2 from the related HTLV-2B where Tax2 is sumoylated but the functional role of sumoylation is not clear (Journo et al. 2013; Turci et al. 2009 Turci et al. , 2012 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 339, "end": 360, "text": "(Lamsoul et al. 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 361, "end": 377, "text": "Nasr et al. 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF148"}, {"start": 415, "end": 435, "text": "(Bonnet et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 436, "end": 453, "text": "Pene et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF155"}, {"start": 726, "end": 746, "text": "(Journo et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 747, "end": 764, "text": "Turci et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF190"}, {"start": 765, "end": 784, "text": "Turci et al. , 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF191"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Retrovirus"}, {"text": "A second RNA virus with significant impact by the sumoylation system is the orthomyxovirus, influenza A virus (IAV).

The first identified IAV SUMO target was the NS1 protein (Pal et al. 2010) .

Without sumoylation of M1 and formation of this complex, viral maturation and assembly is greatly reduced which produces a strong reduction in viral yield. As cited above, NP is itself sumoylated with acceptor sites mapping to lysines 4 and 7; the lysine residue 7 is highly conserved and is critical for viral reproduction, so it may be the primary SUMO site (Han et al. 2014) . The sumoylation deficient mutant of NP exhibits altered intracellular localization which may prevent effective interaction with M1 and contribute to its functional defect in viral replication. Further regulation of this process is mediated by the viral NS2 protein (Gao et al. 2015) . NS2 interacts with the cellular AIMP2 protein, and the NS2-AIMP2 complex switches the modification of M1 lysine 242 from ubiquitin to SUMO which would facilitate the M1-NP interaction.

While sumoylation of rhabdoviral proteins has not yet been demonstrated, there is a recent report that sumoylation is involved in regulating both rabies and VSV infection . Stable exogenous SUMO expression blocked VSV viral mRNA synthesis, thus inhibiting all the downstream steps needed for viral reproduction. The host MxA protein is a known inhibitor of VSV transcription, and blocking MxA prevents the effect of increased SUMO expression. MxA protein becomes highly stable and accumulates under SUMO overexpression conditions, thus it appears that sumoylation is a host defense that restricts VSV by increasing the levels of this host protein that inhibits early steps in the VSV life cycle. In contrast to VSV, exogenous SUMO expression led to higher titers of rabies virus, an effect that was specific for SUMO3 and not SUMO1. It is known that MxA is not inhibitory for rabies virus, but SUMO3 expression did increase sumoylation of IRF3 which decreases its transcriptional activity and reduces the viral induction of interferon. Thus, for rabies virus increasing sumoylation has a positive effect on viral production, possibly through reduction of the interferon response.

Since overexpression of Ubc9 lead to reduced plaque formation, Ubc9 may be acting as part of the antiviral defense to restrict dengue infection at early stages. Conversely, silencing Ubc9 expression also reduced the replication of dengue, suggesting that the sumoylation system may have both positive and negative effects on dengue (Su et al. 2016) . In this case the effect was related to sumoylation of the viral NS5 protein. Sumoylation of NS5 was required for viral RNA replication and suppression of the interferon production. Sumoylation of NS2 required a SIM motif in NS2 and led to increased stability which could account for both the observed effects on replication and interferon.

Numerous viral proteins are substrates for sumoylation with example of both positive and negative regulation of their activities.

Additionally, there is an expanding list of viral proteins that can manipulate sumoylation, either a globally or in a substrate-specific manner. Given the wide range of cellular pathways affected by sumoylation, determining how these changes impact overall viral fitness require extensive experimentation, so in most reported cases the overall effect is still poorly understood.
