            "text": "Answer: C Candida is an increasingly common pathogen found due to line infections. It is currently the fourth leading bloodstream pathogen. In this particular case, despite the patient not appearing ill, treatment directed toward Candida should be initiated. The most common antifungal agents used for the treatment of candidemia are fl uconazole and the echinocandins. These include caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin. Amphotericin B is given less often due to the risk of nephrotoxicity. Both the echinocandins and the azoles are better tolerated than amphotericin B formulations. Candidemia requires treatment with antifungal agents. Catheter removal alone is not adequate therapy for candidemia. Several studies have noted the high mortality rates associated with candidemia. Furthermore, prompt initiation of therapy is crucial. 2. A 41-year-old male presented to the emergency room with shortness of breath and chest pain. Imaging reveals a pulmonary embolus. He is started on enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SQ BID and warfarin 5 mg PO daily. Nursing staff reports to perform enoxaparin teaching in preparation for his discharge the following day; however, he reports that he is terrifi ed of needles and feels as if twice daily injections will not be possible (weight = 77 kg, CrCl = 89 ml/min). Are there any other options to decrease the number of injections for this patient? A) Enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SQ daily B) Enoxaparin 0.5 mg/kg SQ daily C) Enoxaparin 1.5 mg/kg SQ daily D) Both A and C Answer: C Enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SQ daily would be used if a patient had a CrCl < 30 ml/min. Enoxaparin 0.5 mg/kg SQ is the indicated dose for infants >2 months and children </=18 years of age for thromboembolism prophylaxis and would be dosed BID, not daily. Enoxaparin 1.5 mg/kg SQ daily is an appropriate outpatient dosing regimen for patients with a CrCl > 30 ml/min for treatment.",

A) Oral prednisone 60 mg daily B) Intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g daily administration C) Methylprednisolone 125 mg Q 6 h D) Increase gabapentin dosage E) Plasmapheresis F) B and E Answer: F Intravenous methylprednisolone with a suggested dose of 1 g/day for 3-5 days has been the traditional treatment for acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis. This patient is experiencing an acute exacerbation or relapse of her underlying multiple sclerosis. The data supports the use of high-dose intravenous corticosteroids. This treatment regimen has been demonstrated to speed the recovery from a multiple sclerosis attacks; however, it is uncertain whether this impacts long-term disability. The 2011 American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Plasmapheresis Guideline Update states that plasmapheresis is effective and may be considered in fulminant demyelinating CNS disease as a fi rst-line agent. Plasmapheresis can also be considered in cases resistant to corticosteroid therapy, and clinical improvement should be followed closely. Previous clinical trials have demonstrated that oral prednisone is inferior to high-dose intravenous corticosteroids. A change in this patient's chronic disease-modifying therapy may be considered in consultation with a multiple sclerosis specialist, but would be of no benefi t in the acute multiple sclerosis fl air.",

On physical exam, you ask the patient to sit on the bedside with her head turned approximately 45\u00b0 to the right.

A) MRI of her cerebellum B) Methylprednisolone taper beginning at 60 mg daily C) Repositioning (Epley) maneuvers D) Rizatriptan 10 mg orally once E) Valacyclovir 1000 mg three times daily for 10 days Answer: C The symptoms and physical examination of this patient are typical of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Referral to ENT or physical therapy for repositioning maneuvers is the best treatment. BPPV is a common cause of vertigo. Episodes of BPPV are typically brief, lasting no more than 1 min. They are brought about by changes in position. Typical reported movements that elicit vertigo are lying down, rolling over in bed, rising from bed, sitting up and tilting the head to look upward. Vertigo is often accompanied by nystagmus that beats upward and torsionally toward the affected ear. This can be elicited by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver which was performed on physical exam. The history and physical examination are not consistent with a central cause of vertigo. An MRI can probably be avoided. Methylprednisolone is the primary treatment of acute vestibular neuritis. It is of benefi t if used within the fi rst 3 days of symptoms. Vestibular neuritis often presents with more prolonged and persistent symptoms. Most patients recover spontaneously, but when used early, methylprednisolone will decrease the duration of symptoms. Antiviral therapy is not indicated unless there is an obvious herpes zoster infection. Likewise, the symptoms are not consistent with migrainous vertigo, which would be persistent for hours and not be affected by positional changes.",

She has also been experiencing increasing weakness during the past week as well. She notes a worsening of her symptoms at the end of the day, and she has noticed weakness while brushing her hair. Occasionally she reports blurry vision or difficulty with reading. On physical exam, no specifi c weakness is noted. She seems fatigued in general and has a depressed affect. Pulmonary exam is normal. All labs are within normal range. Which of the following neuromuscular disorders is most likely the cause of this patient's symptoms? A) Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome B) Bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis C) Myasthenia gravis D) Duchenne muscular dystrophy E) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) Answer: C Multiple neuromuscular disorders may affect respiratory function. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome usually presents as an ascending paralysis with respiratory symptoms occurring later and rarely as a presenting symptom. Although bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis would explain this patient's shortness of breath, the proximal muscle weakness and ocular symptoms would remain unexplained. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked disorder that exclusively affects males that presents by 12 years of age. The majority of patients with ALS present clinically with progressive asymmetrical weakness, fasciculations, and prominent muscle atrophy. The distal musculature is primarily involved. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that interferes with the postsynaptic acetylcholine receptor. Patients usually present with intermittent symptoms that are usually worse at the end of the day. Respiratory symptoms may be the presenting symptom. The most common severe symptom of myasthenia gravis is respiratory failure. Exposure to bright sunlight, surgery, immunization, emotional stress, menstruation, infection and physical factors might trigger or worsen exacerbations.",

A) Lymphomatoid granulomatosis B) Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) C) Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) D) Churg-Strauss syndrome E) Goodpasture disease Answer: C This patient has granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), which was formerly known as Wegener's disease. It is associated with both distinctive and nonspecifi c mucocutaneous signs. Palpable purpura suggestive of vasculitis is one of the most common skin fi ndings. A variety of other dermatologic conditions have been reported including ulcers, papules, and nodules. In addition to upper and lower pulmonary symptoms, nasal ulcerations and septal perforation should suggest the diagnosis. Biopsy is required. Diagnosis is made by the demonstration of a necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis in a patient with upper and lower respiratory tract disease and glomerulonephritis. C-ANCA autoantibodies make several autoimmune diseases less likely. The absence of asthma makes the diagnosis of Churg-Strauss syndrome unlikely. Patients with lymphomatoid granulomatosis present with a predominance of pulmonary and nervous system manifestations, and tests for ANCA autoantibodies are usually negative.",

He underwent a thoracentesis that revealed an exudative effusion. With no resolution of the effusion, a repeat thoracentesis and chest tube was placed 2 days later.

A) Expand antibiotic coverage B) Repeat chest tube placement C) Change antibiotics and continue with chest tube drainage D) Perform video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) E) No change required at this time Answer: D Patients with pneumonia and exudative effusion resistant to drainage should be considered for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Approximately 15-40% of patients with exudative effusion require surgical drainage of the infected pleural space. Chest tubes often become clogged or effusions become loculated. Patients should be considered for surgery if they have ongoing signs of sepsis in association with a persistent pleural collection. VATS is used as a fi rst-line therapy in many hospitals if cardiothoracic surgery support is available. Open thoracic drainage remains a frequently used alternative technique.",

The most likely cause of patient's worsening mental status is: A) Worsening CO 2 retention B) Diminishing effects of naloxone C) Further narcotic use D) Sepsis E) Delirium secondary to pancreatitis Answer: B Naloxone has an extremely rapid onset of action. The duration of naloxone is no greater than 1-2 h. This is of importance as patients who have received a one-time dose may have a return of intoxication symptoms. All opiates have a longer duration of action than naloxone. All patients with opiate overdose symptoms both in the emergency room and on the fl oor should be monitored for a return of symptoms after naloxone has been given. Naloxone is most commonly injected intravenously for fastest action, which usually causes the drug to act within a minute.

            "text": "Answer: E This patient has an acute onset of Bell's palsy. The current treatment of choice is prednisone. Mounting evidence suggests that Bell's palsy is due to human herpes virus 1. It is often is seen after a viral prodrome. Physical examination reveals paralysis of both the upper and lower facial motor neurons which distinguishes it from a cerebrovascular accident. The patient may also report dry mouth, impaired taste, and pain and numbness in the ear. Abrupt onset of symptoms usually occurs over 1-2 days. The most appropriate treatment is oral prednisone 40 mg per day, started within the fi rst 72 h. Antiviral agents have been used in the past. There is no evidence to date that anti-herpes virus agents, such as acyclovir, as monotherapy for Bell's palsy are of benefi t. High-dose intravenous corticosteroids are not indicated for the treatment of Bell's palsy. 10. A 23-year-old female is brought to the emergency room by her roommate with the chief complaint of increasing agitation, which began this morning. All history is obtained from the roommate who reports that the patient has been out for the past two days and has been acting strange and paranoid since returning home. Nothing is known about what the patient may have ingested. On physical exam, she is diaphoretic, alert, and agitated. She exhibits some unusual behaviors, such as picking at her legs. Her temperature is 38.3 \u00b0C (101.0 \u00b0F), heart rate is 120 bpm, and respirations are 26 per minute. Her blood pressure is 165/100 mmHg. On physical exam, it is noted that she has poor dentition. A few pustules and scabs are noted on the face. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are normal. She is slightly hyperrefl exic. Laboratory examination reveals normal liver enzymes and a normal basic metabolic profi le.",

A) Cocaine B) Benocyclidine C) Methamphetamine (Crystal Meth) D) MDMA (ecstasy) E) LSD Answer: C Methamphetamine, which has multiple street names including crystal or crystal meth, presents with hypertension, tachycardia, hyperthermia, and often with poor dentition and evidence of skin excoriations. Other common symptoms are paranoia and diaphoresis. Methamphetamine ingestion is commonly seen in both urban and rural settings. Ingestions often occur at extended late night events, concerts, and within group settings. Methamphetamine users and addicts may lose their teeth abnormally quickly. This may be due to several factors that lead to dry mouth as well as specifi c behaviors that are induced by the drug. 5-15 % of users may fail to recover completely after cessation of drug use. Antipsychotic medications may effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis. 11.

            "text": "Answer: E Rivaroxaban may be a great choice for this patient due to his age and work lifestyle. It can be started without the need for bridging therapy. Coumadin monitoring can be problematic and leads to a great deal of noncompliance. If agreeable to the patient, warfarin plus enoxaparin is also an acceptable option. This dosing regimen is well established and validated. Current guidelines recommend that patients with upper extremity DVTs require treatment similar to lower extremity DVT. Option C is incorrect because of the lack of bridging required initially for this disease state. 12. A 38-year-old female patient with a history of end-stage renal disease on home peritoneal dialysis presents with a chief complaint of new onset abdominal pain. A peritoneal catheter was placed 6 months ago and since that time has had no complications. On physical exam, the abdomen is diffusely tender. She is afebrile. Serum WBC count is 15,000/\u03bcL. Initial therapy for treatment of suspected peritoneal dialysis-induced peritonitis would include which of the following? A) Ceftriaxone B) Vancomycin plus ceftriaxone C) Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and difl ucan D) Vancomycin E) Ceftriaxone and catheter removal Answer: B Peritonitis is a common complication seen in peritoneal dialysis patients. Unlike peritonitis seen in end-stage liver disease, the majority of infections are gram-positive bacteria. For this reason, vancomycin or other MRSAcovering antibiotic should be included in the initial therapy. Antifungal therapy should be initiated only if the gram stain reveals yeast. Catheter removal should be considered in certain circumstances but is not necessarily indicated with every infection. Indications for removal of catheter include a repeat infection after 4 weeks of antibiotic therapy, infection not responding to antibiotics, fungal peritonitis, or other resistant causes of peritonitis. 13. A 65-year-old man with a history of hepatitis C and progressive liver disease presents to the hospital with increasing low-grade fever, abdominal pain, and distension.

The chest pain of acute pericarditis is sudden and severe. It is constant over the anterior chest. In acute pericarditis, the pain worsens with inspiration and is reliably positional. The absence of a signifi cant effusion on echocardiography is not evidence against acute pericarditis. Salicylates or NSAIDs are the fi rst-line agents for treatment. Corticosteroids should be reserved for severe cases that are unresponsive to initial therapy. Symptoms may recur after steroid withdrawal, making their use problematic. Low-grade fever and sinus tachycardia may be present. If carefully auscultated, a pericardial friction rub can be detected in most patients when symptoms are acute. Electrocardiographic changes are common in infectious pericarditis and can occur with other etiologies as well. The characteristic change is an elevation in the ST segment in all leads. The absence of reciprocal ST segment depression distinguishes this characteristic pattern of acute pericarditis from acute myocardial infarction.

Avoidance of beta-blockers acutely after cocaine use is currently a part of the American Heart Association guidelines.

A low tidal volume mechanical ventilation strategy is now the standard of care for ARDS. Lung injury is presumed to arise from repetitive opening and closing of alveoli.

On examination her heart rate is 120 bpm, blood pressure is 87/58. The leg laceration looks clean with a wellgranulated base and no erythema, warmth, or pustular discharge. She does have diffuse erythema that is prominent on her palms, conjunctiva, and oral mucosa. There is some mild desquamation noted on her fi ngertips.",

This may include a combination of cephalosporins, vancomycin, or drugs effective against MRSA. The addition of clindamycin may reduce toxin production and mortality. Toxic shock usually has a prominent primary site of infection or source. Staphylococcal toxic shock can be associated with immunosuppression, surgical wounds, or retained tampons. Staphylococcus aureus colonization can incite toxic shock.

This patient's condition is almost certainly due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) due to her small cell lung cancer. Isotonic normal saline would probably worsen the hyponatremia by the mechanism of water retention and sodium excretion. When hypertonic saline is administered, careful monitoring of her sodium levels should be done to prevent central pontine myelinolysis, which can occur with rapid correction.

A) Acute or chronic idiopathic pancreatitis B) Gallstone pancreatitis C) Alcoholic pancreatitis D) Pancreatitis secondary to hypertriglyceridemia E) Malignancy-induced pancreatitis Answer: D This patient has triglyceride induced pancreatitis. The serum amylase level may be normal in some patients with acute pancreatitis associated with high triglycerides as marked elevations in the triglyceride level can interfere with the laboratory assay for amylase. The presence of a papular rash on this patient is consistent with eruptive xanthomas due to hypertriglyceridemia. In the acute phase, the initial treatment of hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis focuses on good hydration and analgesia and is similar to the management of acute pancreatitis due to any etiology. The triglyceride levels usually rapidly decrease within 48 h of the onset of acute pancreatitis. Gallstones and alcohol abuse combined account for 70-80 % of all cases of acute pancreatitis. Other etiologies include sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, strictures of the pancreatic duct, congenital anatomic abnormalities and genetic disorders, drugs, toxins, trauma, infections, and metabolic causes. Some cases are idiopathic. Metabolic causes of acute pancreatitis include not only hypertriglyceridemia but hypercalcemias well. Serum triglycerides generally need to be in excess of 1,000 mg/ dl to produce acute pancreatitis. This is most commonly seen in type V hyperlipoproteinemia and is usually associated with diabetes mellitus. Acute pancreatitis can itself raise triglyceride levels, but not to this degree. 33.

Legionella pneumonia presents with the common symptoms of fever, chills, and cough. Distinguishing features are loss of appetite, loss of coordination, and occasionally diarrhea and vomiting. Relative bradycardia has traditionally been considered a symptom. Laboratory tests may show signifi cant changes in renal functions, liver functions, and electrolytes. This can include marked hyponatremia. Chest X-rays often show bi-basal consolidation. It is diffi cult to distinguish Legionnaires' disease from other types of pneumonia by symptoms alone. Serology is often required for diagnosis. Many hospitals utilize the urinary antigen test for initial detection when legionella pneumonia is suspected. It is not spread from person to person, but rather often through exposure to aerosolized cool water, such is the case here. It acquired its name after a July 1976 outbreak of a then unrecognized disease, which affl icted 221 persons, resulting in 34 deaths.

A) Colonoscopy B) Esophagogastroduodenoscopy C) Increased intravenous access D) Placement of a nasogastric tube with lavage E) Technetium-labeled red blood cell scan Answer: C This patient is volume depleted and not hemodynamically stable. Survival may be dependent upon the correct management sequence. Two large-bore peripheral catheters or a central line for volume repletion is urgently required. Fluid resuscitation should be started as well as an urgent type and match for blood transfusion. Although rapid diagnosis may be of benefi t, early resuscitation measures should not be delayed by diagnostic workup. A nasogastric tube may be considered after volume resuscitation, if an upper source of gastrointestinal bleeding is likely. Regardless of the source of bleeding at this point in the management, the fi rst rule is to achieve hemodynamic stability. Although a colonoscopy is the diagnostic test of choice to evaluate for sources of lower gastrointestinal bleeding, this should not occur before volume resuscitation. A bleeding scan may be indicated if an endoscopic evaluation is not immediately possible or if an endoscopic evaluation has been non-revealing. Diverticular bleed is certainly a possibility in this case. If a bleeding diverticulum is detected on colonoscopy, it can be treated with thermal coagulation or epinephrine injection. Up to 90 % of diverticular bleeding resolves without intervention. On physical examination, the temperature is 39.0 \u00b0C (102.2 \u00b0F). Blood pressure is 120/75 mmHg.

Febrile neutropenia is a medical emergency. Patients may not present with overt signs of infection. However, septic shock and death can occur within hours of presentation. Initial antibiotic choices may include a third-generation cephalosporin, penicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitor, or cefepime. Endogenous fl ora from the gastrointestinal tract is the probable cause for most cases of febrile neutropenia. Vancomycin may be considered but alone would not be suffi cient coverage for this patient. Empiric antifungal therapy is usually reserved for patients who are febrile after the source of infection is not found following 4-7 days of broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. Viral infections are not common, and empiric therapy with antiviral agents such as acyclovir is not warranted. 40.

            "text": "Answer: E The current guidelines recommend that adults older than age 40 who are hospitalized for medical reasons and are expected to be less mobile for 3 days or more be given some form of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. This is based on several randomized controlled trials. However, whether these recommendations should apply to older adults is less uncertain. A systematic review and meta-analysis examined the evidence for harm and efficacy of pharmacologic prophylaxis of DVT in older adults. For the most part older adults with comorbidities have been excluded from studies. The majority of events prevented in studies are asymptomatic DVTs. There is no consistent reduction in fatal pulmonary embolism or mortality. When data from the three trials with patients older than age 75 are pooled, a similar reduction in endpoints to other trials is seen. However, two-thirds of these events are asymptomatic DVTs. In the general population, the absolute bleeding risk is generally increased by 2 % in the heparin treatment group. Older age with its comorbidities may increase this risk. The current data suggest that this patient would gain a very small absolute risk reduction for symptomatic DVTs and an even smaller risk for pulmonary embolism. Given her wishes, it is reasonable to stop heparin and encourage ambulation. In methadone patients, an ECG should be obtained on admission. QT prolongation may predict subsequent malignant arrhythmias and possible need to alter methadone treatment. Methadone has been used to treat heroin addicts for nearly 50 years, but little is known about its long-term side effects.",

Medications on admission are lisinopril, metoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and aspirin. On admission, Zosyn and vancomycin were initiated. She underwent a CT angiogram to rule out pulmonary embolism. She is now afebrile. Her blood pressure is 110/55 mmHg. She has no evidence of orthostasis. Since admission, her respiratory status has improved and her creatinine level has increased from a baseline of 1.5-3.2 mg/dL. Laboratory studies reveal a urine sodium of 44 mEq. Her fractional excretion of sodium is 2 %, and her fractional excretion of urea is 50 %. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's acute renal injury? A) Cholesterol emboli B) Acute interstitial nephritis C) Prerenal azotemia D) Normotensive ischemic acute kidney injury E) Contrast dye-induced kidney injury Answer: D This patient has normotensive ischemic kidney injury. The fi ndings of elevated fractional excretion of sodium, fractional excretion of urea, and granular casts seen on urinalysis are all consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's medical history reveals evidence of an underlying chronic kidney disease possibly due to vascular disease. This places the patient at increased risk for normotensive ischemic injury. The patient's lower blood pressure during hospitalization may be the result of a variety of factors, including infection, better medicine compliance, and the low-salt diet typically seen during a hospitalization. Acute interstitial nephritis, which is often caused by a hypersensitive reaction to medication, is a possibility. However, the patient's lack of fever, rash, and leukocytes on her urinalysis argues against this diagnosis. Prerenal azotemia is common in the consideration of this patient's differential diagnosis. The patient's fractional excretion of sodium of 2 % and fractional excretion of urea of 50 % argues against this. The fractional excretion of urea is a more sensitive test for patients on diuretics.

Aggressive fl uid resuscitation is indicated. Resolution of lactic acidosis within 6 h will have a benefi cial effect on this patient's survival. Resuscitation of the circulation should target a central venous oxygen saturation or mixed venous oxygen saturation of at least 70 %.

This patient is not at the maximum diuretic dose. Diuretics can be increased every 3-5 days, while maintaining the 40:100 mg ratio. In ascites due to end-stage liver disease, the maximum dose for furosemide is 160 mg daily and for spironolactone it is 400 mg daily. At the higher doses, decreasing effi cacy will be seen. As the total diuretic dose is increased, it can be given once daily or divided as twice daily dosing. Serum electrolytes and renal function tests should be carefully monitored as dose adjustments are made. The patient should discontinue diuretic therapy if the serum sodium decreases to less than 120 mmol/L, uncontrolled or recurrent encephalopathy develops, or the serum creatinine exceeds 2.0 mg/dL.

A) Nighttime use of melatonin B) Mobilizing patient to the chair early C) Prophylactic use of rivastigmine D) Maintaining lights on for visual stimulation Answer: B Delirium is a common problem in the hospitalized patient, especially with a history of underlying dementia or psychiatric disease. So far, only simple interventions focused on maintaining normal environmental issues have been proven to be of any benefi t. These include promoting sleep by decreasing nighttime stimuli, use of hearing aids and eyeglasses, and minimizing restraints. One study showed a reduction of sound during the night by using earplugs in patients in the ICU setting resulted in a decreased risk of delirium by 53 %. Family can play a role in decreasing delirium. They can assist in orienting and reassuring the patient. Support from a familiar nurse and staff should also be encouraged. There are no defi nitive studies that demonstrate the use of any prophylactic medicines, such as haloperidol or risperidone, provides any benefi t. The use of these and other sedatives should be minimized. Pain can contribute to delirium as well as the excessive use of narcotics. Rivastigmine has been shown to worsen delirium in the hospitalized patient. Melatonin has had no clear clinical benefi t in reduction of delirium. Early physical and occupational therapy may also be of some benefi t.",

It can cause aplastic crises in persons with hemolytic disorders, chronic anemia in immunocompromised hosts, and fetal loss in pregnant women. The rash of erythema infectiosum usually appears without prodromal symptoms after an incubation period of 4-14 days. The rash starts as a fi ery-red rash on both cheeks. It then extends as an erythematous maculopapular eruption on the proximal extremities and trunk in a reticular pattern. The rash may wax and wane for several weeks. Arthralgia and arthritis are seen in up to 80 % of infected adults. Parvovirus B19 can cause an aplastic crises in patients who have sickle cell anemia, hereditary spherocytosis, thalassemia, and various other hemolytic anemias. These aplastic crises are abrupt in onset and are associated with giant pronormoblasts in the bone marrow. They generally resolve spontaneously after 1 or 2 weeks. In immunocompromised patients, acute infection may lead to viral per-sistence and chronic bone marrow suppression. In this patient, the anemia with a low reticulocyte count suggests a transient aplastic process and not a hemolytic crisis. ",

It is generally seen in combination with other signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, such as delirium, tremor, tachycardia, and diaphoresis. Benign rolandic epilepsy is a syndrome seen in younger children who have seizures, usually during sleep. Temporal lobe epilepsy is the most common of the localizationrelated epilepsies. This often is due to a specifi c brain malformation, such as trauma, infarct, or congenital. The most common seizure occurring with temporal lobe epi-lepsy is complex partial seizure. Patients with complex partial seizures are awake but exhibit altered awareness, such as unresponsiveness or staring. 78. A 38-year-old female is admitted to the hospital for a 2-day history of fever and abdominal pain. Her medical history is notable for cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis C, esophageal varices, and ascites. Her medications are furosemide, spironolactone, nadolol, and lactulose. On physical examination, the temperature is 36.5 \u00b0C (97.7 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 110/60 mmHg, pulse rate is 90/min, and respiration rate is 20/min. Abdominal examination discloses distention. The abdomen is mildly tender upon palpation.",

The diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is made in the setting of an elevated ascitic fl uid absolute polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell count of greater than 250/\u03bcl without evidence of secondary causes of peritonitis. A positive bacterial culture of the ascitic fl uid is not needed. Intravenous cefotaxime or a similar third-generation cephalosporin is the treatment of choice for SBP. However per Cochrane review, this class has not been shown to be superior to other classes of antibiotics. Most common isolates are Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and pneumococci. Vancomycin is not needed for initial treatment. Oral fl uoroquinolone treatment may be indicated in mild cases treated as an outpatient. Several strategies may be employed to improve renal vascular fl ow in the setting of SBP. Intravenous albumin is the most widely used. The use of cefotaxime plus intravenous albumin at 1.5 g/kg on day 3 has been shown to decrease in-hospital mortality by 20 % in patients with serum creatinine values of 1.5 mg/dL or greater.

According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the recommended goal A1C for this patient is less than 7 %. Metformin as monotherapy, if not contraindicated, may be fi rst-line therapy. However, in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetics with marked symptoms and/or highly elevated blood glucose or A1C, insulin therapy is indicated. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology has more specifi c guidelines with respect to initiating therapy. Specifi cally, when the entry level A1C is greater than 9 % and/or the patient is symptomatic (urinalysis 2+ glucose, polydipsia, polyuria), insulin plus or minus other agents is recommended. Monotherapy is recommended when the entry A1C is less than 7.5 %. Similarly, dual therapy is recommended when the entry level A1C is greater than or equal to 7.5 %, but less than 9 %. Additionally, the oral agents will drop the A1C by approximately 1-2 % (not all oral agents); therefore, this would not be an adequate decrease for a patient with an A1C of 9 % or greater. ",

This patient is a nonresponder as determined by Lille score and there is little clinical benefi t for continuing prednisolone. Her prognosis is poor given that she is a nonresponder to corticosteroids and it is reasonable to involve palliative care. Switching to pentoxifylline has been evaluated in a prospective randomized trial and has no proven clinical benefi t. The overall 30-day mortality rate in patients hospitalized with alcoholic hepatitis is approximately 15 %. In patients with severe chronic liver disease, the rate approaches or exceeds 50 %. Liver transplantation would not be an option in the United States for fulminant alcoholic hepatitis given his recent alcohol use. A consultation with the liver transplant service may be needed to review and communicate these issues.

Rapid development of jaundice and ascites often occur. Sixty percent of patients with this syndrome have or eventually will be diagnosed with a myeloproliferative disorder. Polycythemia vera and essential thrombocytosis are the two most common underlying disorders. The JAK2 V617F gene mutation is present in 97 % of patients with polycythemia vera and in 50 % of those with essential thrombocythemia. It should be measured in all patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome. Positive fi ndings indicate a myeloproliferative disorder and suggest the need for cytoreductive therapy. There are several options in the treatment of Budd-Chiari including anticoagulation, thrombolytics, and surgery. Consultation with hepatology for the management, guidance, and possible need for transplantation should be fi rst undertaken. In addition, consultation with interventional radiologists, hematologists, oncologists, gastroenterologists, and general surgeons may be required to coordinate the most effective approach.

Symptom-triggered therapy as opposed to fi xed dose is appropriate. The most objective and best-validated tool to assess the severity of alcohol withdrawal is the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, Revised (CIWA-Ar). This survey consists of ten items and can be administered rapidly by trained personnel at the bedside in about 5 min. Therapy is based upon the score. The CIWA-Ar scale has its limitations and is not universally used. It has not been validated in complex medical patients, postsurgical patients, and critically ill patients. Fixed dose therapy can be instituted if symptoms are not controlled, erratic, or escalate despite symptom-based therapy. Haloperidol is not recommended in alcohol withdrawal in the absence of hallucinations. It may be used in psychosis or agitation nonresponsive to benzodiazepines. 99.

A) Increase meal-time insulin B) Increase basal insulin C) Increase both meal-time and basal insulin D) No change Answer: A Glucocorticoid use is associated with the risk of hyperglycemia. Effects are greater in the fed rather than fasting state. Insulin regimens need to take into account that glucocorticoids typically have greater effects on postprandial glucose levels rather than on fasting levels. Thus, the patient's initiation of prednisone is likely the culprit of those increased accu-check readings. B is incorrect because the target blood glucose goal in the non-critical patient in the hospital is typically 100-140 mg/dl and 140-180 mg/dl in critically ill patients. Thus, the fasting level of 130 mg/dl is appropriate and does not require dose adjustment. C is incorrect as referenced above -no basal adjustments are needed. Lastly, D is incorrect because a change is required for the meal-time dosing regimen as the values range from 220 to 251 mg/dl. 100.

A) Hemolytic uremic syndrome B) Acute tubular necrosis C) Post-infectious glomerulonephritis D) Scleroderma renal crisis E) Sepsis Answer: A This patient has hemolytic uremic syndrome. It was probably caused by Escherichia coli , in particular the O157: H7 strain. This strain produces a Shigella -like toxin that is effective against small blood vessels, like those found in the digestive tract and kidneys. In developing countries, infections usually develop after ingesting contaminated food or water. In developed countries sporadic outbreaks have occurred, often associated with food vendors. This patient has the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, schistocytes, and thrombocytopenia. Patients with acute tubular necrosis are more likely to present with muddy brown casts. Post-infectious glomerulonephritis commonly occurs after Streptococcal and Staphylococcal infections. Scleroderma renal crisis is characterized by an acute onset of hypertension, kidney failure, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Scleroderma renal crisis is not associated with bloody diarrhea.

She is hemodynamically stable but requires semi-urgent conversion to normal sinus rhythm. Considerations would include betablockers, but as she is currently experiencing a moderate degree of reactive airway disease. Beta-blockers may not be the best option. Adenosine may be useful for diagnosing and treating supraventricular tachycardia. It can treat atrioventricular node-dependent tachycardias such as atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia. It is not useful in the treatment of atrial fi brillation. Urgent electrocardioversion may be considered if needed urgently, but this must be weighed against the risk of a thrombotic event occurring in a patient who is not anticoagulated. Diltiazem could be considered; however, this may lower her blood pressure. Adenosine may control her rate or reveal atrial fi brillation and is an appropriate choice in this situation.

The clues to CJD in this patient are the relatively normal head imaging, the unexplained rapid onset of dementia, and the eventual appearance of myoclonus. Initially, individuals experience problems with muscular coordination; personality changes, including impaired memory, judgment, and thinking; and impaired vision. EEG, which may initially be normal, but often demonstrates a typical triphasic spike pattern. Criteria have been developed to confi rm the diagnoses. A confi rmatory protein can be measured in cerebrospinal fl uid. CJD remains a diagnostic challenge with an average of seven months passing before initial symptoms and confi rmation of a diagnosis. Imaging studies are emerging as valuable tools in diagnosing CJD, with evidence that diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences are more useful than electroencephalography. Paraneoplastic syndromes which can cause a rapid diffuse encephalopathy can present in a similar picture. A focused workup for malignancy would be warranted in this case as well.

Patients with heart failure and myocardial infarction are at an increased risk of developing atrial fi brillation. Amiodarone has \u03b2-blocking properties that can help with rate control.

Rebleeding rates were similar in the IV-PPI and oral-PPI groups at 72 h 7 days and 30 days. Octreotide is benefi cial in acute variceal bleeding and may have a role in severe peptic ulcer disease when endoscopy is deferred or not available. H2-receptor antagonists are inferior to proton-pump inhibitors in the management of acute gastrointestinal bleeds. CMV typically presents with distal esophageal ulceration. HSV infection presents with multiple vesiculation and ulcerations. The lesions are round, multiple, well circumscribed, uniform, and smaller than those in CMV disease. CMV is the most common cause of intraocular infection in patients with AIDS and should be considered with any visual complaint. This disease represents a reactivation of latent CMV infection. Before the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), CMV was the most common opportunistic infection in AIDS patients with a CD4+ cell count below 50/mL. 142. A 28-year-old female presents to the emergency room with a chief complaint of new-onset bruises to her thighs and some mild bleeding of her gums.

On physical exam, she appears well except for the reported bruises on her lower legs and arms. Some petechial is noted in her gums. Laboratory studies revealed a hemoglobin of 13, a leukocyte count of 6,500/\u03bcL, and a platelet count of 14,000/\u03bcL. A peripheral blood smear is normal. Rapid HIV screening is normal.",

Anemia or neutropenia may indicate other diseases. ITP has no cure, and relapses may occur years after successful initial medical or surgical management. The most frequent cause of death in association with ITP is spontaneous or accidental trauma-induced intracranial bleeding. Most adult cases are diagnosed in women aged 30-40 years, although it may be seen in a wide age distribution in adults. Onset in a patient older than 60 years is uncommon, and a search for other causes of thrombocytopenia is warranted. The primary treatment for this is oral prednisone and it is usually responsive. Platelet transfusion is reserved for incidences of life- 143. A 56-year-old woman is admitted with worsening confusion. She has a history of hepatitis C virus infection. She currently takes phenytoin 100 mg TID for seizure disorder. She has been on the same dose for many years. Lactulose 30 g TID and spironolactone 25 mg daily are taken for her liver disease. On physical examination, her blood pressure is 110/65 mmHg, heart rate is 87 beats/min, respiratory rate is 22 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation is 97 % on room air. She is afebrile. She is minimally responsive to voice and follows no commands. Her abdomen is distended with a positive fl uid wave but without tenderness. She does not appear to have asterixis. She has a horizontal nystagmus on examination. The white blood cell count is 12,000/\u03bcL with a normal differential. Her liver function tests are unchanged from baseline with the exception of an albumin that is now 2.1 g/dL compared with three months ago when her level was 2.9 g/dL. The ammonia level is 15 \u03bcmol/L, and her phenytoin level is 17 mg/L. A paracentesis shows a white blood cell count of 90/\u03bcL. What test would be most likely to demonstrate the cause of the patient's change in mental status? A) CT scan of the head B) Free phenytoin level C) Electroencephalogram (EEG)) D) Gram stain of ascites fl uid E) Gram stain of cerebrospinal fl uid (CSF) Answer: B This patient has phenytoin toxicity due to her chronic liver disease. Signs and symptoms of phenytoin toxicity include slurred speech, horizontal nystagmus, and altered mental status that can progress to obtundation and coma. Worsening hypoalbuminemia can lead to increased free levels of drugs that are more highly protein bound. This can lead to drug toxicity at total drug levels that are not typically considered toxic. Medications that are bound to plasma proteins include phenytoin, warfarin, valproic acid, and amiodarone. Although phenytoin is not contraindicated in those with mild liver disease, it should be discontinued in individuals with evidence of cirrhosis. 144. A 55-year-old female not on any medication presents with a 3-month history of worsening rash, fever to 38.2 \u00b0C (100.8 \u00b0F), weight loss, and worsening loss of sensation in her feet. On physical examination, you note tender palpable purpura of the bilateral lower leg. In addition, tract marks on the arms are present. Her laboratories indicate a Hg of 9.5 g/L and a creatinine of 2.5 mg/ dL. Gross proteinuria is noted on urinalysis. Baseline creatinine is 1.2 mg/dL from 6 months ago.",

Symptoms are consistent with nephrotic syndrome and polyarteritis nodosa (PAN); both of which occur in hepatitis B-induced vasculitis. HBV-associated vasculitis almost always takes the form of PAN. Dermatologic symptoms are very common in PAN. Skin involvement, which can be painful, occurs most frequently on the legs. While lupus may be a possibility, antihistone antibody is most commonly associated with drug-induced lupus and this patient is no medications. In addition, drug-induced lupus is less likely to cause renal disease. The presence of injection marks or history of intravenous drugs makes the acquisition of hepatitis B more likely.

A) Recommend not having surgery and continue to monitor clinically B) Recommend in patient cholecystectomy C) Recommend surgery in four weeks D) HIDA scan Answer: A Prophylactic cholecystectomy is not indicated for this patient. Observation is the appropriate management. The consensus is that with a few exceptions asymptomatic gallstones should be followed. Most patients with asymptomatic gallstones will never develop symptoms. There are instances where prophylactic cholecystectomy should be considered. These are when a patient is immunocompromised, awaiting organ transplantation, sickle cell disease, calculi greater than 3 cm in diameter, or when gallbladder cancer is likely. Cholecystectomy can be considered when other biliary tract abnormalities are present. In the past patients with diabetes mellitus were thought to be at higher risk, and prophylactic cholecystectomy was often recommended. Studies have shown that prophylactic cholecystectomy is of no clear benefi t and should not be routinely recommended for diabetics. Patients with no other risk factors but who are going to be living or traveling for a long period of time in a location that is far from basic medical care such as missionary work, scientifi c expeditions, or space travel may be advised to have cholecystectomy prophylactically.

Initial treatment includes respiratory and circulatory support. The fi rst 6 h of resuscitation of a critically ill patient with sepsis or septic shock are the most critical. Resuscitation of the circulation should target a central venous oxygen saturation or mixed venous oxygen saturation of at least 70 %. This often requires of 5 to 6 L of fl uid.

The syndrome occurs when there is an abnormal increase in abdominal pressure resulting in new organ dysfunction. This occurs when abdominal pressure is greater than 12 mmHg. Patients often have an abdomen clearly out of proportion to their body habitus. The exact pathophysiol-ogy of acute compartment syndrome is uncertain. Other risk factors for the acute compartment syndrome include aggressive fl uid resuscitation, which can occur with surgery. Measurement of intravesicular pressure through a bladder catheter is a common method for assessing intraabdominal pressure. However, this may not correlate directly with measured intra-abdominal pressure. Surgical depression through various methods of the abdomen is the defi nitive treatment. Temporizing measures include removing any constricting garments and not placing anything on the patient's abdomen. Aggressive fl uid resuscitation should be avoided.

A) Cerebral angiography B) MRI of the head C) Referral for temporal artery biopsy D) Prednisone therapy Answer: D This patient has giant cell arteritis (GCA). The onset of GCA may be either abrupt or insidious. GCA may begin with constitutional manifestations such as anorexia, fever, myalgia, night sweats, and weight loss. These symptoms may occur for a few days or weeks. Patients suspected of GCA should undergo immediate treatment with prednisone therapy, followed by temporal artery biopsy.

Further diagnostic workup should not delay the initiation of steroid therapy.

Available data suggests that when the biopsy is performed within four weeks of initiating corticosteroid therapy, the results will be unaffected. Few studies exist regarding the effi cacy of different dosing protocols for corticosteroids in GCA. Several dosing regimens are recommended depending on the severity of symptoms. 160.

Ventriculoperitoneal shunt infections can be diffi cult to diagnose owing to the mild and variable clinical presentation. Symptoms may refl ect increased intracranial pressure and may be subtle, such as lethargy, nausea, and headache. Classic meningeal symptoms may be absent, and fever may or may not be present. Patterns may be consistent with previous infections. The recent placement of a shunt warrants antibiotic coverage for a possible infection. The most likely causative micro-organisms of a shunt infection are coagulase-negative staphylococci S. aureus , diphtheroids including Propionibacterium acnes , and gram-negative bacilli such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Empiric therapy with vancomycin to cover staphylococci and diphtheroids and ceftazidime, cefepime, or meropenem to treat the gram-negative bacilli is appropriate pending CSF tap results. A shunt tap should only be considered after imaging of the brain and a shunt series is performed.

Although a number of chemical tests have been proposed to differentiate pleural fl uid transudates from exudates, the tests fi rst proposed by Light have become the standard. Common causes of exudative pleural effusions include parapneumonic effusions from typical bacterial infections, tuberculosis, connective tissue diseases, malignancy, and pancreatitis. A high pleural amylase level (>200) may indicate pancreatitis or esophageal rupture. The criteria from Light identify nearly all exudates correctly, but they misclassify approximately 20-25 % of transudates as exudates. This usually occurs in patients on longterm diuretic therapy for congestive heart failure. This tends to concentrate the protein and LDH levels within the pleural space. 172. A 57-year-old male with a known 35-year history of alcohol abuse presents with jaundice, ascites, and a left shoulder fracture following a bar room brawl last night.

A) Acetaminophen 325 mg every 6 h B) Hydrocodone 5 mg every 6 h C) Hydromorphone 0.5 mg iv every 6 h D) NSAIDS Answer: D Analgesia in cirrhotic patients can be challenging. Few prospective studies have offered an evidence-based approach. End-stage liver disease patients have important issues that make analgesia potentially risky. These include hepatic impairments in drug metabolism, chronic mental status changes, and renal dysfunction. Most agents can be used with caution. Acetaminophen is the most common cause of fulminant hepatic failure in the United States. Despite this, it can be used with caution. NSAIDS may be contraindicated in cirrhotic patients because of decreased renal blood fl ow and ensuing hepatorenal syndrome. If possible they should be avoided. The approach to analgesia in the cirrhotic population should be cautious but practical. Frequent monitoring is needed, including mental status, hepatic function, and renal function. 173.

The clinical picture is most consistent with alcohol withdrawal. Alcohol withdrawal is common and despite minimal reported use in this patient, it is the most likely diagnosis. Further discussion with a second source may reveal his actual alcohol use. Although commonly ordered, brain imaging is often not helpful in the evaluation of delirium. Patients vastly underestimate and report the actual amount of alcohol consumed. Overall underestimation may be on average as high as 75 %. It has been suggested that asking if alcohol has been ingested in the past 24 h is a better, nonthreatening screening question to identify heavy drinkers. 174.

A) Malaria B) Entamoeba histolytica C) Echinococcus D) Leishmaniasis Answer: B Amebic liver abscess is the most common extraintestinal manifestation of infection with Entamoeba histolytica . Untreated, it is associated with signifi cant morbidity and mortality. It has a worldwide distribution, but amebiasis is more prevalent in tropical areas. E. histolytica is transmitted via the fecal-oral route. It is generally acquired by the ingestion of contaminated food and water containing the infective cysts. The incubation period for E. histolytica infection is commonly 2-4 weeks but may range from a few days to years. Most patients with amebic liver abscess present within 2-4 weeks of infection and almost all within 5 months. Some cases may present years after travel to endemic areas. The mainstay of therapy is metronidazole, which is usually effective in eliminating the intestinal and extraintestinal amoeba. Amebic liver abscess of up to 10 cm can be cured with metronidazole without drainage. Indications for percutaneous drainage include large liver abscess, abscesses in the left hepatic lobe at risk for rupturing into the pericardium, and treatment failure.

Bites can cause pain within the fi rst few hours. Physical fi ndings are a ring of pallor surrounded by erythema. This  patient  has gallstone-induced pancreatitis. Ultrasonography of the abdomen is the most useful initial test in determining the etiology of pancreatitis. It is more sensitive than CT for the diagnosis of gallstone disease. CT is better at demonstrating morphologic changes in the pancreas caused by infl ammation. It is generally indicated in those with severe pancreatitis. Findings on plain fi lm are of little benefi t. ERCP can be useful in the management of pancreatitis but has no role in diagnoses. His age and elevated total bilirubin make alcohol a less likely cause. The median age at onset depends on the etiology. For alcohol, it is 39 and for biliary tract disease it is 69. 182. A 75-year-old male presents with bright red blood per rectum.

The most likely diagnosis is: A) Diverticula B) Arterial venous malformations C) Malignancy D) Hemorrhoids Answer: B Arterial venous malformations (AVM) are a common cause of lower intestinal bleeding. Over half are located in the right colon, and approximately 50 % of patients experience painless hematochezia. Colonic lesions most often bleed chronically and slow. However, as many as 15 % of patients present with acute massive hemorrhage. AVMs can be acute, chronic, and intermittent in nature. Angiography is considered the gold standard in diagnosing arterial venous malformations. Management of AVMs is often diffi cult. Electrocautery has been used to obliterate angiodysplasias. However, bleeding recurs in approximately 50 % of subjects. A reduction in the posttherapy transfusion requirements in patients' cauterized was not reported to be statistically superior to no therapy.",

The clues to CJD in this patient are the appearance of relatively normal imaging, the unexplained rapidly progressive dementia, and the subsequent appearance of myoclonus. Initially, individuals experience problems with muscular coordination and personality changes, including impaired memory suggestive of typical dementia.

Severe abdominal or back pain with syncope, followed by vague discomfort, is typical. Patients at greatest risk for abdominal aortic aneurysms are those who are older than 65 years and have peripheral atherosclerotic vascular disease.

This limitation results from both anatomic and dynamic obstruction of the airways. As a consequence, these patients require prolonged expiratory times to reach static lung volumes. Minimizing hyperinfl ation and avoiding excessive airway pressures are key goals in ventilating the patient with asthma. These goals are best accomplished by selective hypoventilation.

You are called to see a 24-year-old patient on the fl oor which has become markedly obtunded. He was recently admitted two hours ago for possible suicide attempt by ingestion of an unknown substance. His respiratory status was good on admission but he is having diffi culty handling secretions and a decision is made to intubate him urgently. Chest radiograph on admission was normal. Initial tidal volumes (TV) on the ventilator should be set to what setting? A) 4 ml/kg B) 6 ml/kg C) 10 ml/kg D) 12 ml/kg Answer: B Synchronous intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) and assist-control ventilation (A/C) are versatile modes that can be used for initial settings. Lower tidal volumes (TV) are recommended than in the past years, when tidal volumes of 10-15 mL/kg were routinely used. This is thought to reduce barotrauma. An initial TV of 5-8 mL/kg of ideal body weight is generally recommended. The lower range is recommended in the presence of obstructive airway disease and ARDS. The goal is to adjust the TV so that plateau pressures are less than 35 cm H2 O. What is the correct initial treatment for sedation ? A) Lorazepam 5 mg by mouth B) Haloperidol 10 mg intramuscular and lorazepam 2 mg intramuscular C) Haloperidol 5 mg PO D) Lorazepam 2 mg intramuscular E) Place IV fi rst Answer: B This is a medical emergency that requires rapid action, for patient, staff, and fellow patient safety. The acutely agitated patient often does not have IV access, and gaining access is often diffi cult. Both benzodiazepines and atypical antipsychotics have shown similar effectiveness in reducing aggression and time to sedation when use as single agents. Oral medications have been shown to have similar onset of action compared to intramuscular (IM) administration, are less invasive, and are more widely accepted by patients. However in this situation the risk of harm to patient and the staff is too high that attempting an oral route may not be successful. A few randomized trials have indicated that the combination of a benzodiazepine with a traditional or classic antipsychotic results in a more rapid onset of sedation with a similar adverse effect profi le. In this situation, a combination approach may be the most effective. This approach is commonly used by physicians in correctional facilities. A dose of 10 mg of haloperidol and 2 mg of Ativan intramuscularly is often suggested.",

Neurologic manifestations are extensive. They include alteration in mental status, seizures, hemiplegia, paresthesias, visual disturbance, and aphasia. Severe bleeding from thrombocytopenia is unusual, although petechiae are common. Other clinical features may include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain with or without elevations of serum amylase and lipase levels. Differentiation of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and TTP can be problematic, although treatment protocols may be the same. Plasma exchange may be considered for both. It is often based on the presence of central nervous system involvement in TTP and the more severe renal involvement in HUS. A peripheral blood smear is essential to determine whether the anemia is caused by a microangiopathic hemolytic process, as indicated by the presence of schistocytes. This patient has fever in association with neurologic symptoms, anemia, and thrombocytopenia with normal coagulation parameters (prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time) and a peripheral blood smear showing fragmented erythrocytes (schistocytes), the hallmark of a microangiopathic process. Plasma exchange should be instituted emergently at diagnosis because 10 % of patients die of this disease despite therapy.",

A) Alzheimer disease B) Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease C) Dementia with Lewy bodies D) Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) E) Multi-infarct dementia Answer: E This patient has the clinical features of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). This includes an emphasis on prominent personality and behavioral changes with less prominent memory loss early in the course. The approach to treatment may be different with FTD as compared to Alzheimer disease. Generally, cholinesterase inhibitors are not recommended for patients diagnosed with FTD. People with FTD usually tolerate SSRIs well, and they are generally considered the best available medications for controlling problematic behaviors. Antipsychotics should be used with caution. Their potential benefi t must be weighed against potential risks including weight gain, slowing of movement and thinking, accelerating heart disease, and, in rare instances, death. Typical antipsychotics should be avoided, since patients with FTD are likely to show muscle stiffness and trembling which may be made worse with typical antipsychotic use. The main clinical features of CJD are dementia that progresses rapidly over months and startle myoclonus, although the latter may not be present early in the illness. Other prominent features include visual or cerebellar disturbance, pyramidal/extrapyramidal dysfunction, and akinetic mutism. Dementia with Lewy bodies is accompanied by parkinsonism, visual hallucinations, and fl uctuating symptoms. The characteristic cognitive profi le of dementia in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies includes impaired learning and attention, psychomotor slowing, and constructional apraxia, but less memory impairment than in similarly staged patients with Alzheimer disease.",

A) Bile-salt-induced diarrhea B) Diabetic gastropathy C) Irritable bowel syndrome D) Lactose malabsorption E) Microscopic colitis Answer: D This patient has lactose malabsorption that developed as a result of her recent food-borne illness or gastroenteritis. This is a relatively common occurrence, may occur after a nonspecifi c gastrointestinal event, and is usually selflimited. Estimating the stool osmotic gap using stool electrolytes evaluates for the presence of an osmotic diarrhea. A gap greater than 100 mOsm/kg (100 mmol/kg) indicates an osmotic cause of diarrhea. Lactose malabsorption is the most common cause of a stool osmotic gap. Reducing this patient's lactose intake will often result in symptom improvement. Lactose intake can slowly be increased as more time elapses and her lactose intolerance improves. Even though some patients may have an increase in stool frequency after cholecystectomy, this patient's surgery was remote enough that it would not cause her current symptoms. Bile-salt-induced diarrhea tends to cause a secretory diarrhea. A stool osmotic gap is not consistent with the diagnosis of IBS. Microscopic colitis causes a secretory diarrhea.",

The clinical value of diagnostic testing to determine the microbial cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is controversial. This hospitalized patient has severe CAP, defi ned as CAP in a patient who requires admission to an intensive care unit or transfer to an intensive care unit within 24 h of admission. The 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society guidelines recommend Streptococcus pneumonia and Legionella urine antigen assays for hospitalized patients with severe CAP. The urinary antigen is useful to confi rm the presence of Legionella or S. pneumonia . However, in HCAP the urinary antigen does not seem to be useful. Legionella should be suspected in this patient, who is older than 50 years of age and presents with severe pneumonia hyponatremia and extrapulmonary symptoms. Bronchoscopy with quantitative culture can be used as a diagnostic tool in the evaluation of patients with ventilatorassociated pneumonia. However, bronchoscopy with quantitative culture has not been prospectively studied for the management of patients with severe CAP. Serologic testing for atypical pathogens such as Legionella species is not recommended because convalescent titers would need to be obtained 6 to 8 weeks after initial testing to establish a diagnosis.",

A) ASCA and ANCA B) ASCA and anti-CBIR1 C) ASCA and anti-OmpC D) NOD-2 SNP testing E) Fecal calprotectin Answer: A Currently, no laboratory test is specifi c enough to adequately and defi nitively establish the diagnosis of IBD. Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies(ASCA) is the most sensitive serologic marker of Crohn's disease. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA) are a serologic marker of patients with ulcerative colitis. The combination of positive pANCA and negative ASCA has high specifi city for ulcerative colitis, whereas a positive ASCA and negative pANCA are more specifi c for Crohn's disease. There primary use has been in differentiating Crohn's from ulcerative colitis and occasionally as a screening test in select patients. Answer: D Chikungunya fever is a self-remitting febrile viral illness that has been associated with frequent outbreaks in tropical countries and returning travelers. The illness has recently become a concern in Western countries and temperate zones around the world. International travel is one of the major risk factors for the rapid global spread of the disease. Patients present with abrupt onset of infl uenza type symptoms. Fever can reach up to 40.5 \u00b0C (105\u00b0), with shaking chills that last 2-3 days. The fever may return after an afebrile period of 4-10 days. Chikungunya infection is confi rmed via serological tests, which take about 5-7 after the onset of symptoms. Severe arthralgia is best managed with nonsteroidal antiinfl ammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and early physical therapy. Ribavirin and steroids have been used but no studies have proven their benefi t. As of September 2014, there have been seven confi rmed cases of chikungunya in the United States in people who had acquired the disease locally.",

The recommended duration of antibiotic therapy for bone infections if identifi ed has traditionally been six weeks.

Fluid resuscitation is a critical component of treating patients with DKA. Insulin therapy will cause intracellular transport of glucose which may result in a significant fluid shift from the extracellular to the intracellular compartment. This may increase the risk of hypovolemic shock and thromboembolism. Insulin should be started after IV fluid replacement is started.

Some studies have suggested that linezolid is better than vancomycin against probable MRSA nosocomial pneumonia. This may be due to the fact that the penetration of linezolid into bronchial fl uids is much higher than that of vancomycin. However this is debated.

Thiamine (vitamin B1) defi ciency can result in Wernicke encephalopathy (WE). It is typically a triad of acute mental confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia. Symptoms develop 4 to 12 weeks postoperatively. WE is a medical emergency and requires immediate administration of IV thiamine. Frequently unrecognized, WE is more prevalent than commonly considered. Ocular abnormalities are the hallmarks of WE. The oculomotor manifestations are nystagmus and bilateral and lateral rectus palsies. The most common presenting symptoms of WE are mental status changes. Ataxia is due to a combination of polyneuropathy, cerebellar damage, and vestibular paresis. It is important to test for truncal ataxia with the patient sitting or standing.

Those at highest risk are farmers, and workers in facilities that use animal products, especially previously contaminated goat hair, wool, or bone.

A) Morphine 2 mg IV every 2 h PRN for pain B) Senna/docusate one tab PO BID C) Acetaminophen 500 mg PO every 6 h PRN pain D) Sodium bicarbonate 650 mg PO BID Answer: B Acetaminophen would not benefi t this patient because it is indicated to treat mild to moderate pain, and the PRN indication is not consistent with the patient's current condition. Morphine is a good opioid analgesic for severe pain experienced in a sickle cell crisis but would represent a therapeutic duplication as hydromorphone is already on the patient's profi le.

A 35-year-old woman with a history of ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis is scheduled for an elective biliary dilation for recurrent biliary stricture. She is hemodynamically stable, afebrile, and without leukocytosis on laboratory workup. What is the most appropriate step regarding pre-ERCP prophylaxis? A) Ciprofl oxacin starting before the procedure and continuing for 7 days B) No antibiotics needed C) Ciprofl oxacin given once, one hour before the procedure D) Hold the procedure until the patient receives a full course of ciprofl oxacin E) Ciprofl oxacin given once following the procedure only if successful biliary dilation not achieved Answer: C According to guidelines on antibiotics in gastrointestinal endoscopy, patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis have a higher risk of incomplete biliary drainage during ERCP and therefore routine single dose pre-procedural ciprofl oxacin is recommended. There is no requirement for a full course of antibiotics. ERCP for hilar cholangiocarcinoma also requires this regimen. It is uncertain if antibiotic prophylaxis is benefi cial for all patients undergoing ERCP. A meta-analysis of fi ve randomized, placebo-controlled trials failed to show a decrease in the incidence of cholangitis and/or sepsis with routine antibiotic prophylaxis prior to ERCP in noncomplicated cases. However, this issue has not been resolved. More trials are required to prove the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics in this setting.",

A) Oseltamivir B) Zanamivir C) Peramivir D) No treatment Answer: A Much of our information concerning the treatment of severe infl uenza comes from the 2009 H1N1 epidemic. In those patients, therapy with oseltamivir reduced length of hospital stay, need for intensive care, and progression to severe disease or death. Ideally oseltamivir should be administered within 48 h of symptom onset. For critically ill patients with infl uenza infection, initiation of oseltamivir therapy up to 6-8 days from onset of symptoms may reduce mortality. Adjuvant treatments are often considered for patients with life-threatening illnesses related to infl uenza. A study from Argentina described excellent outcomes in 13 patients with presumed H1N1 infl uenza A pneumonitis receiving a combination of oseltamivir and methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg/ day) or hydrocortisone (300 mg/day). However, previous studies during earlier viral epidemics failed to demonstrate a benefi cial effect of corticosteroids. Severe and even fatal bronchospasm has been reported during treatment with zanamivir, and it should not be in individuals with underlying airway diseases. Peramivir has not been extensively tested.. The drug was used on a compassionate and emergency basis during the H1N1 pandemic. It appeared to be relatively well tolerated but too few patients were enrolled to establish its effi cacy. Its advantage is that it can be given intravenously.",

Prolonged intubation is another risk factor. His profound weakness is out of proportion to what is expected from deconditioning. The diffi culty with extubation and proximal limb weakness are classic fi ndings as well. For uncertain reasons, creatinine kinase can be elevated. The diagnosis of CIM is a clinical diagnosis, as there is no single laboratory, imaging, or nerve conduction test available to accurately make the diagnosis. Screening tools such as the Medical Research Council (MRC) score are primarily used in research but may gain acceptance as studies confi rm their validity. Prevention and treatment of CIM have focused on limiting vasopressors, sedation, corticosteroids, and other medications that may be a factor in disease progression. Early physical therapy, electrical muscle stimulation, and immunoglobulins are also being investigated as possible treatment options. Little information exists on the long-term outcomes of patients with CIM. One limited study found that recovery from CIM was slow, with nearly all patients displaying abnormal clinical fi ndings 1.5 years after the onset of this syndrome.",

In the past year, he has had three similar episodes, each lasting 2 days. He feels well between episodes. He takes no medications and reports no other medical history. He is sexually active with one partner. On physical examination, the temperature is 38.2 \u00b0C (100.8 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 144/86 mmHg, heart rate is 90/min, and respiration rate is 18/min. There is diffuse abdominal tenderness without rebound. There is no evidence of hepatosplenomegaly. No lymph nodes are palpable. The left knee has a small effusion. Flexion of the knee is limited to 90\u00b0. A well-demarcated, raised, erythematous rash is noted on the right lower extremity overlying the shin. It is tender to touch.Laboratory studies reveal an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 56 mm/h. Screening antinuclear antibody test results are negative. Urinalysis reveals 1+ protein with no cells or casts. Colchicine is the standard therapy. It reduces both acute attacks and amyloidosis. Adult-onset Still disease (AOSD) which may have a similar presentation is characterized by fever, rash, joint pain, and serositis. Pleuritis or pericarditis may occur. Fever associated with AOSD is quotidian, lasting less than 4 h, and often peaks in the early evening. The characteristic rash is evanescent, salmon-colored, and not painful. Abdominal pain is rare. Finally, a markedly elevated serum ferritin level occurs in most patients with AOSD. The plasma p24 antigen test is highly specifi c for HIV infection but is not as sensitive as the HIV RNA assay. Patients typically have a high level of viremia. They are highly infectious at this stage. Plasma HIV RNA level of several million HIV RNA copies per milliliter of plasma are usually seen.

On physical examination, minimal ascites is noted. Blood pressure is 90/50. Chemistries reveal a creatinine of 5.3 mg/dL and a BUN of 42 mg/d/L. Urine sodium is noted to be 5 mEq/L. Urine volume in the fi rst 24 h of admission is 120 mL/day. No red blood cells are noted on initial exam. Initial treatment includes which of the following? A) Supportive care and IV hydration B) Furosemide 80 mg IV push with albumin C) Volume expansion with albumin 25 %, 1 g/kg D) Intravenous albumin, midodrine, and octreotide E) Large volume paracentesis Answer: D This patient's diagnosis is consistent with hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) . Most individuals with cirrhosis who develop HRS have nonspecifi c symptoms, such as fatigue or malaise. Diagnosis of HRS is based on the presence of acute renal failures in the absence of other causes in patients with chronic liver disease. Clues to diagnosis include suddenly worsening renal function, a urine sodium <10 mEq/L, decreased urine output, and a relatively inactive urine sediment. Urinary indices are not considered reliable as they may be variable in HRS. Intravenous albumin, midodrine, and octreotide have been shown to increase renal function and decrease mortality in hepatorenal syndrome. These medicines should be started as well as achieving an increase of 15 mmHg in mean arterial pressure. Reference Moreau R, Lebrec D.

Initially, he reported some mild erythema of the arm which was stable. Over the past 24 h, he has developed increasingly intense pain and swelling in the arm. He also reports an increased temperature and mild shortness of breath.On physical exam, the arm is noted to be markedly swollen. It is extremely tender to mild touch. His temperature is 38.8 \u00b0C (101.8 \u00b0F), BP is 110/60. Initial therapy should includes: A) Surgical consultation B) Irrigation of the wound with sterile saline C) Incision and drainage in the emergency department D) Urgent CT scan of the arm E) MRI of the arm Answer: A This patient has an abscess or necrotizing fasciitis, possibly caused by Clostridium species due to exposure of decomposing biomaterial. Clostridial gangrene is a highly lethal necrotizing soft tissue infection of skeletal muscle caused by toxin-and gas-producing Clostridium . Exotoxins as opposed to an immune reaction are the primary cause of tissue swelling. Frank pus is often absent. Swelling, pallor, and tenderness rapidly develop. Crepitus may also be present. Patients with necrotizing fasciitis have pain out of proportion to their physical exam fi ndings. Necrosis can spread as fast as 2 cm/h. This may result in systemic toxicity and shock that can be fatal within 12 h. Clostridium perfringens is prevalent in soil and is the most common species associated with infection. Treatment is urgent with aggressive surgical debridement as well as intravenous antibiotics. Consultation with a surgeon should not be delayed by imaging. Hyperbaric oxygen has been utilized as an adjuvant therapy in many situations.ReferenceLarson CM, Bubrick MP, Jacobs DM, West MA.

Her insulin pump is not adequate for titration and should be stopped. An insulin drip should be started and monitored, with glucose and electrolyte levels being measured every 1-2 h per DKA protocols. After resolution of her DKA, she should be transitioned to her basal insulin. In her case, the use of an insulin pump may require consultation with her clinic endocrinologist to determine her discharge home dose.ReferenceWallace TM, Matthews DR.

Three clinical factors may be considered in determining the severity of COPD exacerbation: dyspnea, sputum volume, and sputum purulence. Antibiotic treatment is recommended for moderate or severe exacerbations. This includes greater than two clinical factors. Several studies have shown improved clinical response with the use of the antibiotics in this group. Long-term antibiotics show no additional benefi ts and increase both expense and risk. Without evidence of sepsis or the need for an intensive care unit admission, broad-spectrum antibiotics is not indicated. Focused antibiotics, perhaps on a rotating basis if there are multiple exacerbations, are the best option. Reference Quon BS, Gan WQ, Sin DD. Contemporary management of acute exacerbations of COPD. Chest . 2008;133:756-766.92. A72-year-old man is readmitted with acute dyspnea and hemoptysis. Seven days prior to this current admission, the patient underwent emergency surgery for a ruptured diverticula that required an open procedure. He was discharged from the hospital 2 days ago. CT pulmonary angiography shows two pulmonary emboli in the right pulmonary artery branches to the upper and middle lobes.On physical exam, his weight is 80 kg. Heart rate is 110 beats/min, respirations are 22 per minute, and blood pressure is 105/68 mmHg. Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry ranges from 90 to 93 % on oxygen at 6 L/min. Laboratory values are signifi cant for hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL, a platelet count of 68,000/\u03bcL, and serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL. A preoperative platelet count was 177,000/\u03bcL.Which of the following treatment choices should be considered now? A) Enoxaparin, subcutaneously B) Fondaparinux, subcutaneously C) Unfractionated heparin, by continuous intravenous infusion D) Alteplase, intravenously Answer: B It is possible that the patient has heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, as his platelet count decreased by more than 50 %, and he has had exposure to subcutaneous heparin, starting 72 h after surgery, thus making fractionated and unfractionated heparin compounds dangerous. HIT antibodies should be drawn. The pentasaccharide fondaparinux can be used in patients with thrombocytopenia, since the drug does not appear to interact with platelets. No routine platelet monitoring is needed. Fondaparinux is contraindicated in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min.ReferencesBlackmer AB, Oertel MD, Valgus JM.

Observation of pleural effusion is reasonable when benign etiologies are likely. This can occur with chronic overt congestive heart failure, viral pleurisy, or recent thoracic or abdominal surgery. Effusions may resolve with antibiotic therapy alone, but complications can occur in about 10 % of parapneumonic effusions. For this reason diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis is recommended. This patient with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had typical symptoms of an acute bacterial pneumonia with development of a parapneumonic effusion. These factors suggest that the patient may have a poor outcome without immediate pleural space drainage. This patient needs close observation in the hospital. He needs follow-up for possible escalation of therapy, repeat radiographs, and possible repeat thoracentesis.ReferenceDiaz-Guzman E, Dweik RA. Diagnosis and management of pleural effusions: a practical approach. Compr Ther. Winter 2007;33(4):237-46.102. A 26-year-old female is admitted with diarrhea, abdominal pain, and ten-pound weight loss over the past few months. She has just completed her 18-month basic science training at medical school in the Caribbean islands. She is back in the United States for her clinical rotations. She has been trying to participate in her rotations but is unable to function. She is referred by her attending physician for admission to the hospital. She is on no medicines and reports no other medical history. Her initial workup is unremarkable. Stool studies are all negative. The patient has mild anemia and increased mean corpuscular volume (MCV).Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Infl ammatory bowel disease B) Irritable bowel disease C) Tropical sprue D) Laxative abuse Answer: C The symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss with recent travel suggest tropical sprue. Findings of steatorrhea, malabsorption, and villous atrophy by biopsy are adequate to make a diagnosis. Response to treatment is considered to be the conclusive evidence that confi rms the diagnosis. An individual needs to be in a tropical country for at least one month to consider this as a diagnosis. The exact etiology of tropical sprue is uncertain. It may be caused by endemic E. coli or Klebsiella .103.A 38-year-old male is admitted with the acute onset of fever and headaches for the past two days. He denies any recent sick contacts.

In 2013, the FDA approved PCC therapy in adult patients needing an urgent surgery or other invasive procedure.Although not as commonly used and expensive, PCC may have several advantages. PCCs can be administered more rapidly, do not require a crossmatch, and are virally inactivated. In addition, they require less volume. There are no antidotes for many of the novel oral anticoagulants, although PCC and recombinant activated factor VII have been used with some reported success. Treatment with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) does carry an extremely small risk of virus transmission.ReferenceAgeno W, Gallius AS, Wittkowsky A, et al.

A) Proceed with the insertion of a line in the right external jugular vein. B) Insert a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line on the same side. C) Obtain blood cultures. D) Consider other options. Answer: D Ultrasound has become a valuable tool in line placement, but additional caution must be undertaken with its use. The external jugular connects with the internal jugular. Inserting a line here would not be a good option due to the possibility of dislodging a clot. In addition, the clot may extend to the subclavian, which would make placing a PICC line on the same side risky.

A few studies have looked at the benefi ts of renal-artery stenting with mixed results. In general the use of renal-artery stents has declined. The CORAL study provides the most defi nitive evidence to date that renal-artery stents are of limited benefi t. In the CORAL study, there were no differences in individual end points or in rates of all-cause mortality.

Variceal bleeding is often the fi rst manifestation of splenic vein thrombosis (SVT). There is often no obvious underlying cause to SVT. In patients who have isolated fundal varices, splenic vein thrombosis should be ruled out. Ultrasonography is the test of choice.

Mucosal biopsy shows a thickened subepithelial layer with collagen deposition. Which is likely the diagnosis? A) Irritable bowel syndrome B) Lymphocytic colitis C) Celiac sprue D) Ischemic colitis E) Collagenous colitis F) Crohn's disease Answer: E Microscopic or collagenous colitis occurs primarily in middle-aged to older-aged women. It may be associated with other autoimmune diseases, prescription drug use, and smoking. Microscopic colitis should be considered in any patient with unexplained nonbloody persistent diarrhea. The diagnosis is made solely by histology fi ndings. Treatment should be initiated with the least toxic regimen or medication. Stronger medication should be used only if milder treatment fails. Treatment regimens should be switched cautiously with 4-6 weeks before deeming a particular medication as ineffective.222. A 75-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension, coronary arterial disease, and dementia presents with worsening mild confusion from the nursing home. He currently takes aspirin and lasix. He has been getting more confused for the past two days. No recent history of head trauma.On physical exam, his temperature is 37.4 \u00b0C (99.4 \u00b0F) and blood pressure is 120/78 mmHg. He has mild confusion but not much change from his baseline. Labs revealed normal serum electrolytes; urinalysis demonstrated positive nitrites, large WBC esterase, and microscopy reveled 30 WBC and 20 RBC. The plan is to discharge patient back to the nursing home with antibiotic treatment. Medication-related problems are common, costly, and often preventable. Avoiding the use of inappropriate and highrisk drugs is an important, simple, and effective strategy in reducing medication-related problems and adverse drug reactions in older adults. A list of avoidable medicines was developed and published by Beers and colleagues for nursing home residents in 1991 and subsequentlyexpanded and revised in 1997,2003, and  2012. It includes a list of all medications that should be avoided in the elderly. This patient has a UTI, and nitrofurantoin, which is associated with renal failure in the elderly, should be avoided. The rest of the antibiotics mentioned are relatively safe in elderly.Reference Jano E, Aparasu RR. Healthcare outcomes associated with Beers' Criteria: A systematic review. Ann Pharmacother2007;41:438-447.   223. A 58-year-old female is admitted for reduced urine output for the past two days. She has a history of osteoarthritis, hypertension, gout, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She is currently on insulin, allopurinol, and hydrochlorothiazide and takes ibuprofen and naproxen. She recently was seen by a primary care physician for sore throat and was prescribed a 10-day course of ampicillin, which she fi nished yesterday. Blood tests on admission reveal a serum creatinine of 3.4 mg/dl with a BUN of 42 mg/dl. Urinalysis showed numerous WBC and no RBC and no eosinophils. Due to her medicines and presentation, the diagnoses of interstitial nephritis is considered.Answer: E Many drugs are implicated in interstitial nephritis, including antibiotics, proton-pump inhibitors, allopurinol, and NSAIDs. NSAID-induced interstitial nephritis presents with the absence of eosinophils on urine microscopy. With the exceptions of interstitial nephritis induced by NSAIDs, patients commonly present with rash, fever, eosinophilia, eosinophiluria, and elevated immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels. Recovery in renal function is usually observed after cessation of the offending agent. Implementing a short course of steroid therapy is generally recommended for patients that do not have a rapid recovery. No controlled studies exist on the effect of corticosteroids. Most practitioners recommend a relatively high dose with a rapidly tapering regimen within several weeks.ReferenceDe Broe ME, Elseviers MM. Over-the-counter analgesic use. J Am Soc Nephrol. 7 2009",

A 75-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, and cholelithiasis is admitted with RUQ pain. She is on daily aspirin and clopidogrel. An abdominal ultrasound reveals several stones in the gallbladder, a stone in the distal common bile duct without evidence of common bile duct dilation. She is hemodynamically stable and afebrile. Her white blood cell count is normal. On admission her AST is 450 units/L . ALT is 434 units/L. Total bilirubin is 5.8 \u03bcmol/L. The next morning her AST is 400 units/L, ALT is 385 units/L, and total bilirubin is 5.0 \u03bcmol/L. Hold clopidogrel, observe, and plan elective ERCP in 7 day. C) ERCP now. D) Proceed with laparoscopic cholecystectomy. E) Hold clopidogrel and plan elective ERCP in 3-6 months.Answer: B This patient has choledocholithiasis with possible obstruction. At the current time there is no evidence of cholangitis. Her current laboratory workup reveals a decline in the degree of obstruction consistent with a passed stone. An emergent ERCP or cholecystostomy is not indicated at this time. The best plan for this patient would be to hold clopidogrel and proceed with an elective inpatient ERCP with sphincterotomy and stone extraction after seven days. An ERCP done while on clopidogrel would make sphincterotomy risky. In the interim, antibiotics may be started and observed for obstruction requiring urgent decompression or ERCP without sphincterotomy.228. An 82-year-old female presents with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. She states that two weeks prior, she describes a viral-type upper respiratory illness. On presentation, she is noted to have a multilobar loculated infi ltrates. Blood cultures taken at the time of admission grow out methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA). She reports a signifi cant allergy to vancomycin. Her temperature on presentation is 39 \u00b0C (102.2 \u00b0F), pulse rate is 120 per minute, respirations are 30 per minute, and blood pressure is 110/60. Diffuse crackles are noted throughout her left and right lung fi elds. Cardiac examination reveals tachycardia.",

A 57-year-old man was diagnosed three months ago with grade II astrocytoma. He is admitted for new onset seizure. While in the hospital the second day, he develops acute shortness of breath. CT angiogram reveals acute right-sided massive pulmonary embolism. Bedside echocardiogram by the on call cardiology fellow shows right ventricular dilatation and strain. The patient's blood pressure is 75/50 mmHg. What is the best management option? A) Thrombectomy B) Low-molecular-weight heparin C) Unfractionated heparin D) Fondaparinux E) Thrombolytics Answer: A Guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHA) advise that either catheter embolectomy and fragmentation or surgical embolectomy should be considered for patients with massive pulmonary embolism who have contraindications to fi brinolysis. Thrombolytics are relatively contraindicated for this patient with his recent diagnosis of intracranial neoplasm.

She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and was subsequently intubated. On day three she was extubated and transferred to the fl oor. On day fi ve she spiked a low-grade temperature and blood cultures from that day subsequently grew Candida albicans . Her vital signs are stable. She was started on intravenous fl uconazole and vancomycin. What is the next appropriate step? A) Remove all lines and start difl ucan B) Start double antifungal therapy C) Start an echinocandin D) Ophthalmology consult E) A and D Answer: E In patients without neutropenia, fl uconazole is the drug of choice in most cases of candidemia and disseminated candidiasis. An echinocandin is recommended for candidemia in most patients with neutropenia. A critical component in the management of candidemia and disseminated candidiasis is the removal of the possible focus of infection, such as intravenous and Foley catheters. Double antifungal therapy is not needed for management of candidemia. A number of studies have shown that in the setting of candidemia, ocular problems such as endophthalmitis may develop in about 1 % of all patients with candidemia, and 2-9 % of patients might develop less serious eye diseases, including chorioretinitis. The 2009 Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines suggest getting an ophthalmologic consultation 1 week after the onset or detection of illness, evaluating for ocular involvement.
