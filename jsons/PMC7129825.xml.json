Localization of function in the spinal cord causes a similar pathologic process to result in many different clinical presentations, depending on what part(s) of the spinal cord it affects. For example, a spinal cord mass located at the level of C3 vertebra may result in tetraparesis, whereas the identical mass located at the level of T13 vertebra may result in paraparesis with the thoracic limbs unaffected. Furthermore, localization of function in the spinal cord renders it vulnerable to focal lesions that in other organs where function is more uniformly distributed might not result in detectable clinical signs. For example, a small infarction of the cervical spinal cord may result in tetraplegia, whereas a similar lesion occurring in hepatic parenchyma probably would not compromise liver function.",

The pathologic reactions of the spinal cord to disease are to a degree nonspecific so that with the exception of neoplasia and congenital malformations various disorders may induce a somewhat similar histologic appearance. Clinical syndromes affecting the spinal cord may be characterized by a single focal lesion (transverse myelopathy) or by several focal lesions (multifocal disorders). Certain diseases may have adiffuse (or disseminated) distribution. Myelopathies may be extrinsic, in which spinal cord dysfunction is secondary to diseases of the vertebrae, meninges, or epidural space, or may beintrinsic, in which the disease begins as an intramedullary lesion. Extrinsic myelopathies are almost always transverse myelopathies.",

            "text": "Prognosis for an animal with spinal cord injury depends on numerous factors, with results of the neurologic examination being the major determinant. The most important factor in neurologic prognosis is the presence or absence of pain perception. The loss of \u2018superficial\u2019 pain perception occurs with less severe lesions than those resulting in loss of \u2018deep\u2019 pain perception. In general, animals in which any degree of pain perception is detected with certainty can be expected to be restored to locomotion. The more severe the depression of pain perception, the longer the recovery period. In severe injuries, where pain perception has been absent for a brief period, recovery may require months and residual ataxia and paresis may persist. Most animals in which pain perception has been absent for 24 h or more cannot be restored to locomotion, although occasional recoveries have been seen in such cases.",
