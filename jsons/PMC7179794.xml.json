As such, small centers or specialized offices are preferred. In the event that imaging technology is not available in small offices, this analysis should be postponed if not urgent. Furthermore, the lead surgeon can successfully focus on the referral of patients for local care, using the link with former fellows and colleagues that practice on country sites, promoting scientific and clinical exchange, to reduce the need for traveling and visiting of larger reference centers, thereby decreasing risk of contamination. The importance of the mentor-trainee relationship was highlighted by Schiller and DiGiovanni who argued that the relationship established between a resident and their foot and ankle mentor appears to have the greatest impact on pursuing foot and ankle surgery as a career [10]. Accordingly, this interpersonal connection can be used to foster care and trust, maintain patient care and minimize the risk of patient\u2019s contamination and spread of the COVID-19 outbreak.",
