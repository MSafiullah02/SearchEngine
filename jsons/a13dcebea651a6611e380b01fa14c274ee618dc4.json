In these cases, dental procedures should be postponed, and health authorities should be notified.

Although it was hypothesized a potential interaction between ibuprofen use and SARS-CoV-2 (13) , there is no current evidence that this drug aggravates COVID-19 infection in any age group. Recently, the World Health Organization disclaimed there is contraindication for the use of ibuprofen in patients with COVID-19. \u2022 To provide staff education and the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including N95 respirators, clinical gloves, safety glasses, hair covers and disposable aprons. A N95 respirator is a respiratory protective device designed to achieve a very close facial fit and very efficient filtration of airborne particles. N95 respirators block at least 95% of very small (0.3 micron) test particles. A surgical mask is a loose-fitting, disposable device that creates a physical barrier between the mouth and nose of the wearer and potential contaminants in the immediate environment (14) . Current evidence shows that N95 respirators appeared to have a protective advantage over surgical masks in laboratory settings and on procedures that generate aerosols, but the results from clinical studies are inconclusive regarding acute respiratory infections (15, 16) . For patients in health facilities, the use of surgical masks seems rational (17). \u2022 To clean hands with soap and water or hand rub with 70% ethanol or 70% isopropanol (18) , before and after assistance.
