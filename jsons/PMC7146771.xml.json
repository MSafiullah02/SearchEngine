In 1967, the National Library of Medicine of the United States included bronchiolitis as a MeSH descriptor (bronchiolitis, viral).",

Some authors have even questioned its being a distinct entity.5 Various scientific societies, quality assessment agencies and individual experts have developed criteria for the clinical diagnosis of AB, which differ on significant aspects.4 The case definitions and inclusion criteria used in clinical trials of AB are also heterogeneous, and many studies have considered eligible any infants with \u201csigns and symptoms consistent with bronchiolitis\u201d, with the authors simply stating that they applied one or other \u201cwidely accepted\u201d definition of AB.6, 7\n",

We calculated the sample size based on the estimation that the population of paediatricians in Spain is of approximately 10 000. We assumed the case of maximum uncertainty, and estimated a necessary sample size of 965 for a level of confidence of 95% and a precision of 3% (see Appendix B for details).4)Analysis. We performed a descriptive analysis of the questionnaire items and assessed the association between the answers and demographic variables such as age, sex, place of residence and main professional activity (subspecialty) by means of the \u03c7\n2 test, Mann\u2013Whitney U test and Spearman correlation coefficient. Applying predefined criteria (Appendix B, Table S6), we identified the answers that were consistent with 2 of the most widely used definitions of AB (McConnochie,20 NICE10) and with the expert consensus reached in the preceding Delphi process. We analysed whether the variables under study could be reduced to a smaller number of criteria by means of factor analysis (Appendix B). Subsequently, for each identified factor, we analysed whether there were differences in the factor scores based on the aforementioned demographic variables using the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Spearman correlation coefficient. We defined statistical significance as a P-value of less than .05.\n",

Clinical paediatricians do not frequently use standardised criteria, but most consider that the diagnosis should be restricted to first episodes and to the first 24 months of life. The importance given to different signs or symptoms varied depending on the type of professional activity. Hospital specialists, such as intensivists or neonatologists, underscored the relevance of dyspnoea, while coryza in AB was mainly taken into consideration by primary care paediatricians.

Over 40 years ago, McIntosh stated, in regard to bronchiolitis, that \u201cClinicians who care for small children all know what this means\u201d.21 This certainty seems to now be faltering, assuming it ever existed. The criteria used for diagnosis differ between countries (for instance, between the United States and northern Europe) and between the physicians in charge of these patients.17 It is known that the treatment approach chosen in children with manifestations of AB is associated with the diagnostic \u201clabel\u201d assigned to the case,8 and some authors have even argued that the alleged ineffectiveness of pharmacotherapy in AB is due to an inadequate definition of AB.5\n",

There are other definitions, however, that propose a limit of 12 months,21, 24, 25, 26, 27 and some highlight that most cases of AB occur in infants aged less than 6 months.14, 28, 29 Definitions proposed by Scandinavian authors tend to have a lower age limit.29, 30, 31 Among the scarce evidence that may contribute to resolve this issue, we ought to highlight a Spanish community-based study of incident cases that identified a specific wheezing pattern consisting of a single episode typically occurring before age 13 months, with the incidence peak at 7 months.32\n",

In recent years, the conceptualization of respiratory tract diseases has been changing, as their pathophysiology is broken down into components and researchers seek to identify phenotypes and endotypes that may respond differently to treatment.35 Acute bronchiolitis has also been subject to this process. Several severe AB phenotypes have already been identified, and research in this field continues to grow.36 Thus, some of the current evidence suggests that AB due to rhinovirus has specific clinical and epidemiological characteristics37 as well as a different long-term prognosis in relation to atopic asthma.38, 39 A viral aetiology is emphasised in descriptions of AB or specifically included in the definitions of disease proposed by some guidelines,6, 9, 25, 26, 27, 34 and many clinical trials only enrol children with infection by RSV.7 Guidelines do not recommend routine testing for identification of the causative agent. It is possible that detection of RSV would make clinicians lean towards a diagnosis of AB and treatment in adherence to current guidelines, but the benefits of this approach are not actually clear.40 In our panel of Spanish experts there was consensus that viral identification was useful in the diagnosis of AB, but clinical paediatricians did not agree with this opinion.",

We followed international recommendations19 for the selection of experts and in establishing criteria to stop the process and to define the presence of a consensus. As is the case of any form of expert opinion, the results of the consensus process are not based on rigorous evidence, which is a limitation shared by all the diagnostic criteria for AB proposed to date. The online survey methodology entails an inherent participation bias, which is reflected by the fact that nearly 94% of respondents reported frequently managing children with AB. This bias, however, is of little relevance, as the target population of the study was precisely paediatricians that manage children with AB in Spain. We expected participation to be lower among paediatricians who were less interested in this disease, which is why we offered the incentive of the draw for a congress registration, although there is no way of knowing what effect this measure had, if any. The method used for recruitment was flawed, given the gaps that may exist in the databases of the collaborating scientific societies and that some paediatricians may not check their electronic mail often. Although it would be difficult to assess how representative the sample was, we think it is important to consider that there were participants from all autonomous communities and from all subspecialties involved in the management of children with AB. On the other hand, the answers given in the survey may not provide an accurate reflection of real-world clinical practice, and investigation of actual practices was not within the scope of our study.",

Initiatives have been launched, such as the one by the European Respiratory Society (https://taskforces.ersnet.org/item/standardizing-definitions-and-outcome-measures-in-acute-bronchiolitis), to attempt to standardise the diagnosis of AB, but we ought to wonder whether the resulting standard would not be just as arbitrary and flawed as previous definitions.
