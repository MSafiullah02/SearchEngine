The negative charge on the Sia unit has many modulatory roles. In mucins, sialoglycan increases the viscosity of the proteins and protects epithelial cells from bacterial infection. [1] Whereas in cancercells, sialoglycans are overexpressed to safeguardm alignant cells from the immunoevasion of natural killer (NK) cells. [2] In addition to their functiono fp hysically masking cellular biomolecules, Sias participate in major biological events throughs pecific carbohydrate-protein interactions (CPIs). There are more than 50 different types of naturally occurring Sias, which differ in the type of substituents on the hydroxy and amine groups. [3] N-Glycolyl, Nhydroxy, N-acetimidoyl, N-acetyl, and N-lactyl substituents are found on the 5-amino group of Sia, whilst O-acetyl, O-lactyl, Ophosphate, and O-sulfate are examples of substituents that are found on the hydroxy groups.F urthermore, Sias are also linked to penultimate carbohydrate residues, either through a(2-6), a(2-3), a (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) or by a(2-9) glycosidicl inkages.

            "text": "Sia-binding proteins are ubiquitous. These proteins utilize specific sialoglycan structures on cell surfaces to regulate pathogenicity and amultitude of physiological events.For example, humanH 3N2 influenzav iruses utilize the Sia a(2-6) linkaget o induce virulence, whereas avian H5N1 viruses recognize the Sia a(2-3) linkageo nc ell surfaces. [5] Furthermore, Influenza C and coronaviruses preferential bind to N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) and 9-O-acetylated Sia to infect mammalian cells, [6, 7] whilst the simian virus (SV40) recognizes GM1 ganglioside (GM = ganglioside monosialic) as ap referred ligand. [8] A large number of bacteria, such as E. coli, Streptococcus, Helicobacter, and parasites, such as Plasmodium falciparum,a ttack vertebrate cells throughS ia-mediated interactions. B. streptococcus displayed as pecific Sia a(2-3)Gall inkage,w hichb inds to aS ia-binding protein on neutrophils,w eakens the immune responses, and invades the human immune system. [9] Toxins from Vibrio and Clostridium speciesa lso bind to sialogangliosides. [10, 11] Surprisingly,t he AB5 toxin secreted by Shiga toxigenic E. coli binds to Neu5Gcg lycans and induces gastrointestinal disease in humans. [12] On mammalian cell surfaces, Siglecs( sialic-acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectins) ands electinsr epresent two distinct classes of lectin that recognize sialoglycan. Siglecs belong to a major subfamily of type-I lectins,w hich are widely expressed on immune cells and providea na rray of diverse functions based on specific sialoglycan-mediated interactions. [13] Among the familyo fS iglecs, Siglec-2 and Siglec-7 are attractive targets for cancert herapy. [14, 15] Siglec-2 (CD22)i so verexpressed on Bcell lymphomas and leukemia;a ss uch, human anti-CD22 has been used to treat B-cell non-Hodgkin'sl ymphoma. [15] Siglec-7 is expressed on naturalk iller (NK) cells and monocytes cells and it selectively recognizes a(2-8) di-Sia ligands. [16] It has been shown that up-regulating cell-surface Sia on cancerc ells helps them to escape Siglec-7-dependenta ttacks of NK cells; therefore, compounds that exhibit an inhibitory effect towards Siglec-7 can activate NK cells and be used for cancer therapy. [17] Another set of Sia-binding lectins are found on endothelial cells, leukocytes, and platelets, which are classified as E-selectins, L-selectins, and P-selectins, respectively. [18] P-selectin is present on activated plateletsa nd endothelial cells, whereas Eselectin is exposed on the endothelium after activationb yc ytokines, and leukocytes express L-selectin. Ta rgeting P-and Eselectins can be used to monitore ndothelial cells in the early phases of inflammation. Binding to L-selectin enables the visualizationo fl ocal concentrations of leukocytes or can even modulate their function. [19] These lectins bind explicitly to sialyl Lewis x (SL x )a nd sialyl Lewis a (SL a )g lycans, respectively.I nterest-ingly,t umor cells also express the SL x residue, which binds to selectins. Such selectins have ar olei nt umor-cell migration and metastasis. [20] Finally,t he discovery that b-amyloid binds to Sia has had as ignificant impact on thef ield of Alzheimer'sd isease targeting. [21] All of these aforementioned biological eventsa nd many more demonstrate the importanceo fs ialoglycans in biological processes and highlight the potential of these molecules. However,i nvestigating biological processes by using Sia monosaccharide in the solution phase is ah uge challenge, owing to its very weak bindingi nteractions with lectins/proteins, whicha re within the range mm-mm. [22] To overcome this difficulty, multivalent systems have been developed in which clusters that contain many Sia molecules with different topologies have been developed, thus amplifying the effect of the CPIs. [23] Several reviewsh ave been published on the use of multivalent probesi nt argeting aw ide range of carbohydratel igands. [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] This Minireview primarily focuses on multivalent Sia probes to investigate CPIs and biological potency.W ew ill mainly highlight the detailed synthesis of four important multivalent scaffolds, that is,s ialo-polymers, sialo-dendrimers, sialo-nanoparticles, and sialo-liposomes, which have been used to decipher specificC PIs (Figure 1 ). We shalla lso describe the potential applications of multivalent Sia probesi nd rug delivery,i maging, and biosensors.",

Several types of sialonanoparticles have been reported in the literature, the most prevalent of which are gold, silver,s ilica, iron,c admium, seleni-um, and virus-like nanoparticles. Owing to their unique physical properties, these nanoparticles are attractive biomaterials for Sia research. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)h ave been widely used in sialo-nanotechnology,b ecause of their large surface area, electronic conductivity,n ontoxicity,f acile synthesis, and functionalizability,w hich characterize the sialo-conjugates. [63] AuNPsw eres ynthesized by reducing gold(III) chloride in the presence of as uitable surfactant and sodium borohydride. Finally,t hese nanoparticles were functionalized by using suitable sialoside ligands. Sialo-AuNPs can be formed by:1 )direct ligand exchange betweens ialo-functionalized thiol linkers and AuNPs; or 2) coupling reactions between Sia derivatives and functionalized AuNPs.P rocess (1) offers severala dvantages, including control over the number of sialoside ligands per nanoparticlea nd the resultant sialo-AuNPs do not contain additional functional groups,w hichm ay induce nonspecific interactions during CPIs. Ijiro and co-workers synthesized sialo-AuNPs by using directed ligand exchange between sialylated oligosaccharides that contained at hiol linker and AuNPs (5, 10, and 15 nm). [64] These nanoparticles were used to detect the John Cunningham (JC) virus, which displayed 360 copies of Sia-binding virus protein 1( VP1). The specific carbohydrate-protein interactions between VP1 ands ialo-AuNPs resultedi nc lustering of the AuNPs on the surface of the viruses, and led to as ignificant plasmonic shift in UV/Vis absorption spectrum of the AuNPs, which ultimately allowed the sensitive detectiono ft he virus system.S imilarly,F airbanksa nd co-workersr eportedt he synthesis of bi-sialo bi-antennary N-glycan-AuNPs to detect the influenzav irus at nanomolar concentrations ( Figure 8a ). [65] First, they isolated N-glycan from egg yolk and conjugatedi t to NHS-(S)-acetylthioacetic acid active ester (NHS = N-hydroxysuccinimide). Mild deacetylationo ft he glycan afforded ag ood amount of the N-glycan with the thiol linker for direct conjugation onto the AuNPs. The resultants ialo-AuNPs were subjected to colorimetric detection of the influenza virus and the results from these studies confirmed the development of an inexpensive, sensitivep latform for the detection of the influenza virus. As imilarg oal has also driven Haag and co-workers to synthesize Sia-conjugated AuNPs( 2a nd 14 nm) for as ialo-ligand-dependent hemaglutination assay with the influenza virus (Figure 8b ). [66] In yet another development, Russell and co-workers synthesized sialo-AuNPs by using direct ligand exchange to detect mSiglec-E which expressed on CHO cell lines by using a colorimetricm ethod (Figure 8c ). [67] Overall, direct ligand exchange afforded quick access to the sialo-AuNPs, which was an efficient platform for the detection of the influenzav irus. However,t he major limitation of this strategy was the requirement for al arge quantity of sialosidel igands. In such as cenario, process (2) is ideal. However,t he critical requirement of process (2) is to identify mild, efficient coupling reactions that result in neutrale pitopes. Tamiya and co-workers employed ac lick chemistry reaction between as ialoside azide linker and acetylene-functionalized AuNPs to synthesize sialo-AuNPs, which were coated onto ac arbon electrode to fabricatea ne lectro-chemicalA b-peptides biosensor. [68] Similarly,R ussell and coworkers synthesized sialo-AuNPs by using click chemistryt o develop ab iosensor for the detectiono ft he influenza Av irus (Figure 8d ). [69] Nishimura and co-workers employed an oxidecoupling reaction between aminooxy-functionalized AuNPs and as ialosidek etone linker to synthesize sialo-AuNPs, which were used to detect the influenza Avirus. [70] Gold and silver nanoparticles have similaro pticalp roperties, large surface areas, and good conductance. In addition, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) display distinct antimicrobial activities. As such, sialo-AgNPs are useful probesf or the treatment of health-threatening bacteria. Park and co-workers synthesized sialo-AgNPs through the direct autoclaving or microwave irra-diation of Sia ligands and silver(I)nitrate solution. [71] These nanoparticles showedb oth antibacterial (pseudomonasa eruginosa, Escherichia coli,a nd salmonella typhimurium)a nd antiviral (influenzavirus) activities.",
