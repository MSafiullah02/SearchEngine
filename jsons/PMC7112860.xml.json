Isolation in cell cultures is inefficient and monoclonal antibodies for immunofluorescence assay or enzyme immunoassay are not easily available and further testing is required to ensure reliability. Consequently, specific and sensitive molecular diagnostic methods are essential to achieve the accurate detection of human metapneumovirus in clinical specimens. This diagnosis may help the clinical managment of patients and may establish the role of this pathogen in the respiratory infection and its epidemiological behaviour.",

These genes were selected to ensure the detection of human metapneumovirus independently of its genetic variation. The assays, a RT-heminested-PCR and a RT-PCR followed by a reverse line blotting hybridisation assay, had high specifity and sensitivity. Their inclusion as routine diagnosis methods can reduce the number of negative results.

In order to identify genetic variants of the main human metapneumovirus lineages, the design of amplification assays was focused on fragments of two different genes highly conserved. The use of two alternative RT-PCR assays presents the advantage of confirming the positive results in two independent genes and it also guarantees a decrease in the number of false positive results. The RT-heminested-PCR for the matrix gene is easy to perform and do not need high technology requirements. The reverse line blotting protocol for the viral polymerase gene is a safe procedure since non-radioactive reactives are used for labelling the probe and has the advantage of being suitable for large-scale epidemiological screening. The usage of the probe increases the specificity of the assay. In our experience, both methods were reliable and reproducible. Contamination with amplified products is prevented by careful separation of each mixture preparation, extraction, addition of the sample RNA, amplification and postamplification areas. Different sets of laboratory coats, pipettes and filtered pipette tips are used in each different area.",

Nasopharyngeal aspirate was a suitable type of specimen for the specific diagnosis of infections due to respiratory viruses. The specimens were collected from 2000 to 2003, not only during the respiratory virus circulation season but also during the rest of the year. The results provide further evidence that human metapneumovirus accounts for many cases of acute respiratory infection in children of this age, as 16.6% positives were detected in the 300 nasopharyngeal aspirates studied. The analysis of these results suggests that paediatric respiratory disease due to human metapneumovirus may have been underestimated due to the lack of rapid, sensitive and reliable diagnostic methods in most paediatric units. Most of the incidence studies associated with human metapneumovirus reported a lower rate of infection, which corresponded to values between 5 and 10% (Esper et al., 2004, Ijpma et al., 2004, Mackay et al., 2003, van den Hoogen et al., 2003). The percentage obtained in our study would be similar to that reported by Maggi et al. (2003) in Italy and by Viazov et al. (2003) in Germany, who also studied specimens from infants less than 2 years old. Other researchers, who evaluated children older than ours (Boivin et al., 2003, Esper et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003b, Vicente et al., 2003) or a wider age group ranging from children to adults (Stockton et al., 2002) found a lower incidence of human metapneumovirus. Therefore, our results support the views that human metapneumovirus is, after respiratory syncytial virus, an important cause of viral acute respiratory infections in children under 5 years.",

This type of samples had also been tested in other studies (Boivin et al., 2002, Freymouth et al., 2003, Peret et al., 2002). However, when co-infections were studied, some of the researchers concluded that they rarely occurred (Stockton et al., 2002, Vicente et al., 2003). Co-infections would be more numerous if the diagnosis techniques used for common respiratory viruses, mainly cellular cultures and indirect immunofluorescence assays, were as sensitive as the PCR assays are at the moment. Further studies are necessary to obtain a more real analysis of the respiratory virus infections.",

            "text": "Although this is a retrospective study, some epidemiological conclusions may be drawn. Human metapneumovirus positive specimens were collected mainly during the late winter and early spring months. Some positive cases were detected during the rest of the year. In contrast to other studies, no alternative years of high and low incidence were observed (Maggi et al., 2003). The peak of virus detection was found between February and April on the 3 years period from 2000 to 2003. Besides, the onset of respiratory syncytial virus disease was determined between December and January, just before the peak of human metapneumovirus detection, during the same seasons (data not shown). These results confirm that human metapneumovirus circulates primarily during the late winter and early spring, at the end of the circulation of respiratory syncytial virus (Falsey et al., 2003, Maggi et al., 2003, von Linstow et al., 2004). However, positive specimens for human metapneumovirus were also found during the late spring and summer months. Peiris et al. (2003b) reported human metapneumovirus activity in these months too. Nevertheless, few data related to summer months are available, since most of the studies only examined samples collected during winter season. In relation to the age of the children studied, most of the human metapneumovirus infections affected children between 6 and 12 months of age (data not shown), in agreement with previous data (van den Hoogen et al., 2003). Further studies will be needed to determine the real incidence of human metapneumovirus in community-acquired acute respiratory infections in young children in Spain.",

Diagnosis of human metapneumovirus is essential to reduce the number of respiratory infections in which the etiologic agent is not recognized. It should be noted that human metapneumovirus was detected in 16.6% of the subgroup with negative results out of the total 747 nasopharyngeal aspirates, the use of these specific molecular assays have increased at least in 6.7% the number of specimens in which a viral agent could have been determined. The results obtained indicate that human metapneumovirus should be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of acute respiratory infections, mainly to distinguish it from respiratory syncytial virus infections. The RT-PCR based assays described above are specific and sensitive for a rapid and reliable diagnosis of human metapneumovirus in nasopharyngeal aspirates.",
