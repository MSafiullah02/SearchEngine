The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the disease as a pandemic on March 11, 2020 and it is the first such declaration since the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak. As of May 6, 2020, there have been 3,780,513 cases, with a mortality rate of 6.9%, much higher than the initial estimates of 2% provided by the WHO.1 The disease has spread and affected several countries and territories in a variety of ways. The outbreak that began in China engulfed all the continents (except Antarctica) within three months of the first reported case;2 and so far, it has caused more than 261,000 deaths worldwide. Structural configurations within the health delivery systems in affected countries may play a vital role in mitigating deleterious outcome from the pandemic, but research or data supporting this are lacking3. We hypothesize that countries with universal health care (UHC) will perform better in mitigating COVID-19 related mortality.",

Europe also had the highest proportion of all deaths (55.8%). When we compared the CFR across the different regions, we observed that although Asia had the third highest number of cases (601,748) in the world, its CFR ranked as the second lowest (3.5%) after Australia (1.4%); ranked lowest) (Figure 1). A total of 54 countries had more than 5,000 cases, out which 22 countries had a UHC system (40.7%). When these high impact countries were compared based on the presence of UHC or non-UHC, we found that countries with UHC had 13,789,891 cases, which was about 37.6% of all the cases reported globally. However, the countries with UHC experienced a much higher proportion of fatalities (56.4%). The CFR of countries with UHC (10.5%) was more than double that of countries without UHC (4.9%) (Figure 2).",

From our study, we found that, in spite of the fact that the disease originated in Asia and the continent had the highest number of cases before the disease spread more rapidly in other continents, Asian countries have been able to contain the virus much more effectively than the other regions. This could be because of the immediate stern measures taken by Asian countries which helped in faster containment of the outbreak or because the countries in the west seem to have been more complacent, despite getting a head start to prepare.6 Among the 32 countries worldwide that have a universal healthcare system, 22 were highly impacted by the disease so far. Italy, Spain, UK, Germany and France were the countries with the highest number of recorded COVID-19 cases among those with a UHC. Globally, more than 145,000 fatalities were attributed to high impact countries with UHC. There are various benefits of UHC, such as equitable health coverage for the entire population,7 lower cost of healthcare to the economy, reduced administrative costs, etc. Germany has had the lowest CFR among the most impacted countries since the beginning of the pandemic,8 and their success could be attributed to large-scale testing and early detection of the outbreak. Germany also has a much higher number of beds per capita as compared to Italy or Spain, which have a CFR of 13.8% and 10.2% respectively.9",
