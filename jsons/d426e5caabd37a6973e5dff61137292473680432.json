Captive breeding programs, such as that developed for the Columbia Basin (CB) pygmy rabbit (Brachylagus idahoensis), sometimes are implemented as emergency conservation measures to restore small, genetically distinct populations. However, small source populations also may have low genetic diversity, which may influence attributes related to fitness, including growth, survival, and reproduction. We used mixed-effects regression models to explore the influence of genetic pedigree (% CB) on pairing success, growth, and survival during the 10-year captive breeding program at Washington State University, which included controlled pairings and outbreeding with pygmy rabbits from Idaho. Pairing success, juvenile growth, and juvenile survival declined with increasing CB pedigree of 1 or both parents, suggesting inbreeding depression among the small number of related founders. Demographic variables such as age, sex, and previous pregnancies, and environmental variables such as month and temperature at birth also were associated with production of pygmy rabbits. Our study illustrates the difficulty of retaining a unique genome of a small source population while simultaneously producing enough rabbits for restoration into natural habitat as part of endangered species recovery programs.",

            "text": "Although the overall success of reintroduction projects is generally low in mammals (, 50%), a global analysis of 183 species on the IUCN Red List found that captive breeding and reintroduction was twice as effective as creating protected areas at improving the conservation status of mammals (Haywood 2011) . However, projects using captive-bred animals have been significantly less successful than those using translocation of wild animals (Griffith et al. 1989; Wolf et al. 1996; Fischer and Lindenmayer 2000; Jule et al. 2008) . Captive populations require intensive use of resources and are usually small, often with fewer than 20 founders (Witzenberger and Hochkirch 2011) , and may face low genetic diversity and inbreeding, which can reduce survival, fecundity, and disease resistance w w w . m a m m a l o g y . o r g (Roelke et al. 1993; Charpentier et al. 2008; van Coillie et al. 2008; Rabon and Waddell 2010; Cain et al. 2011 ). Furthermore, captive-bred animals are usually less well adapted for wild conditions because captive breeding over several generations may create unique selection pressures influencing physiological, behavioral, and evolutionary changes that compromise fitness in natural environments (Robert 2009 ). However, source populations for translocations often differ genetically from animals in the local restoration area, thus captive breeding may help to retain unique, locally adapted gene complexes that influence fitness (Laikre et al. 2010) . Captive breeding may be the only option when rarity precludes translocations from other populations, as in European rabbits (Delibes-Mateos et al. 2008) , and fecundity and survival are generally higher in captive than in wild populations, which may speed population recovery (Robert 2009 ). Thus, a better understanding of the factors influencing success of captive breeding programs for rare or endangered populations of lagomorphs is an urgent priority to guide future conservation decisions.",

The CB population declined precipitously between 1997 and 2001, resulting in capture of only 16 founders from the last remaining wild population (Becker et al. 2011 ). These founders were highly related (0.33, between a half and full sibling), and the expected heterozygosity (0.40) at 12 microsatellite loci was low compared to that of pygmy rabbits in the core of the range in Oregon, Montana, and Idaho (0.80). The effective population size of the founders was estimated as , 6 animals (Warheit 2004) . Nonetheless, translocation from the core range was rejected as a strategy to recover the CB population, because CB pygmy rabbits had been isolated geographically from the core range for thousands of years (Grayson 1987; Lyman 1991) . Mitochondrial DNA sequence data from 307 base pairs of cytochrome b demonstrated that CB pygmy rabbits had a single haplotype that was not observed in any other population and differed from other haplotypes by 1-3 base pairs (Warheit 2001 After 2 years of unexpectedly low rabbit production at the 3 captive breeding facilities, the CB pygmy rabbit recovery team began a modest outbreeding effort using 4 pygmy rabbits originating from the core range in Idaho to gradually increase genetic diversity, while retaining an average of 75% CB pedigree in the population (i.e., with individuals ranging from 0% to 100% CB) through annual pairing and genetic management plans (Becker et al. 2011) . In this study, we conducted a retrospective analysis of captive breeding at WSU from 2001 to 2010. Our objective was to examine the contributions of the CB pedigree (genome) to measures of rabbit production (i.e., pregnancy, litter size, juvenile growth, and survival) relative to other demographic and environmental variables using mixed-effects regression models and model selection. Because of low heterozygosity and high relatedness, we expected pairing success (pregnancies per pairing attempt), litter size, juvenile growth, and juvenile and adult survival in captive-bred pygmy rabbits to decline with increasing % CB pedigree of the pygmy rabbits. We also expected that parents with more experience (older and those with previous pregnancies) would have greater pairing success, litter sizes, and juvenile growth, and that juveniles born at higher temperatures and later in the season would grow faster and survive better.",

In our largest pens, females and males were kept together continuously through the breeding season or until the male was needed to breed with another female. At least 1 male was present in the pen when the female gave birth to allow for postpartum mating. Males remained in the large pens with the females through the end of June.

Because captive breeding over 10 years necessarily employed adaptive changes in diets, housing, breeding strategies, and medical treatments, the factor ''year'' was treated as a categorical variable and represented unique captive breeding conditions and husbandry practices each year.

We found that the greater the % CB pedigree of females or males, or both, the lower the probability of pregnancy per pairing, and the slower the growth rate and lower the survival of their offspring.

The relative contribution of the pedigrees of male and female parents, and the strength of these effects, differed among the production parameter modeled. The pedigree of the female had a greater negative influence on pairing success compared with that of the male, whereas the pedigree of the sire had a greater negative influence on juvenile growth than that of the dam.

We observed that only a small amount of outbreeding (i.e., , 10% Idaho pedigree) doubled pairing success. In addition, behavioral observations of captive pygmy rabbits at WSU demonstrated that rabbits with 100% CB pedigree took 5 times longer to begin reproductive chases and to copulate after a male was introduced into a female's pen than for male Idaho rabbits (Elias 2004) . Furthermore, CB rabbits had twice as many copulations or attempted copulations, and CB males chased females longer before and after copulation than did Idaho males (Elias 2004) . Similarly, in endangered volcano rabbits, captive populations had lower genetic and allelic diversity than wild populations (Salom\u00f3n Sota et al. 2005 ) and inbreeding was implicated as a potential cause of low reproductive rates (Campos Morales 2009).",

Adult pygmy rabbits in the captive breeding facility were unusually susceptible to avian tuberculosis (Harrenstein et al. 2006) , caused by a ubiquitous mycobacterium that typically only affects animals with compromised immune systems. Because adult rabbits with 100% CB pedigree in our captive breeding program had a less vigorous lymphocyte response compared with animals with a mixture of CB and Idaho pedigree (Harrenstein et al. 2006) , the low genetic diversity within the captive CB population may have contributed to high adult and juvenile mortality from disease. High mortality from disease may have been compounded by the necessity of housing rabbits on soil during the period from breeding through lactation because pygmy rabbits were unable to successfully raise young without a soil substrate for digging natal burrows (B. A. Elias, in litt.).",

No information is available about the effects of temperature and neonatal survival in wild pygmy rabbits, but natal burrows constructed in 0.5-1 m of soil above ground in our captive facility may not have provided an adequate thermal environment for neonates in the colder months early in the breeding season. Juveniles born later in the breeding season also had a greater survival to adulthood. Delaying breeding until temperatures are warmer, providing climate control, or providing deeper soil may improve neonatal survival in captive pygmy rabbits, although this delay would reduce the number of litters that could be produced per animal per season.",

Despite our expectation that older animals (those that had survived 1 breeding season) would be more productive because they may have more energy reserves and more experience, we found that pairing success and survival of neonates was lower for older dams or sires, or both, although older dams did produce larger litters. Females that had a previous litter that breeding season were more likely to become pregnant during a pairing and to produce neonates that survived until emergence, but produced a smaller litter. In contrast, Stott et al. (2008) found that litter size increased with the number of litters produced per female per year in European rabbits, and Rashwan and Marai (2000) found that shortening the birthing interval increased mortality in domestic rabbits. Female juveniles grew faster and had a higher adult mass, but sex was not related to adult survival.",

Juvenile survival was higher in early years of the program, potentially before some pathogens were introduced to, and compounded within, the captive colony. On the other hand, pairing success and juvenile growth were higher in later years, possibly reflecting advances in adaptive management such as diet, housing, cleaning protocols, and medical care designed to improve rabbit production. Because husbandry practices were completely or partially confounded with year, we were unable to examine their individual effects on production. Furthermore, discerning cause-and-effect relationships is difficult in a captive breeding program for an endangered species, which necessarily precludes formal experimentation that could be harmful to some individuals.",

            "text": "In conclusion, declining or endangered species most in need of emergency captive breeding programs are often similar to the CB pygmy rabbit-small populations with low genetic diversity and high genetic differentiation from possible sources for translocation (Brekke et al. 2010; Rabon and Waddell 2010; Cain et al. 2011; Karsten et al. 2011; Roberts et al. 2011 ). Consequently, difficult trade-offs (e.g., demographic, facility logistics, and financial expenses) often must be balanced to adaptively manage population genetics, population size, and production of enough new animals to support both a captive population and reintroduction efforts (van Heezik et al. 2005; Zeoli et al. 2008; Robert 2009 ). In our study, a modest level of outbreeding of CB pygmy rabbits with a genetically distinct population that had higher genetic diversity and larger populations improved pregnancy rates, juvenile growth, and juvenile survival. The default assumption that distinct population segments contain genetic complexes well adapted to local ecological conditions frequently may be offset by the potential for inbreeding depression in populations with low genetic diversity. Thus, we recommend that captive breeding efforts for rare or endangered species consider outbreeding as a potential response even early in recovery programs when fitness measures suggest compromised reproductive performance and survival. Under ideal circumstances, to increase the chances of success in captive breeding of endangered lagomorphs, we recommend frequent monitoring of size and genetic diversity of declining populations of concern and establishing captive breeding programs before such populations become as small and isolated as the CB pygmy rabbit. Captive breeding programs starting with a large number of unrelated founders that are supplemented annually with new founders and continue for a minimal number of generations (, 20) to avoid rapid evolutionary processes associated with adapting to conditions in captivity can be a key component of restoring endangered lagomorphs (Robert 2009; Witzenberger and Hochkirch 2011) . We conclude conserving short-lived, relatively r-selected species, as may characterize numbers of lagomorph species, is challenging, especially when information on reproduction, population and landscape genetics, and associated fitness values is limited or nonexistent. Conservationists must therefore be prepared for the necessity of rapid adaptive management of captive populations, even when critical biological information is limited.",
