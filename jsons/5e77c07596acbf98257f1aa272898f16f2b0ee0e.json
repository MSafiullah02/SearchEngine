The developing embryo and its membranes provide the diversity of cell types that are needed for successful replication of a wide variety of different viruses. Within the family Coronaviridae the embryonated egg has been used as a host system primarily for two avian coronaviruses within the genus Gammacoronavirus , infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and turkey coronavirus (TCoV). The embryonated egg also has been shown to be suitable for isolation and propagation of pheasant coronavirus, a proposed member of the Gammacoronavirus genus. IBV and pheasant coronavirus replicate well in the embryonated chicken egg, regardless of inoculation route; however, the allantoic route is favored as these viruses replicate well in epithelium lining the chorioallantoic membrane, with high virus titers found in these membranes and associated allantoic fl uids. TCoV replicates only in epithelium lining the embryo intestines and bursa of Fabricius, thus amniotic inoculation is required for isolation and propagation of this virus. Embryonated eggs also provide a potential host system for detection and characterization of other, novel coronaviruses.",

The shell membrane lies immediately beneath the shell; this is a tough fi brinous membrane that forms the air sac in the region of the blunt end of the egg (Fig. 1 ) . In contrast to the shell membrane, chorioallantoic, amniotic, and yolk membranes are comprised largely of epithelium, and represent potential sites of coronaviral replication. The chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) lies directly beneath the shell membrane; this is a highly vascular membrane that serves as the respiratory organ of the embryo. The CAM is the largest of the embryo membranes, and it encloses the largest cavity within the egg, the allantoic cavity; in the embryonated chicken egg, this cavity contains approximately 5-10 ml of fl uid, depending upon the stage of embryonation. The amniotic membrane encloses the embryo and forms the amniotic cavity; in the embryonated chicken egg, this cavity contains approximately 1 ml fl uid. The yolk sac is attached to the embryo and contains the nutrients the embryo utilizes during embryonic development and the immediate post-hatch period.",

For avian coronaviruses, inoculation of eggs by allantoic or amniotic routes has been shown to provide these viruses with access to specifi c cell types that support their replication [ 2 -4 ] . IBV is an epitheliotropic virus that replicates in a variety of epithelial tissues in the post-hatch chicken including respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, bursa of Fabricius, and oviduct [ 7 ] . In the embryonated chicken egg, IBV replicates well regardless of inoculation route; however, the allantoic route is favored as the virus replicates extensively in epithelium of the CAM and high titers are shed into allantoic fl uid [ 8 ] . A pheasant coronavirus has been isolated and propagated in embryonated chicken eggs using procedures similar to those utilized for IBV (allantoic route inoculation) [ 3 ] . TCoV also is epitheliotropic in post-hatch chickens and turkeys, but replicates only in epithelium lining the intestinal tract and bursa of Fabricius [ 1 , 4 , 9 ] . These cellular tropisms of TCoV also are observed in the embryonated egg; the virus replicates only in embryonic intestines and bursa of Fabricius, sites that are reached only via amniotic inoculation. 6.

Samples may be shipped on ice, dry ice or with commercially available cold packs ( see Note 2 ).1. Use a vortex mixer to expel material from swabs, then remove and discard swab.

Tissues and feces are prepared as 10-20 % suspensions in DMEM supplemented with FBS and antibiotics. Tissues are homogenized using a mortar and pestle, Ten Broeck homogenizer, or Stomacher R (Fisher). Tissue and fecal suspensions are clarifi ed by centrifugation (1,000-2,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min) in a refrigerated centrifuge; this removes cellular debris and most bacteria.

Eggs are inoculated in a darkened room, as the embryo must be visualized for this method of amniotic inoculation. Hold the egg against an egg candler and insert the needle into the egg and toward the shadow of the embryo. As the tip of the needle approaches the embryo, a quick stab is used to penetrate the amniotic sac. Penetration of the amniotic sac may be verifi ed by moving the needle sideways; the embryo should move as the needle moves ( see Note 4 ).",
