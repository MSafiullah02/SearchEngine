After secretion into the extracellular space, these cytokines circulate in the body and cause susceptible cells to express potent antiviral mechanisms, thus limiting viral spread. Pathogenic viruses, however, have learned to manipulate the IFN system for their own sake. They have evolved efficient escape strategies allowing them to suppress IFN production, to modulate IFN signaling, and to block the action of antiviral effector proteins. This facet of the virus life cycle is only now being fully appreciated. Nevertheless, the first inklings of an anti-IFN activity were noticed early on, soon after the discovery of interferons by Isaacs and Lindenmann in 1957 (Isaacs and Lindenmann 1957) . Lindenmann himself made the surprising observation that infection of cells with a live virus inhibited the subsequent induction of IFN by an inactivated virus. This phenomenon was called inverse interference and was presumably the first description of a viral IFN-suppressive function (Lindenmann 1960) . Since then, great progress has been made in our understanding of how cells recognize viral intruders and how viruses manage to survive in the face of the powerful IFN system (for reviews see Garcia-Sastre and Biron 2006; Goodbourn et al. 2000; Haller et al. 2006 ).",

            "text": "It has become increasingly clear that conserved molecular signatures of viruses serve as danger signals that are recognized by specialized receptors of the host cell. These receptors are collectively called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) because they recognize a diverse range of conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) found in infectious disease agents. The main PAMP of viruses appear to be nucleic acids, such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). The cellular PRRs designed to sense viruses can be divided into the extracellular/endosomal toll-like receptors (TLRs) (Akira and Takeda 2004; Bowie and Haga 2005) and the intracellular receptors RIG-I, MDA-5, and PKR (Meylan et al. 2006) . Signaling through these cellular sensors activates transcription of the IFN genes ( Fig. 1 ) . RIG-I and MDA-5 act trough the adaptor protein IPS-1/MAVS and the kinases TBK-1 and IKK-\u03b5 to activate the transcription factor IRF-3. A parallel pathway involves the dsRNA-binding kinase PKR, the TRAF adaptor molecules and the NF-\u03baB kinase IKK\u03b1/\u03b2. Until very recently, it was assumed that the only molecule that clearly distinguishes viruses from their host (i.e., self vs nonself) is dsRNA, which would act as a danger signal capable of activating the IFN system. This concept was supported by data showing that many RNA and DNA viruses express proteins that bind this key molecule to avoid both IFN induction and activation of dsRNAdependent antiviral enzymes Langland et al. 2006) . Good examples are the NS1 protein of influenza A virus (Garcia-Sastre 2001 Lu et al. 1995; Min and Krug 2006) , the E3L protein of poxviruses (Hornemann et al. 2003; Xiang et al. 2002) , the VP35 protein of Ebola virus Hartman et al. 2006) , the sigma3 protein of reoviruses , and the US11 protein of herpes simplex virus (Mohr 2004; Poppers et al. 2000) . It came therefore as a surprise when it was realized that some viruses do not produce detectable amounts of dsRNA at all ). This unexpected finding indicated that cells must be able to sense other viral molecules important for IFN induction. Indeed, the cytoplasmic receptor RIG-I was subsequently found to bind to the 5\u2032 end of certain viral ssRNA genomes provided they carried a 5\u2032triphosphate group (Hornung et al. 2006; Pichlmair et al. 2006) . Such 5\u2032 triphosphate moieties are usually not present on host RNA species in the cytoplasm and appear to provide an ideal recognition pattern for nonself. In line with this, it was shown that the NS1 of influenza A virus can bind ssRNA as well, and is able to form complexes with RIG-I (Mibayashi et al. 2006; Pichlmair et al. 2006) .",

            "text": "To subvert innate immunity, many viruses interfere with one or several steps in the IFN induction pathway. Figure 1 shows examples of viral antagonists that work at different levels of the signaling pathway. As mentioned above, the dsRNAbinding NS1 protein of influenza A virus binds to both dsRNA and ssRNA presumably by recognizing inter-or intramolecular dsRNA regions. Importantly, NS1 also associates with RIG-I in infected cells and seems to impair its signaling function (Mibayashi et al. 2006; Pichlmair et al. 2006) . In contrast, the V protein of paramyxovirus SV5 has no apparent RNA-binding activity. It inhibits IFN induction by targeting the RIG-I-related RNA sensor MDA-5 (Andrejeva et al. 2004; Childs et al. 2006) . Next in line is the adaptor protein IPS-1/MAVS, which connects the RNA sensors RIG-I and MDA5 with the IRF-3 kinases TBK-1/IKK\u03b5. It is specifically cleaved by the NS3-4A protease of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and additional flaviviruses (Chen et al. 2007; Lin et al. 2006; Meylan et al. 2005) (see also chapter by M. Gale, this volume). Activation of IRF-3 by TBK-1 is prevented by the phosphoprotein P of rabies virus (Brzozka et al. 2005 ) and the G1 glycoprotein of the hantavirus NY-1 (Alff et al. 2006 ). IRF-3 itself is degraded by the NPro proteins of pestiviruses such as classical swine fever virus and of bovine viral diarrhea virus La Rocca et al. 2005; Ruggli et al. 2005 ) via the proteasomal pathway (Bauhofer et al. 2007; . Also, the E6 protein of human papilloma virus 16 binds and inactivates IRF-3 (Ronco et al. 1998) . A sophisticated strategy to block IRF-3 is used by certain herpesviruses. Human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8), the causative agent of Kaposi sarcoma, expresses several IRF homologs, termed vIRFs, which exert a dominant-negative effect (Burysek et al. 1999a (Burysek et al. , 1999b Fuld et al. 2006; Li et al. 1998; Lubyova et al. 2004; Lubyova and Pitha 2000; Zimring et al. 1998) .",

            "text": "While these IFN subversion strategies show a degree of specificity and suggest an intimate co-evolution of viruses and their immunocompetent hosts, other and more basic mechanisms are also exploited by diverse viruses. For example, viruses with a lytic life cycle can afford to target the basic cellular transcription machinery and suppress IFN gene expression through a general shutoff of host gene transcription. For example, the nonstructural NSs proteins of bunyaviruses interfere with the basic cellular transcription machinery Le May et al. 2004; Thomas et al. 2004) . Although this strategy appears to be nonspecific, in vivo experiments with Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV), Punta Toro virus, and Bunyamwera virus clearly demonstrated that the biological purpose of this broad-band shut-off is to inhibit IFN synthesis (Bouloy et al. 2001; Perrone et al. 2007; Weber et al. 2002) . The matrix (M) protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is also a potent host cell shutoff factor that inhibits basal transcription (Yuan et al. 1998 ), impairs nuclear-cytoplasmic transport of RNAs and proteins (Her et al. 1997) , and inactivates translation factors (Connor and Lyles 2002) . As in the case of bunyavirus NSs, the biological significance of M-mediated shutoff is to suppress IFN induction upon VSV infection (Ferran and Lucas-Lenard 1997; Stojdl et al. 2003) . Likewise, proteinases of picornaviruses (e.g., foot and mouth disease virus, Theiler's virus, poliovirus) and pestiviruses (e.g., Classical Swine fever virus) cause a shutoff of the host cell metabolism to interfere with the IFN response (de Los Santos et al. 2006; Delhaye et al. 2004; Lyles 2000; Ruggli et al. 2003 Ruggli et al. , 2005 van Pesch et al. 2001) .",

This pathway is well characterized (Levy and Darnell 2002) and will not be described here in detail. It should be noted, however, that IFN signaling is highly regulated by cellular factors to avoid overstimulation of the system and keep a physiological balance. Negative feedback regulation is mainly mediated by IFN-induced members of the suppressor of the cytokine signaling protein (SOCS) family and the protein inhibitor of the activated STAT (PIAS) family. Essentially, SOCS members inhibit JAK tyrosine kinase activity, while PIAS members work as small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) E3 ligases and inhibit transcriptional activity of activated STAT in the nucleus.",

Depending on viral origin, these IFN antagonists act either by inhibiting the JAK kinases or by binding the STAT proteins, thereby sequestering them in high molecular mass complexes or inducing their proteasomal degradation (Andrejeva et al. 2002; Garcin et al. 2002; Gotoh et al. 2003; Nanda and Baron 2006; Palosaari et al. 2003; Parisien et al. 2001; Park et al. 2003; Rodriguez et al. 2003; Shaw et al. 2004 Shaw et al. , 2005 Takeuchi et al. 2001; Ulane et al. 2003; Yokota et al. 2003) . The P protein of rabies virus (a rhabdovirus) binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 and retains the activated transcription factors in the cytoplasm, thereby preventing STAT-dependent expression of IFN-regulated genes . Interestingly, the paramyxoviral V protein as well as the rabies virus P protein have a dual anti-IFN function: they block both IFN induction (see above) and STAT signaling. Ebola virus, by contrast, uses a different protein, VP24, to block nuclear import of STAT by interacting with the transporter protein karyopherin alpha1 (Reid et al. 2006) . STAT signaling is also disturbed by viruses causing persistent infections, such as HCV (Fran\u00e7ois et al. 2000; Heim et al. 1999 ), herpes simplex virus (HSV) (Chee and Roizman 2004; Yokota et al. 2004 ), HHV-8 (Fuld et al. 2006) , or cytomegalovirus (Khan et al. 2004; Zimmermann et al. 2005) .",

            "text": "To date, the best studied antiviral pathways are the protein kinase R (PKR) system Williams 1999) , the 2-5 OAS/RNaseL system (Silverman 1994) , and the Mx system (Haller and Kochs 2002) . Their importance for host survival following viral infections has been amply demonstrated (Arnheiter et al. 1996; Hefti et al. 1999; Zhou et al. 1999) . Additional proteins with known antiviral activities are P56 (Guo et al. 2000; Hui et al. 2003) , ISG20 (Espert et al. 2003) , promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) (Regad et al. 2001 ), guanylatebinding protein 1 (GBP-1) (Anderson et al. 1999) , and RNA-specific adenosine deaminase 1 (ADAR1) (Samuel 2001) . Mx protein expression is tightly controlled by type I IFNs, making Mx gene expression a useful marker for IFN action in clinical settings (Antonelli et al. 1999; Roers et al. 1994) . In contrast, PKR and 2-5 OAS are constitutively expressed in a latent, inactive form in normal cells. Their expression is transcriptionally upregulated in IFN-treated cells. Importantly, these two enzymes need to be activated by viral dsRNA. This requirement makes them vulnerable to IFN antagonists found in many viruses. Indeed, viruses endowed with the capacity to sequester dsRNA by virtue of viral RNA-binding proteins are capable of preventing activation of PKR or the 2-5 OAS/RNaseL system (Antonelli et al. 1999; Roers et al. 1994; Weber et al. 2004 ). An alternative strategy used by several viruses is to encode small RNAs that compete with dsRNA for binding to PKR, thereby preventing activation. This is the case for adenoviruses (Mathews and Shenk 1991) , HCV (Vyas et al. 2003) , Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (Elia et al. 1996) , and HIV-1 (Gunnery et al. 1990 ). Some viruses express proteins that either directly bind to or otherwise inactivate PKR. For example, the \u03b334.5 protein of HSV-1 triggers the dephosphorylation of eIF-2\u03b1, thus reverting the translational block established by PKR (He et al. 1997) . The E2 protein of HCV acts as pseudosubstrate for PKR (Taylor et al. 1999) , as does the Tat protein of HIV-1 (Roy et al. 1990) or the K3L protein of vaccinia virus (Davies et al. 1992) . Interestingly, FLUAV exploits a cellular pathway to block PKR in that it activates p58 IPK , a cellular inhibitor of PKR (Lee et al. 1990 ) and NS1 to block the 2-5 OAS/RNaseL system (Li et al. 2006; Min and Krug 2006) . Poliovirus induces the degradation of PKR (Black et al. 1993) . Many viruses also block the RNaseL pathway, either by expressing dsRNA-binding proteins (see above), or by other, more direct means. Encephalomyocarditis virus as well as HIV-1 induce the synthesis of RLI, a cellular RNaseL inhibitor (Martinand et al. 1998 (Martinand et al. , 1999 . Infection with HSV-1 and HSV-2 activates the synthesis of 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate derivatives, which bind and prevent RNaseL activation (Cayley et al. 1984) . The antiviral effect of IFN is inhibited in cells infected with RSV (Atreya and Kulkarni 1999; Young et al. 2000) , an effect most probably mediated by the viral NS1 and the NS2 proteins (Schlender et al. 2000; Spann et al. 2004; Wright et al. 2006) .",

Similar disruptions of ND10 were observed in cells infected with CMV, EBV, HPV, and adenoviruses (Muller and Dejean 1999) .

            "text": "When considering the IFN-inducing and -suppressing activities of infecting viruses, it is important to keep in mind that the IFN response is generated in a cascade-like manner. As shown in Fig. 3 , viral replication and genome amplification leads to accumulation of viral nucleic acids and other components that are sensed as danger signals or PAMPs. They activate the IFN induction pathway (left part of Fig. 3 ) via cellular sensors (RIG-I, MDA-5), adaptors (IPS-1/ MAVS), protein kinases (TBK-1, IKK-\u03b5), and transcription factors of the IFN regulatory factor (IRF) family (Honda and Taniguchi 2006) . IFN gene expression depends on the basic cellular transcription machinery composed of the cellular RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and essential co-factors, such as components of the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH). Secreted IFNs bind to their cognate receptors and activate the JAK-STAT signaling pathway (right part of Fig. 3) , which induces the antiviral effector molecules. Most components of the IFN induction and signaling pathways are themselves IFN-inducible, representing a positive amplification loop. During viral replication, however, a number of viral IFN antagonists are produced (center part of Fig. 3) and interfere with the IFN response circuit. It is not unusual that a given virus displays more than one IFN-antagonistic protein and targets different parts of the IFN response pathway. Also, a single viral protein may inhibit quite different components of the IFN induction and signaling cascade. Thus, viral dsRNA-binding proteins have the advantage of blocking both IFN production and action. Besides, the dsRNA-binding NS1 protein of influenza A virus has additional functions and impairs also the post-transcriptional processing and nuclear export of cellular pre-mRNAs (Chen et al. 1999; Fortes et al. 1994; Kim et al. 2002; Li et al. 2001; Noah et al. 2003) . Since the IFN response is generated in a cascade-like manner, viral proteins blocking one component in this circuit also affect distant signaling or effector molecules, thereby amplifying the inhibitory effect. For example, JAK-STAT inhibitors suppress not only the production of antiviral proteins, but also the expression of RIG-I, MDA-5, IPS-1/MAVS, and IRFs, which are all IFN-inducible proteins. As a consequence, a negative amplification loop is produced, which further helps the virus to suppress the IFN system as a whole. ",

            "text": "Viruses are able to negatively influence the whole spectrum of the IFN response, often affecting different parts of the IFN circuit at the same time. The interplay between viruses and the IFN system, as described here, most likely results from an evolutionary race between the two genetic systems. The race is ongoing, as emerging viruses attempt transmission across species to new hosts. This is best illustrated by recent outbreaks of SARS coronavirus or the constant threat of avian influenza A viruses to invade the human population. Our present knowledge of the IFN system and viral countermeasures is still limited. Future research should provide better insight into the intricate interplay between viruses and the innate immune defenses of the host. This knowledge is important not only for a better understanding of viral pathogenesis, but also for designing novel vaccination strategies and therapeutic approaches.",
