            "text": "Fibropapillomatosis is a neoplastic disease in sea turtles characterized by cutaneous tumours, that is known to infect all sea turtle species across their global distribution (Ene et al., 2005, Herbst et al., 2004). Although multiple hypotheses have been proposed behind the causative agent of fibropapillomatosis, including chemical carcinogens, ultraviolet light, oncogenic viruses and metazoan parasites (Smith and Coates, 1938, Herbst and Klein, 1995, Casey et al., 1997, Herbst et al., 1998, Herbst et al., 1999, Greenblatt et al., 2004), that accepted most widely is the Chelonid fibropapilloma-associated herpesvirus (CFPHV) (Herbst, 1994, Work et al., 2009). Previous studies have detected the presence of CFPHV DNA in fibropapilloma tumour biopsies, and viral DNA sequences were also recovered recently from normal tissue from fibropapillomatosis exhibiting animals (Ene et al., 2005, Page-Karjian et al., 2012). The detection of CFPHV in tumour biopsies is not surprising \u2013 herpesviruses are known to replicate in tumours and tissue of debilitated animals (Herbst et al., 1995), thus large concentrations of viral DNA are present. In contrast however, when herpesviruses are present as latent infections \u2013 that is in individuals that do not exhibit clinical evidence of disease, the level of viral DNA in the tissues will be much lower, thus representing a detection challenge for methods used to assay for the virus\u2019 presence and prevalence.",

Singleplex PCR assays targeting relatively short amplicons (short-range PCR) are among those used most commonly, and have been reported to be more sensitive for viral detection than real-time PCR assays, for example as proven in detecting white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) (Mrotzek et al., 2010), infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV) (Katzourakis and Gifford, 2010) and monodon baculovirus (MBV) in shrimp (Mrotzek et al., 2010); porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV); transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PCRV) and pseudorabies virus (PRV) in pigs (Braun and Chase, 1999, Minarovits et al., 2006, Chentoufi et al., 2011) and various human papillomaviruses (Kleter et al., 1998, Morshed et al., 2008). In addition to conventional PCR, nested PCR assays have also been employed, following results suggest that they may increase detection sensitivity by 10,000-fold (Fox et al., 1995, Klein et al., 1998, Lu et al., 2000, Lu et al., 2003, Quackenbush et al., 2001).",

These samples represent both active (FP tumour) and latent (non-tumour) CFPHV infections. Non-tumour samples are defined as any other type of tissue with macroscopic absence of tumour and taken from either fibropapillomatosis exhibiting or clinically healthy not exhibiting turtles. A published previously (VanDevanter et al., 1996, Lu et al., 2000) nested approach, hereafter referred to as Lu.et.UL30, that was designed to target the CFPHV polymerase (pol) gene UL30, was used as baseline control against which new approaches were compared as described in Table 1\n. It can be challenging to PCR amplify targets within latent viral infections that exhibit potentially sequence variation at primer binding sites, and/or are present at low copy numbers. Two new detection assays, one based around singleplex PCR, the other around nested PCR were designed. Both involve three independent PCR assays that utilize primer sets that bind to highly conserved regions for three different genes in the CFPHV genome (Glycoprotein B gene UL27, Glycoprotein H gene UL22 and Mayor capsid protein gene UL18-UL19) to maximize chance of detection (Table 1). Primers were designed using the software Primer3 (v.0.4.0) implemented in Geneious Pro 7.0.6 (Biomatters, New Zealand).",

Among the individual singleplex assays UL22 yielded positive results for 70.5% of the samples, UL27 for 57.6% and UL18 for 43.9% (Table 2). All singleplex primer sets outperform nested PCR assays, with nested UL22 being the highest in viral detection (28%). Moreover, there were only three positive viral samples that were detected uniquely positive by only one nested and singleplex primer sets. All other nested positive detections were confirmed simultaneously by at least two of the singleplex primers (Table S1).",

The control nested assay was implemented following the conditions described by Lu et al. (2000), who applied originally this to a Hawaiian green turtle fibropapillomatosis test population. Subsequently it has been applied for detection of CFPHV in greens and loggerheads turtles from Florida (Klein et al., 1998) and in two green turtle populations in Puerto Rico (Page-Karjian et al., 2012), with success rates that were higher over a mixture of tumour and non-tumour samples than reported here. The dataset presented in this study was derived from tumour and non-tumour samples from fibropapillomatosis exhibiting green turtles, and healthy turtles (thus not fibropapillomatosis exhibiting) from five turtle species worldwide creating a bigger challenge for the detection method applied (supplementary Table S1). The variety of tissue material used for the DNA extracts may explain the difference in detection when using control-nested assay Lu.et.UL30 with comparing other studies.",

The potential role of viral concentration in PCR success is obvious. That of DNA fragment sizes is relevant for nested PCR, due to relatively larger size of the primary amplicon in relation to that of singleplex amplicons. Thus under any condition where DNA is degraded, the singleplex reactions will perform better.",
