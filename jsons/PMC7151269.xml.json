These are patients with significant mandibular and facial fractures and serious space occupying infections. It is important that these patients are treated rapidly with full barrier protection, and after-care minimised.2)Nonoperative patients - there are a number of conditions that can be managed either operatively or non-operatively. An example would be fractures of the mandibular condyle. We must consider ways of increasing the percentage of nonoperative cases.3)day cases - more efficient, implemented as standard of care wherever possible.\n",
