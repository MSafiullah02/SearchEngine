Detailed knowledge of the molecular biology of the infection is indispensable for understanding of the viral replication, host responses, and disease progression. We provide gene expression profiles of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections in three human cell lines (H1299, Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells), using bulk and single-cell transcriptomics. Small RNA profiling showed strong expression of the immunity and inflammation-associated microRNA miRNA-155 upon infection with both viruses. SARS-CoV-2 elicited approximately two-fold higher stimulation of the interferon response compared to SARS-CoV in the permissive human epithelial cell line Calu-3, and induction of cytokines such as CXCL10 or IL6. Single cell RNA sequencing data showed that canonical interferon stimulated genes such as IFIT2 or OAS2 were broadly induced, whereas interferon beta (IFNB1) and lambda (IFNL1-4) were expressed only in a subset of infected cells. In addition, temporal resolution of transcriptional responses suggested interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) activities precede that of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB). Lastly, we identified heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) as a protein relevant for the infection. Inhibition of the HSP90 charperone activity by Tanespimycin/17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) resulted in a reduction of viral replication, and of TNF and IL1B mRNA levels. In summary, our study established in vitro cell culture models to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and identified HSP90 protein as potential drug target for therapeutic intervention of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

            "text": "Diseases caused by coronaviruses (CoVs) range from asymptomatic and mild infections of the upper respiratory tract to severe acute respiratory distress, when the lower respiratory tract is infected. In addition to the six previously-known CoVs affecting humans, a novel CoV termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently emerged. The novel SARS-CoV-2, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 , is still an ongoing global health threat since the beginning of the outbreak in late 2019 and has, at the time of writing this text, infected more than three million people worldwide [1] . The SARS-CoV-2 life cycle initiates with the attachment of the virion to the cell surface and subsequent binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), followed by proteolytic cleavage and internalization [2] [3] [4] . Non-structural proteins are then translated to form a replicasetranscriptase complex (RTC), in which the full genomic RNA, as well as subgenomic RNAs are generated within double membrane vesicles (DMV) [3] [4] [5] . Incoming viral RNA is detected by sensors such as IFIH1 (interferon induced with helicase C domain 1; also known as MDA5) and DDX58 (DExD/H-Box helicase 58; also known as RIG-I), which trigger the antiviral response. This sensing and signaling is impaired by a range of viral factors, e.g. replication within DMVs, RNA capping and methylation, or shortening of the poly-U tail on the minus strand RNA [6, 7] . Furthermore, inhibition of IRF activity [8] and a delayed induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) compared to Influenza virus infection or type I interferon treatment itself [9] was observed in SARS-CoV infection. Importantly, accessory genes in the SARS-CoV genome, like ORF6, may code for antagonists of interferon signaling [10] .",

The substantial increase in ER translation causes ER stress, which triggers the unfolded protein response. This is then in turn integrated with double stranded RNA sensing at the level of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2alpha) phosphorylation [14] . The ER stress response is likely attenuated by the viral E protein [15, 16] . Accordingly, heat shock proteins (HSPs), which ameliorate ER stress, have been described to be generally relevant in virus infections [17] . Furthermore, ER stress induces autophagy, a cell recycling pathway which can be used by some viruses for productive replication [18] . Finally, dysregulation of microRNA (miRNA) expression and subsequent alterations in gene expression patterns have also been reported to play a role in infected cells [19, 20] .",

The scRNA-seq data showed that, while canonical ISGs such as interferon induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 and 2 (IFIT1/IFIT2) were broadly induced, interferon beta (IFNB1) was expressed only in a subset of infected cells. Furthermore, the transcriptional induction of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) targets could be temporally separated from the interferon gene induction.

We observed a consistent hierarchy of gene expression across time, mostly dominated by viral mRNAs encoding the M gene (Fig. 1D, Fig.   S1D ), similar to a recent report for the alpha Human CoV-229E (HCoV-229E) [35] . At later time points post infection, the relative amount of ORF7a generally increased ( Figure S1E ).",

In contrast, Calu-3 cells showed a strong increase in expression of ISGs such as the IFIT1, IFIT2, and interferon genes. This response was absent in Caco-2 cells likely due to the reduced expression of pattern-recognition receptors, IFIH1 and DDX58 that activate transcription of target genes via interferon regulatory factors (IRF) and NF-\u03baB signaling [36, 37] , which supports similar results for SARS-CoV infection [38] (Supplementary data 1).",

This difference in the extent of the ISG response may be of clinical relevance, since cytokines [39] are among the induced ISGs (Fig. S2B) , and their expression might be connected with pathologies such as the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in CoV infections [40, 41] .",

Likewise, MIR155HG, though poorly detected, resembled the expression pattern of IFIT1 and IFIT2 genes (compare Fig. S4I with 4B, and S4J with 4C/S4H). In order to identify genes co-regulated with IFNB1, we performed a correlation analysis of cells binned by increasing IFNB1 and ARRDC3 expression level (Fig. S4L ). Using this approach we found a putative co-regulation of the four interferon lambda genes (IFNL1-4), the chemokine genes, C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 9 (CXCL9) and C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 5 (CCL5), and the cholesterol-25-hydroxylase gene, CH25H. This enzyme, as well as its product 25-hydroxycholesterol, have been shown to act against a range of viruses [53] . In addition, two other genes were found in this group, the sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 3 gene (SCN3A) and the dual oxidase 1 gene (DUOX1) (Fig. S4M) , which are poorly expressed in cells outside cluster 13. Whereas SCN3A has previously not been described in the context of virus infections, DUOX1 promotes the innate immune defense to pathogens via the production of reactive oxygen species in mucosae [54] .",

For various CoVs, a range of mechanisms that interfere with interferon signaling has been reported [60] . For SARS-CoV, it was shown that ORF6 inhibits signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling [61] and that IRF3 activity is impaired [8] . Since RNA levels per cell (Fig. S4) and on the population level were comparable ( Fig. 1) , it is tempting to speculate that such mechanisms could be less efficient in SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV. Indeed, cytokine production was described to be connected to pathogenesis [21, 40, 41] . However, the extent to which observations in cell lines and other models are reproducible in animal models and humans will require further investigations [62] [63] [64] .",

In addition, mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL1B, which are implied in the progression of COVID-19 [85] , were strongly reduced. Since 17-AAG can induce apoptosis in cancer cells, which was not observed here for Calu-3 cells, the inhibitory effect of 17-AAG on viral replication needs to be expanded to studies in primary tissue infection models. Since several inhibitors of HSP90 with higher affinities have been in clinical development as anticancer agents [86] and advanced to phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, some of these compounds could be readily available to become part of a therapeutic strategy for COVID-19.

Viral genes were quantified by taking the top eight noncanonical splice events called by STAR across all total RNA-seq datasets according to the numbers of uniquely-mapping reads spanning the junction (Supplemental Table 3 ). To estimate levels of ORF1ab, insertions, soft-clipping events and split reads were filtered from virus-mapping reads, followed by intersection with positions 53-83 of the virus using bedtools, requiring a minimum of 24 nucleotides overlap to reflect the parameters STAR requires to call a noncanonical splice junction [92] . These counts were either combined with a count matrix of the human genes quantified by STAR and TMM/CPM normalized with edgeR ( Figure S1D ) or normalized by the total number of viral junctionspanning reads per time point ( Figure S1E ) [93] .

The percentages of viral transcripts in intracellular RNAs as determined by Poly(A) +and RNA-seq sequencing were low in H1299 cells for both viruses in contrast to Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells(Fig. 1C, Supplementary Table 2). Accordingly, the yield of infectious virus particles was higher for the permissive cell lines Caco-2 and Calu-3(Fig. S1A). The low susceptibility of H1299 cells might be attributed, at least partially, to the low expression of the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2, based on RNA-sequencing data and Western blot analysis(Fig. 1B).",

At 4 hpi, the number of cells bearing viral RNA was between 40% and 60% (Fig. S4A, supplementary table S4). At 8 hpi and 12 hpi, all cells contained viral RNA.

For selected genes, the expression level per bin was plotted against the amount of viral RNA (Fig. 5E). For IFIT2, this result indicated an likely off-on switch between 4 hpi and 8 hpi, with the expression levels being independent of the amount of viral RNA. For ARRDC3 however, the mRNA transcript numbers correlated well with the accumulation of viral RNA (R2 = 0.77). For the interferon beta gene IFNB1, acertain amount of viral RNA appeared to be a prerequisite for the IFNB1 mRNA levels, however beyond that threshold per-bin expression levels were rather variable. For SARS-CoV, the IFIT2 switch could not be observed, and the accumulation of ARRDC3 mRNA started only at higher levels of viral RNA(Fig. 4E).",

This analysis showed a trajectory from cells expressing interferon and interferon-correlated genes to the cells with maximal amount of viral RNA but not expressing interferon genes(Fig. 5A, S5A, S5B). This finding suggests that induction of interferon genes is short and transient during viral replication. We observed that target genes of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) such as IFIT2, IFIT1 or OAS2[56] show high intron counts in an intermediate state during the accumulation of viral RNA(Fig. 5B, S5C), but this signal later decreases. At this time, however, NF-\u03baB target genes such as interleukin 6 (IL6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or NF-\u03baB inhibitor alpha (NFKBIA)[57] had still high intron counts(Fig. 5C, S5D). Taken together, this finding suggests that IRF-regulated genes are transcribed before NF-\u03baB target genes, with IRF activity ceasing late(Fig. 5D).Interestingly, we also observed a minor increase in intronic counts for ACE2 transcripts in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells(Fig. S5E, S5F), suggesting a transcriptional activation of the viral receptor gene during infection, as observed recently[58].Single-cell RNA-sequencing of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infected H1299 reveals a potential involvement of HSP90AA1 in the progression of infection As shown above, transcriptional changes in bulk and scRNA-seq data from Calu-3 infected cells were dominated by the interferon response. In order to detect more subtle alterations in the cellular transcriptomes, we applied the scRNA-seq likewise to SARS-CoV/-2 infected H1299 cells, which are only partially permissive to the infection.Despite the overall low amount of viral RNA in infected H1299 cells(Fig. 1C), the percentage of cells bearing viral transcripts was remarkably high(Fig. S6A, supplementary table S4), indicating that virions indeed are able to enter the cells. As seen in the bulk RNA-seq, transcriptional changes were subtle, and cells thus do not group into discrete clusters(Fig. S6B, S6C, S6D). When correlating individual genes with the amount of viral RNA over cells, we found a positive correlation with HSP90 alpha family class A member 1 (HSP90AA1) with the amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but not SARS-CoV(Fig. 6A). Upon closer inspection, we observed higher expression of HSP90AA1 mRNA and RNA velocity values in cells with SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA compared to those without(Fig. 6B). We thus went back to the Calu-3 data and found a similar HSP90AA1 expression pattern in Calu-3 cells harvested at 4 hpi (Fig. 6C-E).",

For the 8hpi experiment, also intracellular RNA was measured(Fig. 7B, bottom panel). At a concentration of 800 nM, 17-AAG reduced the viral yield to about 50%. In an additional experiment with similar outcomes(Fig. 7C, 7D), we assessed changes in host cell mRNA expression of infected cells to treatment with 17-AAG(Fig. 7E). Interestingly, whereas IFIT2 mRNA expression levels were only slightly reduced in cells treated with the inhibitor 17-AAG, reduction in mRNA levels for PPP1R15A and INFL1, and particularly for IL1B and TNF, were much more pronounced. This result could point to a complex regulation of these genes involving HSP90 activity. The treatment with 17-AAG had no apparent effect on cell viability and ISG induction was tested using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) of selected genes(Fig.",
