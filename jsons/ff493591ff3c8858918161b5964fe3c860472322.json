Many of the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological features of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia appeared similar to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS). The 2019-nCoV is more infectious than SARS. Timely treatment plans demand rapid elucidation and analysis of the virus pathology and phylogeny. Here we studied the 2019-nCoV phylogeny using IC-PIC alignment-free method which is based on DNA/RNA sequence information correlation (IC) and partial information correlation (PIC). Virus whole genome sequence was converted into two-dimensional numeric matrix. The Euclidean distance between matrices are used to evaluate the evolutionary distance between their respective genomes.

The family Coronaviridae contains 4 genera, namely Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus [3] . Six coronavirus species are known to cause human disease [4] . Among which HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are belong to the genus Betacoronavirus [5] [6] [7] [8] . The other two strains, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, are belong to the genus Alphacoronavirus [4, 5] . In the end of 2019, a pneumonia disease that caused by 2019-nCoV outbreaks in Wuhan, and the disease was assumed started from a local seafood market [9] . The outbreak has grown With the advent of BLAST based tools, alignment-based sequence analyses reveal many new discoveries [11] [12] [13] . Phylogenetic analysis of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein, spike proteins, and full-length genomes found that 2019-nCoV is most closely related to two bat SARS-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and bat-SL-CoVZC45, and the 2019-nCoV is thought to belong to Sarbecovirus of Betacoronavirus [14 -18] . From phylogenetic analysis of full genome alignment and similarity plots, it was found that 2019-nCoV has the highest similarity to the bat coronavirus RaTG13 sampled from a Rhinolophus affinis bat in Yunnan in 2013 [19, 20] . A recombination analysis performed revealed that bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and bat-SL-CoVZC45 are likely recombinants, containing genome segments from multiple SARS-CoV related lineages and 2019-nCoV related lineages including that from pangolins (Manis javanica) [21] . There is still ongoing debate whether the 2019-nCoV strain arose following recombination with previously identified bat and unknown coronaviruses [22] or arose independently as a new lineage to infect humans [19] . The alignment-based methods often give high accuracy and may reveal the relationships among sequences. However, alignment methods meet huge challenges when the recombination, shuffling, and rearrangement events frequently occur in the genome evolution. Simultaneously, the whole-genome multiple alignments are very time-consuming and expensive in memory usage [23] .",

The branching order of IC-PIC tree shows location-virus linkage. The picture also shows the details of how the disease spreads from one place to another. Thus the present phylogenetic tree may give a clue to searching for the origin of the outbreak in Wuhan. Furthermore, the mutation rate of viruses is an interesting problem. The rate calculation and prediction is closely related to the set of evolutionary clock. In our approach the evolutionary clock could be calibrated by evolutionary distance. It has been noted that coronavirus RdRp have high mutation rates during replication, and the mechanism which contribute to high rate of recombination is diversity [33 -36] .",

Pangolin cornoaviruses form a monophyletic clade sister to the clade of RaTG13 and 2019-nCoVs. Five SARS strains cluster together and nest into SARS-like-CoVs. However, Bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and bat-SL-CoVZC45 jump out of the clade of the SARS-like-CoVs. These two viruses are recognized as belonging to Sarbecovarus subgenus. From Fig 1 we found the 2019-nCoVs, RaTG13 and pangolin cornoaviruses get together with bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and bat-SL-CoVZC45, in agreement with phylogenetic analysis of full-length genome, RdRp gene and S gene sequences [20], and Chaos Game Representation analysis which is based on alignment-free method [30]. So, we conclude that 2019-nCoVs, RaTG13 and pangolin cornoaviruses belong to the subgenus of Sarbecovarus and support the assumption that the novel viruses are of bat origin with pangolin as one of the intermediate hosts and RaTG13 having played important role. However, from IC-PIC tree the evolution of 2019-nCoVs have to go through at least four mutations from the bat origin, namely, the formation of bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and bat-SL-CoVZC45, the bifurcation from these two viruses, the bifurcation from pangolin cornoaviruses and the bifurcation fromRaTG13. This is a rather long evolutionary path. Notably, in the IC-PIC tree Pangolin cornoaviruses form a monophyletic clade sister to the clade of RaTG13 and 2019-nCoVs , that is different from the phylogenetic tree obtained by Lam et al.[21]. Further, on the IC-PIC tree Hibecovirus and Nobecovirus form their own clade respectively and Embecovirus and Merbecovirus locate next to each other. Tree topology well agrees with alignment-based phylogenetic trees and is remarkably consistent with biologist's systematics.",

Moreover, the IC-PIC tree of 2019-nCoVs gives the details of disease spreading and provides a clue to searching for the origin of the outbreak in Wuhan.
