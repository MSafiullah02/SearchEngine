In tropical areas, the seasonal pattern of viral detection is more difficult to be analysed, due to the heterogeneity of data in several parts of the world. However, respiratory viruses have been mainly observed during the rainy seasons [14]. In southeast Brazil, a region of transition between tropical and subtropical climates, peaks of viral ARI tend to occur during cooler months [15], [16], [17]. The present paper reports analyses of over time variations in rates of detection of respiratory viruses in tissues and secretions removed from children undergoing tonsillectomy while in the absence of ARI symptoms. The rationale was that if detection of respiratory viruses in hypertrophic tonsillar tissues oscillated with variations in temperature and rainfall, in a way similar to what occurs among ARI patients, this would suggest an association with acute subclinical respiratory viral infections, rather than prolonged asymptomatic harbouring of viral nucleic acids in the tissues.",

The frequencies of HAdV, HBoV and HRSV were higher in adenoids, whereas HRV was more frequently detected in nasal secretions and HEV in palatine tonsils. The rates of viral co-infections and the agreement between results from different tissues were high. In this 2-year study period, two or more viruses were detected in 62.2% of the patients, and 54% of them had the same virus detected in adenoids and palatine tonsils.",

Detection frequencies of HAdV and HBoV were consistently higher in adenoids than in other samples. Rates of detection of the picornaviruses HRV and HEV were opposite in the summer, while the rate of HEV detection was at its peak, HRV was at its lowest (Fig. 4, Fig. 5\n). The overall HEV detection rates were composed mostly by results obtained from adenoids and palatine tonsils, while detection in respiratory secretions was found in a smaller proportion of the HEV-positive patients (Fig. 4). Although peaks of HEV detection occurred in summer/autumn months, the rates of HEV positivity were always above 30%, indicating that a great proportion of tonsil tissues harbour HEV, independently of the season of the year. Contrary to HEV, HRV overall rates showed no clear seasonal variations, and were mostly composed by results obtained from secretions, with correspondingly lower rates of positivity in tonsillar tissues (Fig. 5).",

In fact, HAdV causes persistent/latent infection in tonsillar T-cell subpopulations [29], and can infect continuous B-cell and myeloid cell lineages in vitro [30], suggesting that several different cell populations in tonsils may carry the virus genome. Therefore, it was no surprise that in the present study HAdV was the most frequent respiratory virus detected in adenoids, and the second most frequent in palatine tonsils. In addition, the lack of seasonal trends in rates of HAdV detection, both in tissues and secretions, is confirmatory that most of the high HAdV frequency is attributable to persistence. In tropical regions, adenovirus is frequently associated with the rainy season in patients with acute respiratory infections [19].",

Only around 25% of patients who are PCR-positive for HBoV have mRNA for a viral structural protein detectable as a marker of active viral replication [34] and HBoV episomes have been found in human clinical samples, including tissue biopsies [35], [36], [37].

In the present study, HEV was the second most frequently detected agent at overall frequencies consistently above 30%. Although there are very few studies about seasonality of HEV in tropical regions, the observed trend for an increase in HEV detection towards the summer is in keeping with what happens in temperate regions of the world [38]. However, the high rates of HEV positivity were consistently due to detection in tissue fragments, which was less frequently accompanied by shedding in secretions, supporting the idea that HEV can persist in adenoids and tonsils in a high proportion of patients. While confirmation of HEV persistence in tonsillar tissues will require detailed molecular investigation, the present findings of such consistently and non-seasonal HEV detection over time, coupled with the already reported higher frequencies of HEV detection in the most highly hypertrophic tonsils [3] indicates that perhaps HEV persistence can be associated with the pathogenesis of chronic adenotonsillar diseases.",

In tropical regions, the literature results are controversial. In Trinidad, West Indies, HRV was prevalent throughout the year, without seasonal association [41], whilst in Salvador HRV was associated with relative humidity (p\n = 0.05) [19]. In the present analysis HRV was frequently detected in all seasons, mostly in secretions, rather than in tissues. It is interesting that HRV and HEV are both picornaviruses, currently classified in the same genus, with very similar replication cycles, and yet showed dissimilar frequencies of detection in tissues. HRV was detected in lower frequencies in lymphoid tissues as compared to HEV, suggesting the existence of other sites of infection as sources of HRV shedding into secretions, such as nasal epithelium. This is remarkable, since the patients with hypertrophic adenotonsillar diseases had no acute nasal symptoms at the time of surgery.",

Moreover, HRSV rates were frequently higher than 10%, with significant contribution of positivity in adenotonsillar tissues, again suggesting that these tissues may be regarded as sites of persistence of paramyxoviruses. Pertaining to this issue, it is interesting that phylogenetic studies of respiratory syncytial virus have pointed to the existence of reservoirs to maintain the virus during inter-seasonal periods, thus creating potential for its reintroduction in the susceptible population [42]. It is therefore reasonable to think that adenoids and tonsils of children with chronic adenotonsillar diseases would be natural reservoirs of respiratory viruses and that, by shedding viruses in respiratory secretions, these children would become sources of infection for their siblings and schoolmates.",

Although further studies are in order to clarify whether these findings result from long term virus shedding consequent to persistence, or to current asymptomatic viral infections, the lack of obvious seasonal patterns of respiratory viruses in hypertrophic adenotonsillar tissues supports the view that some respiratory viruses may persist in adenoids and tonsils. In the absence of results from molecular markers of active viral replication, the mere detection of viral genomes is not enough to establish that such infections were productive. However, the existence of genomes of numerous viruses in adenotonsillar tissues is an exciting finding, and deserves further investigation. In addition to its obvious epidemiological importance as possible sources of community respiratory virus outbreaks, persistence of these viruses could have pathogenic potential in the development of tonsillar hypertrophy, functioning as chronic stimuli for inflammation. Alternatively, for reasons not yet understood, respiratory viruses could more readily establish an asymptomatic carrier states in patients with chronic tonsillar hypertrophy. However, the lack of control group, with samples of tonsils obtained from healthy patients, makes any inference about the development of disease difficult to be explored in the present study. Thereby, studies about viral persistence in adenoids and tonsils, mainly those including tissue samples from healthy subjects, can bring new insights to the understanding of poorly understood chronic tonsillar diseases that affect large numbers of children worldwide.",
