At least four isoforms of the \u03b1 subunit have been identified, and three isoforms of the \u00df subunit that all show tissue-specific distribution. The \u03b1 subunits host all functionally significant sites including ATP-binding and phosphorylation sites, the sites for interaction with the transported cations and for specific inhibitors like cardiotonic steroids, and the binding site for palytoxin (see Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-30012-2_7) .",

The \u00df subunit is necessary for proper folding of the \u03b1 subunit and for assembly and proper insertion of the entire protein into the cell membrane. The combination of an \u03b1 subunit with different \u00df subunits results in a different function and, therefore, a regulatory role of the \u00df subunit has been discussed. In addition, a \u03b3 subunit has been identified, which also seems to have a regulatory function. One option to monitor modulation of the ion transport is the measurement of a pump-mediated current under voltage clamp.",

Hence, inhibition of channel activity by drugs will counteract that process, allowing the infected body to build up or strengthen its own immune system. Viral ion channels are, therefore, potential candidates for developing new antiviral drugs, and voltage clamping is an easy method to screen drugs, and detect and analyze inhibition of the ion channels. Screening of a large number of natural drugs revealed that kaempferol derivatives and anthraquinones may be interesting candidates.",
