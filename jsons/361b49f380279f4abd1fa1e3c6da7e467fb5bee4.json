We recommend that poor oral hygiene be considered a risk to COVID-19 complications, particularly in patients predisposed to altered biofilms due to diabetes, hypertension or cardiovascular disease. Bacteria present in patients with severe COVID-19 are associated with the oral cavity, and improved oral hygiene may reduce the risk of complications. Whilst COVID-19 has a viral origin, it is suspected that in severe forms of the infection, bacteria plays a part, increasing the chance of complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death. 1 The development and severity of complications following a COVID-19 infection depend on numerous host and viral factors that will affect a patient's immune response. Whilst 80% of patients with COVID-19 infections have mild symptoms, 20% progress to have a severe form of infection associated with higher levels of inflammatory markers (Interleukin 2, 6, 10) and bacteria. 2,3 They also exhibit a remarkably higher neutrophil count and lower lymphocyte count than in mild patients. 4 A high neutrophil count is abnormal for a viral infection, but common for a bacterial infection, suggesting that in severe cases of COVID-19, bacterial superinfection is common.",
