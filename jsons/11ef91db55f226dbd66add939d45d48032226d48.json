It is especially important to monitor for such adverse effects during the potential use of hydroxychloroquine for treatment or prophylaxis in patients with a COVID-19 infection. Abstract: Background: While evidence suggests that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) may decrease the viral load in patients with a COVID-19 infection, a number of case reports indicate adverse dermatologic effects of this potential treatment. Objective: To conduct a systematic review of previously reported cases of psoriasis onset, exacerbation, or relapse after HCQ treatment. Methods: A comprehensive EMBASE and MEDLINE search of original studies examining adverse effects of HCQ treatment related to psoriasis was conducted. Participant demographics, and details of HCQ administration and psoriasis diagnosis were extracted from 15 articles representing 18 patients.",

Such discovery prompted recent investigations for the potential use of this drug to treat patients with COVID-19, a novel infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) initially reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019 6 and resulting in over 200,000 deaths worldwide by April, 2020. 7 Recent open-labeled, nonrandomized clinical trials showed that HCQ may decrease viral load and may improve outcomes in a small number of patients with COVID-19. [8] [9] [10] [11] Despite the lack of strong evidence, rapid spread of COVID-19 led the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve emergency use of HCQ in hospitalized patients that do not have alternative treatment options. 12 However, the efficacy and safety profile of this drug are yet to be reported in ongoing randomized controlled trials. 13 A number of case reports indicate adverse dermatologic effects of HCQ treatment, such as new onset or exacerbation of psoriasis. Most recently, a 71-year-old patient with COVID-19 was reported to have an exacerbation of pre-existing psoriasis with silvery-scaled psoriatic plaques after 4 days of HCQ treatment. 14 As the incidence of COVID-19 infections increase, it is important for healthcare providers to recognize and manage the relevant adverse effects associated with potential HCQ treatment.",

This may be due to the inhibiting effect HCQ has on epidermal transglutaminase activity, which leads to an initial break in the epidermal barrier. The resulting epidermal proliferation aimed at barrier restoration may lead to the induction or worsening of psoriasis. 31 In addition, HCQ may promote the production of IL-17 via p38-dependant IL-23 release, resulting in increased keratinocyte growth. 32 Furthermore, they may interfere with cholesterol metabolism process, which is crucial for the structural and functional integrity of the stratum corneum. 33 Lastly, patients identified in this study were predominantly females (77.8%, n=14). Given that autoimmune diseases are more prevalent in females, role of sex hormones may be suggested. 34 There are several limitations to our systematic review that must be considered. Firstly, all summarized studies are case reports and case series. As a result, the lack of larger trials and observational nature of the studies limits the scope of analysis and generalizability of our findings to all patients using HCQ treatment. Additionally, it is difficult to attribute the development of psoriasis to HCQ use alone, as autoimmune comorbidities such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus may predispose individuals to psoriasis due to dysregulation of common cytokines. [17] [18] It is important to note that 92.3% of the studied patients had comorbid conditions, with the autoimmune disorders rheumatoid arthritis (33.3%) and systemic lupus erythematosus (25.0%) being the two most significant.",

            "text": "As a result, it may be difficult to attribute causality between psoriatic development or exacerbation and HCQ use alone, as these autoimmune comorbidities may predispose individuals to psoriasis due to dysregulation of common cytokines such as Il-17 and IL-23. 35, 36 Furthermore, 33.3% of cases (n=6) reported in this systematic review were also taking oral steroids. Of these 6 cases, 2 developed de-novo erythrodermic psoriasis and pustular psoriasis respectively, and 1 experienced a relapse of pustular psoriasis. Given that oral steroids have been reported to induce or precipitate erythrodermic and pustular psoriasis, HCQ may not have been solely responsible for the induction or relapse of psoriasis in these cases. 37, 38 In addition to the known side-effects of HCQ, such as QT prolongation, conduction abnormalities and restrictive or dilated cardiomyopathy, 39, 40 it is also essential to understand the impact of HCQ on exacerbation, relapse or new onset of psoriatic lesions. Although no robust peer-reviewed evidence exits at this time, a recent news article reported a higher mortality rate (27.8%) among COVID-19 patients who were administered HCQ compared to those who were not (11.4%). 41 This article brought attention to the significance of awaiting further evidence prior to extensive promotion and acceptance of this drug. Additional studies examining the safety profile of HCQ, especially in patients with psoriasis are desperately needed, before its potential use for COVID-19 infection. Given the lack of rigorous evidence available, further studies with larger sample sizes are required to confirm the findings reported in this systematic review. Many randomized trials are actively recruiting participants to determine the safety profile of HCQ treatment in COVID-19 patients. [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] The results from these studies will be key to determining if HCQ treatment is significantly associated with exacerbation, relapse or new onset of psoriasis. ",
