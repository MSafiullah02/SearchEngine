A diversity of ecological niches exist in the human body which can support a polymicrobial community, with the exact VOC profile of a given anatomical site being dependent on that produced by both the host component and the microbial species present. The detection of VOCs is of interest to various disciplines, hence numerous analytical approaches have been developed to accurately characterize and measure VOCs in the laboratory, often from patient derived samples. Using these technological advancements it is evident that VOCs are indicative of both health and disease states.

In the majority of cases, the largest amounts of carbon-energy are in the form of cell-impermeable polymers which require hydrolytic depolymerization before they can cross the cytoplasmic membrane, and enter into the cell (via specific transporter molecules). Figure 1 shows the main groups of macromolecules that are targeted within a host organism; polysaccharides (glycogen), proteins (e.g. collagen, albumin, globulin serum proteins, and haemoglobin), glycoproteins (mucins), lipids, phospholipids and nucleic acids. These compounds act as substrates for microbial growth via specific hydrolysis pathways (shown in figure 1) particularly during tissue infections, for example within wounds or periodontal disease (Harrington 1996) . The breakdown of polymeric substrates is therefore dependent on the microflora having the right mix of hydrolytic (digesting) enzymes, and these are classified by the reactions they Webb 1992) . The majority of the microbial hydrolytic enzymes are thought to be extracellular, hence their activity is likely to benefit all species present within a microcosm. An important group of molecules in tissues and wounds are the glycosaminoglycans (mucopolysaccharides) including hyaluronic acid, chondroitin-4 and chondroitin-6, heparin and dermatan-sulfate (Wadstr\u00f6m and Ljungh 1999) . The microbial enzymes that attack these substrates are classified as hyaluronate lyases (EC 4.2.2.1; see table 1), since this is not a hydrolysis reaction, but instead involves breakage of carbon-oxygen bonds. A number of important microbial pathogens possess hyaluronate lyase (considered a 'spreading factor') including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes (Makris et al 2004) .

Putrefaction is known to occur when heterotrophic microorganisms (bacteria, fungi and yeast) utilize organic material from once-living tissues (plants and animals, or their products, such as milk or sewage) as a source of carbon-energy. This 'feedstock' has high nutritional value and the presence of easily utilizable polymeric carbohydrates, lipids, nucleic acids, fats, and proteins. Microbes breakdown these compounds using various hydrolytic enzymes (see figure 1 and table 1) and resultant products are utilized by heterotrophic species as both a source of building blocks for the synthesis of their own structural polymers (anabolism), but most frequently by the main route of catabolism, as a source of biochemical energy (NADH and ATP) obtained either from aerobic respiration (O 2 ), anaerobic respiration (using endterminal electron acceptors such as NO 3 \u2212 or SO 4 2\u2212 in place of oxygen), or fermentation. Depending on the nature of the microbes and the local physicochemical conditions (i.e. types of organic matter, pH, salt concentration and temperature) the putrefaction process will produce VOC gases, including many that are odiferous. This includes ammonia, volatile sulfur compounds (VSC), indole and certain volatile amines, (including putrescine and cadaverine; Statheropoulos et al 2005) , all products of amino acid utilization for catabolism. The amino acids and small peptides are supplied from proteins following hydrolysis and digestion by proteolytic enzymes. Therefore, microbial processes will ultimately produce a complex mixture of VOCs and/or odour depending on both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including the composition and pH of 'feedstock'. For example, carbohydrates do not result in major VOC odours whilst proteins and/or fats result in a variety of foul putrefactive odours (Statheropoulos et al 2005) . In addition, a low pH (<6.0) is thought to allow yeasts and moulds to dominate, whilst a higher pH favours bacteria and the putrefaction processes, which will release foul-smelling VOCs (Mackie 1995) , including volatile sulfide compounds (VSC), indoles and amines.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1417, "end": 1443, "text": "Statheropoulos et al 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 1953, "end": 1980, "text": "(Statheropoulos et al 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 2169, "end": 2182, "text": "(Mackie 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 593, "end": 601, "text": "figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Putrefaction"}, {"text": "In general, when complex organic compound mixtures (including those within host organisms) are exposed to complex, highly diverse mixed cultures of microorganisms, then a well described theoretical sequence of ecological shifts (succession) and corresponding metabolic 'phases' or stages occur. Aerobes and facultative anaerobes are the first colonizers, with high growth rate and population expansion, giving accelerated reduction of the oxygen concentration and redox. Mixed culture fermentation produces carboxylic acids that may lower the pH enabling aciduric and acidophilic species to gain a selective advantage (e.g. Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Propionibacterium spp.; Wilson 2005) . When all small molecular weight, easy to assimilate sugars and amino acids have been fully utilized, hydrolytic mechanisms become induced or relieved of catabolite repression (Magasanik 1961 ) and microbial biotransformation of polymeric molecules (proteins and glycoproteins) becomes of more marked importance. The general phenomena of catabolite repression (Magasanik 1961) occurs when there is an abundance of small molecular weight (cell-transportable) nutrients (e.g. sugars or amino acids), and is a mechanism by which cells may conserve their energy (e.g. ATP) and amino-acid building blocks by repressing synthesis of enzymes involved in hydrolytic depolymerization of large molecules outside the cell. The enzymes are thus redundant under small molecule replete nutrient conditions.

Physicochemical conditions now favour anaerobic proteolytic species, especially strict anaerobes (e.g. Clostridium spp.). Volatile short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) will be produced through primary fermentation, producing mainly lactate, acetate, propionate and ethanol from the main carbohydrates, but is ultimately replaced by secondary fermentation, producing e.g. n-butyrate, propionate, propanol, n-butanol, and n-hexanol (Mackie 1995) . The volatile SCFAs propionate and n-butyrate are produced by Propionibacterium spp. and Butyribacterium spp. respectively, as end-products of central metabolism of sugars, and additional amounts are produced by fermentation of amino acids by species such as Clostridium and Fusobacterium (MacFarlane and MacFarlane 1995). If methanogens are present (e.g. within the gastrointestinal tract) and the hydrogen partial pressure becomes sufficiently high, then acetate will be converted to methane (Jones et al 1987) .

However, the human microflora is exposed to a variety of physicochemical environments at different anatomical locations, resulting in diverse but often restricted microbial ecology. For example, the diversity of species found in the large intestine of man and mammals is a strongly selected group that can withstand bile secretion and other physicochemical conditions of the gut (Wilson 2005) . Skin presents a hostile environment because of its low water activity, salt content, pH, and host defence molecules, but for those strains able to tolerate these conditions easily available nutrients are present, including sweat and sebum (Roth and James 1988) .

Trimethylamine is produced by many species of bacteria from the breakdown of choline or trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) found in meat, eggs, fish and certain vegetables (Brassica) (Groninger 1959 , Yamada 1967 . In fish (post mortem), TMAO is reduced by bacteria (notably Gram-negative rods) to trimethylamine (TMA), which gives rise to the characteristic off-flavour and odour of marine fish in the early stage of decay (Beatty and Gibbons 1937, Tarr 1954) . In humans, TMA is produced from TMAO (in the diet) or from choline, by intestinal bacteria. From the gut, TMA is then absorbed into the bloodstream and is oxidized into odourless TMAO by the liver enzyme flavin mono-oxygenase 3 (FMO 3 ) and excreted into urine. Trimethylaminuria (TMAU; fish odour syndrome) is a rare condition caused as a consequence of an autosomal recessive mutation in FMO 3 , where TMA is excreted into body fluids (including saliva and sweat) and is detected on breath giving rise to persistent or sporadic oral and body malodour (Mackay et al 2011 , Whittle et al 2007 .

In strongly neutral buffered environments, the amount of ammonium ion production is probably not high enough to affect large pH changes. However, additional ammonium ion can be produced from the action of microbial urease enzymes on the substrate urea (found in blood, sweat, saliva and other body fluids in addition to urine), producing ammonium and bicarbonate ions (Mobley and Hausinger 1989) .

There are two different mechanisms by which microbes produce hydrogen sulfide. One group of microbial species, collectively known as dissimilatory sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), reduce oxyanions of sulfer (SO 4 , SO 3 , S 2 O 3 2\u2212 ) as terminal electron acceptors, using cytochromes to perform 'anaerobic respiration' (Postgate 1984) .

The PLP molecule forms an aldimine bond with a lysine residue (Ku et al 2006) and catalyzes the reversible hydrolytic cleavage of L-tryptophan to produce indole and ammonium pyruvate via an \u03b1,\u03b2-elimination mechanism (Snell 1975) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 110, "end": 133, "text": "(Newton and Snell 1964)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 204, "end": 223, "text": "(Martin et al 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 251, "end": 275, "text": "(Yoshida et al 2009) and", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 276, "end": 309, "text": "F. nucleatum (Imamura et al 2010)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 493, "end": 515, "text": "Newton and Snell 1964)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 638, "end": 658, "text": "(Tso and Adler 1974)", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 893, "end": 915, "text": "(Newton and Snell 1964", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 916, "end": 936, "text": ", Martino et al 2003", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 937, "end": 957, "text": ", Mueller et al 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1074, "end": 1091, "text": "(Wang et al 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF131"}, {"start": 1166, "end": 1186, "text": "(Mueller et al 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1361, "end": 1376, "text": "(Ku et al 2006)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1515, "end": 1527, "text": "(Snell 1975)", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Indole"}, {"text": "Methyl indole is produced from tryptophan via an indole pyruvate pathway by intestinal flora (figure 2, Yokoyama and Carlson 1974) and pathways for phenolic VOCs (phenol, p-cresol, 4-ethyl phenol, phenyl propionate, phenylacetate and benzoic acid) have also been described (figure 2, Macfarlane and Macfarlane 1995) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 104, "end": 130, "text": "Yokoyama and Carlson 1974)", "ref_id": "BIBREF149"}, {"start": 284, "end": 315, "text": "Macfarlane and Macfarlane 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Indole"}, {"text": "For organic acids (including SCFAs) when the pH is above neutral they exist in the ionic dissociated (salt) form and are not volatile, whereas at decreasing pH, a greater proportion of the acid is in the associated (hydrophobic) state, hence more can partition between the liquid and gas phases. For amines, it is the other way round; when the pH is above neutral, amines exist more in their base-form, and it is only in this associated form that the compound can partition into the gas phase. Independent of the effects of pH on VOC phase transitions, pH will also variably affect the production rate of microbial VOCs, e.g. pH inducible amino decarboxylases in bacteria (Viala et al 2011) . Amine production and its role in pH homeostasis in E. coli and Micrococcus lysodeikticus was described nearly 70 years ago by Gale and Epps (1942) . The mechanism occurred as a consequence of low pH inducible amino acid decarboxylase enzymes, which acted on amino acids (particularly glutamate, arginine, lysine and ornithine) producing carbon dioxide and free amine base. At low pH, carbon dioxide is lost from the system (especially in the presence of microbial carbonic anhydrase activity) and the overall balance is for the system to increase the pH from acid towards neutrality. More recently it has been shown how enteric bacteria survive exposure to acidic environments, by inducing genes that provide for acid resistance and pH homeostasis (Bearson et al 1997 , Hall et al 1995 . E. coli has three distinct systems for acid resistance: a glucose-catabolite-repressed system and two amino acid decarboxylase-dependent systems (Castanie-Cornet et al 1999) . Glutamate decarboxylase activity was thought to be the most important pathway in E. coli, the product being gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA; which is not volatile at ambient temperatures), but interestingly lysine decarboxylase (producing the volatile cadaverine) has been shown to be central to pH homeostasis in Salmonella typhimurium (Park et al 1996) .

Early research studies used the Duclaux method to analyse volatile fatty acids produced by bacteria. This was based on the differential volatility of fatty acids in steam (in essence preparative chromatography), whereby sequential distillate portions could be collected and titrated with alkali to determine the concentration (Richmond 1895). The method was used very effectively to assay for formic, acetic, propionic and butyric acid (Zoller and Clark 1920) , and was later improved with more refined quantitative chemical analysis of fatty acid fractions (e.g. mercuric chloride method for detection of formic acids; McNair 1933). The detection of volatile compounds has been used for many years as part of bacterial identification systems, for example the imvic (indole, methyl red, Voges-Proskauer, and citrate) system which differentiates coliforms according to their production of indole, acetoin, and mixed acid fermentation products, in addition to their ability to metabolize citrate (MacFaddin 1980) .

Early studies on microbial volatiles used direct gas-liquid chromatography (Gorbach et al 1976 , Bogaard et al 1986 , whereby compounds were identified from their retention times, using a flame ionisation detector (Ettre 1993). This requires preparation of whole microbial cultures by chemical extraction, and modified methods were developed to enable direct injection of whole microbial cultures or faeces for detection of anaerobic bacteria (Bricknell and Finegold 1973) . The development of 'head-space analysis' of microbial cultures using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) provided more information, was less laborious, and was capable of automation (Larsson et al 1978a , 1978b , Zechman et al 1986 . In particular, the use of mass spectrometry (via electron ionisation) has enabled qualitative and quantitative detection of microbial volatiles by measuring the masscharge ratio of charged sample particles. Subsequent software mining of mass spectral libraries (e.g. NIST or Massfinder) then enables identification of the volatiles present based on the sample mass chromatogram produced. However, this analysis should be performed with caution since many related compounds generate similar mass spectra (Schulz and Dickschat 2007) , and it has been suggested that the structure of many microbial volatiles is yet to be 'unequivocally' identified (Kai et al 2009) . The application of head-space GC-MS has been shown capable of identifying anaerobes (Julak et al 2000, Mardh et al 1981) , facultative bacteria, (Zechman et al 1986) , and fungi (Larsen and Frisvad 1995). The headspace gas sampling procedure initially involved simple purge trap approaches using various adsorbent materials (e.g. charcoal, tenax, super Q), but these are thought to preferentially bind certain compounds according to their chemical composition (Kai et al 2009). Hence, as GC-MS technology has advanced, so has the sampling procedure, and pre-concentration solid phase micro-extraction (SPME; Bojko et al , Julak et al 2003 and closed-loop stripping apparatus (CLSA; Hassett and Rohwer 1999) have greatly improved the sampling efficiency. GC-MS does have some disadvantages being relatively expensive and time-consuming, requiring highly skilled operators, and is reliant on the use of internal standards to identify and quantify each VC component.

For example, ion mobility mass spectrometry separates and identifies ionized molecules (including VOCs) in the gas phase based on their mobility in a carrier buffer gas, and has enabled rapid determination of microbial volatiles in humid samples (milliseconds to minutes) (Eiceman 2002 , Shnayderman et al 2005 . This is a promising technology with real-world applications, but suffers from being unable to differentiate all volatiles within complex samples due to insufficient sensitivity and mass resolution (Smith and Spanel 2005) . To address this issue, a new approach to direct, online microbial headspace analysis has emerged in the form of proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) and selective ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS). These techniques are capable of determining absolute head-space concentrations of VOCs regardless of humidity, and without need for any sample preparation (Mayr et al 2003 , Smith and Spanel 1996 , Smith and Spanel 2005 . PTR-MS uses protonated water (H 3 O+) as a chemical ionisation reagent enabling direct and real-time sampling and analysis of sample specimen headspace (Lindinger et al 1998) . This has been used to quantify VOCs emanating from microbial cultures, enabling not only species specific volatile profile discrimination, but also temporal evolution of VOCs during bacterial growth (Bunge et al 2008, O'Hara and Mayhew 2009) . In contrast, SIFT-MS uses multiple reagent ions (H 3 O+, O 2 + and NO+) to perform soft ionisation. The use of three precursor ions enables internal verification of the VOCs detected, making identification more accurate, and enabling discrimination of isomeric and isobaric compounds (Hu and Storer 2008). The sample gas is delivered to the instrument at a constant rate where it is mixed with microwave generated reagent ions within a fast-flowing helium flow tube. The resultant reaction products are separated and counted downstream by quadrupole mass spectrometry, enabling quantitative measurements of complex volatile mixtures (Allardyce et al 2006a, Smith and Spanel 2005) . Accurate identification and quantification of trace gaseous molecules is possible since the reaction time for molecular interactions is predictable within SIFT-MS instruments, being defined by predetermined rate co-efficients of the ion-molecule reactions (Smith and Spanel 1996) . This technology has now been successfully applied to microbial headspace analysis (Allardyce et al 2006a, Allardyce et al 2006b), being capable of discrimination of bacterial species when coupled with multivariate analysis (Storer et al 2011 , Thorn et al 2011 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 411, "end": 424, "text": "(Eiceman 2002", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 425, "end": 449, "text": ", Shnayderman et al 2005", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 649, "end": 672, "text": "(Smith and Spanel 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 1051, "end": 1067, "text": "(Mayr et al 2003", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1068, "end": 1091, "text": ", Smith and Spanel 1996", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 1092, "end": 1115, "text": ", Smith and Spanel 2005", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 1270, "end": 1292, "text": "(Lindinger et al 1998)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1494, "end": 1523, "text": "(Bunge et al 2008, O'Hara and", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1524, "end": 1536, "text": "Mayhew 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 2196, "end": 2218, "text": "Smith and Spanel 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 2477, "end": 2500, "text": "(Smith and Spanel 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 2726, "end": 2744, "text": "(Storer et al 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 2745, "end": 2763, "text": ", Thorn et al 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Microbial VOC detection (then and now)"}, {"text": "Non-specific pattern recognition of microbial volatiles can be achieved through the use of electronic olfactory systems (e-nose).

For example, experiments using Vero cells have shown carboxylic acid salts to be cytotoxic even down to concentrations of 1-2 mM, with the order of VOC cytotoxicity being: butyrate>propionate>valerate> isovalerate>isobutyrate, with human fibroblast cells being shown to be even more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects (Allaker et al 1985) .

Three main VOC sources can be identified: (1) exogenous sources; VOC's inspired from background ambient gases and then expired again, (2) Extra-oral; from microbes further down the respiratory tract (oropharynx, bronchioles), or else bloodcirculatory VOC's that enter the lungs and, through gaseous exchange, are removed from the body, and (3) Intra-oral; microbial VOCs from microbial biofilms that are encountered in the oral cavity. Exogenous sources depend on the ambient gases around the time and place of the sample streams, and may include industrial-synthetic sources or else VOCs emitted from plants, animals or microbes in the vicinity of the sample. The other two sources (extra-oral and intra-oral) can be differentiated by comparing lung gas samples (e.g. collected via nose) with samples obtained from the mouth, following a period of 'holding' the gas within the mouth (by breathing through the nose) to allow for phase equilibration with the aqueous phase (typically one or two minutes) and finally sampling the mouth gas after this period. The majority of human subjects with halitosis (80 to 90%) have oral malodour because of microbial activity from biofilms within the oral cavity (Miyazaki et al 1995) . For extra-oral halitosis, (about 5-10% of all cases of halitosis), then the majority of patients have blood-borne halitosis (Tangerman and Winkel 2010) . Blood-borne halitosis is frequently caused by odorous VSCs, in particular dimethyl sulfide (CH 3 SCH 3 ). Extra-oral halitosis can potentially be a manifestation of a more serious disease, for which treatment is much more complicated than for intra-oral halitosis. Potential sources of (non-microbial) halitosis include liver and kidney diseases, metabolic disorders, medications and certain foods (Greenman and Saad 2009), and most of these VOCs are therefore produced by the mammalian system (van den Veld et al 2007a). It is therefore of utmost importance to differentiate between intra-oral and extra-oral halitosis. For malodour to be perceived as noticeable and unpleasant, the VOCs in question must be well above the threshold concentration for smell detection by the perceiver. The relative 'smell' of a pure compound can be determined by accurate dilution of the VOC in question to the point where a panel of judges can just detect it. The degree of dilution necessary to reach this point is a measure of the olfactory power (p ol value) of the compound in question (Greenman et al 2004) . The main unit of measurement (p ol by volume) is defined as the negative log of the threshold concentration expressed in volumic or molar fractions, for example, 1 ppm = p ol 6, whilst 1 ppb = p ol 9 (Devos et al 1990).

Most reports now agree that the most frequent sources of halitosis exists within the oral cavity. This includes bacterial reservoirs such as the dorsum of the tongue, saliva and periodontal pockets, where anaerobic bacteria degrade sulfur-containing amino acids to produce the foul smelling volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs); especially hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), methyl mercaptan (CH 3 SH) and dimethyl sulfide (CH 3 SCH 3 ) (Tonzetich 1971) .

Further research (Hartley et al 1999) analysed the tongue microbiota before and after use of a metronidazole mouthwash, a compound that is only effective against strict anaerobes. A reduction in oral malodour correlated closely with the reduction of strict anaerobes (predominantly Gram-negative anaerobes) whilst population levels of other species (facultative and aerobic species) remained constant throughout.

The detection of these compounds is complicated by the high humidity within patient breath samples, but is made possible using pre-concentration steps for GC-MS (Ochiai et al 2001) , or using analytical approaches able to handle high humidity samples without need for sample preparation (e.g. SIFT-MS or PTR-MS; Smith and Spanel 2005) .

The most common category (in terms of numbers of cases) is called gingivitis (inflammation of the gum tissue). This is also described as non-destructive periodontal disease since the tissue damage is limited to gum tissue without any involvement of bone or deeper tissue structures (Armitage 1999). The condition is characterized by its reversibility to normal tissue if treated appropriately, i.e. by removal or inhibition of the aetiological agents, considered to be gingival plaque as a whole (Armitage 2004). The most common form of gingivitis is termed plaque-induced gingivitis, since its magnitude relates to the amount or 'load' of microbes present in the gingival plaque around the gingival margin and crevice (Armitage 1999). In the absence of treatment, gingivitis may progress to periodontitis, which is a destructive form of periodontal disease. In contrast to gingivitis, there are at least six different types of termed destructive periodontal disease because they are essentially irreversible; these include; chronic periodontitis, aggressive periodontitis, periodontitis as a manifestation of systemic disease, necrotizing gingivitis/periodontitis, abscesses of the periodontium and combined periodontic-endodontic lesions (Armitage 2004). Whilst the destructive form involves specific species of periodontopathogens that have penetrated the gingival tissue, the non-destructive gingivitis might be simply the result of diffusion and penetration into gum tissue of small molecular weight biologically active molecules (e.g. VOCs butyrate, hydrogen sulfide, and/or histamine) produced by the plaque biomass 'as a whole' into tissue and known to be cytotoxic or inflammatory as pure compounds (Greenman et al 1988) . While in some sites or individuals, gingivitis never progresses to periodontitis (Ammons et al 1972) , data indicates that periodontitis is nearly always preceded by gingivitis. A group of mainly anaerobic species have been classed as 'periodontopathogens' and are commonly associated with chronic periodontitis. These include the proteolytic Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola, and the asaccharolytic Prevotella intermedia and Eubacterium (Loesche and Grossman 2001).

Indeed, it is thought that the ratio between H 2 S to methyl mercaptan can be reliably used to differentiate gingivitis from periodontitis, and significant correlations have been shown between the H 2 S to methyl mercaptan ratio and periodontal parameters (i.e. severity) (Takeuchi et al 2010) . Likely reasons for the observed differences are thought to be due to the different exposure to sulfur (S)-containing substrates. In gingivitis, the microbes are outside of the tissues and the main sources of Scontaining substrates are obtained from the salivary domain.

The healthy virginal flora is dominated by Lactobacillus species that produce hydrogen peroxide and produce organic acids (mainly lactic acid) from glycogen in the vaginal epithelium; sufficient to maintain the pH to less than pH 4.7 (V\u00e1squez et al 2002) . They may also synthesize bacteriocins and other inhibitory compounds. In vaginosis, these lactobacilli are replaced by an increased concentration of other organisms, especially anaerobes such as Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Prevotella spp., Porphyromonas spp., Bacteroides spp., anaerobic Peptostreptococcus spp., Fusobacterium spp., or Atopobium vaginae (Fredricks et al 2005) . The change in the microflora at the advent of bacterial vaginosis can also be observed microscopically using Gram stain of smears from discharge samples. Gram-positive, long bacilli are predominant in a healthy microflora whilst Gram variable cocci and coccobacilli are dominant in disease. The symptoms of vaginosis can vary from asymptomatic, to one or more of the following: abnormal vaginal discharge (with an unpleasant odour), itching, burning sensation during urination and discomfort during intercourse. Gardnerella vaginalis produces proteolytic carboxylases that decompose vaginal peptides, releasing a variety of amines with fishy odour including putrescine, cadaverine and trimethylamine (Kwak and Preti 2011). These amines volatilize increasingly with rising pH, so patients often note a worsening of this symptom as the vaginal alkalinity is enhanced. Even women considered as clinically normal fall into two types based on their odorant production (Huggins and Preti (1983) .

The precursors to axillary odour are produced by the apocrine glands (Shehadeh and Kligman 1963a , 1963b , Zeng et al 1992 , Gower et al 1994 , and the characteristic axillary odour of humans is formed by the interaction of odourless, precursor molecules found in apocrine secretions with cutaneous, axillary microorganisms Kligman 1963a, Leyden et al 1981) . It is generally considered that freshly secreted sweat is sterile and that body malodour (e.g. under arm odour; UAO) is the result of biotransformation of sweat components by micro-organisms living on the surface of the skin around the apocrine glands (in the proximity of the axilla) to produce VOCs that are odoriferous. In vitro and in vivo studies of the relationship between UAO and the cutaneous microflora have shown the presence of three dominant genera (aerobic coryneforms, Micrococcaceae and propionibacteria) with no competition for habitat between these groups (Preti and Leyden 2010 and references cited therein). A relationship has also been established between severity of cases and the dominance of aerobic coryneforms within the axillary microflora populations, with Corynebacterium xerosis identified as key (Rennie et al 1990) . A statistically significant association between population density of aerobic coryneform bacteria and UAO intensity was observed, whilst no such associations could be found between UAO and population densities of staphylococci, micrococci or propionibacteria (Rennie et al 1990) . With regard to the production of UAO then it had been shown that Corynebacterium species are unusual in possessing 'rare' enzymes or metabolic pathways to biotransform 16-androstene steroids into odiferous products e.g. 5\u03b1-androstenol, 5\u03b1-androstenone, 3\u03b1(\u03b2)-androstenols, 4,16-androstadien-3one as well as keto-substituted compounds. All these example compounds were found to be more odiferous than the 16-androstene steroids used as precursors, and found naturally in fresh apocrine sweat secretions (Rennie et al 1991) . Thus the causal links to the production of high UAO were thought to be clear. However, more recent studies have shown that other pathways to odiferous VOC may be much more important regarding UAO. For example, 3-hydroxy-3-methylhexanoic acid and 3-methylhex-2-enoic acid (and other related acids) are generated via microbial aminoacylase activity from precursors naturally present in axilliary secretions (Natsch et al 2003 , Natsch et al 2006 . The enzyme is a zinc-dependent N\u03b1-acyl-glutamine aminoacylase (N-AGA) produced from Corynebacterium xerosis, Corynebacterium striatum and other species of Corynebacterium, but not in Staphylococcus or Propionibacterium genus. Other precursors may include the N-terminal amino acid of apolipoprotein D that is putatively covalently bound to 3-hydroxy-3-methyl hexanoic acid, and other key odour acids in axillary sweat (Zeng et al 1996 , Akiba et al 2011 . However, these alternate theories regarding biogenesis still correspond with the strong correlation between a high population of corynebacteria and strong axilliary odour. These compounds are highly odiferous and their pattern of production may even be associated with MHC-alleledependent mate selection phenomenon in rodents (Yamazaki et al 1976) and there are strong genetic influences in the patterns of VOCs in humans (Preti and Leyden 2010) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 97, "end": 124, "text": "(Shehadeh and Kligman 1963a", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 125, "end": 132, "text": ", 1963b", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 133, "end": 150, "text": ", Zeng et al 1992", "ref_id": "BIBREF155"}, {"start": 151, "end": 169, "text": ", Gower et al 1994", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 352, "end": 385, "text": "Kligman 1963a, Leyden et al 1981)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1215, "end": 1234, "text": "(Rennie et al 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 1496, "end": 1515, "text": "(Rennie et al 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 2020, "end": 2039, "text": "(Rennie et al 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 2447, "end": 2465, "text": "(Natsch et al 2003", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 2466, "end": 2485, "text": ", Natsch et al 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 2906, "end": 2922, "text": "(Zeng et al 1996", "ref_id": "BIBREF154"}, {"start": 2923, "end": 2941, "text": ", Akiba et al 2011", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3270, "end": 3291, "text": "(Yamazaki et al 1976)", "ref_id": "BIBREF148"}, {"start": 3366, "end": 3389, "text": "(Preti and Leyden 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Skin and skin conditions"}, {"text": "Another important class of VOC, sulfanylalkanols (3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol, 2-methyl-3-sulfanylbutan-1-ol, 3sulfanyl-pentan-1-ol and 3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol), possess strong onion-sulfide smell and have been detected in axilliary odour.

Marshall et al (1987 Marshall et al ( , 1988 ) examined the microflora found on normal feet and found that foot odour was associated with high population densities of staphylococci and aerobic coryneform. Feet with strong odours had significantly higher population densities of microorganisms that produced hydrolytic exoenzymes (lipase, protease, and callous degrading enzymes). Kanda et al (1990) found that isomers of SCFAs were the primary components of foot odour, and Kobayashi (1990) found that Staph. epidermidis, which is a normal resident of the skin, plays a major role in the development of foot odour. Athlete's foot (tinea pedis) is an infection of the foot caused by fungi called dermatophytes which invade the 'dead' outer layers of the skin (Weitzman and Summerbell 1995) . The fungi thrive in warm, moist, and dark environments and the disease was thought to be fairly uncommon before human beings started wearing shoes. Pitted keratolysis occurs worldwide, seen in both tropical and temperate environments, and it can be related to occupation or sport activity. Microbial overgrowth of the normal flora occurs, with species including; Kytococcus sedentarius, Dermatophilus congolensis or species of Corynebacterium, Actinomyces or Streptomyces (Nordstrom et al 1987 , Woodgyer et al 1985 , Longshaw et al 2002 . Under appropriate conditions such as prolonged occlusion, hyperhidrosis and increased skin surface pH, these species proliferate and produce proteinases that destroy the stratum corneum, creating pits (Holland et al 1992) . Dermatophilus congolensis liberates keratinases in appropriate substrate (Hanel et al 1991) , and K. sedentarius has been found to produce two keratindegrading enzymes (Longshaw et al 2002) . The malodour associated with pitted keratolysis is presumed to be the production of sulfur-compound by-products, such as thiols, sulfides, and thioesters (Nordstrom et al 1986) . Strong foot odour (but without pitted skin changes) has also been described due to overgrowth of Staph. epidermidis and production of isovaleric acid from leucine (found in sweat; Ara et al 2006) . Overgrowth of Bacillus subtilis and presence of Brevibacterium have also been associated with strong foot odour.

This does not necessarily provide a barrier to wound healing, and it is only if a wound progresses towards infection, that there will be a failure to move through the phases of healing in a timely manner (Edwards and Harding 2004) . Chronic wounds, including diabetic foot ulcers, leg ulcers and pressure ulcers, are known to be regularly colonized by a large number and diverse species of microorganisms including anaerobic organisms (Howell-Jones et al 2005) , even when no clinical sign of infection is evident, possibly correlating with critical colonisation (Panuncialman and Falanga 2009) . The classic sign of wound infection is inflammation (localized heat, pain, oedema and erythema), but further criteria include abscess, discharge (often purulent), discolouration (within and around wound margins), bleeding (friable) granulation tissue and wound malodour, i.e. VOCs that are odiferous (Edwards and Harding 2004) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 604, "end": 630, "text": "(Edwards and Harding 2004)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 835, "end": 860, "text": "(Howell-Jones et al 2005)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 963, "end": 994, "text": "(Panuncialman and Falanga 2009)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1297, "end": 1323, "text": "(Edwards and Harding 2004)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 378, "end": 397, "text": "(Bowler et al 2001)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Skin and skin conditions"}, {"text": "There have been few studies of volatiles directly emanating from wounds, or wound associated clinical material, as a method of wound classification or diagnosis of infection.

Various compounds were detected (e.g. acetic, butyric and isobutyric acid), but the main fungating wound odorant was identified as dimethyl trisulfide (C 2 H 6 S 3 ), and although no attempt was made to identify its source, it was postulated that this may be the product of bacteria present within the wound bed (Shirasu et al 2009) .

Many different physical in vitro models have been used to study growth, metabolism and VOC production in microorganisms, and these are summarized in figure 5. All models break down into two main systems: closed (figures 5(a) and (b)) and open (figures 5(c), (d) and (e)). Open systems have nutrient flow, which brings new nutrients and removes products. Closed systems usually refer to a batch culture where the microorganisms of interest are coincubated with media and substrates with no additional inputs (i.e. nutrients, media, substrates) or removal of outputs (except those required for analysis). A further distinction can be made for planktonic (i.e. cells in suspension; figures 5(a) and (c)) or biofilm model (figures 5(b), (d) and (e)). Analysis of VOC profiles for a wide number of bacterial species growing planktonically in batch culture mode has now been described (Bunge et al 2008 , Thorn et al 2011 . Although these models can reveal the presence of a wide range of characteristic VOCs for different species, the amounts produced will vary considerably over the period of incubation. In batch culture (figures 5(a) and (b)), growth of the cells goes through different phases (lag, exponential, stationary and decline) and all main physicochemical parameters (substrate concentration, product concentrations, growth rate, growth yield) are never constant. In general, this model is of limited use when trying to extrapolate to how microbes may be behaving in vivo (in response to set changes). In contrast, open systems refer to planktonic culture (figure 5(c)) or biofilm models (figures 5(d) and (e)) that have an element of continuous culture, whereby the nutrient and substrate requirements of the culture are constantly replenished and fed into the system, thus supporting continuous growth. Additionally, outputs from the biofilm (i.e. metabolites, VOCs, cells from microbial growth) are able to leave the system and are available for analysis if required, and dynamic steady states are possible (McBain 2009) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1594, "end": 1613, "text": "(Pavlou et al 2002a", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1614, "end": 1632, "text": ", Thorn et al 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}, {"start": 2514, "end": 2531, "text": "(Bunge et al 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 2532, "end": 2550, "text": ", Thorn et al 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}, {"start": 3231, "end": 3244, "text": "(figures 5(d)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3653, "end": 3666, "text": "(McBain 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "In vitro microbial VOC analysis and identification: models for studying VOC production"}, {"text": "For the vast majority of cases of microbial infections (whether skin, oral cavity, lungs or wound) the microbes attach to a local substratum or matrix to form biofilms (Wilson 2001) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 168, "end": 181, "text": "(Wilson 2001)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "In vitro microbial VOC analysis and identification: models for studying VOC production"}, {"text": "Depending on the particular physicochemical conditions, the microbes utilize local nutrient substrates and multiply. The most immediate source of supply of substrates depends upon the composition of the perfusing fluids found in the nutrient domain of the biofilm. For example, supragingival dental plaque is served by nutrients derived from saliva, whilst subgingival plaque is served with crevicular fluid (which is a serum-derived exudate) (Marsh and Martin 1999) . Typically, a small amount of growth is sustained by immediately available small molecular weight compounds (sugars, amino acids) dissolved in the fluidic domain of the biofilm. This would be blood and serum for infected wounds, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for biofilms in the bronchus/lung, or urine and gastric fluids for urinary tract and gastrointestinal infections respectively. For modelling purposes biofilms are grown under closed ( figure 5(b) ) or open (figures 5(d) and (e)) conditions. For example, caries-like biofilms can be grown by inoculating dental plaque samples onto slices of hydroxyapatite, glass, or plastic surfaces and saliva periodically added or allowed to flow continuously across the biofilm. For a solid impermeable substratum (such as bone and tooth), the bacterial biofilms are only supplying nutrients from above. They form inner layers, intermediate layers and outer layers, such that inner cells are starved of nutrients by the intermediate and outer layers that are more directly exposed to salivary nutrients. A chemical gradient of growth rate limiting nutrients is formed such that the growth rate of the biofilm cells on the inside are close to zero, whilst close to the maximum dictated by local physicochemical conditions on the outside. As a result, there is a wide distribution of both growth rates and molecule residence times within the system as a whole, and hence the biofilm is heterogeneous. This is not the situation on substrata that are freely permeable. For example, biofilms formed on cellulosic or carbon-veil substrata are served with nutrients by local perfusion via micro-channels (figure 5(e)); cells are more equally supplied with nutrients and all grow at similar rates (Spencer et al 2007 , Greenman et al 2008a .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 443, "end": 466, "text": "(Marsh and Martin 1999)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2201, "end": 2220, "text": "(Spencer et al 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}, {"start": 2221, "end": 2243, "text": ", Greenman et al 2008a", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 910, "end": 921, "text": "figure 5(b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "In vitro microbial VOC analysis and identification: models for studying VOC production"}, {"text": "In bad breath research, early experimental studies into oral malodour used a planktonic batch culture model (Tonzetich 1971 , McNamara et al 1972 , Tonzetich and Mcbride 1981 . Kleinberg and Codipilly (1995) examined a range of grampositive (n = 13) and gram-negative (n = 12) pure species supplemented with a range of 18 separate amino acids, and showed that gram-negative organisms produced significantly higher malodorous compounds compared to other groups. Although only batch culture, these models nevertheless helped to confirm the importance of S-metabolism in oral malodour. In dental research, a defined consortium of microorganisms is often used to investigate ecological phenomena such as species interaction, communication (quorum sensing) and competition, which would otherwise be difficult to measure for reasons of complexity. Defined consortiums make use of simplified combinations of organisms that are able to grow together when supplied with same media, and are readily identifiable by selective culture techniques. An example of a defined consortium would be the 'Marsh consortium' developed by Philip Marsh (CAMR, Porton down, Sailsbury, UK) for use in chemostats. This consortium comprises 10 bacterial strains (Bradshaw et al 1996) , representing many of the important physiological and ecological groups that exist in plaque.

They are what remain through survival of the transfer process, from in vivo to model. The diversity of a microcosm is usually less than the original inoculum, although it is nevertheless more diverse than a defined consortium. Microcosms have the advantage of maintaining much of the complexity of the original sample, enabling the in vivo microbial community dynamics to be replicated within the biofilm model. For example, a constant depth film fermentor (CDFF) was used to develop plaque microcosm biofilms from inoculation with real plaque samples, and subsequently removed and analysed for VSC generation ex situ using a portable sulfide analyser (Pratten et al 2003) . The model is an example of a continuous culture biofilm, but with biofilm formation over an impermeable substratum surface (figure 5(d)). In contrast, the 'Sorbarod' system is an example of a continuous flow biofilm using a highly permeable matrix (the Sorbarod; figure 5(e); Hodgson et al 1995). This system has been shown to be capable of maintaining a complex microcosm of tongue-scrape derived inoculums, and this has provided insight into the microbial ecology, physiology and VSC production of oral malodour production (Spencer et al 2007 , Greenman et al 2008b , Taylor and Greenman 2010 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 813, "end": 833, "text": "(Pratten et al 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 1361, "end": 1380, "text": "(Spencer et al 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}, {"start": 1381, "end": 1403, "text": ", Greenman et al 2008b", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1404, "end": 1430, "text": ", Taylor and Greenman 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "In vitro microbial VOC analysis and identification: models for studying VOC production"}, {"text": "Research methods that elucidate the specific VOCs being produced by microbes or emanate from microbial associated disease processes need to be applied (e.g. GC-MS), before developing more 'VOC focused' or non-specific sensors (e.g. e-nose), as this information will inform and improve their development. Consequently, more research is required to further identify microbial specific VOCs, but also to 'unequivocally' identify the structure of these microbial associated VOCs (Kai et al 2009) so as to better enable their future detection. This situation is further complicated by the fact that the specific VOCs produced by a given microbial community in vivo will often differ from that in vitro due to varying growth substrates, presence of other (often uncultivable) competing microorganisms, and the impact of host processes. It is important to adequately define the 'research question' being investigated, and hence for in vitro identification systems substrates should be provided that best discriminate microbial metabolic processes as monitored through VOC analysis. However, when developing in vivo detection systems then any in vitro characterisation must attempt to best replicate the real-world environment, including provision of appropriate growth substrates, and potentially actual clinical material as has been suggested by one author investigating sinus infection (Preti et al 2009) . In future it is likely that headspace gas sample VOC profiles from real conditions (in situ from a human) will be compared to an analogous model in the laboratory (see section on in vitro modelling). The differences can then be used to identify VOCs arising from the mammalian system alone, against those produced in the model (microbial alone).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1381, "end": 1399, "text": "(Preti et al 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Future research directions"}, {"text": "Microbial infection is the root cause and/or the complicating factor of many human diseases, and traditional bacterial identification methods (e.g., culture, serological, and genetic methods) are time-consuming (from hours to days), and in many cases it may be difficult or painful to get specimens or samples (e.g. lung disease, infected wound). The ultimate goal of diagnostic VOC analysis would be online sampling of patient breath and/or body odour, enabling bedside or chairside diagnosis of their status in vivo. The rapid advancement of online VOC analysis technologies (e.g. SIFT-MS, PTR-MS) goes someway to realizing this goal, but future developments must be focused on miniaturizing technology without losing analytical or clinical sensitivity or specificity. Perhaps one of the most under-researched areas in the application of microbial VOC analysis in the clinic is time-course VOC analysis (of patient or patient samples), to assess treatment success or failure. For example, preliminary investigations have shown e-nose technology capable of following progression towards healing during wound care treatment (Edwards-Jones and Greenwood 2003).

Moreover, being non-invasive it would have high patient acceptability. Although more research is needed to truly elucidate microbial VOC generating processes, it is envisaged that in future 'VOC profiling' will enable rapid characterisation of microbial associated disease, providing vital information to healthcare practitioners.
