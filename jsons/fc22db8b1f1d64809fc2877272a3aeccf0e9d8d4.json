Using publicly accessible databases, I explored associations of national BCG vaccination policy with COVID-19 epidemiology in 78 countries. Data collection was conducted from April 25 to May 5, 2020 . I compared countries that have a current universal BCG vaccination policy (BCG countries), with countries that currently lack such a policy (non-BCG countries). The mixed effect model revealed national BCG policy decreases in the country-specific risk of death by COVID-19, correspond to odds ratio of 0.446 (95% confidence interval 0.323 -0.614, P=1\u00d710 \u22125 ). In BCG countries, the case increase rate was attenuated marginally by 25.4% (95% confidence interval 3.0 to 42.7, P=0.029) as compared with those of the non-BCG countries. Although the protective mechanism of BCG vaccination against COVID-19 remains unknown, further laboratory and clinical research should be warranted.",

Countries with less than 100 confirmed cases were excluded from the analysis. I compared countries that have a current universal BCG vaccination policy (BCG countries), with countries that currently lack such a policy (non-BCG countries). 6 I focused two outcome measures to evaluate the impact of national BCG policy on COVID-19 epidemiology. In this study, the case fatality rate (CFR) was defined as the proportion of reported number of deaths due to COVID-19 compared to the total confirmed cases on April 25, 2020. The CFRs of the countries were stratified by BCG policy and were combined by fixed or random effects models to estimate the pooled CFR with 95% .

            "text": "I also tried to determine whether the speed of COVID-19 case increase within the countries was associated with their national BCG policy. I summarized the number of weekly new diagnosed COVID-19 patients in the initial 8 weeks of the epidemic. Because the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic varied by country, I defined the Day 1 as the day the first confirmed COVID-19 patients was reported in the respective country. Using a generalized estimating equation (GEE) with a log-linear link function, I estimated if the slopes of case numbers were different between BCG and non-BCG countries. In the GEE analysis, the population of the country was incorporated as an offset term for adjustment, and robust \"sandwich\" variance estimators were used.",
