Real\u2010time monitoring of PCR has simplified and accelerated PCR laboratory procedures and has increased information obtained from specimens including routine quantification and differentiation of amplification products. Clinical diagnostic applications and uses of real\u2010time PCR are growing exponentially, real\u2010time PCR is rapidly replacing traditional PCR, and new diagnostic uses likely will emerge. This review analyzes the scope of present and potential future clinical diagnostic applications of this powerful technique. Critical discussions focus on basic concepts, variations, data analysis, instrument platforms, signal detection formats, sample collection, assay design, and execution of real\u2010time PCR.",

            "text": "The invention of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) by Kary B. Mullis in the 1980s [1, 2, 3] has been one of the formative events in molecular biology. Its influence is comparable to the discovery of the double\u2010helix structure of DNA or to DNA cloning. Myriads of permutations of this elegant approach to sequence\u2010specific and in vitro exponential DNA replication have opened new avenues of scientific inquiry in biology and have revolutionized molecular biology and medical diagnosis. Clinical laboratory diagnosis was one of the first fields to embrace PCR methodology, mainly because the exquisite sensitivity and specificity of nucleic acid detection by PCR allowed convenient detection of microorganisms that were difficult to cultivate [4, 5] or to confirm by analysis of their products [6, 7]. Subsequently, the concept of reverse transcription (RT) of RNA to cDNA prior to amplification was introduced as RT\u2010PCR that allowed sensitive detection of RNA viruses and eukaryotic mRNA, greatly expanding the use of PCR. Furthermore, the advantage of facile sequence differentiation of amplified nucleic acids was used for genetic typing of microorganisms [8, 9, 10] as well as of mammalian gene polymorphisms such as those of histocompatibility antigens in transplantation medicine [11, 12, 13]. Next, drawbacks of the initial approaches of PCR were recognized such as cumbersome multistep procedures of amplification and subsequent product detection by electrophoresis. The strong operator influence in classic PCR methodology frequently gave rise to false\u2010positive results by product carryover and to false\u2010negative results by PCR inhibition, mostly due to incomplete nucleic acid purification [14]. The shortcomings prompted a flurry of technological innovations of PCR chemistry and instrumentation, culminating in closed\u2010tube methodologies with continuous detection of the amplification products, also termed real\u2010time PCR. These mature technologies now allow quantification of any nucleic acid target in addition to detection and differentiation, because kinetic information about product accumulation is collected. A multitude of real\u2010time PCR platform approaches is presently transforming nucleic acid\u2010based diagnosis in the clinical laboratory. This review will focus on established and generally accepted standard methods of real\u2010time PCR and on aspects that critically influence diagnostic results. Methods for detection of low nucleic acids target copy numbers (typically of microorganisms or mammalian mRNAs) will preferentially highlight the status of the field, since such methods generally are the most demanding applications of PCR. Nevertheless, such technical considerations apply equally to high\u2010copy targets such as in PCRs that identify mammalian genetic polymorphisms. The challenge in these PCRs is the extraction of maximum information from a single specimen by simultaneous amplification of multiple target sequences, also called multiplex PCR [15, 16].",

In this real\u2010time system, the fluorescent dye ethidium bromide intercalates preferentially into double\u2010stranded amplification products, which increases its fluorescence. The progress of PCR amplification can be continuously monitored in real time by acquiring fluorescence signals in each amplification reaction cycle during segments in which double\u2010stranded DNA (dsDNA) is present. Thus, quantitative information of the PCR process is obtained by plotting the intensity of the fluorescence signal versus cycle number. This is in contrast to the traditional PCR approach in which only qualitative information is obtained by detection of presence or absence of a specific dsDNA product by gel electrophoresis at the end of amplification.",

            "text": "Direct product monitoring in real\u2010time PCR also has the advantage that reaction vessels do not need to be reopened after PCR. This minimizes post\u2010amplification processing, and importantly, the potential for sample contamination with products of previous amplifications (product carryover [19]). Aside from the increased information that can be extracted from specimens, the ease of sample processing and prevention of false\u2010positive results has been one of the main incentives for introduction of real\u2010time PCR to clinical diagnostic laboratories [6]. Real\u2010time PCR has been rapidly applied to many areas, such as detecting and quantifying DNA and RNA of microbes [5, 20, 21], genotyping microbes and parasites [8, 22, 23], monitoring the transcription of genes by quantifying mRNA concentrations relative to constantly expressed genes (housekeeping or reference genes) [24, 25, 26], and typing of genetic polymorphisms [11, 12, 13]. The profound impact of PCR and real\u2010time PCR becomes obvious in the numbers of publications with the term \u201cPCR\u201d in the title or keywords. Similar to product accumulation in PCR, the number of PCR publications has increased exponentially since its invention, and among PCR publications the percentage of publications citing real\u2010time PCR also shows a logarithmic increase (Fig. 1\n). These data suggest that real\u2010time PCR methods will replace a large percentage of traditional PCR assays within the next five years.",

This calculation assumes equal and constant efficiency of all standard and unknown sample PCRs.

Rutledge [42] most recently presented a refined sigmoidal approach in which an optimal cut\u2010off cycle prior to the variable plateau phase was mathematically identified and the fluorescence data prior to this cut\u2010off point were fitted with highest precision to a four\u2010parameter sigmoid function (r2 of individual reactions typically 0.99992). In this function, amplification efficiency decreases continuously throughout the amplification process and each cycle has a unique amplification efficiency. Relative quantification can thus be achieved without standard curves and prior knowledge of amplification efficiency by modeling individual amplification reactions. A single calibration standard can convert such relative data into absolute copy numbers. This method has the potential to redefine analysis of real\u2010time PCR by allowing for reliable, fully automated quantification of nucleic acids. This method would also be insensitive to variations in amplification efficiency between individual reactions. Such variations may, for instance, occur by chemical inhibition of PCRs, through competition in multiplex real\u2010time PCRs, or in heat\u2010block real\u2010time PCR instruments.",

In real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR quantification of analyte mRNAs relative to the mRNA of an internal reference gene, the problems are compounded by combining results of two real\u2010time PCRs for each sample. These values are usually related to the corresponding values of a calibration sample or to an absolute standard. Levels of starting templates can again be expressed in absolute terms or relative to the reference mRNA in the same sample. Problems of the quantification accuracy of RT\u2010PCR have been recognized [43, 44] and mathematical approaches have been published for calculations of relative mRNA levels. The methods assume either equal efficiencies of analyte and reference mRNA RT\u2010PCR [45], or do not assume equal efficiencies, but require constant efficiency of analyte and reference RT\u2010PCR [46]. However, it is important to keep in mind that Ct values, and typically used differences between Ct values of analyte and reference mRNA (\u0394Ct), are exponentially related to the numbers of target copies. Thus, small errors in \u0394Ct may become large errors in the ratios. In a simulation with different PCR efficiencies, a real 10\u2010fold difference in mRNA levels was experimentally determined as any value between 0.7 and 210 [37]. These data underscore the extreme importance of tight control of all parameters and rigorous validation of real\u2010time PCR protocols [33]. One\u2010step duplex RT\u2010PCR for simultaneous amplification of analyte and reference gene mRNA has the potential to optimally control variation in experimental parameters [26]. Deduction of starting templates by sigmoidal curve\u2010fitting likely will maximize the accuracy of results [42] and use of a single target DNA standard (without reverse transcription [26]) in this approach likely will allow calculation of absolute starting targets in RT\u2010PCRs.",

The negative first derivative of fluorescence over temperature shows a peak at the temperature of steepest decline in fluorescence (Fig. 3\n). The temperature at peak is equivalent to the T\nM. Similarly, the T\nM of oligonucleotide probes can be determined in an analogous way in PCRs using oligonucleotide, but not hydrolysis (Taqman\n\u00ae) probes.

An advantage is that they accommodate samples in the 96\u2010well format. Historically, heat block instruments tended to have a shortcoming in the uneven temperature distribution across the heat block [62, 63]. Uneven reaction temperature potentially presents a major problem because the accuracy of real\u2010time PCR strongly depends on absolutely uniform temperature ramping and equilibrium temperature of all samples. Even minor temperature differences at each cycle may change PCR efficiency between samples and thus may result in widely divergent results [37, 63]. The profound effect of differences in annealing temperature on real\u2010time PCR accuracy is clearly evident in Fig. 2B. However, the problem of temperature uniformity has been recognized and most current heat\u2010block PCR instruments claim temperature uniformity within \u00b10.5\u00b0C that ensure reproducible and consistent results. Nevertheless, it is highly recommended to carefully evaluate the reproducibility of real\u2010time PCR methods in a new instrument (63).",

SYBR Green I is now the most frequently used dsDNA\u2010specific dye in real\u2010time PCR. It is a cyanine dye and has an asymmetric structure related to the dsDNA\u2010specific dyes YOYO\u20101 and TOTO\u20101. The binding affinity of SYBR Green I to dsDNA is more than 100 times higher than that of ethidium bromide [28, 29]. Intercalation of SYBR Green I does not affect the process of PCR amplification as ethidium bromide does, since SYBR Green I mainly binds to the minor groove of dsDNA. Unbound SYBR Green I exhibits little fluorescence in solution and fluorescence emitted by dsDNA\u2010bound dye is more than 1000\u2010fold higher than that of free dye, therefore this dye is ideally suited for real\u2010time monitoring of PCR amplification. SYBR Green I can be excited at a wavelength of 480 nm and peak fluorescence emission is at 520 nm. In an optimized SYBR Green I real\u2010time PCR, starting templates as low as a single target copy can be detected [5]. In some SYBR Green I real\u2010time PCRs, the accumulation of primer dimers and other nonspecific amplification products may reduce specific amplification. High temperature fluorescence acquisition, just below the melting point of the specific amplification product, but above the melting point of primer dimers, may remedy this problem by collecting only specific signals.",

            "text": "A hydrolysis probe, also termed Taqman\n\u00ae probe, is an oligonucleotide labeled with a 5\u2032\u2010terminal reporter dye and a 3\u2032\u2010terminal fluorescence quencher [67]. In solution, unbound intact probes do not emit fluorescence because the emission of the reporter dye is suppressed by the 3\u2032\u2010terminal quencher. During PCR amplification, primers and probes hybridize to the cognate nucleotide sequence of the amplicon. When Taq DNA polymerase, extending the 3\u2032\u2010end of the primer, reaches the bound probe, the dsDNA\u2010specific 5\u2032\u2010exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase will degrade the probe [30]. Degradation of the probe separates reporter dye and quencher and the reporter dye will emit unquenched fluorescence after excitation [68]. The strongest fluorescence signal is observed when the two labels are at the extreme terminals of the oligonucleotide probe, probably because a single hydrolytic cleavage only of the 5\u2032\u2010nucleotide separates reporter and quencher and releases the signal. The T\nM of hydrolysis probes is critical: binding to the target sequence needs to be tight in order to ensure hydrolysis of the probe rather than displacement by Taq polymerase. At a probe T\nM of 70\u00b0C, performance of the PCR annealing and extension step at 60\u201362\u00b0C will ensure probe binding during primer extension and thus probe hydrolysis and generation of the fluorescent signal. The corollary of the mechanism of hydrolysis probes is that the signal generated is cumulative, because separation of reporter dye from quencher is irreversible. This implies that melting curve analysis is impossible with hydrolysis probes.",

            "text": "FRET probes measure the transfer of energy between two fluorophores that are attached to two oligonucleotide probes [69]. These probes are designed to hybridize to adjacent segments of a nucleotide sequence, and hybridization brings the fluorophore at the 3\u2032\u2010end of the donor probe in immediate proximity of the fluorophore at the 5\u2032\u2010end of the acceptor probe, the fundamental requirement for FRET. The donor probe typically is labeled with fluorescein or a similar fluorophore with an excitation peak around 480 nm wavelength. The acceptor probe may be labeled with one of a multitude of dyes with longer\u2010wavelength peak excitation and emission such as cyanine dyes Cy3 and Cy5, TET (6\u2010carboxy\u20104, 7, 2\u2032, 7\u2032\u2010tetrachlorofluorescein), TAMRA (6\u2010carboxy\u2010N, N, N\u2032, N\u2032\u2010tetramethyrhodamine), or ROX (6\u2010carboxyrhodamine), and must be blocked at its 3\u2032\u2010end to prevent extension during the PCR. When excited by light of 480 nm wavelength, fluorescein of the donor probe will emit green fluorescent light if the probe is in solution. However, if both donor and acceptor probe are hybridized simultaneously to the cognate nucleotide sequence on the amplification fragment, the activation energy of fluorescein will directly transfer to the acceptor dye, which will emit long\u2010wave fluorescent light. Thus, during the PCR annealing step, FRET results in increased long\u2010wave fluorescence proportional to the amount of PCR product. FRET probes ensure very high specificity of detection, because two probes must simultaneously hybridize to adjacent target sequences. In contrast to hydrolysis probes, FRET probes are not degraded and fluorescence is reversible, allowing the determination of probe T\nM in melting curve analysis. Roche Applied Science has developed the fluorophores LightCycler RED\u2010640 and LightCycler RED\u2010705 specifically for use in FRET probes in the LightCycler [32]. However, other Cy5\u2010like fluorophores with similar spectral properties have been also successfully used [26, 70].",

The loop portion is complementary to the target sequence [71, 72]. One arm is labeled with a fluorescent reporter and a quencher is attached to the other arm. The quencher is a nonfluorescent chromophore, which absorbs the emission energy from the fluorophore. In solution, quenching of fluorescence occurs because molecular beacons form a hairpin structure in which the stem keeps the arms together, and thus fluorophore and quencher in close proximity. During PCR annealing, the loop will hybridize to the specific target sequence, resulting in a conformational transition which separates the stem, and thus fluorophore and quencher [31]. This leads to the restoration of detectable fluorescence proportional to the amount of specific PCR amplification product. Similar to hydrolysis probes, molecular beacons require careful probe design. The stem must be optimized to ensure a complete stem\u2010loop structure in solution, but effective unfolding and probe hybridization during PCR annealing. Suboptimal probe designs lead to a large background signal if the stem is not stable and to poor signal if probe annealing is unstable. Therefore, PCR annealing temperature and T\nM of stem and loop of molecular beacons require careful optimization [71, 72].",

Inhibition of amplification during the assembly phase of a PCR is highly effective in reducing nonspecific amplification. This approach is termed hot\u2010start PCR, because amplification ensues only after the first heating step. Hot\u2010start PCR has traditionally been achieved by a multitude of approaches. Most frequently, wax has been layered on incompletely assembled reactions, followed by addition of the remaining reaction components [88]. The first heating step then melted the wax, resulting in mixing of all reaction components and initiation of amplification. This cumbersome approach has been virtually completely replaced in real\u2010time PCR by initial inactivation of the DNA polymerase in fully assembled reaction. Inactivation is typically achieved via antibody directed against the active site of the enzyme [89] or via use of a recombinant Taq DNA polymerase with a sequence deletion that renders the enzyme inactive without exposure to high temperature [90]. These hot\u2010start methods are highly effective and real\u2010time PCR is mostly performed as hot\u2010start reaction.",

Amplification facilitators affect amplification by modifying the thermal stability of the template or affecting the accuracy of DNA polymerase, and influence overall PCR performance and frequently alleviate inhibition of amplification [82]. For example, glass capillaries used in LightCycler platforms require higher levels of bovine serum albumin than polypropylene reaction tubes [5], presumably to block surface binding of reaction components.",

The first step is reverse transcription of RNA to cDNA, followed by the real\u2010time PCR. The reverse transcription may be performed separately from PCR as part of a two\u2010step RT\u2010PCR, or preceding the PCR in a one\u2010step reaction in the PCR vessel. The advantage of the two\u2010step system is that a pool of cDNA can be created that can be used for quantification of multiple target mRNAs. Conversely, one\u2010step RT\u2010PCR minimizes the number of steps in a protocol and thus the potential for inaccuracies. Two\u2010step real\u2010time PCR typically utilizes random oligonucleotides or oligo(dT), one step RT\u2010PCR predominantly uses the specific PCR primers for priming reverse transcription. Total RNA is used as a template for reverse transcription, but use of poly(A)+ RNA increases sensitivity. DNase treatment of extracted nucleic acids is required if the RT\u2010PCR does not discriminate between target genomic DNA and cDNA. The mostly frequently used reverse transcriptases are avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (AMV\u2010RT) and moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (MMLV\u2010RT) and recombinant engineered versions of these enzymes [94, 95]. MMLV\u2010RT is less robust than AMV\u2010RT, but has lower RNase H activity than AMV\u2010RT. Since RNase H activity interferes with the synthesis of long cDNAs, MMLV\u2010RT is preferred for generating full\u2010length cDNA molecules.",

In duplex or multiplex RT\u2010PCR, the concentration of the reference mRNA should be less than 100\u2010fold different from the analyte mRNA, in order to avoid competitive PCR inhibition of the lower copy mRNA. The expression of these internal controls should also be independent of normal physiological and pathological changes. The three most frequently used reference transcripts are ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), \u03b2\u2010actin (ACTB), and glyceraldehyde\u20103\u2010phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). However, none of these targets is universally suited as reference transcript. rRNAs are abundant, stably expressed, but can be used only in total RNA preparations and the expression levels are very high in comparison to most mRNAs [43, 96, 97]. ACTB is highly expressed, but less abundant than rRNAs, varying expression levels have been reported and the existence of pseudogenes needs to be considered in the design of oligonucleotides [24, 98]. GAPDH is the most problematic of the reference RNAs, with inconstant expression reported [43, 99, 100].

These reactions are possible because probes labeled with fluorescent dyes with different excitation and emission spectra can be used and discriminated concurrently in real\u2010time PCR platforms. Multiple photodetectors and electronic compensation of overlapping emission spectra ensure specificity and accuracy of data [101]. In theory, multiplex PCR saves time and cost, and reduce the required sample volume. However, multiplex real\u2010time PCR is burdened with a number of inherent technical challenges: (i) all amplifications must be designed for identical reaction parameters; (ii) the parallel amplifications compete with each other; and (iii) the probability for undesirable interaction between amplifications increases with the number of targets in a multiplex PCR. For these reasons, successful multiplex approaches have almost exclusively been used for typing of genetic polymorphisms in real\u2010time PCR with high starting template numbers [4, 102, 103]. Wang et al. [26] established a duplex real\u2010time PCR approach on the LightCycler platform for simultaneous quantification of transcripts of a reference and analyte gene in a one\u2010step RT\u2010PCR. This approach is accurate and sensitive, and uses hot\u2010start and step\u2010down cycling and high\u2010temperature annealing between 63\u00b0C to 72\u00b0C after reverse transcription at 55\u00b0C for 20 min.",

DeGraves et al. [5] established an efficient real\u2010time PCR platform to detect single Chlamydia spp. organisms in the LightCycler by SYBR Green fluorescence and by FRET hybridization probes. This sensitivity is approximately equivalent to detection of a single target in a 1012\u2010fold background of unrelated DNA. The number of chlamydial genomes detected by FRET PCR correlated well with cell culture determination of inclusion forming units [5]. Using optimized nucleic acid extraction methods [77], these PCR methods are at least 150\u2010fold, but typically about 1000\u2010fold more sensitive than the cell culture quantitative assay. Detection of exotic bacteria such as the methanotropic bioremediating Methylocystis spp. has also been improved by real\u2010time PCR [130].",

A number of factors have contributed to this impact: (i) in terms of genetic complexity, viruses are the simplest pathogens; (ii) isolation of nucleic acids from viruses is not complicated by the need to break up rigid membranes of the agents; and (iii) the effort of standard microbiological diagnosis by culture is greater than for many other pathogens, thus real\u2010time PCR diagnosis compares favorably with standard virological methods [134]. Real\u2010time PCR helps to identify co\u2010infections in epidemiological studies, discriminates a multiplicity of viral genotypes within a single reaction vessel, gives accurate quantitative results of viral infection load and its change after antiviral therapy, and demonstrates the epidemiological links between unique viral sequences and clinical signs of disease [20, 135, 136, 137, 138]. Therefore, real\u2010time PCR has been used widely for detection of viruses in humans, animals, and plants, and in specimens such as cells, tissue cultures, swabs, serum, plasma, saliva, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid.",

Specific FRET real\u2010time PCRs were developed to diagnose Toxoplasma gondii, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Cryptosporidium parvum [157]. The traditional culture method, mouse inoculation, and serological detection are time\u2010consuming and insensitive, while real\u2010time PCR vastly improved speed and sensitivity of diagnosis of parasites such as Toxoplasma gondi. C. parvum oocysts and Encephalitozoon spp. have been genotyped by use of real\u2010time PCR, which was highly advantageous over conventional laboratory microscopic diagnosis for low\u2010concentration samples [158, 159]. Real\u2010time PCR assays were also successfully applied to the diagnosis of diseases caused by Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus flavus [6, 160]. Similar methods were utilized to investigate the presence of potentially harmful concentrations of toxic fungal spores and conidia produced by Stachybotrys chartarum [7].",

The HER\u20102 proto\u2010oncogene is expressed by, and involved in the growth of, 20\u201330% of metastatic breast cancers [164, 165]. Positive HER\u20102 status may indicate a poor prognosis and aggressive tumor transformation [166]. The topo II\u03b1 gene is located near HER\u20102 within the chromosome band region 17q12\u2013q21, an area that is often mutated in breast tumors. Immunohistochemistry is the conventional HER\u20102 testing method interpreted by anatomic pathologists, but this technique is subjective and error prone, and it is difficult to differentiate between weakly positive and background staining [167]. In contrast, real\u2010time PCR provides a rapid and sensitive quantitative analysis of the HER\u20102 gene and its expression [168]. Duplex real\u2010time PCR can be used to detect DNA amplification of HER\u20102 concomitant with topo II\u03b1 alterations in a single reaction, and changes in topo II\u03b1 mRNA copy number indicate the chemotherapy response to topo II\u03b1 inhibitor drugs [169].",

Small mutations occur frequently in carcinomas and somatic mutations may accumulate during the evolution of many tumors and may significantly impact the course of the malignancy [170]. The p53 tumor suppressor gene is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancers. Initially, p53 was thought to function as oncogene, because over\u2010expression of p53 appeared to cause oncogenic transformation of cells [171]. However, several critical discoveries defined the normal function of wild\u2010type p53 as anti\u2010oncogenic, and screening of DNA from colon cancer patients revealed that p53 mutations occur with unusually high frequency in tumor tissue, an observation that was extended to most of the other major forms of human cancer. Most mutations in p53 are seen in the DNA\u2010binding domain as single base changes [172]. Using real\u2010time PCR, overlapping fluorescein\u2010labeled probes were used to scan colon cancers for mutations in exons encoding the DNA\u2010binding domain of p53, and somatic mutations were identified by melting curve analysis. Compared to the p53 nonmutated wild\u2010type profile, mutated p53 induces additional peaks or creates changes in peak areas in the melting curve analysis [161].",

Real\u2010time PCR has been used very effectively at quantifying such gene amplifications at the chromosomal DNA level in numerous types of tumors [174, 175, 176]. Zatkova et al. [177] found 8q amplification in hepatoblastomas by a real\u2010time, PCR\u2010based genomic copy assay, and subsequently evaluated the transcript levels of four genes and expressed sequence tags within this chromosomal region. The PLAG1 oncogene, a transcriptional activator of IGF2 in other tumor types, was found highly overexpressed relative to normal liver tissue.

Ultrasound and biochemical tests have become the standard procedures to screen for fetal chromosomal abnormalities, but require confirmation by cytogenetic analysis of amniotic fetal cells. Two standard methods to obtain fetal cells, amniocentesis usually performed at 15 weeks of gestation and chorionic villus sampling at 9\u201311 weeks of gestation, are invasive and have the risk of induced abortion. To alleviate parental anxiety, accelerated molecular diagnosis of aneuploidy is highly preferable over time\u2010consuming karyotyping of cultured fetal cells [182]. Real\u2010time PCR is currently replacing many of these rapid molecular techniques for uncultured fetal cells that can deliver results in 1\u20132 days. For instance, in a duplex real\u2010time PCR assay for trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), the most common cytogenetic anomaly, simultaneous amplification from amniocytes or chorionic mesenchyme of the chromosome 12 locus GADPH and the amyloid gene locus on chromosome 21 allows the determination of chromosomal ploidy, and thus diagnosis of trisomy 21 [183, 184]. Other prenatal diagnoses by real\u2010time PCR from amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling include the most common beta\u2010thalassemia mutations [185], achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia [186], and even an infectious disease, congenital toxoplasmosis [187].",

The strengths of this still developing technology are manifold: ease and speed of assay execution for large batches of samples; highest sensitivity (single targets can be detected in a \u223c1012\u2010fold excess of unrelated nucleic acids); wide dynamic range (at least six orders of magnitude) of detection and quantification with a linear relation between log target to detection threshold cycle; highest specificity approaching 100% in well designed assays with hybridization probes; and differentiation of detected nucleic acid sequences. These advantages ensure that real\u2010time PCR will continue to replace ever more diagnostic assays in the clinical laboratory and that new assays will be developed that would not have been possible without real\u2010time PCR. Current trends clearly indicate that, within the next decade, real\u2010time PCR will become the dominant method in genetics\u2010based diagnostics.",

For instance, use of dUTP\u2010uracil glycosylase reaction chemistry reliably prevents product carryover and has become standard in real\u2010time PCR. False\u2010positive results may also be caused by contamination during sample handling and nucleic acid extraction. Careful sample handling, dedicated laboratories and equipment, well\u2010trained personnel, and a well\u2010planned and strictly forward\u2010moving workflow are essential to control systematic contamination problems [104]. However, some problems still impede wider use of real\u2010time PCR technology in the clinical diagnostic laboratory [33]. The main problem is quality assurance and consistency of results, divided into two main areas: (i) false\u2010negative results and (ii) inaccurate quantification and differentiation. Certain aspects of real\u2010time PCR, as highlighted below, disproportionally contribute to inconsistent results.",

Poorly designed real\u2010time PCR assays can easily be recognized in a limiting standard template dilution series by the rapidly declining slopes of the linear phase of semi\u2010log amplification plots. To ensure high PCR efficiency, the prerequisite for robustness, careful optimization of real\u2010time PCR assays in a limiting template dilution series is vital. If many different PCR assays are performed, it is easier to modify thermal reaction parameters for optimum robustness than to modify reaction chemistry. One of the most effective ways to improve PCR efficiency is the use of a step\u2010down thermal protocol prior to fluorescence acquisition cycling.",

Panels A and B show the real\u2010time PCR amplification of a segment of the 23s rRNA gene of Chlamydia pneumoniae from 7\u2010fold template dilutions [76]. PCRs of panel A were performed at high\u2010stringency annealing at 56\u00b0C, those of panel B at low\u2010stringency annealing at 48\u00b0C. An amount of 105 starting templates was used at the highest concentration (leftmost curve) in both PCR series. A, at high stringency, amplification in the linear exponential phase is close to 2\u2010fold per cycle (efficiency \u2248 2), and approximately 2.8 additional cycles are required to generate the threshold signal for each subsequent 1:7 template dilution (22.8 \u2248 7). Parallel slopes of the linear phase at different starting template numbers indicate equal efficiency of the PCRs. B, low stringency annealing caused extensive formation of aberrant amplification products and reduced efficiency during late PCR cycles at low copy numbers. This is evident in decreasing slopes of the linear phase for decreasing starting template numbers, and resulted in progressively increasing Ct values for higher dilutions of the template.",
