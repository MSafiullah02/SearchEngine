Monitoring schemes must also incorporate verification of water quality at critical control points (Walker et al. 2016, Halliwell et al. 2014, Salveson et al. 2014). Figure 2 shows examples of grab samples at critical control points through an advanced treatment scheme at a potable reuse facility. For direct potable reuse, the absence of an environmental buffer reduces failure response times, so the overall treatment process and associated monitoring program must be resilient enough to respond quickly and effectively if off\u2010specification water is encountered (Pepper & Snyder 2016, Pecson et al. 2015).",

E. coli, Enterococcus spp., and fecal coliforms are often used as indicators of fecal bacteria. E. coli and enterococci are recommended by USEPA as an indicator of fecal pollution in freshwater recreational waters because levels of these organisms were shown to be more accurate than fecal coliforms at predicting gastrointestinal illness (USEPA 2012, 2004). Fecal coliforms may also be selected for monitoring simply because many utilities already use fecal coliforms for routine testing.

Monitoring for pathogenic viruses is challenging because not only are they notoriously difficult to detect, there are more than 100 pathogenic enteric viruses and viruses (USEPA 2017). However, viruses cannot replicate outside of their host and thus cannot multiply during wastewater or reclaimed water treatment.

No single method achieves all of these goals, so a suite of methods is recommended (Mosher et al. 2016). Indicator organisms must be present in sufficient concentrations to assess removal and must either strongly correlate to or be conservative with respect to the pathogen of interest. Samples are typically concentrated to improve sensitivity using membrane filters, magnetic beads, or microfluidic devices that discriminate particles on the basis of charge or size. Molecular biological methods are highly sensitive\u2014i.e., able to detect single copies of a genome. One concern with molecular methods is that they do not distinguish viable from nonviable cells or infectivity of viruses. Immunological methods tend to be more rapid than molecular biology methods because they don't require as much sample pretreatment, but they are less sensitive (Connelly & Baeumner 2012).

Often chemical toxicity is nonadditive and may be synergistic or antagonistic. Scientific studies have demonstrated that combinations of chemicals that would not elicit an effect on their own can induce significant toxicity when combined (Margiotta\u2010Casaluci et al. 2013). Conversely, antagonistic effects between suites of chemical constituents may occur. Because of the complex nature of constituents in wastewater, in addition to potential synergistic effects of mixtures of compounds, biological assays that can rapidly and comprehensively screen water for a suite of toxicological end points may be useful. However, biological assays tend to be subjective and thus should be used appropriately.",

These include assays that were sensitive to induction of specific modes of toxicity, such as mutagenicity and genotoxicity, xenobiotic toxicity, reactive toxicity, cytotoxicity, and endocrine disruption, among other modes of action. The conclusions of the study demonstrated that while there are limitations to bioassay techniques, they are a valid tool for water quality assessment that complement chemical analyses. A recent study incorporating 36 bioassays covering 18 biological endpoints indicated that a suite of bioassays can be useful in characterizing multiple toxicological pathways relevant to human health and can guide decision\u2010making with regard to the treatment processes (Jia et al. 2015). The science advisory panel, which convened in 2018 to evaluate risks from CECs in water treated for reuse, recommended that estrogen receptor alpha and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor bioassays be used to respectively assess estrogenic and dioxin\u2010like biological activities in recycled water (Drewes et al. 2018). However, these technologies are relatively immature and require further development in order to identify, create, and standardize bioanalytical tools.",

Complex monitoring programs tracking trace chemical constituents aren't required, but indicator compounds such as sucralose or cotinine can be useful to characterize removal of more recalcitrant compounds. Commonly used bulk indicators, such as turbidity and conductivity, remain useful to assess removal of pathogenic organisms, but they have limitations. Additional characterization of pathogen removal using indicator organisms (e.g., total coliform bacteria, Clostridium perfringens, viral indicators, bacteriophages), incorporating a combination of physical detection, cell culture, and/or molecular biological assays, may provide useful information to enhance characterization of water quality and subsequent advanced water treatment.",
