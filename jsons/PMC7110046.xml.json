In Co-IP analysis, when the mixture of HAb18G/CD147 and CyPA was added, CyPA was found to be indirectly bound to the gel, mediated by the specific interaction of HAb18G/CD147 to its MAb, HAb18, which was used as the capture antibody. Thus, the HAb18-HAb18G/CD147-CyPA complex was formed. After the coimmunoprecipitated CyPA was eluted, it was visible by Western blot analysis performed with anti-CyPA antibody, which confirmed the interaction between CyPA and HAb18G/CD147 (figure 1A). Co-IP analysis further confirmed the interaction between N protein and CyPA. Since CyPA was used as the bait protein, the coimmunoprecipitated N protein was visible by Western blot analysis performed with anti\u2013N protein antibody (figure 1B).

S protein of the other known CoVs is regarded to be responsible for both binding to receptors on host cells and membrane fusion [2]. In the present study, we have found that N protein may play a role in invasion of host cells by SARS-CoV. N protein was bound to CyPA, but S, M, and E proteins were not. However, CyPA was present only on the surface of mature SARS-CoVs, as observed by electronic microscopy. This finding seems to be contradictory to the finding that N protein locates in the core of the virus. This difference can be partly explained by the finding of a previous report that CyPA bound to viral proteins in the core can be relocated from the core to the viral surface during maturation of the virus [35]. The results of the present study also confirm the interaction between CyPA and HAb18G/CD147, as determined by Co-IP analysis, indicating that CyPA may act as a mediator between SARS-CoV N protein and HAb18G/CD147 in the process of invasion of host cells by SARS-CoV. By flow-cytometric analysis, confocal microscopy, and immunoelectronic microscopy, we found that HAb18G/CD147 was highly expressed in the SARS-CoV\u2013permissive 293 cells and that it was located on the cytomembrane and the unit membrane in the cytoplasm (especially on the membrane of ER) as a transmembrane molecule. In the present study, the binding site of AP-9 was confirmed to be on the HAb18G/CD147 molecule in the infected 293 cells, and AP-9 could efficiently block the binding sites of HAb18G/CD147 on the cytomembrane and the unit membrane in the cytoplasm of the 293 cells and had an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV in vitro. From this finding, we can conclude that HAb18G/CD147 is a functional molecule in SARS-CoV infection of host cells",

SARS-CoV is believed to have a similar process in the life cycle [36]. Therefore, we also inferred that SARS-CoV N protein associated with CyPA could interact with HAb18G/CD147 located on the membrane of ER and that the interaction could facilitate the virus particles in forming or budding into ER. AP-9, the small peptide, could enter the cells to prevent the virus particles from forming or budding into ER, by blocking HAb18G/CD147 located on ER.
