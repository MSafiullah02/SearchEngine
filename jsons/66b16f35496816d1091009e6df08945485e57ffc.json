Here we assessed SARS-CoV2 from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia alongside 21 sequences of SARS-CoV, bat SARS-like CoVs and MERS-CoV, the latter currently detected in this 22 AUTHOR SUMMARY 44 The emergence and subsequent pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 is a unique challenge to countries all 45 over the world, including Saudi Arabia where cases of the related MERS are still being reported. 46 Saudi SARS-CoV-2 sequences were found to be likely of the same or similar origin. In our analysis, 47 SARS-CoV-2 were more closely related to bat SARS-like CoVs rather than to MERS-CoV (which 48 originated in Saudi Arabia) or SARS-CoV, confirming other phylogenetic efforts on this pathogen. 49 Recombination and positive selection analysis further suggest that bat coronaviruses may be at 50 the origin of SARS-CoV-2 sequences. The data shown here give hints on the origin of this virus 51 and may inform efforts on transmissibility, host adaptation and other biological aspects of this 52 virus. 53 54 157",

Our analysis showed that all Saudi SARS-CoV-2 sequences are of the same origin 24 and closer proximity to bat SARS-like CoVs, followed by SARS-CoVs, however quite distant to 25 MERS-CoV. Moreover, genome recombination analysis revealed two recombination events 26 between SARS-CoV-2 and bat SARS-like CoVs. This was further assessed by S gene recombination 27 analysis. These recombination events may be relevant to the emergence of this novel virus. 28 Moreover, positive selection pressure was detected between SARS-CoV-2, bat SL-CoV isolates 29 and human SARS-CoV isolates. However, the highest positive selection occurred between SARS- 30 CoV-2 isolates and 2 bat-SL-CoV isolates (Bat-SL-RsSHC014 and Bat-SL-CoVZC45). This further 31 indicates that SARS-CoV-2 isolates were adaptively evolved from bat SARS-like isolates, and that 32 a virus with originating from bats triggered this pandemic. This study thuds sheds further light on 33 the origin of this virus. 16, 17] . Structurally, S is composed of two functional subunits essential for 79 binding to the host cell receptor (S1 subunit) and virus-host cell fusion (S2 subunit) [18] . The S1 breakpoints existed in a single sequence, the sequence region between the breakpoints was 130 denoted the \"minor\" region, triggered by the minor parent, while the remaining part is called the 131 \"major\" region, provoked by the major parent. As a consequence, Neighbor-joining phylogenetic 132 trees were generated to display the probable topological shifts of specific sequences. 133 Phylogenetic discrepancy is revealed by a putative recombinant whose distance in the phylogeny 134 is obviously close to a single parent whilst far from another for each sequence segment [27] . Since both recombination events appeared in the S gene region, sequences of S genes of the 13 234 CoVs were extracted for multiple alignment using ClustalW, followed by finding the best 235 substitution model to be implemented in the phylogenetic analysis. GTR and TN93 models were 236 the best fitting owing to achieving the least BIC of 51289.85 and 51325.49, respectively. 237 Consequently, the phylogenetic tree was constructed using TN93 model and although, it was 238 constructed using the NJ method (Fig 4) , and the obtained tree was consistent with the tree Next, a molecular clock analysis was carried out using the ML method to examine if the S gene of 294 the 13 isolates used in the current study have the same evolutionary rate throughout the tree. It 295 was found that the strains are not evolving at similar rate indicated by rejection of the null 296 hypothesis of equal evolutionary rate throughout the tree at a 5% significance level (P = 297 0.000E+000) as shown in Table 5 .",

The disease symptoms depicted in SARS-CoV-2 infections were 59 found similar to the infections caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 [3], however it 60 would appear that the case case fatality rate is considerably lower [4]. A virus related to SARS-61 CoV, Middle East Respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) originated from camels in the 62 Middle East and cases are still reported by the Ministry of Health of the Kingdom of different from two zoonotic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that caused 65 human disease earlier in the twenty-first century. Beforehand, the Coronaviridae Study Group, 66 an ICTV working group, determined each of these later two viruses prototype as a new species in 67 new subgenera of the genus Betacoronavirus, Sarbecovirus and Merbecovirus [7, 8].

Human coronaviruses like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are pathogens of 73 zoonotic origin [10]. Previous sequence analysis showed a high percentage of similarity among 74 SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and bat corona viruses [11, 12]. 75 Coronaviruses contains mainly four types of structural and several non-structural proteins [10, 76 13, 14]. The spike protein S is one of the structural protein plays a key role in recognition and 77 attachment of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to the host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 78 (ACE2) receptor [15,",

These methods are entirely used and compared in order to get consensus results. A 121 putative recombination event was passed to consequent analysis only if it was plausibly defined 122 by at least 3 of the above-mentioned seven algorithms [24]. The minor parent was defined as the 123 one contributing by the smaller fraction of the obtained recombinant, whereas the major parent 124 was that contributing by the larger fraction of the yielded recombinant [25]. Moreover, the 125 recognized recombination events were detected with a Bonferroni corrected P-value cut-off of 126 0.01. In order to avoid the possibility of false-positive results, phylogenetic analysis of the 127 detected recombination was performed [24, 26].

This was followed by finding the best model that could be 142 implemented when constructing the phylogenetic tree upon analysis. Models with the lowest BIC 143 scores (Bayesian Information Criterion) are considered to depict the substitution pattern best. 144 Moreover, AICc value (Akaike Information Criterion, corrected), Maximum Likelihood value (lnL), 145 and the number of parameters (including branch lengths) are considered For each model [28]. 146 Non-uniformity of evolutionary rates among sites may be modeled via applying a discrete 147 Gamma distribution (+G) with 5 rate categories and assuming that a certain fraction of sites is 148 evolutionarily invariable (+I). Furthermore, tree topology was automatically computed to 149 estimate ML values. This analysis involved 13 nucleotide sequences. Evolutionary analyses were 150 conducted in MEGA X [22].

Recombination analysis of S gene and of SARS-CoV-2 whole 382 genome suggested bat SARS-like CoV as the major parental strain. Recombination analysis of S 383 sequence added the possibility of contribution of a SARS-CoV-like sequence though this requires 384 further examination. This finding was supported by a previous study that reported about past 385 recombination detected in the S gene of WHCV (WH-Human 1 coronavirus referred to as '2019-386 nCoV' of Wuhan, China), SARS-CoV and bat SARS-like CoVs including WIV1 and RsSHC014 isolates 387 [12]. The later isolate agrees with our recombination analysis results obtained for SARS-CoV-2 388 whole genome. However, recombination analysis of S region revealed another major parental 389 strain which is bat-SL-CoVZC45. This isolate was reported to have a significant nucleotide identity 390 (82.3 to 84%) with SARS-CoV-2 S sequence and is a closer relative [2, 12], and might therefore act 391 as a closer probable ancestor to SARS-CoV-2 [44]. Moreover, the second recombination event, 392that considered bat-SL-CoV_As6526 isolate as a major parent, was reported to be of low-quality 393 owing to being below the acceptable limit (approved by 2 out of 7 algorithms; minimum approval 394 limit is 3). This might be because of the fact that bat-SL-CoV_As6526 isolate (BetacoronavirusClade 2) was reported to have deletions in the RBD [45] resulting in enhanced entry using ACE-2 receptor only upon protease treatment, unlike SARS-CoV-2 [46]. However, bat-SL-CoV_As6526 397 as a recombination contributor is still possible since SARS-CoV-2 S contains most of the contact 398 points with human ACE2 present in clade 1 (Containing SARS-CoV some bat-SL-CoVs as SCH014), 399 besides some amino acid variations which are distinctive to clade 2 (containing the As6526 isolate 400 and other bat-SL-CoVs) and 3 (containing the BM48-31 isolate) [46]. In conclusion, our analysis of 3 Saudi SARS-2-CoV-2 and 7 representative bat SARS-like CoV, 2 human SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV gives further hints about origin of this pandemic virus, in 403 particular with regards to recombination events that underlie SARS-CoV-2 evolution.
