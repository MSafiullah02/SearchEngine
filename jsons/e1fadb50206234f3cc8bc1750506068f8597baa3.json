This relationship allows the host to maintain the balance between active immunity to pathogens and vaccines and tolerance to self-antigens and food antigens. In children living in low-income and middle-income countries, undernourishment and repetitive gastrointestinal infections are associated with the failure of oral vaccines. Intestinal dysbiosis associated with these environmental influences, as well as some host-related factors, compromises immune responses and negatively impacts vaccine efficacy. To understand how immune responses to viral vaccines can be optimally modulated, mechanistic studies of the relationship between the microbiome, host genetics, viral infections and the development and function of the immune system are needed. We discuss the potential role of the microbiome in modulating vaccine responses in the context of a growing understanding of the relationship between the gastrointestinal microbiota, host related factors (including histo-blood group antigens) and resident immune cell populations.",

Immune responses to oral cholera, poliovirus (PV) and rotavirus (RV) vaccines are significantly lower in children from LMICs than those of children from HICs [2] . For example, only 58% of Nicaraguan and 46% of Bangladeshi children respond to oral RV vaccine while the efficacy of the vaccine in Finland is over 98% [3] [4] [5] . The poor immune responsiveness to vaccination characteristic for LMICs is multifactorial and is associated with host-associated (genetics and commensal microbiota), pathogen-associated (genetic diversity) and environmental factors [6-8,9 ,10,11 ] ( Figure 1 ).",

Additionally, breastfeeding is known to modulate vaccine responses in infants via altering the microbiome composition and maternal antibody interference with the development of the active (post-vaccine) immune response [19] . High levels of neutralizing antibodies (Ab) in the breast milk of mothers from LMICs were shown to correlate with lower seroconversion rates in their children, suggestive of maternal Ab interference with the 'take' of oral RV vaccines. However, restriction of breastfeeding did not enhance the IgA immune response to oral RV vaccines in children [20 ,21] .",

Numerically decreased IgA and IgG Ab responses were also observed in the dysbiotic HMA piglets further emphasizing the suboptimal HRV vaccine performance associated with intestinal dysbiosis. Importantly this study emphasizes that dysbiotic microbiome is the primary factor associated with the decreased immune responses, because unlike in infant donors, EED was not evident in the HMA piglets. Further, these results and our previous data [32] suggest that specific pathological microbial signatures can be maintained after dysbiosis was induced and can even be transferrable to another host, negatively affecting their immunity. The latter indicates that maternal dysbiosis can be transferred to infants and leading to health and developmental setbacks in early life.",

Zinc is another micronutrient that is often deficient in low income settings and affects the efficiency of oral vaccines. Mice on a zinc-deficient diet had decreased Th1 and IgG responses to a Hepatitis B vaccine [61] . While zinc deficiency is linked with poor vaccine responses and can modify the composition of the microbiota [62] , direct competition between intestinal bacteria and the host for zinc may explain why oral supplementation of zinc does not compensate for its deficiency.",

TLRs on epithelial and dendritic cells (that can extend their dendrites through the epithelial layer) come into direct contact with luminal microorganisms [76] . These TLR-microbial interactions induce production of anti-microbial peptides and secretory (polymeric) IgA by epithelial and immune cells, respectively [77, 78] .

These provide examples of the influence of host genetics on the intestinal microbiome composition and suggests that HBGA-mediated modulation of the intestinal microbiome may contribute to the observed variations in the vaccine efficacy. Thus, future vaccine trials should account for HBGA status or offer optimized multivalent vaccines that can perform equally well in hosts with different HBGAs.",

            "text": "LMICs. Alterations in the intestinal microbiota are currently being recognized as a leading factor associated with vaccine failures, and their effects are being evaluated in human clinical trials. Supplementation with specific strains of probiotics has been shown to have modulatory effects on intestinal and systemic immune responses in animal models providing the basis for studies with vaccines in humans [72, 73, 112, 113] (Figure 2 ). However, most clinical studies conducted in children and adults generated results that varied by age, antigen, type of Ab response, and probiotic strain [19] . The mechanisms that influence vaccine performance include direct or indirect immunomodulatory actions of probiotics that have yet to be fully evaluated experimentally. Direct effects include alteration of the pathogen-associated molecular patterns presented to the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Indirect effects can be mediated by changes to the gut microbiota and immunoactive microbial metabolites such as SCFA [114] . Probiotics also affect the functions of IECs through modulation of tight junctions, increasing mucin and defensin production, inducing antimicrobial and heat shock protein production, interfering with pathogenic organisms, and modulating signaling pathways and cell survival [115] [116] [117] [118] . Certain probiotic strains have been shown to enhance Ab responses to oral vaccines against RV [35, [119] [120] [121] , Salmonella [122] , PV [123] , and Vibrio cholerae [124] in human volunteers, and this effect was observed after a short period (1-5 weeks) of probiotic treatment. The positive effect of probiotics on immune responses was also seen in parenterally administered vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, Haemophilus influenzae type B, and hepatitis B [125] [126] [127] in infants after a sixmonth period. However, no mechanistic explanations for the observed effects or detailed microbiome analysis were available from these studies.",

To further improve post-vaccine responses, new adjuvants based on particular microbiota-derived immune-modulating molecules or bioactive micronutrients should be evaluated.
