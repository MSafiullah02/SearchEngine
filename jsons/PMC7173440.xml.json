A license is required to use the PCR process.) The limit of its sensitivity is a single molecule, making PCR a superb qualitative tool for the specific detection of rare DNA sequences. Under proper conditions, the yield of amplified DNA is proportional to the initial number of target molecules, rendering it a quantitative analytical tool as well. Since its original description in 1985, PCR has evolved into an assemblage of varied methodologies almost universally used in basic biological research, biotechnology, clinical research, clinical diagnostics, forensics, food technology, environmental testing, archaeology and anthropology, and other fields. Even though other nucleic acid amplification technologies have been described, PCR remains by far the most widely used.",

            "text": "PCR involves the enzymatic synthesis of millions of copies of a specific DNA segment. The exponential amplification of a very small amount of template DNA is achieved using a heat-stable DNA polymerase and an automated heat block that is capable of rapid changes of temperature. The template DNA molecule is initially denatured to two single strands by heating to high temperature (typically 90\u201395\u00b0C) in the first stage of the PCR cycle (Figure 1A\n). Two small oligonucleotides that are complementary to sequences on opposite strands of the template molecule and that flank the DNA segment to be amplified are used as primers for the DNA polymerase. The second stage of the PCR cycle consists of cooling the reaction, which permits the annealing of the single-stranded oligonucleotide primers to the denatured template molecule (Figure 1B). The third stage of the reaction is the extension of the new strand from the annealed primer in a 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction by the heat-stable polymerase (Figure 1C). This is performed at the optimum temperature for the polymerase (68\u201372\u00b0C). The most commonly used polymerase is the enzyme isolated from Thermus aquaticus (Taq DNA polymerase). After the first cycle, each template molecule has been amplified to two molecules. These in turn are denatured in the next cycle and amplified to produce four molecules. The four molecules are amplified to eight in the third cycle, and so on. Each successive cycle effectively doubles the amount of DNA product. The three-stage cycle of denaturation, annealing, and primer extension is repeated 25\u201340 times in a typical PCR procedure. The product of such a reaction is a large quantity (10\u22129 to 10\u22128\n mol l\u22121 in a 10\u2013100 \u03bcl volume) of a double-stranded DNA molecule whose length is determined by the distance between the primer sites on the original template molecule. Typically, PCR products or amplicons are 100\u20133000 bp in length, although much longer (up to \u223c50000 bp) amplifications are possible under specific conditions. PCR products are visualized by electrophoresis followed by staining with fluorescent dyes or by hybridization to labeled oligonucleotide probes.",

In practice, this means adding \u223c1 \u03bcg of eukaryotic genomic DNA, 10 ng of yeast DNA, or 1 ng of bacterial DNA.

Concentrations between 0.1 and 1 \u03bcmol l\u22121 can be used. Higher concentrations may increase nonspecific annealing of primers and thus to nonspecific amplification products. PCR primers are normally between 18 and 30 nucleotides in length and should preferably have a guanine+cytosine (G+C) content of \u223c50%. The temperature at which half the DNA molecules will be double-stranded, T\nm, in degree celsius, for a primer is estimated by the rule-of-thumb equation: 2\u00d7(number of As and Ts)+4\u00d7number of Gs and Cs) (A=adenine, T=thymine). However, more accurate calculation of oligonucleotide T\nm requires consideration of the effects of ionic strength and neighboring bases in the DNA strand (nearest neighbor T\nm calculation methods). Software is available for performing these calculations. The T\nm values for the two primers in a reaction should be similar, and the annealing temperature used is normally \u223c5\u00b0C below the T\nm. As annealing temperature approaches T\nm, more specific amplifications are achieved, but overall yields may decrease. Despite careful calculations, empirical testing of annealing temperatures is essential for a well-optimized PCR assay. Complementarity at the 3\u2032 ends of primer pairs should be avoided as this promotes the formation of primer oligomers (primer dimers). Such artifactual products are themselves templates for PCR amplification and compete with the desired products for deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), polymerase, and primers. This leads to a decreased yield of the desired product and the presence of nonspecific products that may complicate analysis.",

            "text": "A primer oligomer forms when two or more primers anneal to each other and are extended during PCR. The double-stranded product acts as a template during subsequent rounds of amplification and competes with the desired product. In general, low annealing temperatures, high enzyme concentrations, and high primer concentrations increase the probability of primer oligomerization. However, it is stringency during the initial cycle of PCR that is most critical for primer oligomer formation, as well as for nonspecific PCR products in general. Various techniques for maintaining high stringency up until the point when primers and enzyme are mixed together have been described (generally called Hot Start). Hot Start methods involve mixing of enzyme and primers only after reactions have reached a stringent temperature. A simple technique for Hot Start is manual addition of a small volume (typically 5\u201310 \u03bcl) of reaction buffer containing the enzyme to the other components maintained in the thermal cycler at \u223c80\u00b0C, then continuing with standard PCR amplification. Another method involves sealing a portion of the amplification reaction under wax, then adding the remaining reactants above the wax barrier. Enzymatic methods to accomplish the same goal include the use of a modified DNA polymerase that is blocked with a thermolabile group or the use of uracil DNA glycosylase (uracil-N-glycosylase, UNG), deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP), and a brief initial incubation at 50\u00b0C. Typically, dUTP is substituted on an equimolar basis for deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) (200 \u03bcmol l\u22121), but higher concentrations of dUTP (125\u2013300 \u03bcmol l\u22121) may be beneficial in some assays. Uracil DNA glycosylase is used at 1\u20132 Units per reaction. This method ensures that any nonspecific product or primer oligomer that is generated during the initial low-stringency conditions will contain uracil (U) and therefore be susceptible to cleavage by UNG. Uracil is excised during the 50\u00b0C incubation, and strand breakage occurs at these abasic sites during the initial denaturation step. In addition to inactivating any contaminating amplicons, this method reduces nonspecific products and primer oligomer. Because residual UNG can degrade the U-containing amplicons, PCR products must be analyzed immediately or stored at 4\u00b0C for short periods of time or frozen for longer times. Alternately, UNG can be removed by extraction with organic solvents or digested with proteases.",

Internal sequences are less critical. Provided a suitable annealing temperature is used, degenerate primers (primers that consist of a pool of different but closely related oligonucleotides) may be used to ensure that primers will anneal to highly variable sequences or sequences that are only partially known. These primers are designed from amino acid sequences or from a comparison of similar genes from other organisms. Sequences at the 5\u2032 end of the primer are least critical. Providing the hybridizing portion of the primer is long enough to ensure annealing to the template DNA, nonhomologous 5\u2032 extensions (regions that do not correspond to the sequence of the template) can be used to introduce restriction enzyme sites into PCR products to be cloned or to add other sequences such as phage RNA polymerase promoters.",

Each incubation step is a segment, and a complete round of denaturation, annealing, and extension is a cycle. First, samples are heated to a temperature adequate to melt the double-stranded DNA template and any secondary structure in the primers. Denaturation is most commonly performed at 94\u00b0C, although temperatures of 97\u201399\u00b0C may be required for templates with high GC content. After the first several cycles, denaturation temperature can be lowered to 90\u201392\u00b0C to reduce loss of polymerase activity through heat denaturation during the course of PCR. Next, samples are cooled to an annealing temperature at which the primers will hybridize to their target sequences. The choice of annealing temperature depends on primer T\nm, but is usually in the range of 50\u201360\u00b0C. Finally, the samples are heated to the extension temperature (68\u201372\u00b0C). If primers are designed to permit efficient annealing at 60\u201368\u00b0C, the annealing and extension steps can be combined into one step.

Real-time instruments are designed to monitor fluorescence from labels whose emission intensity is proportional to the amount of amplified DNA. Flexibility varies greatly among the available machines, but all instruments can measure fluorescence at least once during the annealing segment of every cycle. Intercalating dyes such as ethidium bromide or SYBR Green that are selective for double-stranded DNA provide the simplest method. Probes that hybridize adjacent to one another on one strand of the amplicon can be designed to have a fluorescence energy transfer donor and acceptor that will be close enough for energy transfer if and only if hybridization occurs. Emission from the hybridized donor- and acceptor-labeled probes is monitored during each cycle. A third approach is to use the 5\u2032 nuclease activity of Taq DNA polymerase to cleave a probe labeled with a fluorophore and a quencher. When Taq DNA polymerase (and some, but not all, other heat-stable polymerases) encounters the probe, it cuts it, dissociating the fluorophore and quencher. As with energy transfer methods, amplification is detectable as an increase in fluorescence. In addition to monitoring fluorescence, real-time thermal cyclers provide data analysis for quantitation of initial template concentration.

The fidelity of the DNA polymerase in a PCR reaction determines the similarity between the sequence of the PCR product and the original template. Taq DNA polymerase sometimes incorporates an incorrect base in the growing DNA strand, and this error is propagated during subsequent rounds of cycling. The higher the fidelity, the more closely the sequence of the PCR product reflects the sequence of the original DNA template. A range of DNA polymerases is commercially available, and certain enzymes have demonstrably higher fidelity. In addition to intrinsic differences among the various heat-stable polymerases, fidelity is influenced by a number of factors. It is therefore possible to increase or decrease the number of mismatches between the product and initial template. Conditions of low fidelity may be chosen to introduce random point mutations into a PCR product. More general applications benefit from accurate amplification. Fidelity is improved by keeping polymerase, dNTP, and MgCl2 concentrations as low as practical, using the same concentrations of each of the four dNTPs, maintaining an annealing temperature near the T\nm of the primers, and programming a short extension segment and as few cycles as practical.",

Re-amplification of previously amplified DNA is a major problem for PCR. To reduce the likelihood of contamination of reagents, separate laboratory work areas should be designated for reagent preparation, sample preparation, reaction assembly and thermal cycling, and post-PCR analysis. Depending on the analytical rigor required and the resources available, well-isolated rooms for each step of the process will be beneficial. In the research laboratory, however, it is more common to rely on separate work areas and equipment for pre- and postamplification work and gowning of laboratory personnel in cleanroom garments. Laboratory equipment, especially pipettors and shared equipment, and laboratory personnel are the most common sources of PCR product contamination. Clinical laboratories or other analytical laboratories now employ physical separation of work areas and equipment in addition to a biochemical method using the enzyme uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG) to prevent amplicon contamination. If PCR reactions are performed with dUTP rather than dTTP, amplicons will be susceptible to digestion by UNG. This method has been called PCR sterilization. The need to avoid contamination with amplified DNA constitutes an incentive to use real-time PCR for qualitative as well as quantitative assays. With real-time PCR, tubes containing amplified DNA need never be opened. No matter what precautions are taken, negative controls containing no DNA template must always be included with each batch of PCR reactions.

Reverse transcriptases from Maloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV-RT) or avian myeloblastoma virus (AMV-RT) are commonly used. Either the buffer optimal for the reverse transcription (RT) or the PCR buffer is suitable in most cases, and reverse transcription is typically performed at 37\u201342\u00b0C for 15\u201360 min. Because these enzymes are heat-labile, they are inactivated during the first denaturation segment of PCR. Heat-stable reverse transcriptases enable reverse transcription at higher temperatures to denature RNA secondary structure. In the presence of Mn2+, some DNA-dependent DNA polymerases such as the enzyme from Thermus thermophilus (Tth DNA polymerase) have activity on RNA templates. Using MnCl2 for reverse transcription can enable cDNA synthesis with the same enzyme used for PCR. Unless a balance between MnCl2 and MgCl2 is carefully identified, Mn2+ must be removed or chelated, and Mg2+ must be added prior to PCR. RT-PCR can be performed within intact cells (in situ PCR) to identify cells expressing particular genes or to assess the presence of disease-related genes. Thermal cyclers are available to automate the process on microscope slides.",

Bacteria that are difficult or impossible to culture on artificial media can now be detected by PCR. The causative organism of syphilis, Treponema pallidum, can be detected by a PCR assay in which a gene encoding a specific membrane protein is amplified. PCR is being employed to investigate the pathogenicity of Mycoplasma genitalium. As few as four organisms can be detected by this method. PCR-based detection assays have also been developed for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, an organism that takes up to several weeks to identify by conventional means owing to its slow growth on artificial media. M. tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis, infects about one-third of the world's population and is most prevalent in developing countries. Recently, this organism has re-emerged as a significant pathogen in the developed world, especially among the poor and homeless, and antibiotic-resistant strains are developing.

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is responsible for AIDS, is currently detected primarily by immunological means. However, as with most viral infections, it takes some time following infection for antibodies to develop, and there is therefore a period when a patient infected with the virus would appear negative by conventional tests. A PCR assay can be used to detect the presence of the virus in this case. Proviral DNA that has integrated into the genomes of leucocytes can be detected, or the viral RNA genome can be detected in plasma by RT-PCR. Identification of HIV by PCR methods has played an important role in AIDS diagnostics and research, as well as improved safety testing in blood banks. PCR assays have also been used in epidemiological studies and in the identification of other retroviruses such as human T-lymphotropic virus types 1 and 2 (HTLV-1 and HTLV-2). PCR procedures have also been developed to detect human papillomaviruses. This diverse group of viruses can cause a number of diseases. A PCR assay can distinguish the relatively harmless strains from those that cause serious diseases such as cervical cancer. Current laboratory methods for the diagnosis of human enteroviruses, which cause infection in children, are slow and lack sensitivity. Detection is hindered by the low level of viruses present in clinical specimens. PCR technology, however, provides a rapid and accurate diagnostic test. PCR assays have also been used to detect coronaviruses, cytomegalovirus, human herpesvirus type 6, adenovirus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, rotaviruses, human parvovirus, and herpes simplex viruses, among many others. In addition to detection, PCR assays can be designed to differentiate between different strains or serotypes of a particular virus.",

Despite the simplicity and rapidity of PCR from the perspective of the research laboratory, it is viewed as a complex test in the clinical laboratory.

DNA sequencing, high-resolution size analysis on sequencing gels, single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, Southern blotting and probe hybridization, allele-specific oligonucleotide probes, and other techniques are used to test for the presence of mutations. This approach has been used to detect mutations causing diseases such as sickle cell anemia, beta-thalassemia, cystic fibrosis, and many others. Genetic diseases caused by trinucleotide repeat expansion can be tested using PCR followed by high-resolution electrophoretic analysis on sequencing gels. A commercial test for fragile X syndrome employs novel PCR reagents and thermal cycling conditions to enable amplification of (CGG) repeats up to 800 repeat units in length in the same reaction containing a normal allele (usually 29\u201331 repeat units). In general, PCR should be considered a versatile template onto which can be superimposed known DNA sequences for any disorder, whether genetic or infectious in nature, to rapidly configure a high-performance test.",

If the option to terminate a pregnancy is taken, this time savings can be of enormous benefit. The availability of PCR technology creates an incentive for the development of noninvasive prenatal sampling techniques. Because amniocentesis and CVS carry a certain amount of risk, less invasive sampling procedures are desirable. A small number of cells of fetal origin circulate in the maternal blood. Methods to purify these cells have been described. Mutations and polymorphisms on the Y chromosome already can be tested using maternal blood samples without the need to purify fetal cells.

To determine which bacterial colony contains the plasmid of interest, transformant colonies can be analyzed by PCR using primers designed from the vector (plasmid) DNA, bracketing the insert. In this way, colonies can be screened to find one containing a plasmid with an insert of a particular size, obviating the need to screen transformants by plasmid DNA preparation followed by restriction enzyme digestion. PCR can also be used to screen libraries for clones containing a particular DNA fragment or gene. This strategy dispenses with the filter hybridization step and can be both quicker and more sensitive than traditional methods. PCR is also invaluable in mutagenesis, radioactive, and nonradioactive labeling of DNA fragments, and many other applications.
