In 2018, 11.1% of American households were considered food insecure at some point in the year, and 4.3% experienced very low food security, characterized by disrupted eating patterns and reduced food intake. 3 Food insecurity is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes, including chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary heart disease, depression, and mental health challenges and increased risk of mortality.

            "text": "Food insecurity tracks closely with national and household economic conditions, with trends paralleling unemployment, poverty, and food prices. 3, 10, 11 Given the unprecedented rise in U.S. unemployment since mid-March 2020 12 , models based on data from the 2007-2008 recession predict significant and rapid increases in food insecurity. 13 Food insecurity is not just a consequence of an inability to afford food, however. The COVID-19 pandemic affects all dimensions of food security, defined by the United Nations to include food availability, accessibility, utilization, and stability. 2 Food availability has shifted in the short term by consumer panic shopping, but longer-term availability challenges may also unfold. The COVID-19 pandemic threatens accessibility to food through effects on food costs and infrastructure, including changes in food assistance distribution, public transit access, and shortages of certain products. In terms of utilization, market reports indicate widespread changes in food purchasing behaviors. 14, 15 There are few, if any, peer-reviewed studies using empirical evidence to document actual changes in food insecurity due to COVID-19. Using statewide survey data from Vermont, a U.S. state with a predominantly rural population, 16 we describe the impact of COVID-19 on household food insecurity among 3,219 Vermont respondents, including their challenges and concerns related to food access, coping strategies, and use of assistance programs, and then discuss public and individual health implications of rising food insecurity.",

Previous research 10, 11 suggests links between job loss and food insecurity, indicating that the profound increase in Americans experiencing job loss and disruption 24 will present acute and large-scale impacts across the population. Since Vermont unemployment claims reflect the national trend, these results likely reflect a broader U.S. phenomenon of rising food insecurity rates, evidenced by early non-peer reviewed studies. 25, 26 In addition to these new economic barriers, the pandemic presents many new physical barriers for food access with reductions in public transportation and new distribution models, and in a rural state like Vermont, a lack of income for transportation costs including fuel. In rural areas where food assistance programs such as food pantries are limited, closures due to illness, social distancing, or lack of volunteers may be particularly challenging. This presents opportunities to expand food pantries, support mobile pantry units, as well as encourage the expansion of programs such as fruit and vegetable prescription programs, shown to positively affect food security 27 and improve health outcomes 28 . Ultimately, this research demonstrates a need to increase food assistance programs and provide resources to remove food access barriers now, and likely in the future, during state and national economic and health emergencies.",

Screening for food insecurity and providing resources now may reduce short and long-term consequences including the potential long-term impacts on child health outcomes associated with the duration of household food insecurity 31 and higher health care expenditures associated with food insecurity 9 . The Hunger Vital Sign, a validated two-question food insecurity screening tool based on the USDA Household Food Security Survey Module 32 , can quickly determine risk for food insecurity in clinical and community settings. This tool is widely utilized, especially in pediatrics 33, 34 , and could be made standard in health care and other service settings during COVID-19 and beyond. Providers could refer families in need to locally available resources or to United Way, which aggregates these resources locally. However, during this heightened time of unemployment, there is also potential for government agencies, particularly those distributing unemployment benefits, to help connect families in need to available resources as well.",

Low rates of seeking assistance in our results, especially among newly food insecure households, may be partly related to the stigma associated with assistance programs. 35, 36 Prior research suggests that populations living outside major metropolitan areas may be more likely to utilize friends and family for support 37 and to see government assistance programs as a \"last resort\". 38 However, with social distancing and widespread financial challenges, such personal safety nets may be eroded, and these households may be particularly vulnerable. Additional research is needed to understand barriers to utilize food assistance programs, especially among those that may be newly food insecure since COVID-19.",

The limitations are partly rooted in the need to rapidly administer this survey in the early days of the pandemic, to provide data that can be tracked over time. Though our respondent population matches statewide census statistics closely on many metrics, this was a convenience sample; further research is expanding these results using similar questions with representative samples across states and populations. Further, we utilize an internet-based survey given the necessity of social distancing during COVID-19 and the need for a rapid response, which may limit the capacity of some people to participate, though 81% of Vermonters do have internet plans 23 . The study's strengths include its large sample size, early administration, population-based assessment, and survey instrument addressing the multiple dimensions of food security.",
