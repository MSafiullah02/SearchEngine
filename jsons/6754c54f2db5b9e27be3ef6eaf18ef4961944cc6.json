            "text": "Purpose Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and chest trauma are common injuries in severely injured patients. Both entities are well known to be associated with severe post-traumatic complications, including pneumonia, a common complication with a significant impact on the further clinical course. However, the relevance of TBI, chest trauma and particularly their combination as risk factors for the development of pneumonia and its impact on outcomes are not fully elucidated. Methods A retrospective analysis of poly-traumatized patients treated between 2010 and 2015 at a level I trauma centre was performed. Inclusion criteria were: Injury Severity Score \u2265 16 and age \u2265 18 years. TBI and chest trauma were classified according to the Abbreviated Injury Scale. Complications (i.e. acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and pneumonia) were documented by a review of the medical records. The primary outcome parameter was in-hospital mortality. Results Over the clinical course, 19.9% of all patients developed pneumonia, and in-hospital mortality was 25.3%. Pneumonia (OR 5.142, p = 0.001) represented the strongest independent predictor of in-hospital mortality, followed by the combination of chest injury and TBI (OR 3.784, p = 0.008) and TBI (OR 3.028, p = 0.010). Chest injury alone, the combination of chest injury and TBI, and duration of ventilation were independent predictors of pneumonia [resp. OR 4.711 (p = 0.004), OR 4.193 (p = 0.004), OR 1.002 (p < 0.001)]. Conclusions Chest trauma alone and especially its combination with TBI represent high-risk injury patterns for the development of pneumonia, which forms the strongest predictor of mortality in poly-traumatized patients.",

MODS was defined by an increased SOFA score of at least two organ systems. Pneumonia was diagnosed when the patient met the following criteria: new or progressive pulmonary infiltrates on a chest radiograph with fever (temperature > 38.3 \u00b0C) or leucocytes < 4000 cells/mm 3 or > 12,000 cells/mm 3 and at least two of the following signs: new or changed production of purulent sputum; new or worsening dyspnoea or cough; declining oxygenation or increased oxygen requirement or need for respiratory assistance [20] .

These complications were found to be associated with age, gender and overall injury severity [21] [22] [23] [24] . Pneumonia is one of the most common complications in severely injured patients, and it is supposed to represent a predisposing factor for the development of ARDS and MODS. In this context, the studies of V\u00e9csei [13] and Grubm\u00fcller [25] showed that chest trauma in poly-traumatized patients increased the complication rate (e.g. development of pneumonia, MODS, ARDS and sepsis) and consequently influenced the outcome. However, Chrysou et al. demonstrated that the severity of the chest trauma did not correlate with these complications [26] . Neither of these studies showed chest trauma to have an influence on mortality [26, 25, 13] . For TBI, several studies could show both a predictive value for the development of complications (e.g. pneumonia, ARDS, cardiac dysfunction, thromboembolic events, sepsis) and a significant impact on mortality [27, 14] , but only one of these studies [5] addressed the combination of TBI and chest trauma as a risk factor. Yet, the importance of TBI and chest trauma as the most common injuries in poly-traumatized patients and particularly of their combination as independent predictors for the development of pneumonia is not fully clarified. Further, it remains unclear whether the injury pattern itself or the development of pneumonia represents the most relevant risk factor for adverse outcomes (ARDS, MODS, mortality). Therefore, it is important to further elucidate these associations to enhance therapy strategies for severely injured patients [14] .",

In the study by Cook et al., the correlation between TBI and post-traumatic complications was based on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and not on the AIS head as in our study [31] . The GCS in trauma patients often depends on the time of evaluation and can also change during the hospital stay in patients with severe traumatic brain injury, which might explain the different findings of our study and Cook's. Further, Hui et al. described how patients sustaining a TBI often require mechanical ventilation, and they demonstrated that this mechanical ventilation increases the risk of pneumonia in these patients, not the TBI itself [32] . This corresponds with our findings.",

Hui et al. demonstrated in their study that each additional day of mechanical ventilation increased the risk of pneumonia by 7% [32] . Further, another study found that mechanical ventilation was the most powerful risk factor for in-hospital infectious complications of ICU patients after trauma, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection and ARDS [27] . The most likely reason for the high incidence of pneumonia in the trauma population is that the artificial airway, which is often required for a prolonged ( > 48 h) period in these patients [34, 35] , obliterates the natural host defences against the tracheal colonization, besides an immunity suppression induced by the injury [5, 11] .",

[38] focused on the relevance of TBI in patients with isolated head trauma and in poly-trauma patients and found no influence of pneumonia on mortality. As we found chest injuries to be more relevant for the development of post-traumatic pneumonia, the focus on TBI in the study by Zygun et al. might result in these different findings. Rello et al. [37] described a relatively low pneumonia-related mortality rate (3.1%) in a rather small cohort of severely injured patients (n = 161). As other studies with a significantly higher number of included patients (e.g. n = 1227 [33] ) also described a relevant effect of pneumonia on mortality, the size of the study population might represent an issue. Moreover, the study by Rello was performed 25 years ago, and it might be assumed that options for other potentially lethal complications (e.g. sepsis, TBI) were not as good as today, thereby resulting in a lower pneumonia-related mortality rate.",

            "text": "The duration of the post-traumatic ICU stay has been found to significantly influence the clinical course and outcome, even years after the initial trauma [38, 37, [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . Our finding that severe TBI is associated with an increased duration of both ICU treatment and mechanical ventilation in severely injured patients is supported by the literature. In this context, different studies, as well as the present study, have demonstrated that severe TBI usually is associated with prolonged recovery periods, prolonged stays on the ICU and longer durations of mechanical ventilation [46] . This has been explained by the fact that TBI is usually associated with injuries of other body regions and emergency surgical interventions, aggravating the patient's condition and prolonging their recovery [2, 47] .",

Although we also did not find a significant effect of chest trauma on the clinical course, it seems worth noting that an additional prolongation of ICU treatment and mechanical ventilation in patients with combined TBI and chest trauma was observed in our study. This underlines the relevance of chest trauma for the post-traumatic course after severe trauma.",

Focusing on the strengths, we did not lose patients in the follow-up period, as only in-hospital complications were assessed. In addition, the single-centre character might represent an advantage of this study as it excludes bias due to differences in treatment strategies in diverse hospitals. In contrast, this study is limited due to its retrospective design. Further, with 467 patients, the statistical results might be compromised compared to nationwide databases. Finally, the pathophysiology of in-hospital complications (e.g. MODS and ARDS) is multifactorial. However, the presented regression analyses in our study can only represent a statistical model focused on a limited number of included parameter. Diverse parameter that was not included in this study might also have a considerable impact on in-hospital complications.",

Although chest injury is not an independent predictor of mortality, it is an independent predictor of pneumonia and thereby may have an indirect influence on in-hospital mortality. The combination of chest injury and TBI is also an independent predictor of pneumonia. Chest trauma seems to represent a direct risk factor, whereas TBI acts as an indirect risk factor via a prolonged duration of ventilation, which is by itself an independent predictor of pneumonia in poly-traumatized patients. Based on our results, the development of strategies to prevent pneumonia and a prolonged ventilation period in severely injured patients should be prioritized in the clinical setting.",
