CRS has been shown to have an impact not just in engraftment but also in increased risk of GvHD [13, 14]. In view of the increased risk of viral reactivation, serotherapy has not been included as part of conditioning chemotherapy in any of these children which could be a probable cause for the high incidence of CRS in our cohort. IL6 inhibitor tocilizumab has been shown to be safe and effective in curbing the adverse effects associated with severe CRS [15]. There is an ongoing clinical trial NCT03533101 where tocilizumab will be administered pre-emptively prior to transplantation in the above group of patients. In our unit, we have been employing the early institution of tocilizumab at a dose of 4\u20138 mg/kg when the first features of CRS emerge which results in immediate abatement of symptoms. We have not had mortality due to CRS in our unit since the policy change.",
