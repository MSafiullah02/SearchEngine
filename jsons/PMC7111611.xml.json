This process begins with literature review and needs assessment, enabling the development of instructional objectives specifying what is to be achieved in the training, which, in turn, provides input for designing, delivering and evaluating the effectiveness of the training programme.6, 7, 8 As Fig. 1 shows, the approach is a closed-loop system. Information resulting from evaluation of training effectiveness is used to determine whether or not the training met its previously defined aims and objectives. This information provides feedback to modify future training system features by reassessing training needs, revising course objectives or altering the delivery methods. The emergency training approach is evolving continually, with results from previous programmes being used to continuously improve future training programmes.7 Thus, the purpose of this research was to describe the training process, evaluate the effectiveness of the training, and develop a participatory emergency training approach for rural public health personnel.",

The training process, content, trainers, logistics and services were recognized by participants and trainers. For example, more than 90% of participants thought that the training methods were excellent or very good, especially the case studies and role-playing exercises.

First, the analysis was limited to the personnel that were primarily engaged in disease monitoring and controlling, and laboratory and environmental health work in 84 CDCs. Second, approximately 35 trainees had participated in a follow-up survey of the control and response to avian influenza in 2007, and the follow-up results could be influenced because this most likely increased their emergency preparedness skills. Third, evaluations were based on changes over time without the use of a horizontal comparison group. Finally, the composite variable/evaluation index used may overestimate the effectiveness of training to some extent, because changes in these composite variable/evaluation indexes were affected by many factors, including emergency preparedness training. Thus, it was not possible to fully determine which changes were due to the emergency preparedness training programme and which were due to other factors. However, the fact that demographic and capability factors remained constant throughout the study provided support that the changes presented above were due to the training programme.",
