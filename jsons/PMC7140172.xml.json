By April, 2003, the epidemic had spread worldwide, affecting 3547 individuals resulting in 182 deaths.1 In March, 2003, the putative cause of SARS was identified as a new coronavirus.2, 3 Oropharyngeal specimens from patients with SARS induced a cytopathic effect on Vero E6 tissue culture cells and revealed the presence of coronavirus-like particles. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis with random or broadly-specific coronavirus primers amplified a DNA fragment that resembled, but was distinct from, known coronavirus genomes. When tested, these diagnostic PCR methods detected the SARS virus in many clinical samples taken from affected patients. In addition, serological evidence has shown the presence of antibodies specific to the new coronavirus in the serum of patients with SARS.4 Collectively, these data strongly implicate the new coronavirus as the cause of SARS, which we designate as SARS-CoV.",

Some coronavirus infections in people, cattle, and birds cause respiratory disease, whereas other coronavirus infections in rodents, cats, pigs, and cattle lead to enteric disease. The 27\u201332 kb genomes of coronaviruses, the largest of RNA viruses, encode 23 putative proteins, including four major structural proteins; nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), membrane (M), and small envelope (E). The spike protein, a glycoprotein projection on the viral surface, is crucial for viral attachment and entry into the host cell. In addition, variations of S protein among strains of coronavirus are responsible for host range and tissue tropism.5 Differences in virulence of mice coronaviruses have also been linked to genetic variance in the S protein.6, 7 and the serological response in the host is typically raised against the S protein.8 However, the S, M, and N mature proteins all contribute to generating the host immune response as seen in transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus,9 infectious bronchitis virus,10, 11 pig respiratory coronavirus,12 and mouse hepatitis virus.13\n",

We used 13 of the samples (we excluded sample BJ04 because of substantial missing sequence information) and restricted our attention to 26 140 loci at which nucleotides were determined in all 13 samples. The null hypothesis was that the nucleotides at these loci were obtained by mutating a single consensus sequence independently at random at each position of each sequence. The mutation rate was estimated from the data by the fraction of positions in the various genomes that differed from the consensus sequence obtained by taking the most frequent nucleotide at each position. We also tested a weaker null hypothesis, in which the mutations taking place at any given locus in different samples are independent, but arbitrary dependence between the loci is possible subject to this constraint.

These sequences showed that the genomes of SARS-CoV isolated in Singapore are comprised of 29 711 bases, with the exception of a five-nucleotide deletion in strain SIN2748 and a six-nucleotide deletion in SIN2677. Initial BLAST analysis suggested that the Singapore SARS virus is similar to, but distinct from, the group 2 coronaviruses in the Coronaviridae family of enveloped and positive-stranded RNA viruses. As in the recently sequenced SARS-CoV (HKU39849, CUHK-W1, TOR2, and URBANI), the Singapore SARS virus contains 11 predicted open reading frames that encode 23 putative mature proteins with known and unknown functions. Most of the non-structural proteins seem to be encoded in the first half of the genome including nsp 1 and nsp2, with putative proteinase function and nsp9 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, whereas most of the structural proteins such as spike, membrane, envelop, and nucleocapsid are located in the second half of the genome (figure 1\n, webfigure: http://image.thelancet.com/extras/03art4454webfigure.pdf). The haemagglutinin esterase, which is common in the group 2 coronavirus, is missing in the SARS-CoV genome, suggesting that some of the non-structural genes are dispensable in coronaviruses.",

Mutations that might have been artifacts of cell culture would occur only once in our survey, whereas sequence variants associated with common ancestry should be seen in multiple isolates. Of the 127 sequence variations in the 14 isolates, 16 variant loci were identified in two or more isolates, and eight were seen in three or more isolates (figure 3\n). With the more stringent criterion, four loci recurred five or more times in the 14 SARS-CoVs analysed: C/T polymorphisms at position 9404 resulting in a valine to alanine change in orf1 a (nsp 1); position 19 084 leading to an isoleucine to threonine change in orf1ab (nsp 11); position 22 222 changing an isoleucine residue to threonine in the S 1 portion of the spike protein, and position 27 827 which is in a non-coding region (figure 3). In addition, a T/G polymorphism is noted at position 17 564 changing orf1ab (nsp 10, helicase domain) from an aspartic acid to a glutamic acid. Sequence variants at these four loci segregate together as a specific genotype. For example, isolates CUHKW1, GZDI, BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, BJ04 all have the configuration C:G:C:C at those nucleotide positions, whereas isolates SIN2500, SIN2774, SIN2679, SIN2677, TOR2, URBANI, HKU39849 have the configuration T:T:T:T (figure 3). Assuming that all base substitutions were random events propagated in the Vero cells, the probability of four specific nucleotide changes occurring concurrently is very low. The significance is at p<10\u221260 when the null hypothesis is that each locus in each sample mutates independently, and p<1015 when dependence is allowed among the loci. The C:G:C:C and T:T:T:T genotypes are, therefore, very unlikely to have emerged by chance, and might be evidence for the first genetic signature of strain differences in the SARS virus. All isolates with the T:T:T:T genotype were linked to infection acquired at the Hotel M in Hong Kong,18 whereas none of the C:G:C:C genotype isolates had this association (figure 3). Phylogenetic analysis based on the common variant sequences (defined as present in two or more isolates) confirmed that the cases associated with exposure in the Hotel M formed a cluster that was distinct from the other isolates (figure 4\n). On the basis of the molecular and contact history, we have reconstructed a probable lineage map of the SARS-CoV infections investigated here (figure 5\n).",

Although all nine isolates from outside Singapore showed a C at this position, four of the five isolates from Singapore had a T.
