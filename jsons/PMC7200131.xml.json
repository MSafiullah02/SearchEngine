Vaccinations are crucial for these patients, and the international guidelines highlight the need to assess their vaccination status in their initial diagnostic work-up [14,15].

There is evidence showing that IBD patients have impaired innate mucosal immunity, but they should not be considered as having altered immunocompetence per se. The current guidelines recommend screening patients who have to start immunosuppressive or biological therapy for some, but not all viruses: for example, screening for HBV, HCV and HIV is recommended, but screening for herpes simplex virus (HSV), Epstein Barr virus (EBV), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) is not, although it is recommended that patients should be vaccinated against VZV using inactivated vaccine before starting any immunomodulatory therapy because of the greater risk of developing severe viral infection [12]. Given that there is no vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19, it seems that the only preventive measure that could be taken is to discontinued immunosuppressive treatment while bearing the associated risks in mind.",

It is generally not recommended to change treatments or increase the doses of immunosuppressants in epidemic areas unless it is really necessary, but temporary discontinuation can be considered provided that the risk of relapse is taken into account [39]. If it is suspected that a patient receiving immunosuppressive or biological treated is undergoing a relapse with fever and needs to be seen as outpatient, treatment should be discontinued if COVID-19 cannot be ruled out. Patients with biological agents who are at low risk of relapse, such as those in long-term and stable clinical remission, can postpone the infusion, although those at high risk should continue. It is also necessary to remember that, although the risk of a relapse of CD and UC during the first year after the withdrawal of a biological drug or immunosuppressant is 20\u201350%, it is less for shorter periods of discontinuation (albeit unpredictably so), which means that the risk needs to be assessed before postponing an infusion. In the absence of precise and objective diagnostic instruments that can help decision making (e.g. an endoscopic evaluation of mucosal healing), it is possible to rely on calprotectin or CRP levels. Finally, the factors favouring a reduced risk of relapse are immunomodulatory co-treatment, the absence of complex perianal or severe rectal disease, no history of intestinal or colonic stricture, intra-abdominal abscesses or fistulae, and a limited extent of the disease in the past [40]. In the absence of these, it is wiser not to stop biological treatment.",

Another raising question if as whether these drugs can be used to prevent COVID-19. Given the lack of scientific evidence, the Italian Society of Infectious and Tropical Diseases (SIMIT) has pronounced against this possibility [3] and we believe that, even though they have a good safety profile, it is necessary to evaluate them further in clinical trials.",

On the basis of this, a number of trials are evaluating the possibility of using tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor blocker licensed for RA and cytokine release syndrome, to treat COVID-19 at an expected dose of 8 mg/kg to be repeated after 12 h. A multicenter RCT approved in China currently involves patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and high IL- 6 levels (ChiCTR2000029765), and a phase II and a phase III studies have been approved by the Italian Drug Regulatory Agency (AIFA) for patients with pneumonia and early respiratory failure that has a one-month reduction in mortality as its primary outcome (TOCIVID-19).",

IFN is also one of the most potent innate immune responses preventing viral replication during the early phases of infection [56]. As a selective inhibitor of JAK-1 and JAK-2, baricitinib can dampen the host inflammatory response to the cytokine storm (including IL-6 and IFN-gamma) responsible for the more severe forms of interstitial pneumonia during COVID-19 [57].",
