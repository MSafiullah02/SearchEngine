            "text": "Ecotones, the edges or transition zones between two adjacent ecological systems are frequently mentioned in the zoonotic and vector-borne disease literature. They are used to describe field study or sampling locations (Bennett et al., 1999; Townsend et al., 2003; Eisen et al., 2004) and features of possible surveillance value using remote sensing (Wilson, 2002b). Some recent field studies have suggested ecotones as habitats where rates of infectious parasitic diseases in wildlife are high and may increase due to climate-driven shifts in ecotones (Svobodova et al., 2004). Studies in Europe and North America have shown tick vectors of a number of significant zoonotic infectious diseases are most abundant in these ecotones (Goddard, 1997; Lindstrom and Jaenson, 2003; Pietzsch et al., 2005). Mosquitoes responsible for the transmission of encephalitis virus have been found to congregate at ecotones (Lothrop et al., 2002), and populations of competent rodent reservoirs (white-footed mouse) for Lyme disease preferentially inhabit ecotones (LoGiudice et al., 2003). Ecotones have been identified as potentially important for some eukaryotic parasites in terms of host seeking (Burg, 2001) and host switching (Hoberg et al., 2002). The pathogen\u2019s themselves may concentrate in their host populations at ecotones as is apparent for some arboviruses (Yuill, 1986). Bradley (2004) briefly summarized the history of ecotones in epidemiology with regard to their significance in providing specialized habitat for hosts or vectors, as the interface between human settlements and natural ecosystems, and where humans come in contact with a \u201cnew\u201d ecosystem. However, his focus was on an analogous concept he coined \u201cchronotones,\u201d and their potential for contributing to understanding disease outbreaks and control measures targeting environmental factors. Yet the role of ecotones as a factor contributing to the global EID phenomenon has not been critically examined taking into account the synthesis based on a re-examination of ecotones based by landscape ecologists (Holland et al., 1991; Hansen and Di Castri, 1992; Risser, 1995). In this article, we briefly summarize this expanded view of ecotones and consider the evidence based on a review of the literature and EID reports for the role of ecotones in infectious disease emergence on this basis.",

They were viewed as relatively static zones and landscape boundaries favored as habitat by some species and crossed by other species encroaching \u201calien\u201d habitat or ecosystems. In the new synthesis (Holland et al., 1991; Hansen and Di Castri, 1992; Risser, 1995), ecotones are described as dynamic and more complex constituents of ecological systems that influence biodiversity and ecosystem function disproportionately to their geographic extent, and all spatial scales. This new synthetic view has been substantiated by theoretical and empirical studies (Smith et al., 1997; Fagan et al., 1999).",

            "text": "The principle conclusion of this body of research is that ecotones can now be described as areas where biophysical factors, biological activity, and ecological evolutionary processes are concentrated and intensified. This includes biological productivity, genetic diversification, evolutionary adaptation, interspecific interactions, and the aggregation and movement of organisms, nutrients, and other materials (Risser, 1995), although a single ecotone may not exhibit all these characteristics (Walker et al., 2003). Another dimension of this rethinking of ecotones is their description as representing a spatial hierarchy (Gosz, 1991, 1993). Thus, an ecotone can be considered the boundary at an individual plant\u2019s edge or a small vegetation patch (on the scale of meters or hectares) to a landscape type (on the scale of 104 to 106 hectares) or that determined by the transition zone between two biomes (a regional scale of 103+ Km2). This biome, or regional scale ecotone consists of a landscape \u201cmosaic\u201d of patches varying in type, number, size, inter-patch distance, and juxtaposition. Its ecotone characteristics reflect a spectrum of patch ecotonal and inter-patch processes depending on the microclimate, soil chemistry, flora and fauna, as well as larger scale abiotic and biotic factors, including human influences across all of these scales.",

Such ecotones now dominate much of the geography of the world\u2019s tropical developing regions where land use change and forest conversion has been occurring at historically unprecedented rates in the past three decades (Meyer and Turner, 1994; Lambin et al., 2003). Human-created ecotones now extend across entire regions, superimposed on and expanding into natural ecotones, as well as extending deep into formerly intact blocks of continuous forest. Much of the formerly huge block of tropical rain forest extending across equatorial, central, and East Africa has been eroded to a point where all but the core area in central Africa can be described as basically a regional scale ecotone. Population growth and pressure on natural resources has similarly transformed Southeast Asia in recent decades such that zones representing ecotones are now far more extensive than intact forest blocks. This may limit the original utility of the term (edge habitat has become virtually ubiquitous) on this scale. But it emphasizes how processes formerly constrained geographically are now widespread.",

We attempted to test this hypothesis by searching the peer reviewed literature for relevant information on the list of 130 zoonotic EIDs assembled by Taylor et al. (2001), recently updated by Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria (2005). We reviewed the readily accessible (electronically searchable) literature on each disease for information describing the locations, ecological circumstances, and factors reported to have contributed to emergence events. Consistent with the definition of an EID (Lederberg et al., 2003), we attempted to determine whether or not the source or appearance of a new or more virulent variant of a pathogen, infection event, outbreak or epidemic(s), dispersal or geographic spread of a pathogen has been or still is associated with an ecotone. In addition, we attempted to further determine whether specific ecotonal processes are suggested. For some diseases, an association with ecotones is well-know and has been explicitly described (e.g., Yellow fever and Lyme disease). However, neither this terminology nor other technically precise landscape ecological terminology, or technically precise ecological terminology in general is used in the zoonotic disease literature. So whether or not an association with ecotones and specific ecotonal processes exists can only be inferred for many diseases. For most, however, pertinent descriptive information, regardless of its technical precision, currently is lacking altogether.",

Such information, particularly that definitively showing ecotone involvement or not, is generally sparse except for the most thoroughly studied diseases. We found 10 EIDs for which, in our judgment, sufficient information exists and research has been conducted to assess whether or not ecotones contribute to their emergence, at least over a significant part of the diseases\u2019 geographic range. Ecotones and ecotonal processes are associated with the emergence of all the viral diseases in Table 2 and one of the bacterial diseases (Lyme disease). For the remaining four diseases, ecotones appear to play a somewhat less important but still significant role. For example, cholera has an oral\u2013fecal transmission mode but the pathogen\u2019s dispersal in the environment often involves aquatic\u2013terrestrial ecotonal processes.

They differ in that waterbirds and wetland habitat are involved in former while non-water birds but irrigation systems providing vector habitat apparently have been important in the latter\u2019s emergence.

For others, like Ebola, Monkeypox, and Marburg, listed as similar to rabies, the data is very sparse, the evidence is weaker, and the similarity is less obvious.

Its ecology and epidemiology has been well described since the mid-1950s and it serves as a classic example of a vector-borne EID associated with an ecotone. The virus is maintained endemically among canopy dwelling monkey species and forest mosquito transmission cycles and may emerge in areas in which human settlement has encroached along the forest fringes, and whose proximal habitations or plantations (e.g., banana) may support domestic and peri-domestic Aedes spp. of mosquitoes. The mixing of densely populated host and vector species facilitates the efficiency virus transmission, and disease outbreaks frequently occur successively at multiple points along riverine forests. Dengue is a related arboviral disease that has historically shared similar host, vectors, and ecological niche that is now transmissible in the absence of non-human primate cycles. Yet this disease is believed to have originally emerged as a result of the virus\u2019 successful shift from forest mosquito species to domestic and peri-domestic mosquito species. Data are insufficient to determine whether or not sylvatic dengue still spills over to peri-domesic transmission cycles.

A number of other rodent-borne EIDs potentially can be explained by this or similar ecological mechanisms, although limited or no ecological research has been conducted. Rodents are well-know to frequently undergo what ecologists call \u201cecological release\u201d when forest edge and clearings, as well as cropland, is created. In addition, human settlements provide abundant nesting, feeding, and breed sites for rodents and arthropods. Both groups have numerous species apparently pre-adapted to peri-domestic or domestic circumstances, often involving amplification of transmission via domestic animals. Thus arboviral EIDs such as Rift Valley fever, and Venuzuelan Equine Encephalitis probably are ecotone associated. Nipah virus is a clearly documented example of amplification via agricultural encroachment into tropical forest; in this case for the dual purpose of establishing mango plantations and the raising of pigs (Olival and Daszak, 2005).",

Pigs may be involved as an intermediary step in a number of these instances including Nipah, Influenza, and Japanese Encephalitis. Spillover may also occur in both directions as illustrated by infectious agents as diverse as Echinococcus granulosus, Bacillus anthracis, Mycobacterium bovis, Rift Valley fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and Kyasunur Forest virus. Animals congregate in ecotones, facilitating spillover. Possibly the best example is avian influenza, involving the mixing of three different communities: wild migratory waterfowl, wild local birds (and possible other vertebrates), and domestic fowl (chickens, geese, and ducks). In this case, all three of the above factors may combine to facilitate emergence. These affects may be further multiplied by the geographic convergence of aquatic\u2013terrestrial ecotone with multiple types of human-created ecotones, further intensifying ecotonal processes. Nutrient pollution, degradation of riparian habitat with associated loss of ecological functions that normally assimilate nutrients and pathogens, combined with concentration of domestic fowl and their waste are commonly associated with human settlement/aquatic\u2013terrestrial ecotones. Added to this is the tendency for human land use, particular that associated with urbanization, to increase the variety and amount of runoff along with more erratic hydrology (Allen, 2004). Virtually all of the waterborne EIDs arguably are at least in part associated with aquatic\u2013terrestrial ecotonal processes, of which cholera and leptospirosis are well documented. Cholera (V. cholerae, V. vulnificus, and V. parahaemolyticus) is associated both with the land\u2013ocean ecotone (estuary), since marine crustaceans are their natural reservoirs, and terrestrial\u2013freshwater ecotones where human settlement and rivers or wetlands converge as describe above.",
