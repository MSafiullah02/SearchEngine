(65%).7, 8 In contrast, the overall case fatality rate reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) was 30%.2 The main difference between the patients in our cohort and the overall cases reported by the WHO is age; the median age of our cohort was 62 years compared to 47 years in the WHO report.2 Furthermore, we found age \u226565 years to be the only independent risk factor for mortality. This underscores the importance of age, not only as a risk factor for acquiring MERS-CoV infection, but also as an important predictor of MERS-CoV-related mortality. Our finding is similar to that reported by Breban et al.,18 but different from the report of Assiri et al.,3 who found no association between older age and the risk of mortality.",
