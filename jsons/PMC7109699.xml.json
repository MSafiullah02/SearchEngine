The bacteria colonize the small intestine of the pig by binding with their F4 fimbriae to specific receptors and produce enterotoxins, inducing diarrhea (Jones and Rutter, 1972; Alexander, 1994). The F4 fimbriae, composed of major and minor subunit structures, exist in 3 serological variants, namely F4ab, F4ac, and F4ad (Orskov et al., 1964; Guinee and Jansen, 1979; Mooi and de Graaf, 1985). These variants differ in the amino acid composition of the major fimbrial subunit FaeG, which has adhesive properties and recognizes glycoconjugates on the surface of enterocytes (Kearns and Gibbons, 1979; Sellwood, 1980; Bakker et al., 1992; Van den Broeck et al., 1999a). Although different F4 receptor profiles were observed due to different F4 ETEC adhesion phenotypes, no causal mutation in previous proposed candidate genes has yet been identified (Ren et al., 2012; reviewed in Schroyen et al., 2012).",

Residual DNA was removed with an on-column deoxyribonuclease (DNase) treatment. The concentration of total RNA (between 400 and 1,600 ng/\u03bcL) and the optical density (OD)260/280 ratio for purity (between 2.09 and 2.14) were measured by the Nanodrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Isogen Life Science, De Meern, The Netherlands). Ribonucleic acid quality was assessed by comparison of the 28S and the 18S ribosomal bands from 1 \u03bcg of total RNA on a 0.8% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. All RNA samples were confirmed to be DNA free by a minus reverse transcriptase (RT\u2013) PCR with Sus scrofa (Sscr) ANPEP \u00b1 5 primers on 20 ng RNA (Supplementary Table 1).

Ten of the RR pigs (41.67%) became seropositive and showed adhesion towards F4ab/ac ETEC.

It has been described that oral administration of F4ac antigens to F4R\u2013 pigs (based on the in vitro villous adhesion test) can prime the immune system resulting in a secondary antibody response following a subsequent intramuscular immunization (Van den Broeck et al., 2002). Looking at the F4-specific serum IgA response of these piglets 7 d after boosting a weaker response occurred (from a titer of 7 to 30), in comparison with F4R+ piglets (titer increased until 43).

Previously, it has been shown that ANPEP is a functional cell surface receptor for group I coronaviruses and that this interaction is dependent on species-specific amino acid differences in the receptor protein (Delmas et al., 1992, 1994; Yeager et al., 1992; Tresnan et al., 1996; Benbacer et al., 1997; Li et al., 2007; Tusell et al., 2007). For instance, a T742V or a T742R substitution in feline ANPEP, a common receptor for group I coronaviruses, abrogated the receptor activity for feline enteric coronavirus, canine coronavirus, and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (Tresnan and Holmes, 1998; Tusell et al., 2007).",
