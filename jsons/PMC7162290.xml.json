Several explanations may account for this outcome. First, the small size of PSB and TBB and the strict definitions for bacterial, viral, and fungal pneumonia could explain why a higher diagnostic yield was not attained in the present study, despite the use of a wide range of molecular diagnostic tests. Second, all patients received empirical antimicrobial therapy prior to FB, which had the potential to decrease the diagnostic yield.",

First, bacterial and fungal infections are the primary causes of infection during neutropenic period, while viral infections are more common during the mid\u2010 and late\u2010recovery phases after HSCT.4, 5, 6, 9, 11 Majority of patients in our study were non\u2010neutropenic. Second, compared with previous studies, we used PCR to detect 27 viruses, which greatly improved the diagnosis of viruses and allowed the early administration of appropriate therapies. However, these assays were not available during the previous study periods. The results demonstrate that PCR is a fast and effective diagnostic method for viruses. In our study, CMV was the most common pathogen found, which is in agreement with previous studies,7, 16 followed by RSV and parainfluenza virus.",

In accordance with previous studies, the threshold value for positive BAL GM in our study was 0.5.6, 19 PJP was found in a relatively high percentage (12%). In our study, the diagnosis of PJP was confirmed by PCR in 8/9 (89%) cases, which confirmed that PCR was relatively sensitive for the detection of P. jirovecii. In addition to the gold standard method of direct visualization of the pathogen, PCR was employed in the current study for the detection of P. jirovecii DNA in BAL and to establish the diagnosis of PJP. Indeed, the direct visualization was positive only in one of nine patients ultimately diagnosed with PJP. The PJP cases with positive PCR and negative smear probably did not represent colonization, since the characteristic clinical and radiological picture of PJP was observed in high\u2010risk patients. Moreover, a previous study confirmed the PCR assay to be relatively sensitive and highly specific for the detection of P. jirovecii (74% and 95%, respectively), with a low false\u2010positive rate and a positive predictive value of 83%.20\n",
