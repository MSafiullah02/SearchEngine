            "text": "An appreciation of the protective power conferred by immunological memory preceded our understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of this memory by centuries. During a plague in Athens in 430 B.C.E., the citizens understood that having the good fortune to recover from the disease, they could care for the newly stricken because no one was \u2018attacked twice, at least not fatally\u20191. The simple principle that survival of an infection or exposure to a less virulent or attenuated form of a pathogen leads to lifelong immunity formed the foundation of Edward Jenner\u2019s development of a vaccine for smallpox, an infectious disease that had the power to decimate entire populations in Europe in the mid-1700s2. Even fairly recent vaccines, such as those that elicit protective immunity to polio, measles and rubella, were developed for the most part without comprehensive knowledge of the mechanisms underlying immunity. Unfortunately, not all attempts to develop vaccines have been successful; worse, some vaccines were actually shown to be harmful to humans, as was the tragic case for respiratory syncytial virus3. In addition, to date, we have not succeeded in producing effective vaccines for some of the world\u2019s most lethal diseases, including AIDS and malaria4,5. The hope is that more detailed knowledge of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the generation of protective, long-lived antibody responses and B cell memory will allow the development of safe, effective vaccines for pathogens for which we currently have none. Moreover, such knowledge may have broader benefits; for example, for the development of therapies for both systemic autoimmune disease and B cell tumours that may be, in part, unintended consequences of the drive to generate B cell memory6,7.",

            "text": "We now understand that immunological memory for many infectious diseases is acquired after a single infection and is dependent on the acquisition of two main \u2018walls\u2019 of memory; namely, long-lived plasma cells that produce protective antibodies and memory B cells that are able to respond on reinfection to pathogens and their variants. This process is detailed in several excellent recent reviews8\u201311. The antigen-driven generation of long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells from the naive B cell repertoire in the primary response to antigen occurs predominantly in secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) in B cell follicles and in germinal centres (GCs) in two consecutive phases12\u201314. In phase 1, antigenic stimulation through B cell antigen receptors (BCRs) induces naive B cells to differentiate into short-lived plasma cells and GC B cells in the B cell follicles. In phase 2, antigens drive GC B cells to differentiate into long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells in GCs. In subsequent recall responses to antigens, memory B cells respond by differentiating into long-lived plasma cells or by re-entering the GC reaction. In this Review, we describe these two main phases of memory B cell development, highlighting some of the key variables that predict success at each step. We also briefly describe how chronic infectious diseases, including AIDS and malaria, may derail the acquisition of protective B cell memory. In this context, we speculate on the utility of leapfrogging over the development of vaccines for such chronic infectious diseases and providing protection through prophylactic, broadly neutralizing antibodies.",

            "text": "Naive B cells first encounter antigen in the B cell follicles of SLOs15 (Fig. 1). Antigen binding to BCRs results in downstream BCR signalling and in the internalization, processing and presentation of the BCR-bound antigen on MHC class II molecules16. Antigen-activated naive B cells increase their metabolic activity17 and express chemoattractant receptors (CC-chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) and EBI2) that direct them to the border of the T cell zone18, where they interact with antigen-specific T helper cells (TH cells) that have been primed by antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) to differentiate towards T follicular helper cells (TFH cells)19 (Box 1). Recent studies suggest that during virus infections there may be additional layers of regulation of B cell responses at the follicular border mediated by IL-4-producing natural killer T cells20. Naive B cells appear to be multipotent and have at least three fates following interactions with TH cells. Naive B cells can differentiate into short-lived plasma cells that rapidly produce pathogen-specific antibodies of both switched and unswitched isotypes, albeit of relatively low affinity. Short-lived plasma cells accumulate in the red pulp regions of the spleen and medullary cords of lymph nodes, and their lifespans are generally limited to the course of the infection21. Naive B cells can also differentiate into GC B cells that will subsequently enter GCs in phase 2 and differentiate into long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells. Naive B cells may also give rise to memory B cells in the follicle independently of GCs. Indeed, B cells in BCL-6-deficient mice, which cannot develop GCs, were shown to differentiate into both IgM+ and IgG+ memory B cells that had not acquired somatic hypermutation (SHM), but these B cells did not differentiate into long-lived plasma cells22. Subsequent studies showed that GC-independent memory B cells that were mainly IgM positive were derived directly from a multipotential precursor cell early in the immune response and that these same precursors also gave rise to GC-dependent, switched immunoglobulin-positive memory B cells late in the response12. Lastly, long-lived memory B cells and both short-lived plasma cells and long-lived plasma cells can be generated by GC-independent and T cell-independent mechanisms21,23,24. T cell-independent type I and type II antigens have both been shown to generate long-lived plasma cells. Memory B cells were shown to be induced by T cell-independent type II polysaccharide antigens; however, these memory B cells show very low levels of SHM and isotype switching, are phenotypically distinct from memory B cells generated by naive B cells in response to T cell-dependent antigen and are stringently regulated in secondary responses by IgG antibodies specific for the immunizing antigen24. Importantly, T cell-independent type II polysaccharide vaccines such as Pneumovax confer long-term antibody protection in adult humans.",

The authors examined the factors that influence the outcome of vaccination in mice containing naive B cells expressing human germline VRC01-class BCRs that recognize the broadly neutralizing epitope of HIV gp120 (ref.25). Taking advantage of the remarkable array of tools available to determine the frequency and antigen affinity of VRC01-class B cells and detailed knowledge of the VRC01-class B cell antigen, this study provided evidence that the precursor frequency of naive B cells expressing germline VRC01-class BCR (~1 in 106), antigen affinity (less than 1 \u03bcM) and avidity (an antigenic epitope valency greater than 60) were interdependently limiting for successful GC completion. High-affinity multimeric antigens were shown to be capable of driving relatively rare VRC01-class naive B cells to differentiate into GC B cells that underwent extensive SHM and differentiated into memory B cells following a single immunization.",

The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), which regulates plasma cell differentiation, was shown to also initiate the generation of GC B cells, depending on the level of expression of IRF4, determined by the strength of BCR signalling26. Transient low levels of IRF4 favoured GC cell fates in contrast to sustained and higher levels of IRF4, which promoted the generation of plasma cells. These findings suggest that low-affinity antigen\u2013BCR interactions that result in weak induction of IRF4 will initiate GC B cell differentiation, whereas high-affinity antigen\u2013BCR interactions that induce high levels of IRF4 will promote plasma cell differentiation. TFH cell help provided both through CD40L-induced CD40 signalling and through IL-21 appear to play roles in directing naive B cells towards GC differentiation versus plasma cell differentiation27. However, chronic CD40 signalling antagonized the differentiation of GC B cells and promotes plasma cell differentiation28,29. Recently, evidence was provided that B cell fate decisions are made in a multistep process in which CD40 signalling is required only early to achieve increases in BCL-6 expression and that prolonged CD40 signalling drives precursors away from GC B cell fates30.",

Recent studies comparing the affinity thresholds for BCR-induced activation of human tonsil naive B cells versus GC B cells provided evidence that naive B cells have an intrinsic affinity threshold that is 1/100 of that of GC B cells31. The estimated affinity of the BCRs expressed by naive B cells for the antigen in this study was ~0.5 \u00b5M, similar to the suggested minimal affinity threshold for naive VRC01-class B cell selection in the study described earlier (~1 \u00b5M)25. Given that these affinities are in the lowest range of affinities of functional antibodies32 it appears that there may be very little affinity-dependent exclusion of antigen-specific naive B cells in the first phase of antigen-driven differentiation. Even relatively low-affinity antigen-specific naive B cells would enter GCs and have an opportunity to differentiate into high-affinity long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells. Thus, very few antigen-specific B cells may be \u2018wasted\u2019 in phase 1 as a high affinity for antigen is not essential.",

Following this, BCR signalling in naive B cells was shown to trigger a shift from canonical to non-canonical autophagy, and enhancement of the non-canonical pathway changed mitochondrial homeostasis and influenced the GC and plasma cell fate decisions34. In another study, mice containing B cells that were diminished in their ability to form long-term conjugates with T cells were severely impaired in their ability to form GCs and to produce affinity mature antibodies following immunization35. In this study, the diminished ability to form B cell\u2013T cell conjugates was due to a deficiency in intersectin 2 (ITSN2), a guanine exchange factor for CDC42, a GTPase that is essential for the remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton in response to BCR signalling.",

Of particular interest are complexes of weakly immunogenic recombinant subunit antigens coupled to bacterial membrane complexes, such as the outer membrane complex of Neisseria meningitidis36, or to virus-like particles, which are non-replicating shells composed of viral structural proteins that when overexpressed assemble into dense, multiprotein arrays37. These antigens are proving to be exceptionally immunogenic and capable of routinely inducing high-titred persistent antibody responses, although the mechanisms underlying their potency are not well understood. Indeed, the highly successful human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, which comprises virus-like particles assembled from the major L1 proteins from four HPV types, provides near-complete protection from sexually transmitted HPV infections in naive individuals and may even be effective when administered in a single dose38. The HPV vaccine was shown to induce memory B cells in vaccinated naive individuals expressing potently neutralizing antibodies but ones that have not undergone extensive SHM39.",

LYVE1-expressing lymphoid endothelial cells and a network of surrounding CD169-expressing macrophages create a tight barrier that prevents movement of large antigens and antigen complexes into B cell follicles40. However, small antigens such as hen egg white lysozyme (HEL; 14.4 kDa) have been shown to penetrate B cell follicles within minutes after injection and pass into pores of the subcapsular sinuses or lymphatic conduits41,42. Larger antigens (more than 70 kDa), viruses and virus-like particles are captured by subcapsular sinus macrophages in the form of immune complexes or complement-coupled complexes. These are rapidly shuttled to non-cognate B cells that transport the antigens into follicles, where the complexes are deposited onto follicular DCs (FDCs)40,43 that provide a continuous supply of antigen during the B cell response44. FDCs also provide a 3D network on which B cells move within the follicle and secrete CXC-chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13), which recruits and retains CXC-chemokine receptor 5 (CXCR5)-expressing B cells in GCs44\u201346. The fact that in SLOs, B cells are exposed to both soluble and FDC-associated antigens raises an important question: is the outcome of a B cell\u2019s exposure to soluble antigens versus membrane-associated antigens similar? It is well established that membrane-associated antigens are highly effective at triggering B cell activation47. In addition, several studies in vitro have provided evidence that the requirements for B cell responses to soluble antigens versus membrane-associated antigens differ in a variety of parameters, including the requirement for co-receptors, responses to monovalent antigens, the regulation of cytoskeleton and the kinetics and regulation of BCR clustering31,48,49. However, at present we have little information concerning the fate of B cells responding to soluble antigens versus membrane-associated antigens either in vitro or in vivo. It would seem that vaccine design would benefit from such information.",

One important environmental factor is the presence of the pathogen or pathogen products and the signals of imminent danger these send to the host through innate immune receptors. A recent study showed that pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), in particular the CpG ligand for Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), had the unexpected effect on naive B cells of blocking antigen processing and presentation at a point after antigen internalization but before the delivery of the antigen to processing compartments50. Thus, CpG-stimulated B cells were less able to acquire T cell help. Parallel studies provided evidence that activated B cells that were unable to acquire T cell help shortly after BCR signalling underwent apoptosis due to induced mitochondrial dysfunction acting as a \u2018metabolic clock\u201917. These studies also showed that TLR9 stimulation rescued the antigen-activated B cells from apoptosis and drove their proliferation and differentiation into low-affinity short-lived plasma cells. Taken together these observations provide a mechanism by which naive B cells activated in the presence of pathogen products are fated to rapidly differentiate into short-lived plasma cells rather than committing to participate in time-consuming GC reactions (Fig. 2).",

Indeed, the yellow fever vaccine YF-17D, one of the most successful empiric vaccines ever developed, activates DCs through multiple TLRs51,52. However, the study just described suggests that if PAMPs accumulate in B cell follicles, B cells will respond to the signal of impending danger by differentiating immediately into relatively low-affinity short-lived plasma cells. That study showed that immunization of mice and humans with protein antigens with CpG as an adjuvant resulted in high levels of antibody that failed to affinity mature, consistent with GC-independent plasma cell generation50.

Here, the GC B cells highly express both the transcription factor BCL-6 and the G-protein-coupled receptor sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1P2), which promotes their retention in the GC54\u201356. In the GC dark zone, GC B cells proliferate and undergo SHM before exiting to enter the GC light zone, where they are selected to undergo one of three fates. First, some GC B cells differentiate into long-lived plasma cells that take up residence in the bone marrow and actively secrete large quantities of antibodies, persisting for years, potentially a lifetime, in the absence of antigen or a secondary challenge21,57. Second, some GC B cells differentiate into long-lived memory B cells, which are quiescent cells that reside in niches within SLOs and other tissues that promote their exposure to antigen. Third, GC B cells may re-enter the GC dark zone for additional rounds of SHM and selection, ultimately giving rise to memory B cells or long-lived plasma cells17,58\u201360. In secondary responses, on antigen rechallenge, memory B cells are activated and have at least two fates: they either differentiate into long-lived plasma cells or enter GCs to undergo rounds of population expansion, SHM and selection (Fig. 1).",

In contrast, the ability of B cells to engage antigen, signal in response to it and internalize it for processing and presentation were shown to be directly dependent on the B cells\u2019 affinity for the antigen16,61,62. B cells capture antigen from membranes through the exertion of pulling forces on the BCR\u2013antigen complex. Higher-affinity interactions are better able to resist the pulling forces and are more successful at internalizing antigen for presentation to TFH cells. Thus, B cell affinity is indirectly determined by the amount of antigen a B cell is able to capture from an FDC and present to a TFH cell in the GC (Fig. 3).",

Recent studies also provided evidence that GC B cells have \u2018rewired\u2019 CD40 and BCR signalling such that CD40 signals are transduced through nuclear factor-\u03baB and BCR signals are transduced through forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1), and both of these signalling pathways are required for induction of MYC, which is critical for GC B cell survival63.

For example, compared with naive human B cells, human GC B cells express very little VLA4 (also known as \u03b14 integrin), which is an integrin that stabilizes the initial interactions with antigen-bearing DCs by binding to VCAM1 and thereby lowers the affinity threshold for B cell activation31. In addition, compared with naive B cells, GC B cells were shown in mice to recognize antigen through specialized immune synapse architecture48. Subsequent studies provided a detailed picture of the GC B cell architecture, showing that BCRs expressed by GC B cells are concentrated in unique, highly dynamic actin- and ezrin-containing pod-like structures through which the BCRs exert pulling forces and test affinity31. Remarkably, the affinity of the antigen engaged by the GC B cell dictates the behaviour of the pod-like structures. Low-affinity antigens induce a dynamic searching behaviour with engagement and release of the antigen, whereas high-affinity antigens induce stable long-lived engagement of the GC B cell with the antigen-containing membranes31. A more detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying the initiation of BCR signalling in these GC B cell pod-like structures may provide insight into the design of vaccines to maximize selection of high-affinity GC B cells.",

            "text": "A central question for which we are just beginning to get answers concerns the control of the differentiation of GC B cells into long-lived plasma cells versus memory B cells in GCs. At present, the data support the concept of a fundamental dichotomy between the GC processes that drive plasma cell differentiation versus memory B cell differentiation. Studies using 5-bromodeoxyuridine pulse labelling provided evidence that GC responses undergo a temporal switch as they mature, first producing memory B cells with limited SHM and then generating long-lived plasma cells that contain more highly mutated variable (V) genes14. The observed paucity of mutations in the memory B cell compartment suggests that B cells have lower levels of affinity-based selection and have more broadly cross-reactive BCRs as compared with more highly mutated BCRs of long-lived plasma cells. Recent studies directly demonstrated that affinity selection is not equally applied to precursors of memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells, resulting in highly selected, high-affinity long-lived plasma cells and broadly reactive lower-affinity memory B cells. Analyses of single nitrophenyl-specific plasma cells and memory B cells provided evidence that the initial output of GCs in response to immunization was stringently selected, high-affinity plasma cells64. In contrast, only 65% of memory B cells were capable of producing high-affinity antibodies, indicating less stringent selection. Consistent with these observations, additional studies showed that only GC B cells that had acquired high-affinity BCRs for the immunizing antigen HEL through SHM differentiated into plasma cells65. Subsequent studies provided additional mechanistic detail concerning the selection of GC B cells into the plasma cell lineage, showing that plasma cell lineage commitment was favoured by BCL-6lowCD69hi GC B cells that expressed the transcription factor IRF4 (ref.66). The generation of BCL-6lowCD69hi GC B cells, which also expressed high levels of ICAM1 and SLAM, was regulated by T cell-mediated signalling through CD40, suggesting that TFH cell\u2013GC B cell interactions were key to the generation of GC B cells that were prone to differentiate into long-lived plasma cells.",

These memory B cell-prone B cells expressed higher levels of the transcriptional repressor BACH2, and their levels of BACH2 expression were inversely correlated with the strength of help provided by T cells. These data supported an instructive model for the selection of memory B cells in which T cells determine BACH2 expression, promoting differentiation to memory B cells, perhaps by promoting the transition of memory B cells to quiescence through the antiproliferative or prosurvival function of BACH2 (ref.68).",

However, memory B cell-derived plasma cells produced antibodies that recognized both the wild-type virus and the variant virus equivalently, or remarkably, recognized the variant virus better than the wild-type virus and did so without accumulating additional SHMs. Consistent with these results, studies that traced influenza virus haemagglutinin (HA)-specific B cells in mice immunized first with the Narita virus strain followed by challenge with the homologous virus or the heterologous PR8 virus strain demonstrated that pre-existing antibodies secreted by long-lived plasma cells protected against homologous challenge, whereas protection from heterologous challenge required memory B cell activation. These memory B cells were primarily directed towards the relatively invariant HA stem76. Studies of the antibody response in humans to vaccination with the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine showed that individuals who had low levels of pre-existing antibodies to the vaccine generated broadly reactive antibodies to the HA stem, whereas high pre-existing levels of antibody to the vaccine correlated with strain-specific, HA-head responses, suggesting that antibodies to the HA head blocked the generation of broadly protective stalk-specific antibodies77. Thus, an individual\u2019s immune history with influenza virus affects the ability to produce broadly protective B cell responses on challenge.",

Studies of the antibody response of mice immunized with Dengue virus envelope proteins and challenged with the same or variant virus proteins showed that the variant proteins stimulate predominantly IgM+ memory B cells with the most diverse and least mutated V genes79.

The findings from these studies are most relevant to antibody-mediated development of vaccines to induce protective immunity in naive individuals. However, there is an urgent need for vaccines for individuals who have chronic infections, including AIDS, malaria and hepatitis virus infections. The development of such vaccines may be highly challenging as current evidence indicates that such chronic infections have a profound impact on the memory B cell compartment, the repercussions of which we are just beginning to understand80. For example, one common feature of chronic infections is the large expansion of a novel population of T-bet+ memory B cells termed \u2018atypical memory B cells\u2019. We do not yet understand the function of these memory B cells in humans, and it is not entirely clear whether mouse models of T-bet+ memory B cells that arise with age and in certain infections are relevant to human atypical memory B cells and can be used as models to study atypical memory B cell80. Thus, we may be quite a distance from designing vaccines for chronic infections.",

The failure to develop vaccines for these two diseases as well as several others have led to efforts to leapfrog over vaccine development entirely and to directly provide highly effective broadly neutralizing antibodies as prophylactics (reviewed in refs4,5). This is not a new idea as passively transferred antibodies have been used for more than a century as therapeutics for infectious diseases such as diphtheria and tetanus and subsequently for several viral diseases, including infections with respiratory syncytial virus, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus. What is new, however, is the successful generation of rare, highly potent and broadly cross-reactive human monoclonal antibodies for several viruses, including HIV, and for the parasite that causes malaria. In addition, antibody engineering can increase the potency, cross-reactivity and half-life of such antibodies. Key to the discovery of these rare human antibodies was the careful selection of donors with desirable serum antibody profiles and the development of high-throughput human B cell isolation technologies. At present, passive antibody prophylaxis appears to be a promising alternative to vaccination for HIV infection. In addition, recent successes in vector-mediated antibody transfers in mice and macaques in which a single injection provided continuous and sustained delivery of antibody may provide an alternative form of antibody prophylaxis55,56. A number of antiviral and antimalaria monoclonal antibodies are in clinical development, and the results of these studies over the next several years will tell whether the current promise of this approach is fulfilled.",

What we know far less about is how to effectively design vaccines and adjuvants to reproducibly generate B cell memory.
