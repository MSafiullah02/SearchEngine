Typical symptoms include sore throat, rhinitis, cough and fever (Dasaraju and Liu, 1996, Eccles, 2007). Most RTIs are caused by a viral infection (Denny, 1995), for example, the symptom of sore throat is reported to be caused by viruses in 85\u201395% of cases in adults, 95% in children under 5 years and 70% in children aged 5\u201315 years (Worrall, 2011). Viruses associated with RTIs include orthomyxoviruses (influenza), paramyxoviruses (parainfluenza viruses [PIV], respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]), coronaviruses, picornaviruses, adenoviruses and herpes viruses (cytomegalovirus [CMV], Epstein\u2013Barr virus [EBV]) (Collier and Oxford, 2000).",

            "text": "Although RTIs are generally self-limiting and have a predominantly viral cause, patients visiting healthcare professionals often expect antibiotics (or are perceived to expect antibiotics) and receive inappropriate antibiotic treatment (van der Velden et al., 2013). In Europe, one-quarter of those who took antibiotics in the last year did so to provide symptom relief, and there remains much consumer confusion about the effects of antibiotics with 49% of Europeans falsely believing that antibiotics kill viruses and 41% believing they were effective against colds and flu (European Commission, 2013). Physicians respond to sore throat patients\u2019 demands (actual and perceived) by prescribing an antibiotic in approximately 60% of cases (Barnett and Linder, 2014, Gulliford et al., 2014) but only about 5\u201315% of sore throats in adults are caused by a bacterial infection (Shulman et al., 2012). This unnecessary use of antibiotics drives the development of antibiotic resistance (Goossens et al., 2005), which is an increasingly serious threat to global public health (WHO, 2014). Therefore, there is a need to encourage patients with RTIs to try alternative treatments, while antibiotics should be reserved for patients with a serious illness or those at increased risk of complications (Essack and Pignatari, 2013).",

Locally delivered formats such as lozenges and sprays are useful as they enable active ingredients to reach the site of infection directly; the localized delivery means that side effects are lower compared with systemically acting treatments (Farrer, 2011). Lozenges containing the antiseptics and local anaesthetics amylmetacresol (AMC) and 2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol (DCBA) or hexylresorcinol have been developed to treat the symptoms of sore throat (Buchholz et al., 2009, Foadi et al., 2014, McNally et al., 2010, McNally et al., 2012, Wade et al., 2011). These lozenges have demonstrated statistically significant reductions in sore throat symptoms in placebo-controlled clinical trials (McNally et al., 2010, McNally et al., 2012, Wade et al., 2011). AMC/DCBA lozenges have demonstrated antibacterial effects in vivo (Richards et al., 1989) and in vitro (Richards and Xing, 1993). AMC/DCBA lozenges have also been shown to have some virucidal effects in vitro on three enveloped viruses \u2013 RSV, influenza A virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Oxford et al., 2005).",

In a study in China from 2009 to 2011, 3.7% of children and adults with RTI were positive for PIV (2.1% were positive for PIV3), with seasonal peaks of PIV3 and PIV1 occurring from April to July and September to November (Liu et al., 2013). In a study in Brazil from 2000 to 2010, 1.6% of children and adults with influenza-like illness were positive for PIV3, with the prevalence peaking in the second half of each year (Freitas, 2013). In contrast, in the USA from 1990 to 2004, seasonal peaks of PIV3 occurred in the spring, sometimes with a second smaller peak during the autumn (Fry et al., 2006). PIV can cause the symptom of sore throat (Bisno, 2001); in the study in China, 19% of patients with parainfluenza virus infection had the symptom of pharyngeal discomfort (Liu et al., 2013).",
