Whilst this pandemic will pass, its impact will likely be tangible for years to come and adjusting to life after the COVID-19 response may be difficult for some healthcare staff. Encouraging staff to check in and debrief with colleagues, seek support early, providing access to free counselling and psychological services and approving leave of absences to provide time for gradual reintegration into usual schedules may be helpful. If maternity providers experience several weeks of stress which interferes with work and life functioning, formal mental health care should be encouraged [13].",

Cooperation, planning ahead and thinking about the needs of maternity providers to prevent stress and burnout is essential, so that they in turn can continue to care for women and newborns whilst managing the demands of the COVID-19 response. Adequate availability of PPE is a critical first step followed by top order priorities of food and rest [3]. Emotional and psychological support needs to be available and encouraged before, during and after the response. In responding to this pandemic, healthcare workers are every country\u2019s most valuable resource [3]. Now and over coming months, the maternity care system will face unchartered territory as doctors, midwives, nurses and allied health staff attempt to provide usual quality maternity care whilst juggling competing demands related to the COVID-19 pandemic response.",
