However, no clear indications/criteria can be provided pending further experience.

Although promising in pre-clinical studies, remdesivir should be currently used for treating COVID-19 patients only within RCT (preferentially) or compassionate/expanded-access programs, owing to its investigational nature.

This suggestion is based on its demonstrated activity in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 (although weak) and on the availability of low-level clinical evidence of anticipation of viral clearance from a small controlled, non-randomized study, although it should also be kept in mind that the study was highly susceptible to bias and there is still no data regarding hard clinical endpoints such as crude mortality. For these reasons, hydroxychloroquine should be preferentially administered within the framework of investigational studies. When this is unfeasible, off-label use may be considered according to local protocols and consent procedures. In view of the absence of evidence, we are currently unable to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic non-hospitalized patients outside investigational studies. The same applies to prophylactic use.",

This suggestion is based on the fact that bacterial coinfection: (i) is common in patients with viral pneumonia; (ii) can be associated with a substantial risk of delaying appropriate treatment, thereby potentially increasing mortality. Because of the limited available data on both the microbiological epidemiology (and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance) of bacterial superinfections in COVID-19 patients, it is difficult to provide specific pathogen-oriented recommendations. Therefore, pending further studies, we suggest to empirically treat COVID-19 patients according to their clinical syndrome (e.g., community acquired pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia), choosing the most suited antimicrobial agent/s based on local guidelines and local antibiotic susceptibility patterns, with early de-escalation or discontinuation according to microbiology results, whenever available.",

However, considering that overwhelming inflammation and cytokine-related lung injury might be responsible for rapidly progressive pneumonia and clinical deterioration in COVID-19 patients [45, 59, 68], we suggest (expert opinion only) to consider administration of corticosteroids in critically ill COVID-19 patients with ARDS or with worsening of non-ARDS respiratory failure in the absence of bacterial/fungal superinfections (independent of ICU admission). On the other hand, in the absence of convincing evidence the following cannot currently be supported: (i) steroid administration stratified according to inflammatory markers; (ii) steroid administration in non-critically ill COVID-19 patients.",

Corticosteroids should be initiated early in well-defined categories of patients (patients with ARDS or with worsening of non-ARDS respiratory failure in the absence of bacterial/fungal superinfections), while their role in other COVID-19 patients still remains uncertain. Although based on low-level evidence and pending RCT results, in our opinion early hydroxychloroquine administration should be considered in COVID-19 patients presenting with moderate to severe symptoms, whereas further data is needed to better delineate the true balance between possible favorable effects and toxicity of hydroxychloroquine in mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.",

Early discontinuation should be considered in the presence of adverse effects (e.g., QT prolongation or hepatic/renal toxicity, see table 3). If the administration of remdesivir is approved within compassionate/expanded access programs, treatment duration should follow compassionate or expanded access protocols (e.g., up to ten days according to the most recent compassionate protocol at the time of this review). If corticosteroids are administered, we suggest a total treatment duration of 7-10 days, with progressive dosage reduction. If the patient deteriorates with worsening lung physiology after removal of steroid treatment in the absence of bacterial or fungal superinfection, a second course of corticosteroid treatment may be considered, followed by slow tapering after improvement.",

Finding the right balance between these two forces is certainly not simple, but also remains more necessary than ever if we want to rapidly find effective and safe treatment. For this reason, RCT should always the first option to be proposed to patients, since they are the only way for providing high-level efficacy and safety information for optimizing the treatment of future patients. However, even when rapidly implemented during rapidly evolving pandemics, RCT are usually not immediately available (e.g., even if accelerated, local approval still and correctly requires time to guarantee ethical standards), and also many patients are usually excluded from RCT because of strict selection criteria [87, 88]. For some of these patients, off-label uses (for drugs approved for other indications) and compassionate/expanded-access programs (for investigational drugs) may represent an ethically justifiable option, in the case of worsening conditions and unlikely survival with only supportive care.",

Otherwise, scientific data will still be produced, but most information will be burdened by only partially adjustable selection biases and confounding factors, with consequent risks of inconclusive results and low-level supporting evidence for the various treatment options. If participation in RCT is maximized, high-level evidence will be available for guiding treatment, with lower level evidence from off-label uses still remaining useful for hypothesis-generating purposes, in order to better design further RCT (and not for directly guiding treatment choices). Notably, this is what, in our opinion, happened with LPV/RTV: (i) pre-clinical data supported activity against coronaviruses; (ii) patients were enrolled in RCT whenever possible, otherwise they were offered off-label administration when not spontaneously improving; (iii) since many patients were rapidly enrolled in the first RCT, evidence rapidly become available that in our opinion discourage an universal off-label use of LPV/RTV in COVID-19 patients.",

Implementation of well-designed RCT should be expanded as much as possible, being the most secure way to change for the better our approach to COVID-19 patients, including our frontline opinions.",
