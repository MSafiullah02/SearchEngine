Acronyms and abbreviations are formed by combining the first letter or letters of several words. All acronyms are abbreviations, but not all abbreviations are acronyms. An acronym is a special type of abbreviation that can be pronounced as a single word (it can be said), while all other abbreviations are pronounced letter by letter (you say each letter individually or spell it out).",

Abbreviations that some consider universally known may be obscure to others. In addition, shortened forms used in one country may not be understood in another. In order to eliminate guesswork and prevent frustration, we have put together an alphabetized list of the most commonly used English acronyms and abbreviations in biomedical research. We feel that having a central reference list at your fingertips could be quite helpful for your scientific communications.",
