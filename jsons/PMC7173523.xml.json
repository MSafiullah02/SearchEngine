Epidemics of bronchiolitis in early spring and fall often are caused by parainfluenza virus type 3.11, 12, 13, 14 The yearly cycles of these respiratory viruses are depicted in Figure 33-1\n. Other viral causes of bronchiolitis include rhinoviruses and coronaviruses.",

Alternatively, the increase in hospitalization may reflect increased use of daycare centers or changes in criteria for admission.3 Household crowding is an important risk factor for severe viral lower respiratory tract illness due to RSV as well as other respiratory viruses.34, 35 Generally it is recognized that as the number of household members increases, the risk of exposure to infectious respiratory secretions also increases. Childcare attendance has been correlated with an increased risk of bronchiolitis in some studies. Unlike other respiratory virus infections, exposure to passive household tobacco smoke has not been associated with an increased risk of RSV hospitalization on a consistent basis. In contrast to the well-documented beneficial effect of breastfeeding against some viral illnesses, existing data are conflicting regarding the specific protective effect of breastfeeding against RSV infection.35, 36, 37, 38, 39 Parental history of bronchiolitis or asthma is associated with a higher risk for the development of lower respiratory illness in offspring.40, 41\n",

Most severe RSV disease occurs in the first 6 months of life so that birth shortly before or early after the onset of the RSV season will result in a longer period of exposure to RSV earlier in life. Second, maternal antibody concentrations to RSV show seasonal variation and infants born early in the RSV season are more likely to be born to mothers with low serum antibody concentrations to the F (fusion) protein of RSV.42, 43 Low concentrations of RSV antibody correlate with susceptibility to severe RSV disease in infants.",

Because most healthy infants recover from bronchiolitis without incident, information regarding the pathologic changes caused by infection is inferred from animal studies and from biopsy or autopsy materials in severe cases. Viral infection causes profound alterations in the epithelial cell and mucosal surfaces of the human respiratory tract. The characteristic histopathology in bronchiolitis is a lymphocytic infiltration of the bronchiolar walls and edema of the surrounding tissue. Disease progression is associated with proliferation and necrosis of the bronchiolar epithelium. The sloughed necrotic epithelium and the increased mucus production lead to obstruction of the lumen of the infant's small airways. Air movement is restricted during inspiration and expiration but is more restricted during expiration when the lumen is further compromised by positive expiratory pressure, resulting in expiratory wheezing. The obstruction results in air trapping and the characteristic appearance of hyperinflation on chest radiographs. As this air is absorbed, the radiographic pattern evolves to show atelectasis.44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49\n",

            "text": "Bronchiolitis represents the late stage of a respiratory disease that progresses over several days. Upper respiratory tract symptoms consisting of nasal discharge and mild cough begin about 3 to 5 days after onset of infection. Approximately 30% to 40% of RSV-infected infants have progression of disease to involve the lower respiratory tract. Spread to the lower airway occurs either by aspiration of RSV-infected epithelial cells or by cell-to-cell spread of the virus. Lower-airway involvement is marked by a sudden increase in the work of breathing, cough, tachypnea, wheezing, crackles, use of accessory muscles, and nasal flaring.61, 62 The respiratory rate often exceeds 60 to 70 breaths/minute in young infants, and expiration is prolonged. Intercostal and subcostal retractions with wheezing are evident. Initially, wheezing occurs during the expiratory phase only and is only audible through a stethoscope. As wheezing progresses, it can be heard without a stethoscope. The chest becomes hyperexpanded and hyperresonant, respirations more labored, and retractions more severe. Hypoxemia out of proportion to clinical distress is typical of RSV infection. Mild hypoxemia occurs even in otherwise well-appearing infants, the so-called happy wheezers. Respiratory failure can be due to hypoxemia (an early and sometimes sudden occurrence) or progressive hypercapnia due to fatigue. The small airways of young infants can become so narrowed that wheezing is inaudible. In this setting disease severity is recognized by the absence of audible air exchange, flaring of the alae nasae, expiratory grunting, severe subcostal, supraclavicular, and intercostal retractions, and hypoxemia. Progressive illness often is accompanied by a rapid fall in oxygen saturation after minimal manipulation. A child with these findings usually requires intubation and ventilatory support. Apnea can be an early manifestation of RSV infection, at times resulting in respiratory failure.63 RSV-related apnea is mediated by the central nervous system, occurring in young, often prematurely born infants.64 Because the severity of bronchiolitis often waxes and wanes prior to consistent improvement, assessment of respiratory status can vary markedly over a short period. The ability of the young infant to breast- or bottle-feed without distress over time often provides a practical guide to disease severity and management. An infant who has substantial difficulty feeding as a result of respiratory distress has moderate or severe illness and usually requires hospitalization.",

The typical course for a previously healthy infant older than 6 months is one of improvement over 2 to 5 days, as evidenced by decreases in respiratory rate, retractions, duration of expiration, and oxygen requirement. The median duration of symptoms in 95 infants with first-time bronchiolitis who came to medical attention at an emergency department in Wisconsin was 15 days and one-quarter of the infants remained symptomatic after 3 weeks.75 Pulmonary function abnormalities and evidence of mild desaturation (oxygen saturations in the range of 93% to 95%) can persist for several weeks.76 The differential diagnosis of bronchiolitis includes airway hypersensitivity to environmental irritants, anatomic abnormality of the airway, cardiac disease with pulmonary edema, cystic fibrosis, foreign-body aspiration, and gastroesophageal reflux.",

Although viral culture of respiratory secretions has been the \u201cgold standard\u201d for diagnosis of RSV infection, it often is too slow a method to be clinically useful. Enzyme immunoassays and direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) techniques for the identification of RSV, influenza virus, parainfluenza viruses, and adenoviruses permit rapid and accurate diagnoses.77, 78, 79, 80, 81 Nasal wash is the preferred method of specimen collection. The DFA test permits evaluation of adequacy of the specimen's number of epithelial cells for antigen detection. A respiratory screening of nasal secretions using pooled monoclonal antibodies to the common agents of bronchiolitis, followed by specific identification for a positive reaction, is a cost- and time-saving procedure compared with standard tissue culture isolation. Amplification of virus using the shell vial method, followed by use of specific monoclonal agents, and amplification of viral genome by the polymerase chain reaction offer the promise of improved sensitivity for rapid detection but are not as widely available nor as rapid as enzyme immunoassay and fluorescent antibody techniques.82, 83 A multitest system for quantitative reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction\u2013enzyme hybridization assay (Hexaplex) is available to test a single nasopharyngeal sample for RSV, influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus, and adenoviruses.84\n",

Overall, their analysis supported a beneficial effect in certain infants, but identifying those infants could not be consistently accomplished at the time of initial presentation. On balance, an initial trial of bronchodilator therapy for the hospitalized infant with bronchiolitis is reasonable, although brief episodes of hypoxia can be precipitated by adrenergic agents. Bronchodilator therapy should only be continued if consistent improvement in respiratory distress or oxygen saturation is observed. Racemic epinephrine should not be continued beyond one or two doses.",

However, a national collaborative, blinded, placebo-controlled trial conducted in Canada demonstrated that the combination of nebulized epinephrine and oral dexamethasone treatment for children with bronchiolits evaluated in emergency departments reduced the subsequent rate of hospitalization by 9% compared with placebo or either treatment alone (P=0.07) and was less costly.112, 113\n",

These studies were challenged on the basis that control groups received water aerosols, which may produce bronchospasm in individuals with hyperreactive airways. Clinical trials with ribavirin have not demonstrated a consistent decrease in need for mechanical ventilation, decrease in length of stay in the intensive care unit, or reduction in days of hospitalization. Conflicting results from efficacy trials, concern about potential toxic effects among exposed healthcare professionals, aerosol route of administration, and high cost have all resulted in limited use of ribavirin.114, 115, 116 Guidelines for the use of ribavirin in RSV disease are presented in Chapter 225, Respiratory Syncytial Virus.",

Potential RSV vaccine candidates currently being evaluated include inactivated preparations of the purified fusion protein of RSV, DNA vaccines coding for the major immunogenic proteins of the virus, and replicating mutants of the virus that replicate in the upper respiratory tract but are inactivated at the higher temperatures of the lung.135\n",
