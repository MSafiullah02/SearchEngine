A hallmark of PAH is a vascular remodeling process that increases PVR and subsequent right ventricular hypertrophy and premature death [78]. Regardless of the underlying disease, chronic cor pulmonale is associated with progressive clinical deterioration and a poor prognosis in most cases. Incidence and prevalence of PAH is very similar in USA (2.0 and 10.6 cases of PAH per million inhabitants, respectively) and in UK (1.1 and 6.6 cases of PAH per million inhabitants, respectively) [49, 62].",

The aim of specific therapies for PH is to reduce PVR and thereby improve RV function. Currently, five classes of drugs have been applied for PAH:endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs), prostanoids, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators, and selective prostacyclin receptor agonists [89]. Despite improvement in patient symptoms and well-being with these agents, mortality rates remain high (~65% survival at 5 years). New therapies are needed targeting alternative pathways that can reverse pulmonary vascular remodeling, inhibit disease progression, and improve survival [23]. The RAS is being intensively studied as an alternative therapeutic target [90].",

Lungs of patients with PAH express high levels of ACE in the intra-acinar arteries, suggesting that locally increased production of Ang II, a potent pulmonary vasoconstrictor with mitogenic actions, may contribute to the process of pulmonary vascular remodeling [69]. Ang II is also capable of inducing an inflammatory response in the vascular wall. Ang II, via the type 1 (AT1) receptors, enhances the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through stimulation of NAD(P)H oxidase in the vascular wall, leading to endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation by stimulating the redox-sensitive transcription factors (NF-kB) and by upregulating adhesion molecules, cytokines, and chemokines [9]. De Man et al. [12] demonstrated increased serum levels of renin, Ang I, and Ang II and correlations with disease progression and mortality in patients with idiopathic PAH. Taken together, these findings indicate an active role for RAS in the pulmonary hypertensive process.",

[30] assessed the mechanism, safety, and efficacy of ACE2 (single IV infusion of GSK2586881) in the treatment of patients with idiopathic and heritable PAH (18 years) with functional class I-III. PAH patients had a significant decrease in ACE2 activity as reflected by the increased Ang II/Ang-(1-7) ratio in PAH patients compared with controls. After treatment, PAH patients had a decrease in Ang II/Ang-(1-7) ratio, suggesting increased activity of ACE2. In addition, levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD2) protein were approximately 25% lower in PAH plasma compared with controls. After treatment, there was significant induction of plasma SOD2 protein levels by 2 weeks suggesting induction in the enzymatic activity by GSK2586881. Compared with control, patients with PAH had increased levels of cytokines (IL-10, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-13, IL-8, and IL-4). After GSK2586881 administration, there was suppression of IL-10, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, and TNF-\u03b1 that could be detected as early as 2 hours after drug administration and was associated with sustained anti-inflammatory effects with reduced levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 at 2 weeks [30]. Taken together, these data showed that treatment with ACE2 reduced the markers of oxidant and inflammatory mediators and improved the balance between ACE/Ang II/AT1 receptor and ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis.",

Drugs that inhibit the synthesis of Ang II (ACE inhibitors) or that antagonize AT1 receptors (Ang II receptor blockers \u2013 ARBs) have been shown to decrease right ventricular hypertrophy, decrease medial thickening and peripheral muscularization of small pulmonary arteries in hypoxic animals [65]. In addition, ACE2 [17, 94] or Ang-(1-7) itself, by targeted gene transfer, protects the lungs in a model of pulmonary hypertension [82]. The effects of Ang-(1-7) appear to be associated with upregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation via AKT pathway [7]. Recently, Zhang et al.

Losartan delayed the onset of ARDS in Wistar rats challenged by i.t. instillation of Bordetella bronchiseptica, prevented progressive deterioration of gas exchange and delayed the mortality of infected rats [72]. The signs of inflammation, thickened alveolar septae, and a marked increase in cellularity dominated by polymorphonuclear leukocytes were much less evident in losartan-treated rats. Although this effect was associated with a significant inhibition of lung-neutrophil recruitment, lung bacterial clearance was not impaired but rather, it was significantly improved. Similar results were found with irbesartan. Differently, neither the ACE inhibitor captopril, nor the nonselective peptide inhibitor of Ang II receptors, saralasin, reproduced these effects. The protective effects of losartan on ARDS were attributed, at least in part, to NF-kB and MAPK mechanisms. In a sepsis-induced ARDS using cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), Shen et al. [81] demonstrated that losartan treatment significantly led to inhibition of lung tissue NF-kB activation, attenuated degradation of IkB-alpha, and inhibited phosphorylation of p38MAPK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, critical pathways for cytokine release. Similarly, results of Raiden et al. [72] showed that losartan delays the onset of ARDS triggered by a bacterial infection, prevents blood gas deterioration and histopathologic appearance of ARDS, and significantly improved survival after sepsis.",

Previous studies have found that ACE2 mRNA, protein, and enzymatic activity were severely downregulated in human and experimental lung tissue injuries [34, 41]. The decrease in ACE2 expression was importantly involved in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), in which the pathogen, coronavirus (SARS-CoV), triggers severe pneumonia and acute, often lethal, lung failure. Kuba et al. [41] demonstrated that ACE2 is a crucial SARS-CoV receptor in vivo, and both SARS-CoV infections and the Spike protein of the SARS-CoV reduced ACE2 expression, contributing to the severity of lung pathology. In addition, the injection of SARS-CoV Spike into mice worsens acute lung failure in vivo. This effect was associated with an increase in Ang II in the lung and it was attenuated by blocking AT1 [41].",

ARDS resulted in reduced ACE2 expression and increased Ang II production in ACE2+/+ animals as a result of insults. Elastance of the respiratory system, as well as pulmonary edema, was significantly higher in sepsis groups, mainly in ACE2\u2212/\u2212 mice. In addition, it was observed thickening of the alveolar wall, edema and pulmonary congestion, infiltration of inflammatory cells and hyaline membrane in sepsis-induced ACE2\u2212/\u2212 mice. After 6 hours of observation, all animals in the ACE2+/+ group were alive and only 2 of the 10 animals in the ACE\u2212/\u2212 group survived. Moreover, intraperitoneal injection of recombinant human ACE2 protein (rhuACE2) in ARDS induced in ACE2\u2212/\u2212 mice prevented the increase in elastance of the respiratory system and formation of pulmonary edema. In contrast to ACE2\u2212/\u2212 mice, mice with genetic deletion of ACE (ACE\u2212/\u2212) are protected against acid aspiration-induced ARDS and inactivation of ACE in ACE2\u2212/\u2212 animals attenuates ARDS. Likewise, pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of AT1a (AgTr1a\u2212/\u2212) receptors significantly attenuated lung function and edema formation. On the other hand, inactivation of AT2 receptors aggravated acute lung injury (ALI) [34].",

Pretreatment with captopril or concomitant infusion with losartan or PD123319 in the high-volume group attenuated the lung injury and inflammation.

In addition, administration of Ang-(1-7) or AVE0991 restored arterial pressure and kept throughout experimental protocol (4 h), which falls rapidly by approximately 40% in untreated animals. Ang-(1-7) or its analog AVE0991 also prevented a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance, characteristic for the acute phase of ARDS. Further, Ang-(1-7) or AVE0991 blocked the increase in TNF-\u03b1 concentration in bronchoalveolar (BALF). These effects were antagonized by A779 and D-Pro7-Ang-(1-7) [40]. Corroborating with the results of Imai et al. [34], treatment with ibesartan, an AT1 blocker, normalized systemic blood arterial pressure, pulmonary arterial resistance, wet-to-dry lung weight ratio, BALF protein concentration, and myeloperoxidase activity in lung tissue. The beneficial effect of ibesartan was prevented by co-treatment with either A779 or d-Pro7-Ang-(1-7) on systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics. Thus, the protective effect of recombinant ACE2 or AT1 antagonization in ALI may be related at least in part to increased formation of Ang-(1-7) and stimulation of its specific receptor signaling pathways [40].

[95] evaluated the potential for Ang-(1-7) to attenuate ARDS severity and lung fibrosis in a preclinical ARDS model. These authors evaluated if Ang-(1-7) would reduce the severity of early ARDS induced by the combined \u2018insults\u2019 induced by unilateral acid aspiration model followed by high stretch mechanical ventilation. Ang-(1-7) acute infusion showed a significant improvement of arterial oxygenation and inflammatory response (in terms of polymorphonuclear recruitment into alveoli) in acute ARDS. In other protocol, two weeks of Ang-(1-7) infusion increased blood oxygen saturation and the right lung from treated rats showed a significant reduction in collagen deposition. Thus, the inhibitory effect of Ang-(1-7) on inflammatory cells recruitment seen in the acute phase may be related to the reduction of fibrosis in the later phase. The beneficial effects observed by Jiang et al. [37] and Jerng et al. [35] may be related to the formation of Ang-(1-7) from the use of captopril and/or losartan.",

The use of twice-daily doses of GSK2586881 infusion (0.4 mg/kg) for 3 daysresulted in a decrease in plasma Ang II associated with an increase in Ang-(1-7) and Ang-(1-5) that remained elevated for 48 h.

Although no episodes of hypotension were associated with infusion of GSK2586881, no significant improvement in oxygenation was observed in patients (ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen-PaO/FIO2, oxygenation index), or Sequential Organ Failure Assessment-SOFA score between treated and placebo groups was observed, which the authors attributed to numerous factors that were not adequately controlled for in this trial [39].

The inflammatory response in allergic asthma is characterized by excess production of IgE, mast cell degranulation, and the infiltration of eosinophils and lymphocytes [22, 83]. However, the recruitment and activation of these cells depend on the expression and release of several classes of proteins, such as cytokines, particularly Th2-derived. Inflammatory mediators that increase influx of leukocytes, activity, and survival of eosinophils are positively correlated with asthma severity [14, 19].

Sensitization is traditionally performed by intraperitoneal and subcutaneous routes, and the challenges with allergens are performed through aerosol, intranasal, or intratracheal instillation. Sensibilization increases IgE levels in the circulation, but does not induce signs of inflammation or pulmonary remodeling. IgE binds to receptors in eosinophils, mast cells, and basophils. When the challenge occurs with the same allergen, the allergen provokes an antigenic-antibody reaction that induces the degranulation of these cells. Degranulation releases inflammatory mediators that initiate and propagate the process. Ovalbumin (OVA) is a widely used allergen, because promote to an intense allergic lung inflammation. In addition, the most common species studied in the last two decades is mice, particularly BALB/c [15, 52].",

Moreover, Ang-(1-7) attenuated OVA-induced increase in the phosphorylation of I\u03baB-\u03b1 and ERK 1/2, suggesting that Ang-(1-7) could mediate an anti-inflammatory pathway in allergic asthma [15]. In chronic allergic lung inflammation that administration of Ang-(1-7) or a synthetic analog, AVE 0991 (Mas receptor agonist), decreased inflammatory cell infiltrate in the peribronchial, perivascular, and alveolar regions of the lung [52, 75]. Furthermore, Ang-(1-7) treatment decreased chemokines (CCL2 and CCL5), cytokines (IL-4, IL-5 and GM-CSF), IgE, and two signaling pathways associated with asthma, the ERK1/2, and possibly the JNK pathways. Altogether, these results suggest that Ang-(1-7) treatment decreases chemokines and cytokines essential for the initiation and maintenance of the inflammatory process, as well as those important for the migration of eosinophils to the site of injury and reduction of their apoptosis.

In a model of chronically OVA-sensitized and challenged mice, there was an increase in the deposition of collagen fibres in the airway wall, an increase in the expression of collagen I and III in the lung, along with thickening of the alveolar wall and smooth muscle of the arterioles. In addition, the OVA-mice showed right ventricular hypertrophy, probably due to a functional and structural adaptation in response to chronic pulmonary artery pressure overload [52]",

The inclusion of Ang-(1-7) into an oligosaccharide HP\u03b2CD cavity protects the peptide during its passage through the gastrointestinal tract. Resolution of inflammation is an active process that allows cessation of inflammation and re-establishment of tissue homeostasis. Therefore, oral treatment with Ang-(1-7) promoted prevention of excessive trafficking of eosinophil to the lung, shutdown intracellular signaling molecules associated with cytokine production and eosinophil survival, apoptosis of recruited eosinophil, and promotion of clearance of apoptotic leukocytes, i.e., efferocytosis. These effects induced the return of pulmonary homeostasis through a decrease in extracellular matrix accumulation and a great reduction in collagen I and III genes expression in the lung [54].",

The OVA produced a pronounced increase in the density of inflammatory cell infiltrate around the airways and blood vessels and alveolar parenchyma (a). Treatment with Ang-(1-7) attenuated the inflammatory infiltrate in the peribronchial, perivascular and alveolar regions of the lung (b). In addition, OVA mice exhibited significantly greater thickening and inflammation of the alveolar wall and bronchial wall thickness. Ang-(1-7) presented reduced inflammation in the interalveolar space with normal appearance of the alveolar lumen [52]",
