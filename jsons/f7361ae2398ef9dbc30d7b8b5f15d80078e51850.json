Fever, abdominal pain and either watery or bloody diarrhoea are the most frequent symptoms and amoebic colitis occurs at a range of CD4 counts and is not limited to individuals with CD4 T-cell counts o200 cells/mL [102] . Hepatic abscesses are the commonest extra-intestinal manifestation. Diagnosis involves microscopy of at least three stool samples for the detection of trophozoites or cysts. Antigen detection or PCR of stool may also be performed and endoscopy with biopsy can aid diagnosis if stool analysis fails to confirm the diagnosis or diagnostic uncertainty remains. Serology can be employed but remains positive for years after exposure and therefore direct identification of entamoeba is desirable. Extra-intestinal lesions are diagnosed in the appropriate clinical setting by imaging combined with serology.

Ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily is an alternative but response is slower and incomplete (category IIb) [105] . Relapses are described in over 40% of HIV-seropositive patients and secondary prophylaxis with TMP-SMX (960 mg three times a week) or ciprofloxacin (500 mg three times a week) is needed in the absence of effective ART [103, 105] . 4.4.5.5 Isospora belli. Isospora belli has no known animal host but is widespread geographically, causing selflimiting small bowel diarrhoea in HIV-seronegative individuals. It is implicated in 10-20% of cases of chronic HIV-related diarrhoea in the tropics and is an occasional cause of biliary disease. Treatment traditionally has been with TMP-SMX 960 mg qid po for 10 days though 960 mg bd appears also to be effective (category III recommendation) [105, 106] and secondary prophylaxis with the same antibiotic (960 mg three times a week) is essential as relapse is common and there is indirect [107] and direct evidence for efficacy [105, 106] . Ciprofloxacin is a less effective alternative for both treatment and prophylaxis [105] .

Corticosteroid use remains a major factor in case reports of hyperinfection syndrome of HIV-seropositive individuals [113] . Eosinophilia is present in most but not all patients. Uncomplicated infection is treated with ivermectin 200 mg/kg once a day po for 1 or 2 days, which is more effective than the alternative treatment of albendazole 400 mg bd po for 3 days [114] [115] [116] (category III recommendation). Case reports in HIV-seropositive individuals highlight the importance of following stool specimens and repeating treatment when parasites are apparent again. Some physicians repeat the initial 2 days of ivermectin treatment after 2 weeks [117] . Hyperinfection is treated with 14 days' therapy or longer until larvae clear. The basis of these recommendations, however, is largely from studies in non-HIV-related cases, although case reports of treatment in HIV exist [98] .
