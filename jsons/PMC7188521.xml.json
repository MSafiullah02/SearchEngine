Most of the drugs used to treat herpesvirus infections are nucleoside analogs that share the same mechanism of action, affecting viral DNA synthesis by inhibiting viral DNA polymerase, such as acyclovir (ACV), the gold standard in the treatment of herpetic infections [3]. Such infections have become an important public health issue, mainly due to the HSV ability to cause acute and recurrent infections, as well as the emergence of resistant strains, which hinder the management of herpesvirus infections [4\u20136]. New anti-herpes drugs are therefore needed.",

These compounds have been used clinically for over 200 years to treat heart diseases [7] and are characterized by their powerful cardiotonic action [8].

Among them, their cytotoxic and antitumor effects recently reviewed by Cerella et al. [10], De et al. [11], Diederich et al. [12], Schneider et al. [13] and El-Seedi et al. [14], as well as their anti-inflammatory [15], antiprotozoal [16], anti-oxidant and anti-aging [17] activities can be cited. Another suggested possibility is their potential antiviral action, as reported by several authors against adenovirus [18], chikungunya virus [19], coronavirus [20, 21], cytomegalovirus [22\u201324], dengue virus [25], herpes virus [26\u201328], HIV [29\u201331], human papillomarivus (HPV) [32], influenza virus [33\u201335], and respiratory syncytial virus [36] replication. The effects of six well-known cardiac glycosides (digoxin, digitoxin, ouabain, convallatoxin, G-strophanthin and lanatoside C) on viral biology and the mechanisms by which they impair the replication of different RNA and DNA viruses were recently compiled [37]. Most of these studies only reported the antiviral activity of cardenolides, and it is required to understand the mechanistic aspects involved and how the compounds really act to further evaluate their potential therapeutic application.",

            "text": "The mechanism by which cardenolides affect several steps of HSV replication could be related to the inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase in host cells. Many studies have demonstrated the modulation of Na+/K+-ATPase functions in host cells by DNA viruses (adenoviruses [18], cytomegalovirus [23, 70\u201372], and HSV [27, 28]), and RNA viruses (chikungunya virus [19, 73], coronaviruses [20, 74, 75], respiratory syncytial virus [76, 77], Ebola virus [78, 79], influenza virus [33, 80, 81], and HIV [30, 31, 82]). By activating signaling cascades or altering the concentration of intracellular ions, the binding of cardenolides to Na+/K+-ATPase seems to create an unfavorable environment for viral replication. Bertol et al. [26] showed that the inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase caused by glucoevatromonoside was correlated with virus release, and viral protein synthesis due to a reduction in the K+ concentration in the cell. Cohen et al. [23] found that the inhibitory activity of cytomegalovirus replication by convallatoxin was due to a decrease in immediate-early gene expression, and that the antiviral potency depends on the structure of cardiac glycosides and their specific interactions with Na+/K+-ATPase. It was also shown that influenza virus replication was impaired by ouabain through the inhibition of viral protein translation and a decrease in the intracellular K+ concentration [37]. Finally, Boff et al. [38] showed that C10 and C11 inhibited Na+/K+-ATPase, and a reduction in intracellular K+ concentration could explain the inhibitory activity of those steps of viral infection. In summary, the main antiviral mechanisms suggested for both DNA and RNA viruses are decreased transcription of viral genes and impaired synthesis of viral proteins due to interference with the host translational machinery, such as the inhibition of Na+/K+-ATPase [37].",

Most of the cardenolides tested by Bertol et al. [26], Dodson et al. [27], and Su et al. [28] presented one or more sugar moieties bind to C3, unlike the cardenolides C10 and C11. Both of which have substituted amine groups at C3 and are able to inhibit HSV replication at nanomolar concentrations, but not with the same potency as cardenolides bearing sugars at C3. Thus, the sugar moiety, although not essential for anti-herpes activity, nevertheless influences this activity positively. Moreover, C10 was found to be more active than C11 in all experiments, and therefore, we hypothesize that the secondary amine group located on the side chain might also contribute to the antiviral activity. Consistent with this, Fytas et al. [83] and Tataridis et al. [84] showed that the presence of additional amino groups in adamantane derivatives increased their antiviral activity.",

In a minor extension, they also interfere with the intermediate stages of viral replication but not with the early steps. Additionally, they were not virucidal and had no prophylactic effects. These results encourage us to continue studying cardenolides as an alternative for the treatment of herpes simplex virus infections. Despite both compounds presented promising results, C10 was more potent with a lower IC50 value and the best selectivity index. Wherefore, they can be considered new bioactive molecules with great potential as anti-herpes drug candidates mainly for HSV-1 (29-R strain), which is resistant to ACV treatment.",
