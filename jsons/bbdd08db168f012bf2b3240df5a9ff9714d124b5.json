Hence, the immune response in conventionally weaned pigs infected with PDCoV was assessed after challenge and rechallenge. After the first challenge, obvious diarrhea and viral shedding developed successively in all pigs in the four inoculation dose groups from 3 to 14 days postinfection (dpi), and all pigs recovered (no clinical symptoms or viral shedding) by 21 dpi. All pigs in the four groups exhibited significantly increased PDCoV-specific IgG, IgA and virus-neutralizing (VN) antibody (Ab) titers and IFN-\u03b3 levels in the serum after the first challenge. All pigs were completely protected against rechallenge at 21 dpi. The serum levels of PDCoV-specific IgG, IgA, and VN Abs increased further after rechallenge. Notably, the IFN-\u03b3 level declined continuously after 7 dpi. In addition, the levels of PDCoV-specific IgG, IgA and VN Abs in saliva increased significantly after rechallenge and correlated well with the serum Ab titers. Furthermore, the appearance of clinical symptoms of PDCoV infection in conventionally weaned pigs was delayed with reduced inoculation doses. In summary, the data presented here offer important reference information for future PDCoV animal infection and vaccineinduced immunoprotection experiments.",

            "text": "PDCoV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positivesense RNA virus [7, 12] . The PDCoV genome contains a 5' untranslated region (UTR) followed by open reading frame 1a/1b (ORF 1a/1b); sequences encoding the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), accessory protein 6 (NS6), nucleocapsid (N), accessory protein 7 (NS7), and accessory protein 7a (NS7a) proteins; and a 3' UTR [13, 14] . The E protein is a small envelope protein that plays an important role in viral assembly and infection [15] . The M protein plays an important role in inducing protection and mediating the course of disease [16, 17] . The N protein is principally produced in infected cells and plays multiple roles in viral replication and pathogenesis [13, 18] . The S protein contains three receptor-binding S1 subunits tightly packed into a crown-like structure and three membrane fusion S2 subunits forming a stalk. This protein has several structural features that may facilitate viral immune evasion, including compactness, concealed receptor-binding sites, and shielded critical epitopes [19] . Because the S protein is the major surface protein, it is also the main target of neutralizing antibodies (Abs) during infection and a focus in vaccine design [20] . PDCoV can infect pigs regardless of age; unweaned piglets infected with PDCoV display clinical symptoms similar to those seen in pigs infected with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), including watery diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and death [7, 11, 21] . Although previous studies have confirmed the postinfection effect of PDCoV in newborn and suckling piglets, few reports have addressed the pathogenicity of and immune response to PDCoV in conventionally weaned pigs. In addition, although a correlation of resistance to disease induced by PEDV infection with age has been described, little is known about the effect of PDCoV infection and re-challenge on weaned pigs. Therefore, 45-day-old weaned pigs were challenged and rechallenged with different inoculation doses of sixth-passage (P6) culture-adapted PDCoV strain CH/XJYN/2016 (GenBank accession number MN064712), and the immune response in the PDCoVinfected, conventionally weaned pigs was evaluated.",

Serum IFN-\u03b3 levels were measured using a commercial ELISA kit. The concentration of serum IFN-\u03b3 was obtained from a standard curve by multiplying by the dilution factor. The average serum IFN-\u03b3 levels were calculated, and the SD was plotted at each point. Significant differences are indicated by asterisks (p < 0.05) indicate that the appearance of clinical symptoms induced by PDCoV infection is delayed in conventionally weaned pigs with reduced inoculation doses. A similar pattern has been observed in previous PEDV infection studies [25, 26] .",

            "text": "Interestingly, we observed that the levels of IFN-\u03b3 were negatively correlated with the challenge dose and that viral rechallenge had no effect on the level of serum IFN-\u03b3. A previous study showed that PDCoV significantly induced expression of IFN mRNA in infected Peyer's patches at 3 dpi [27] . In this study, however, the levels of serum IFN-\u03b3 peaked 7 dpi. The difference may be due to the longer sampling interval. Therefore, a shorter sampling interval will help to obtain more-detailed information about the levels of serum IFN-\u03b3 after PDCoV-infection. Generally, swine enteric coronavirus challenge studies use the TCID 50 as the infectious titer [11, 21] . Practically, however, the infectious titer of PDCoV strains differs between pigs and cells, but the median pig diarrhea dose (PDD 50 ) of PDCoV in pigs of different ages is unknown. Therefore, before starting this study, a separate experiment was performed, and the results showed that 1000 TCID 50 is the lowest dose that can still reliably produce clinical symptoms in weaned pigs. Therefore, in this study, the infection dose used for rechallenge was 1000 TCID 50 .",
