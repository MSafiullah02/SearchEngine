            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first reported in Guangdong Province, China, in November 2002. Since then, it has spread to other Asian countries, North America and Europe. This outbreak reportedly affected more than 8000 individuals by July 2003, and resulted in 774 deaths. SARS is characterized by high fever, malaise, rigor, headache and non-productive cough or dyspnea and may progress to generalized interstitial infiltrates in the lung, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation [1]. In an unprecedented response, the World Health Organization (WHO) called upon leading laboratories in the world and set up multi-center research to investigate the etiology of SARS and develop effective diagnostic tests. With the aid of modern information technologies, WHO set up a secured website to share emerging scientific information among several laboratories. The critical results including electron micrographs of viruses, sequences of genetic material, identification and characterization of the virus, virus isolates, samples from patients, and postmortem tissues were shared in real time. The goal was to pin down the causative agent for SARS and to develop diagnostic tools. Within months, a novel coronavirus was isolated from patients with SARS. Then within days, after comparison of the sequences of the coronavirus polymerase gene against all previously characterized strains, scientists concluded that this virus is distinct from all previously known human pathogens. Just over a month after the outbreak of the new illness, WHO announced that a new pathogen, a member of the coronavirus family never seen before in humans, is the cause of SARS [2], [3], [4], [5]. In a remarkable scientific collaboration assembled by the WHO among teams of scientists from 13 laboratories in 10 countries, a novel coronavirus was identified as the etiological agent for SARS. Public health measures, including rapid identification of SARS cases and isolation of contacts, ultimately succeeded in controlling the 2002\u20132003 SARS epidemic. However, the identification of animal reservoirs for the virus and the possibility of re-emergence of epidemic or pandemic SARS provide strong motivation for the development of antiviral agents to treat this potentially fatal respiratory illness.",

Based upon the reported SARS-CoV 3CLpro structure [9], [14], AG7088 was modified by changing the P2 side chain from a p-fluorobenzyl group to the smaller benzyl and prenyl groups. These inhibitors possess a P1/P1\u2032- \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ester functionality, which can covalently link to the Cys-145. Compound 2 is inactive against SARS-CoV in cell-culture assay. The antiviral activity for 2 was reported to be >100 \u03bcg/ml [15]. The modified analogues are not only potent against SARS-CoV 3CLpro (k\ninact values), but are effective in a SARS-CoV cell assay (IC50 values) as well. No toxicity was observed up to 100 \u03bcM. Moreover, an X-ray crystal structure of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro covalently linked with the synthetic small molecule inhibitor (4) was reported. In addition to the important covalent bond formed between 4 and the protease, the X-ray structure also showed crucial hydrogen bonding between 4 and His-164 and Glu-166. It revealed important insight into the molecular recognition of this type of inhibitor by SARS-CoV 3CLpro.\n",

The best inhibition was obtained with the (S,S) diastereomer of compound 5 [k\ninact/K\ni=1900(\u00b1400) M/s].

The IC50 values of the inhibitors were in the low micromolar range [22], [23]. They synthesized a series of keto-glutamine analogues with the phthalhydrazido group at the \u03b1-position and attachment of tripeptide (Ac-Val-Thr-Leu) as the inhibitors (7\u201314) for SARS-CoV 3CLpro.

For the SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibiton assay, a C2-symmetric anti-HIV agent, compound 23 was found to inhibit SARS-CoV 3CLpro with a K\ni value of 0.6 \u03bcM and showed a protective effect in the viral replication assay at a concentration of 10 \u03bcM [34]. The docking simulation of 23 showed that it is folded into a ring-like structure in the active site. Along similar lines, a compound library consisting of 960 commercially available drugs and biologically active substances was screened for inhibition of SARS-CoV 3CLpro [35]. Potent inhibition was achieved with the mercury-containing compounds thimerosal, phenylmercuric acetate and hexachlorophene in 1\u201310 \u03bcM range. Each compound inhibited viral replication in Vero E6 cell culture. Detailed mechanistic studies using a fluorescence-based protease assay demonstrated that the three compounds acted as competitive inhibitors (K\ni=0.7, 2.4 and 13.7 \u03bcM for phenylmercuric acetate, thimerosal and hexachlorophene, respectively). However, mercury-containing compounds pose toxicity problems. A panel of other metal ions including Zn2+ and its conjugates were also evaluated for their anti-SARS-CoV 3CLpro activities. Among these, 1-hydroxypyridine-2-thione zinc was shown to be the most potent competitive inhibitor (K\ni=0.17 \u03bcM). The addition of zinc-containing compounds such as (e.g. zinc acetate) as a supplement to the drug for Wilson's disease [36], suggests that zinc ion may be safe for human use.\n",

Blocking the entry of a virus may effectively minimize the chance for the virus to evolve and acquire drug resistance [51], [52]. The S1 domain of the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein (S) can efficiently bind with a metallopeptidase, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), at the virus entry step [53], [54]. It was also proved in vivo that the binding of the S1 domain to ACE2 on host cell is responsible for SARS-CoV entry into the cells [55]. Anti-ACE2 antibody showed inhibitory ability toward viral replication on Vero E6 cells [56]. A human IgG1 form of 80R was found to bind the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV S protein (K\nd=1.59 nM) with a higher affinity comparable to that of ACE2 (K\nd=1.70 nM), which suggests that the 80R human monoclonal antibody is a useful viral entry inhibitor for SARS treatment [57].\n",

However, no information regarding their mechanism of action or the corresponding target is known. Glycyrrhizin showed inhibitory activity for SARS-CoV replication with EC50=300 mg/l after virus absorption in Vero cells [60]. Some glycyrrhizin acid derivatives were found to inhibit SARS-CoV replication in vitro with EC50 values ranging from 5 to 50 \u03bcM. Unfortunately, these compounds show high cytotoxity [61]. The viral entry step was suspected to be inhibited by these derivatives. Nitric oxide (NO) has shown an inhibitory effect on some virus infections [62]. An organic NO donor, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine was shown to inhibit the replication cycle of SARS-CoV in a concentration-dependent manner, probably during the early steps of infection [63]. HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir\n[64], antihelminthic drug niclosamide\n[65] and antimalarial agent chloroquine\n[66] all showed strong inhibitory activity (EC50=0.048 \u03bcM, EC50=1\u20133 \u03bcM, and IC50=8.8\u00b11.2 \u03bcM, respectively) against SARS-CoV replication. However, no cytoprotective effect was found for nelfinavir in an independent study [67], [68]. None of the foregoing compounds showed inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV 3CLpro or viral entry. Ribavirin, a broad-spectrum inhibitor of RNA and DNA viruses, was used for treatment of SARS patients [69], but it did not inhibit viral growth at concentrations attainable in human serum. In contrast, interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 showed an in vitro inhibitory effect starting at concentrations of 1000 IU/ml [70]. Interestingly, the combination of ribavirin and (IFN)-\u03b2 synergistically inhibited SARS-CoV replication [71].",

Already, a number of targets including SARS-CoV 3CLpro and SARS-CoV PLpro appear very promising for anti-SARS-CoV chemotherapy. Since the global outbreak of SARS ended in 2003, only a small number of cases of SARS associated with laboratory exposures have been reported. However, with the identification of Chinese horseshoe bats as an animal reservoir for SARS-CoV, the potential danger of the transfer of this virus to humans still exists. To date, there is no effective therapy for the treatment of SARS in humans. While structure-based design and the screening of compounds have provided a number of promising structural leads for SARS-CoV 3CLpro, potent, low molecular weight inhibitors with less toxicity are needed for development. Interest in structure-based design and screening of SARS-CoV PLpro will increase since the X-ray structure of SARS-CoV PLpro was recently determined. Development of anti-SARS-CoV chemotherapy, based on the viral entry-step mechanism holds promise and requires further exploration. It will be of interest to determine if antivirals directed against SARS-CoV will be effective against the recently identified human coronaviruses NL-63 and HKU1, which cause respiratory infections and pneumonia in children and the elderly. Thus, it is likely that the quest for SARS-CoV chemotherapy will be of relevance to other coronavirus-related ailments.",
