Digital finance can help in making available in real time, and possibly on a smartphone, the results obtained from a massive data analysis aimed at establishing the systemic consequences of a stressful event. This is clearly exemplified in the recent work of Yu et al. (2019), who show how artificial intelligence, econometrics, statistics and fast parallel computing can join their efforts to build a Financial Risk Meter (FRM, see Mihoci et al. 2020), that provides an easy-to-read and interpretable monitor of the impact of stressful events in finance. Such a monitor can be applied not only by policy makers, to take informed decisions, but also by citizens, to increase the knowledge and understanding of stress events, and of their impact, so to improve awareness and, eventually, acceptance of measures aimed at contrasting the source of such stress.",

The second starts on February 27th, when many positive contagion cases are also reported for France, Germany and the UK. In both cases, there is a sudden increase in the systematic risk values, both in their main body (the boxplots, which also show an increased variability between the constituent markets) and in their maximum values (the red line on top).

On the other hand, it is clear that this impact depends on what is the perceived effect of contagion, especially at the country level, as this is the level at which most policy-making decisions are taken. We believe that digital finance can, once more, help, by attempting to provide predictive models for COVID-19 diffusion for each country which can be made accessible on-line, to better inform the decisions of policy makers and to improve the awareness and the willingness to accept restrictive measures, also on the economic side. In addition, the same contagion diffusion measurements could be implemented in risk monitors, as the ones shown before, to improve predictions.",

The next section presents the proposed model. Section 3, instead, presents the results from the application of the model to the available time series for China. The data, available upon request to the Authors, allow the model to be reproduced and extended to other time periods and countries.",

Its inclusion is analogous to moving from an ARCH (Engle 1982) to a GARCH (Engle and Bollerslev 1986) model in Gaussian processes, and allows to capture long memory effects. The advantage of a log-linear intensity specification, rather than the linear one known as integer-valued GARCH (see, e.g., Ferland et al. 2006), is that it allows for negative dependence. From an inferential viewpoint, Fokianos and Tj\u00f8stheim (2011) show that the model can be estimated by a maximum likelihood method.",
