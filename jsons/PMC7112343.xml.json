Two species of Chlamydiae are well-known human pathogens: C. trachomatis (the agent of urethritis and cervicitis in adults and conjunctivitis and pneumonia in newborns) and C. psittaci (the agent of psittacosis, a zoonoses transmitted from birds). A third species, C. pneumoniae (formerly TWAR agent), recently has become well established as a common respiratory pathogen. This organism has been covered in detail elsewhere in this issue and is mentioned briefly because it relates to lower respiratory tract infection in infancy.",

Infection after cesarean section is rare but can occur when amniotic membranes have been ruptured before delivery. The portals of entry and subsequent sites of infection are the eyes, nasopharynx, respiratory tract, and vagina of the infant. The estimated incidence of infants born with chlamydial infection is 8.2 to 35 per 1000 live births.29, 37 The rate of transmission to an infant born to a mother infected with chlamydia is 50% to 70%, and of these infants, approximately 15% develop pneumonia.18, 29 Once transmitted, persistence of the organism may occur for as long as 3 years.19 This has profound implications for the diagnosis of sexual abuse of the child and is discussed elsewhere.18\n",

Onset of cough is insidious, often during a period of several days to weeks. Nasal discharge may or may not be present. Physical examination reveals a mild to moderately ill infant; with tachypnea, rales, and perhaps wheezing on auscultation. Otitis media is present in more than one half of the cases, although the etiologic role of chlamydia in the middle ear is controversial.37 The presence of conjunctivitis in a newborn or young infant with pneumonia should alert the clinician to the possibility of chlamydial infection. Its absence, however, does not rule out Chlamydia as a possible etiologic agent because concomitant conjunctivitis may be present only 50% of the time.29 Signs of systemic illness typically are not present.",

The spectrum of erythromycin includes Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus, Ureaplasma, and B. pertussis.
