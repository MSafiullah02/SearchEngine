In 2003, Holmes reported that the sudden emergence of SARS-CoV did not correlate to mutation or recombination between previous HCoV. On the other hand, genome sequencing and epidemiologic reports demonstrated that SARS-CoV was a new virus which was not similar to known HCoV [7]. However, the genome sequences of human SARS-CoV were similar to animal isolates and in addition, several serological studies confirmed that animal traders had specific antibody (IgG) against the SARS-CoV infection. These results displayed that SARS-CoV was a zoonotic virus and originated from animal and bird species before outbreaks in humans [1]. Moreover, in 2006, Li et al. reported that significant genetic changes occurred in the spike glycoprotein (S glycoprotein) of bat SARS-CoV to infect humans. Finally, the sequence data of SARS-CoV exhibited 87\u201392% identity with bat SARS-CoV and it was concluded bats were the potential natural reservoir for the outbreak of SARS in 2003 [8]. In fact, exotic animals have transmitted SARS-CoV to humans through intermediate hosts (civet cats and raccoon dogs) and subsequently, person-to-person transmission resulted in the outbreak of SARS-CoV in hotels and hospitals [9].",

Laboratory mice models showed that the ACE2 expression as the receptor of the SARS-CoV-2 decreases with age. Although this result contradicts with low susceptibility of children to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the lung is protected by ACE2 against SARS, influenza A H5N1 virus, respiratory syncytial virus infections. It can be explained that ACE2 in healthy people and children modulates the renin\u2013angiotensin system via cleaving angiotensin (Ang)-II to Ang-1\u20137 to prevent severe acute lung failure. Indeed, the severe lung injury arising from a viral respiratory infection is associated with ACE2 deficiency and increasing of Ang II [17,18].",
