The course may progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure, requiring intensive care. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) may play a supportive role in patients with severe viral pneumonia and early ARDS/acute lung injury. It can act as a bridge to invasive mechanical ventilation, although it is contraindicated in critically ill patients with hemodynamic instability and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome [4]. Transmission of some of these viral infections can convert from droplets to airborne during respiratory therapy.",

Possible aerosol transmission during a nosocomial outbreak of seasonal influenza was temporally related to the application of NIV in an index patient with hypercapnic respiratory failure due to acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient was on a medical ward with an imbalanced indoor airflow [7]. As influenza virus may be contained in fine particles generated during tidal breathing [8], NIV may disperse potentially infected aerosols, especially when patients cough and sneeze frequently, contributing to nosocomial transmission of influenza. Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is well known to spread by the airborne route. A recent study showed that a small number of patients with pulmonary TB (28 %) produced culturable cough aerosols [9].",

The HPS contains a realistic airway and is programmed to remove oxygen and inject carbon dioxide into the system according to a preset respiratory exchange ratio and oxygen consumption. The lung compliance can also be changed to simulate different degrees of lung injury during chest infection. By varying the oxygen consumption (200, 300, and 500 ml/min) and lung compliance (70, 35, and 10 ml/cmH2O), these sets of values produce a range of tidal volumes, respiratory rates, and peak inspiratory flow similar to those of patients with minimal (essentially normal lung function), moderate, or severe lung injury, respectively. For example, lung compliance is set at 35 ml/cm H2O and oxygen consumption at 300 ml/min to mimic mild lung injury. Tidal volume and respiratory rate are regulated so a respiratory exchange ratio of 0.8 is maintained during measurements. Typically, this is achieved with a tidal volume of 300 ml and a respiratory rate of 25 breaths/min [10\u201313]. Lung compliance and airway resistance also responds in a realistic manner to relevant respiratory challenges. The HPS produces an airflow pattern that is close to the in vivo situation. It has been applied in previous studies to simulate human respiration [14\u201317].\n\n",

The oil-based smoke particles, measuring less than 1 \u03bcm in diameter, are known to follow the airflow pattern precisely with negligible slip [18]. The smoke was introduced continuously to the right main bronchus of the HPS. It mixed with alveolar gas and then was exhaled through the airway. Sections through the leakage jet plume were then revealed by a thin, green laser light sheet (532 nm wavelength, continuous-wave mode) created by a diode-pumped solid-state laser (OEM UGH-800 mW; Lambda Pro Technologies, Shanghai, China) with custom cylindrical optics to generate a two-dimensional laser light sheet [10\u201313].",

The background intensity image was subtracted from each frame, pixel by pixel, to remove any stray background light. The pixel intensity values were averaged over all frames to determine the average intensity. The resulting image was the total intensity of light scattered perpendicular to the light sheet by the smoke particles. It was directly proportional to the smoke concentration under the conditions mentioned above. The image was normalized against the highest intensity found within the leakage jet plume to generate normalized particle concentration contours [10\u201313].",
