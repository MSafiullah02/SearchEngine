At our hospital, a quaternary care academic and level one trauma center, we explored digital care delivery methods to reduce unnecessary exposure and conserve PPE. One method involved the deployment of iPads to evaluate and manage patients using a HIPAA-compliant virtual video and voice application.",

Most reported a greater sense of safety with added physical isolation from suspected COVID patients, of respite from donning and doffing PPE multiple times per day, and of stewardship to save PPE for higher risk encounters such as those involving intubation or central line placement. iPad use decreased the frequency and duration of time that a clinician needed to be at the bedside, as the majority of ED faculty reported practice patterns shifting to neither the attending, APP (advanced practice provider) or resident examining at-risk COVID patients in person for those triaged to lower acuity units. The magnitude of reduction of exposure and PPE use for these patients was estimated at 50-75%; few encounters required an MD or APP/resident at the bedside. However, some components of the evaluation still required physical contact for tasks traditionally done by nursing, such as obtaining vital signs, an EKG, or drawing labs.",

Additional challenges include reliability of the patient self-assessment (e.g., selfpalpation of the abdomen)and that virtual evaluation may not be appropriate for all patients (e.g., certain psychiatric patients or patients requiring interventions such as intubation).

Potential exists in the design and architecture of healthcare facilities, and the equipment with which they are outfitted for optimal digital interactions, including 360-degree-view two-way video and surround-sound microphone and audio capabilities. Patient rooms could be equipped with automated note-generation from ambient audio/visual technology to increase work-efficiency and decrease administrative burdens. A video laryngoscope's screen could be linked via Bluetooth to a wall-mounted television inside the room or behind glass doors for remote intubation guidance.",
