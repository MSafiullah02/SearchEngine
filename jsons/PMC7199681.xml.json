His wife, given similar symptoms, had had a positive nasopharyngeal (NP) swab for SARS-CoV-2 three days before he became symptomatic. Medications on admission were notable for valsartan, albuterol, atorvastatin, ixazomib, and lenalidomide. His social history was notable for previous employment in real estate, minimal alcohol use, and no history of tobacco or recreational drug use. He had a pet dog and had returned from Antigua eight weeks prior.",

Physical examination revealed a fatigued elderly gentleman with clear lung fields. Laboratory results were notable for a lymphopenia, acute kidney injury, and elevated D-dimer, further outlined in Table 1\n. Two sets of blood cultures were obtained and ultimately negative. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral patchy airspace opacities. He was provided ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Given clinical suspicion for COVID-19, airborne and droplet precautions were put in place and hydroxychloroquine begun empirically. A NP swab on the day of admission returned negative for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus types 1-4, adenovirus, rhinovirus, and SARS-CoV-2 using the CDC-developed RT-PCR assay. Urine antigen testing for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophilia was negative. Repeat NP swab for SARS-CoV-2 on hospital day four also returned negative, this time using the automated cobas 6800 system. Over the course of hospital days three through five, he had daily fever as high as 39.6 \u00b0C and laboratory results were notable for an LDH of 990 U/L, CPK of 477 U/L, CRP of 166 mg/L, and ferritin >6,000 ng/mL. On hospital day five, after the second negative SARS-CoV-2 NP RT-PCR, he was taken off airborne precautions and transferred off the COVID-19 dedicated unit and to the general medical ward. He had persistent fevers and ongoing cough, myalgias, anosmia, and ageusia. The infectious diseases service was consulted for fever of unknown origin, and recommended repeat SARS-CoV-2 testing given his high pretest probability. He was placed back on COVID-19 precautions and the third test, an expectorated sputum sample for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, again using the CDC-developed assay, returned positive Table 2\n.",

Given a growing appreciation in the literature for both heterogeneity of presentation and disease severity, it is critical to have a clear sense of COVID-19 testing performance (2). It is unclear why our patient\u2019s first two nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 were negative. Possible explanations include improper collection or handling technique, viral load below the detectable limit of the assay, or diminished upper airway viral shedding. The latter possibly reflects the natural history of the disease wherein duration of viral shedding (which may precede symptom onset by several days) was observed to be as few as eight days to as many as 37 (1); additionally, it is conceivable that the patient\u2019s immunocompromised state may have contributed.",

Available data suggest a range of sensitivities that likely increase with repetition. This may relate to varying assays based on the country of origin, as well as the reference standard used for a positive or presumptive positive test (e.g., viral culture, radiographic findings). Table 1 outlines the observed sensitivities from several recent publications ([2], [3], [4], [5]). At the early stages of a novel disease when the clinical sensitivity of a given assay is poorly understood, its analytic sensitivity, or limit of detection (LoD), can offer a useful point of reference and comparability. The LoDs reported across the two assays employed in this patient\u2019s case however were derived from varying methodologies resulting in entirely different units of measurement (RNA copies/\u03bcL vs. TCID50/mL), making early comparisons difficult. The genes targeted in these two assays also differ significantly. While the N1 and N2 genes are included in the CDC assay, Roche\u00ae targets the nonstructural ORF1a gene of SARS-CoV-2 in combination with the E gene (envelope protein) of the broader Sarbecovirus group. The relative clinical sensitivity and specificity of these targets are unknown.",

In an analysis of nine patients with mild COVID-19, W\u00f6lfel and colleagues found that pharyngeal shedding predominated and reached a peak in the first week of symptomatic disease, with upper airway viral load already declining at the time of presentation (6). This observation is consistent with our patient\u2019s negative NP RT-PCR results from illness on days seven and ten. Shedding in sputum, however, continued through the first week of disease and extended as far as 3 weeks after symptoms began in patients with evidence of lung involvement. Based on these observations, the authors theorized a de-isolation protocol that not only considers date from symptom onset as is suggested by CDC (7), but also viral load. In a similar study, To and colleagues sought to ascertain viral load dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the posterior oropharynx and tracheal aspirates, as well as antibody kinetics and the viral genome, by collecting serial swabs from 23 patients (8). They found that viral loads correlated positively with age and peaked shortly after symptom onset and subsequently declined. Of note, they found that in one third of the cohort viral RNA could still be detected from the posterior oropharynx after 20 days. This observation questions the feasibility of incorporating viral load into de-isolation protocols, as it remains unknown whether these patients are continuing to shed live virus versus inactive virions coated in neutralizing antibody.",
