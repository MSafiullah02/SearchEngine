While a debatable practice, several hospitals have successfully implemented related programs .the current MDI canister protocol states that compliance with disinfecting the MDI nozzle is vital [5, 6]. In one case, cultures were taken of the MDI nozzle before and after disinfection with an alcohol prep pad, as well as after treatments were administered. Growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in at least 5% of the cultures with all three types of specimens, including those taken after the nozzle was disinfected with an alcohol prep pad. In another case, the hospital assessed the failure to wipe the canister nozzle with an alcohol prep pad before patient use; 1 of 18 (5.5%) cultures resulted in the growth of Streptococci Group D (Enterococci) [7]. A discussion may need to take place in each institution that includes Doctors, infection control, and pharmacy to agree on the best way to implement and ensure safety.\n",

During the COVID pandemic, there has been a drastic increase in the use of MDI inhalers, which has led to a decrease in availability and a break in the supply chain. Hospital teams need to be proactive and start collecting the used MDI when appropriate and sterilize it following the provided procedure and keep in separate stock in case it is required. To minimize the risk of contamination, a discussion may need to take place in each institution that includes Doctors, infection control, SPD team and pharmacy to agree on the best way to implement and ensure safety (Fig. 1) (Table 1).",
