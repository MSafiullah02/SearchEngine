Five months into the outbreak there is an impressive number of studies reporting antibody kinetics and RNA shedding dynamics, but extensive variation in detection assays, study group demographics, and laboratory protocols has presented a challenge for inferring the true biological patterns. Here, we combine existing data on SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM and RNA kinetics using a formal quantitative approach that enables integration of 3,214 data points from 516 individuals, published in 22 studies. This allows us to determine the mean values and distributions of IgG and IgM seroconversion times and titer kinetics, and to characterize how antibody and RNA detection probabilities change during the early phase of infection. We observe extensive variation in antibody response patterns and RNA detection patterns, explained by both individual heterogeneity and protocol differences such as targeted antigen and sample type.",

Serologythe measurement of serum antibodies -provides crucial data for understanding key aspects of infection . At the level of populations, serologic data can provide insights into the spread of the virus by enabling estimation of the overall attack rate, and seroprevalence estimates can elucidate the potential for herd immunity (Stringhini et al. 2020 ). In addition, these estimates are essential for developing accurate mathematical models of virus transmission dynamics, which provide the foundation for policies to reopen societies (German et al. 2020; Kissler et al. 2020; Krsak et al. 2020) . At the level of individuals, the presence and concentration of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are indicators of past exposure, providing insights into incidence over a much wider temporal window than other metrics. When considered jointly with PCR testing to detect viral shedding, antibodies substantially improve the probability of detecting present and past infections (Prager et al. 2019) , which is highly valuable given that RNA shedding is typically limited to a relatively brief infectious period, and because PCR sensitivity varies considerably with infection severity and biological sample type (Yongchen et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020b) . Assessment of the levels of different antibody types (e.g. IgG, IgM) may even be used to infer approximately when individuals became infected (Chang et al. 2005; Borremans et al. 2016; Du et al. 2020) , while detection of neutralizing antibodies may indicate protection from reinfection (Ni et al. 2020 ).",

When these key factors are known, serologic data become a powerful tool for inferring infection attack rate and transmission dynamics in the population (Winter & Hegde 2020) . Five months into the pandemic, a remarkable number of serologic studies on the initial immune response against SARS-CoV-2 have been published. These studies were conducted in different laboratories, used different assays and sampling methods, and were performed on different patient groups that showed different manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Kontou et al. 2020; Lassauni\u00e8re et al. 2020; Whitman et al. 2020 ). This extensive variation arising from different sources creates a significant challenge for integrating existing data into one coherent picture of antibody kinetics and viral RNA shedding following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We investigated how these variables are affected by disease severity, assay type and targeted antigen, and how patterns differ between IgG and IgM. We also assessed how antibody level kinetics relate to the probability of detecting viral RNA in various biological samples. For all variables we estimated mean values as well as observed variation in order to provide the complete picture required to interpret serological data, inform mitigation strategies and parameterize mathematical models of pathogen transmission while accounting for uncertainty. This formal integration approach enabled us to leverage 3,214 data points from 516 individuals with symptoms ranging from asymptomatic to critical, published in 22 studies, resulting in a quantitative synthesis of diverse data on anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody patterns and RNA shedding during the early phase of infection.",

Briefly, parameters a and b were fit separately for each individual, and parameter c was shared by all individuals (i.e. the same rate for each individual). Posterior means of the parameters were used for further analyses and for plotting, and can be generated using the accompanying R code (Supplementary Information). Data were combined into subsets depending on the measure of interest (assay, targeted antigen, disease severity). Peak antibody level timing was approximated as the time at which the level reaches 95% of the maximum level (a).",

We find that IgG and IgM can be detected as early as 0 dpo in 10 -20% of patients, which indicates that seroconversion can happen at, and likely before the onset of detectable symptoms. To our knowledge seroconversion prior to symptom onset has not been observed, which is likely due to the fact that such cases are typically not under investigation. By integrating a wide range of data sources we find more extensive variation in seroconversion timing than previously observed, and importantly it was possible to quantify the distributions around the mean seroconversion times (Haveri et al. 2020; Huang et al. 2020; Zhao et al. 2020) . One potential caveat related to any type of result reported as time since symptom onset is that variation in the incubation period (time between infection and symptom onset) can affect the estimated timing of antibody kinetics and RNA shedding. The mean incubation period is estimated to be around 7-8 days, with a standard deviation of 4.4 . The clear antibody and RNA detection patterns we observe here suggest that the effect of this variation does not obscure broad patterns, but if incubation period does differ in certain groups of individuals, relative results may be affected. This could indeed be the case for disease severity, as mild cases are estimated to have a longer incubation period (8.3 days) than severe cases (6.5 days) ).",

Here, we did not detect any significant effects of disease severity on antibody patterns. For IgM, this matches findings from a 28-case cohort study, where seroconversion appeared to be the same for severe and non-severe cases ). In that same study however, IgG data on 45 cases suggested that seroconversion may be earlier for severe cases, and it was hypothesized that disease severity may affect antibody response characteristics. Similarly, earlier seroconversion in severe cases has been observed for SARS-CoV-1 (Lee et al. 2006) , but this result was not consistent across studies (Chan et al. 2005) . The consensus patterns from our larger integrative study suggest that if disease severity is indeed linked to antibody response, the effect is subtle and sensitive to other sources of variation, explaining the inconsistencies seen across studies. In addition, if disease severity indeed does not significantly affect antibody patterns and protective immunity develops even in mild cases, these cases would be substantial contributors to herd immunity development. This finding may also be important for vaccine efficacy, however it is not yet known whether IgG or IgM development correlates with protective immunity (Altmann et al. 2020) , although we do observe that neutralizing antibodies appear at an even higher rate than IgG or IgM (Figure 2a) .",

While detection probability for faecal and upper respiratory tract samples are nearly as high at symptom onset as lower respiratory tract samples, it decreases much more rapidly, with the lowest average detection probability for upper respiratory samples. Nevertheless, it appears that by 30 dpo detection probability approaches zero for all sample types, although it is important to note that the dataset did not include lower respiratory samples beyond day 29, which means that the true shedding endpoint in lower respiratory samples could not be determined. These results match those from multiple studies Sethuraman et al. 2020; Tan et al. 2020; .

Antibody detection probability While estimates of seroconversion time provide information about the first moment at which antibodies can be detected, changes in detection probability over time provide useful information about the proportion of individuals that has detectable antibodies. Sample sizes for observed and interpolated data that can be used for antibody detection probability (see methods) are 8,053 for IgG and 7,935 for IgM, with daily mean sample sizes of 224 and 220, respectively.
