            "text": "Here, we report the clinical features of a cluster of seven patients suffered from pneumonia associated with the SARS-Cov-2 in Lishui City of Zhejiang Province, China. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and treatment data were collected through detailed interviews with each patient and electronic medical records. Laboratory confirmation of the virus was performed using RT-PCR by Lishui Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Case definitions of confirmed COVID-19 are in accordance with the interim guidance from a rapid advice guideline. 4 The first enrolled patient (Patient A) returned to Lishui from Wenzhou on Jan 18, 2020 and participated a house-warming banquet. Two days later, he suffered with fever, chill, cough and generalized weakness, and was hospitalized on Jan 23, later diagnosed as COVID-19 on Jan 25. Patient B, father of patient A, presented with cough and fever on Jan 21 and was diagnosed on Jan 27. On the same day, patient C was diagnosed as COVID-19 with primary symptoms of cough and sputum. Tracking the medical history of patient C, he began to cough on Jan 16 (two days before the banquet) when he was still in Yongkang, a city adjacent to Lishui. Patient D developed a bad cough on Jan 22 and patient E presented with similar symptom on Jan 26. They were diagnosed on Feb 1 and Feb 2, respectively. Patient F was hospitalized on Jan 30 with fever, chill, cough and generalized weakness and diagnosed as COVID-19 on Feb 1. All the above six patients attended the same house-warming banquet. Oddly enough, patient G, who did not attend the same party, had fever on Feb 1 and was soon diagnosed on Feb 2. Tracing the history of epidemiology, she had dinner with patient C on Jan 24. It is worth noting that the cluster of seven patients did not go to Wuhan or Hubei province in the preceding 14 days, and they denied any exposure with wild animals, confirmed COVID-19 patients or febrile patients ( Fig. 1 ) . Two possible scenarios of transmission exist. The first and most likely scenario is that patient A acquired the infection from an asymptomatic patient in Wenzhou (a city with most cases in Zhejiang province) before Jan 18, 2020. This period overlapped with the time period during the announcement of the first case of COVID-19 in Wenzhou (symptom onset on Jan 4, diagnosed on Jan 21) according to the Zhejiang Provincial Health Committee ( http: //www.zjwjw.gov.cn/col/col1659205/index.html ). The other five patients (B \u223cF) attended the same house-warming banquet and had lunch together in a crowded, noisy hotel restaurant with patient A. Even more, patient B and C had taken the same car with patient A from Lishui back to Qingyuan. As a result, all the five patients were in close contact with patient A, who most likely had been infected before. Then patient G was infected because she was exposed to patient C. The second scenario is that patient C acquired the infection in Yongkang, because he had begun coughing two days before the banquet. As described in the first scenario, other patients were all in close contact with him and got infected. Though the median incubation varies from 3 \u223c6.4 days according to the previous studies, 5 , 6 it is sometimes difficult to calculate the incubation period accurately such as patient A and patient C. Regardless of how the virus transmitted among the seven patients, it further indicated that the SARS-Cov-2 infection could cause clustering onset. 7 Quarantine and keeping social distance paly pivotal roles in the prevention of local outbreak of COVID-19. 8 The exact transmission mode still needs to be further studied.",
