We have used this technique for a couple of weeks and also used it during perioperative gastroscopies in the context of gastroesophageal surgery. I understand that Drs Lee and Evans had a contamination of the outside of the sleeve cover, had issues with the securing of the bite block on the sleeve, observed humidity on the inside of the sleeve, and had difficulties securing the TEE probe to the frame. I would like to thank the authors for having pointed out their difficulties. Here, I will clarify the key points of the procedure.",

The bite block (Olympus Canada, Inc., Richmond Hill, ON, Canada) used at our institution ( Figure, panel A) has an oval-shaped opening, a bigger flange outside the mouth and a smaller flange inside the mouth The sleeve available at our institution (EZ-Sert\u00d2, Microtek Medical Inc., Columbus, OH, USA) is 240 cm and has stretchable latex at the end with an opening of 10 mm. It has a small piece of tape to secure the sleeve around the camera. The sleeve opening is grasped from inside, stretched (panel B), and placed over the outer flange of the bite block (panel C). At this point, the sleeve stretches back and is secured to the mouthpiece. For additional safety, the tape is secured over the mouthpiece (panel D). Finally, the TEE probe is lubricated and inserted in the sleeve and the sleeve is unwrapped (panel E). Using appropriate personal protective equipment and double gloves, the mouthpiece is inserted in the patient's mouth (panel F) and the lateral opening of the mouth is closed with transparent dressings (Tegaderm TM ; 3 M Healthcare, Maplewood, MN, USA) The outside gloves are immediately discarded.",

The TEE examination is performed without any part of the probe exposed. Upon completion, the TEE probe is completely withdrawn in the sleeve leaving the mouthpiece in place (panel H). Using appropriate PPE and double gloves, the mouthpiece and side dressing are removed from the patient's mouth and, for further safety, the bite block is immediately enveloped with the distal part of the sleeve (panel I). The TEE probe is sent with mouthpiece and sleeve in a designated transport box for reprocessing. Using appropriate PPE, the reprocessing team remove and discard the sleeve with the mouthpiece ''en bloc'' in the dirty area.",
