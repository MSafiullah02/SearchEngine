Bacteroides species (primarily B. jragilis) were isolated as described previously [2] . In brief, fecal samples were streaked directly on PINN medium, which allowed growth of several species of Bacteroides but inhibited growth of most other enteric bacteria. After anaerobic growth (GasPak\u00ae anaerobe system; BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md) for 48 hr, two to four colonies with the characteristic colonial appearance of B. fragilis were subcultured to tryptose blood agar (Difco Laboratories, Detroit) to ensure purity and were presumptively speciated with use of catalase and indole tests and rhamnose, trehalose, and mannitol fermentation [6, 7] . Confirmatory testing of 29 isolates of Bacteroides species was done at the Anaerobe Laboratory, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Blacksburg).",
