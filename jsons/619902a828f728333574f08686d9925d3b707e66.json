The BLS has extensive documentation of crewmembers' work-related injuries and illnesses, and its analysts provide extensive information upon request. A major union representing cabin crew collected copies of these injury and illness logs from 13 airlines, and calculated that 10% of the 31 422 employed cabin crew had reported a work-related illness or a recordable injury [5] . The national average across industries for the same year was 3.1% [6] . Although the data that the BLS collects are useful, there is evidence that the lists of air quality-related illnesses currently maintained by the airlines underestimate the true rate, even of reported incidents, highlighting the need for independent oversight of any data collection. Some major government-funded reports have been published on the subject of aircraft air quality [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .

Smoking is prohibited on domestic flights in most countries, and is restricted on most international flights; for example, airlines in the UK, Germany, Italy, and Russia have imposed a voluntary smoking ban on international flights, while airlines in France and the Ukraine allow smoking in sections of the aircraft, depending on the destination [17] . Even in countries that have enacted smoking bans on all commercial flights, the majority of currently employed crewmembers have been exposed to ETS in the aircraft cabin during their careers. ETS exposure for a full-time cabin crewmember on smoking flights has been described as equivalent to living with a one-pack-per-day smoker [18] . Research into tobacco-related diseases among crewmembers is currently being conducted in the US by the Flight Attendant Medical Research Institute, funded by a settlement from a 1991 lawsuit filed against tobacco companies.

Although carbon dioxide itself is not considered to be hazardous at the concentrations reported in these surveys, it is an indicator of outside air supply, and elevated levels have been associated with an increased prevalence of non-specific symptoms reported by occupants in ground based environments [24] . \u2022 Low per person recirculated airflow: The per person volume of filtered, recirculated supply air is considerably lower on aircraft (7-10 CFM; 3.3-4.7 L/s) than in buildings (70 CFM; 33 L/s), raising concerns about exposure to increased airborne levels of particulate, including viruses and bacteria. It is possible that the quality of recirculated air on aircraft may be higher than in buildings, although the trade off between volume and quality of filtered, recirculated air has not been quantified. \u2022 Airborne contaminants from off-gassing surfaces: The per person \"building\" surface area is considerably smaller on aircraft than in building environments. If surface off-gassing is the primary cause of reported symptoms, then fewer aircraft occupants should report symptoms, all other things being equal. However, it may not be possible to draw a direct comparison because the key sources of off-gassing surfaces are different on aircraft (e.g., lavatory, galley kitchen) than in buildings (e.g., photocopier). \u2022 Airborne contaminants from aircraft occupants: The occupant-generated contaminant load per unit volume of space is considerably greater on aircraft than in building environment.

There were two outbound flights and two return flights a month later, by which time the patient's condition was reported to have worsened. On the first three flights, a total of 14 contacts had positive tuberculin skin prick tests, although of these, 13 had other risk factors for TB. However, on the last flight (lasting 8.75 h), 15 contacts had positive tuberculin skin tests and, of these, six had no other risk factors for TB and were seated in the same cabin section as the index case, four within two rows of her. The observed pattern of infection within the cabin suggests the potential for \"drift\" of infected air between rows. The absence of reported skin-test conversions in other cabin sections implies that bacteria were not transmitted through the aircraft's air recirculation system.",

Sampling data collected by the US National Aerospace Administration in 1977 indicated significantly elevated ozone levels on the B-747-SP aircraft compared to the standard B-747, and the cabin ozone levels increased as the flights progressed. In one survey, self-reported symptoms consistent with ozone exposure were reported three to four times more often by cabin crew employed by airlines operating high altitude, long-distance flights, than by those employed by airlines operating low altitude, short duration flights [85] . Symptoms included burning sensations in the throat and eyes, chest pain, coughing, shortness of breath, and wheezing. The study was limited by a relatively low response rate (61% of active crewmembers) and the airlines' refusal to allow in-cabin monitoring. Another survey reported a significant association with self-reported ozonerelated symptoms and 747-SP flights, although the survey response rate was again low [86] .",

Historically, DDT and Sevin have been applied in the aircraft cabin [88] .
