Over the last decade, there have been several instances where outbreaks of infectious disease, as public health emergencies, have repeatedly challenged military policies for preparedness. In addition to localized outbreaks, international pandemics have become a focal concern because of their impact on available resources in both civilian and military health care systems. Since the 1918 influenza, the United States has helped mitigate the spread of disease during pandemics, but recent global epidemics have shifted the focus to strengthened preparedness for such public health emergencies.1",

The Military Health System (MHS), which maintains health care services for U.S. armed services personnel and their families, has extensive experience with influenza disease epidemics, such as the 1976 outbreak of H1N1 that was detected after the death of an Army recruit in Fort Dix, New Jersey.3 This outbreak resulted in a mass vaccination program across the United States and initiated a collaborative approach between CHAMPUS (now TRICARE, the system of health care plans for the U.S. Armed Forces and beneficiaries), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and local/regional health departments. Twenty years after the Fort Dix incident, an outbreak of influenza A (H3N2) on a Navy ship led to the discovery of an antigenically distinct H3N2 influenza virus from the 1995/1996 seasonal vaccine administered to military personnel for a different vaccine strain.4 This outbreak on the USS Arkansas reached an incidence rate of 42%, infecting 232 of the ship's personnel. In addition to past outbreaks of influenza, threats of an avian influenza outbreak (avian influenza A, H5N1) surfaced in 2005, prompting the DoD to coordinate with the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the Department of Homeland Security to develop a national pandemic preparedness strategy.5 Other types of communicable diseases have similarly challenged military preparedness policies such as outbreaks of pertussis,6 occupational exposures to blood-borne pathogens or enteroviruses,7 and food-borne infectious diarrhea.8",

Influenza immunization rendered in civilian settings were not tracked as non-AD beneficiaries may obtain immunization through multiple sources that may not be entered as MDR claims data (e.g., employment, free public health programs). Our analytical dataset consisted of outpatient encounters, inpatient stays, and medication records rendered through MTFs and civilian care, October 2004 through April 2010. We included encounter records if they had specific and nonspecific codes associated with ILI, influenza immunization, and associated treatments. Individuals with multiple influenza-related encounters were only counted once per season. Each record contained the month/year of the service encounter, the patient pseudoidentifier, sex, age, beneficiary category, branch of service, state of residence, and type of TRICARE enrollment plan (MTF Prime, Managed Care Support Contractor Prime, and non-Prime). The final dataset was aggregated to person-level records to enable characterization of the 2009 H1N1 influenza patient.

Table III indicates where the total of $156.7M was spent on ILI from July 2009 to January 2010. This total was approximately $100M more than projected for these months during a normal influenza season. Table III includes $15.9M for DoD-purchased H1N1 vaccine that could not be allocated in the patient-level cost data. Treatment costs accounted for 58% of the $100M overall cost impact, whereas immunization-related costs, including the DoD purchase of vaccine, accounted for 42%.",

Our findings closely mirror those based on U.S. civilian populations, i.e., heavy reliance on emergency departments15 and high rates of ILI among beneficiaries less than age 18.16 The increased rates of health care utilization and costs observed in the DoD pediatric population is particularly concerning, given a new report that concludes that the nation's capacity to care for pediatric populations during the 2009/2010 influenza season was marginally adequate; had the 2009/2010 H1N1 pandemic been more virulent, tertiary pediatric facilities would have been overwhelmed.17 Further, in contrast to our findings, the U.S. civilian population saw a heavier burden of ILI among young adults.18 Most young adults included in our DoD population were AD personnel, who, unlike their civilian counterparts, were required to be vaccinated for H1N1.",

One strategy, based on estimated models when immunization resources are scarce and the influenza incidence is declining, is to consider immunizing school-age children as well as high-risk adults.20 Although DoD has clear requirements for vaccinating AD personnel, there are no such directives for vaccinating family members. Another strategy is to consider closing elementary schools on DoD installations, the length of closure dependent on pandemic severity as modeled elsewhere using civilian schools.21 In addition, to assist fiscal and resource planning, we recommend time trends that compare rates and costs to previous influenza seasons be conducted annually for each MTF. Finally, we recommend that future study be directed to evaluating effective models of triaging individuals who present with ILI symptoms, particularly for those presenting in emergency departments.",

            "text": "Our study has several limitations. Our inclusion of nonspecific vaccine administration codes in the MDR may have captured vaccines unrelated to influenza. Only vaccines administered in the health care setting are captured in the MDR, but some immunizations are administered to service members in the field; thus, total vaccine-related costs for DoD are underestimated in our study. Cost allocation data, particularly for care rendered in the military hospitals, were not specific to immunization clinics or different types of immunizations. Immunizations or treatment for ILI may have occurred as part of a broader health care visit, and ILI costs may not have been identified. Moreover, our cost estimation methodology may not have generated an accurate estimate for all events because we only had cost data through January 2010. To some extent, comparison with prior influenza seasons mitigates the impact of this limitation, assuming that health care practices persisted across the 2004\u20132009 influenza seasons. Yet another limitation, out of concern for patient privacy, is that we did not conduct analysis at the MTF level. Therefore, we neither examined the prevalence of H1N1 cases, health care utilization, or costs by individual MTFs nor consider MTF facility size, the number of available beds, and size of outpatient clinics in relation to the number of cases received at a particular facility. Finally, while the cost of care provided in civilian settings is directly calculated from government payments/costs at a claim level, military care costs are reported in aggregate (by clinic) and then fitted and allocated to the detail \u201cvisit\u201d level; hence, military care costs are inexact comparisons to civilian costs.",
