Among them, acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (ANPs) pioneered with (S)-9-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenine ((S)-HPMPA) [2] in 1986 by Anton\u00edn Hol\u00fd and Erik De Clercq, forms a key class of drugs active against various DNA viruses as well as against retroviruses. However, those compounds suffer from limitations such as their reduced cell penetration (the free phosphonic acid form is negatively charged at physiological pH) as well as from nephrotoxicity. This has led to extensive search for new ANPs as well as to the development of prodrug approaches [3,4] for enhanced bioavailability and cell internalisation [[5], [6], [7], [8]]. Several ANP prodrugs were marketed, such as adevofir dipivoxyl (bis-POM PMEA) [9,10] for the treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV), tenefovir disoproxyl (bis-POC PMPA) [11] or the newly tenofovir alafenamide [[12], [13], [14]] for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and HBV [15,16].",

            "text": "Over the last decade, our group has developed a new family of ANPs based on a trans-but-2-enyl phosphonate scaffold [17]. Compounds were directly obtained as prodrugs by a highly convergent and modular approach based on the powerful olefin acyclic cross metathesis (CM) between various allylphosphonate synthons bearing biolabile groups and N1- (or N9) crotyl (or allyl) pyrimidines or purines. This approach showed a remarkable breakthrough for the synthesis of nucleoside prodrugs compared to the known linear approaches, which suffer from low yields. It is also clear from the literature that the choice of a prodrug has a direct impact on its targeting and cell release and greatly influences the overall outcome and efficiency of the parent drug [[18], [19], [20]]. Thus, following this synthetic pathway, we have obtained several prodrugs [[21], [22], [23], [24], [25]] including the most commonly used carbonyloxymethyl pronucleotides (pivaloyloxymethyl- or POM, isopropyloxycarbonyloxymethyl- or POC), but also the alkoxyalkyl monoester (hexadecyloxypropyl or HDP, octadecyloxyethyl or ODE) [26]. Several of these (E)-but-2-enyl ANPs prodrugs exhibited remarkable antiviral activity against DNA and RNA viruses in submicromolar concentrations. The bis-(POM)-(E)-TbutP (1) and the prodrugs 2\u20134 were all very active against several herpesviruses [i.e. herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV)], representing a new potential antiviral lead.",

The desired products are often isolated with poor yields (<3%) to traces as stated for the preparation of phosphonoamidate prodrug of tenofovir (TAF) [30,31] In order to avoid these low yields, our strategy to the targeted phenyl phosphonoamidate of (E)-but-2-enyl ANPs, was to react the allyl phenylphosphonoamidate with a N1-crotylated nucleobase under acyclic cross metathesis (CM), which is quite challenging taking into account the poisoning effect of nitrogens on CM ruthenium catalysts [32]. Any attempt to obtain the desired allylic phosphonoamidates, by the shortest strategy involving the introduction of allyl group on the phosphorodichloridate 5 to give the desired monoalkenylated compound 6, failed. In our hands as, despite several conditions, only the product of dialkylation was obtained, when observed (Scheme 1\n).",

Confluent cell cultures (or nearly confluent for MDCK cells) in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID50 of virus (1 CCID50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or with 20 plaque forming units (PFU) (for VZV) in the presence of varying concentrations (100, 20, \u2026\u03bcM) of the test compounds. Viral cytopathic effect (CPE) or plaque formation (VZV) was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC50 or compound concentration required reducing virus-induced CPE or viral plaque (VZV) plaque formation by 50%. The minimal cytotoxic concentration (MCC) of the compounds was defined as the compound concentration that caused a microscopically visible alteration of cell morphology. Alternatively, the cytostatic activity of the test compounds was measured based on inhibition of cell growth. HEL cells were seeded at a rate of 5 \u00d7 103 cells/well into 96-well microtiter plates and allowed to proliferate for 24 h. Then, medium containing different concentrations of the test compounds was added. After 3 days of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the cell number was determined with a Coulter counter. The cytostatic concentration was calculated as the CC50, or the compound concentration required to reduce cell proliferation by 50% relative to the number of cells in the untreated controls.",
