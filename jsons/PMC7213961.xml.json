SARS-Cov-2 causes a pneumonic respiratory illness known as COVID-19, with the potential for severe cardiovascular damage. The high infectivity rate has led to rapid escalation of cases around the world. COVID-19 demonstrates a higher mortality rate amongst patients with pre-existing illness, especially those with cardiovascular disease. This has prompted a rapid evaluation of routine cardiac electrophysiology (EP) and cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED) services within Australia. Major international societies (Heart Rhythm Society, British Heart Rhythm Society), have urgently released guidelines as live documents for the provision of such services [1].",

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic requires rapid re-evaluation of EP and CIED services, as outlined below. 1We recommend mandatory training of all staff involved in EP and CIED services in proper \u201cdonning\u201d and \u201cdoffing\u201d of personal protective equipment (PPE).2We recommend general screening of all patients scheduled to undergo an intervention or in-person interaction with staff delivering EP and CIED services. We recommend adherence to local hospital protocols for such screening methods. Patients could be divided into low, intermediate and high-risk patients as per the CSANZ consensus guidelines for interventional cardiology services [2].aEach network, hospital or local health district has developed such screening tools, and these should be followed.b\u201cLow exposure risk\u201d patients could be brought to the catheter laboratory with staff observing appropriate PPE during procedure performance (may be routine care in this case) and cleaning procedures applied as per usual practice.c\u201cHigh exposure risk\u201d patients should have EP and CIED procedures deferred until complete resolution of their illness, unless there is a compelling indication that an urgent procedure would alter their short-term prognosis.dWhen patients are in the unknown category, for example, non-English speaking patients, and there is an urgent clinical need, it is appropriate to treat as \u201chigh exposure risk\u201d of COVID-19.\n3We strongly recommend that all physicians involved with the provision of services related to EP and CIED management hold a forum within their network, hospital, practice, or local health district to discuss and tailor these guidelines to their local models of service delivery, with frequent visitation of updates.4Each of the networks should work closely with their hospital or network\u2019s established COVID-19 Taskforce group, ideally comprising of one or more of: cardiology department heads, EP leads, CIED program heads, infectious disease specialists, population health physicians, emergency department physicians, intensive care physicians, nurses and allied health staff, industry partners and hospital administration to formulate a plan for ongoing management of EP and CIED procedures and clinics, using these guidelines as a reference. The group should meet at weekly intervals to ensure maintenance of appropriateness criteria, urgency and alignment of practices with the local outbreak response phase.5We recognise that such infrastructure may not exist in private practices but advise that a framework be established within one or more partners within the group, and with the host hospital where consultation and procedures are performed. Where not possible or practical, such as in the instance of solo practitioners, we advise that the group could adhere to the majority of these recommendations, as far as practically feasible.6\nTeleconferencing is recommended to avoid cross infection of the leadership group.7We recommend networks nominate a group leader within the network who will coordinate and implement the action plan, and an assistant lead who should monitor national and global trends closely, and adapt these, where feasible, to local and national recommendations.8We recommend the nomination of a triaging lead physician (1 EP, 1 CIED program) who works with a triage nurse or allied health staff member to review clinical need and urgency of elective procedures.9We recommend that non-urgent elective cardiac electrophysiology and CIED implant procedures be deferred to preserve resources for urgent cases and to allow catheterisation labs time to prepare for the use of PPE. We suggest inpatient procedures be performed as quickly as possible, if they cannot be deferred for a minimum of 1-3 months.10We suggest that all outpatient consultations should be altered to telephone or teleconference as soon as possible to reduce in-person interaction of vulnerable patients and/or vulnerable physicians. If feasible, outpatient services should remain to support general practices and emergency department (ED) referrals.11\nElectronic medical records of arrhythmia patients will need to be available in a format to be shared rapidly with ED physicians, intensive care physicians, general practitioners, and the rural medical workforce.12We suggest weekly or fortnightly review of upcoming schedule of clinics and procedures with the aim of identifying patients that:acan be safely rescheduled for a follow up or a procedure after 1-3 months.bcan be invited to a virtual visit via teleconference.cmust be seen face-to-face.\n\n",

Several billing codes have been released by the Federal Government to help facilitate this arrangement (http://www.mbsonline.gov.au/internet/mbsonline/publishing.nsf/Content/news)5We suggest deferring routine in-hospital and in-person device interrogations in stable patients, with chronic indications for device therapy and sufficient battery longevity (>9 months).6When there is a need to confirm whether therapies (anti-tachycardia pacing/shock) have been delivered in patients with implanted cardiac defibrillators, remote monitoring and/or manual transmissions are preferred. For each patient that has experienced defibrillator therapy, the treating physician should undertake an individualised risk assessment and then decide how best to manage their patient. Options might include telehealth review, in-person clinic review or rarely, hospital admission.7In patients with implanted cardiac devices with suspected lead malfunction or battery issues, the treating physician should undertake an individualised risk assessment before deciding how best to manage their patient. Options might include, telehealth review, in-person clinic review or rarely, hospital admission.8During in-person device checks we encourage the use of wireless communication technology by CIED allied staff to maintain a safe distance (>1.5 metres). In addition, we encourage limitation of the number of people present during the device check (i.e. only patient, clinician and CIED allied health staff). To minimise the duration of contact for a device check, we suggest device data is downloaded, saved and reviewed away from the patient.9Where feasible, remote monitoring / remote interrogation (manual transmissions) should be used for routine follow up of stable patients.10Where feasible, the immediate post implant follow-up should be done remotely, with scar review via photo, or live audio-visual technology.11In patients with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-conditional devices requiring urgent MRI scanning we recommend use of automatic reprogramming functions where available.12Perioperative reprogramming of CIEDs is only necessary for [3], [4]:13Surgery within 15 cm radius of the CIED (generator) where a magnet cannot be applied.14Procedures above the iliac crest, and where patient positioning would prevent easy securing of a magnet if required (in pacing-dependent patients, those with significant baseline bradycardia or to deactivate anti-tachycardia therapies in implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs).15Pacing-dependent ICD patients for procedures above the iliac crest.16A routine CIED check following surgery is not required. A CIED check is only required following surgery if there is ECG evidence of unexpected device malfunction whilst the patient is monitored.17For patients in whom in-hospital or ambulatory in-person interrogation is absolutely critical or necessary, we recommend screening for symptoms or history of exposure to COVID-19. We recommend categorising patients as per CSANZ interventional guidelines prior to the interrogation procedure (Low, Intermediate and high risk) [2], and utilising PPE as per the local hospital protocol. Wherever possible, in-person device interrogation should be delayed until the patient is deemed no longer infectious by the appropriate treating team, according to local or national protocols.18We recommend that each department should quarantine a single set of programmers for in-person evaluation of all patients during the pandemic. These programmers should be stored in a separate area. The programmer is to be cleaned with disinfectants approved by hospital protocols to have activity against COVID-19 before and after each interrogation and at the beginning and the end of the day. Consider covering the programmer interrogation wand with a transoesophageal probe cover, sterile wand sleeve or simply a plastic bag to prevent it from touching the patient and the surrounding area. This would need to be changed between patients.19Whilst individual hospitals will have their own protocols, we recommend that staff involved in care of patients with implanted devices wear surgical scrubs (or similar garments) which are laundered daily, and dedicated shoes which are not worn outside the clinical setting.20Where necessary, ED and hospital wards should have access to on-demand device monitoring systems that are available (e.g. Medtronic Carelink Express, Abbott Merlin on Demand). Where indicated, device monitoring for patients attending ED should be performed using available on-demand systems. In all other situations, the patient\u2019s cardiologist or the on-call cardiologist should be contacted. We recommend that device company representatives are not to be contacted first-line.21In the event of end-of-life management of a patient with terminal disease with or due to COVID-19 and an ICD in situ, consider asking the treating team to secure a clinical magnet to the skin over the ICD where possible, rather than using the programmer. ICD deactivation cannot be performed remotely. We recommend that company representatives minimise their presence during device implants and at clinics, and to minimise travel between multiple centres, to reduce risk of potential exposure and transmission. If deemed necessary for a procedure, we recommend that each centre have a designated representative, where feasible, to assist with implants. The number of personnel during an implant should be minimised.22Each device company has released its own working guidelines for the COVID-19 pandemic which will be complementary to this document. These working guidelines can be obtained from the company representative responsible for each region. We will endeavour to work in concert with device companies to deliver a consistent message to physicians.\n",

Although small studies and anecdotal reports suggest that these may be useful, large scale randomised controlled data is lacking. The use of heart rate monitors (e.g. Fitbit, Garmin watch) are unlikely to be useful in this setting and is discouraged.6In the rare instance that ambulatory Holter monitoring and/or stress testing is the ONLY option for investigation of a patient, advice listed in Item 7 of Domain 1 above should be followed. Equipment must undergo a thorough clean before and after each use using hospital approved disinfectants that are active against COVID-19.

Troponin T (TnT) elevation likely represents myocardial injury from either myocarditis, infarction with plaque rupture or diffuse ischaemia from hypoxia. Mortality among patients with CVD and elevated TnT levels was 69.44% (25 of 36), compared to 7.62% (8 of 105) among patients without CVD and acute myocardial injury. Patients with CVD were more prone to TnT elevation (54.5% vs 13.2%), and patients with elevated TnT had more frequent malignant arrhythmias. The overall incidence of VT or VF in this cohort of sick patients with frequent underlying CVD (and a total mortality of 23%) was 5.9%. VT/VF was much more likely in the group with elevated TnT (17.3% vs 1.5%). Events of asystole were not described [12].

However, it is safer to use than chloroquine. Cases of torsades de pointes secondary to this drug are published. The half-life of the drug is very long, and the risk is related to either over dosage acutely or high dose long-term usage. Hydroxychloroquine is being used in combination with the antimicrobial azithromycin in clinical trials and shown to reduce viral load [14]. Azithromycin has anti-inflammatory effects and is an antibiotic which may cause long QT and Torsade de Pointes.
