Multiplication of HRVs occurs in the cytoplasm of the host cell. To produce infection, HRVs must first attach to specific cellular receptors embedded in the plasma membrane. Ninety percent of HRVs immunogenic variants use as receptor intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), a cell surface glycoprotein that promotes intercellular signaling in processes derived from inflammation response. As HRV receptor, ICAM-1 positions the virus to within striking distance of the membrane, and then triggers a conformational change in the virus that ultimately results in delivery of the viral RNA genome into the cytoplasm, across a lipid bilayer. The interaction between ICAM-1 and HRVs has been analyzed by the combination of crystal structures of HRVs and ICAM-1 fragments with electron microscopy reconstructions of the complexes. The resulting molecular models are useful to address questions about receptor recognition, binding specificity, and mechanisms by which ICAM-1 induces virus uncoating. 9",

Hypervariable surface residues coincide with the binding sites of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, and mutations at these sites allow the virus to escape the neutralization effect. On the basis of these residue conservation patterns, the canyon was proposed as the receptor binding site (Rossmann et al., 1985; Rossmann, 1989) . It was also suggested that HRVs could hide their receptor binding site inside canyons or depressions, inaccessible to bulkier antibodies, while mutating the external residues outside the canyon to elude the host's immune surveillance. These postulates form the basis of what became known as the canyon hypothesis (Rossmann, 1989) . Confirmation of the canyon as receptor binding site was provided by mutational analysis of specific residues in the canyon (Colonno et al., 1988) , and by the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstruction of a complex of HRV 16 with a two-domain fragment of ICAM-1 (Olson et al., 1993) .",

            "text": "ICAM-1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein with an extracellular part composed of several immunoglobulin (Ig) domains arranged end-to-end. Ig domains are characteristic building blocks of antibodies. The structure of an Ig domain can be described as two antiparallel [3-sheets packed tightly against each other, connected through several loops following a well-defined topology, and linked by one or two disulfide bridges (Harpaz and Chothia, 1994) . ICAM-1 has five Ig domains (Fig. 1) , a transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic domain. Other members of the ICAM family are ICAM-2, ICAM-3, ICAM-4 and ICAM-5. All ICAMs show the same domain organization, sequence homology between domains, and are func- tionally and structurally related. ICAMs differ in the number of Ig domains, cell type, and expression regulation. ICAM-1 promotes intercellular signaling, mainly in processes derived from response to inflammation. It permits antigen-independent adhesion between lymphocytes and their targets, and has a major role in leukocyte transmigration from the blood to the tissues in inflammatory sites (van de Stolpe and van der Saag, 1996) . Two membrane-bound integrin receptors, leukocyte function-associated antigen (LFA-1), and macrophage-1 antigen (Mac-1) are the normal ligands for ICAM-1. Binding sites for these receptors have been identified by mutagenesis techniques and competition experiments in domains D1 and D3, respectively ( Fig. 1) . ICAM-1 also serves as a receptor for soluble fibrinogen, its binding site still controversial, as well as for the extracellular matrix factor hyaluronan (van de Stolpe and van der Saag, 1996) . These interactions probably mediate leukocyte adhesion to vascular endothelium. The cytoplasmic domain of ICAM-1 interacts with the cytoskeleton-binding protein oL-actinin (Carp6n et al., 1992) , determining cell surface distribution of ICAM-1 and recruitment to points of interaction with other cells.",

As expected, each domain adopts an Ig fold. Binding sites on domain D1 can be mapped on the crystal structure (Fig. 2) . Residues identified by mutational analysis as important for HRV binding belong to the three loops DE, BC, and FG, located at the very tip of domain D1. The interaction between ICAM-1 and LFA-1 probably requires a broad surface centered around Glu34, a residue crucial for binding located in strand C. By analogy, domain D1 could be described as a hand with three stretched fingers and a folded thumb. The tips of the three fingers (loops DE, BC, and FG) would be responsible for recognition and binding to the major group of rhinoviruses, whereas the folded thumb would be the LFA-1 recognition site. Residues important for binding ICAM-1 to malarial-infected erythrocytes map to strand B and loop CD, defining another interacting surface that differs in location from both rhinovirus and LFA-1 binding sites.",

The presence of an antiviral compound in the pocket would impart rigidity to the hinge region and prevent the second step to occur. As a consequence uncoating would be inhibited. Conversely, empty pockets would impart conformational flexibility to the hinge region, and ultimately allow movement of polypeptide chains during the uncoating process. Crystal structures of HRVs show uncharacterized pocket molecules, probably lipidic in nature, filling the hydrophobic pocket in a manner similar to the antiviral compounds in HRV14 (Smith et al., 1986; Kim et al., 1989; Oliveira et al., 1993) . It has been suggested that pocket-binding antiviral drugs displace such \"pocket factors\", and that competition between pocket factors and receptors regulates the viral stability (Rossmann, 1994) . For example, ICAM-1 would be able to eject a weakly bound pocket molecule during the second step of the mechanism shown in Fig. 5 , thus emptying the hydropho-",

A two-step mechanism for the binding of ICAM-1 to HRVs can reconcile these conflicting observations. In a first step, complexes between HRVs and ICAM-1 form in a reversible manner, as they can be observed in cryo-EM reconstructions. The second step involves a displacement Fig. 5 . Scheme of a two-step binding mechanism between ICAM-1 and major group HRVs. The first step, on the left, is observed in the cryo-EM reconstructions of HRV-ICAM-1 fragments. On the right, the second (hypothesized) step involves a conformational change in the virus surface. The five-fold channel may open as both walls and floor of the canyon bind to domain D1 of ICAM-1. The pocket region is postulated as the hinge area, and needs to be empty in order to provide conformational flexibility.",

            "text": "The study of the interaction between major group HRVs and their receptor, ICAM-1, suggests an hypothesis for how ICAM-1 might initiate uncoating of the viral RNA. Initial contact between the virus and receptor occurs mostly through capsid residues in the canyon and four loops at the tip of domain D1 of ICAM-1, at the end distal from the membrane. This interaction appears to have an important electrostatic component. High-affinity binding probably requires a second step in which other areas of the viral surface and the receptor may come into contact. This second step probably weakens the interactions between the capsid protomers and triggers the uncoating mechanism, perhaps through channels opened in the icosahedral fivefold axes. Capsid-binding antiviral compounds can effectively block the uncoating process by imparting rigidity to the viral capsid and preventing the high affinity binding step between ICAM-1 and HRVs. Many details need still to be addressed, and parallels sought with other picornavirus-receptor interactions. Lacking crystallographic resolution images of the virus-receptor complexes, cryo-EM reconstructions assisted with fitting of molecular models of the individual components will prove very valuable to demonstrate precisely how the virus and receptor interact, and to provide clues about the sequence of events that goes from initial cell surface attachment to release of the RNA into the host cell cytoplasm.",
