            "text": "Since the establishment of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) in 2004, there has been an institutional development including the revision of the Countermeasures against Natural Disasters Act (2005), which introduced significant natural disaster prevention policies, and the enactment of the Storm and Flood Insurance Act (2006), which strengthened the private function of voluntary disaster prevention measures. These institutional improvements were governmental activities to meet the increased needs for safety by the public. On the basis of institutional enhancement, the Park Geun-hye Administration, which began in 2013, recognized the importance of integrated disaster and safety management and proposed a goal to strengthen the government\u2019s function to protect the lives and safety of the public. To this end, the Ministry of Public Administration and Security was renamed as the Ministry of Security and Public Administration (MoSPA), and the role of coordinating every ministry\u2019s disaster and safety policies was authorized to MoSPA. In addition, the tasks dealing with human-caused disasters that NEMA had taken charge of were transferred to MoSPA in 2013. MoSPA revised the Framework Act of Disaster and Safety Management in order to integrate human-caused disaster and social disaster into social disaster in December 2013. Irrespective of these efforts, however, after the successive disasters of the Pangyo collapse accident and the Gyeongju Mauna Ocean Resort Gymnasium collapse accident, the commitment to public safety by the Park Geun-hye Administration was in crisis. It was the Sewol Ferry sinking accident on April 16, 2014, that strongly pushed the Park Geun-hye Administration to innovate the national DRM system.",

When the first report of the accident was received at 8:55 on April 16, the Korea Coast Guard started to operate a rescue center from 9:10 in accordance with the Framework Act of Disaster and Safety Management. At 9:40, the Central Disaster Management Headquarters (CDMHQ), directed by the minister of the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, was installed, and at 9:45, the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters (CDSCHQ), directed by the minister of MoSPA, was set up. However, as there was a communication failure among Rescue Headquarters, CDMHQ, and CDSCHQ, a counting error on the occupants and the rescued occurred. Therefore, a pan-governmental accident control tower, directed by the Prime Minister, was set up on April 17 in order to manage the catastrophic accident. Due to this accident, 295 people out of 476, including the crew and passengers, died and nine people remain missing. The pan-governmental accident control tower was closed on November 18, 2014.",

The government then reflected the President\u2019s statement on the restructuring of the system and submitted the revision of the Government Organization Act on June 11, 2014, to the National Assembly. This Act was approved at the General Assembly Meeting on November 7 and implemented on November 19, installing the Ministry of Public Safety and Security (MPSS) as a responsible ministry of national disaster and safety management under the Office of Prime Minister (OPM). MPSS\u2019s integrated tasks are safety management and social disaster management in the MoSPA; natural disaster management and firefighting in NEMA; and maritime security and prevention of coastal and marine pollution (except for the works on investigations and information of incidents at sea) in Korea Coast Guard.

The establishment of NEMA in 2004 was meaningful as the first independent agency to deal with natural disaster management, human-caused disaster management, civil defense, firefighting, and emergency rescue on land. However, as a vice-minister level, it had limited power and authorities to coordinate and control all line ministries. As an ad hoc solution, the Minister of the Ministry of Interior (MoI) took charge of directing the CDSCHQ, and the director of the NEMA took charge as deputy head, which made it hard for NEMA to coordinate and control disaster countermeasures among the line ministries, using its own discretion. In addition, with a revision of the Disasters and Safety Act in 2013, MoSPA took the responsibility of human-caused disaster management from NEMA, and after then, NEMA took charge of only natural disaster management and fire services, which made integrated disaster management weak. Therefore, the foundation of MPSS has implications in developing an integrated disaster and safety management system to deal with all types of disasters, which could solve problems rooted in 2013 and 2014.",

In other words, the balance of the national disaster and safety management system could be maintained by establishing a ministry which could manage and coordinate the disaster and safety management policies, which were meted out to each ministry. MPSS developed the Safety Innovation Master Plan (SIMP), which includes all the areas relevant to public safety, by reexamining the overall disaster safety management system in order to prepare the fundamental safety innovation plan. The SIMP, which contains every ministry plan, prepared the standardized framework of disaster safety management and put the realization of safety autonomy forward by supporting safety management by local governments comprehensively. Also, they strengthened safety welfare regarding disaster vulnerable groups like children and women and focused on the settlement of autonomous safety management through national participation.",

            "text": "In accordance with the Master Plan, MPSS has been improving the national disaster and safety management system with the following policies:First, MPSS constructed an integrated disaster management system to reinforce the control function and clarified roles and responsibilities of each Headquarters: CDSCHQ, CDMHQ, Local Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters (LDSCHQ), and Local Disaster Management Headquarters (LDMHQ). It also innovated a disaster response system: i.e., disaster response manuals were enhanced from complicated and paper-centered into simplified and action-oriented.Second, MPSS has reinforced on-site response capabilities in order to secure the golden time, 30 min on land and 1 h at sea, and strengthened the disaster management capabilities of the local government, which is the priority at the disaster scene. To secure the golden time, MPSS divided the land into four areas with independent 119 Special Rescue Teams in each area and divided the sea into five areas, covered by three Special Marine Rescue Teams, along with a prompt call out system. For strengthening the disaster management capabilities of local governments, MPSS supported local governments to strengthen their official\u2019s disaster management capabilities through providing education and training opportunities and to set up an exclusively professional disaster and safety management office. It also developed the Local Safety Index to induce local governments to check safety levels by themselves objectively, and to implement improvement measures for the disaster vulnerable parts autonomously. Moreover, MPSS enhanced disaster preparedness training by putting stress on the organizational capacity for on-site response. Accordingly, the 2016 Safe Korea Exercise was designed for strengthening the interconnectivity and cooperation among the CDSCHQ, the CDMHQ, and the LDMHQ to prepare for large-scale disasters and catastrophic events. Also, emergency rescue capabilities of the first responders were also tested and improved through drills.Third, strengthening public safety education, establishing public-private cooperation governance involving communities, and strengthening safety welfare for disaster vulnerable groups have been implemented in order to settle down the safety culture in daily life. To build up the capability to prepare for disaster autonomously, lifetime safety education is implemented as to provide safety education, which is tailored to their age and environment. To establish local governance, a website and a mobile application, coined \u201cSafe People,\u201d were developed and are being operated to involve residents in pre-examining the accident factors, and good examples from \u201cSafe People\u201d are promoted online and offline. For citizen\u2019s proactive participation in \u201cSafe People,\u201d MPSS run On-site Safety Report Joint Campaigns where they visit the education organizations and event sites, and support the promotion of National Safety Inspection. Also, they are expanding supporting projects for disaster vulnerable groups like the disabled, senior citizens, and children. In particular, they put efforts to make a safe environment for children at the level of developed countries.Fourth, MPSS has developed a prompt situation management and dissemination system, with a real-time link of disaster sites with national disaster situation rooms. To this end, MPSS established a real-time on-site monitoring system by installing a GIS-based disaster situation board, and strengthened the management of disaster vulnerable areas. In addition, MPSS developed a long-term plan to establish a disaster safety communication network to reinforce first response capabilities, an integrated response system, and an on-site commanding system. In 2016, the pilot projects started in three areas (Pyeongchang-gun, Gangneung-si, and Jeongseon-gun) in Gangwon-do, and the system will be installed nation-wide within a few years.Fifth, MPSS is promoting creative disaster and safety management policies in each ministry in order to develop appropriate countermeasures against special disasters, such as aviation influenza, marine accident, energy infrastructure accidents, hazardous materials, communications infrastructure failure, and nuclear power plant accidents, which need a different approach from traditional disaster management method. It also prepares for newly emerging risks like climate change (CC), aging, and globalization. Therefore, they put efforts on improving safety policies by identifying social issues and the needs of the public based on big data, by providing pre-emptive public service, and by establishing on-site disaster and accident symptom monitoring systems by utilizing intelligent Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) and Internet of Things (IoT). Also, they are enhancing the resident securing system to correspond to various security threats, managing nuclear safety, and strengthening the food and drug safety net with relevant ministries.\n",

Priority 1 is understanding disaster risk. DRM should be based on an understanding of disaster risk in all its dimensions of vulnerability, capacity, exposure of persons and assets, hazard characteristics, and the environment. Priority 2 is strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk. Disaster risk governance at the national, regional, and global levels is very important, and this should be ensuring the consistency with domestic laws, regulations and policies of national and local framework. Priority 3 is investing in DRR for resilience. Public and private investment in disaster risk prevention and reduction through structural and non-structural measures are essential to enhance the economic, social, health, and cultural resilience of persons, communities, countries, and their assets, as well as the environment. Priority 4 is enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response and to \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d in recovery, rehabilitation, and reconstruction. Having experience is to strengthen disaster preparedness and to have effective recovery. In their approach to DRR, States, regional, and international organizations and other relevant stakeholders should take into consideration the key activities listed under each of these four priorities and should implement them, as appropriate, taking into consideration respective capacities and capabilities, in line with national laws and regulations. In the context of increasing global interdependence and concerted international cooperation, developing the knowledge sharing, capacities and motivation for DRR are needed. The SFDRR is guided by following 13 principlesPrimary responsibility of States to prevent and reduce disaster risk, including through cooperation.Shared responsibility between central government and national authorities, sectors and stakeholders as appropriate to national circumstances.Protection of persons and their assets while promoting and protecting all human rights including the right to development.Engagement from all of society.Full engagement of all State institutions of an executive and legislative nature at national and local levels.Empowerment of local authorities and communities through resources, incentives, and decision-making responsibilities as appropriate.Decision-making to be inclusive and risk-informed while using a multi-hazard approach.Coherence of disaster risk reduction and sustainable development policies, plans, practices, and mechanisms, across different sectors.Accounting of local and specific characteristics of disaster risks when determining measures to reduce risk.Addressing underlying risk factors cost-effectively through investment versus relying primarily on post-disaster response and recovery.\u201cBuild Back Better\u201d for preventing the creation of, and reducing existing, disaster risk.The quality of global partnership and international cooperation to be effective, meaningful, and strong.Support from developed countries and partners to developing countries to be tailored according to needs and priorities as identified by them.\n",

These events, which used to be considered as extreme phenomena due to their \u201clow frequency,\u201d can no longer be ignored as they have become less extreme and more reoccurring. Perrow\u2019s Normal Accident Theory, Beck\u2019s Risk Society Theory, and the Power-law Distribution of Complexity Theory show that massive catastrophes can happen at any time. Through the analysis of disasters that have led to a change in disaster response policy, we were able to find that most of them, which can be labeled as \u201cfocusing event,\u201d have a common characteristic of \u201clow frequency and high impact.\u201d The events, such as the Seongsu Bridge collapse in 1994, the Sampoong Department Store collapse in 1995, Typhoon Rusa in 2002, the Daegu Subway Fire in 2003, the Sewol Ferry sinking accident in 2014, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2015, are typical examples of focusing events that are located in the long-tail of the Power-law Distribution and that have \u201clow frequency and high social impact.\u201d Therefore, a future disaster response system should be developed to thoroughly prepare for the disasters that are located in or have possibilities of being located in the long-tail of Power-law Distribution, based on the condition that such disasters can occur at any time. To this end, on the first hand, those responsible for safety at high-risk facilities should reduce the probability of disaster by thoroughly performing safety checks and diagnostics. The next step is to strengthen the initial response capacity so that even though an accident occurs, it does not evolve a national emergency. Rapid identification of risky situations, prompt reporting, and appropriate action by first responding agencies are essential capacities for this purpose. Finally, it is necessary to develop a \u201cnational catastrophic scenario\u201d in preparation for a national emergency that can occur with very little probability, and to establish a system in which all related stakeholders form a collaborative network for an efficient response.",

As of March 3, 2017, among the 32 types of disaster regulated by the Crisis Management Standard Manual, MPSS is primarily responsible for 6 types of disasters, and other ministries, such as the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, and the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, are handling 26 types of disasters. In other words, disaster prevention and response responsibilities in various areas, such as facility safety, industrial safety, and marine safety, are assigned to relevant ministries in accordance with individual laws and regulations. The problem is that these ministries are also in charge of industrial promotion in the same areas. While industry promotion aims to generate economic profit according to the market principle, disaster and safety management aims to securing safety through regulation in the area of high market failure, which will cause a lot of contradictions between industry promotion and disaster and safety management.6 Therefore, the Korean government should consider the transfer of the disaster and safety management duties of the industry promotion ministries to the disaster management coordination ministries, such as MPSS, or to establish a measure to ensure independence and transparency of disaster and safety management duties. Again, a check and balance system must be urgently secured based on the third-party inspection principle. At the same time, the important thing is to train professional officials who can implement the check and balance system. Actually, there are a few Korean universities or colleges that have a specialized program in DRM. Engineering departments dealing with floods, earthquakes, and facility collapses; firefighting departments dealing with fire and rescue service; and business management dealing with process management are covering their own areas in DRM; however, interdisciplinary study on DRM is still in its early stages.

In order to improve disaster resilience, it is essential to have a sound tool to closely investigate the capabilities required by the whole country in all phases of prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery, and Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (THIRA) in the USA and National Risk Assessment (NRA) in the UK are typical examples of such a tool.
