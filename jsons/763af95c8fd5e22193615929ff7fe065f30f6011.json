Among NPIs, measures to diminish contactable susceptible (Sc), such as staying home, travel constraint etc. and measures to avoid delay of diagnosis and hospitalized isolation (\u03b7) were more effective than EPS-based quarantine (\u03ba,\u03c1 or surveyQ). Upon the fitted models, the proportion of asymptomatic infectors was determined to be 14.88% (IQR 8.17%, 25.37%). The median incubation period and communicable period of COVID-19 under NPIs were 4.16 (IQR 3.60, 4.71) and 6.77 (IQR 4.53, 10.36) days respectively, and the median time from exposed to being contagious was 2.39 (IQR 2.26, 2.56) days.

World Health Organization (WHO) has designated this novel coronavirus as SARS-COV-2 1, 2 and declared it as a pandemic on March 11, 2020 3 China in February 2020, integrated social interventions including lockdown of high epidemic areas, physical and social distancing, quarantine, and isolation were undertaken to prevent the COVID-19 spreading 4 . The effectiveness of NPIs has been proved in some infectious diseases, like influenza [5] [6] [7] and SARS 8 . The NPIs are vitally important especially for COVID-19, because of the so fast spreading and the subsequent insufficiency of health-care resources leading to high mortality 9 . Besides the announcement of keeping physical and social distance to the public, epidemiological survey (EPS) -based quarantine and hospitalized isolation were widely implemented in all the provinces of Mainland China after the lockdown of Hubei province on the Jan 23, 2020 in emergency. Almost all the provinces were in semi-closure and executed with community closed management, meanwhile multiple provincial EPS groups were established to notify the close contacts to be in quarantine at home or indicated shelters. And for the suspected and diagnosed COVID-19 patients, early detection, early reporting, early isolation and early treatment were adopted according to the Chinese Clinical Guidance for COVID-19 Pneumonia Diagnoses and Treatment version 6 10 .",

To mimic the early spreading and early social intervention, we established a novel epidemic model, named ScEIQRsh (contactable Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Quarantined-Removed) model to depict COVID-19 spreading in China. The classical SIR or SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed) epidemic model assumes that infectors mix up with all the susceptible per day, whereas ScEIQRsh model assumes that infectors mix up with the contactable susceptible per day. The contactable susceptible indicates the family members, relatives, coworkers, friends and some contactable strangers of the infectors. Several studies assessed one single aspect of NPIs, such as travel restriction 13, 14 , airport screening 15, 16 , social distance 17 , and contact tracing 18 by classical SEIR based model without consideration of the other NPIs' influence on the transmission property of COVID-19. We aim to estimate the effectiveness of integrated NPIs to simulate COVID-19 restricted spreading in the 31 provinces of Mainland China.",

Sc represents the contactable susceptible under the social NPIs, such as keeping physical and social distance, cancelling gatherings, closing public places, which is set as a random variable in the model. Q reflects the EPS-based quarantine, and Rh reflects the isolation of confirmed and hospitalized infectors. E, I, and Rs compartments were outside of the intervention.

After emergency response, multiply provincial EPS group were established to investigate the contact history of each confirmed infectors and notified the close contacts to be in self-quarantine at home or in shelters. EPS can easily find close contacts of acquaintances, but be inefficient in finding transmission among strangers in public space.

As the daily air temperature increased from below 0\u2103 (32\u2109), the value of \u03b2 raised gradually until the air temperature went up to a peak of 7\u2103(44.6\u2109) in daily minimum temperature, or 10\u2103 (50\u2109) in daily mean temperature or 15\u2103 (59\u2109) in daily maximum, temperature respectively ( figure 6C-6E) , and then declined sharply as the temperature continued to raise. We observed transmission rate \u03b2 was higher than 11 in the range of 5\u2103-14\u2103 (41\u2109-57.2\u2109) mean air temperature, which may be most suitable for COVID-19 spreading. .

Assessment of NPI measures mitigating the spreading of COVID-19 and suppositional simulation Three independent parameters, contact rate (c), surveyQ and \u03b7, were crucial for stopping the spreading chain and evaluated separately for NPIs effectiveness. Based on our model, the median Sc was estimated as 26.98 (IQR:13.97, 54.57) with the highest in Hubei and lowest in Neimenggu province (supplementary table 1). The median c for 29 provinces was accordingly 6.84E-07 (IQR 3.77E-07, 1.44E-06) (figure 4A). The \u03ba and \u03c1 can be used to assess EPS effectiveness, and the median \u03ba of 29 provinces was 42.0 (IQR 27.83, 60.78), suggesting that 42 close contacts of one infector had been excavated averagely by EPS (figure S2A). The COVID-19 positive rate (\u03c1) in quarantined close contacts was speculated as 0.98% (IQR 0.47%-1.60%), ranged from 0.03%-5.10% (figure S2B), which was quite close to the WHO-China joint report of 0.9%-5% in China 12 . SurveyQ, the product of \u03ba times \u03c1, was 0.39 (IQR 0.22, 0.55), which indicated that 0.39 positive cases were found in EPS-based close contacts averagely for each confirmed infector (figure 4C).

Discussion After first-level public health emergency response on the Jan 23, 2020, integrated NPIs in Mainland China during the epidemic of COVID-19 are as follows 4 : 1) lockdown of high epidemic areas including Wuhan; 2) extension of the Chinese Spring Festival to the Feb 2, 2020; 3) interand intro-province travel restraint; 4) closing public places, avoiding gatherings and staying at home; 5) environmental disinfection and personal protective measures including wearing masks; 6) physical and social distancing measures; 7) setting up provincial epidemiological survey groups and close contact tracing for each confirmed case or imported infector; 8) notification of close contacts to be in quarantine for 14 days at home or shelters; 9) identification of suspected COVID-19 in Cough and Fever Clinics; 10) hospitalized isolation for every confirmed case; 11) preventing healthcare-associated infections. Among them, 1-6 diminished Sc or c, 7-8 contributed to \u03ba and \u03c1, 9-11 contributed to \u03b7 in the ScEIQRsh model. The classical SEIR based NPI model usually have to be staged to simulate the propagating stage and NPI stage separately, instead, ScEIQRsh model can well fit the realistic provincial epidemic and NPI data of COVID-19 in China entirely without halfway adjustment of the parameters. The assumption of ScEIQRsh model makes it a model to depict intra-acquaintance spreading pattern, and if Sc were replaced with all the susceptible, it could degenerate into classical SEIR model. A report of the \"WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19 \" claimed that humanto-human transmission of COVID-19 largely occurred intra-family in China 12 . In Guangdong and Sichuan province, about 78%-85% of clustered infections were within families 12 . And in Beijing, there are 176 clustered cases among 262 confirmed cases and 133 (50.8%) were clustered intrafamily cases 11 . The implementation of effective social NPIs in Mainland China changed the spreading pattern of COVID-19 into intra-acquaintance spreading, in which acquaintance refers to the family members, relatives, friends and co-workers, as well as some contactable strangers for obtaining daily necessities. That's the reason why ScEIQRsh model can perfectly fit both epidemic and NPI data of COVID-19 in China. Even the median transmission rate of COVID-19 among acquaintances was high as 10.22 (IQR 8.47, 12.35), the Rvq was still less than one, which implied",

The calculated median incubation period of COVID-19 was 4.16 days (IQR 3.60, 4.71), which was close to the reported 3 days in a study of including 1,099 laboratory-confirmed cases by Zhong N.S et al 25 and 5.1 days in 181 confirmed cases of COVID-19 by Lessler Justin et al 26 . The median communicable period (1/\u03b3) of asymptomatic infectors was computed as 6.77 days (IQR 4.53, 10.36), which was near the 9.6 days in 24 asymptomatic infectors reported by Shen H.B et.al 27 . Previous studies about meteorological impact on the SARS-COV-2 transmissibility were still controversial. Wang Mao et al 19 and Sajadi MM et al 20 reported that regions in 30-50 o N' corridor with 5\u2103-11\u2103 average temperature had increased COVID-19 transmission, but Canelle Poirier et",

The optimal mean temperature ranges for COVID-19 transmission was 5\u2103-14\u2103 (41\u2109-57.2\u2109). Lowen Ac et.al proved that influenza virus transmission by droplets was greater and the peak duration of virus shedding lasted longer at 5\u2103 (41\u2109) than 20\u2103 (68\u2109) 29 . Indeed, we observed the \u03b2 of COVID-19 at 5\u2103 (7.39\u00b11.62) was higher than \u03b2 at 20.25\u2103 (4.39\u00b11.63). Another similar infectious disease, SARS was found with higher transmission in temperature<24.6\u2103 than >24.6\u2103 circumstance in Hong Kong 30 . It's hard to say if it will disappear in the coming summer or reappear in the nextyear, but from the curve we illustrated, we could suspect the transmission rate would further reduce at higher temperature over 20.25\u2103 (68.45 \u2109). The broader range of air temperature for optimal COVID-19 transmission strongly suggests the necessity and urgency of vaccine at present or in the future.In conclusion, we constructed the stochastic ScEIQRsh model which can well fit both the early spreading and early social intervention data of COVID-19 in China. The effectiveness of NPIs for mitigating the transmission of COVID-19 were evaluated, keeping the contactable susceptible (Sc or c) in low level and promoting the diagnosis and hospitalized isolation of COVID-19 promptly are crucial for mitigating early transmission of COVID-19. The properties of COVD-19, such as proportion of asymptomatic infectors, incubation period and communicable period were determined. The appropriate temperature for SARS-COV-2 transmission was within 5\u2103-14\u2103 (41\u2109-57.2\u2109). Our model might be useful for providing suggestions on managing and preventing COVID-19 transmission among acquaintances and some contactable strangers of the infectors, even suitable for other similar infectious disease.
