The SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been consistently associated with this disease.3 Although this virus seems to be necessary for the development of SARS, it has not been localised at the site of lung pathology.3, 4 Poutanen and colleagues5 found human metapneumovirus (HMPV) as a second pathogen in patients with SARS and postulated that HMPV potentiates the progression or severity of coronavirus infection.",

In the other cases, the post-mortem examination was limited to the lungs. We included only those patients for whom paired serum samples were submitted for virological studies during the course of the illness. Patients with only needle-biopsy samples of organs available were excluded.

This diffuse alveolar damage typically goes through an exudative phase followed by a proliferative phase,9 although others have described a three-stage process: an inflammatory or exudative phase, a proliferative phase, and a final fibrotic phase.10 Viral infections resulting in diffuse alveolar damage typically fall into two categories; influenza viruses A and B and adenovirus cause most cases of viral pneumonia in immunocompetent adults. Immunocompromised hosts are susceptible to pneumonias caused by cytomegalovirus and other herpesviruses, measles virus, and adenovirus.11 In addition to the diffuse alveolar damage here, morphological features of giant cells and pneumocyte hyperplasia, which appear to be prominent in this viral infection, were seen in these patients.4, 12 Multinucleate giant cells within the alveoli have previously been reported in patients with SARS,4, 12 but their derivation has remained unclear. We have documented that in three of the patients these giant cells are of macrophage origin and in one other patient they are epithelial in origin. These giant cells were not present in the ante-mortem lung biopsy sample and were present only in patients with disease progression for longer than 8 days from admission.

However, several features of fatal coronaviral pneumonia can be identified. Coronavirus infection in the early stages seems to stimulate epithelial cells and results in cellular proliferation and squamous metaplasia in the lung. This type-2 pneumocyte hyperplasia and hypertrophy has also been identified with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (an arterivirus tentatively classified under the Coronaviridae\n16) as well as porcine respiratory coronavirus (previously known as transmissible gastroenteritis virus, respiratory variant). In those infections mild type-2 pneumocyte proliferation is associated with squamous metaplasia.17 In SARS, macrophage proliferation is more prominent in the consolidated areas of the lung; this distribution is also seen with porcine respiratory coronavirus.18\n",

            "text": "In contrast to typical diffuse alveolar damage in which neutrophils and fibroblasts are the main cellular agents and macrophages have a lesser role,9 in patients with fatal SARS macrophages are the prominent leucocyte in the alveoli, even in the early stages of the disease. The finding of haemophagocytosis in the lung and white-pulp atrophy of the spleen identified in SARS is reminiscent of that reported in fatal influenza subtype H5N1 disease in 1997.19 Haemophagocytosis has been attributed to cytokine dysregulation.20 Lymphopenia is another feature common to both SARS-CoV and H5N1 influenza pneumonia.21 Both viruses have crossed to human beings from animals or birds.3, 21 Experimental studies in which macrophages are infected in vitro suggest that, compared with conventional human influenza viruses, the subtype H5N1 influenza A viruses isolated in 1997 are hyperinducers of proinflammatory cytokines.22 Human coronavirus OC43 can replicate in human macrophages in vitro.23 Taken together, the similarity of clinical and pathological changes in SARS-CoV pneumonia and H5N1 pneumonia suggest that proinflammatory cytokines released by stimulated macrophages in the alveoli have a prominent role in pathogenesis of SARS, resulting in cytokine dysregulation. This idea has implications for the management of coronaviral pneumonia. Intervention with steroids might modulate this cytokine response and prevent a fatal outcome, as has been proposed for nonviral acute respiratory distress syndrome.24\n",
