In cases of critical illness, patients progressed rapidly to acute respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, and septic shock. Early identification of risk factors for critical illness facilitated appropriate provision of supportive care and rapid access to the intensive care unit (ICU) when required. For patients with mild and moderate illness, general isolation treatment is required and ICU-care is not needed unless the condition worsens. Thus, early prognosis prediction would help reduce mortality and alleviate the shortage of medical resources.",

The diagnostic criteria are as follows: epidemiological history: within 14 days before the onset of COVID-19, there were travel history or residential history in Wuhan or surrounding areas, contact history of people with COVID-19, contact history of people with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan or surrounding areas, contact history of people with fever or respiratory symptoms from the community which was confirmed to have COVID-19 cases; clinical manifestations: fever and/or respiratory symptoms, imaging characteristics of pneumonia, leukocyte count was normal or decreased, or the lymphocyte count was decreased. Etiological evidence: real-time polymerase chain reaction test of respiratory or blood samples was positive for the nucleic acid of COVID-19, and the viral gene sequencing of respiratory or blood samples was highly homologous with the known COVID-19. Confirmed case: any one of the epidemiological history, any two of the clinical manifestations, and any one of the etiological evidence; if there is no clear epidemiological history, any three of the clinical manifestations, and any one of the etiological evidence. (2) complete baseline characteristics at the onset time. The exclusion criterion was primary infection by influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, SARS coronavirus, mycoplasma, chlamydia and bacteria. Clinical classification of COVID-19 pneumonia were done according to the new coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan (trial version 5) developed by the National Health Committee of the People\u2019s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/). The clinical classifications are as follows: (1) mild, slight clinical symptoms, no pneumonia manifestations on imaging. (2) moderate, with fever, respiratory tract symptoms, and imaging shows pneumonia. (3) severe, meet any of the following: (a) respiratory distress, respiratory rate \u2265 30 beats/min; (b) in the resting state, mean oxygen saturation \u2264 93%; (c) arterial blood oxygen partial pressure/oxygen concentration \u2264 300 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa).

LASSO regression is a type of machine learning regression, which was used to select independent risk factors that affect outcomes. The regression was generated using the glmnet package in R. Harrell\u2019s concordance index is routinely used to measure how well a variable or model predicts the time to a censored event. The index was generated using the rms package in R [8]. The calibration curve reflects the relationship between the prediction rate and the actual occurrence rate. The curve was also generated using the rms package in R. The abscissa is the prediction probability. The prediction model is used to predict the probability of the event, and 0 to 1 means the probability of the event is 0 to 100%. The ordinate is the actual probability (actual incident rate) of the patient. The red line is the fit line, which represents the actual value corresponding to the predicted value [9]. The decision curve is a useful tool to evaluate the clinical application of the model, which displays estimates of the standardized net benefit by the probability threshold used to categorize observations as \u2018high risk.\u2019 The clinical impact curve is an alternative plot for the output of the decision curve. Decision and clinical impact curves were generated using the DecisionCurve package in R [10].",

Age, NLR, and hypertension of the 61 individuals in the cohort were prognostic factors for critical illness incidence when the partial likelihood deviance was the smallest; NLR was the significant predictive factor when the lambda was 1 standard error (Fig. 2a, b). The three factors mentioned above were included in the multivariate COX regression analysis, and the results indicated that age and NLR are prognostic factors for critical illness of COVID-19 infection. However, when the hazard ratios (HR) of age was close to 1, age was transformed into a categorical variable (< 50 years/\u2265 50 years) based on cutoff value, and then the three variables were included in the COX regression analysis again.

The current difficulty is the shortage of medical resources, especially critical care resources. Early identification critical illness and risk stratification management will help alleviate insufficient medical resources and might reduce mortality. Recent studies have reported that low lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio [16], platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio [17], and thrombocytopenia [18] may be associated with critical illness. In addition, smoking and COPD have been associated with COVID-19 [19].

The decrease of lymphocyte count was related to the progress of the disease. It is unclear why lymphopenia is associated with severe illness. It has been hypothesized that COVID-19 may act on T lymphocytes, and T lymphocyte damage is an important factor that causes deterioration of the patient\u2019s condition [21]. In addition, a high leukocyte count is common in critically ill patients because damaged cells induce innate inflammation in the lungs, which is largely mediated by proinflammatory macrophages and granulocytes [22].

The independent risk factors affecting incidence of critical illness were screened. The results showed that NLR was the most important prognostic factor for progression, followed by age. Furthermore, according to the NLR and age stratification, the incidence of critical ill patients with NLR \u2265 3.13 and aged \u2265 50 years was 50%, and 9.1% in aged \u2265 50 years and NLR < 3.13 patients.",

The CURB-65 score was widely used to evaluate 30-day mortality of patients with community-acquired pneumonia [12\u201314]. In the study, NLR was compared with MuLBSTA and CURB-65 scoring models. The results showed that NLR had higher AUC, c-index, sensitivity and specificity, which indicated that NLR was better than the other two models for predicting the early incidence of COVID-19 critical illness. Furthermore, it was found that the prediction effects of the NLR-MuLBSTA and NLR-CURB-65 models were better than those of the original models. But NLR was an easy-to-use predictor index.",

Patients aged \u2265 50 and having an NLR < 3.13 have a moderate chance of developing a critical illness, and admitting to isolation ward with respiratory monitoring and supportive care was needed for these patients; patients aged \u2265 50 and having an NLR \u2265 3.13 have a high risk of developing a critical illness and need to be prepared for transfer to ICU for invasive respiratory support equipment (Fig. 7).

However, after we published our present study at medRxiv (https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.02.10.20021584v1) on February 12, 2020, another group draw similar conclusion by a meta-analysis with 828 patients [16]. The status of patients in the derivation and validation cohorts may be different, leading to an imbalance in some laboratory indicators, such as white blood cell count, neutrophil count, and lymphocyte count. CRP [29], cardiovascular disease [30] and COPD [19] were not associated with COVID-19 in this study. These may be due to the low number of subjects. Future multicenter studies with large sample sizes are needed to explore the applicability of the risk stratification of NLR according to age in predicting the critical illness of COVID-19. Second, most of patients are still in hospital, whose condition maybe change in follow-up, and the study has not included the final survival outcome of patients. However, we focused on the early identification of critical cases for risk stratification and management. We expect that the risk model can help alleviate the shortage of medical resources and manage the patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.",
