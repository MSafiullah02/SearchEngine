Review of systems was positive for dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, reduced oral intake for two days, and negative for fevers or chills at home. He had a sick contact at home. Vital signs on presentation were fever of 101, tachycardia with heart rate(HR) of 102, hypoxemia with saturating 85% on 100% non-rebreather. The patient was intubated in the ED for hypoxic respiratory failure. A computed tomography (CT) of the head was performed for altered mental status which demonstrated loss of gray-white differentiation at the left occipital and parietal lobes, consistent with acute infarct (figure 1a\n). CT of the chest demonstrated bilateral peripheral patchy airspace opacities and diffuse ground-glass opacities, characteristic for atypical pneumonia/viral infection from COVID-19 (Figure 1b\n). Electrocardiogram (EKG) was within normal limits. Blood work was significant for leukocytosis with lymphopenia. Urine analysis was within normal limits. C-reactive protein was elevated to 26mg/dl (0-0.4mg/dl). D-Dimer was not checked during the hospital course. COVID-19 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected the virus. Blood and urine cultures did not yield any growth. A repeat CT of the head demonstrated progressive large acute infarct of the left MCA territory with hyperdense appearance of left MCA vessels consistent with acute thrombus. The patient was deemed not a candidate for thrombolysis or neuro-intervention due to poor functional status. The patient was treated with aspirin and other supportive measures. No abnormal heart rhythm was noted on telemetry monitoring. The family eventually chose for comfort measures and terminally extubated the patient.",

Initial vital signs were significant for temperature of 101.4, HR of 94, blood pressure (BP) of 172/64, saturating 94% on room air. The examination was significant for left facial droop and slurred speech with no other significant neurological deficits. National Institute of health stroke scale(NIHSS) was calculated to be 2. Blood work was significant for leucopenia with lymphopenia. Urine analysis was within normal limits, chest X-Ray showed bilateral peripheral opacities. CT head was negative for any acute changes. CTA of head and neck demonstrated no large vessel occlusion, focal moderate stenosis of right MCA (Figure 2a\n), and incidental pulmonary ground-glass opacities in bilateral apices. COVID-19 was suspected given the fevers and CT findings. COVID-19 PCR detected the virus. D-DImer and other inflammatory markers were not checked. CXR progressively worsened with bilateral infiltrates (Figure 2b\n). Urine and blood cultures did not yield any growth. No arrhythmias were noted during the hospitalization. On day-3 of hospitalization, the patient developed left-sided hemineglect, worsening left-sided facial droop with left hemiparesis. The speech was normal. NIHSS was calculated to be 16. Repeat CT of the head demonstrated a new moderate hypodensity in the right frontal lobe representing acute infarct (Figure 2c\n). The patient was deemed too high risk for thrombolysis or neuro-intervention. A CT angiogram was planned prior to starting Integrellin but her respiratory status worsened requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Soon after, the family decided to withdraw care.",

Vital signs in ED were significant for Temp of 100.2, HR 101, BP 130/77, Examination was significant for left hemiplegic and aphasia. NIHSS was calculated to be 36.

The patient was deemed not a suitable candidate for any acute neuro-intervention due to large core infarct. Considering characteristic CT findings the patient was tested for COVID-19 PCR which detected the virus.

Recent bacterial or viral infections have been known to cause strokes by increasing cardioembolism as well as arterio-arterial embolism.[15] A recent study from the Netherlands by Klock et al. demonstrated that 31% of critically ill ICU patients develop thrombotic complications.[16] Another study looking at activated partial thromboplastin time-based clot waveform analysis(CWA) in COVID-19 patients concluded that CWA parameters demonstrate hypercoagulability that precedes or coincides with severe illness.[17] Multiple reports of pulmonary embolism are currently available in the literature.[18] Autopsy and pathology findings are scarcely available, but recent autopsy findings suggest thrombotic microangiopathy in multiple organs especially in the lungs.[19], [20], [21] No autopsy reports of the brain are available at the time of this writing. With this evidence, the most plausible mechanism of early cerebrovascular accidents could be hypercoagulability leading to macro and micro thrombi formation in the vessels. Other pathophysiology could be directly related to the infection or hypoxia. Further studies are urgently needed for comprehensive understanding neurological pathology of COVID-19 and its effects on the nervous system.",
