LUS is a point-of-care, easy-to-learn, radiation-free, bedside, quick and repeatable technique. LUS signs vary little by age,2 which makes it especially suitable for use in the smallest patients and in the critical care setting. In the past 10 years, there has been a notable increment in publications on the use of LUS in neonatology (Fig. 1), and even more in adult medicine. We demonstrated that launching a LUS program in their neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) roughly halved the number of chest radiograms and significantly decreased the mean radiation dose/patient.3 We present a comprehensive review on LUS in neonatology with an emphasis on pathophysiology and on a classification into descriptive (qualitative) and functional (semi-quantitative) applications.",

A sharp increase in echogenicity was described in the lower lung fields of TTN neonates and the authors named this finding \u2018double lung\u2019 point.10 Subsequent publications showed that the double lung point is not a perfect diagnostic tool for TTN, whose ultrasound appearance may include pleural line thickness, a more diffused alveolar\u2013interstitial pattern and the presence of normally aerated areas.11,12 This seems to be confirmed by the preliminary data of an ongoing multicentre, international study.13 Despite the rich semiology and the absence of a unique diagnostic sign, the distinction between TTN and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is relatively easy (see below), but it should be kept in mind that clinical and laboratory data must always be integrated with LUS to refine the diagnosis.14",

If the lung injury is severe enough, patients may qualify for RSV-induced ARDS and this is characterised by a shift towards a mainly restrictive and severe respiratory failure48 with a greater loss of aeration, as described above. LUS findings correlate with disease severity, with a higher proportion of hospitalised patients having positive findings compared to outpatients.49 Moreover, findings gradually resolve with clinical improvement and the lung aeration correlates with the duration of oxygen therapy both in spontaneously breathing infants50 and in those needing noninvasive respiratory support.47 A good concordance among operators of different expertise has been reported for the ultrasound evaluation of bronchiolitis,49 similar to that reported for restrictive disorders.18",

Since LUS detects the artefacts generated by the accumulation of fluid, and given that artefacts may be ranked according to the air/fluid ratio, it is possible to create scores inversely reflecting lung aeration. Several semi-quantitative scores are available in adult critical care and their description is beyond our scope. Nonetheless, all LUS scores are based on the same semiology and, interestingly, they seem only useful in restrictive lung disorders. In fact, an obstructive condition will create air-trapping and this might not be distinguishable from a normally aerated lung at LUS, as both present with A-lines. Consistently, LUS scores may well evaluate lung aeration, but they cannot detect over-distension, as it has been proven in ventilated adults.68 Despite these limitations, LUS scores offer the advantage of allowing serial semi-quantitative evaluations of the disease severity.",

We were able to demonstrate that the LUS score is suitable and inversely correlated to oxygenation.70 The score is based on three chest areas for each side (upper anterior, lower anterior and lateral) and a 0-to-3 score is given for each area: more details are shown in supplementary material S6. The LUS score is able to predict the need for surfactant treatment in preterm infants below 34 weeks\u2019 gestation (area under the curve: 0.93 (95% CI: 0.86\u20130.99; p < 0.001)),70 and in extremely preterm neonates affected by RDS (area under the curve: 0.94 (95% CI: 0.90\u20130.98; p < 0.001)).71 The diagnostic accuracy was lower in late preterm and term neonates since they may be affected by various lung disorders with different appearance and severity, such as RDS and TTN, but also aspiration syndromes and sepsis or ARDS.

In the meantime, available data demonstrate that a visually calculated LUS score is a useful and easy tool to predict surfactant need in preterm neonates with RDS, to evaluate lung aeration while titrating the respiratory support or to be used as a research outcome measure.75 LUS score has its drawbacks (i.e. a semi-quantitative measure, impossibility to detect air-trapping) but is more easy and quickly available at the bedside than more complex techniques, such as electrical impedance tomography or respiratory inductance plethysmography.76,77",

Formal LUS protocols for the evaluation of trauma,80 dyspnoea81 and shock,82 are commonly used in adult critical care. Thus, LUS needs to be integrated into appropriate decision-making algorithms in neonatology. Point-of-care ultrasound is rapidly growing and guidelines about neonatologist-performed echocardiography have been already published,83,84 but there are no formal algorithms for the use of LUS in neonatology. A project in this direction has been specifically funded by a European Society for Paediatric Research grant and aimed to create the \u2018SAFE protocol\u2019 (Sonographic Algorithm for liFe threatening Emergencies) to standardise the use of LUS in critically ill neonates. The SAFE protocol is designed for use in the case of unexpected and severe decompensation (bradycardia or severe desaturation requiring resuscitative manoeuvres or significantly increasing oxygen/ventilator parameters to maintain stable oxygen saturation levels) in formerly stable infants in the NICU. It aims to help the diagnosis of the most urgent treatable complications: current knowledge on the ultrasound detection of the most critical neonatal complications was integrated into the algorithm and rapid diagnosis of unexpected and potentially fatal complications was prioritised. The SAFE protocol starts with an easy, subjective \u2018eyeball\u2019 assessment of myocardial contractility, which is comparable to other techniques which are more accurate but unsuitable during emergencies.85,86 Then, SAFE uses standardised items together with a simplified and rapid rule-in/rule-out approach to detect only three main life-threatening complications. As shown in Fig. 3, the ultrasound algorithm is designed by order of urgency. Hence, ruling out cardiac tamponade, which is a rare condition, is the first step in the decision tree since it may be rapidly fatal in the absence of prompt intervention followed by pneumothorax, and lastly, pleural effusion. The latter is also quite unusual, but it is associated to central venous lines often used in NICU care: current guidelines for adult critical care recommend the use of LUS for the diagnosis of pleural effusion, as it outperforms chest X-rays.4 SAFE is designed for the average neonatologist, it requires only minimal training and can be performed with a single ultrasound probe, as it targets basic ultrasound signs. A preliminary evaluation of SAFE after basic training in an academic NICU has shown that the algorithm is quick and easy to perform, even for lesser-experienced clinicians.87 The SAFE protocol will need to be evaluated prospectively, as it has been done for similar algorithms (Bedside Lung Ultrasound in Emergency (BLUE) and Fluid Administration Limited by Lung Sonography (FALLS)) presently used in adult critical care.80\u201382 Moreover, although any probe can be used, the optimal probe needs to be determined with a specific study. Further work to expand the SAFE protocol to include other organs is ongoing.",

LUS guidance is recommended for chest tube placement in adults,88 as this effectively reduces complications.89 There are no neonatal studies about these procedures, but it is highly probable that LUS may provide similar advantages, also because of the smaller patients\u2019 size. We demonstrated that the LUS detection of tension PNX is extremely accurate and quicker than using conventional radiology.36 Other authors successfully performed a LUS-guided drainage of a life-threatening tension pneumomediastinum.90 Even in the absence of specific studies, the use of LUS is advisable in these situations, where enough expertise exists, as LUS will likely assist the operator and make the procedure easier.",

This can be achieved by assessing the normal sliding on both hemithoraces that confirms ventilation; in turn, other studies have aimed to directly visualise the ETT tip position. Jaeel et al. recently performed a systematic review of neonatal studies on this topic.91 The studies report a successful visualisation of the tube tip in more than 80% of cases and this correlated with the position observed on chest radiograms in 73\u2013100% of cases. We must acknowledge that there were variations in techniques, calculations, probes and operators\u2019 expertise across the studies: LUS visualisation of ETT does not seem to be straightforward and is potentially subjected to erroneous interpretation. Simpler techniques (such as digital palpation of the ETT tip in the suprasternal notch) have also been proposed. Unless convincing evidence is published, LUS cannot be recommended as a routine technique to verify ETT placement, while end-tidal CO2 measurement is recognised as the gold standard.92",

The algorithm only takes a few minutes and aims to help diagnosing the most urgent treatable complications whilst awaiting expert help.
