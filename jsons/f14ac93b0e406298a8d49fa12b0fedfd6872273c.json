            "text": "In many enveloped virus families, including HIV and HSV, a crucial, yet unexploited, step in the viral life cycle is releasing particles from the infected cell membranes. This release process is mediated by host ESCRT complex proteins, which is recruited by viral structural proteins and provides the mechanical means for membrane scission and subsequent viral budding. The prazole drug, tenatoprazole, was previously shown to bind to ESCRT complex member Tsg101 and quantitatively block the release of infectious HIV-1 from cells in culture. In this report we show that tenatoprazole and a related prazole drug, ilaprazole, effectively block infectious Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)-1/2 release from Vero cells in culture. By electron microscopy, we found that both prazole drugs block the release of HSV particles from the cell nuclear membrane resulting in their accumulation in the nucleus. Ilaprazole also quantitatively blocks the release of HIV-1 from 293T cells with an EC50 of 0.8 \u00b5M, which is more potent than tenatoprazole. Finally, we synthesized and tested multiple novel prazole-based analogs that demonstrate both binding to Tsg101 and inhibition of viral egress in the nanomolar range of HIV-1 from 293T cells. Our results indicate that prazole-based compounds may represent a class of drugs with potential to be broad-spectrum antiviral agents against multiple enveloped viruses, by interrupting cellular Tsg101 interaction with maturing virus, thus blocking the budding process that releases particles from the cell.",

Unfortunately, antivirals have not had the same success. There are many contributing factors to this shortcoming, foremost the fact that few mechanisms are shared by different viruses limits targets for a broad-spectrum antiviral. Consequently, approved antivirals generally act against individual rather than groups of viruses, limiting a single drug's potential. However, this may change with the finding that multiple classes of enveloped viruses share the same budding mechanism that relies on host-cell endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) proteins (1, 2) . An inhibitor of this pathway could represent a potential broad-spectrum antiviral and have a positive impact on our ability to treat multiple enveloped virus infections with a single therapeutic agent.",

Enveloped viruses do not encode the machinery needed for budding and must recruit host-cell proteins to bud from cells. In HIV, ESCRT proteins are recruited to virus budding complexes through an interaction between the L-domain (PTAPP motifs) in virus structural proteins (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) with cellular protein Tsg101 (Tumor susceptibility gene 101), a homolog of the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme and a member of the ESCRT-I complex (6, (8) (9) (10) (11) . Tsg101 recruits the cellular ESCRT-III complex, which provides the mechanical means for viruses to passage through cell membranes to be released (10, (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) . Another enveloped virus family member, herpes simplex virus, HSV, assembles particles in the nucleus and relies on ESCRT proteins for passage through the nuclear membrane (20) (21) (22) (23) .

This indicates that the human immune system evolved to target the ESCRT pathway to control infections and supports that this is a natural target. Another group identified single-nucleotide polymorphic sites in the 5' region of Tsg101, located at positions -183 and +181 relative to the translation start signal, which affect the rate of AIDS progression among Caucasians (27) . These data support the hypothesis that variation in Tsg101 affects efficiency of Tsg101-mediated release of viral particles from infected cells, altering plasma viral load levels and subsequent disease progression. Taken together, these investigations indicate that Tsg101 and ESCRT proteins present a natural antiviral target.",

PPIs form a covalent bond with the active site of proton pumps, inhibiting their ability to acidify the stomach and reducing symptoms associated with over-acidification (28) . Recent reports indicate that drugs from the prazole family, including tenatoprazole and esomeprazole, form a disulfide linkage to Tsg101, which results in blocking the release of HIV-1 from cells in culture (5) . Other groups recently reported that prazoles may have potential as an antiviral therapeutic in HSV and SARS-CoV2 in combination with acyclovir or remdesivir, respectively (29, 30) . However, the prazole compound used in these studies, omeprazole, was not potent enough to be predicted to have a therapeutic effect in vivo. This highlights a gap in the ability for current prazoles to have therapeutic potential, and the need for further research on prazoles as antivirals.",

To further define the mechanism of action of these prazole drugs on HSV infections, we identified the site of blockage of herpes virus release, which appears to be different from HIV-1. While the blockage to HIV-1 particle release is at the outer cell membrane (5), the prazole drugs appear to first block the passage of the herpes virus through the nuclear membrane. This prevents particles being released into the cytosol, where maturation of their envelope membrane occurs to produce infectious virus. With the prazole-based inhibitors being effective in both HIV and HSV, targeting Tsg101 could lead to a broadspectrum antiviral therapy.",

This truncated Tsg101, called Tsg101-UEV, was used because full-length Tsg101 has significant solubility issues in aqueous solution. Tsg101 is an adaptor protein and thus lacks a readily deployable functional assay, making FTS a tractable approach to identify interacting compounds. FTS monitors protein thermal denaturation using SYPRO\u00ae Orange, a dye which fluoresces when bound to hydrophobic surfaces, which allows monitoring of the changes in hydrophobic surface exposure during protein denaturation (31) . Since ligand binding affects protein thermal stability, it can be detected through modulation of protein thermal denaturation (melting) as a shift in melting temperature (Tm). Tsg101-UEV has a well-defined melting curve suitable for FTS.",

This specific binding is consistent with a previous NMR structure in which tenatoprazole forms a covalent disulfide bond to Cys73 in the UEV domain of the protein (5).

Ilaprazole's potency is a large improvement over tenatoprazole, which inhibited in the high \u00b5M range (Table 1 & 3) . Additionally, ilaprazole was even more effective in inhibiting virus release at 72 h as at 24 h after a single application of the drug (72 h EC50<1\u00b5M; compare Table 3 , columns 2 & 4). The inhibition caused by tenatoprazole against either virus began to fall off after 48 h (data not shown). We also tested for toxicity in the range of effective concentrations and did not observe cell toxicity using the 96\u00ae AQueous One Solution cell proliferation assay reagent and WST-1 reagent over a 24 h period ( Table 3 , right columns).

Without drug, we observe particles in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus (Fig 4A & C) , in the presence of drug little or no viral particles are found in the cytoplasm (Fig 4B & D) .

Initial testing of four analog compounds against HIV-1 reveal further increases in potency above that seen with ilaprazole (Table 4 ) with EC50 calculations ranging from 14-16 nM.

            "text": "In this work we demonstrate antiviral activity of prazole compounds, with no detectable cell toxicity at effective concentrations, against two viruses that use different mechanisms for viral replication. Of particular note is that the viral genomes are very different, with HIV being RNA-based and HSV being DNA-based. That one compound works against viruses with such stark difference in viral life cycle types supports that these compounds have potential as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent for current and emerging viruses. This aspect gives this approach advantage over other potential broad-spectrum antivirals, such as remdesivir, which is targeted to RNA viruses, limiting its potential as a broadspectrum antiviral (54) . Tsg101 binding to the proline-rich PTAPP viral L-domains in Gag (3, 6, 7, 11, 14, 15) is required for virus particles to be released from cell membranes of infected cells. Tsg101 is a member of the ESCRT-I complex of proteins involved in cell endosomal sorting. The ESCRT-I complex recruits proteins from the ESCRT-III complex with AIP1 (19) , which provides the mechanical means for scission of virus particles from cell membranes. Thus, blocking the PTAPP L-domain sequence from interacting with the host proteins causes the virus budding defect and several lines of independent evidence support this idea. First, drugs targeted to this specific interaction in HIV cause budding defects in cells without detectable off-target effects (5) . Second, a research group identified noncoding SNPs in the 5' region of Tsg101, which affect the degree of Tsg101-mediated release of viral particles (27) . Third, viral infections activate a host innate immunity mechanism, through Interferon Stimulated Gene 15 (ISG15), that specifically disrupts virus budding complexes (1) . In response to this immune system defense, many viruses encode enzymes that prevent or reverse ISG15 conjugation to cellular proteins to avoid the budding blockade (55) (56) (57) (58) (59) (60) .",

The drugs block the release of HIV-1 at the outer cell membrane by preventing pinching of virus particles from the membrane (5). In contrast, herpes viruses appear to be first blocked at the passage of the virus through the nuclear membrane. Because the prazole drugs form a covalent bond to Tsg101, it strongly suggests that the ESCRT proteins are important for the herpes virus particles to be released from the nucleus of the cell where they are formed. This is consistent with the recent report by Arii et al., (61) that the ESCRT-III protein complex mediates herpes virus movement across the nuclear membrane and regulates its integrity. The finding that the prazole drugs cause a significant drop in total infectious herpes viruses can be explained by the trapping of immature particles in the nucleus, which prevents them from migrating into the cytoplasm to exchange enveloped membranes, which makes them infectious. The accumulation of the dense material in the nucleus observed in the electron micrographs suggests that the drug may interfere with normal particle assembly in addition to blocking the release of the particles from the nuclear membrane.",

            "text": "The use of prazoles as an antiviral represents an exciting potential case of repurposing existing drugs to act as antiviral agents. Currently, omeprazole is marketed as a prodrug for treatment of acid reflux disease. The prodrugs are acid-activated into derivatives that form disulfide linkages with proton pumps (28, 62, 63) . The prodrug, but not the charged sulfonamide derivative, can cross the plasma membrane barrier. The antiviral activity of tenatoprazole has been suggested to be the result of forming a covalent disulfide bond with Tsg101 (5). While the binding site for tenatoprazole is near the ubiquitin (Ub) binding pocket and not the L-domain binding site, biochemical and confocal imaging data independently demonstrated that tenatoprazole disrupts the binding of Tsg101 to the PTAPP sequence (5) . While the precise biochemical mechanism remains to be clarified, our FTS results support that it may be related to allosteric changes in Tsg101 after the drug forms its covalent linkage with Cys73. One of our most potent lead compounds is another prazole drug, ilaprazole, which is also marketed for treatment of acid reflux disease in China, India, and South Korea (Yi Li An, Adiza, Noltec, respectively) indicating that it has reasonable bioavailability and a known clinical safety profile. Previous reports did not detect offtarget effects of the prazole drugs affecting Tsg101 metabolism inside of cells (5) . The prazoles we tested here also appear to be nontoxic to Vero, Hela, and 293T cells at the concentrations used to inhibit budding of herpes viruses and HIV-1.",

            "text": "A recent report highlighted the potential of prazole compounds to have a therapeutic effect on SARS-CoV-2 when combined with remdesivir (30) . However, the authors did not definitively identify the mechanism of action of the prazoles and also concluded that the potency of the prazole compound used, omeprazole, is too low to reach therapeutic levels in vivo. A potential mechanism posed by the authors is that the prazoles lead to an increase in lysosomal pH, which is the potential mechanism for lysosomotropic drugs such as chloroquine (64) . In contrast to omeprazole, we hypothesize that ilaprazole and our more potent novel prazole compounds may allow for therapeutic levels to be reached in vivo. In the case of ilaprazole, which is marketed in several Asian countries as discussed above, our strong in vitro results lay the foundation for a potential fast-track to broad-spectrum antiviral clinical testing, alone or in combination with other drugs, in these countries. We are currently working to determine if ilaprazole or our novel compounds have activity against SARS-CoV-2 with or in combination with remdesivir. This would further the potential broad-spectrum antiviral capacity of the prazole compounds described in this report. FTS using thermal shift elicited by the small molecule binding effect to protein stability. FTS monitors protein thermal denaturation using environment-sensitive dye Sypro\u00ae Orange which fluoresces when bound to hydrophobic surfaces, taking advantage of the changes in hydrophobic surface exposure in protein denaturation. Discovery of small molecule binding to target protein utilizes the observation that ligand binding affects protein thermal stability, and therefore can be detected through a shift in the protein's thermal denaturation (melting) temperature (Tm). We have employed FTS to reveal changes in thermodynamic properties of Tsg101 elicited by its interaction with a small molecule. The recombinant Tsg101 fragment (amino acids 1-145), prepared as described above in Materials and Methods (but without label) has a thermal unfolding profile suitable for using FTS as a primary screen assay in HTS. A fluorescence dye Sypro\u00ae Orange (Invitrogen) was used for assay detection. The dye is excited at 473 nm and has a fluorescence emission at 610 nm. The dye binds to hydrophobic regions of a protein that are normally buried in a native protein structure. When a protein is unfolded, the dye interacts with exposed hydrophobic surfaces and the fluorescence intensity increases significantly over that observed in aqueous solution. The Tsg101 fragment was premixed at a concentration of 2 \u03bcM with a 5X concentration of Sypro\u00ae Orange in HEPES buffer (100 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5). Then 10 \u00b5l of the protein-dye mix was added to an assay plate and 10 to 50 nanoliters of compound, equal to 10 to 50 \u00b5M, were added with an acoustic transfer robot Echo550 (Labcyte, CA). The plate was shaken to ensure proper mixing, then sealed with an optical seal and centrifuged. The thermal scan was performed from 20 to 90\u00b0C with a temperature ramp rate of 0.5\u00b0C/min. Fluorescence was detected on a real-time PCR machine CFX384 (Bio-Rad Laboratories).",

Prazole Compounds: Rabeprazole, Lansoprazole, Omeprazole, Ilaprazole, Dexlansoprazole, Tenatoprazole, and Pantoprazole were from SelleckChem. Purification of Tsg101 (1-145). N-terminally His6-tagged Tsg101 UEV domain (amino acids 1-145), called Tsg101-UEV, was encoded in a pET-28b vector (Novagen -EMD Millipore), which also included a thrombin protease cleavage site (His6-Thrombin Site-Tsg101, 1-145). Tsg101-UEV was grown in LB broth with Kanamycin (30 \u00b5g/ml) in ROSETTA 2 (DE3) pLysS E. coli competent cells (EMD Millipore) and induced with 1 mM IPTG at room temperature for 3 h. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 0 C. Bacteria were suspended in 50 ml binding buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 M NaCl, 5 mM Imidazole) with 1 mM PMSF, 0.1% NP40, and a Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet (Roche) and sonicated for 3.5 min on ice. The sonicate was spun at 9,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 0 C in a Sorvall centrifuge. The supernatant was collected and passed through a 1.5 ml Ni-NTA Agarose column. The column was washed with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 M NaCl, 30 mM Imidazole wash buffer. The column was then equilibrated with TEV cleavage buffer followed by 50 units of thrombin in the same buffer (Novagene). The column flow was stopped and incubated at room temperature overnight. The cleaved protein was eluted with wash buffer, and the protein dialyzed in D-tube Dialyzer Maxi, MWCO 12-14 kDa (Novagene) overnight against 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1 M HEPES, pH 7.5 buffer. The protein was concentrated in a MicroSep Advanced Centrifugal Device, 12-14 kDa exclusion (Pall) for 1 h at 1,300 rpm). Protein concentration was determined with a Nano Drop Spectrophotometer at 280 nM. When the His tag was not removed, the protein was eluted from the Ni-NTA column with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 M NaCl, 1 M Imidazole. The protein was evaluated by SDS-PAGE gel for purity.Fluorescence thermal shift (FTS) screening to identify small molecule binding to Tsg101-UEV.",

Vero cells (0.8 x 10 6 cells/well of a 6-well plate) were infected with HSV-1 or HSV-2 at a MOI of 0.1 in DMEM with 1% serum for two hours in the C02 incubator at 37 o C. The cell supernatants were aspirated and replaced with 1 ml (24 h) or 2 ml (48 h and 72 h) of DMEM with 1% serum with DMSO or different concentrations of drug dissolved in DMSO. After 24 or 48 h incubation, the cell supernatant was collected and frozen at -80 o C. Virus titer in the cell media fraction was determined by standard plaque assays where cell supernatants were serially diluted, added to Vero cells and incubated for 48 h after which cells were fixed and stained to count the plaques(22). For determination of total virus (extracellular + cytoplasmic), virus infected cells were incubated for 24 h with and without drug presence, then the plate of cells were subjected to 3 cycles of freeze/thawing (-80 o C/37 o C) 30 min each prior to collecting the supernatant after centrifugation for measurement of total virus titer. Virus titer was measured by standard plaque assay as above. In separate experiments, uninfected Vero cells were carried for 3 weeks in culture in the presence or absence of drugs (replaced every third day) and found to exhibit the same growth rate detected with a light microscope.HIV-1 infection of 293T cells. 293T cells (AmericanType Culture Collection) were grown in a 24-well Clear Flat Bottom TC-treated Multiwell Cell Culture Plate using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) containing fetal bovine serum (10%), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin, and 292 \u00b5g/ml l-glutamine (Cellgro). Cells were grown to 60-70% confluency at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 prior to addition of drug treatment. Culture media was aspirated and replaced with media containing drug compound 7 hours prior to transfection of the plasmid encoding the HIV-1 genome. Transfection was done using reagent Polyethyleneimine (PEI, Polysciences). For production of virus particles, cells were transfected with pR9-HIV-1Ba-L plasmid. After 24 h and 48 h, tissue culture media was collected and passed through a 0.45 micron filter. Virus released from cells was quantified by media-associated p24 determined by ELISA (PerkinElmer) and equivalent amounts of p24. Drug potency and cell toxicity. EC50 calculations were determined by using AAT Bioquest's EC50 calculator. Cell toxicity at different concentrations of drugs as indicated was determine using the Cell Proliferation Reagent WST-1 (Roche Diagnostics) or cellular 96\u00ae Aqueous One Reagent viability reagent according to manufacturer's instructions. For 293T cells, the concentration of DMSO was 0.2% or less and assays were carried out with DMEM with 10% serum. Transmission electron Microscopy. Vero cells on glass cover slips were infected with HSV-2 at a MOI of 0.1 for two hours. Then 105 \u00b5M of tenatoprazole or 18 \u00b5M Ilaprazole was added and cells incubated for 24 hours. Tissue samples were fixed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer pH 7.3 containing 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde and post-fixed with 2% osmium tetroxide in unbuffered aqueous solution. The samples were rinsed with distilled water, en bloc stained with 3% uranyl acetate, rinsed with distilled water, dehydrated in ascending grades of ethanol, transitioned with propylene oxide, embedded in the resin mixture of Embed 812 kit and cured in a 60\u02daC oven. Samples were sectioned on a Leica Ultracut UC6 ultramicrotome. 1 \u00b5m thick sections were collected and stained with Toluidine Blue O and 70 nm sections were collected on 200 mesh copper grids; thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and Reynolds lead citrate.
