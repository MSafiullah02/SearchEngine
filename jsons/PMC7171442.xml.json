            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive strand RNA viruses belong to the order of Nidovirales and three families including Arteriviridae, Coronaviridae, and Roniviridae [1]. Based on the genetic studies, CoVs are classified to into four genera including alpha, beta, gamma, and delta CoVs. The diameter of CoVs is between 80 to 120 nm and their shape is spherical. The spike projections of these virions give the appearance of solar corona to the CoVs. The main structural proteins of CoVs are envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), and spike (S). The S proteins comprise N-linked signal peptide to be transferred to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and consequently glycosylated in ER [2]. The homotrimeric structure of S glycoproteins on the surface of the CoVs mediate the attachment of virions to the cell receptors [3]. The size of positive-sense RNA genome of CoVs is between 26.2 and 31.7 kb. The RNA genome composes of six to ten open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1a as the longest part of the RNA encodes for the replicases and ORF1b expresses for two large polyproteins including pp1a and pp1ab comprising about 4000 and 7000 amino acids. The expression of pp1ab polyprotein is essential for programmed ribosomal frame shifting signal by bridging between ORF1a and ORF1ab [4]. In the CoVs, the frameshifting signal is led to the expression of a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), which is required for the coronavirus replication [5]. The polyproteins of CoVs are cleaved by virus-encoded cysteine proteinases comprise papain- and chymotrypsin-like proteases into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp) including the expression of nsp1 to nsp11 by ORF1a and encoding nsp12 to nsp16 by ORF1b [6]. The nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6 contain hydrophobic transmembrane domains, which are considered as the anchor sites of pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins to membranes during the first step of formation of replication-transcription complexes (RTC). Further study defined that two out of three hydrophobic domains in nsp3 and six out of seven hydrophobic domains in nsp6 span the membrane, while four hydrophobic domains in nsp4 span to lipid bilayer [7]. On the other hand, ORF1b-encoded nsps including nsp12 has the RdRP activity, nsp13 has the helicase activity, nsp14 has the 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 exonuclease and RNA cap N7-guanine methyltransferase and activities for proofreading in association with nsp7/nsp8/nsp12 complex, and nsp15 has the endoribonuclease activity. The nsp16 has the methyltransferase activity, which in combination with helicase/triphosphatase, nsp13, and 2\u2032O-MTase, a replication-transcription machinery is constituted to enable the CoVs in the RNA synthesis and processing steps [8].",

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was the causative agent of 2002\u20132003 outbreak that occurred in the Guangdong Province of China with mortality rate of 9% and 774 total deaths [10]. It is accepted that SARS-CoV was originated in Chinese bats that contain SARS-related CoVs with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the same host receptor, although the population working in the wet animal markets were the seropositive cases. In 2012, the CoVs were mutated to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) or camel flu and obtained the human-to-human capability from the camel origin with mortality rate of 40% and 333 total deaths. The host cell receptor for MERS-CoV is Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), which is present in some other animal cells including bats, camels, horses, and rabbits [11, 12]. Up to 2019, the positive cases of MERS-CoV infection were 2374 and 823 total deaths from 27 countries [13]. Since the mouse model doesn\u2019t express the DPP4 cell receptor, the vaccine studies against the MERS-CoV infection were focused on other vaccine model animals including Macaca mulatta (Rhesus macaques) [14, 15], Callithrix jacchus (common marmoset) [15\u201317], Camelus dromedarius (Dromedary camels) [18], hDPP4-transduced mice [19], transgenic mice expressing hDPP4 globally [20], hDPP4-humanized transgenic mice [21], CRISPR/Cas9-engineered mice [22], and hDPP4-knockin mice using CRISPR/Cas9 [23]. Since the big animals are not economic and easy handling, it is preferred that the smaller model animals with available testing vaccine efficiency methods to be applied in the MERS-CoV vaccine studies [24]. In addition, some potential vaccine candidates were produced against MERS-CoV infection using viral vectors including recombinant human adenovirus encoding for S protein [25\u201327], recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus encoding for S protein [28, 29], modified vaccinia virus Ankara encoding for S protein [29\u201331] and N protein [32], recombinant human adenovirus encoding for S protein with nanoparticle [33], DNA vaccine encoding for S protein [34\u201336], subunit vaccines for S protein, receptor binding domain of S protein, and recombinant N-terminal domain [37\u201348], virus-like particles encoding for S protein with nanoparticles [49\u201353], nanoparticles with ferritin displaying receptor-binding domain of S protein [54], inactivated whole- MERS-CoV [55\u201357], and live-attenuated MERS-CoV [58\u201362].",

These identities demonstrated that COVID-19 in Iran had the Wuhan origin of China, which was transmitted by human-to-human epidemiological pattern following a pandemic outbreak in other Asian Southeast countries such as Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea [68]. The protein modelling of the partial ORF1ab polyprotein sequence from the Iranian patient and detecting the NMR structure with PDB entry ID: 2GDT approved that the subject protein sequence from the Iranian patient is a part of nsp1 from SARS-CoV-2, which was 83% identical to the nsp1 from SARS-CoV. As it was identified, nsp1 is encoded by ORF1a and is highly conserved, crucial to the virus replication, survival in the society and spread among susceptible populations, and can be a potential virulence factor in COVID-19 through accelerating the cellular RNA degradation and consequently blocking the human immune response [69]. Since the BLASTP E-value scores for nsp1 from various isolates of SARS-CoV showed high percentage of identity, it was highly possible that the analyzed protein sequence was nsp1 and the Iranian patient had been affected by the virulence effect of identified nsp1 of SARS-CoV-2. The antigenicity prediction of the partial ORF1ab polyprotein or nsp1 sequence from the Iranian patient defined that firstly hydrophobic and secondly hydrophilic amino acids of the first ranked antigenic domain of partial nsp1 of the patient displayed higher antigenic properties with accessibility to the human immune system such as Gly94, Pro98, and Gly101. The previous studies showed that diversity of pathogenic and venomous living organisms produce glycine-proline rich antigens in the secretions or venoms [70\u201373]. Furthermore, glycine, proline, as well as hydrophobic amino acids were exposed on the surface of partial nsp1 of SARS-CoV-2 to play as a part of a virulence factor (nsp1) and stimulate the human immune system [74, 75].",
