D4 can also recognize the peptide in the endogenous form when presented by the HLA\u2010A*0201+, HPV16 transformed cell line CaSki (Fig. 1\na). Western blot analysis carried out in our laboratory15 has shown that CaSki has low levels of the antigen processing and presenting molecules LMP 2 and 7, and TAP 1 and 2. Killing of CaSki cells by D4 therefore suggests the generation of this epitope is not limited by low level expression of these proteins. This is further supported by the data observed with the C33A cells. Western blot analysis has shown these cells to have almost undetectably low levels of LMP 2 and 7 and TAP 1 and 2.15 Once these cells have been transfected to express HPV 16 E6 and E7 they are recognized and lysed by D4. This is in contrast to the activity of 7E7. This clone is unable to kill CaSki cells in 51Cr release assays unless the cells have been pulsed with exogenous peptide (Fig. 1\nb). This suggests that generation of this epitope may be limited by antigen processing defects in CaSki cells, despite the report that CaSki has 200 copies of the HPV genome.20 This is supported by the results seen with the C33A HPV16 cells. These cells, which have low levels of the molecules involved in antigen processing and presentation, are not killed by 7E7.",

Therefore the lack of recognition of HPV31 E711\u201320 by HPV16 E711\u201320 CTL is due to effects on both TCR contact residues and peptide binding.
