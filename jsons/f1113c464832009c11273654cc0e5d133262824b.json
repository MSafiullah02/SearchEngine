However, there are clear issues with this broad definition due to suicide attempts (SAs) during which the individual's life does not end, which may be due to nonlethal means or rapid medical intervention. Intentionality is a key philosophical and psychological component but cannot always be determined by outside investigators or even consciously by the suicidal individual (M\u00fcnster & Broz, 2016) . Impulsivity is also a heterogeneous concept that harbors inaccurate implications as it relates to suicide (Cole et al. 2019 ). Suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) come in many forms, including not only SAs but nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and other risk-taking behaviors such as drug and alcohol use (Ammerman et al. 2016) , reckless driving (Start et al. 2018) , and hostile behavior (McKinney et al. 2017) . These behaviors are provoked by psychosocial stressors and associated with suicide deaths (Athey et al., 2018) . Suicide rates are known to peak in the summer months and drop in winter months (Kim et al., 2004; Sawa et al., 2016) . Interestingly, the effects of sunshine are thought to implicate the serotonergic system, though one study found that the relationship between suicide and sunshine became non-significant when controlling for season. This relationship became significant among individuals undergoing selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment (Makris et al., 2016) .",

In terms of fatal injuries, approximately one-third of motor vehicle-related deaths in Iran occur in the summer months (Khorshidi et al., 2016) . Trafficrelated traumatic brain injuries in the Slovak Republic have also been noted to be highest in the summer months (Taylor et al., 2020) .

Changes in these risk factors both impact and are impacted by the external environment, which is often comprised of recursive events that have variable impacts across individuals. In fact, one study found that those who experience the death of loved ones by suicide experience long-term emotional turmoil, presenting as its own risk factor for their own suicides (Pompili et al., 2013) . This is important because it is estimated that 135 people are exposed to each suicide death, resulting in roughly 6.9 million exposed survivors each year (Cerel et al., 2018) . From a neurobiological perspective, serotonergic system alterations is one of the most common findings in suicide research, including expression of 5hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor subtypes, downregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and epigenetic alterations such as histone and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation modifications (Gould et al., 2017) .

Further, sex, suicidal status, and their interaction were found to have statistically significant effects on prolactin levels independent of FT3 values, suggesting that biological mechanisms extend beyond 5-HT and BDNF.

Furthermore, it is a warranted speculation that suicide rates are likely higher than those reported due to a multitude of factors. This article focuses specifically on suicide fatalities as they relate to unintentional and undetermined injury fatalities deemed nonsuicidal in an effort to determine whether or not these rates are rising consistently with those attributed to suicide. It is hypothesized that, if associations between suicide and undetermined injury fatalities exist and suicides are being reported appropriately, these rates will also be associated. However, with a rise in concern related to suicide and substantial growth in extant literature on the subject, this may not be the case.",

Third, educational attainment is a component excluded from the dataset that would further inform interpretation.

(2011) reported that validity and reliability issues remained questionable, as suicide notes are one of very few pieces of evidence that can truly verify a suicide decedent's intentions prior to the act. In highly vulnerable populations, such as the military, self-reports and open communication regarding ideation is often limited if not absent, such that limited evidence may exist to suggest intent to die even if they would be predicted to be ideators(Anestis et al. 2017;Vannoy et al. 2016).With the incessantly rising suicide rates in the U.S. remaining at a relatively steady percentage of total deaths across all causes, it is worth considering where other increases are located (Drapeau & McIntosh, 2016; Web-Based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System",

However, according to the AAS (2018; 2020), both 2017 and 2018 have already exceeded these estimates by 1,120.5 and 1,201, respectively. Increases in suicide deaths in recent years have more than doubled the average increase observed from 2012-2016. If extended to 2018, the average rate change equals 1,691, suggesting that suicide deaths in 2020, if this extended trend remains relatively consistent, will equate to 51,726a 27.4% increase since 2012.
