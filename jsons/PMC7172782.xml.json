The disease continued to spread until winter, when the shelducks and geese in the provinces of Shandong, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi were under a huge threat by this pathogen (Huang et al., 2013). Affected egg-laying ducks showed a reduction in egg production of 20\u201390% (Wang et al., 2011). Other clinical signs included acute anorexia, antisocial behavior, rhinorrhea, diarrhea, ataxia, and paralysis, with a morbidity of 100% and mortality of 5\u201330%, possibly due to secondary bacterial infections (Yan et al., 2011). Recent studies indicated that domestic chickens were susceptible to this emerging disease with similar clinical signs (Cao et al, 2011, Liu et al, 2012a, Liu et al, 2012b, Su et al, 2011, Tang et al, 2012). The new disease has become one of the most economically important infectious diseases of ducks in China (Wang et al., 2011).",

Many, such as Japanese encephalitis virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus can lead to signs from mild febrile disease, encephalitis, hemorrhagic fever, and shock syndrome to death in both humans and animals (Brault et al., 2011). The flavivirus genome, is approximately 10.5 kb which contains one single open reading frame (ORF) and encodes a polyprotein (Zou et al., 2009). The polyprotein is then cleaved into three structural proteins (capsid [C]; membrane [M], and envelope [E]) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, NS5) by viral and cellular protease, and these nonstructural proteins are responsible for virus replication, proteolysis, and maturation (Lindenbach, Rice, 2003, Mukhopadhyay et al, 2005).",

In addition, E protein mediates virus and host membrane fusion in the acidic milieu of the late endosomes (Chu, Ng, 2004, Heinz, Allison, 2003). E protein consists of three domains: a structurally central amino terminal domain (domain I, DI), a dimerization domain (domain II, DII) and a carboxyl terminal Ig-like domain (domain III, DIII) (Rey et al., 1995). As a central unit of E protein complex, DI adopts \u03b2-barrel structure and acts as a bridge-like hinge linking the extended DII and the globular DIII together. Histidines in the hinge region are important triggers for conformation change of DII and DIII upon pH change in the processes of viral and cell membrane fusion and homodimer formation/dissociation. DII is composed of two segments that project from loops of DI. The large segment of DII, which is composed of twisted \u03b2 strands, is stabilized by disulfide bonds and contains a highly conserved hydrophobic fusion loop at its tip, known as the fusion peptide (FP). The FP is responsible for the direct interaction with target membrane when fusogenic conformation is achieved (Mendes et al, 2012, Yu et al, 2013). DIII is located at the C-terminus of E protein and contains several epitopes which can elicit virus-neutralizing antibodies (Chu et al., 2005). In addition, other studies have shown that DIII mediated flavivirus attachment to host cells (Anderson, 2003).",
