            "text": "Antibodies are valuable molecules for the diagnostic and treatment of diseases caused by pathogens and toxins. Traditionally, these antibodies are generated by hybridoma technology. An alternative to hybridoma technology is the use of antibody phage display to generate recombinant antibodies. This in vitro technology circumvents the limitations of the immune system and allows-in theory-the generation of antibodies against all conceivable molecules. Phage display technology enables obtaining human antibodies from na\u00efve antibody gene libraries when either patients are not available or immunization is not ethically feasible. On the other hand, if patients or immunized/infected animals are available, it is common to construct immune phage display libraries to select in vivo affinity-matured antibodies. Because the phage packaged DNA sequence encoding the antibodies is directly available, the antibodies can be smoothly engineered according to the requirements of the final application. In this review, an overview of phage display derived recombinant antibodies against bacterial, viral, and eukaryotic pathogens as well as toxins for diagnostics and therapy is given.",

In the past-and still today-polyclonal antibodies were produced as serum in animals like horses [4] . A milestone in antibody generation was the development of hybridoma technology that allows the production of monoclonal antibodies [5] . But the hybridoma technology has drawbacks like limited number of candidates, possible instability of the aneuploid cell lines [6], inability to provide antibodies against highly conserved antigens and most of all its limited application to generate human antibodies [7] . The hybridoma technology essentially gives murine antibodies that can be used for diagnostic or research purposes. However, their therapeutic applications are limited because repeated administration of murine antibodies can cause human anti-mouse antibody reaction, reducing antibody half-life and leading to severe side effects such as anaphylactic shock [8] . A strategy to circumvent these problems is antibody humanization or the use of transgenic animals in which the original antibody gene repertoire is replaced with a human gene repertoire [9] [10] [11] [12] . Another strategy is the human hybridoma technology resulting in human antibodies [13, 14] , although this technology has the same problems of the murine hybridoma technology regarding the limitation of the immune system.",

Two different genetic systems have been developed for the expression of the antibody::pIII (phage protein III) fusion proteins for phage display. First, the antibody genes can be directly inserted into the phage genome fused upstream of the wild-type pIII gene [20] . Second, most successful systems, uncouple antibody expression from phage propagation by providing the genes encoding the antibody::pIII fusion proteins on a separate plasmid (called \"phagemid\") that contains a phage morphogenetic signal for packaging the vector into the phage particles [18] . No matter the used phage display system, antibody fragments are displayed on the surface of M13 phage and the corresponding antibody gene is packaged in the phage particle. Other phage display technologies using phage lambda [21] or T7 [22] are less suitable for the display of antibody fragments. In addition, these phages are lytic phage that aggravates the practical work. The most common antibody formats used for antibody phage display are the single chain fragment variable (scFv) [23] [24] [25] or fragment antigen binding (Fabs) [26, 27] . Other antibody formats used for phage display are single chain Fabs (scFab), human VH domains (dAbs), the variable domains of camel heavy chains (VHHs) and immunoglobulins of sharks (IgNARs) [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Figure 1 shows an antibody phage and different antibody fragments. For veterinary research, chicken libraries are often used [34, 35] . In contrast to what occurs in humans, the diversity of chicken antibody genes is the result of gene conversion, and the N-and C-terminal parts of chicken's VH and VL are always identical, facilitating antibody gene amplification, and library cloning [36, 37] . Also rabbit phage display was used to generate antibodies against pathogens [38] .",

An other option is the panning in solution using biotinylated antigens followed by a \"pull-down\" with streptavidin beads [41] . The vast excess of nonbinding antibody phage will be removed by stringent washing. Subsequently, the bound antibody phage will be eluted, e.g. by pH shift or trypsin, and reamplified by infection of E. coli. After infection of the phagemid bearing E. coli with a helperphage, new antibody phage will be produced. The selection cycle will be repeated and the number of antigen-specific antibody phage clones should increase with every panning round. Usually 2-3 panning rounds are performed. Finally, monoclonal antibody phage or monoclonal soluble antibodies can be identified by, e.g. ELISA [42] , immunoblot [40] , or flow cytometry [43] . The antibody fragment genes can be subcloned into any other antibody format, e.g. scFv-Fc or IgG [23, 27, 42, 44, 45] . A schema of the selection process is given in Fig. 2 .",

            "text": "Regarding the source of genes, antibodies can be selected from two types of libraries: immune libraries and universal libraries. Immune libraries are constructed from immunized/infected donors and typically used in medical research to obtain an antibody against a particular target antigen, e.g. an infectious pathogen like Ebola virus [46] . An advantage of this kind of library is that the V-genes contain hypermutations and are affinity matured, although its development can be restricted to ethical constraints. The alternative are universal or \"single pot\" libraries, which includes na\u00efve, semisynthetic and synthetic libraries that are designed to isolate antibody fragments binding to every possible antigen, at least in theory [44, 47] . Na\u00efve libraries are constructed from rearranged V genes from B cells (IgM) of nonimmunized donors. Examples for this library type are the na\u00efve human Fab library constructed by de Haard and colleagues [26] and the HAL scFv libraries [23, 48] . Semisynthetic libraries are constructed from unrearranged V genes from pre-B cells (germline cells) [49] or from one antibody framework [50] in which one or several CDRs, but always the CDR H3, are randomized. Often used semisynthetic libraries are the Tomlinson I and J libraries using one defined framework VH3-23 and Kappa IKV1-39 with randomized CDR2 and CDR3 [51] .",

Currently, two recombinant antibodies are approved for the treatment of pathogens or toxins. Raxibacumab is a human antibody for anthrax treatment derived from a phage display library from Cambridge Antibody Technology (now Medimmune, part of AstraZeneca) in cooperation with Human Genome Science (now GlaxoSmithKline) [64] . The antibody palivizumab for the treatment of Respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis is a classical humanized antibody [65] . A further antibody, but also not derived from phage display, the Clostridium difficile antibody bezlotoxumab is in clinical phase 3 [66] .",

In general, cultural and microbial detection of bacteria is regarded as standard in diagnostics for many pathogens, e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis [71] or Salmonella Typhimurium [72] . Since these methods are often time-consuming and require experienced lab personal, high throughput analysis is often limited. Real-time PCR measurements have been developed for the diagnostics of many bacteria [73] , offering high sensitivity and specificity of detection. But sample treatment is still needed in many cases, including expensive and complex laboratory devices [74] . An other approach is MS for diagnostic, but this technology needs expensive devices [75] . Antibody-based diagnostic like ELISA would be more simple and easy to use, also in developing countries.",

            "text": "Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), a pathogen with particular cell wall and membrane characteristics that is able to infect and multiply within alveolar macrophages leading to cough, weakness, and fever [92] . In 2013, 9 million people were infected and 1.5 million died worldwide [93] . In order to improve treatment and control disease spread, TB must be diagnosed as early as possible. One prominent target for this purpose is the bacterial Antigen 85 (Ag85) that is the most abundant protein secreted by Mtb [94] . It is a complex of three highly homolog proteins (Ag85A, Ag85B, and Ag85C) with a molecular size of 30-32 kDa each [95] . In a novel approach by Ferrara et al. [68] monoclonal antibodies were selected against the Ag85 complex by combining phage-and yeast-display. First, a na\u00efve scFv-library was preselected against Ag85 by phage display, reducing the diversity from \u00df10 11 unique scFv clones to \u00df10 5 colony forming units. Second, the enriched sublibrary was cloned into a yeast-display system. Each clone of the selection output was screened individually for antigen binding by FACS. Those with the highest antigenbinding signals were sorted and further analyzed. In total 192 clones were sequenced revealing 111 genetically unique scFv clones. Further screening assays identified seven antibody pairs, which can detect Ag85 down to a concentration of 6.1 nM in the absence of serum and 22.7 nM in its presence. Interestingly, none of the antibodies were absolutely specific for one of the Ag85 subunits of the complex. All three subunits A, B, and C were bound although not equally. In contrast, Fuchs et al. selected five human antibodies against the recombinant Ag85B protein from the na\u00efve HAL7/8 libraries [81] . Three of them bound specifically to the 85B protein in ELISA (LOD: 5 ng/mL). Even sandwich detection of recombinant 85B in ELISA (LOD: 10 ng/mL) and integration into lateral flow immuno assay (LOD: <5 ng/mL) was shown. But antigen detection in Mtb cell extracts or culture filtrates was restricted to direct ELISA and immunoblot assay. The authors of both papers argued that the selected antibodies must be affinity matured in order to reach required detection limits. Successful implementation of this concept was demonstrated by Sixholo et al. [80] . Chicken antibodies were selected from the semisynthetic Nkuku library against a 16 kDa recombinant antigen of M. tuberculosis, also known as heat shock protein X (HspX). After four rounds of panning, three scFvs were identified in ELISA. The clone with the lowest ELISA signal was selected for in vitro engineering using two different approaches. First, a mutant library was generated from the parental scFv by error-prone PCR with a diversity of \u00df3 \u00d7 10 7 unique scFv. This library was selected again on the HspX antigen under more stringent conditions, leading to identification of three mutant scFvs. These contained one or three individual amino acid exchanges, occuring both in CDR and framework regions. All mutants showed increased ELISA-binding signals, reaching a signal \u00df11 times higher when compared to the parental scFv. Furthermore, the mutants showed improved association and dissociation kinetics in ELISA and SPR analysis. In the other approach, the length of the scFv linker was reduced from 15 amino acids to a single glycine residue, forcing tetramerization of antibodies. Due to cooperative binding, the apparent functional affinity was improved. In ELISA, tetrameric scFv generated a \u00df14 times higher ELISA signal, and SPR proved increased association and decreased dissociation rates.",

[67] generated a na\u00efve antibody library from camels with a diversity of \u00df5 \u00d7 10 7 clones. A special feature is that the antibodies consist of a single monomeric VHH domain, also called nanobodies. Advantages of this format are the small size (\u00df15 kDa), the ease production in E. coli, and the convex paratope that is formed which enables the targeting of cryptic epitopes. The library was selected on immobilized RgpB. One clone was isolated that binds specifically to cell surface displayed and soluble RgpB with an affinity of 362 pM. A detection limit of \u00df8 \u00d7 10 6 cells/mL of saliva was reached when tested by subtractive inhibition ELISA. But catalytic activity of RgpB was not inhibited by antibody binding.",

The genus Orthopoxvirus includes various species such as monkeypox virus, cowpox virus, and especially variola virus that is the causative agent of smallpox in humans. Naturally occurring smallpox has been eradicated in 1977 because of a massive WHO vaccination program that began in 1967. However, no vaccination of the civilian population is conducted nowadays. The potential threat of intentional release has renewed the search for safe and effective smallpox vaccines as case fatality rates of 30% or more among unvaccinated subjects are reported [133] . Because orthopoxviruses are highly related, it is assumed, that immunity against one poxvirus goes along with immunity against most members of the entire virus family [132, 134] . Using an immune scFv phage display library constructed from vaccinia virus immunized patients, a panel of human vaccinia-specific antibodies was selected. Plaque-reduction neutralization tests revealed that seven of these antibodies neutralized vaccinia as well as cowpox virus in vitro. Five of those antibodies additionally neutralized monkeypox virus [124] . Other antibodies were generated from a Fab immune library derived from vaccinia virus immunized chimpanzee. Converted into a chimeric chimpanzee/human IgG format, two antibodies displayed high affinities to vaccinia protein B5 (K d of 0.2 and 0.7 nM). Antibody 8AH8AL was neutralizing in vitro for vaccinia and smallpox virus and proofed to be protective in mice challenged with vaccinia virus even when administered 2 days after challenge. In this model 8AH8AL proved to provide significantly greater protection than that of the previously isolated rat anti-B5 antibody 19C2 [135] . Vaccinia had to be used as model, because the final confirmation of protection against smallpox is not possible.",

In addition to public health concerns associated with natural outbreaks, Ebola virus might be a potential agent of biological warfare and bio-terrorism [136] . Human antibodies directed against Ebola virus were selected from a library originated from patients that recovered from infection in the 1995 Ebola virus outbreak in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of Congo [137] . Several antibodies against various viral proteins such as nucleoprotein, envelope glycoprotein, and secreted envelope glycoprotein have been isolated in this study. One antibody (KZ52), specific for envelope glycoprotein, was able to neutralize in vitro as Fab (50% neutralization at 0.4 g/mL) and as full IgG (90% neutralization at 2.6 g/mL) [46] . Follow-up studies were showing effective protection in vivo in a Guinea pig Ebola challenge model when the antibody was administered up to one hour postviral challenge [138] . Interestingly, KZ52 was not protective in macaques challenged with Ebola even if the antibody was given as a two-dose treatment with the first dose one day prior viral challenge and the second dose 4 days postchallenge [139] . A murine scFv and two shark IgNAR V immune libraries were generated against inactivated Zaire Ebola virus to yield various antibodies specific for the viral matrix protein VP40 and the viral nucleoprotein [136] . Interestingly, this work represents the first example of a successful targeted IgNAR V isolation from a shark immune response library. Dengue virus (DENV), a member of the Flaviviridae family, is responsible for at least 100 million symptomatic infections each year and became a major health and economic burden in over 50 countries worldwide [140] [141] [142] . It is a positive strand RNA virus with a \u00df11 kb genome, that compromise a single open reading frame. The four circulating serotypes of dengue virus show approximately 70% sequence homology [128, 141] . Fab monoclonal antibodies to dengue type 4 virus were isolated from a chimpanzee immune library. Two Fab, namely 5H2 and 5D9 neutralized DENV-4 efficiently with a titer of 0.24-0.58 g/mL by plague reduction neutralization test [143] . Another study selected human scFv antibodies specific to dengue virus envelope protein by panning against recombinant full-length envelope protein and its domain III [102] . Because DENV envelope protein is an essential molecule for virion assembly and virus entry, scFvs selected in this study were shown to exhibit inhibitory effects on DENV infection in vitro [102] . Dengue nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) is essential for viral replication and host immune response modulation, making it an excellent target for dengue-inhibiting antibodies. A na\u00efve human Fab-phage library was screened for NS5-specific antibody fragments using various NS5 variants from Dengue Virus serotypes 1-4 as antigens for panning and characterization [128] . Using NS5 from alternating dengue serotypes for each round of panning, this strategy resulted in the identification of two clones that are cross-reactive against all four dengue serotypes. Another study selected antibodies using phage display by panning with Dengue virus particles directly captured from supernatant of infected Vero cells. Here, highly serotype-specific antibodies were generated. From a total of nine antibodies, seven were shown to be specific to only one serotype. One Dengue-3 selected clone cross-reacted with Dengue 1, whereas another clone showed cross-reactivity with all serotypes despite being selected solely on Dengue 2 particles. Interestingly, all of the obtained antibodies recognized several strains of distinct genotypes within the corresponding serotype [101] . Panning against dengue envelope protein resulted in the identification of an antibody (C9) from a mouse/human chimeric Fab library that cross-reacts with DENV1-3 and neutralizes DENV2 in cell-based assays after conversion into full-length IgG [141] . Besides scFv and Fab, variable domain heavy-chain antibodies (VHH antibodies) were also selected using phage display technology. After four rounds of panning on recombinant DENV 2 NS1 protein, 20 positive clones were selected. Affinity measurements with NS1 revealed a K D value of 2.79 \u00d7 10 \u22128 M for the best VHH antibody P2 [122] .",

            "text": "Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), an alphavirus of the Togoviridae family, causes equine epidemics but can also cause encephalitis in humans [144, 145] . Because this virus is classified as Category B agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), much research has been done to generate neutralizing antibodies against it. Antibodies were generated from an immune library from human donors targeting both VEEV envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 [146] . The isolated Fabs L1A7 and F5 were neutralizing in vitro, with F5 being 300 times more effective than L1A7. Subsequently, F5 was converted into full IgG format and was employed to generate neutralization-escape variants of VEEV for epitope mapping. Within another study, an immune macaque library was used to generate human-like antibodies [119] . One of these antibodies, scFv-Fc ToR67-3B4, was protective in mice when administered 6 h postviral challenge with VEEV Trinidiad strains, showing 80-100% survival after a challenge with 100-fold LD 50 . However, scFv-Fc ToR67-3B4 was not able to neutralize Trinidad strain in vitro, but other VEEV strains instead, showing that neutralization is not mandatory for an in vivo protective antibody [119] . Another study describes the selection of antibodies from a human na\u00efve scFv gene library using complete, active VEEV particles as antigen. In this case, specific detection of the VEEV strains TC83, H12/93, and 230 by the selected antibodies was proven. Remarkably, none of the selected scFv phage clones showed cross-reactivity with Alphavirus species of the Eastern equine encephalitis virus and WEEV antigenic complex or with Chikungunya virus, making them ideal tools for the immunological detection and diagnostic of Alphavirus species [105] . Two different scFv antibody libraries were constructed from WEEV immunized macaques. Subcloned as scFv-Fc, three antibodies from these libraries specifically bound WEEV in ELISA with little or no cross-reactivity with other alphaviruses and were found to be neutralizing in vitro. In this study, the first antibodies against WEEV, that were shown to be neutralizing in vitro, were developed. About 1 ng/mL of the best antibody (ToR69-3A2) neutralized 50% of 5 \u00d7 10 4 TCID50/mL WEEV [109] .",

Due to many genetic events, such as antigenic drift and shift, new influenza variants will occur in the future and will challenge vaccine and diagnostic development [147, 148] . Different groups developed antibodies by phage display against influenza viruses. Sui et al. [104] selected antibodies from a nonimmune scFv library against the H5 hemagglutinin ectodomain. Hemagglutinin is a trimer and the extracelluar part consists of a stalk domain and a globular head domain [149] . They identified ten antibodies binding to the trimeric H5, but not monomeric H5. Interestingly, nine of these antibodies shared the same germline framework (VH1-69). These antibodies were converted into IgG1 and were protective in mice with 10 or 15 mg/kg in a prophylactic or therapeutic challenge model, respectively. Very remarkably, some antibodies crossneutralized H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, and H9 influenza strains. These are phage display derived antibodies that are candidates for broad-spectrum influenza immunotherapy [104] .",

Invasive aspergillosis occurs in immunocompromised individuals for example after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or solid organ transplantation [172] . Due to its severity, an early diagnosis is crucial for a successful treatment. In 2009, Sch\u00fctte et al. [41] reported the generation of several antibodies binding specifically to Crf2, an A. fumigates antigen of the glycosyl hydrolase family that is located in the cell wall of the growing hyphae. These antibodies could serve as tools for new diagnostic assays such as serum ELISA or histopathological immunofluorescence microscopy. The antibodies described in this study were isolated from two different phage-displayed scFv libraries: One was a macaque immune library with a theoretical diversity of 1.5 \u00d7 10 7 independent clones; while the other was human na\u00efve antibody library HAL4/7 [23] . Both libraries were used in two different panning strategies: the first was performed on recombinant antigen immobilized on immunostrips; the second was carried out in solution with biotinylated antigen. Finally, 16 individual scFv clones were selected, with six clones deriving from the na\u00efve library and ten from the immune library. Interestingly, all antibodies generated on immobilized antigen bind to linear epitopes, whereas all antibodies generated by panning in solution bind to conformational epitopes. Seven of these antibodies bound to their native antigen on growing hyphae of Aspergillus fumigatus and did not show crossreactions to other Aspergillus species or Candida albicans.",

Currently, an estimated 3.2 billion people in tropical and subtropical countries live at risk of malaria [173, 174] . In humans malaria is elicited by at least five different species of Plasmodium, P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, and P. knowlesi [175] . P. falciparum is responsible for most malaria-related deaths globally, while P. vivax is the most widespread parasite [176] . Three different approaches to generate antibodies against P. falciparum using phage display are described. In these studies various structures of different developmental stages of the parasite served as antigens. In a first study Roeffen et al. [160] used two scFv immune libraries, constructed from B-lymphocytes from P. falciparum patients with transmission-blocking immunity, to generate antibodies against Pfs48/45, a surface protein of P. falciparum that is expressed during zygote-and macrogamete stages. Pfs48/45 is a potential vaccine candidate since it is a target of transmissionblocking antibodies that are taken up by the mosquito together with the blood meal and block within the mosquito's intestinal tract the oocyte development [177] [178] [179] . The panning was performed on an extract of gametocytes immobilized in immunotubes and the elution was performed by competition with a mixture of four rat monoclonal mAbs, which recognize distinct epitopes on Pfs48/45 (epitopes I, IIb, III, and V). Interestingly, all selected 14 antibody clones bound to epitope III of Pfs48/45. In 2001, Sowa et al. [180] reported the isolation of a human monoclonal antibody against the Block 2 region of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein-1 (PfMSP-1) by phage display from a malaria patient derived scFv library. Lundquist et al. [161] generated a Fab-immune library from leukocytes of 13 adults with acquired immunity to malaria. Three individual Fabs designated RAM1, RAM2, and RAM3 were isolated from this immune library by panning on a recombinant fragment of the merozite surface protein 3 (MSP-3 ). MSP-3 is involved in heme binding, and antibodies against this protein promote eradication of the parasite by monocytes [181, 182] . A synthetic peptide of the N-terminal fragment of MSP-3 is even used in human clinical trials as vaccine [183] . The antibodies were subcloned into IgG1 and IgG3 format for further analysis. Binding of the antibodies to native parasite protein was demonstrated for all three antibodies in immuno blot and immunofluorescence microscopy. RAM1 and RAM2 also bound to their antigen in fixed and permeabilized cells in flow cytometry. The IgG3 format of RAM1 showed in a functional assay (antibody-dependent cellular inhibition assay, ACDI) an inhibition rate that is comparable to affinity-purified polyclonal anti-MSP-3 211-237 antibodies derived from immune donors. The IgG1 format also showed inhibition in the ACDI, but lower compared to IgG3 [161] . An overview of recombinant antibodies generated by phage display against eukaryotic pathogens is given in Table 3 .",

They can easily be disseminated and result in high or moderate mortality rates [184] . In this context, the antibody phage display offers a powerful tool for antibody selection and allows the isolation of neutralizing antibodies against complete active toxins or special domains by using different human na\u00efve antibody libraries with high diversity [185] [186] [187] . For toxins, the aim is to find antibodies binding to the cell binding domain of the toxin and neutralize the interaction of this domain with the corresponding cellular target, mainly cell surface proteins. But also antibodies directed against the translocation domain or the enzymatic domain can neutralize the toxicitiy. For the isolation of high-affinity antibodies against specific targets, animals are often immunized with toxoids, nontoxic subunits or selected toxin domains. Well suited are macaques for the construction of immune libraries, because macaque V-genes are very similar to their human counterparts [59, 119, [188] [189] [190] [191] .",

            "text": "So far, antibody phage display was successfully used for antibody selection against a panel of toxins classified as category A agents, such as from Clostridium botulinum (botulism) [190, [192] [193] [194] and Bacillus anthracis (anthrax) [59] and also against different category B agents, such as staphylococcal enterotoxin B [195, 196] and ricin toxin from Ricinus communis [191, 197] . An example for a high-risk microorganism that [198, 199] . Especially, serotype A is recognized as the most toxic substance known, showing LD 50 of about 1 ng/kg by intravenous route, about 10 ng/kg by the pulmonary route and about 1 g/kg for the oral route [200] . BoNTs are composed of a disulfide bond-linked 50 kDa light chain and a 100 kDa heavy chain. The heavy chain contains two functional domains (Hc and Hn) that are responsible for toxin uptake into nerve cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis and for the translocation of the light chain across the membrane into the neuronal cytosol. Whereas the catalytic domain of the light chain is responsible for the BoNT toxicity. The current approach for treatment of botulism includes the application of human anti-botulism immunoglobulins, such as BabyBIG, or equine anti-toxin serum. But the human serum stock of BabyBIG is limited and the equine anti-toxin may cause hypersensitivity and serum sickness. In these situations, antibody phage display provides a technology to generate toxinneutralizing antibodies against each serotype. For instance, a macaque immune library was used to isolate neutralizing scFv with nM affinities against the light chain of BoNT/A [190, 201, 202] , but also antibodies against the heavy chain or other relevant serotypes of BoNT are of therapeutic interest. Phage display technology was also used for isolation of single domain antibodies (VHH) after immunization of a llama with a cocktail of 7 BoNT toxoids (A-F) [193] . Another approach was the generation of a human antibody gene library after inducing a BoNT/A-specific immune response by in vitro immunization [194] . Furthermore, antibody phage display was used to generate antibodies against other clostridial toxins such as those from Clostridium tetani or Clostridium difficile [188, 203] . Anthrax, another serious infectious disease is caused by Bacillus anthracis, an aerobic, Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium that is found in soils around the world. Bacillus anthracis secrets two toxins: the lethal toxin (LT) and the edema toxin (ET) [204] . Both are composed of two subunits: the LT consists of the lethal factor (LF), and the protective antigen (PA); while the ET is formed by the edema factor, and PA. It was demonstrated that only LT has an essential role in the pathogenesis of anthrax [205] . The subunit PA is the basis of current vaccines and induces the generation of neutralizing antibodies. In combination with antibiotics, commercial monoclonal antibodies against PA, such as raxibacumab, are commonly used for treatment [206] . In 2012, the FDA approved raxibacumab to treat inhalational anthrax. Due to security issues the use of anti-PA antibodies alone is questionable, since PA could be modified and lose the recognized epitopes while retaining biological activity. An alternative to anti-PA antibodies are antibodies targeting the LF, such as 2LF, which was isolated from an immune library via antibody phage display technology [59] . A combination of an anti-PA antibody with an anti-LF antibody could lead to a synergistic effect and improve the efficacy of the therapy.",

This bacterium is a potential causative agent for food-borne illness and produces twenty-one types of staphylococcal enterotoxins that cause symptoms of food poisoning such as abdominal cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea [207, 208] . SEB is a single polypeptide of 28 kDa and is the most potent toxin secreted by S. aureus. As a superantigen, it stimulates T cells and leads to an overproduction of cytokines, causing clinical symptoms such as fever, hypertension, and in some cases death. Phage display was used to generate recombinant antibodies from a murine immune library [196] and to identify the epitope of a SEB-specific monoclonal antibody using a peptide phage library [209] . Furthermore, a human monoclonal antibody against SEB was isolated from a synthetic human antibody gene library that inhibited SEB binding to MHC-II [195] .",

RTB is a galactose-and N-acetylgalactosamine-specific lectin that binds to specific sugar residues on the cell surface, allowing internalization of the toxic RTA by endocytosis [210] . RTA is an RNA N-glycosidase that irreversibly inactivates eukaryotic ribosomes, leading to the inhibition of protein synthesis [211] . Human-like antibodies were selected by phage display from a macaque immunized with RTA. One antibody, 43RCA, had a picomolar affinity and neutralized the biological activity of ricin in vitro [191] . Furthermore, neutralizing VHH with high affinity was selected from a llama immune library. The best antibody C8 was able to neutralize 100% ricin activity in an in vitro assay using 40 g/mL VHH [197] .",

Regarding this toxin, a neutralizing antibody was isolated from a human library via phage display and was capable of protecting mice [185] . The same procedure was used for Bothrops jararacussu, a venomous pit viper species endemic in South America. By using a human antibody gene library, different antibodies were selected to inhibit the phospholipase activity of the venom in vitro and reduce the myotoxicity in vivo [214] .
