In contrast, recovery from AKI was a potent predictor of survival and good neurological outcome at discharge [5] .

The two studies did not consider AKI stage in their comparison of outcomes in patients with and without RRT. Because all patients who received RRT had stage 3 AKI, the risk of death in the RRT group was higher than that in the non-RRT group.

First, there were differences in the baseline characteristics of the study cohorts between the present study and previous ones (e.g., age, male sex, witnessed arrest, bystander CPR, time from CPR to ROSC, and shock after ROSC) [3, 4, 10, 11] . Second, there are insufficient data to determine absolute indications and the optimal timing for initiation of RRT. Moreover, some clinicians tend to delay RRT when they suspect that patients may recover on their own and because of well-known risks of RRT itself, including hypotension, arrhythmia, membrane bioincompatibility, vascular access, and anti-coagulant administration [16] . As a result, the initiation of RRT is extremely variable and based primarily on empiricism and local institutional practice and resources [17] . Therefore, it will be difficult to determine whether to provide RRT based only on whether the patient developed stage 3 AKI after OHCA. The AKI Network stated that the indications for RRT must be viewed within the context of the patient's entire clinical condition with most indications being relative; there are only a small number of absolute indications [17] . Third, the 6-month mortality of those in the RRT group with stage 3 AKI was extremely high in the present study. Moreover, a longer CPR time, lower ratio of shockable rhythm, and higher ratio of shock may underlie the high mortality in our cohort. In addition, a longer CPR time and lower ratio of shockable rhythm may underlie the higher ratio of shock in our cohort. Therefore, a large-scale multinational, multicentre study or randomised controlled trial will be needed to confirm the exact effect of RRT on the mortality after OHCA because of extremely high mortality in those with stage 3 AKI.",

Differences in disease severity, limits to defining disease severity accurately, and variability in selecting RRT could have contributed to the different results. Additional data from well-designed Table 3 Factors associated with 6-month mortality in patients who developed stage 3 acute kidney injury after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest observational studies will be needed to clarify the longterm mortality of RRT group after OHCA. Dialysis interventions were initiated within 48 h of ROSC in most cases, and the most common modality was CRRT. This may have been due to the high rate of shock after ROSC. These results are compatible with current standards because CRRT is recommended as the initial RRT modality [21] . A higher frequency of bleeding in the RRT group may have been caused by complications during the insertion of the dual-lumen haemodialysis catheter ( Table 1 ).

            "text": "The present study has several limitations. First, because we defined AKI using only SCr criteria, it is possible that we underestimated AKI prevalence in our cohort. In the case of critically ill patients, the production of SCr decreases. Additionally, a decrease in SCr could be potentiated by therapeutic hypothermia [26] . Therefore, an exact judgement on AKI status is difficult in the case of individuals treated with therapeutic hypothermia. In addition, differences in urine output and fluid balance are likely to have influenced the decision to start RRT. However, data on urine output at RRT initiation and fluid balance could not be evaluated in our cohort. Second, the present study was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected observational data that did not include information on standardised treatments or management protocols for RRT. Therefore, the risk of selection bias could have been introduced. Third, the initiation of RRT in our study was at the discretion of the physician responsible for the patient's care according to the KDIGO guideline (e.g., severe hyperkalaemia, severe acidosis, pulmonary oedema, and uremic complication). There were no consistent protocols dictating when to initiate RRT, which might have led to inconsistencies in practices among the principal investigators of each institution. A randomised controlled trial of RRT on patients with stage 3 AKI is needed to confirm the role of RRT. Fourth, there was a possibility of failure to conduct RRT even if urgent RRT was indicated because of the decision on withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy according to the neurological prognostication. However, in South Korea, the withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy depending on the neurological prognostication has not been used widely because of several reasons. For instance, the life-sustaining treatment decisions act was only applied recently in South Korea (since February 2018). In addition, legal surrogates, including family members, could not determine withdrawal of lifesustaining therapy, especially stopping the ventilator or removing the endotracheal tube owing to traditional sentiment. Therefore, we expect that decisions regarding withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy may not affect the initiation of RRT. However, there was a possibility that RRT may be stopped when a poor neurological outcome or death was expected through the treatment course, as the cost for RRT (especially continuous RRT) is quite expensive in South Korea (approximately \u20ac400 per day). Fifth, in the cohort of RRT (n = 115), 80 patients were diagnosed as achieving stage 3 AKI by initiating RRT itself (Group A) and 35 patients were diagnosed as achieving stage 3 AKI based on SCr (Group B). Although the initiation of RRT was not determined by conditions other than SCr in most cases, daily SCr of Group B was significantly higher than that of Group A (see Additional file 1, Table  S2 ). Therefore, it may be possible to compare patients reaching the AKI stage 3 by non-creatinine criteria with patients reaching the AKI stage 3 by creatinine criteria. The sixth limitation is that the results of the present study may have been affected by the characteristics of our study cohort. Therefore, the results might not be reproducible in another cohort with different characteristics. Fifth, although we excluded the patients who died within 48 h from the time of ROSC initiation to decrease problems related to competing risk, excluding these patients itself may have introduced bias.",
