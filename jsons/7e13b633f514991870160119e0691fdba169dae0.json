            "text": "Emergence of COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 demanded development of new therapeutic strategies and thus the understanding the mode of viral attachment, entry and replication has become key aspect for such interventions. The coronavirus surface features a trimeric spike (S) protein that is essential in viral attachment, entry and membrane fusion. The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for the entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. The heavily glycosylated S protein is comprised of two protein subunits (S1 and S2), and the receptor binding domain within S1 subunit binds with to the hACE2 receptor. Even though hACE2 has been known for two decades and has been recognized as the entry point of several human coronaviruses, no comprehensive glycosylation characterization of hACE2 has been reported. Herein, we describe the quantitative glycosylation mapping on hACE2 expressed in human cells by both glycoproteomics and glycomics. We observed heavy glycan occupancy at all the seven possible N-glycosylation sites and surprisingly, detected three novel O-glycosylation sites. In order to deduce the detailed structure of glycan epitopes on hACE2 involved with viral binding, we have characterized the terminal sialic acid linkages, presence of bisecting GlcNAc and also the pattern of N-glycan fucosylation. We have conducted extensive manual interpretation of each glycopeptide and glycan spectra in addition to the use of bioinformatics tools to validate the hACE2 glycosylation.",

            "text": "Located on the viral surface is the spike (S) protein, which attaches the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen to target cells in the human body. The trimeric spike protein belongs to the class I fusion proteins. Its two subunits S1 and S2 orchestrate its entry into the cell: First, the S1 subunit facilitates the attachment of the virus via its receptor binding domain (RBD) to the host cell receptor, and secondly the S2 subunit mediates the fusion of the viral and human cellular membranes (Hoffmann et al. 2020; Shang et al. 2020; Walls et al. 2020) . The glycosylation pattern of the spike protein, which carries N-linked as well as O-linked glycosylation, has recently been the subject of several scientific studies (Shajahan et al. 2020; Watanabe et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020 ). Insight into the glycosylation pattern expands the understanding of the viral binding to receptors, the fusion event, the host cell entry, the replication as well as the design of suitable antigens for vaccine development. Our recent study on the site-specific quantitation of N-linked and O-linked glycosylation of the subunits S1 and S2 of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein revealed the presence of one confirmed and one putative O-glycosylation sites at the RBD of subunit S1 (Shajahan et al. 2020) . A number of amino acids within the RBD have been shown to be crucial determinants for the binding in general and the binding affinity in particular of the virus to the host cell receptors Andersen et al. 2020) . Several studies have identified the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2, ACEH) as the key virus receptor of SARS-CoV-1 in the early 2000s (Li et al. 2003; Kuba et al. 2005) . Moreover, hACE2 was identified recently as the receptor for cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 (Hoffmann et al. 2020; Zhou et al. 2020) . However, the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 pathogens exploit the hACE2 receptor for cell entry only, which is unrelated to its physiological function (Li 2013) .",

This protease is a type-I transmembrane protein and includes an extracellular, a transmembrane and a cytosolic domain within a total of 805 amino acids (Jiang et al. 2014 ). Interestingly, is has been found that the transmembrane form can be cleaved to a soluble form of hACE2 (sACE2) that lacks the transmembrane and cytosolic domains but is enzymatically active, since the catalytic site as well as the zinc-binding motif lie within the extracellular region (Tipnis et al. 2000) . hACE2 is secreted by endothelial cells and is involved in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) (Donoghue et al. 2000) .",

Thr496 was shown to contain only a single HexNAc modification as the spectra showed characteristic oxonium ions (204.09) and neutral losses ( Figure S9 ). Since a single HexNAc modification can come from Tn antigen (GalNAc) or O-GlcNAc modification we could not currently assign the type of monosaccharide occupied at this site, and further experiments will be needed to confirm the identity of this HexNAc. Nevertheless, only 0.4 % of this site was found occupied. Considering that the peptide IVGVVEPVPHDETY does not have any N-glycosylation consensus site and that the O-GlcNAc modification does not typically occur with N-or mucin type O-glycosylation, it is likely that this site is occupied by the Tn antigen (GalNAc).",

The RBD located in the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 S protein undergoes a hinge-like dynamic movement which enhances the capture of the spike protein RBD with hACE2. This enhanced affinity for the human ACE2 receptor is predicted to be 10-20-fold higher for SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV-1, which may be responsible for the increased transmissibility of the new virus Yan et al. 2020) .

            "text": "ACE2 is expressed in most vertebrates. The ACE2 variants from human, bat, domestic pig, domestic cat and mouse are all comprises of 805 amino acid residues ( Figure 5) . A comparison of their ACE2 sequences reveals a sequence identity of about 67 %. SARS-CoV-1, as well as SARS-CoV-2 can infect a wide variety of organisms, including but not limited to humans, palm civets, cats and bats. In vitro virus infectivity studies conducted by Zhou et al. (2020) indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is able to exploit the ACE2 proteins from humans, bats, pigs and civets to infect the cell cultures expressing the respective receptor. However, cell culture expressing murine ACE2 was not infected. This is based on a varying degree of receptor recognition. Receptor recognition is largely determined by two factors, (i) the binding specificity and (ii) the binding affinity of the RBD of the virus' spike protein to the cell entry receptor ACE2. This attachment step has been identified as a crucial limiting step for infection, as well as cross-species infection. Two regions within the amino acid sequence of hACE2 have been identified as critical for the interaction with the spike protein. These regions -called 'hotspots' -are located around amino acid residue 31 (hotspot 31) and residue 353 (hotspot 353) (Hou et al. 2010; Li 2013 ). Our comparison of N-glycosylation sites across species indicated that human ACE share some glycosylation site with other species. The study of correlation of glycosylation sites between the species and their susceptibility to viral binding can help in understanding the key sites involved ( Figure 5 ). According to the data published by Qiu et al. (2020) , the overall sequence identity of the ACE2 between different organisms and the hACE2 cannot be directly translated into prediction of transmissibility. For example, mouse ACE2 matches with a higher sequence similarity than bat and pig, but the murine ACE2 cannot be exploited by the coronavirus, the study found (Qiu et al. 2020) .",

Therefore, mutations at either N90 or T92 removes the glycosylation motif and makes the unglycosylated variant prone to interactions with SARS-CoV-2. Also, the elucidation of the structure of murine ACE2 would be beneficial for the investigation of insusceptible organisms.

O-glycans are involved in protein stability and function, and have been suggested to play roles in mediating pathogenic binding with human receptors (Mayr et al. 2018 ). Our analysis confirmed the presence of O-glycosylation at sites Ser155, Thr496 and Thr730 (Figure 2, 3, 4, and 7D ). The frequency of occurrence of proline residues is higher adjacent to O-glycosylation sites (Thanka Christlet and S glycoproteins of coronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and Bat CoV mediates attachment to oligosaccharide receptors by interacting with 9-O-acetyl-sialic acid . No sialic acid binding preference of SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 has been reported and whether the sialic acid linkages on the hACE2 receptor affect virus entry remains to be determined. We have searched for 9-O-acetyl-sialic acid on the hACE2 glycans by extracting the masses of its oxonium ions on the LC-MS/MS spectra but could not detect any evidence for its presence. The expression of 9-O-acetyl-sialic acid depends on the expression level of the sialate O-acetyltransferase gene (CasD1), and only 1 to 2 % of total sialic acid is 9-O-acetylated in HEK93 cells (Barnard et al. 2019 ). This could be the reason for the lack of 9-O-acetyl-sialic acid on the glycans from hACE2 we used for this study as it is produced from HEK293 cells. We have detected both core fucosylation and antennal fucosylation on hACE2 N-glycans ( Figure 7A ). Moreover, we found evidence of bisecting GlcNAc on the hACE2 N-glycans ( Figure 7C ). The implication of such glycan epitopes of hACE2 provide a better understanding of viral binding preferences and can guide the research for the development of suitable therapeutics.",

The reduced (DTT), alkylated (IAA) hACE2 were treated separately with proteases (trypsin and chymotrypsin) for glycopeptide analysis and PNGase F for N-glycan release. Subsequently, the protease digests were analyzed by nLC-NSI-MS/MS, and the released N-glycans were analyzed by MALDI-MS and ESI-MS n after permethylation. The de-N-glycosylated protein fraction was subjected to \u03b2-elimination for the O-glycan release and the released O-glycans were also analyzed by MALDI-MS and ESI-MS n after permethylation (created with biorender.com).",

The evidence for the O-glycosylation assignments at each of the detected sites on hACE2, particularly Thr730, was strengthened by the presence of proline adjacent to the Oglycosylation residues. Human and avian virus Hemagglutinins (HAs), including 2009 pandemic H1N1, were shown to bind glycans with sulfation, fucosylation and internal sialylation. It has been reported that the human pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses shift the preference from \u03b12\u21926-linkages in sialylated Gal\u03b2(1,4)Glc/GlcNAc O-glycans to \u03b12\u21923-linkages in sialylated Gal\u03b2(1,3)GalNAc (Chandrasekaran et al. 2008). The sialylated core 1 glycoforms are involved in the life cycle of influenza A virus and plays crucial role during infection (Mayr et al. 2018). The full-length S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 share almost 76% identity in amino acid sequences, whereas the N-terminal domains (NTDs) show only 53.5% of homology. The NTDs of different coronavirus S proteins bind with varying avidity to different sugars, the NTD of MERS-CoV prefers \u03b12\u21923-linked sialic acid over \u03b12\u21926-linked sialic acid with sulfated sialyl-Lewis X (with antennal fucose) being the preferred binder (Park et al. 2019; Li et al. 2017). Nevertheless, we observed relatively higher level of 2\u21923 linked sialylated N-glycans on hACE2 and thus the sialic acid linkage could favor the binding of coronavirus S proteins (Figure 7B).",

No. 164568, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) of 15 cm length with 75 \u00b5m internal diameter (id), filled with 3 \u00b5m C18 material (reverse phase) were used for chromatographic separation of samples. The precursor ion scan was acquired at 120,000 resolution in the Orbitrap analyzer and precursors at a time frame of 3 s were selected for subsequent MS/MS fragmentation in the Orbitrap analyzer at 15,000 resolution. The LC-MS/MS runs of each digest were conducted for 180 min in order to separate the glycopeptides. The threshold for triggering an MS/MS event was set to 1000 counts, and monoisotopic precursor selection was enabled. MS/MS fragmentation was conducted with stepped HCD (Higher-energy Collisional Dissociation) product triggered CID (Collision-Induced Dissociation) (HCDpdCID)program. Charge state screening was enabled, and precursors with unknown charge state or a charge state of +1 were excluded (positive ion mode). Dynamic exclusion was also enabled (exclusion duration of 30 secs).",
