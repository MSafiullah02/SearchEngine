Vaccines that prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and therapeutics that reduces the risk of severe Covid-19 are thus urgently needed. A rapid method to derive antiviral treatment for Covid-19 is the use of convalescent plasma derived hyperimmune globulin. However, both hyperimmune globulin and vaccine development face a common hurdle -the risk of antibody-mediated disease enhancement.

Substantial proportion of cases progress to severe disease, where approximately 5% of patients require intensive care support and over 20% of critical cases succumb to the disease 2 . While overall mortality rate is likely to be lower than the current estimates, as the prevalence of mildly symptomatic cases has yet to be clearly defined, Covid-19 nonetheless represents a global health emergency. There are no licensed vaccines or proven antiviral therapy to protect or treat against Covid-19. Hence once infected, case management is entirely supportive care 2 .

Such approaches have been explored for patients with viral pneumonia, including SARS and severe influenza [3] [4] [5] . Results have been mostly positive although many of such therapies have not been formally evaluated through a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Theoretically, high titers of neutralizing antibody could reduce viral dissemination from infected to uninfected cells in the respiratory tract. When given soon after illness onset, this therapy could thus not only prevent disease progression, it could also lead to more rapid viral clearance and hence patient de-isolation.

For CoVs, it has been shown that antibodies can bind the surface spike protein exposing the virus to proteolytic activation and Fc receptormediated entry 20 . However, in vitro observations need to be interpreted with caution, since few diseases have been clinically associated with ADE. The most prominent disease associated with ADE is arguably dengue, where infection with one serotype of dengue virus (DENV) predisposes a person to a more severe disease upon secondary infection with a heterologous DENV serotype 23, 24 . A similar phenomenon was responsible for increased hospitalization rates following vaccination of dengue-na\u00efve individuals with the chimeric tetravalent yellow fever-dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia\u00ae 25 . Besides dengue, several other viruses have shown clinical or epidemiological evidence to support the notion of ADE. Two notable examples of vaccine-induced ADE are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [26] [27] [28] [29] and atypical measles 30,31 , where severe disease was more prevalent following vaccination with inactivated virions. Unlike the above-mentioned viral diseases, there is neither clinical nor epidemiological evidence in humans to suggest ADE of CoV infection in severe disease.

This process facilitates virus entry into Fc receptor-expressing monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. However, binding to activating Fc receptors alone is insufficient for ADE. This is because activating Fc receptors trigger signaling molecules that also induce interferon (IFN) stimulated gene (ISG) expression, independent of type-I IFN 33 . ISGs have potent antiviral activities. Consequently, for ADE to occur, viruses must evolve ways to repress such antiviral responses in target cells. For instance, ADE of DENV infection is also dependent on binding of DENV to a co-receptor, the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B1 (LILRB1) 34 . Signaling from LILRB1 inhibits the pathway that induces ISG expression to create an intracellular environment favorable for viral replication 34-36 . Moreover, we have recently reported that DENV has, in addition to binding LILRB1, also evolved other ways to fundamentally alter the host cell response during antibody-mediated infection, to favor viral replication 37 . Consequently, viruses that exploit ADE must (1) target Fc receptor-expressing cells for infection and (2) have evolved mechanisms to overcome the activating Fc receptor triggered antiviral and other responses in myeloid-derived cells 23 . For viruses to evolve such abilities, Fc receptor-expressing cells must be their primary target so that positive selection can take place. However, currently SARS-CoV-2 has thus far been found to infect angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)expressing epithelial cells 38 .
