Passive surveillance is the traditional form of public health monitoring, and it relies on reporting of diseases by health care providers and laboratories to local or state health departments. Active surveillance entails active case finding by health department staff, with regular telephone or on-site visits to obtain information on new cases of notifiable diseases [3].",

Syndromic surveillance refers to the real-time monitoring of clinical syndromes, rather than specific disease etiologies [3]. This approach has received attention as a potentially rapid, economical, and flexible supplement to ongoing traditional surveillance activity [7]. Syndromic surveillance is now used as a part of routine public health monitoring in many local and state health departments [8]. This activity has proven value for monitoring citywide and regional trends of community-wide illness, such as influenza [9], but its ability to detect clusters of illness is less clear.",

Hospital-based drills are one way to test these systems based on emergency department visit or hospital admission data and are capable of identifying both logistic shortcomings and limitations in the outbreak detection algorithms used to detect clusters. Next to actual events, these simulations are probably the most realistic way of evaluating this monitoring. Unlike computer models or simulations [10], [11], drills challenge the communication chain from the moment a patient enters the health care system until an alert is relayed back to that and other facilities regarding the cluster of cases. Finally, drills can be conducted in a nearly blind fashion, with only the health care workers at individual facilities aware that artificial cases are being transmitted for analysis.",

Initially, a triage nurse handwrote each patient's chief complaint on a document that became part of the medical record. Later, at the time of disposition, a clerk transferred the handwritten information into the hospital's electronic registration database. Chief complaint and demographic information was extracted from the hospital information system and transmitted to the NYC-DOHMH twice daily via the Public Health Information Network Messaging System, software promulgated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the secure transmission of patient information [12]. The drill was observed by the NYC-DOHMH, New York City Mayor's Office of Emergency Management, New York Emergency Management Services, the Greater New York Hospital Association, and the New York Health and Hospitals Corporation.

Despite using what was thought to be a sufficient number of drill patients in the respiratory and fever syndrome group, our exercise did not generate an investigation signal at the NYC-DOHMH. Retrospective review of the data from that day suggests that the drill cases were diluted by the high baseline level of fever and respiratory visits at the 3 hospitals. In addition, despite explicit scripts and rules of conduct, the chief complaints of 6 patients (20%) did not result in assignment to the targeted syndrome group. The 6 SARS patients were misclassified in 3 categories: other (n = 3), sepsis (n = 2), and cold (n = 1). For 5 of the 6, misclassification was the result of incomplete information in the electronic chief complaint. That is, information collected by the triage nurse would have resulted in assignment to the appropriate syndromic group, but incomplete data entry by clerical staff resulted in misclassification. For 1 of the 6, misclassification occurred when the hierarchical syndrome coding algorithm used by the NYC-DOHMH classified \u201crunny nose\u201d into the cold syndrome category, despite the presence of text strings \u201ccough\u201d and \u201cfever\u201d in the chief complaint.

The median age of mock patients in the drill was 17 years. The NYC-DOHMH uses 2 age groups: less than 13 and 13 and older. For this reason, many of the younger drill patients were included in the adult age group. If alternative or multiple age groups were used, it is possible that our exercise would have generated a signal. However, much like changing the threshold for cluster detection, this could also have the effect of increasing the number of signals that would need to be investigated. Continued research is needed to optimize the detection algorithms for identifying clusters that may represent a disease outbreak [14].",

Hospital staff are necessarily aware of an ongoing exercise on the day of the drill. This awareness could have skewed isolation practices and biased case finding, resulting in different triage documentation for drill patients. Alternatively, it is possible that, in a busy emergency department, the volunteer patients may not have received the same intensity of medical attention as their real counterparts, as they did not appear to be ill and were not able to realistically simulate sick patients. For this reason, the drill could have underestimated the capacity of the emergency departments to correctly record clinical symptoms in the triage log and registration system. Both of these factors may contribute to a lack of accuracy in the electronic chief complaints, which could then translate into misclassification of individual cases by the NYC-DOHMH. In addition, drills and simulations do not take account of the notification efforts of individual health care workers. As was the case in our drill, a clear epidemiological link existed between the participants. In a real outbreak, an astute health care worker would hopefully notify the local department of health directly. Furthermore, even if the drill had generated a signal from the NYC-DOHMH, it would not have been recognized until the data were analyzed the next day. Syndromic surveillance is not intended as a replacement for traditional provider-based reporting of unusual disease manifestations or clusters.",

As currently designed and used, however, these systems may not be sensitive enough to detect smaller syndrome clusters. Using information from drills and computer simulations, refinements in these networks may improve them and lead to better detection of distributed and smaller clusters. Notifications from health care workers will always play a major role in the identification of outbreaks, but new detection mechanisms like syndromic surveillance could generate supplementary information streams to augment ongoing public health activities.",
