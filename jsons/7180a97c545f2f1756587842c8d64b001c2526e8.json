The NMR represents an attractive animal model in longevity and cancer research, but there are no NMRspecific antibodies available to study its immune system with respect to age-and cancerrelated questions. Substantial homology of major NMR immune cell markers with those of Guinea pig, human and, to a lesser extent, mouse and rat origin are implicated for the existence of immunological cross-reactivity. We identified 10 antibodies recognising eight immunophenotypic markers expressed on the NMR's T and B lymphocytes, macrophages/monocytes and putative haematopoietic precursors and used them for an immunophenotyping of leukocyte subsets of peripheral blood, spleen and bone marrow samples. Overall, we found that the leukocyte composition of NMR peripheral blood is comparable to that of mice. Notably, the frequency of cytotoxic T cells was found to be lower in the NMR compared to corresponding mouse tissues and human blood. Antibodies used in the present paper are available either commercially or from the scientific community and will provide new opportunities for the NMR as a model system in ageingand cancer-related research areas.",

To verify specificity of antibody staining, positively and negatively stained cell populations were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and analysed by Q-RT-PCR for the expression of the surface molecule of interest (an example is shown in Supporting Information Fig. 3 ). Through this approach, we were able to identify five additional antibody clones recognising surface IgM, MHC class II (MHC-II) antigens (two clones), the chemokine receptor CXCR3 and the proto-oncogene c-Kit/CD117 (Table 1 ). Finally, specificity of these five antibodies was confirmed by sequencing the appropriate Q-RT-PCR products. In total, we screened 96 monoclonal antibodies against 38 Guinea pig, human and mouse immune cell markers (Supporting Information Table 2 ) and came up with 10 antibodies, recognising eight NMR antigens ( Table 1) .",

Notably, the relative number of CD3\u03b5 + CD8\u03b1 + cells was surprisingly low in all tested NMR tissues (Fig. 1E , Supporting Information Fig. 8 ), and the nature of CD3\u03b5 + CD8\u03b1 \u2212 cells still has to be identified. Since CD3\u03b5 and CD8\u03b1 can also be expressed by other cells such as \u03b3\u03b4T, natural killers (NK), dendritic (DC) and innate lymphoid (ILC) cells, additional markers are required for a fine analysis of CD3expressing cell subsets. However, it was recently shown that the NK cells and NK-related MHC-I receptors are absent in the NMR [9] .",
