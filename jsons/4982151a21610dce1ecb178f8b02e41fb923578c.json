However, we were unable to find information regarding the prevalence of this coronavirus in children with brainbased developmental disabilities. We did not identify any study investigating the effects of COVID-19 in children with brain-based disabilities but did identify four studies discussing the coronavirus disease in children considered at risk for disability (preterm infants or children with some pre-existing medical conditions). Although some of the children in the included studies did develop complications, symptoms were reported as being partially or significantly alleviated or resolved, with most patients being discharged from the hospital and no deaths being reported.",

Indeed, it appears as though this specific population has been overlooked. The lack of data could be due to the low occurrence rates as well as the milder symptoms which have previously been reported in children (11, 12, 22) . In addition, it is possible that due to their milder or absent symptoms, these cases simply do not get reported. However, clinical guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) clearly state that individuals of any age with underlying conditions, including congenital heart disease, may be at higher risk of developing moderate to severe symptoms from COVID-19 (23) . Moreover, UNICEF warns that children with underlying disabilities may be at greater risk of developing complications (24) . More data, including the presence of brainbased disabilities and other at-risk conditions in children, are required to have a better understanding of the clinical impacts of COVID-19 on these potentially more vulnerable populations. With that goal in mind, one ongoing review is currently examining comorbidities in the adult and pediatric populations (25) .",
