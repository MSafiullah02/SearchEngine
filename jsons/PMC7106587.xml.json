In 1941, the first operation for esophageal atresia was completed by Haight and Towsplet [5], and since then, conventional open surgery has been developed and widely recognized. The traditional operation is safe and effective, but it has some shortcomings, including substantial trauma, bleeding, slow postoperative recovery, postoperative thoracic deformity, and intercostal nerve injury [6, 7]. With the maturity and progress of surgical technology and the development of surgical instruments, as well as requirements among patients for an aesthetically pleasing surgical incision and early recovery after the operation, minimally invasive surgery is becoming increasingly popular in various fields. After more than 10 years of exploration and practice, thoracoscopic esophageal atresia has been widely carried out worldwide [6, 8\u201313]. In this study, the clinical data for patients with type III esophageal atresia in our hospital were analyzed retrospectively to summarize the clinical experience and evaluate the safety and effectiveness of thoracoscopic surgery.",

However, the traditional surgery has many disadvantages, such as a long incision and considerable injury to the chest wall, and chest wall deformity of the high shoulder blade, chest wall asymmetry, rib fusion, scoliosis and chest muscle dysplasia can easily occur. In contrast, thoracoscopic surgery only requires three 5-mm holes on the chest wall to complete the operation, and the incision is very small; thus, the injury to the chest wall, intercostal muscles and nerves is minimal, which can significantly reduce the incidence of chest wall deformity and surgical scarring. The data from our study showed that the incidence of chest wall deformity and the length of incision in thoracoscopic surgery were significantly lower than in those who underwent the traditional open surgery (P < 0.05). The results was similar to the findings of Suzuki M [14], Bastard F [15] and Lawal TA [16]. Their findings also suggest that thoracoscopic surgery has a smaller scarring and smaller incidence of chest wall deformities.",

Therefore, bleeding of the surgical wound is obviously reduced, as is that of the wound after the operation, and the blood products to be infused during and after the operation can also be reduced. In this study, the thoracic drainage volume and transfusion volume were 62.7 \u00b1 25.5 ml and 30.5 \u00b1 10.4 ml in group A, respectively, which were significantly lower than those in group B (125.4 \u00b1 46.1 ml and 55.3 \u00b1 22.7 ml), with a significant difference between the groups (P < 0.05). Thoracoscopic surgery reduces the risk of blood transfusion and the cost of treatment. Moreover, the distal esophagus can be clearly distinguished by moving the thoracoscopic lens, which can dissociate a longer esophageal, up to 2 cm above the thoracic entrance and downward to the esophageal foramen. The tension of the anastomotic orifice was reduced, and the difficulty of anastomotic anastomosis and the incidence of anastomotic leakage were also reduced [17]. At the same time, assistants, anesthesiologists and nurses have the same view as the surgeon, which can be conducive to surgical cooperation and communication.",

In addition to the impact of surgical trauma, surgical pain, intraoperative and postoperative bleeding, and blood transfusion, postoperative pulmonary infection is easily aggravated. Pulmonary infection is an important factor affecting the prognosis of children with esophageal atresia [18, 19]. Thoracoscopic surgery has the advantages of reduced trauma, bleeding and blood transfusion, and it can better maintain the integrity of the chest. Moreover, it can greatly reduce postoperative pain, help children cough and recover lung function after the operation, and speed the recovery of overall body function after the operation, which allows children to come off the ventilator early and promotes the absorption of pulmonary inflammation.

The feel of the space with thoracoscopic surgery is different from that of the traditional surgery, and the operator must overcome the inertia of the traditional surgery operation to facilitate the operation. In newborns, the volume of the chest cavity is small, and the visual field and operation space of thoracoscopy are also small, such that the \u201cchopstick effect\u201d of the eyepiece and separation forceps easily appears in the narrow space [20]. Therefore, the difficulty of congenital esophageal atresia surgery via thoracoscopy is large, and the learning curve is steep. The studies showed that the study curve of esophageal atresia was 20\u201340 cases [21, 22]. However, the safety and effectiveness of the thoracoscopic operation gradually improve with the development of the thoracoscopic technique and improvement in the technique of the surgeon. Thoracoscopic surgery has become an effective treatment method for esophageal atresia combined with tracheoesophageal carcinoma [23]. Our center began endoscopic surgery early. At present, there have been more than 100 cases of thoracoscopic and laparoscopic surgeries, which have contributed to the skillful completion of all types of thoracoscopic surgery in children. In our study, the operating time for the thoracoscopic group was similar to that for the conventional operation group (P > 0.05). In general, a detailed assessment of the condition of the child should be performed before the operation to be fully prepared. Furthermore, a minimal operation should be carried out, and good communication with the anesthesiologist should be ensured to provide a high-quality thoracoscopic operation.",
