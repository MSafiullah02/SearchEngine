Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for approximately 70% of all infections. In addition, HIV-1 represent one of the most fast-evolving pathogens known to science. This has led to the classification of HIV-1 into subtypes, sub-subtypes and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs). Of relevance, previous reports have suggested that the genetic composition of the infecting HIV-1 strain may influence transmission, disease progression, virus-host interactions, antiretroviral treatment responses, and vaccine development3\u201312. Moreover, it has been suggested that targeted HIV-1 prevention may be a cost-effective way to decrease the number of new HIV-1 infections \u2013 not least in low-and-middle-income countries13. Planning of such HIV-1 intervention programs will require detailed information about both the characteristics and sources of new infections.",

            "text": "Nigeria is the most populous country in Sub-Saharan Africa, has the second highest number of HIV-1 infected persons in the world, and the highest number of annual AIDS-related deaths14,15. HIV-1 serological surveys in Nigeria were initiated in 1991, at which time the adult prevalence was 1.8% (760000 people)16. This figure increased to 5.8% by 2001 (2.6 million), before declining to 2.8% in 2017 (3.1 million)2,16. Previous reports have identified subtype G and the CRF02_AG as the most common HIV-1 variants in Nigeria17\u201320. In addition, the CRF43_02G was recently shown to be highly prevalent in the capital Abuja21. However, the estimates of each strain\u2019s contribution to the Nigerian HIV-1 epidemic have varied considerably, with frequency estimates ranging from 22\u201350% for subtype G, and 19\u201360% for the CRF02_AG18\u201325. These variations could have several reasons, such as differences between geographic areas, transmission groups, or employed subtyping tools26,27. Hence, a clearer picture of the HIV-1 subtype/CRF distributions and spread in Nigeria is needed. The objective of the current study was therefore to perform the first nationwide analysis of the molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 in Nigeria.",

The remaining 119 URFs consisted of different combinations of various HIV-1 strains less common in Nigeria. We therefore performed a detailed recombination analysis on the 209 URFs consisting of CRF02_AG, CRF43_02G, and subtype G. One-hundred of the 209 URF sequences (48%) were from Abuja; 45 from Lagos (22%); 35 from Jos (17%); 10 from Maiduguri (5%); 9 from Kaduna (4%); seven from Ibadan (3%); and two from Adamawa (1%); and one from Enugu (<1%). These sequences were initially selected from the maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees if they branched off close to the root between two subtypes and had long branches. There were 655 breakpoint positions recorded among the 209 sequences, with some sequences having more than one breakpoint. These positions were plotted as a frequency plot of breakpoints along the alignment to identify hotspots for recombination (i.e. positions in the alignment were recombination breakpoints occur more frequently than the other positions, Supplementary Fig. S2). Alignment positions around 285\u2013315 (HXB2 K03455 positions: 2538\u20132568), 503\u2013534 (2756\u20132787), 720\u2013775 (2973\u20133028) and 923\u2013956 (3176\u20133209) were identified as potential recombination hotspots. To define these positions more precisely, we used the inter-quartile range (IQR) of the optimal univariate K-median clustering algorithm with the number of clusters determined by the gap-statistic method (Supplementary Fig. S3)58: Recombination hotspot I: 294\u2013312 (HXB2 K03455 positions: 2547\u20132565); II: 503\u2013533 (2756\u20132786); III: 729\u2013805 (2982\u20133058); and IV: 931\u2013957 (3184\u20133210) (Supplementary Table S1). Of the 209 sequences, 139 (67%) had a recombination breakpoint in the hotspot I region; 104 (50%) in hotspot II region; 58 (28%) in hotspot III region; and 59 (28%) in hotspot IV region. The hotspot positions were unique independent recombination events from the original breakpoint positions as previously identified for the parental sequences of CRF43_02G (HXB2 K03455 positions: 1266, 3325, and 6097) and CRF02_AG (HXB2 K03455 positions: 2391, 3275, and 4175). We identified 37 URFs that could be divided into seven groups sharing breakpoint positions (each group consisting of 3\u201310 sequences, respectively, and thereby fulfilling the requirements as potentially novel CRFs; Supplementary Table S2).

Using the exponential growth model, the median growth rate was 0.3 per year (95%HPD: 0.18\u20130.42). The three clusters representing the CRF02_AG epidemic displayed a similar pattern with a slow increase in growth rate from the 1980s to 2000s.

To the best of our knowledge, only one previous nationwide molecular epidemiology study from Nigeria have been presented60. In this study, 55 HIV-1 gp41 sequences (approximately 400 bp) collected throughout Nigeria during 1999 were analysed by neighbour-joining phylogenetics. However, the analysis was unable to distinguish between subtype A and CRF02_AG sequences \u2013 likely due to insufficient phylogenetic information in this relatively short gene fragment, as suggested by the authors. In-depth phylogenetic and phylodynamic analysis was therefore not possible in this study. In comparison, we analysed 1442 HIV-1 pol sequences (approximately 1000 bp long) collected throughout Nigeria between 1999 and 2013 using maximum-likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetics. Importantly, the HIV-1 pol gene (which is the most targeted genetic region for HIV-1 sequencing and by far most commonly analysed region in studies of HIV-1 molecular epidemiology) holds sufficient intrinsic genetic variability to permit the reconstruction of transmission histories by phylogenetic approaches26,32,61. Hence, the larger size of our dataset, the relatively long time-window of sampling, and the use of state-of-the-art phylodynamic methods enabled us to perform the first in-depth nationwide HIV-1 phylodynamic study in Nigeria. In line with other previous studies from different geographic regions in Nigeria, we found that CRF02_AG, CRF43_02G and subtype G were the most prevalent strains (previous estimates ranging from 19\u201360% for CRF02_AG and 22\u201350% for subtype G18\u201325,62). The prevalence of CRF43_02G has only been reported in one previous study from Abuja (estimated to 19%)21. Non-representative sampling or local fluctuations between geographic regions in Nigeria could explain the large variations and discrepancies between studies. It could also be explained, in part, by the use of different subtyping tools between studies (which can differ in accuracy in assigning the correct subtype/CRF based on partial genome sequences)27.",

Each of these clusters harbored the majority of Nigerian sequences, suggesting single strain introductions that grew out to dominate the Nigerian HIV-1 epidemic. Previous studies have used different nomenclatures of subtype G. A comparison of accession numbers showed that our subtype G cluster is partly consistent with the subtype G\u2019 cluster identified by Chaplin et al.22. Further dissection of the subtype G\u2019 cluster showed that approximately half of the sequences belonged to subtype G, whereas the other half clustered with the CRF43_02G sequences in our analysis. In a more recent study, Delatorre et al. suggested a nomenclature based on geographic dissemination63. The clustering pattern of the West African strain defined as subtype GWA-II was largely overlapping with the Nigerian subtype G cluster in our analysis63. We estimated the date of origin for the subtype G cluster to 1975 (95%HPD: 1969\u20131982), which is consistent with the origin of the subtype GWA-II cluster that was estimated to 1979 [95%HPD: 1973\u20131984])63. In addition, the estimated date of origin also fits with the fact that the first AIDS cases were identified in Nigeria in 1986, approximately one decade after the introduction of this virus strain16. The CRF43_02G was first described and isolated in Saudi Arabia in 200864. Interestingly, the GWA-I cluster determined by Delatorre et al. consisted of 140/168 (83%) sequences from Nigeria63. In our analysis, more than half of the GWA-I sequences clustered with the CRF43_02G strain. Spatiotemporal analysis of the GWA-I cluster indicated that this strain emerged in Nigeria in the mid-1970\u2019s63. This is consistent with our estimate of 1971 (95%HPD: 1952\u20131983) for the CRF43_02G cluster. Moreover, the majority of CRF43_02G sequences in Genbank are of Nigerian origin (www.hiv.lanl.gov), and both the putative parental strains of CRF43_02G in Nigeria (CRF02_AG and subtype G) are highly prevalent. Altogether, this suggests that CRF43_02G originated in central West Africa, in or close to Nigeria.",

However, the CRF02_AG strain is the most prevalent strain in West Africa, and a previous study of the West Central African CRF02_AG epidemic estimated that this strain originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in 1973 (95%HPD: 1972\u20131975)65. This is in line with a previous study by Abecasis et al. that estimated the CRF02_AG date of origin to 1976 (95%HPD: 1971\u20131981)66. However, a more detailed analysis of the CRF02_AG strain by Mir et al. indicated that seven subvariants of CRF02_AG are circulating (as determined by a combination of phylogenetics and geographic dissemination)67. The seven subvariants of CRF02_AG were estimated to have originated between 1967 and 2003 (combined 95%HPD: 1961\u20132005). More specifically, the analysis indicated that the oldest strain was the West African CRF02_AG strain (introduced 1967 [95%HPD: 1961\u20131974]). The three CRF02_AG clusters identified in the current study were estimated to have originated between 1963 and 1970 (combined 95%HPD: 1948\u20131980). Although the 95%HPD intervals are overlapping with the estimates suggesting the origin to be the DRC, they are on the lower side. Moreover, the CRF02_AG strain was first isolated in Nigeria in 199668. Due to the somewhat conflicting data presented above, further analysis is needed to provide solid evidence of the geographical origin of the CRF02_AG strain.",

This increase was followed by a decline in number of effective infections that coincided with the introduction of free ART in Nigeria in 2006, which resulted in a decrease in HIV-1 prevalence from 6% to 3% in Nigeria the following years2,16. Moreover, our analysis suggested that urban areas like Abuja and Lagos were the major hubs of HIV-1 transmission in Nigeria. This is in line with previous reports from West Africa69. However, it should be noted that the majority of the sequences were collected in Abuja, and potential transmissions from other cities may therefore not have been captured in our analysis.",

This hotspot has previously been reported in a study on HIV-1 subtype B72. The hotspot positions II and IV have also been reported previously73. To date, eighteen distinct subtype G-related CRFs have been described (www.hiv.lanl.gov). We identified seven groups of URFs with similar recombination breakpoint patterns.
