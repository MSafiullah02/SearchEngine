Phosphoprotein (P) is known to play pivotal roles in the life cycle of RABV, and has been regarded as a prime target for inhibitors of viral replication. This study aimed to carry out intracellular administration of a kind of P-binding peptide for RABV inhibition. A group of reported P-binding peptides were focused on for activity improvement by quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) method, and then were mediated by cell penetrating peptide (CPP) for intracellular activity evaluation. The QSAR models had good performance in reliability and predictability (R 2 \u2265 0.852, Q 2 \u2265 0.601, Q 2 ext \u2265 0.595), and the peptide screened by partial least squares (PLS) QSAR model (R 2 = 0.994, Q 2 = 0.937, Q 2 ext = 0.981) exhibited even higher antiviral activity when it was delivered into the cells by CPP. Above all, this study provided an effective way for development of peptide drug against RABV.",

However, owing to the cost, accessibility and complexity of treatment, PEP usually can't be given promptly and correctly, rabies still has a high death rate (Jackson 2016; Kaur et al. 2015; Lama et al. 2019; Zhu and Guo 2016) . Antiviral therapy is thought to be an important component of combination therapy for the management of human rabies, especially for patients who have missed the deadline for valid vaccination or have developed clinical symptoms . Till now, no effective therapy can prevent the virus from invading the central nervous system (CNS) once it successfully replicate intracellularly (Banyard et al. 2017; Gnanadurai et al. 2015; Zhu and Guo 2016) .

In this work, the CPP 'RRR RRR RRR' was effective in transferring the inhibitory peptides into cells. Figure 3 showed that at low concentrations the antiviral effect of the two peptides had no obvious difference, while at high concentrations P16b6 was more active than P16, and better antiviral effect depended on higher dosages of peptides, which indicated the inhibitory activity was related not only to the binding force, but also to the amount of peptide in the cell. High concentration might lead to side-effects, such as hemolysis (data not shown), to further improve the activity of the peptide and at the same time to decrease the side-effects should be considered in the future study. Another way to utilize these peptides is to express them in the host cells, provided that a safe and efficient delivery system is available.
