This 294 study is a baseline assessment from which future analyses using updated data can be based. A 295 limitation of this study is our use of the maximum potential capacity of each penitentiary as the 296 population denominator for rate calculations, rather than the 'true' population at the time of data 297 collection. We expect that these denominators are likely too large, given that prisons may not be 298 at their full capacity and pressures to release non-violent offenders to reduce the number of 299 susceptible individuals within prisons [17] . This may have led to the under-estimation of testing 300 and infection prevalence estimates. Further, this study was not able to also count the number of 301 tests and cases identified within custodial and health staff within these same penitentiaries, which 302 is an important contributing factor to disease transmission. While other deaths in federal 303 penitentiaries were recorded by CSC during the study period (e.g. [18] ), only one case was 304 reported as COVID-19 related. It is unclear whether other deaths occurring within CSC facilities 305 have or will be tested for COVID-19 post-mortem. Lastly, these findings may not be 306 generalizable to provincial, remand, or immigration detention facilities, which may see far more 307 movement in and out given the shorter duration of sentences. 308 Our findings of sparse testing across several penitentiaries in Canada suggests that a more 321 proactive testing approach may be needed to help curb potential future outbreaks. This is 322 especially the case given studies suggesting that up to 60% of COVID-19 cases may be 323 asymptomatic [21] [22] [23] . Testing based on symptom-presence alone may thus need to be 324 .

Twelve of the 50 facilities studied-nearly one in five (24%)-had 175 recorded a complete absence of testing (indicated by hollow bars in Figure 1). Approximately 176 72% of all facilities (36/50) recorded fewer tests than the Canadian general population average of 177 16 tests per 1000 population. Facilities with higher levels of testing per 1000 population, tended 178 to be those that had already reported a higher COVID-19 prevalence (Figure 1). 179 180 On average across provinces, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan have 181 been testing less inside prisons than in the general population (Figure 2). The opposite is true for 182 Quebec, Ontario, and British Columbia, which were likely responsible for driving the average of 183 34 tests per 1000 population observed for the prison population, overall. 184 185 3.2 Prevalence of COVID-19 inside versus outside federal prisons 186 187 The high positive test rates and estimated prevalence of COVID-19 in prisons in Quebec and 188 British Columbia point to emerging outbreaks in these provinces (Figure 2). Prevalence was 10 189 times higher in Quebec, 6 times higher in British Columbia, and 2 times higher in Ontario within 190 federal prisons compared to the general population of each province (Figure 2). 191 192 Many of the hardest-hit penitentiaries are near major city centers. In Quebec, this was the 193 Federal Training Center complex in Laval, just north of Montreal (51 cases, 7% COVID-19 194 prevalence) and, Joliette Institution for Women in Joliette, a 1-hour drive away from Montreal 195 (51 cases, 39% prevalence). However, Port Cartier Institution in C\u00f4te Nord (a relatively remote 196 region of the province) also reported 15 cases (Figure 1).

The observation that at least five Canadian penitentiaries 313 are experiencing outbreaks highlights the importance that all penitentiary populations and 314 custodial and health care staff uphold rigorous prevention control practices (and be given the 315 resources to do so), including regular hand hygiene and cleaning practices, the use of personal 316 protection equipment, and physical distancing measures [19]. Scholars and legal experts have 317 also emphasized the need to consider the release of prisoners to reduce the proportion of 318 susceptible individuals within prisons [20]. 319 320",

In Canadian penitentiaries, universal testing may be 332 most pertinent in prisons that have already reported confirmed cases. At the time of writing, 333 British Columbia's Mission Institution penitentiarywhere one of the five outbreaks is 334 unfoldinghad reported planning universal testing of all inmates and staff [27]. However, none 335 of the other institutions had indicated plans to use such an approach. 336 337 As an alternative to universal testing, active sentinel surveillance involves identifying a subset of 338 prisons in which regular testing for COVID-19 among prisoners and staff, regardless of symptom 339 presence, could be conducted. Test results would be used for monitoring in the months to come 340 until a vaccine or effective treatment is identified. This approach may be most relevant in 341 provinces with low numbers of new daily COVID-19 cases (e.g. currently New Brunswick, Nova 342 Scotia, Saskatchewan and Manitoba currently) or in later in the pandemic, when community 343 transmission subsides and testing all prisoners may be too costly and inefficient. 344 345 These types of proactive surveillance activities may be particularly important in the context of 346 alternative options to reduce the spread of COVID-19, such as long-term cell-based confinement 347 for the entire prison population. Confinement has been associated with severe mental health risk 348 [28]-particularly for Indigenous and racialized populations [6]-and has come under 349 considerable scrutiny in Canada in recent years [29]. 350 351 Lastly, studies on the effectiveness of universal and sentinel-based testing strategies are 352 warranted, as are mathematical models that explore the epidemiologic consequence of 353 interventions (or lack thereof) within federal prisons on COVID-19 transmission, morbidity and 354 death, as has been done in other country settings [30]. 355",
