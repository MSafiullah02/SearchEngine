Infl ammatory and immunologic mechanisms can also be disrupted by drugs. Cytotoxic drugs, for instance, can reduce neutrophil number and function.

For instance, if a patient presents with severe hypoxemia and diffuse pulmonary infi ltrates, a health care provider who recognizes a prior splenectomy as the major predisposition to infection would focus the diagnostic evaluation and the empiric therapy on Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus infl uenzae. By contrast, if the patient's major predisposition to infection were HIV infection with a CD4+ T lymphocyte count below 50 cells/\u00b5L, the health care provider would focus on Pneumocystis jiroveci and S. pneumoniae; if a cytomegalovirus (CMV)-negative patient's major predisposition were a recent allogeneic stem cell transplant from a CMV-positive donor, then CMV would be a prime consideration. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Immune competence should ideally be measurable by objective laboratory parameters. In fact, the risk for opportunistic infection in patients with HIV infection can be assessed by clinical laboratories with a high degree of accuracy by measuring the number of circulating CD4+ T lymphocytes. 5 The susceptibility of cancer patients to opportunistic bacterial and Candida infections can be assessed by measuring the number of circulating neutrophils. 7, 10, 11 The predisposition of patients with certain congenital immunodefi ciencies can be assessed by measuring serum immunoglobulin levels. 12 Unfortunately, however, for a large number of immunodefi ciencies, no objective laboratory measures have been validated as predicting the risk of infection. Moreover, laboratory measures must be interpreted in context. CD4+ T lymphocyte counts have great prognostic value in patients with HIV infection but not in most other patient populations; neutrophil counts are relevant in all patient populations, but low counts are associated with disrupted mucosal surfaces compared with those with intact mucosa. Thus laboratory parameters must be interpreted in the context of the patient's underlying disease-risk is not always easily manageable by measuring one laboratory parameter.",

Conversely, patients with fever may not have infection: Fever may be a manifestation of the underlying disease, an allergic response to a drug, or an underlying neoplastic or collagen vascular disease. 3. Diagnostic evaluation needs to be prompt and defi nitive. As indicated earlier, patients with life-threatening infection may present with subtle symptoms and signs that progress rapidly: these early manifestations merit aggressive attempts to defi ne the anatomy of the lesion and the causative microbial pathogen. Because the spectrum of potential pathogens includes a wide array of microorganisms (e.g., viruses, fungi, protozoa, or bacteria), clinicians must be certain that appropriate specimens are obtained and the appropriate microbiologic and histologic tests are ordered to identify common, as well as uncommon or unusual, pathogens. Invasive diagnostic techniques such as bronchoalveolar lavage or tissue biopsies should be performed with less hesitancy than in immunologically normal patients. Patients often have enhanced risk factors for invasive procedures, such as thrombocytopenia, coagulation factor defi ciencies, or compromised organ function. However, the benefi t of defi nitive diagnosis often outweighs these risks when the procedures are performed by experienced operators. 4. The threshold for initiating broad-spectrum empiric therapy should be low. Because patients can deteriorate rapidly and because they are susceptible to such a wide array of microbial pathogens, clinicians should have little hesitation in instituting empiric antimicrobial therapy. This therapy must be directed at the full range of bacterial, fungal, viral, protozoal, and helminthic infections to which patients are predisposed. This therapy should be administered promptly, preferably within an hour of suspecting an infectious process. Clinicians should initiate comprehensive regimens: antimicrobial agents can be discontinued or reduced when culture results and clinical events clarify the scenario. 5. Foreign bodies and infectious foci should be addressed.",

Immunocompromised patients often have multiple prior and concurrent insults to their renal and hepatic function, and they often receive multiple drugs that can produce drug-drug interactions. Thus monitoring the pharmacokinetics and assessing potential toxicities are especially important in these patient populations.

The absolute neutrophil count is not the only factor that determines susceptibility, however, because some patients with cyclic neutropenias, druginduced neutropenias, or HIV-induced neutropenias, for example, are not nearly as susceptible to infection as are cancer patients receiving cytotoxic therapy. Other important contributors to susceptibility, in addition to the absolute neutrophil count, are the duration of neutropenia, the functional capability of neutrophils, the integrity of physical barriers such as the skin and gastrointestinal mucosa, the patient's microbiologic environment (endogenous and exogenous fl ora), and the status of other immune mechanisms. For example, a patient with vancomycin-induced neutropenia during therapy for a staphylococcal infection may not develop any complications if the neutropenia is brief and defense mechanisms are otherwise intact. A patient with HIV-induced neutropenia may have prolonged or even lifelong neutrophil counts below 500/\u00b5L yet suffer few serious bacterial complications. 14 The presence of intact physical defense barriers is a major difference compared with cancer patients, whose skin and mucous membranes are disrupted by cytotoxic therapy in which the skin and gastrointestinal tracts are portals of entry for infections that are not controlled by diminished host immunologic or infl ammatory defenses. Thus the patient with HIV infection is usually at a much lower risk for a bacterial infection than is a cancer patient, despite a comparable neutrophil count.",

Anaerobic bacteria and aerobic gram-positive cocci were recognized less commonly. Aerobic gram-negative bacillus infections were also associated with a poorer outcome than infections from gram-positive cocci. Given the spectrum of pathogenic organisms that were seen in that era, combination therapy was usually advocated. 11,16-24 A number of reasons were proposed to justify combination therapy: (1) broad coverage of potential pathogens; (2) prevention of emergence of resistance; and (3) synergy. In general, these principles are reasonable concepts on which to base a preference for using combination therapeutic regimens. However, no study unequivocally demonstrated that combination therapy provided better outcomes than did monotherapy, assuming that both study arms contained drugs that had activity against the causative organism. In addition, predicting synergy proved diffi cult. 25 In the 1990s the spectrum of causative pathogens in neutropenic patients shifted from a predominance of gram-negative bacilli to a majority of gram-positive cocci including streptococci, staphylococci (including oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), and enterococci (including vancomycin-resistant enterocci). 20, 24, 26 The development of potent broad-spectrum \u03b2-lactam and quinolone drugs in the 1980s and 1990s has provided single agents that can probably provide comparable outcomes to combination therapy when used empirically or specifi cally. In the current era the choice of single or combination regimens is based predominantly on the spectrum of organisms that needs to be covered rather than attempting a strategy of trying to obtain more potency through additive or synergistic combinations. 10, 27 Promptly initiating broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy for all cancer patients who are febrile and who are neutropenic (neutrophil count <500/mm 3 ) as a result of cytotoxic chemotherapy is standard practice. 7,10,27 For febrile neutropenic patients who have no apparent source of infection, there is no evidence that the initial antibacterial regimen is any more effective if a broad-spectrum antibacterial regimen consisting of two or more drugs is used instead of a single broad-spectrum antibacterial drug. For stable \"low-risk\" patients outside the ICU, an oral regimen is now considered a reasonable approach. 7, 10, 17 Such oral regimens would not be used for inpatients in most circumstances and would not be appropriate for high-risk or unstable patients. 7, 10 Antifungal and antiviral drugs are generally not used empirically when neutropenic patients are initially treated unless there is a specifi c reason to have a high suspicion for a fungal or viral process.",

Therapy is generally not narrowed in terms of spectrum, however, because alteration of broad-spectrum coverage to focused therapy has been associated with more complications (e.g., \"breakthrough bacteremias\") unless the neutropenia resolves. Whenever fever persists, therapy has generally been continued during the entire course of neutropenia because cessation of antimicrobial therapy has been associated with recurrent bacteremia resulting from the initial causative organism or a newly identifi ed pathogen. A 10-to 14-day course of antibacterial therapy is usually the minimum recommended if a causative infection is identifi ed.

Ceftazidime is an option chosen by some, but its poor activity against gram-positive cocci has caused some clinicians to use other agents. 18 Intensivists must recognize, however, that these monotherapy regimens may not be appropriate in an ICU. Patients in ICUs, by defi nition, are either unstable hemodynamically or have a potentially life-threatening process such as diffuse pneumonia or are \"fragile\" because of concurrent processes. Thus combination regimens are preferred by many authorities in ICU settings, even though no study clearly documents superior outcomes from such combination regimens. The decade that started in 2000 is an era when microbial resistance is becoming an increasingly important problem for many types of bacteria including aerobic grampositive cocci and anaerobes, as well as aerobic gramnegative bacilli. Multiple drug empiric regimens are more likely than monotherapy regimens to include an agent with activity against the offending pathogen(s). Thus in a situation in an ICU when failure to use an active drug is more likely to be lethal than in other settings, and when enhanced potency is a logical goal, combination therapy is prudent as an initial management strategy. Thus adding vancomycin or linezolid or daptomycin for better grampositive coverage, adding a quinolone for better gramnegative bacillus coverage, and adding metronidazole to cefepime would be prudent in this patient population pending results of initial diagnostic studies. Of note, however, is that although this strategy is logical, no study has shown convincingly that such an approach improves outcome. 22 A substantial number of febrile, neutropenic patients fail to improve in terms of fever or other manifestations. Failure to improve may result from poor immune response, a need for drainage or necessity to remove foreign bodies, the use of drugs without activity against the causative organism, or a noninfectious process including drug allergy (i.e., fever resulting from a drug including an antimicrobial agent). The potential causative processes need to be aggressively reassessed on a regular basis by physical examination, history, cultures, and imaging techniques. Most centers add antifungal therapy empirically at day 4 or day 7 of therapy if patients remain febrile. 10, 27, 29, 36, 37 Fluconazole, liposomal amphotericin B, caspofungin, or voriconazole may be used: In some situations fl uconazole would be less attractive either because the patient has received fl uconazole prophylaxis or because molds are suspected. 28, 38, 39 The toxicity profi le of amphotericin B, even in its liposomal form, has led many clinicians to prefer voriconazole or one of the echinocandins (i.e., caspofungin, micafungin, or anidulafungin). 30, 40, 41 After empiric antimicrobial therapy is initiated, the optimal duration of therapy is a complex issue that depends on the type and severity of the infectious process and the duration and severity of immunosuppression, especially the neutropenia. If a causative bacterium is identifi ed, a minimum of 7 to 10 days of therapy is generally advocated, with at least 3 to 4 days being administered after neutropenia has resolved. Longer courses may be required in certain settings. The duration of antifungal therapy is a complex issue and depends on the specifi c mycosis, the location and extent of disease, and the patient's immune status. 15 This is discussed in Chapter 53. The use of combination therapy for fungal diseases remains controversial. 42, 43 A common problem in febrile, neutropenic patients is managing indwelling intravascular lines. [44] [45] [46] In general, these lines can be left in place initially if examination of the site reveals no indication of infection. Blood cultures should be drawn through the catheter. Although some experts advocate drawing a culture through each port of each catheter, obtaining this many blood cultures is often not feasible. If a patient is hemodynamically unstable and fails to respond promptly to fl uid administration, it is prudent to remove the line in case an infected catheter is the source of the sepsis. Failure to remove the foreign body in this situation probably increases the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome. Should blood cultures become positive and should the suspicion be high that the catheter is the source, antibacterial therapy may be successful in some settings (e.g., if the pathogen is a bacteria that is relatively sensitive to antibacterial therapy), thus avoiding the need to remove the catheter. Situations suggesting that catheter removal is necessary include hemodynamic instability despite aggressive fl uid resuscitation, tunnel infection, or infections resulting from fungi or relatively antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as P. aeruginosa.",

            "text": "The most prominent manifestations of HIV continue to be the opportunistic infections and tumors that occur as a consequence of HIV-induced immunosuppression. The CD4+ T lymphocyte cell number is a useful marker for predicting the occurrence of opportunistic infections in patients with HIV infection. 5, 9 This relationship of CD4+ T lymphocyte count to the occurrence of opportunistic infection continues to be as valid in the era of HAART as it was before the licensing of the fi rst antiretroviral agent, zidovudine, in 1987. [60] [61] [62] Figure 54 -2 demonstrates the typical relationship of CD4+ T lymphocyte counts to the occurrence of opportunistic infections. Knowledge of this relationship permits the focusing of diagnostic, therapeutic, and prophylactic management. For instance, if a patient with HIV infection and a CD4+ T lymphocyte count of 700 cells/\u00b5L presents with diffuse pulmonary infi ltrates, the diagnostic evaluation and empiric antimicrobial regimen should focus on S. pneumoniae; H. infl uenzae; Mycoplasma, Legionella, and Chlamydia organisms, as well as common community-acquired viruses. In contrast, if the same patient had a CD4+ T lymphocyte count of 50 cells/\u00b5L, the evaluation and empiric regimen would focus on pneumocystosis and CMV, although the previously mentioned processes that occur at high CD4+ T lymphocyte counts can also occur at lower CD4+ T lymphocyte counts. Keeping in mind that CD4+ T lymphocyte counts are useful predictors of susceptibility to infection is important, but they are not perfect. Occasionally, patients will develop opportunistic infections at \"uncharacteristically\" high CD4+ T lymphocyte counts. For instance, 5% to 10% of cases of pneumocystosis occur at CD4+ T lymphocyte counts greater than 200 cells/\u00b5L. 61 Clinical parameters can provide additional clues; for example, oral candidiasis, a previous opportunistic infection, a prior episode of pneumonia, or high viral load are independent risk factors for the occurrence of Pneumocystis jiroveci carinii pneumonia (PCP), and logically for other infections as well. 9 A frequent question is whether an HIV-infected patient's prior CD4+ T lymphocyte count nadir affects the likelihood of an opportunistic infection occurring if HAART has stimulated a CD4+ T lymphocyte count rise. Specifically, if a patient has a CD4+ T lymphocyte count of 400 cells/\u00b5L while receiving HAART and that patient's CD4+ T lymphocyte count was 50 cells/\u00b5L before HAART, is that patient at greater risk for developing an opportunistic infection than another patient whose current CD4+ T lymphocyte count is 400 cells/\u00b5L but whose nadir before HAART was 250 cells/\u00b5L? The data suggest that these two patients have comparable risk (i.e., the current CD4+ T lymphocyte count is the most important predictor of risk and the earlier nadir has only minor infl uence on opportunistic infection susceptibility). 62 In evaluating the differential diagnosis of infectious syndromes in patients with HIV (and in every other patient population as well), geography is an important part of the history. Tuberculosis is always a concern because of the extraordinary susceptibility of HIV-infected patients for developing active disease. 63 In many urban settings in the United States, each pulmonary evaluation should include smears and cultures for M. tuberculosis, both to diagnose the appropriate cause of the pulmonary dysfunction and to assist in determining what respiratory precautions are appropriate. In some areas of the country, such as the Ohio River Valley and Indianapolis, histoplasmosis is as common as pneumocystosis in causing diffuse pulmonary infi ltrates. 64 In the southwestern United States, coccidioidomycosis must be recognized as a cause of pulmonary infi ltrates. The clinical presentations of tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, and other processes such as CMV can be clinically indistinguishable from PCP. Thus for patients with pulmonary infi ltrates in an ICU, prolonged empiric therapy is discouraged in favor of vigorous efforts to establish a specifi c diagnosis.",

In those situations their management ordinarily requires no extraordinary measures, with two exceptions. First, the staff must be fully aware of how HIV is transmitted, the danger of injuries resulting from sharp objects, and the procedure for managing injuries involving sharp objects contaminated with blood or other biologic fl uids from infected or potentially infected patients. 65 Second, drug interactions involving drugs used during procedures and certain antiretroviral drugs can have important clinical consequences. 66, 67 Many of the protease inhibitors and the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors that are now the backbone of antiretroviral therapy can inhibit or enhance the metabolism of drugs that depend on the cytochrome P450 system. Thus the half-lives of certain analgesics, sedatives, and hypnotics can be prolonged in HIV-infected patients who are taking ritonavir, for example. This pharmacokinetic effect is also relevant for a host of other therapeutic agents used in the ICU and may affect their effi cacy or safety. Clinicians need to be familiar with these interactions when selecting new therapies for procedures or for clinical entities. ",

The median time to improvement in clinical variables is 4 to 8 days; therefore, changes in therapy are probably not warranted before 5 to 10 days. At that point the accuracy of the diagnosis should be reassessed: Consideration should be given to repeat bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy to determine if CMV, fungi, mycobacteria, or a nosocomial bacterial process is present. Noninfectious processes such as congestive heart failure or tumor (e.g., Kaposi's sarcoma) must also be considered. If pneumocystosis is the only causative process that can be identifi ed, corticosteroids should be added to the regimen if they have not been already. Whether switching from one antipneumocystis agent to another or whether adding a second agent is helpful has not been determined by clinical trials. Some human pneumocystosis isolates are resistant to sulfonamides, but such testing is available only in a few research centers. Most clinicians add parenteral pentamidine to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Parenteral trimetrexate or clindamycin-primaquine could be used as salvage regimens as well. Patients who have not improved after 14 to 21 days of therapy with specifi c chemotherapy plus corticosteroids have an exceedingly poor prognosis.",

Almost all HIV transmission in an occupational setting occurs as a result of injuries involving sharp instruments (e.g., needles, scalpels). The risk of such injuries is about one case of HIV transmission per 250 injuries, but the likelihood of transmission in an individual accident depends on the amount of viremia at the time of the accident (late-stage patients generally have more circulating virus than do early-stage patients) and the nature of the accident. Most authorities recommend immediate prophylaxis if a signifi cant injury occurs involving an HIV-infected patient. Considerable debate exists over the optimal choice of drugs and the optimal duration of therapy, but it is clear that initiating therapy within a period of hours rather than days is best.

Ultimately, however, clinical experience is necessary with each type of organ transplant and each immunosuppressive regimen to predict the most likely pathogens, when they most characteristically occur in relation to the transplant procedure, and what infl uence each immunosuppressive therapy has. An example of the temporal pattern of infectious complications after bone marrow transplantation is shown in Figure 54 -3. 9 Although such fi gures are useful conceptually, however, the immunosuppressive regimens are changing rapidly, and such fi gures may be misleading when applied to current transplantation protocols. Organ transplant recipients share a complex interaction between immunosuppression and infection. Immunosuppression is usually necessary in allogeneic transplantation to permit graft survival. The more potent the immunosuppression, the more likely infection is to occur. Strategies that use antimicrobial agents (drugs, vaccines, and other biologic products) aggressively may reduce the risk of and damage from infection in a manner that allows more potent immunosuppression and better graft survival.

Some programs are now using voriconazole prophylaxis. For such patients, mucormycosis and non-albicans Candida are becoming more prominent causes of morbidity. Thus clinicians must know what antifungal prophylaxis has been used in order to anticipate which complications will occur. Mold infections can be diffi cult to diagnose: serum galactomannan assays can yield specifi c information, but the test has low sensitivity. Mold infections almost never cause fungemia. Thus diagnosis depends on cultures, which can be highly suggestive if obtained from sources such as bronchoalveolar lavage or biopsy.",

When respiratory infections occur in immunocompromised patients, health care professionals need to be certain that a transmissible virus is not the cause because of the potential to infect other patients, families, or hospital staff. Of the respiratory infections, RSV deserves special attention in HSCT patients. Although RSV can, like other community-acquired viruses, cause disease in any patient population, it is especially lethal in solid organ, bone marrow, and stem cell transplants. Thus RSV must be specifi cally sought in this patient population, as well as their visitors and health care providers, so that it does not spread to highly susceptible patients.",

In choosing therapies, attention must be focused on the toxicities of antimicrobial agents and how they infl uence the outcome of the transplanted organ. In addition, drug interactions are important, especially with cyclosporine. Drugs that alter hepatic metabolism, such as rifampin, rifabutin, and fl uconazole, can have substantial infl uence on cyclosporine levels and thus need to be used with careful pharmacologic attention. Finally, clinicians must recognize that new immunosuppressive regimens and changing prophylactic regimens are changing the spectrum of infectious complications. As mentioned earlier, fungal infections are increasingly likely to be caused by species other than C. albicans: non-albicans Candida, Fusarium, and Rhizopus are recognized with increasing frequency. Similarly, prophylaxis with valganciclovir is reducing CMV disease and pushing disease that does occur later and later in relation to the transplant procedure. Viruses such as HHV-6 and BK virus are causing disease. Thus clinicians need to look for changing spectrum of pathogens, as well as changing manifestations if the morbidity and mortality caused by infection is to be managed optimally.",
