            "text": "Aerosol among many is one of the bad elements in air pollutants. In particular, aerosols less than 1 \u00b5m (PM1) can penetrate deep into the alveoli of our lung causing chronic respiratory and breathing disorder. Aerosols less than 100 nm (PM0.1) are referred to as nano-aerosols, nano-particles or ultrafine particles. By virtue of their tiny size, the nano-aerosols can easily diffuse into our blood stream surrounding the lung. Our circulation system can carry these aerosols to different parts of our body, including our brain, leading to various long-term harmful effects. In addition, airborne viruses, with sizes in the nano-aerosol range, can also lead to acute sickness. The recent novel coronavirus that has infected many people, as well as the previous SARS and MERS viruses, is also of size approximately 100 nm. Conventional filters made of microfibers with fiber diameter of 2\u201320 \u00b5m are ineffective in capturing these nano-aerosols. Nanofibers with fiber diameter of 200\u2013600 nm are effective in filtering the nano-aerosols (less than100 nm) by diffusion and aerosols greater than 100 nm by interception. On the other hand, aerosols larger than 1 \u00b5m can be captured effectively by inertia impaction. Here, we consider a special nanofiber filter that is electrostatically charged \u2013 nanofiber electret filter. In particular, we will study the behavior of these filters as they are loaded with the nano-aerosols. We have broadened up the size range in our study to not only the nano-aerosols size less than 100 nm but extending all the way to 500 nm. In general, we will refer hereafter to this size range as just aerosols or particles in short.",

Nevertheless, as a filter is continually challenged with aerosols, both the aerosol penetration (i.e. inverse of the efficiency) and the filter resistance (i.e. pressure drop) gradually change while the filter becomes increasingly loaded [2], [3].

            "text": "In terms of filtration efficiency, as a departure from conventional uncharged filters which show increasing values throughout the loading process, the efficiency of electret filters initially decreases to a certain point before increasing with loading. This phenomenon is due to the shielding of electrostatic effect by the aerosol deposition and the enhanced mechanical capture due to deposit that can be considered as artificial fibers. Ultimately, an aerosol cake forms on the filter surface which becomes the effective surface filter media [2], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. In the early stage of filtration using an electrically active fibrous filter, electrostatic mechanism, including Coulombic force collection for charged particles and induction charging collection for uncharged particles, plays the dominant role in aerosol capture. With continuous filtration, the initially captured particles act as collection sites for the latter particles and gradually form dendritic structures. The adjacent dendrites gradually get connected together, which initiates the formation of a \u201ccake\u201d on the upstream end of the filter. During the dendrites/cake growth stage, the electrostatic effect diminishes because of the \u201cshielding effect\u201d on the fiber charges by deposited particles, while the mechanical collection enhances contributed by the dendrites/cake. The filtration efficiency keeps decreasing until the reduction in electrostatic efficiency is equally compensated by the improvement in mechanical efficiency, at which point the filtration efficiency falls to its minimum value before increasing thereafter. On forming a complete cake layer (cake filtration stage), particle penetration falls to zero (or filter efficiency reaches 100%), where electrostatic effect is fully shielded and the future incoming particles are solely collected via the mechanical effect of the cake layer, i.e., the aerosol capture has totally transferred from depth filtration to surface filtration.",

Due to the exceedingly limited space occupied by the captured particles, the fluid flow is only slightly affected and the pressure drop increases at rather low rates. With dendrites/cake forming and the filter more and more clogged, the pressure drop keeps rising at an accelerating rate. When the cake is completely formed, the increase rate of pressure drop reaches its peak value, after which the rate of pressure drop increases linearly with the loading mass, indicting a constant cake resistance growth with additional aerosol deposit.",

            "text": "From the description above, it seems that an electret filter only has a minor advantage of initially higher filtration efficiency over a conventional filter regarding aerosol loading process because it basically works as a surface filter once being fully clogged. However, due to the big role played by electrostatic mechanism in the early stage of loading, it is naturally expected that for an electret filter, the deposition properties of particles, including the capture position, dendrite/cake formation rates and cake structures, are different from a pure mechanical filter. Therefore, the electret filter may show a different pressure drop increase characteristic in the subsequent cake filtration. In fact, the lower clogging rates of some electrically active fibrous filters have already been reported in the literature and the authors attributed the improved holding capacities to more uniform distribution of deposited particles. Nonetheless, without investigating the real morphology of particle deposition, such as use of SEM images on deposition pattern in the filter, previous researches merely qualitatively drew conclusions based on the difference in pressure drop evolutions between electret and mechanical filters [4], [5], [6]. Moreover, the electret filters in these researches usually had large thicknesses within just one single layer and multiple layers of electret have not been studied. Further, it has been well proved that \u201cskin effect\u201d exists in aerosol filtration using a fibrous filter, where much more particles deposit at the face region than at the back side [9], [10]. For an electret filter, that means when a complete cake is already formed on the surface of the filter, the charged fibers downstream of the surface fibers are far from being fully utilized and wasted.",

Due to the higher porosity and smaller thickness of each layer in the multilayer filter, it will take a longer time for the dendrites to grow to a significant size to block the aerosol flow. Thus, the pace of skin layer formation slows down and aerosol capture across the filter layers is more uniform. Specifically, for the charged multilayer PVDF filters, the charges on the fibers of downstream layers are more effectively being utilized. Further, on the level of individual fibers, the captured particles are expected to be more uniformly distributed circumferentially and lengthwise along the fibers.",

PVDF solution properties and electrospinning conditions were finely tuned to get continuous, straight and defect-free fibers [11], [12]. To alleviate the nonuniform distribution of fibers, the collecting substrate was horizontally inversed at intervals during each batch of electrospinning. The fiber basis weight was closely monitored throughout the spinning process until the target value was reached. Multilayer filters were prepared by stacking up a certain number of 1-layer filter modules with identical physical properties. In this study, 4-layer PVDF filters were used to distinctly show the different loading behaviors from the 1-layer counterparts having the same basis weight of nanofibers. Based on charging state, the filters could be divided into uncharged and charged (electret) filters, with the former prepared by discharging the pristine filters using isopropanol while the latter was obtained by subsequent charging the \u201cuncharged\u201d filters using corona discharge. Each filter was named according to its configuration (S for single layer and M for multiple layers), layer basis weight (the same as filter basis weight for 1-layer filters) and charging state (U for uncharged and C for charged). For instance, S-3.060-U refers to the uncharged 1-layer PVDF filter with the layer basis weight of 3.060 gsm, while M4-0.765-C denotes the charged 4-layer PVDF filter with the layer basis weight of 0.765 gsm for each layer, but the total basis weight for all 4 layers added up to 3.060 gsm.

After the first neutralizer, the polydisperse aerosols were directly fed to the test column to challenge the filter. The reason for the modification was that it would take impractical long time to load up the filter. Every ten minutes, the aerosol flow upstream of the filter was sampled via the DMA to get the size distribution of the particles used for filter loading, coupled with the CPC to measure particle concentrations channel by channel. Note that in the set-up for filter loading, the real concentrations shown in aerosol size distribution were obtained by automatically calculating the corresponding values measured by the CPC which only counted the relatively low fractional particles exiting the DMA. At prescribed intervals, the set-up was switched back to that of Fig. 1a for testing the filtration efficiency with loading mass until the values all increase approximately to 100%, after which the efficiency testing (i.e. Fig. 1a) was stopped as a cake has already formed on the filter surface and surface filtration was the only mechanism for aerosol capture. The set-up for aerosol loading was not used to determine filtration efficiency because of the difficulty in tuning the equipment response time for polydisperse aerosols, which could bring inaccurate and misleading results. Throughout the loading process, the pressure drop was monitored at regular intervals, which was expected to show a linear trend after the formation of the full cake. The loading was terminated until the pressure drop reached an arbitrary limit which had been far past the starting point of complete surface filtration.

            "text": "The filtration efficiency curves of S-3.060-U and M4-0.765-U with loading time/loaded mass are shown in Fig. 4\na and b, respectively. Generally, the two uncharged filters show similar trends with the efficiency increasing with loading time/loaded mass, which has been widely confirmed in the literature [9], [10], [14]. The deposited aerosols, including individual particles, dendrites and cake, could all act as new aerosol collection sites, or as additional \u2018artificial fibers\u2019, thus improving the filtration efficiency, as well as increasing the pressure drop across the filter [15], [16], [17]. It is also interesting to note that the most penetrating particle sizes (MPPS) of both filters gradually decreased with loading mass\u2014from 250 nm to 80 nm for S-3.060-U and from 280 nm to 80 nm for M4-0.765-U as shown in Fig. 5\n. Similar phenomenon was also observed by Leung et al. [9], [10]. This is due to the more prominent interception effect than the diffusion effect of the deposited aerosol agglomeration, with the two effects being the main mechanisms for filtration efficiency improvement before surface filtration took place. However, regardless of the similarities, the efficiency of S-3.060-U apparently increased at a much higher rate than that of M4-0.765-U. In clean state, the two filters had similar efficiency curves. After 2-h loading, the efficiency of S-3.060-U at the MPPS (120 nm) drastically increased to 91.9% from the clean filter efficiency of 45.6%, while that of M4-0.765-U at 280 nm increased only from 40.1% to 43.8%. Overall, it merely took only 4 h for S-3.060-U to reach approximately the efficiency of 100% for all challenging particles in contrast to 14 h for M4-0.765-U. Due to the constantly higher filtration efficiency, more aerosols deposited on S-3.060-U than M4-0.765-U at the same loading time. For example, after 2-h loading, S-3.060-U had a loaded mass of 2.25 gsm, which was 0.67 gsm higher than 1.58 gsm for M4-0.765-U. Corresponding to filtration efficiency, the pressure drop of S-3.060-U rose much faster than that of M4-0.765-U. Before loading, the pressure drop values were 20.8 Pa and 16.9 Pa for S-3.060-U and M4-0.765-U, respectively. After 2 h loading, the pressure drop for S-3.060-U increased by 42.8 Pa while only 1.5 Pa for M4-0.765-U. Barely 4 h elapse, S-3.060-U has reached 180.5 Pa. In contrast, 12 h elapse was required for M4-0.765-U to reach 189.3 Pa.",

Moreover, benefitting from the higher uniformity of aerosol deposition across the filter, M4-0.765-U had much lower increase in pressure drop per loaded aerosol mass than S-3.060-U. In other words, multilayer filters could mitigate the clogging by aerosol accumulation and enhance the aerosol holding capacity. As can be seen in Fig. 4a-b, when the filtration efficiency approached near 100%, M4-0.765-U had an aerosol loaded mass of 16.76 gsm (at 14 h) while S-3.060-U only 6.48 gsm (at 4 h). The only drawback for M4-0.765-U is that the efficiency before approaching the deposit of 6.1 gsm (8 h) was less than 80% whereas S-3.060-U with about 1-gsm deposit (1\u20132 h) could achieve 80% efficiency so that loss of uncaptured aerosols was reduced.",

Both curves show the typical trend where pressure drop increased slowly in the early stage of loading, followed by an accelerating increase until the cakes were formed and the curves became linear lines with the deposition mass [9], [10], [14]. Nonetheless, for S-3.060-U, the early stage was much shorter than that of M4-0.765-U. As shown in Fig. 6, the clogging point, where cake formation initiated, for each curve can be obtained by extrapolating the linear portion of the pressure drop excursion curve to intersect the deposition mass axis and reading off the value of the deposited mass [4], [5]. M4-0.765-U had a clogging point of 10.16 gsm which was 2.36 times higher than that of 4.31 gsm for S-3.060-U. This further indicates that the multilayer filter had a higher aerosol holding capacity and was less prone to clogging due to the high filter porosity of each layer. As a result, even the downstream layers such as second, third and fourth layer in M4-0.765-U could effectively capture aerosols, unlike the case of a single layer. We shall see this in the SEM images to be presented in the latter section.",

S-3.060-U, with only one layer, had a high fiber packing fraction and a low porosity. The space between individual fibers was so small that dendrites formed and grew considerably fast into a cake on the filter surface with the high concentration of challenging aerosols. The result was the rapid increase in both filtration efficiency and pressure drop and the insufficiently utilized nanofibers downstream of the filter surface [9], [10]. By redistributing the same amounts of fibers from the initial single layer to 4 layers, with each layer of M4-0.765-U consisting of much loosely packed fibers, the challenging aerosols could penetrate to the downstream layers of the filter before dendrites and cake grew to an extent that seriously blocked the incoming aerosol stream. This hypothesis was confirmed by SEM images of the loaded filters. Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9\nare SEM images which depict the aerosol deposition on the front or back side of loaded S-3.060-U and each layer of M4-0.765-U, respectively. The surface of the loaded S-3.060-U is covered by a cake (Fig. 7a\u2013b); therefore, it is difficult to infer the aerosol profile within the filter. However, from the back side of the loaded S-3.060-U as shown in Fig. 7c\u2013d, it can be observed that not many particles are present across the filter depth especially at the downstream end of the filter on the back side.",

            "text": "On the contrary, aerosol deposits more uniformly across the four layers of M4-0.765-U (Fig. 8, Fig. 9), though the loaded amount decreases with the layer depth. When a multilayer filter is used for aerosol filtration, a portion of the aerosols is filtered out by the first layer upstream directly facing the challenging stream, leaving the rest of the aerosols challenging the downstream layers. The result is that fewer aerosol particles are available for the downstream layers. If every layer has similar structures and thus similar filtration efficiency in clean state, more aerosols will deposit on the layer more upstream at any given time, making its filtration efficiency and pressure drop always higher and increase at faster rates than the layers downstream. This is actually the very reason for \u201cskin layer\u201d effect which was also observed by Leung et al. [9], [10]. In Figs. 8e\u2013h and 9e\u2013h, nevertheless, quite a large number of particles were still deposited on the last two downstream layers in M4-0.765-U, benefiting from the high permeability of each layer.",

However, due to the large fiber diameter of the filters used in this research (525 nm), Brownian diffusion was just a minor mechanism whereas interception played the major role for the uncharged filters, leaving aerosols mainly depositing on the front or side surfaces of uncharged fibers [2].",

Fig. 10\na shows the filtration efficiency evolution of S-3.060-C-1. Contrary to the expectation, the efficiency increased all the time till surface filtration was reached, despite that the clean filter exhibited a typical efficiency pattern of charged PVDF nanofiber filters, with the value increasing from 80.7% at 50 nm to 88.0% at 500 nm. After 1-h loading, mechanical filtration was the dominant mechanism indicated from the efficiency curve, and the efficiency was 92.6% at MPPS (particle with the lowest grade efficiency) of 250 nm. Gradually, the efficiency approached approximately 100% and the MPPS dropped to 80 nm (Fig. 5). Correspondingly, the pressure drop of S-3.060-C-1 increased sharply by 146.7 Pa from the initial 21.1 Pa after 3-h loading with a deposited mass of 6.80 gsm.",

As can be seen from Fig. 10b, similar to S-3.060-C-1, the pressure drop of S-3.060-C-2 rose from 24.5 to 170.4 Pa with 7.45 gsm of deposited mass after 3 h. However, the filtration efficiency did decrease in the first 10 min and increase in the next 10 min. Subsequent loading time followed similar trend as that of S-3.060-C-1. Nonetheless, the largest reduction in efficiency of particles was only 2.7% which was too small to draw a convincing conclusion. It is also worth mentioning that S-3.060-C-1 and S-3.060-C-2 behaved a little differently concerning the variation of filtration efficiency, pressure drop and loaded mass, which was because of the randomness and inhomogeneity of fibers and charge distributions on the filters [18].",

            "text": "Considering the high concentration of aerosol flow for loading up the filter, it was hypothesized that, once the loading began, the mechanical effect strengthened so fast that the mechanical efficiency improvement trumped the electrostatic efficiency loss. Therefore, in another test an aerosol flow with much lower concentrations (shown in Fig. 11\n) was applied for 3 h to load up a third similar charged filter (525-S-3.060-C-3). After the first 3 h, the aerosol concentration was raised to the value used for loading up S-3.060-C-1 and S-3.060-C-2, which was aimed to further confirm the influence of loading aerosol concentration qualitatively. As shown in Fig. 10c, after 0.25-h loading, there were remarkable decreases in filtration efficiency for all-sized particles, especially for those with larger sizes. Particles of 350 nm (MPPS at 0.25 h as shown in Fig. 5) experienced a reduction of 22.4% from 77.6% to 55.2%. After further reductions ranging from 0.8% to 4.3% at 0.5 h, slowly the efficiency values increased and the MPPS decreased, with 60.7% of filtration efficiency at an MPPS of 220 nm. Note that for extremely small particles, the variations in filtration were insignificant. For instance, the efficiency for 50-nm particles slightly varied between 74.9% and 82.4%. This should result from the different mechanisms dominating filtration by electret filters for neutralized aerosols with different sizes [2], [3]. In this research, particles were brought to a Boltzmann charge distribution before challenging a filter, with most of them being zero-charged so induction charging followed by electrostatic attraction (i.e. dielectrophoretic filtration) were the main mechanisms for electrostatic filtration. Compared with larger particles, small particles were less prone to induction effect as the positive/negative charge separation distance is also smaller, therefore they were less affected when the charge on filters were shielded by aerosol deposition. It should be pointed out that from 0.5 h to 1 h, the filtration efficiency of particles with sizes between 40 nm and 220 nm decreased while that of the rest increased. The reason might be that during this period, the decrease in electrostatic efficiency was not fully compensated by the increase in mechanical efficiency, leading to the further efficiency reduction for smaller particles. While for larger particles, they might be trapped due to the increasingly strong surface filtration effect. During 1\u20133 h, the filtration efficiency increased with slow paces and the average value remained low, corresponding to the gradual increase of loaded aerosol mass from 1.35 to 3.82 gsm.",

For instance, the pressure drop of S-3.060-C-3 with 3.82 gsm of deposited aerosols was only 28.7 Pa, while that of S-3.060-C-1 and S-3.060-C-2 with fewer loaded aerosols (2.46 and 3.03 gsm, respectively) reached 64.8 and 73.4 Pa, respectively. The much alleviated air flow resistance of S-3.060-C-3 was attributed to the low aerosol loading concentration, which prevented the fast formation of dendrites and cake on the filter surface and the downstream fibers and fibrous layers became more accessible. Similar conclusion was obtained for microfiber electret filter by Tang et al., where higher particle concentrations led to higher increase rates of pressure drop and lower clogging points from the faster formation of dendrites and cake [8]. This point was further proved by the characterization of the deposited particles. As shown in SEM images in Fig. 12\na\u2013b, more particles were present on the interior fibers of S-3.060-C-3 than S-3.060-C-1 observed from the back side of loaded filters. In contrast to 1\u20133 h, from 3 to 4 h, there was a great surge in filtration efficiency, which was in accordance with the significant increase in the concentration of loading aerosols. Afterwards, the filtration efficiency of S-3.060-C-3 increased with a trend similar to the aerosol loading during 1\u20133 h of S-3.060-C-1 and S-3.060-C-2. Corresponding to the filtration efficiency, the pressure drop during 3\u20137 h increased with significantly higher rates than that during 0\u20133 h, indicating the much faster growth of dendrites. Because more aerosols deposited within the filter, when the filter efficiency reached 100%, S-3.060-C-3 had 8.86 gsm of loaded aerosols (at 136.6 Pa). This was higher than both S-3.060-C-1 (6.80 gsm at 167.8 Pa) and S-3.060-C-2 (7.45 gsm at 170.4 Pa). Through the loading tests for S-3.060-C, aerosol concentrations in the challenging airflow were shown to affect the loading behaviors of a filter. Nevertheless, the major aim of this study was to investigate the differences in aerosol holding capacities among various test filters. Therefore, aerosols with similar size distribution were used for most loading tests and no further experiments using varied aerosol concentrations were conducted.",

With the same loading time and aerosol concentrations, the aerosol deposition amount was higher for the charged filter owning to the constantly higher filtration efficiency. For instance, at 2 h, 3.69 gsm of aerosols were loaded on S-3.060-C-1 while 2.25 gsm on S-3.060-U. Moreover, the pressure drop of S-3.060-C-1 increased at slightly lower rates than the uncharged filter with loaded mass before reaching 100% filter efficiency, see Fig. 13\n. For example, S-3.060-C-1 and S-3.060-U had pressure drop of 64.8 and 63.6 Pa with loaded masses of 2.46 and 2.25 gsm, respectively. This was attributed by the more uniform distribution of captured aerosols on individual charged fibers than on uncharged fibers [2], [5], [16]. That is, more aerosols could be captured on the back side of the charged fibers due to dielectrophoretic filtration effect, resulting in slower dendrites formation within S-3.060-C-1. In fact, the slope of the linear portion of the pressure excursion curve indicates the pressure drop from the additional cake deposited on the nanofiber filter. With reference to Fig. 13, the S-3.060-C-1 has a lower slope (33.3 Pa gsm\u22121), thus a lower pressure drop than that of S-3.060-U (40 Pa gsm\u22121). The charged filter represents a 17% reduction as compared to the uncharged one. This may have to do with the more porous cake formed on the electret nanofiber media as captured aerosols were distributed on both front and back faces of the fibers as well as distributed further into the filter than the uncharged counterpart. In other words, the skin effect was somewhat reduced; however, this advantage would have been much fully utilized for the multilayer charged filter which will be investigated in the next section.",

As we have seen, if the fiber packing density was not sufficiently low, a cake could form after a short loading period, leaving the charged fibers downstream of the \u201cskin layer\u201d insufficiently utilized. As shown in Fig. 15c\u2013d, not many aerosols can be seen within the loaded S-3.060-C-1 looking through the filter toward upstream from the back side. Owing to the electrostatic effect, a fraction of the particles penetrating S-3.060-C-1 were attracted by the charged fibers on the back side surface. Nonetheless, most particles had already been trapped in the \u201cskin layer\u201d due to the low porosity and the high initial filtration efficiency, thus only a small number of particles can be observed on the back side of S-3.060-C-1. Based on this, the multilayer electret filter was investigated to explore if the filter can be fully utilized across the entire filter thickness from upstream to downstream by redistributing the charged fibers in the filter.",

Fig. 16\na shows the filtration efficiency variation of M4-0.765-C-1 with loading time, where the filter exhibits a clearer trend of an initial decrease and a latter continuous increase of efficiency till reaching nearly 100%. From 0 h to 2 h, the efficiency values gradually dropped. More reduction was observed for large particles while insignificant changes for very small ones, which was due to the more prominent electrostatic induction effect towards aerosols with larger diameters [2], [3]. After 3 h aerosol loading, the filtration efficiency curve transferred to a typical shape of a mechanical filter from the curve after 2 h, which depicts a strong electrostatic mechanism. This means mechanical filtration, mainly by the growing dendrites and cake, began to play a remarkable role in trapping aerosols, especially for the smaller ones (40\u201360 nm) for which the efficiency increased while that of others were still decreasing during 3\u20134 h. From 4 h on, the enhancement of mechanical filtration exceeded the decline of electrostatic filtration. Meanwhile, the filtration efficiency increased at high rates with the slowly decreasing MPPS (Fig. 5) from 80.0% at 280 nm to 99.1% at 150 nm.",

            "text": "Similar to S-3.060-C-1, benefitting from the electrostatic effect, M4-0.765-C-1 had continuously higher filtration efficiency and deposited aerosol mass than its uncharged counterpart M4-0.765-U before 100% of filtration efficiency. However, the pressure drop of M4-0.765-C-1 was significantly lower than that of M4-0.765-U with similar loaded mass, especially at higher deposition amounts. M4-0.765-U and M4-0.765-C-1 had pressure drop of 45.9 and 25.7 Pa with 6.11 and 6.28 gsm of loaded masses, whereas 337.0 and 150.5 Pa with 16.76 and 18.30 gsm, respectively. The prominently alleviated air flow resistance shows that the advantage of charged fibers of uniform aerosol deposition was greatly enhanced through redistributing the same amount of nanofibers of S-3.060-C-1 into the 4 layers of M4-0.765-C-1. Though S-3.060-C-1 always filtered out more aerosols than M4-0.765-C-1, the captured aerosols accumulated so fast on the surface of the 1-layer filter that it progressed to cake filtration in an extremely short time. M4-0.765-C-1 and S-3.060-C-1 had pressure drop values of 18.1 Pa and 21.1 Pa in clean state, respectively. After 1-h loading with similar aerosol loaded masses (1.32 and 1.28 gsm, respectively), the pressure drop of the former filter increased to 20.8 Pa, less than half that of the latter which increased to 43.2 Pa. With an additional 1-h loading, M4-0.765-C-1 had an increase of only 2.2 Pa in air flow resistance with 1.84-gsm added deposit, in contrast to the huge increase of 50.9 Pa for S-3.060-C-1 with an additional 2.41 gsm. When complete filtration was reached on each filter, it took 12 h for the 4-layer filter with 26.09 gsm of loaded aerosols, 9 h longer and 19.29 gsm more than its 1-layer counterpart. The much slower saturation rate of aerosols in the filter demonstrates the merits of multilayering for electret filters. During the loading process of S-3.060-C-1 with a high fiber packing density, dendrites and cake shielded the filter surface in such a short period that charges as well as fibers within the filter were far from being sufficiently used [8]. In contrast, by separating fibers to different layers, as the surface of the upstream layers was porous enough, the charges on both sides of the fibers in the downstream layers were more accessible to aerosols, thus trapping more aerosols while maintaining a significantly lower increase rate of pressure drop. Also, as a departure from M4-0.765-U, each layer of M4-0.765-C-1 experienced an initial drop of filtration efficiency. This facilitated the penetration of more aerosols through the upstream to downstream layers and consequently more uniform aerosol distribution across the electret filter. It is also worth noting that the filtration efficiency kept at relatively high values for particles of all sizes, indicating that aerosol penetration in the initial loading stage was not significant and the filter has a potential for real application.",

The charged 4-layer filter had a much lower pressure drop than that of the uncharged 4-layer filter and the charged 1-layer filter, respectively. This can be explained by the more efficient use of electrostatic effect of the charged filter downstream of the filter surface after multilayering. With this merit, not only aerosols could be deposited on the back of fibers but also distribute more uniformly across the entire filter. Therefore, the formation and growth rates of dendrites and cake, which catalyzed the formation of skin layer, were reduced at the upstream layer.",

Figs. 19\nand 20\nrespectively show different layers of the loaded M4-0.765-C-1 seen from the front and the back sides of the filter. By comparison, more aerosols deposited on both sides of the fibers of the two middle layers of M4-0.765-C-1 (Fig. 19, Fig. 20) than the fibers deep in S-3.060-C-1 (Fig. 15c\u2013d), revealed more effective use of charged fibers across the filter. Compared with M4-0.765-U (Fig. 8), the aerosol deposition across the four layers of M4-0.765-C-1 was more uniform, which was attributed to the role of electrostatic mechanism in aerosol capture [2], [5], [16], [19]. Moreover, many particles can be seen adhering to the back side of individual fibers in all the layers of M4-0.765-C-1 (Fig. 20), resulting from the charges uniformly distributed on the fibers in these layers. In contrast, nearly no particles can be observed at the similar positions of M4-0.765-U (Fig. 9). Besides, the main size of particles seems to decrease with layer depth for M4-0.765-C-1 while this phenomenon was not found for M4-0.765-U. This can be explained by the relation between the size of uncharged particles and the strength of induction effect by charged fibers. As is well known, large particles are prone to charge induction than small particles, therefore the dipoles for larger particles are stronger, and electrostatic mechanism is more pronounced for the capture of bigger size particles [2], [3]. During the loading process of M4-0.765-C-1, larger aerosols were removed more by the first layer and smaller aerosols were more penetrating, resulting in relatively high fraction of smaller-sized aerosols in the more downstream layers. Prominently, there was a classification effect on particle size with the multilayer electret nanofiber filter.",

            "text": "Both SU and SC have a short, 3\u20134 h, depth filtration as a skin formed quickly upstream of the filter layer, leaving the downstream layers of the filter not fully utilized for aerosol capture. This has been discussed and confirmed previously by the SEM images. Interestingly, the total mass deposit in depth filtration from the charged filter SC was actually 6.8 gsm, 0.3 gsm more than the uncharged filter SU with deposit of 6.5 gsm; yet \u0394p\n1 was slightly lower at 168 Pa for SC versus 181 Pa for SU. This was all courtesy of the electrostatic mechanism in assisting capture of the aerosols forming a more porous aerosol deposit structure inside the filter, with perhaps lowered skin effect. In subsequent cake filtration, 17.5\u201319.6 gsm of aerosols were deposited in form of a cake, the higher deposit was attributed to SC despite there was no added electrostatic force due to complete shielding of the charged fibers in the filter by the cake, but the cake formed from the charged filter was found to have a more porous structure. The pressure drop for cake filtration was higher for SC versus SU, 632 Pa versus 619 Pa, but the rate of increase of pressure drop per additional deposit, \u0394p\nC/\u0394M\nC, is actually lower at 32 Pa gsm\u22121 for SC versus 35 Pa gsm\u22121 for SU. This indeed supports the assumption that the formed SC cake was more porous and permeable. A more direct measure on the pressure drop per deposit mass is obtained from the slope of the graph, Fig. 13. As seen in Table 1, SC gives a slope of 35 Pa gsm\u22121 while SU gives 40 Pa gsm\u22121. Based on these considerations in both depth and cake filtration, the SC filter is better than the SU filter. Interestingly, the clog point (Point 3 in Fig. 21) has been suggested for evaluating the filter clogging during cake formation. The clog point is a hypothetical point wherein the aerosol loading in the filter during depth filtration is replaced by a hypothetical clogging point corresponding to an initial deposition in the filter at equivalent zero pressure drop. Simply put, it is an extrapolation of the \u2018cake line\u2019 extending to zero \u0394p. Based on this, the clog points for the 4 filters are determined in Table 1 for SC as 2.8 gsm and SU as 4.2 gsm. From the clog point consideration, it appears that the SC filter is more clogged during depth filtration than SU which is incorrect! As can be seen in Table 1, the average \u0394p/\u0394MD is 22 Pa gsm\u22121 for SC which is lower than 25 Pa gsm\u22121 for SU. This casts a shadow of doubt on the use of the clog point as an index for comparison between filters. In fact, what is important is the rate of increase, i.e. \u0394pC/\u0394MC, between the two filters as demonstrated herein.",

            "text": "The MU allows a better utilization of the filter trapping more aerosols not only in the upstream layers but also in the downstream layers as compared to SU. This is even more so when the nanofiber filter is charged. As a result, from Table 1, 16.8 gsm of aerosols had been captured in depth filtration for MU during depth filtration. On the other hand, MC had 55% more trapped aerosols reaching 26.1gsm. This is courtesy of the charged fibers that trapped aerosols by electrostatic interaction on all surfaces of the fiber in additional to interception mechanism. Further, all the layers across the entire filter depth from upstream to downstream were fully utilized for capturing aerosols. This provides a good combat against the skin effect which affects greatly the single layer charged/uncharged filters and also the multilayer uncharged filter to some extent. Given the aerosols are uniformly distributed across the filter, the pressure drop, \u0394p\n1, was 6% lower at 316 Pa for MC as compared to 337 Pa for MU despite it had more aerosols trapped. In fact, the average \u0394p\nC/\u0394M\nC for MC is indeed very low at 11 Pa gsm\u22121 while that of MU is 19 Pa gsm\u22121. In subsequent cake filtration, the pressure drop rose very steeply with increasing deposit. Such steep rise was attributed to the fact that a cake was formed on a filter with both PVDF fibers as well as deposit trapped in the filter that acted also like artificial fibers [21]. This was equivalent to a filter with higher fiber packing density which resulted in an impervious cake with high pressure drop to fluid flow. Indeed, in surface filtration the MU filter had a further increase in \u0394p of 463 Pa for 9.6-gsm cake, while MC had an increase in \u0394p of 484 Pa for 10.4-gsm cake. In fact, from the slope of the curve from Fig. 17, \u0394p\nC/\u0394M\nC is 53 Pa gsm\u22121 for MU and is greater than 49 Pa gsm\u22121 for MC, given the skin effect for the latter was being reduced. Despite both pressure-drop increase was much higher than their counterparts \u2013 the single layer, cake filtration duration for the multilayer filters was shorter. From Table 1, only 28% of aerosol deposit was attributed to cake filtration for MC and 37% for MU. This demonstrates cake filtration was indeed short for the multilayer filters. This was actually favorable otherwise the pressure escalation could be extremely high in cake filtration taking away the earlier benefit of depth filtration where most aerosols were deposited.",

            "text": "On the contrary, it is the reverse for single-layer filter uncharged and charged. From Table 1, 74% of aerosol deposit was attributed to cake filtration for SC and 73% for SU. Therefore, majority of the aerosol deposit were made during cake filtration for the single-layer filters, uncharged and charged, as a skin formed very fast upstream of the filter for the single layer nanofiber filter (charged/uncharged) that quickly changed over to cake filtration. The multilayer filters (MC and MU) had a long depth filtration period with short steep pressure gradient in cake filtration. On the other hand, the single layer filters (SC and SU) had short depth filtration (not fully utilizing the filter downstream) with milder pressure rise in cake filtration. The behavior of these 4 filters were rather \u2018polarized\u2019 but the ultimate question is which filter had the highest capacity for trapping and storing aerosols when a pressure drop limit was imposed on the filtration cycle? In the present study, the pressure limit was set at 800 Pa which was similar in value to our early investigation [22]. Overall, with a maximum pressure drop of 800 Pa for the filter operation, MC had a total capacity of 36.5 gsm, both MU and SC had equal capacity of 26.4 gsm, and SU had 24 gsm. (Note the media resistance for all 4 filters in their clean state was within a narrow range between 16.9 and 21.1 Pa, see Table 1.) Both efficiency and capacity results are summarized for the 4 filters in Table 2\nbased on a maximum pressure drop of 800 Pa. In order of descending performance based on efficiency and capacity, MC is the best followed by SC, then MU, and finally SU. The two charged filters are better than their uncharged counterparts. MC has 52% more storage capacity than SU, and it has also 38% more capacity than both SC and MU. Note, the clog point that is used for assessing loading of filters do not provide meaningful interpretation on the capacity nor pressure drop in our present filter study despite we have also included their values in Table 1 for reference.",

Distinctive results were acquired and analyzed, which led to several conclusions listed below:(1)With loaded aerosol mass, the filtration efficiency of uncharged filters increased while that of charged filters initially decreased and then increased until reaching 100%. Nonetheless, the charged filters always had higher efficiency than the uncharged counterparts before a complete cake was formed on the filter.(2)For the charged filters during the initial stage of aerosol loading, the deposited aerosols influenced the capture efficiency of particles by the diminishing electrostatic effect and the growing mechanical filtration effect, with larger particles more affected by the variation of the former effect.(3)In uncharged state, the 1-layer filter had a lower aerosol holding capacity than the multilayer filter with the same basis weights, due to the quick formation of \u201cskin aerosol layer\u201d from the low filter porosity and the initial high filtration efficiency.(4)Combining the advantages of multilayering and charging, the charged multilayer filter had the best aerosol holding capacity and the highest aerosol distribution uniformity, which was further enhanced by the more sufficient use of charges on individual fibers across the entire filter depth/thickness. Under the same loading conditions with a maximum pressure drop of say, 800 Pa, filter performance based on efficiency and capacity is in the order of:a.charged multilayer filterb.charged 1-layer filterc.uncharged multilayer filterd.uncharged 1-layer filter\n(5)The multilayer nanofiber had approximately 70% aerosols trapped in the filter and 30% trapped in the cake, while the single layer nanofiber had 30% aerosols trapped in the filter and 70% trapped in the cake.(6)The 4-layer electret nanofiber filter with 3 gsm of basis weight has 4 times more aerosol holding capacity than the single uncharged/charged nanofiber filter with the same fiber basis weight in depth filtration.(7)In a filtration operation with 800 Pa maximum pressure, the 4-layer electret nanofiber filter with 3-gsm basis weight had 52% more aerosol holding capacity than the single uncharged nanofiber filter.
