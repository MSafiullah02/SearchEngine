            "text": "Rhinoviruses (RV) are a common cause of acute respiratory infection in people of all ages (Fawkner-Corbett et al., 2015, Puro et al., 2005). RVs are antigenically diverse, thus people can be infected with different RV types over the course of a lifetime (Cooney et al., 1982, Cooney et al., 1975). The spectrum of disease associated with this group of viruses can range from asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory tract infection (common cold) to severe lower respiratory tract infections which may include bronchiolitis or pneumonia (Choi et al., 2015, Iwane et al., 2011, Luchsinger et al., 2014). RV has been identified as an important contributor to acute asthma (Bizzintino et al., 2011) and wheezing illness in young children is an important risk factor in the development of asthma later in life (Jackson et al., 2008). Further, RV exacerbates pre-existing airway diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (Camargo et al., 2012, Kennedy et al., 2014, Luchsinger et al., 2014).",

RV-C is the most recently described species and to date there are 55 recognised genotypes. Clinical significance of RV-C is still debated as some studies report that RV-C causes more severe disease than the other two species (Bizzintino et al., 2011, Cox et al., 2013, Miller et al., 2009) but others have not found this association (Iwane et al., 2011, Linsuwanon et al., 2009). Inaccurate quantitative methods complicate the evaluation of viral factors that may contribute to disease severity (Schibler et al., 2012). Viral load studies of other viruses have shown that the amount of replicating virus is an important contributor to disease severity (Franz et al., 2010, Jansen et al., 2010), thus an accurate and reliable method of quantifying RV-C load may be an important tool in understanding the contribution of RV-C to disease pathogenesis, disease progression and clinical management.",

Molecular methods have overcome this problem, but the inter-genotype sequence variation within the target region prevents the design of a single quantitative assay that quantifies all genotypes at equal efficiencies (Schibler et al., 2012).

Similar to other acute viral respiratory tract infections where a correlation exists between viral load and disease severity (DeVincenzo et al., 2010, Li et al., 2010, Roussy et al., 2014, To et al., 2010), it is suspected that RV-C load may also drive disease severity. Inaccurate quantitative methods complicate the evaluation of viral factors that may contribute to disease severity (Schibler et al., 2012). Previously published quantitative assays have tried to address the genetic heterogeneity of RV-C by either using an intercalating dye in place of a specific hydrolysis probe or adding degenerate bases in either the primer or probe sequence (Bochkov et al., 2011, Granados et al., 2012). However, accuracy maybe impaired since these techniques may lead to non-specific amplification and reduced amplification efficiencies of the assays (Chemidlin Prevost-Boure et al., 2011, Schibler et al., 2012).",

A portion in the 5\u2032UTR was chosen as a target for our assays since previous work has demonstrated that 5\u2032UTR sequence can be used for RV-C genotypic assignment at almost identical accuracy to the VP4/VP2 and VP1 and with superior clinical sensitivity (Lee et al., 2012). All assays demonstrated a broad dynamic range, high sensitivity, efficiency and performance in RV-C viral load determination with both clinical samples and in vitro RNA transcripts. Viral load in our respiratory samples were within the 1 \u00d7 103 and 1 \u00d7 1012 copies/mL range which is in concordance with previous publications (Li et al., 2010, Roussy et al., 2014, Schibler et al., 2012). All assays demonstrated high repeatability and reproducibility with CV of below 8% and 15% respectively. All assays were nonreactive with a range of other potential respiratory pathogens but cross-reactivity with other picornavirus species requires sequencing of the 5\u2032UTR to confirm RV-C identification prior to quantification. This was also needed to determine the appropriate primer-probe combination.",

            "text": "To accurately measure viral load in clinical samples it is vital that primers and probes are designed to match the target sequence. Indeed, previously published studies have shown that the positioning of the mismatch is a crucial determinant of probe binding affinity (Benovoy et al., 2008, Letowski et al., 2004) which may in turn impact upon the accuracy of the calculated viral load. Mismatches throughout or near the middle of the probe target region destabilize hybridization more than those near the ends (Letowski et al., 2004). Another recent study demonstrated that multiple mismatches in the probe target region may have a greater impact on accuracy than a single mismatch (Randhawa et al., 2011). This is consistent with our findings which showed that at most dilutions a single probe mismatch between assay probe and transcript material had minimal impact on accuracy but when multiple mismatches were present there was a substantial effect on viral load measurement across the dilution range. Together, these findings demonstrate the need for multiple qRT-PCR assays to achieve accurate RV-C loads for the different genotypes. However, we were able to show that this could be achieved with a small number of assays, requiring only four different probes to cover the 34 genotypes with known 5\u2032UTR sequences. It is anticipated that these four assays will cover more of the RV-C genotypes, but that awaits further sequence data.",

All of these genotypes were quantified at equal efficiencies in this study, suggesting that our assays can be used to accurately determine RV-C load of various genotypes from different geographical regions as well as to properly investigate differences in pathogenesis between RV-C genotypes. A limitation of the current method is it cannot reveal the presence of a mixed infection and therefore may not be able to accurately quantify the viral load of each genotype present.",
