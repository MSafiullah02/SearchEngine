Among the different COVID+ wards, we have to distinguish the intensive care unit and lower-intensity COVID+ wards. In the former, we have implemented maximum protective measures that allow the resuscitator to pass from one patient to another without changing too many items, while using the major PPE (gown, mask) for several hours, being mindful that changing clothes continuously could increase contagiousness. In the latter, only the most exposed staff (in direct contact with the patient) use maximum protective measures.

The decision to shut down all the other wards was taken because of the initial elevation of pneumonia cases requiring hospital assistance, and the parallel reduction in the number of hospitalizations for other non-COVID medical diseases.

General surgery emergency is actually 10% fewer less within the same period of the last year (February\u2013March 2019/February\u2013March 2020). Other hospitals have registered an increase in emergency operation, in contrary to our experience. The rationale for this difference, in our view, can be primarily explained by the fact that we are not a trauma center. At the same time, when possible we chose to treat in a more conservative way some surgical problems that usually may have been treated in a more direct and urgent surgical way, with the aim to limit the use of specialist staff and operating theater. This approach may be considered unfair because, even if we are living in an extraordinary contest, we do not have to miss good practice from guidelines and evidence-based medicine [7]. We underline that none of these decisions have been taken at the risk of reducing our patients\u2019 chance of survival, and we have always discussed cases in interdisciplinary meetings. We would like to remark the importance of making choices (medical, ethical and practical) to correctly use our mean to help patients with higher survival rates, especially in this historic time.",

This choice must be carefully analyzed in light of the consequences of all of those patients with chronic diseases (i.e., IBD, colon diverticulosis, gastric ulcer, HCC, etc.) and waiting for specialist surgical assessment and likely surgical approach to the disease. As a consequence of the reorganization set by government and each hospital management, it is realistic to imagine that limiting elective surgical activity may then lead to an explosion of emergency cases for the next few weeks, followed by a progressive return to normality [2].",

So, we have two different entrances to surgical unit and two different accesses to the operating room. After surgery, each operating theater underwent sanitation, considering all patients potentially COVID+. To keep our only surgical ward clean and COVID-free, if nasopharyngeal swab resulted positive before the patient\u2019s discharge from the surgical unit, they were hospitalized in COVID+ clinical ward and the surgeons could visit them there, with adequate clothing, for postoperative care. If the result was unavailable even after surgery, the patient was located in an isolation room within the surgical ward, until positivity or negativity could be ascertained. In order to protect inpatients to possible external contagion, visits from any relatives were forbidden. Medical staff would call them almost daily to provide updates on the recovery.",

This strategy was also chosen to delay surgery after the resolution of acute inflammation. The patient was discharged after the procedure, followed by our outpatient surgery. However, on April 14, the patient was hospitalized for relapse of abdominal pain and signs of gallbladder inflammation despite correct positioning of the drainage.

The estimated liver volumetry at first evaluation was 28%. The first step was performed on February 6, and postoperative course was complicated by nosocomial pneumonia. Histological examination confirmed colic cancer with hepatic secondary lesion in S3 (ypT3, ypN0, ypM1a).

In particular, this patient could be a candidate for temporary or definitive ileostomy or colostomy, a risky condition for elderly patient especially facing summer, not least chemotherapy. Medical and conservative treatment was started (intravenous hydration, nasogastric tube, electrolytes abnormalities correction), while complete preoperative examinations were performed with the aim to operate him as soon as possible in the best conditions. We performed a colonoscopy to see eventually other lesions and to place an endoscopic stent as bridge to surgery. Even if he was a really old patient, considering that he had no comorbidities and according to his relatives, we decide to perform delayed urgent surgery, without a fast-track postoperative protocol. Also thanks to the stenting procedure, we could perform an open left colectomy with end-to-end anastomosis without any stoma.

Her first hospitalization was due to abdominal fluid collection (7 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 8 cm) in hypogastric region in complicated diverticular disease, treated by percutaneous drainage with resolution, postponing a surgical treatment after a colonoscopy and adequate recovery. Unfortunately, for relapse of symptoms (fever and abdominal pain) the patient came back to ER only 2 weeks later. A new CT scan documented a relapse of the intra-abdominal abscess. Considering the history of the patient, an urgent surgical approach to the problem should be considered as the first choice. Since the involvement in the abscess of abdominal fascia and subcutaneous tissues, a high risk of postsurgical infection and/or dehiscence of abdominal wall was estimated, plus ICU recovery needed. For these reasons, we chose a conservative treatment through a new percutaneous drainage placement. Evaluation of nutritional status was done recognizing an important malnutrition state (MUST 2). Therefore, the patient was supported with parenteral nutrition (about 1600 kcal/die) and vitamins. Finally, the patient underwent elective surgical laparotomy intervention with intra-operative diagnosis of inflammatory pseudotumor of the sigmoid colon complicated by fistula and abscess. Left side colectomy with anastomosis was performed. Postoperative period was regular. In this case, conservative approach as the first step allowed to limit surgical risks, to upgrade nutritional assessment that was inadequate at the admission and to manage sepsis and general status avoiding ICU recovery after surgery.",

Following some recent publications, the laparotomic approach has to be preferred. Nevertheless, our group has chosen at first a mini-invasive approach to an open one, when it was possible. In particular, in order to reduce contamination from spreading of CO2 used for pneumoperitoneum, we introduce in our OR a device. It is a tube connected to one of the trocars, supplied by a filter at the extremity in order to drain out gas safety from the abdomen during laparoscopic procedures as Mintz et al. showed [10\u201312].",

Despite the adjustment and good maintenance, our hospitals are quite old buildings and often not easy to reorganize. So, it could be difficult to separate those two routes and keep them separated in hospitals. We think it would be more reasonable not to spilt a single hospital in two components, but rather to identify all the citizens and regional hospitals and divide them in \u201cCOVID+ Hub\u201d and \u201cCOVID-free Hub.\u201d",

However, since all the follow-up and screening programs have been stopped or delayed during the first phase of COVID-19 pandemic, we think the onset of an increase in surgical disease (benign and oncological) and also ER accesses due to them, with a consequential increase in the number of urgent surgical procedures, as a main effect of delayed diagnosis, is possible.",

More recent and well documented by scientists is the Spanish flu at the beginning of the twentieth century. Human beings survived all those pandemics, paying sometimes a big price, while making huge steps in knowledge. We think it is realistic that in the future we will come back to a normal life, clinical and surgical activity, probably without IPD (like surgical mask or gloves) required.
