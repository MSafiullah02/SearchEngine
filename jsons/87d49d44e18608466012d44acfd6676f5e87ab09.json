Hence, it is particularly important to organize management strategies for burn ward during the pandemic of Covid-19. This paper establishes some management strategies for burn ward based on our own experience and the Chinese national and international public health issues regarding ward management as well as the specific characteristics of the burn ward during the respiratory infectious diseases(1-2). 1. Management strategies of the administrational system in burn ward: 1.1 Establish and strengthen the managing team of epidemic prevention and control in each ward The new coronavirus infection is a major public health emergency, and each ward responds to the emergency under the guidance of the hospital emergency response system and the superior administrative agency in combination with its own features [3] . Based on the model of the ward's infection control team, the ward director and the head of nurse are responsible for the epidemic prevention and control team, the composition includes the medical chief in hospital, the nursing group leader, the clinical and laboratory infection control specialist, and the microbiology team. Each clinical diagnosis, nursing and recovery procedures will be conducted under the guidance of Chinese National Health Commission regarding Covid-19 prevention and management along with class A nosocomial infection requirements.",

Signs and instructive lines among three different zones should be clear and obvious. The emergency part in the ward was set up as a separate area for emergency treatment and admission of new patients. All new inpatients including pediatric burns will be isolated in a single room of the ward for 14 days without leaving the ward. Meanwhile, the severe burn patients should be admitted to BICU, who should be managed as a suspect of COVID-19 following the instruction of infectious disease specialists. After the new inpatients stay in the ward for more than 14 days excluded the suspection, the patients can be collected together and put into the ordinary ward. Public areas in the ward such as rehabilitation center, wound repair center and scar treatment center are only provided for patients who have been hospitalized for more than 14 days. New patients and emergency patients are treated in the ward accordingly and avoid any unnecessary prompt management.",

The food delivery system will deliver daily groceries and food to each individual. 3.1.1.2 Management of the caregivers for burns Only one caregiver in the ward is allowed to accompany each adult patient, two for pediatric patient. Temperature and registration will be conducted to each caregiver. Basically, caregivers are not allowed to go out of their rooms expect certain special conditions. In case that caregivers should go out from their rooms, the security and the nurses should be informed firstly and they should perform hand hygiene, face hygiene when they come back to their room. No visitors are allowed during the outbreak. Our ward delivers fully consistent remote video for visitors to reduce the emotional impact and minimize the risk of potential infection within family members [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . 3.1.1.3 Monitoring of vital signs of burn patients Staff should monitor body temperature, respiratory rhythm, frequency and depth, and blood oxygen saturation of the patients and their caregivers. At the same time, the consciousness and systemic symptoms, such as systemic muscle pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, etc., should be observed and recorded. Importantly, the respiratory symptoms including cough, sputum cough, chest tightness, dyspnea and cyanosis should be payed much attention to. For patients with assisted ventilation, parameters such as inspiratory pressure, expiratory pressure,oxygen concentration and others should be adjusted according to the doctor's advice.",
