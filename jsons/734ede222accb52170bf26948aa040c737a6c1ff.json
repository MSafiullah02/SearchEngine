To obtain plants transformed in the nuclear genome the natural capability of Agrobacterium tumefaciens to transfer DNA into plant cells (Tinland 1996) is amply exploited. By this method plant tissues can be transformed either in vitro, on small leaf explants, or directly in planta (Feldmann and Marks 1987; Bechtold and Pelletier 1998; Clough and Bent 1998) . But the transformation of plant species less susceptible to this pathogen (i.e. some monocots), can be also achieved by shooting DNA-coated tungsten or gold microbeads on plant tissues through a \"particle gun\" (biolistic method) (Taylor and Fauquet 2002) .",

Nonetheless, antigen production in plants still suffer some limitations of the nuclear transformation technology, basically due to the low and variable expression levels of the heterologous gene among independent lines. This is particularly detrimental when the direct oral delivery of the plant tissue is foreseen, as a precise a priori establishment of the vaccine dose is impracticable. A step taken to face this problem consists in optimizing the heterologous gene sequence by using host codon usage, removing cryptic genetic signals that can negatively affect post-translational steps and targeting the heterologous protein in appropriate subcellular compartments ensuring proper folding identifying suitable 5' and 3' regulatory elements able to ensure reproducible high-level and tissue-specific transgene expression, as it has been shown that the activity of nominally constitutive promoters can vary as a function of the developmental stage, organ and plant species (Williamson et al. 1989; Malik et al. 2002; Samac et al. 2004) . Recently, new plant-derived regulatory sequences, such as the promoter-terminator (Sullivan and Green 1993; Koziel et al. 1996 Gomez et al. 1998; Tuboly et al. 2000 ; Streatfield et al. 2001 In bold characters are indicated references describing clinical trials of the plantexpressed antigens.",

However, recent approaches converted this procedure into a valuable alternative expression system. For example, Icon Genetics Inc. (recently acquired by Bayer) has developed a system (magnICON) for the overexpression of foreign genes that conjugates the efficiency of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation with viral rate of expression Gils et al. 2005) . The strategy is based on the optimization of the TMV genome (by the removal of cryptic sequence that, if recognized by the plant machineries, could affect viral replication/spreading) and on the split of the improved genome into 5' and 3' modules of expression. The 5' module includes the viral polymerase and the movement proteins genes while the 3' module carries the gene of interest in substitution of the viral coat protein gene. These two modules, used to co-infiltrate plants, are linked together by a recombinase encoded by a third co-infiltrated vector that recognizes specific recombinase target-sequences, artificially added to each module. This \"deconstructed\" virus system that lacks the coat protein gene, is unable to spread throughout the plant and in the environment, is not influenced by the dimension of the inserted gene due to the absence of the packaging process, while leads the plant cell machinery to the production of the heterologous protein. Using this strategy high levels of different Yersinia pestis antigens have been expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. These plant-produced antigens are efficient in inducing protective immune responses against the pathogen when administered subcutaneously to guinea pigs (Santi et al. 2006 ). ",

The use of synthetic peptides corresponding in their sequence to linear epitopes has been considered for the development of safe vaccines. Unfortunately, the efficacy of peptides in the induction of an immune response is limited mainly because of their very short half-life in the serum. Several delivery systems have been designed to circumvent this limitation. An attractive approach to produce epitope-based plant vaccines is the construction of chimeric plant viruses displaying on the surface of the assembled particles peptides of interest for vaccine formulations (Pogue et al. 2002) . By this approach, plants are employed as biofactories and large scale \"reservoirs\" of chimeric virus particles (CVPs) carrying the epitope. To construct CVPs, the sequence coding for the heterologous peptide is fused to the viral coat protein (CP) gene in a position known to be exposed on viral surface (Johnson et al. 1997; Porta and Lomonossoff 1998) . To guarantee the production of large quantities of CVPs, the structural and functional characterization of the CP is essential to place the foreign peptide avoiding the interference with viral assembly, stability and/or spreading through the plant. To this aim, fundamental are the studies that define the biochemical factors governing viral movement and CP/virus particle structures by mutational, immunological and X-ray diffraction/spectro-metry analysis (Carrington et al. 1996; Callaway et al. 2001; Bendahmane et al. 1999; Porta et al. 2003) .",

The most known plant-derived adjuvants are saponins and in particular the QS21 acylated 3,28-o-bisdesmodic triterpene saponin extracted from the bark of the South American tree Quillaja saponaria Molina (Jacobsen et al. 1996) . Basically, the interest to this natural surfactant derives from its high water solubility and the stability (hours if not days) of the mixture with the antigen preparation. Delivered in combination with different antigens not only in several animal models, but also in human trials, QS-21 has been able to enhance both Th1and Th2 responses (Moore et al. 1999) and to favor the activation of cytotoxic T cells (Newman et al. 1997) . Besides QS-21 and new variants of natural or semi-synthetic saponins (da Silva et al. 2005; Marciani et al. 2003 ), a broad range of different plantderived compounds, such as the Neem tree Leaf Preparation (NLP) (Baral et al. 2005) , a compound of Chinese herbal medicinal ingredients (cCHMIs) and the Rb1 fraction of ginseng (Rivera et al. 2005) , is under investigation to evaluate adjuvanticity. Some of these compounds together with molecules, such as triterpenoids (Squalene is at the moment the sole adjuvant, together with alum, approved for human use) (Singh and O'Hagan 1999; Stephenson et al. 2005 ) are as effective as Freund's complete or incomplete adjuvant, and able to induce balanced Th1 and Th2 immune responses and active immunity even towards tumor antigens (Baral et al. 2005) .",

Mucosal immunizations, for example, represent an efficient alternative to traditional parenteral immunization, inducing not only secretory IgA responses, but also systemical antibody production and T-cell mediated immunity (Holmgren and Czerkinsky 2005) . Moreover, this non-invasive, easy-delivered immunization procedure is performed without the use of needles thus preventing cross-contamination. Plant-derived antigens both stably and transiently expressed in edible tissues/organs have been delivered orally and the efficiency of this immunization procedure has been evaluated in terms of antibody production. In this context, chimeric plant virus particles offer interesting solutions to the problem of peptide-vaccine efficacy for two main reasons. They are functional carriers for peptide-delivery and have been demonstrated to be efficient immune response-inducers without the need of adjuvant both when delivered in purified form (Marusic et al. 2001) or when orally administered in infected plant tissues (Yusibov et al. 2002) . Studies have been carried out in order to define the fate of CVPs in vivo, by investigating the distribution in mice of CPMV particles orally or intravenously delivered (Rae et al. 2005) . The conclusion was that these icosahedric virions, that are the best characterized to be used as nanoparticles (Wang et al. 2002a (Wang et al. , 2002b Chatterji et al. 2004) , are stable during transit in the gastrointestinal tract being able to disseminate systemically thereafter. CPMV particles were found in several tissues throughout the body, supporting the idea that they can be used also as orally bioavailable nanocapsule for the delivery of vaccines and more generally of therapeutics.",
