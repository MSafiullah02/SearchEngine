            "text": "The 5\u2032 end of nascent eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA) is co-transcriptionally modified by the addition of a cap structure. The cap-0 structure consists of a guanosine linked by a 5\u2032\u20135\u2032 triphosphate bridge to the RNA 5\u2032 end (Figure 1\na). This cap structure is methylated at the nitrogen in position 7 of G (cap-0 structure or m7\nGpppN). In metazoan, cap-0 is often converted into cap-1 structure by 2\u2032-O-methylation of the first N1 ribose (cap-1 structure or m7\nGpppN2\u2032m) of the mRNA. This structure plays several key biological functions (reviewed in Ref. [1\u2022\u2022]). The cap (i) increases mRNA stability by protecting mRNA from 5\u2032 exoribonucleases; (ii) participates to pre-mRNA splicing and export to the cytoplasm; (iii) ensures the recruitment of mRNA to the ribosomes by recognizing eukaryotic translation Initiation Factor (eIF4E); and (iv) initiates the translation of mRNA into proteins. In addition, it was demonstrated that the cap structure is a marker of \u2018self\u2019, preventing detection by mechanisms of cellular innate immunity [2]. It was first reported that host cell sensors, such as Toll Like Receptor (TLR) and Retinoic acid-Inducible Gene (RIG)-like receptors, could detect uncapped RNAs with 5\u2032-triphosphate ends. More recently, it was also shown that RIG-I and Melanoma Differentiation-Associated protein 5 (MDA5) recognize mis-capped RNA lacking 2\u2032-O-methylation of the first transcribed nucleotide [3, 4] initiating signaling cascades leading to the expression and release of cytokines and type I interferon. In turn, interferon induces an antiviral state in neighboring cells. Among the Interferon-Stimulated Genes (ISG), InterFeron-Induced protein with Tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT 1) can recognize mis-capped RNAs and inhibit their translation [5].",

The phosphate at the 5\u2032 end of the nascent viral is hydrolyzed by an RTPase activity held by an RTPase or a helicase domain. Concomitantly, a GTP is recruited by a GTPase, often forming a covalent adduct Lys-GMP before the transfer of GMP onto the RNA 5\u2032 diphosphate end [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. This occurs for DNA viruses (e.g., poxviruses, mimivirus, baculoviruses) as well as supposedly for several positive strand RNA viruses (e.g., flavivirus, coronavirus). After capping, the cap is methylated on its N7 and 2\u2032O position by either one bi-functional N7/2\u2032O-MTases (e.g., flaviviruses [12, 13]), or two separate enzymes (e.g., coronaviruses [14]).",

In Orthomyxoviridae and Bunyaviridae, the cellular mRNA is cleaved 10\u201320 nucleotides downstream from the cap structure by a viral endonuclease [19, 20\u2022\u2022, 21, 22\u2022\u2022].

This is the case in plant, fungi, protozoans, and DNA viruses (mimivirus, poxviruses, baculoviruses have 2 distinct TPases), with the so-called Triphosphate Tunnel Metallo-enzymes (TTM) superfamily [11, 25]. The metal-dependent active-site lies at the bottom of a tunnel, the shape of which seems well-suited to accommodate specific inhibitors exhibiting binding affinities in the nanomolar range [26\u2022]. The third and fourth type are those of Reoviridae, which also have their genuine 5\u2032-RTPase: the HIT-like family of Rotavirus, an octamer of the NSP2, and the so-called RNA cap assembly line, a large enzyme complex encompassing VP4 and \u03bb2 of Bluetongue and mammalian orthoreovirus, respectively [27, 28]. The RNA cap assembly line represents a model of concealing nascent viral RNA and compaction of a chemical reaction sequence. In the last, fifth type, hydrolysis of the RNA 5\u2032-\u03b3-phosphate is achieved by the \u2018engine\u2019 of the viral helicase whose NTPase active site is also able to accommodate the 5\u2032-pppRNA [29]. This NTPase active site incorporates a DEAD/H sequence (Walker B motif) and is responsible for fueling the helicase movement along RNA. An inhibitor at this site should therefore be bi-functional, killing both helicase and RTPase/capping activities. However, probably due to the highly dynamic nature of the helicase enzyme, few potent inhibitors have been reported so far [30].",

Details of guanine-cap acquisition also remain elusive for the large flavivirus genus, as well as the whole Nidovirales order (Coronaviridae, Arteriviridae, \u2026). In flaviviruses, a putative covalent GMP-MTase domain adduct has been proposed. Since the putative catalytic lysine with its \u03b5-NH2 is not conserved, the covalent adduct to NS5 remains questionable. For flaviviruses (and perhaps Nidovirales), it may well be that specific 5\u2032-RNA sequences, which are required to express the N7-MTase, are essential elements to catalyze cap addition without any covalent intermediate.",

            "text": "The methylation of the cap involves two activities: the N7-MTase that transfers a methyl group on the cap guanosine residue and the RNA 2\u2032O-MTase which methylates the ribose of the N1 residue of the cap structure. Despite their highly divergent sequences, most MTases harbor a canonical Rossman fold with a S-adenosyl methionine (SAM, methyl donor) binding pocket, an RNA- and/or cap-binding site and a catalytic site [32]. The SAM is usually maintained in close proximity of the catalytic site by a conserved D-X-G motif. The 2\u2032O MTases have been shown to harbor a conserved K-D-K-E catalytic tetrad, which participates to substrate positioning for an in-line SN2 methyl transfer reaction where the methyl on the sulfur atom of SAM serves as the electrophile that undergoes attack by the activated 2\u2032 oxygen of the RNA substrate [33]. SAM is converted to S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH) during this process. In contrast, the N7-MTase mechanism remains elusive as catalysis does not involve a tetrad of residues easily identified in protein sequences. Some virus families code for two different MTase domains carrying a cap-binding site (e.g., poxviruses [11], coronaviruses [14, 34, 35]) involved in N7- or 2\u2032O-methylation of the cap structure. In contrast, other virus groups (e.g., flaviviruses, Mononegavirales) have evolved one MTase domain harboring both N7- and 2\u2032O-MTase activities [12, 15, 36\u2022\u2022]. Cap methylation thus implies a step of RNA repositioning allowing the presentation of either the guanine N7 position or the 2\u2032O position of the first transcribed nucleotide in close vicinity to the SAM methyl donor. As the N7 methylation is essential for viral mRNA translation into protein and the cap 2\u2032O methylation limits viral RNA detection by RIG-like sensors, such MTases bear potential as new antiviral targets [37\u2022\u2022].",

Whereas most viral MTases can be inhibited by SAM analogues such as sinefungin, it is likely that more specific inhibitors can be discovered upon structure\u2013activity relationship analysis (Figure 3). Accordingly, some SAM mimetics accommodating specifically an unique hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the SAM-binding site in flavivirus MTases inhibit Dengue virus replication [38]. In addition, docking experiments indicate that those compounds might bind to the highly homologous MTase of Zika virus (ZIKV) [39]. A second possibility to develop specific inhibitors is illustrated by fragment-based drug design approaches. Using this approach, allosteric inhibitors targeting DENV and ZIKV MTases in vitro were recently reported, but their median inhibitory activity remain in the 10\u201350 \u03bcM range [39]. Additionally, using a virtual screening approach, ten potential inhibitors of the ZIKV MTase were sorted out of 28341 compounds. Even if these compounds were not yet demonstrated to limit the MTase activity in vitro, they show antiviral activity in ZIKV-infected cells with EC50 ranging from 4 to 17 \u03bcM. Thus it is likely that molecular docking can be used to target conserved \u2018druggable\u2019 sites and design-specific MTase inhibitors [40]. A third possibility has emerged with MTases activated by a protein partner (e.g., coronaviruses), for which peptidomimetics have been reported as specific inhibitors [41]. Finally, it is also possible to down-regulate the MTase activity level by modulating the intracellular SAM/SAH balance using 3-deazaneplanocin, an SAH hydrolase inhibitor [42]. This strategy was successfully used to inhibit Ebola virus replication in mice, although the latter inhibitor might also have an effect on interferon production [43, 44].",

In contrast to most viral MTases, nsP1 uses GTP rather than a cap structure as a substrate. The GTP is thus first methylated at its N7 position (m7GTP). The m7GTP then forms a covalent link (m7GMP-nsP1) with the catalytic histidine of nsP1, releasing inorganic pyrophosphate [16, 17, 18\u2022] (Figure 2b). The methylated GMP is subsequently transferred onto the nascent viral RNA yielding a cap-0 structure. Although no structural data are yet available for any nsP1, the uniqueness of this unconventional capping reaction makes it an attractive target for antiviral drug design. Recently small molecule inhibitors of alphavirus nsP1 were reported to block CHIKV replication in the \u03bcM range (2\u201326 \u03bcM, Figure 3) [45\u2022\u2022]. By selecting resistant viruses, it was demonstrated that the guanylyltransferase activity was the target.",

Whereas GTases bind GMP covalently and accept a 5\u2032-diphosphate RNA, PRNTases bind 5\u2032-monophosphate RNA and accept GDP (Figure 2a). Both pathways lead to the same end product, the RNA cap-0. One could think that the chemistry underlying covalent attachment of GMP or pRNA would be related, since GTP and 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA are structurally related and both receive a nucleophilic attack at their \u03b1-phosphate. However, GTases bind GMP through a \u03b5-lysil-phosphoramidate intermediate [10], whereas PRNTases bind 5\u2032-monophosphate RNA through a N\u03b52-histidine intermediate [46]. Furthermore, the protein folding of GTases and PRNTases does not show any obvious homology, suggesting that this covalent attachment promoting a ping-pong mechanism has been invented twice during evolution. From the drug design point of view, GTases might be difficult to inhibit with high selectivity. Indeed, they belong to the large family of DNA ligases [31], whose structure and activity is largely represented in the mammalian world. PRNTases are uniquely represented in NNS viruses. The activity has been demonstrated in Rhabdoviridae only so far, but PRNTase-like domains have been identified in many other NNS virus families such as Paramyxoviridae, Pneumoviridae, Filoviridae, to name a few families of significant medical interest. Recent progress in structural determination of these enzymes at atomic resolution [47\u2022\u2022] should greatly stimulate drug design in the near future.",

The endonuclease belongs to the PD-D/ExK superfamily of cation-dependent nucleases, in which lysine is the main catalytic residue. The acidic D and D/E residues coordinate two metal ions, together with a histidine residue conserved in Orthomyxoviridae and Bunyaviridae enzymes, or replaced by a third acidic residue in Arenaviridae [22\u2022\u2022]. All these endonucleases share a common two-metal-ions mechanism, with distinct metal preferences though, and this feature can be exploited for drug design as the active site environment shows some virus-specific structural variation. Metal chelators have shown their \u2018druggability\u2019, such as raltegravir and related pharmacophores, in the case of inhibition of the HIV integrase. It is indeed possible to chelate the metals at the enzyme active site while obtaining target specificity through occupancy of the unique active site environment [48]. Hence, metal chelators, such as 2,4-dioxo-4-phenylbutanoic acid (DPBA) that acts as bunyavirus and orthomyxovirus endonuclease inhibitor, may provide a pharmacophoric motif to design more potent compounds.",

However, the past research decade has a contrario unveiled that RNA capping is essential for virus replication, and is in fact a most interesting target for the design of potent antivirals due to two main reasons: (i) incomplete/inhibited RNA capping triggers a potent host immune response adding up to direct inhibition of viral gene expression, and (ii) structural and functional studies of viral capping enzymes have revealed a profound uniqueness of the viral enzymes involved, which shows promises to achieve high drug selectivity.

Several MTase inhibitors have been reported: Ribavirin 5\u2032-triphosphate ([58], reported in the GTase panel) and the SAM/SAH analogue Sinefungin are inhibitors of several viral MTases in vitro and SAH analogues derivative (compound 10) also inhibit more specifically the flaviviral MTase [38]. Non-nucleosidic inhibitors, obtained by a fragment-based drug-design approach targeting the flaviviral MTase (Dengue and Zika virus) have also been reported recently [39, 59]. Virtual screening was also used to identify dengue MTase inhibitors (NSC series) [60] against Zika virus (F3043-0013 and F0922-0796) [40]. Compounds regulating the SAH/SAM balance such as 3-deazaneplanocine A show potent broad-spectrum antiviral activity, including Ebola virus (see text). This antiviral effect is supposedly linked to inhibition of their MTase through increase of the SAH pool. The chemical structures of representative EndoN inhibitors are shown; most of them have been crystallized within the active site of the influenza virus PA enzyme [51]. Cap analogues exemplified here with m7GTP, and several inhibitors of cap-binding protein have been identified through X-ray structure analysis of the influenza virus PB2-CBD in complex with the corresponding ligands. For RO0794238, direct binding to the PB2-CBD could not be demonstrated [52]. The VX-787 corresponds to a highly potent Influenza PB2 inhibitor [53] 1.",
