Mixing rates vary by modes of transmission and by disease. The contact rate for a vector-borne disease depends on hosts being bitten by vectors and consequently, it is dependent both on host-related and vector-related factors. The mixing rate for an STI is the number of potentially infectious sexual contacts an individual has. This can be affected by a multitude of factors including condom use, etc. For other directly transmitted diseases, the mixing rate may be harder to quantify and depend on specific disease-related factors such as how long infectious particles remain in the air or stay alive on surfaces, and environmental factors such as humidity (Caroline Breese Hall, 2007, Bean et al., 1982, Karim et al., 1985, Miller and Artenstein, 1967, Kao and Yang, 2006).",

For a vector-borne disease, such as malaria, heterogeneity in the mixing rate is often a result of host-related factors, such as differential attractiveness to mosquitoes (e.g. Port et al., 1980, Shirai et al., 2004, Lindsay et al., 2000) or the use of bed nets (Lengeler et al., 2004). Heterogeneity in the mixing rate for sexually transmitted infections can be affected by including rate of sexual partner change, sexual practices (Joseph Hotz Avner Ahituv and Philipson, 1996), and access to condoms (Chimbindi et al., 2010, MacPhail et al., 2009, Bassett and Mhloyi, 1991, Pettifor et al., 2004). For directly transmitted diseases, contacts are often harder to define, and heterogeneity arises from a mixture of host, pathogen, and environmental factors. Heterogeneity in the mixing rate can be further broken down into the mixing rate of infected individuals and the mixing rate of susceptible individuals. Here, we assume that individuals have an intrinsic mixing rate that does not change with infection status.",

For example, vector-borne and sexually transmitted diseases involve symmetric contact (both the susceptible and infected individual need to be bitten by a vector, or to have sexual intercourse to transmit disease), whereas food-borne illnesses often involve asymmetric contact (food workers infect food consumers, but not the other way around). Ebola virus disease is an example where behavior is changed by disease: effective mixing rates of well people depend on how likely they are to be involved in care-giving, and likely vary less than the effective mixing rates of infectious people.

Since the finite-population reproductive numbers are limited by the size of the population whereas the infinite reproductive numbers are not, the finite-population reproductive numbers diverge from their corresponding infinite population reproductive number as R0 approaches the size of the population. Where they diverge depends on both the distribution and the coefficient of variation of that distribution; although where the finite-population reproductive numbers depend on these factors, the finite-population reproductive number with CV=3 diverges around 1/5 N whereas the homogeneous finite-population reproductive number diverges around 1/2 N. Further, for heterogeneity in intrinsic mixing, the heterogeneous finite-population reproductive numbers are larger than the homogeneous finite-population reproductive number when R0 is small relative to the size of the population and the heterogeneous finite-population reproductive numbers are smaller than the homogeneous finite-population reproductive number when R0 is large relative to the size of the population. For gamma distributed heterogeneity, this occurs between 1/3 N and 3/4 N (Fig. 2(a)) and at around N for log-normally distributed heterogeneity (Fig. B3). For the other four types of heterogeneity, the homogeneous finite-population reproductive number is always larger than the heterogeneous finite-population reproductive numbers (Fig. 12\n).",

            "text": "\nSmith et al. (2007) considered only heterogeneity in attractiveness to mosquitoes. Here, we consider five different types of heterogeneity: the four simple types outlined in the Section 1.1 and heterogeneity in the mixing rate of both susceptible and infected individuals (the last corresponds to Smith\u05f3s assumptions). We find simple expressions for each of the five finite-population reproductive numbers in terms of the distribution of heterogeneity and the size of the population.",

Fig. 3, Fig. 5, Fig. 7, Fig. 9, Fig. 11 show the effect of the distribution on the finite-population reproductive numbers for a fixed coefficient of variation (CV=2). While the distribution of heterogeneity for a fixed CV affects the finite-population reproductive numbers, the CV has a larger effect on how much the finite-population reproductive number is changed due to heterogeneity. Fig. 2, Fig. 4, Fig. 6, Fig. 8, Fig. 10, Fig. B3, Fig. B2 show the effect of the coefficient of variation on the finite-population reproductive numbers. For very small values of the CV, the finite-population reproductive numbers converge on the homogeneous finite-population reproductive number; as CV increases, so does the effect of heterogeneity.",
