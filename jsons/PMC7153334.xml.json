DNA is also increasingly being used to organize other nanomaterials, and the related field of RNA nanotechnology is beginning to emerge\u201d [6].

The most used in optical (bio)sensors are oxidized graphene derivatives, which undergo a recombination of electron\u2013hole pairs localized within an sp2 carbon domain embedded within an sp3 matrix, thus resulting in characteristic photoluminescent properties.

Morales-Narv\u00e1ez and coworkers used antibody/QD (Ab-QD) probes and GO to design a pathogen-detection microarray [16]. This sensing principle is based on the energy-transfer phenomenon that occurs between photoexcited QDs and GO when in close proximity. In the absence of the pathogen, the Ab-QD probes extensively interact through \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking with GO, which quenches their fluorescence. When the pathogens are selectively captured by the Ab-QD probes, they fluoresce when excited with a laser, since a weaker interaction occurs with GO that, in this configuration, is not more capable of strong fluorescence quenching. As a model pathogen to test the system, Escherichia coli O157:H7.16 was used, while QDs were (core-shell) CdSe@ZnS QDs functionalized with streptavidin. This biosensing approach led to a highly specific and sensitive analysis, noticeable up to 10 CFU mL\u22121 in standard buffer and 100 CFU mL\u22121 in bottled water and milk.",

Yoon et al. [30] covalently conjugated the periplasmic glucose-binding protein from E. coli with carboxylated poly(vinyl alcohol)-wrapped SWNTs, leading to allosterically controlled optical transduction by reversible exciton quenching in response to glucose. Glucose-binding protein is characterized by two domains linked by a \u201chinge\u201d region; it binds the sugar with very high specificity undergoing a conformational change in which the two domains close around the glucose. This actuation resulted in changes of the polymer\u2013SWCNT interaction, ultimately causing a highly selective and reversible SWCNT fluorescent quenching, proportional to the glucose concentration. Changes in fluorescence emission of glucose-binding protein/SWNTs were analyzed at different glucose concentrations, over a long observation time (>60 h), thanks to the photostability of SWNT.",

Before 2010, few articles have been reported for the application of CB as electrode modifier for analyte detection in solution. Only after 2010 there was a relevant growth of publication number describing CB as electrode nanomodifier. Our group highlighted the mesmerizing electrochemical characteristics of CB in the ink/paste as well as in modifying electrodes by drop-casting to reveal many analytes as catechol, hydrogen peroxide, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), and thiocholine [32], [33], [34], [35]. Our results were validated by other groups: Compton\u2019s group [36] reported the gain of using CB over the more specialized MWCNTs in terms of sensitivity toward the detection of nicotine by adsorbitive stripping voltammetry, because the presence of CB allowed higher current responses for nicotine oxidation at lower potentials. Pumera\u2019s group [37] demonstrated that CB is more suitable than the thermally reduced GO, being cheaper and not requiring any chemical and physical treatment before use. Fatibello-Filho\u2019s group [38] as well as Evtugyn\u2019s group [39] successfully used CB-modified electrodes for the detection of different analytes. Arduini et al. [35] reported a miniaturized and disposable electrochemical sensor for phenolic compound detection constructed by modifying the working electrode surface of SPEs with CB dispersion (Fig. 13.7A\n). This sensor showed higher sensitivity and better resistance to fouling than the bare SPE, displaying the suitability of CB as an excellent electrode nanomodifier. Catechol, gallic acid, caffeic acid, and tyrosol were detected by square-wave voltammetry with detection limits of 0.1, 1, 0.8, and 2 \u03bcM, respectively.",

To this aim, carbon nanomaterials are good candidates for biosensor configuration as smart quenchers. Morales-Narv\u00e1ez and coworkers [41] explored the ability of different carbon nanomaterials as quencher in comparison with the most used QDs for FRET measurements. In this regard, the authors exploited QDs as donors and graphite, CNTs, CNFs, and GO as energy acceptors of FRET from QDs. The responses of the explored carbon-based materials as acceptors of QD FRET donors in the proposed platform are displayed in Fig. 13.8\n. They observed that graphite was a weak acceptor for spots deposited from high concentration suspensions (0.5\u20131 mg mL\u22121), while for thinner films at graphite lower concentrations (0.125\u20130.25 mg mL\u22121), graphite becomes a strong acceptor. Both CNT and CNF in general behave as stronger acceptors in comparison to graphite, whereas, as observed, the strongest quenching is caused by GO at all the studied concentration values (from 0.125 to 1 mg GO mL\u22121).",

The role of AuNPs was dual: they served as anchor points for the attachment of the thiol-extremity of the DNA probe, and they produced an obvious improvement of the electrochemical properties compared to unmodified graphite-based printed electrodes. AuNPs allowed, at a very low cost of production, to reach detection limit of 3 and 7 nM, respectively, for ss and ds sequences.

On the contrary, the use of AgNPs is particularly effective when an electrochemical label is needed. Many examples are reported within the field of electrochemistry. For instance, AgNPs together with graphene have been used to develop a novel trace label for the development of a clinical immunosensor for avian influenza virus H7 [50]. In order to produce a stable adduct, a chitosan solution has been added to provide carboxylic groups (after NaOH treatment) for the conjugation with H7-polyclonal antibodies, making a biohybrid conjugate. Taking advantage of the high surface-to-volume ratio of graphene, a high amount of AgNPs has been immobilized, and allowed to improve the sensitivity of the final platform by detecting the virus with a detection limit of 1.6 pg mL\u22121 and a four-orders linearity range (up to 16 ng mL\u22121).

This proof-of-concept approach allowed reaching high sensitivities down to 102 CFU mL\u22121 in only 10 min. However, this assay was not able to distinguish and quantify different bacterial strains in complex mixtures and the presence of interfering species such as copper and mercury, lead to an electrochemical quenched effect due to suspected formation of alloys and amalgams between these cations (Cu2+, Hg2+) and the noble metals, Au and Ag, constituting the NSs, as reported in Fig. 13.9B.",

The dissolution of AuNPs represents a new mechanism: in fact, they can be dissolved by a mild oxidant in the presence of CTAB, exhibiting an evident shift from red to colorless. In this case, when the enzymatic substrate (acetylthiocoline) is converted by AChE, the by-product thiocholine protects AuNPs from dissolution; instead, when the inhibitor is present, the enzymatic reaction does not occur properly, AuNPs are oxidized to Au3+/CTAB and the color changes from red to pink/colorless.

Recently, AuNPs have been integrated into a paper-based immunoassay strip for the detection of uranium in groundwater [67]. The mechanism of the detection is founded on the fact that a monoclonal antibody (clone 12F6) is capable to specifically recognizes U(VI) when complexed to a chelator, the 2,9-dicarboxyl-1,10-phenanthroline (DCP). To reveal U(VI) complex, AuNPs have been conjugated to the antibody and due to the small size of the U-DCP complex, a competitive assay was realized. With this approach, a limit of detection of ~37 nM has been obtained and it should be noted that this result well meets the legal limit of 126 nM set by the WHO and the US EPA for drinking water.",

The main reason is attributable to the starting color of AgNPs: in fact, differently from the red-based color of AuNPs, the color of AgNPs is usually yellowish. Moreover, the use of AgNPs is reported in literature particularly due to the simplicity in synthesis and to the low cost of the precursors. Recently, Peng et al. developed a method for the detection of ascorbic acid by taking into consideration the growth of AgNPs following a green photo-catalytic route [68]. Briefly, Ag nanoclusters (AgNCs) are obtained by two steps: UV-mediated photosynthesis of NCs with papain and catalytic growth of AgNPs in the presence of ascorbic acid. The difference between the NCs and NPs is in the color; while the former is colorless, the latter is yellow. The NCs represent the catalyst for promoting the synthesis of AgNPs, with an associated change of the plasmon absorption spectra at 420 nm. With this procedure, ascorbic acid has been detected in the range comprised between 0.25 and 50 \u03bcM, with a limit of detection as low as ~79 nM (using a spectrophotometer), while the detection limit observed for colorimetric assays taken by the photographs was ~1 \u03bcM.",

In 2016, CuNPs have been produced by using the fatty acid amide N-lauryltyramine and hydrazine as capping and reducing agent, respectively [70].

They observed that the color change happened only when both the thiol (SH) and amine (NH2) groups were present in the analyte: CuNPs detected Cys after 2 min while 3 h were necessary to sense l-cysteine ethyl ester (CEE). This behavior can be attributed to the bulkier size of CEE, which may have delayed the contact of SH and NH2 group with CuNPs.

The assay involved the hybridization of a target sequence with its complementary probe sequence, followed by the addition of hybrid nanocomposite PtNPs/rGO.

After centrifugation, the addition of tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and hydrogen peroxide leads to an intense blue color. Instead, if the level of target is high, the target/probe duplex can be formed, making the nanocomposite aggregated and thus reducing the recovered PtNPs/rGO after centrifugation; the result is a pale blue production upon the addition of TMB and hydrogen peroxide.

Having in mind this mechanism, Bagheri and colleagues developed the first paper-based multiplatform highlighting the fading of Prussian Blue for sensing the enzymatic activity [65], as reported in Fig. 13.10D.

Liu et al. prepared a nanocomposite made with ceria nanorods and 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-carboxyl phenyl)-porphyrin (H2TCPP), namely H2TCPP\u2013CeO2\n[72]. This nanocomposite exhibited an intrinsic peroxidase-like activity toward hydrogen peroxide and TMB similarly to horseradish peroxidase enzyme. The combination of these two materials led to a synergistic effect: the electrons can be easily transferred from the conduction band of porphyrin to the conduction band ceria due to the lower level of CeO2 than that of porphyrin. In the presence of glucose oxidase, the reported approach was capable to detect glucose down to 3.3\u00d710\u22125\n M within a dynamic range between 5.0\u00d710\u22125 and 1.0\u00d710\u22124\n M. However, as for the previous section, the use of this nanocomposite in majority is related to its enzyme-like activity.",

In terms of application, they are still at a proof-of-concept stage of tiny objects demonstrating capabilities to autonomously perform different tasks: transporting cargo, destroying cells, remediate pollution. In this direction, the integration of nano/micro entities within electroanalytical and colorimetric devices is highly recommendable. The first combination of micromotors with a SPE has been reported, using Mg-Au-Ni Janus microengines for accelerated destruction of nerve agents, and consequent detection of the non-hazardous remediated product (p-nitrophenol) [76]. In this work, smart micromotors were capable of producing OH\u2212 ions to increase the pH of the medium and consequently promote the alkaline degradation of paraoxon into a readily detectable p-nitrophenol, Fig. 13.11A\n. In addition, the produced H2 allowed obtaining a rapid and reproducible nerve-agent degradation with a subsequent detection without the need of external stirrers or mixing devices. The use of microengines leads to a 15-fold increased sensitivity toward organophosphate pesticide detection, compared to a nonengineered SPE. This combined platform represented the first example of an alternative built-in mixing in electroanalysis.",

In just 15 min, the catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (the fuel) caused by the MnO2 catalytic layer resulted in the production of O2 bubbles along with hydroxyl radicals for analytes dimerization.

The use of nanosized materials belonging from carbonaceous, metallic, or inorganic sources confers to the realized devices improved characteristics of cost-effectiveness, high sensitivity and selectivity, lowest limit of detection, and long-term stability. As illustrated, these NPs are suitable to be combined with each other and/or with different biological elements, producing new nanocomposites always with enhanced performances. Their use also permits for the miniaturization of the platforms, allowing for the realization of wearable devices for the real-time monitoring of physiological parameters. In addition, the miniaturization of platforms paves the way for coupling them with another emerging field: the wearable electronics. The wearable technology market actually shows a very fast growth, being currently worth $30 billion and predicted to rise to $150 billion by 2026, including an expected compound annual growth rate of 32% for wearable chemical sensors for the next 10 years, as stated by the report \u201cWearable Technology 2016-2026: IDTechEx\u201d, June 30, 2016 [79]. In our opinion, this field represents one of the future aspects of the research in sensing devices, which requires a strict synergy between different expertizes such as those of chemical, engineering, materials, and biological areas, boosting the multifarious vision of science.",
