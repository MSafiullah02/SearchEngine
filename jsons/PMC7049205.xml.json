            "text": "Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are the principal causes of infection among critically ill patients in intensive care units (ICU) [1]. Among all such cases of nosocomial pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus is the second most prevalent pathogen (17.8%), with 29.9% of the isolates in Europe being oxacillin-resistant [2]. The changing epidemiology of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nosocomial infections, the decreasing susceptibility to first-line antibiotics, such as vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA), linezolid resistant MRSA [3], and community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) leave clinicians with few therapeutic options. In this context, an accurate description of the mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance in MRSA nosocomial pneumonia in ICU could help in the design of novel therapies. Knowledge of resistance-related phenotypic and genotypic changes is critical for the development of new drugs. When designing a new antibiotic, the previously described resistance mechanisms must be taken into account. The new antimicrobial should be able to overcome the resistance mechanisms, or should be aimed at new targets where the probability that the microorganism has developed resistance is lower [4].",

Our sequence types were distributed in four clonal complexes: CC5 included ST8, ST83, ST403 and ST1221; CC22 included ST22, ST217, and ST954; CC45 included only ST45; and CC59 included only ST87 (Fig. 3). In addition, ST1535 was distributed as a singleton. The strains isolated at the Hospital Cl\u00ednic were distributed in the four clonal complexes, while the strains at the Hospital del Mar and at the Hospital of Milan were distributed in clonal complexes CC5 and CC22. The most frequent clonal complexes were CC22 and CC5, which accounted for 55 and 30% of local MRSA strains respectively.\n\n",

At the participating ICUs, S. aureus was not found to be resistant to first-line antibiotics such as linezolid and vancomycin. Although the prevalence of MRSA in the participating centres was low, the mechanisms of resistance described may also be representative for sites with high MRSA prevalence because the MRSA collected during this study corresponded to highly disseminated clonal complexes (CC22 and CC5). In addition, these strains harbored a wide range of antimicrobial mechanisms to second-line antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, clindamycin, and fusidic acid.",

Hetero-resistance (HR) is an unstable phenomenon with a high incidence in several bacterial strains, according to recent reports. It is considered unstable because subpopulations defined as hetero-resistant in one susceptibility test may no longer appear as such if the test is repeated. The recent finding of plasmid-associated HR mechanisms emphasizes the problem, since these HR mechanisms may spread horizontally between pathogens. The lack of routine determination by many laboratories and the decrease in antimicrobial activity may have clinical implications. Another important feature is that the decrease in antimicrobial activity caused by this phenomenon is not reflected in the MIC value. Previous research also suggests that HR can indeed be responsible for treatment failure in S. aureus infections. However, this phenomenon is not detected by established procedures and new methods are needed for rapid identification of HR in pathogenic bacteria [13].",

Several reports have indicated that topoisomerase IV is the primary target for quinolone resistance in Gram-positive microorganisms, including S. aureus with DNA-gyrase acting as secondary target, with specific point mutations at GrlA (subunit A of the topoisomerase IV) and GyrA (subunit A of the DNA-gyrase) as the most relevant [16]. However, our results differ because the mutation S144P in grlA gene may be a polymorphism, given that it is found in both susceptible and resistant strains. This means that the primary target in our strains is the DNA-gyrase. Studies in Japan have not shown mutations in the gyrB and grlB genes [17], which in any case tend to be infrequent in MRSA strains. Nevertheless, some of our strains showed more than three mutation points in each gene. Therefore, further studies are needed to confirm whether these mutations determine resistance or genetic polymorphisms. In addition, in gyrA and grlA, some rare mutations were described (Table 2). Because antibiotic combinations are used during nosocomial pneumonia treatment, these strains are exposed to strong antibiotic selection pressure which may contribute to the high number of mutations found here compared with prior studies. For instance, it has been demonstrated that hospital-acquired MRSA harbors higher levels of antimicrobial resistance than community-acquired MRSA [18].",

We suggest a chromosomal location of the fusB gene because the primers we used were developed in previous studies by O\u2019Neil et al. in which the fusB gene was detected in total DNA preparations but not in plasmid DNA preparations, indicating a chromosomal location for this resistance determinant (different fusB genes have been discovered on plasmid pUB101 and plasmid pUB102). Some previous data suggest that chromosomal fusB was associated with epidemic strains of S. aureus [25]. Interestingly, in another study fusB-type resistance (fusB and fusC) was found in 87% of MRSA isolates [24], with an association between fusB and clonal complexes CC45 and CC97. By contrast, we found only one strain with fusB, and this was the singleton ST1535. Fusidic acid is a topical drug that is used for the treatment of staphylococcal skin infections, but its increased use appears to have led to the emergence and dissemination of resistant staphylococci [26].",

Although we did not assess nasal MRSA carriage in our study, it has been shown to be an independent risk factor for ICU pneumonia in previous work [33].",

Second, although we did not assess the virulence of our MRSA strains, some of the clonal complexes identified, such as the CC59 and CC45, have been shown to be closely related to virulent strains. Immune evasion cluster (IEC) genes have been associated with CC59 (IEC-hemolysin genes) and CC45 (IEC-enterotoxin-hemolysin genes) [32].",

We also observed the presence of linezolid hetero-resistance and high resistance to second-line antibiotics in MRSA strains isolated from endotracheal tubes in humans mechanically ventilated for long periods in the ICU. These findings show that MRSA infection is still relevant in southern Europe, with a high capacity of resistance to different antimicrobials, an extensive battery of resistance mechanisms, and a wide clonal variability.",
