In eukaryotic cells, the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) that serves as the major intracellular pathway for protein degradation and modification plays a crucial role in the regulation of many fundamental cellular functions. A growing amount of evidence has suggested that the UPS can be utilized by positive-sense RNA viruses. The UPS eliminates excess viral proteins that prevent viral replication and modulates the function of viral proteins through post-translational modification mediated by ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins. This review will discuss the current understanding of how positive RNA viruses have evolved various mechanisms to usurp the host UPS to modulate the function and stability of viral proteins. In addition to the pro-viral function, UPS-mediated viral protein degradation may also constitute a host defense process against some positive-stranded RNA viral infections. This issue will also be discussed in the current review.",

Examples of this class of viruses include poliovirus, coxsackievirus, EMCV, HCV, HAV, SARS-CoV, West Nile virus, and dengue fever virus [1] . Positive-strand RNA viruses, either enveloped or non-enveloped, consist of a single positive-strand of RNA acting as mRNA to direct the synthesis of viral proteins.

Among the many host pathways that can be modulated by positive strand RNA viruses, the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), the major intracellular protein degradation pathway, has recently received considerable attention because the interaction between viruses and the UPS has been found to play important roles in many aspects of the viral life cycle [2, 3] . For positive-strand RNA viruses, it has been shown that an appropriate stoichiometric ratio of viral structural to non-structural proteins is essential for effective viral replication [4] [5] [6] . There is evidence that too much of certain viral non-structural proteins are disadvantageous for certain viruses to successfully replicate [6] . To ensure a proper ratio of viral proteins, some positive-strand RNA viruses employ the host regulatory mechanisms, for example, the UPS, to degrade excess viral proteins to prevent interference of these proteins with the viral replication. In addition, post-translational modification of some viral proteins mediated by ubiquitin and ubiquitinlike proteins of the UPS has also been demonstrated as an important means to regulate viral protein function without altering protein stability [2] .",

Protein degradation via the UPS starts with the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to a target protein (a process referred to as ubiquitylation) ( Figure 1 ). This process consists of multi-step ATP-dependent enzyme reactions. First, the ubiquitin is activated by ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 to form an E1-ubiquitin thioester intermediate. Figure 1 . Schematic illustration of post-translational modification of viral proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Post-translational modification mediated by mono-ubiquitylation or sumoylation is necessary for the regulation of viral protein functions. Proteasomal degradation mediated through either ubiquitin-dependent or ubiquitin-independent mechanisms controls the expression levels of viral proteins. The harmony of these modifications is required to maintain the appropriate level and function of viral proteins, which are crucial for successful infection",

The lysine residue of the conjugated ubiquitin is attached by another ubiquitin, consecutively, resulting in the formation of a poly-ubiquitin chain. The ubiquitin-tagged substrate protein is then delivered to the 20S proteasome, and the polypeptide is hydrolyzed into short oligopeptides and the free ubiquitin is recycled through the action of de-ubiquitinating enzymes [12, 13] . De-ubiquitinating enzyme plays important roles in UPS as it proofreads ubiquitinprotein conjugates, processes inactive ubiquitin precursors, and keeps sustainable proteolysis by maintaining sufficient ubiquitin within the cell [14] .

The best-characterized family of UBL proteins is the small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO), including SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3 [18, 19] . Protein modification by sumoylation is directed by an enzymatic cascade parallel to that involved in ubiquitylation ( Figure 1 ). SUMO is activated in an ATP-dependent manner by an E1-activating enzyme consisting of a heterodimer of the Aos1 and Uba2 proteins. After activation, SUMO is transferred to the SUMO E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9. Three classes of SUMO E3-ligases have been reported, RanBP2, PIAS and the Polycomb protein Pc2. The sumoylation target is a lysine that occurs in the consensus motif \u03a8KXE where \u03a8 is a hydrophobic amino acid and X is any residue. Like mono-ubiquitylation, sumoylation does not target proteins for degradation, but instead, regulates protein function and sub-cellular localization [20, 21] . A growing body of evidence suggests that sumoylation is particularly important in the regulation of transcription [22] . The role of sumoylation in controlling the function of viral proteins by posttranslational modification has also been increasingly recognized [18, 23] .",

Protein modification by ISG15, termed ISGylation, occurs in a mode similar to ubiquitylation and sumoylation that requires the sequential action of E1 (UBE1L), E2 (UbcH8), and E3 enzymes [24] . The process of ISG15 conjugation can be reversed by de-ISGylating enzymes [24] . Function of ISGylation has not been fully understood, but it is thought to alter the biological activities of the target proteins or compete for ubiquitylation and play significant roles in many cellular functions [ , there were reports that the host ISG15 conjugations system can also be exploited by HCV to facilitate viral production [29-31]. The exact mechanism for the pro-viral function of ISGylation remains unclear; however, it is speculated that ISGylation of HCV proteins or host proteins critical for HCV life-cycle promotes HCV production by altering the function or preventing target proteins from ubiquitinmediated degradation [31].",

Appropriate balance of viral RdRp concentration in infected cells was found to be a key factor affecting the membrane rearrangements, RNA replication, and RNA recombination efficiencies [33] [34] [35] . Transgenic overexpression of the 3D RdRp of the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus has been shown to have antiviral effects against the infection of this virus itself and other viruses [6, 36] . Although the detailed mechanisms remain to be elucidated, changes of the stoichiometry have been proposed to be one mechanism responsible for such antiviral properties of overexpressed 3D [37] . These studies imply that maintaining an appropriate level of RdRp is important for viral growth [6] . Indeed, the expression levels of RdRp of Sindbis virus, TYMV, HCV, and HAV have been reported to be regulated via UPS-regulated protein proteolysis [5, 19, [38] [39] [40] . It was shown that the RNA polymerase (NSP4) of Sindbis virus is degraded by the proteasome through the ubiquitin-dependent N-end rule pathway [38] . The N-end rule is a highly conserved degradation mechanism relating the stability of a protein with the nature of its N-terminal residue [41]. TYMV RdRp was also shown to be degraded by the proteasome at a late stage of viral infection [5] . This UPS-mediated TYMV RdRp degradation requires prerequisite phosphorylation at two residues (threonine-64 and serine-80) localized within the putative N-terminal PEST sequence (P, proline; E, glutamic acid; S, serine; T, threonine), a known protein degradation motif [19, 42] .",

Although the specific E3 ligase responsible for 3D ubiquitylation and the exact ubiquitylation site remain undetermined, this modification appears to be required for its function in regulating transcription of viral genome [44] . Besides ubiquitylation, it has also been found that the 3D polymerase of coxsackievirus can be sumoylated with SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3 (unpublished data). DNA alignment reveals one highly conserved sequence Valine-Lysine-Aspartic acid-Glutamic acid (VKDE), which could be found in the 3D of several different species of enteroviral 3D polymerases, that matches the \u03a8KXE consensus motif for sumoylation, suggesting that sumoylation may also be required for the regulation of 3D transcriptional activity.",

The levels of mature 3C protease of EMCV and HAV, both belonging to the picornavirus family, have been found to decrease rapidly after they reach maximum proteolytic activity, about halfway through the infectious cycle [47] [48] [49] [50] . It was later demonstrated that low concentrations of 3C in infected cells are largely attributed to increased protein turnover through ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation [48,51-53]. In the presence of proteasome inhibitors, poly-ubiquitinated 3C protein accumulated and the rate of 3C degradation was significantly reduced [48, 52] . Evidence also suggests that EMCV and HAV exploit the same ubiquitin enzymes for 3C ubiquitylation as 3C proteases of these two viruses were shown to compete with each other for ubiquitin conjugation [48] . Further investigation identified the amino acid sequences 34 LLVRGRTLVV 43 and 32 LGVKDDWLLV 41 that serve as the protein destruction signals for recognition and ubiquitylation of EMCV and HAV 3C proteases, respectively, by the host ubiquitinconjugating system [40,51-53]. Mutations within these sequences lead to increased stability of 3C proteases. The E3 ubiquitin ligase, E3a, has been shown to recognize these destruction signals of EMCV and HAV 3C proteases and catalyze the conjugation of ubiquitin to them [40,51,53]. The 3C protein of another virus in the picornavirus family, enterovirus 71 (EV71) has also been reported to be regulated by ubiquitin-mediated degradation [54] . It was found that sumoylation of EV71 3C at lysine 52 promotes its ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation [54] .",

Apoptosis at late stages of viral replication can promote viral progeny release. But premature cell death will perturb viral replication before the virus has completed its life cycle. It is therefore speculated that keeping a small amount of 3C protease is necessary, at least at the early stage of viral infection, to prevent premature cell death and allow efficient viral replication. However, the potential significance of UPS targeting viral protease for degradation in host antiviral defense cannot be completely ruled out.",

The degradation of NS2 was shown to be regulated in a phosphorylation-dependent manner mediated by casein kinase 2 on serine 164 residue [57] . Notably, ubiquitylation appears not to be required for NS2 degradation as NS2 lysine-toarginine mutagenesis does not affect its stability and expression levels [57, 59] .

The 3C proteases of rhinovirus and poliovirus, similar to those of EMCV and HAV, are present in low concentrations in infected cell [35,60,61]. However, it was found that poliovirus 3C is not conjugated with ubiquitin and remains stable during the viral life cycle [48] . Further studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanisms involved in maintaining low levels of polioviral 3C protease. Possible mechanisms may include blockage of ribosomal read-through and differential processing of polyproteins, leading to reduced production of 3C protease. A recent report has suggested that pseudoknot structures of the SARS-CoV RNA can stop the translation from upstream to downstream encoded viral proteins [62] . Some viral proteases have been shown to possess de-ubiquitinating enzyme activity. It was reported that the papain-like cysteine proteases of coronavirus [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] , hepatitis E virus [69] , and foot-and-mouth disease virus [70] have structural similarity to the cellular de-ubiquitinating enzymes and are able to efficiently hydrolyze ubiquitinated substrates. Although the viral and cellular targets remain largely unknown, the de-ubiquitinating activity of these proteases appears to play a significant role in viral life cycle and in blockage of host innate immunity.",

Ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation mediated by PA28g has also been shown to facilitate the degradation of HCV core protein [76, 79] . PA28g interacts directly with the core protein of HCV in the nucleus and regulates its degradation [76] . In animal experiments, this interaction has been demonstrated to play an important role in HCV pathogenesis as PA28g knockout disrupts the progression of steatosis, hepatocarcinoma, and insulin resistance induced by HCV core protein [74, 75] .

HCV F protein was found to be very labile with a short half-life (~10 min) and degraded by the proteasome [81, 85] . Further experimentation revealed that the degradation of F protein is ubiquitinindependent as a lysine-less F protein mutant remains unstable and its protein levels do not appears to be affected in a cell line with a temperature-sensitive E1 [82] . It was demonstrated that HCV F protein binds to the a3 subunit of the 20S proteasome and is degraded directly by the 20S proteasome in vitro [82] . The functional significance of F protein degradation in viral replication (pro-viral strategy versus host defense mechanism) warrants future investigation.",

The nucleocapsid (N) protein, a structural protein of SARS-CoV, was demonstrated to undergo post-translational modification by sumoylation [92, 93] . Using a yeast two-hybrid system, Ubc9, the E2-conjugating enzyme for sumoylation, was identified as the cellular protein interacting with the SARS-CoV N protein [92] . It was further demonstrated that N protein is covalently modified mainly at lysine 62 residue by SUMO [94] . Further investigation using wild-type N protein and a sumoylation mutant revealed that sumoylation of this protein increases its homo-oligomerization that may play a role in controlling viral replication cycle [94] . Swine fever virus core protein was also found to interact with the intracellular sumoylation pathway [95] . It binds to Ubc9 and SUMO-1 and disruption of these interactions results in attenuated viral virulence, suggesting a regulatory role of SUMO modification in viral infectivity [95] . Dengue virus is a member of the virus family Flaviviridae. Its envelope protein that is responsible for the virus attachment and entry to host cells has been shown to interact directly with SUMO E2 enzyme Ubc9. Further investigation demonstrates that overexpression of Ubc9 reduces the production of infectious virus, suggesting a role for SUMO modification in attenuating viral infectivity [96] .",
