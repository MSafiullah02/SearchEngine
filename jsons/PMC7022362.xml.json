            "text": "MERS-CoV belongs to the family Coronaviridae, which are enveloped viruses with single-stranded positive-sense RNA genomes (6). Coronaviruses (CoVs) can be classified into four genera: alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-CoVs (7). Beta-CoVs are further divided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D) (6). Both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are beta-CoVs but belong to different lineages. MERS-CoV is a lineage C virus, while SARS-CoV is a member of lineage B (8). SARS-CoV is hypothesized to have originated in bats and then to have infected humans either indirectly through an intermediate host (e.g., palm civets or raccoon dogs) (9) or without an intermediate host (10). Accumulating data suggest that dromedary camels are the primary reservoir host for MERS-CoV, and multiple independent transmissions seem to have occurred from dromedary camels to humans (11, 12). Recent studies also indicate the susceptibility of alpacas for natural MERS-CoV infection and suggest that alpacas may be another MERS-CoV animal reservoir (13, 14). In addition, gene fragments that are identical to MERS-CoV have also been identified in bats from both Saudi Arabia and Africa (15, 16).",

Cell lines from certain species of bats also support the replication of MERS-CoV (18). More importantly, Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis) support the replication of MERS-CoV, with detectable shedding of the virus in the respiratory and intestinal tracts for up to 9 days (19). In contrast to domestic animals such as dromedary camels and alpacas, certain species of bats migrate (20). The characteristics of migration among bats emphasize their roles in transmitting infectious diseases, including CoV-related diseases. Therefore, studying the potential transmission of MERS-CoV among varied species of bats, which are widely distributed around the world, has significant implications for the surveillance and control of MERS-CoV infection.",

Spike (S) protein, integrated into the CoV envelope, can be cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits (21). The S1 subunit is responsible for receptor engagement. The S2 subunit possesses a typical structure of a type I fusion protein and mediates membrane fusion between the viral envelope and host cell membranes (4, 22, 23). For MERS-CoV, the C-terminal domain in S1, which is called the MERS receptor binding domain (MERS-RBD), interacts with the human CD26 (hCD26) receptor (also called DPP IV) (24). The ability of bCD26s from varied species to interact with MERS-RBD would be an indicator of the susceptibility of bats to MERS-CoV infection and, to some extent, suggests the potential of bats for transmitting MERS-CoV.",

In contrast, the BIAcore binding profiles between MERS-RBD and all of the tested bCD26s displayed fast on and off rates.

Indeed, HKU4 can use the same receptor as MERS-CoV, hCD26, to enter cells (26), indicating the origin of MERS-CoV from bat CoVs. Although no live MERS-CoVs have been isolated from bats to date, gene segments identical to this virus have been sequenced from bats distributed in both Saudi Arabia (Taphozous perforatus) and South Africa (Neoromicia zuluensis) (15, 16). In addition, Jamaican fruit bats support experimental MERS-CoV infection (19). The data in the present study, together with previously published data, demonstrate that bCD26s from a diverse range of species support the entry of both pseudotyped and wild-typed MERS-CoV into cells (17). Therefore, bats may still be infected and transmit the virus even if they are not a direct natural host of MERS-CoV, such as dromedary camels.",

Interestingly, among the purified bCD26s, M. davidii bCD26 displayed the least homology to hCD26 in the blade IV and V regions, which are the regions for binding to MERS-RBD. However, M. davidii bCD26 displayed the highest binding affinity to MERS-RBD among the tested bat CD26s. Further structural analysis indicated a similar binding mode of MERS-RBD with hCD26 and M. davidii bCD26, emphasizing the possible origin of MERS-CoV from bats. Similar to hCD26, the glycosylation of the residue equivalent to N229 in hCD26 and the hydrophobic core conferred by the \u03b13 helix establish the interaction with MERS-RBD. In terms of the 13 key residues in the human receptor responsible for the ligand interaction, there are three substitutions in M. davidii bCD26, namely, V283 versus T288, T290 versus I295, and K331 versus R336. Notably, only the substitution of T290 with its counterpart I295 in hCD26 increased the binding affinity to the ligand. The side chain of T290 in bCD26 is avoided by the hydrophobic interface and led to a shift in H-bond pairs. In contrast, neither V283T nor K331R increased the bat receptor binding to MERS-RBD. Further scrutiny of the binding interface uncovered that the rigid P330 N-terminal to K331 in bat receptor, instead of the flexible G335 in the human receptor, limits the orientation of the extended lysine residue and decreases the interaction. The P330G and K331R substitutions would essentially increase the interaction of M. davidii bCD26 with the viral ligand. This structurally detailed information indicates the varied adaptation of the viral ligand to the bat and human receptors.",

P. vampyrus bCD26 mutants containing either N331A or S333R exhibited smaller bands than the wild type when tested by Western blotting. In addition, both P. vampyrus bCD26 mutants significantly enhanced the interaction with MERS-RBD, implying that P. vampyrus bCD26 contains N331-linked glycans, which likely hinder the interaction with MERS-RBD. Similarly, both P. alecto bCD26 mutants (N330A or S332R) displayed significantly higher interaction with the viral ligand than the wild type, as determined by FACS. However, the difference in migration between P. alecto bCD26 and the two mutants was not obvious, which is probably due to the short glycans modified at this site, if there are any. Carbohydrates at residue N327/N326 of M. lucifugus and M. brandtii bCD26s likely decreased the association with MERS-RBD, too.
