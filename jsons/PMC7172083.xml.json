Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV)\u2014also known by the name of the European strain, Lelystad virus\u2014is a ubiquitous and highly infectious virus of pigs, causing respiratory disease, weight loss, and spontaneous abortion in infected animals and leading to great economic loss in the U.S. and Europe (Wenswoort, 1993). Measures to regulate the disease have been complicated by the high heterogeneity of the virus (Meng, 2000) and its pattern of persistent, subclinical infection with occasional epidemic outbreaks Blaha 2000, Zimmermann et al. 1997. Vaccines have been developed, but have not proven to be highly effective Meng 2000, Mengeling et al. 2003. PRRSV infects exclusively alveolar macrophages, leading to apoptosis in secondary cells and immune system suppression Molitor et al. 1997, Murtaugh et al. 2002 and is often found in combination with other pathogens, such as Streptococcus suis and Haemophilus parasuis\n(Zimmermann et al., 1997).",

            "text": "PRRSV is a member of the Arteriviridae, a recently recognized viral family genomically related to the coronaviruses Meulenberg et al. 1993, Plagemann and Moennig 1992, Snijder and Meulenberg 1998. Other arteriviruses include lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) of mice, equine arteritis virus (EAV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). Like the coronaviruses, arteriviruses have a positive-sense single-stranded (+) RNA genome, which is expressed through a set of subgenomic mRNA transcripts, each used for the translation of one open reading frame (ORF). In the 15 kb PRRSV genome, the first and largest ORF codes for the nonstructural proteins, including two proteases and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. ORFs 2\u20135 encode glycosylated membrane proteins (GP2 to GP5), ORF6 encodes a nonglycosylated membrane protein (M), and ORF7 encodes the nucleocapsid (N) protein Dea et al. 2000, Meulenberg et al. 1995b. The N protein is the most abundant protein expressed in infected cells, comprising 40% of the proteins in the virion, and is the most immunogenic protein of the virus (Meulenberg et al., 1995a). The N protein forms a spherical, possibly icosahedral nucleocapsid core of 20\u201330 nm diameter, which is surrounded by a lipid envelope containing the viral membrane proteins, yielding a relatively smooth spherical virion of about 60 nm diameter (Dea et al., 2000). The N-terminal half of the 123 residue N protein contains a large number of Lys, Gln, and Asn residues (Figure 1)\nand is presumed to be involved in RNA binding by analogy with similar regions in other enveloped RNA viruses. The C-terminal half constitutes the shell-forming domain of the protein, and the 11 C-terminal residues have been reported previously to be important for capsid formation (Wootton et al., 2001).",

Finally, using single-wavelength anomalous diffraction from the two sulfur atoms in the sequence (S-SAD) has allowed us to solve the structure from the native protein. S-SAD for ab initio phasing of native data has recently been shown to be a useful technique Dauter 2002, Micossi et al. 2002, and the fact that we could solve the structure by S-SAD phasing using only relatively low-resolution data demonstrates the general applicability of this method even for data of modest quality.",

Starting phases were calculated with the program SOLVE (Terwilliger, 2002) using data to 2.8 \u00c5 resolution. Four S sites were identified, consistent with the presence of two Cys residues per N monomer (Figure 2A)\n. Density modification and autotracing was carried out with RESOLVE (Terwilliger, 2003) and resulted in a partial backbone trace of 78 (out of 144) residues (Figure 2A). Although about a third of the initial trace turned out to be incorrect, a 2-fold noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) axis could be identified by manual inspection of the map, using this trace and the positions of the Cys residues known from the S sites. This information was used for NCS averaging and solvent flattening with the program DM (Cowtan and Main, 1998). The resulting map was sufficiently good to allow most of the sequence to be built, except for the polyhistidine tag and two amino acids at the N terminus and four residues at the C terminus (Figures 2B and 2C). Refinement with REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al., 1997) yielded a final Rcryst= 0.21 and Rfree= 0.26 (Table 1).",

The N\u039457 monomer contains two antiparallel \u03b2 strands flanked on both sides by \u03b1 helices Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3. The N\u039457 dimer is organized such that the four \u03b2 strands together form a continuous, flat antiparallel \u03b2 sheet floor, superposed by the two long \u03b12 helices and flanked on both sides by the N- and C-terminal helices \u03b11 and \u03b13 (Figure 3A). A DALI search of the protein data bank (Holm and Sander, 1995) did not identity any other significantly similar folds. The top hit (chorismate mutase, PDB code 1ECM) gave a Z score of 3.0 and had a dimeric structure, but the similarity did not extend beyond the two long \u03b12 helices. However, we were struck by the similarity of the overall organization of the N protein to that of the coat protein of the RNA bacteriophage MS2 (Valeg\u00e5rd et al., 1990) and the peptide recognition domain of the human histocompatibility antigen (HLA) (Saper et al., 1991). Both these proteins have a dimeric arrangement of two long \u03b1 helices superposing a flat \u03b2 sheet (Figure 3B). However, the similarity is only superficial, as the topology of these proteins is different from N, and MS2 and HLA have more extensive, four-stranded \u03b2 sheets.",

            "text": "Considering the tight and symmetric nature of the N dimers, they almost certainly also represent the building block for the shell. Furthermore, antigenic analysis suggested an adjacent location for residues 51\u201367 and 80\u201390, and dimer formation puts these residues close together (Meulenberg et al., 1998). It was previously reported that N is incorporated into virions as disulphide-linked dimers Mardassi et al. 1996, Wootton and Yoo 2003. Indeed, the two Cys residues Cys75 and Cys90 from separate chains were positioned opposite one another in the structure (Figure 2D). However, the distance (5.3 \u00c5) was too great for a disulphide bond to form. Furthermore, the Lelystad strain of PRRSV lacks Cys90, and the N\u039457 crystals were grown under reducing conditions, so disulphide formation is clearly not a requirement for dimerization. Disulphide formation during nucleocapsid assembly may instead involve the conserved Cys24 in the RNA binding domain and may primarily play a role in stabilizing the nucleocapsid structure (Wootton and Yoo, 2003). The N-terminal half of the protein can dimerize independently of the capsid-forming domain and in the absence of disulphide bonding (Wootton and Yoo, 2003). Such dimerization could lead to crosslinking of the N dimers, providing a possible mechanism for particle assembly (Figure 3E). Wootton et al. (2002) reported phosphorylation on Ser residues in both the RNA binding domain and the capsid-forming domain. The proposed phosphorylated Ser residues are located near the surface of the protein, on \u03b12 (Ser 70, Ser 77, and Ser 78), in the \u03b2 turn (Ser 93 and Ser 95), and in \u03b22 (Ser 99). However, no phosphorylation occurred upon expression in bacteria, and no electron density corresponding to phosphate groups was observed in these positions in the N\u039457 map. Therefore, phosphorylation in these residues is unlikely to play a role in dimerization.",

Full-length N protein expressed in E. coli can be assembled in vitro into ribbons similar to those found in the crystals, as well as shells of various sizes (Figure 3D), suggesting that the crystal arrangement may be relevant to the organization of N protein in the nucleocapsid shells.

The floor is rather hydrophobic in character, consistent with an internal location (Figure 4B). This arrangement would place the N termini on the interior side of the shell, allowing the preceding RNA binding domains to interact with the genome (Figure 3E). This arrangement is similar to that of MS2 (Figure 3B), where the dimers are organized through 3-fold interactions on a T=3 lattice (Valeg\u00e5rd et al., 1990). We imagine a similar arrangement in PRRSV, perhaps effected through dimerization in the RNA binding domains and most likely involving interactions with the RNA genome (Wootton and Yoo, 2003)\n(Figure 3E). Such an arrangement could easily be extended to larger shells. Even if the shell lacks global icosahedral symmetry, such interactions could form the basis for a nucleocapsid organized by local symmetry alone. Indeed, viral capsid proteins often show considerable flexibility to form a wide range of interactions while retaining the same tertiary structure (Dokland, 2000). In this arrangement, \u03b12 would be on the surface of the nucleocapsid and would most likely interact with the cytoplasmic part of the envelope membrane proteins (Figure 3E), perhaps in a fashion similar to the interaction of HLA with its target peptide (Garboczi et al., 1996).",

The most common type of viral capsid domain of nonenveloped (+) RNA viruses is the eight-stranded \u03b2 barrel motif also common in DNA viruses (Strauss and Strauss, 2002). Interestingly, the structural context of the fold is quite different in all these viruses, with little conservation of the subunit interfaces, suggesting that the viruses have evolved by divergent evolution from a common ancestor rather than based on any particular advantages of this fold in particular. The main known exception to this motif is the RNA bacteriophage MS2 and its relatives, which have a fold more similar to that of the HLA proteins Saper et al. 1991, Valeg\u00e5rd et al. 1990.",

            "text": "Nucleocapsid proteins of enveloped (+) RNA viruses, however, appear to belong to a different lineage. Superficially, the virions of toga-, flavi- and arterivirus virions have a similar architecture. However, based on differences in genomic organization as well as homologies in nonstructural proteins, these three groups are considered representatives of three evolutionarily separate superfamilies (Strauss and Strauss, 2002). The nucleocapsid protein of Sindbis virus, a togavirus, has a chymotrypsin-like fold (Choi et al., 1991). Like the PRRSV N protein, the Sindbis virus nucleocapsid protein has a positively charged and flexible amino-terminal half. However, the PRRSV protein is only half the size of that of Sindbis virus and has a different fold, supporting the notion that the arteriviruses are evolutionarily separate from the togaviruses. Interestingly, coronaviruses, which are clearly related to arteriviruses based on their similar genomic organization, are structurally quite different and have a much larger capsid protein that forms a helical nucleocapsid and most likely has a different fold (Strauss and Strauss, 2002). Although the nucleocapsid proteins of flaviviruses are comparable in size to that of PRRSV, their structures are also most likely different, as the charge distribution in the sequence differs completely. These differences may not tell the whole story, however, since structural similarities between the glycoproteins of Semliki Forest virus, a togavirus (Lescar et al., 2001), and tick-borne encephalitis virus, a flavivirus (Rey et al., 1995), have suggested a closer evolutionary relationship between these two groups of viruses. Thus, structurally, the enveloped RNA viruses are a much more diverse group than the nonenveloped viruses, displaying a mixed evolutionary heritage. Evolution of these viruses may be based on a \u201cmix and match\u201d principle, whereby different structural motifs are borrowed and used in different contexts. Our results shed some light on these structural relationships. Knowledge of the structures of other arterivirus proteins, such as the envelope glycoproteins, will be helpful in further unraveling the evolutionary relationships between the arteriviruses and other viral families.",

A total of 720 frames were collected with an oscillation angle of 0.5\u00b0 to provide a highly redundant data set for SAD phasing (Table 1). The data were processed using the HKL package (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). Local scaling, location of sulfur sites, and initial SAD phasing was done with the program SOLVE using data out to 2.8 \u00c5 resolution (Terwilliger, 2002). Four S sites with an occupancy of >0.5 were identified, giving a Z score of 10.8 and an average figure of merit of 0.26. Density modification and autotracing with RESOLVE (Terwilliger, 2003) resulted in an improved map with a mean figure of merit of 0.50 and a partial trace of the protein backbone (Figure 2A). Using this partial trace and the known positions of the S atoms, an approximate axis of 2-fold NCS could be identified by manual inspection of the map using the program O (Jones et al., 1991). This information was used for NCS averaging, histogram matching, and solvent flattening with the program DM (Cowtan and Main, 1998), yielding mean figure of merit of 0.79. This resulting map was sufficiently good to allow most of the sequence to be built manually, using O (Jones et al., 1991). Subsequent maximum-likelihood refinement, including 20 cycles of TLS refinement, was done with REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al., 1997), yielding a final Rcryst= 0.210 and Rfree= 0.267 (Table 1), after placement of 25 water molecules in the map.",
