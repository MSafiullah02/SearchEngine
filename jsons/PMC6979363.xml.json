Different serotypes of APEC cause local or systemic infectious diseases in poultry, including respiratory infections, sepsis, polyserositis, coligranuloma, cellulitis, yolk sac infection, omphalitis, and swollen head syndrome, resulting in significant economic losses to the poultry industry [3]. Strains of APEC and neonatal meningitis-associated E. coli (NMEC, a subpathotype of ExPEC), the latter of which causes infections in humans, reportedly share some common virulence genes [4\u20136]. It is thus particularly important to study the genes encoding virulence factors in APEC strains. These strains contain several virulence-associated genes that encode various virulence factors, including adhesins (fimC, ompA, papC), invasins (ibeA), avian haemolysins (hlyF), serum survival proteins (iss, ompT), and siderophores (iutA, fyuA, iroN); moreover, they show the presence of a pathogenicity island [7\u20139].",

This element plays a key role in basic cellular processes, such as cellular respiration, DNA replication, and electron transport and is accordingly essential for bacterial survival in host tissues [10\u201312]. Furthermore, iron is a necessary growth factor for bacteria and is reportedly involved in the expression of bacterial virulence factors [13]. Iron uptake factors evidently play a pivotal role in E. coli growth and pathogenesis. Bacteria employ different strategies to absorb iron from their environment, including siderophore-mediated iron uptake, which occurs on the cell surface [14]. In addition, bacteria either excessively reduce the external pH or dissolve iron oxide to meet their iron requirements by reducing ferric iron to a relatively soluble ferrous form. Another common strategy is to synthesize and secrete iron chelators, such as siderophores, as intracellular iron (Fe2+) is rarely found in natural conditions, and Fe2+ can be readily oxidized to Fe3+ in the presence of oxygen and water [15]. Siderophores then combine with the available iron (Fe3+) to form an iron\u2013siderophore complex, which binds to specific receptor proteins on the bacterial cell surface, consequently entering cells via the TonB-dependent transport system, followed by iron release. Siderophore-mediated ferric uptake requires specific outer membrane (OM) receptors, such as FhuA, FecA, and FepA, which reportedly exist in E. coli [16]. These OM receptors share the same structural properties and acquire energy by coupling with TonB proteins located in the inner membrane, and they are referred to as TonB-dependent receptors (TBDRs) [17].",

A single mutant strain for each of the three genes (0007, 0008, 2235) was constructed using the Red homologous recombination method in E. coli [26]. Briefly, for generation of the 0007 mutant strain, a gene-targeting fragment containing a homologous arm on both sides of 0007 was amplified by PCR using the plasmid pKD4 as the template, which contains the phage \u03bb Red system under the control of an arabinose promoter. Competent DE205B cells containing pKD46 were then prepared; l-arabinose was added to induce the expression of the phage \u03bb Red system, and the target fragments were transformed by electroporation into DE205B to replace 0007 with the resistance gene. The recombinant strain was screened by growth on LB plates supplemented with kanamycin and identified by cross-PCR. Details of the primers (0007-F/0007-R, K1, K2) used for amplification are listed in Additional file 1. Next, the temperature-sensitive plasmid pCP20 was transformed into the recombinant strain to remove the resistance gene. Finally, pCP20 was removed by growth at 42 \u00b0C for 24 h to obtain the mutant strain DE205B\u03940007 that did not show any resistance. For analysis of the effect of tonB deletion on the TBDRs, a tonB mutant strain was also constructed using the same method. Similarly, the 0008, 2235, and tonB mutant strains, namely, DE205B\u03940008, DE205B\u03942235, and DE205B\u0394tonB, respectively, were obtained.",

Herein, IreA and TonB were expressed in vitro, and their interaction was determined via GST pulldown assays, which confirmed that ireA is a TBDR. In addition to ireA, three genes (0007, 0008, and 2235) were confirmed to encode TBDRs; however, compared to the expression levels of 0007, 0008, and 2235, that of ireA was the most upregulated in response to iron depletion. Moreover, in the ireA mutant strain DE205B\u0394ireA, iron uptake was increased, consistent with the excessive compensatory expression of other iron uptake-related genes. These findings are similar to those reported for the known TBDR fepA, indicating that ireA might function similarly to fepA [17].",

In this study, a tonB mutant strain was constructed to analyse the effect of tonB deletion on TBDRs. The obtained results indicated that iron uptake by this mutant strain was significantly decreased; the medium used for culturing DE205B\u0394tonB turned red as the free iron in the culture medium was oxidized. In addition, the expression level of ireA in DE205B\u0394tonB was significantly upregulated and that of fur was downregulated. Due to severe iron uptake defects, an iron-depleted environment was created, causing fur to upregulate the expression of the TBDRs in DE205B\u0394tonB, which implies that the TBDRs are regulated by fur and not directly affected by the presence or absence of tonB.",

In this study, ireA was indeed shown to be a TBDR. Our previous research has proven that ireA also plays a role in adhesion and stress resistance in APEC [13, 21]. Adhesion is the first step in APEC colonization, and the development of a receptor antagonist could protect against the establishment of a bacterial infection. As a multifunctional receptor, IreA may have potential for vaccine development. Each TBDR is composed of a 22-strand \u03b2-barrel and an N-terminal TonB box domain with which TonB interacts [38\u201340]. TonB interacts in vivo with the TonB box of TBDRs (FepA, FhuA, FecA) to form disulphide bonds and eventually transport iron into cells. TBDRs specifically recognize iron carriers. However, the TonB box domain of IreA has not yet been identified, and the iron siderophore structure to which it binds has not been studied either. Future research should focus on investigating these issues.",
