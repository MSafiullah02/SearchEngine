            "text": "It has been shown that SARS\u2010CoV replication is enhanced in the presence of proteases such as trypsin or elastase (17). The possible molecular mechanism of this enhancement is the potentiation of SARS\u2010CoV infection from the cell surface, which is more efficient than the infection via an endosomal pathway which takes place in the absence of proteases (17). Elastase, a major protease produced in lung inflammation, could enhance SARS\u2010CoV replication in the lungs, which would, in turn, result in severe damage to this organ. We first examined whether infection with Pp induced elastase in the lungs. Pp is of low virulence and, as a rule, causes only mild, never severe, respiratory disease in adult mice (21). Six\u2010week\u2010old BALB/c mice were infected i.n. with 2.0 \u00d7 107 c.f.u. of Pp, and elastase activity in both lung homogenates and BAL was monitored. At one day p.i., significant amounts of elastase were detected in the BAL and lungs of Pp\u2010infected mice, while elastase activity was undetectable in samples from uninfected mice (Fig. 1a). We also examined the effect of LPS administration on elastase production in the lungs, since LPS has been used as an elastase inducer (22). Mice administered i.n. with 20 \u03bcl of LPS (1 mg/ml) dissolved in PBS were shown to produce elastase in the lungs one to two days after administration, similar to infection with Pp (Fig. 1b). These results show that Pp and LPS are appropriate agents for inducing elastase in the lungs and BAL.",

We used two different SARS\u2010CoVs; one was Fr\u20101 isolated from diseased humans (1, 18) and the other a mouse\u2010adapted virus called Fr\u2010mo which was passaged 10 times through the mice and finally grown in VeroE6 cells as described in Materials and Methods. Fr\u2010mo has four amino acid changes in the spike, ORF1a and ORF1b compared with those of Fr\u20101 reported previously (18). Mice were infected with 1.3 \u00d7 107 c.f.u. of Pp and, one day later, were co\u2010infected with 1.1 \u00d7 106 and 0.8 \u00d7 106 p.f.u. of Fr\u20101 and Fr\u2010mo, respectively, by the i.n. route. As shown in Figures 2a and b, mice inoculated with Pp alone showed a transient loss of body weight and ruffled hair from one to four days pi. Mice infected with Fr\u20101 or Fr\u2010mo alone rarely showed weight loss and ruffled hair. When mice were infected with both Pp and Fr\u20101, the clinical symptoms were similar to those of mice inoculated with Pp alone, and included transient loss of body weight and ruffled hair (Fig. 2a). In contrast, mice co\u2010infected withPp + Fr\u2010mo had severe weight loss, and most of them did not recover during the observation period (eight days p.i.) (Fig. 2b). Those mice showed clinical symptoms, such as ruffled hair from one day after Pp infection and hunched posture from three to four days after Fr\u2010mo infection. These symptoms continued during the observation period. On days four to eight p.i., these mice lost 30% or greater of their body weight, and more than 33% of those mice died after exhibiting severe respiratory disease. Thus, mice co\u2010infected with Pp + Fr\u2010mo developed severe respiratory disease, suggesting the possibility that elastase produced by Pp infection exacerbated infection by SARS\u2010CoV adapted to mice. We also infected mice that had been administered LPS with Fr\u2010mo (Fig. 2c). These mice developed weight loss and clinical symptoms similar to those displayed by mice inoculated with Pp + Fr\u2010mo. One\u2010half of the infected mice died by day four p.i., but the remaining mice gradually recovered (Fig. 2c). This finding also supported the possibility that elastase is involved in the exacerbation of respiratory disease caused by SARS\u2010CoV infection.",

Those mice were infected under conditions identical to those shown in Figure 2. When examined on days two and four p.i., Fr\u2010mo had grown at a rate 10\u2010 to 50\u2010fold higher in the lungs of mice than had Fr\u20101, (Fig. 3a and b), showing that Fr\u2010mo has a higher potential to grow in mice. On day two p.i. virus titers in the lungs were about 100\u2010fold higher in mice infected with Pp and Fr\u20101 than in mice infected with Fr\u20101 alone. However, by the fourth day p.i., there was not a significant difference between the two groups (Fig. 3a). On day two p.i. the virus titers of mice infected with Pp + Fr\u2010mo were slightly, but significantly higher than those of mice infected with Fr\u2010mo alone. The difference in virus titers between mice infected with Pp + Fr\u2010mo and those with Fr\u2010mo alone was also evident at four days p.i. (Fig. 3b). These results show that infection with Pp greatly enhanced the infection of Fr\u20101, but had a less remarkable effect in the infection of Fr\u2010mo in the early phase of viral infection. More significant enhancement of Fr\u2010mo infection was observed when mice were infected with low titers of virus. When mice were infected with 1 \u00d7 104 or 1 \u00d7 102 p.f.u., the virus titers were about 10\u2010fold higher in mice co\u2010infected with Pp + Fr\u2010mo than in those infected with Fr\u2010mo alone on both two and four days p.i. (Fig. 3c). Enhancement of Fr\u2010mo infection in the lungs was also observed in mice that had received LPS as compared with mice without LPS administration (data not shown). These results collectively suggest that the elastase induced by Pp infection or LPS administration enhanced the infection produced by mouse\u2010adapted Fr\u2010mo in mouse lungs.",

As shown in Figure 4, the lung elastase activity of mice infected with Pp was significantly higher than that in mice not infected with Pp, when they were examined on day two, but not on day four, after SARS\u2010CoV infection. It was also clear that neither Fr\u20101 nor Fr\u2010mo elicited elastase by themselves. These data, together with the findings from virus titers in the lungs shown in Figures 3a and b, indicate the possibility that elastase produced in the lungs following Pp infection efficiently (about 100\u2010fold) enhanced Fr\u20101 infection, and not so efficiently (less than 10\u2010fold), but still significantly enhanced, Fr\u2010mo infection. However, the slightly higher titers found four days p.i. in the lungs of mice infected with Pp + Fr\u2010mo could not be explained by the direct influence of elastase on Fr\u2010mo infection in the lungs. An important condition for sustaining high titers beyond four days p.i. would be that of high replication in the lungs in an early phase of infection, which could be facilitated by elastase induced by Pp. These data suggest that severe respiratory disease caused by co\u2010infection of Pp and mouse\u2010adapted SARS\u2010CoV is attributable to the high replication of virus in the lungs, for which the elastase produced by Pp infection is probably responsible.",

They also show that the diseases caused by this viral infection were asymptomatic, and that only transient replication of virus took place in the lungs of the mice. Also, with a few exceptions, many other species of animals shown to be susceptible to SARS\u2010CoV infection did not develop an exacerbated respiratory disease (27, 28, 29). The present study showed that we could induce a severe respiratory disease in mice resembling that found in humans with SARS\u2010CoV infection. Mice co\u2010infected with low\u2010virulent respiratory bacterium Pp and SARS\u2010CoV developed severe pneumonia and more than 35% of infected mice died. The present study indicates that two conditions are critical for the establishment of severe disease, both of which were documented to be important for development of SARS. One is the enhancement of SARS\u2010CoV infection by proteases produced by the host cells (17). The other is the evolution of SARS\u2010CoV to an extent that it can become highly infectious and pathogenic to a given species of animals to which SARS\u2010CoV is adapted (15, 19, 30, 31). When these two conditions are fulfilled, severe respiratory disease can be reproduced.",

The mouse\u2010adapted virus has several genetic mutations accompanying the amino acid mutations not only in the S but also M, ORF1a and 1b genes. Recombinant viruses containing mutations in the S and M alone or those containing mutations in ORF1a and 1b alone were not highly virulent, but viruses with mutations in all of those genes showed a high virulence, indicating that the virulence of SARS\u2010CoV is determined by multiple genes. Similar observations were reported from Weiss's laboratory for MHV infection. They reported that S is a major determinant of the neurovirulence of MHV\u2010JHM strain, but that genes outside the S are also involved in virulence (31, 32). Mouse\u2010adapted Fr\u2010mo used in the present study has amino acid changes in the S as well as in ORF1a and 1b as compared with the non\u2010virulent Fr\u20101 strain.

As has been elucidated in cultured cells by Matsuyama et al. (17), elastase could enhance SARS\u2010CoV replication in the lung. Alternatively, elastase could be involved in the development of severe respiratory disease via its pathophysiological functions, such as proteolytic activity, enhancement of blood vessel permeability and induction of proinflammatory cytokine secretion (22). These activities of elastase produced in the lungs are reported to be responsible for acute lung injury (22). However, elastase alone is not responsible for the severe respiratory disease described in the present study, since mice infected with Pp alone did not develop severe respiratory disease, although it induced as much elastase production as did Pp + Fr\u2010mo infection. Thus, extensive infection of SARS\u2010CoV in the lungs could contribute to the development of severe respiratory disease. Studies using elastase inhibitors and anti\u2010elastase antibodies are now in progress to see whether elastase is involved in the pathogenesis of SARS.",

(34) described that ACE2, the SARS\u2010CoV receptor, plays an important role in preventing lung damage and edema by converting angiotensin II with lung damage activity to a less damaging angiotensin1\u20107. SARS\u2010CoV replication in the lung is known to down\u2010regulate ACE2, resulting in an increase in angiotensin II and lung injury (35). Another mechanism is the severe lung injury caused by cytokines and chemokines produced as a result of SARS\u2010CoV infection. Several different animal models show that high concentrations of inflammatory cytokines could be responsible for the pathogenesis of SARS (9, 13, 14, 15). In the present study our hypothesis that high replication of SARS\u2010CoV, presumably due to the presence of proteases that enhance SARS\u2010CoV infection, is responsible for the pathogenesis of SARS does not contradict the above two proposed mechanisms of SARS pathogenesis, since high replication results in greater down\u2010regulation of ACE2 in the lung and also induces higher cytokine production, as shown in the present study. We believe that the mechanism underlying higher replication of the virus in the lung could be of primary importance in the induction of SARS.",

It is possible that exacerbation of SARS in these people could be attributed to co\u2010infection by non\u2010 or low\u2010pathogenic agents, such as mycoplasma, chlamydia and the like, although these agents were not often isolated from the patients' lungs (1, 35). However, this does not imply that these agents did not intensify the effects of SARS, since there is a possibility that they may induce a mild inflammation that triggers SARS\u2010CoV's high replication, while failing to themselves grow in the lungs. This may be inferred from the finding in the present study that Pp infection exacerbated SARS\u2010CoV infection, but it did not multiply efficiently in the lungs of mice.",

Such animals are kept \u201cclean\u201d in the sense that they are purposely not exposed to many microorganisms in a laboratory setting.
