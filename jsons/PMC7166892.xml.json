Glucocorticoids were given, because it is currently the only treatment thought to have a beneficial effect on cats with FIP although there are no controlled studies.3, 37 Antibiotics were administered to minimize the risk of bacterial infection because paracentesis was performed daily (if effusion was present), and because of the high dosage of glucocorticoid treatment.

Serum components can impact the accuracy of ELISA results and may interfere with antibody binding or show cross\u2010reactivity. To assess recovery of serum samples and to assess accuracy of measured values, 200 pg TNF\u2010\u03b1 were spiked into a serum sample of a healthy cat. The sample was diluted in sample diluent (PBS15 + 10% fetal calf serum16) 2\u2010fold to yield samples containing 100, 50, and 25 pg. As a control, sample diluent was spiked and diluted accordingly. The spiked undiluted control yielded results in the expected range (89%). The spiked undiluted serum sample showed recovery of 65%, indicating inhibitors of detection in the serum. The serum at a 1 : 2 dilution showed recovery of 73% compared to 88% of the diluted control. The recovery loss of 15% was considered acceptable, and interference of inhibiting components appeared to be not severe; all serum samples were therefore diluted 1 : 2 for detection of TNF\u2010\u03b1. The ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 96\u2010well microplate14 was coated with capture antibody by overnight incubation. The next day, the wells were washed and samples (diluted 1 : 2) and standards14 were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. After washing, the detection antibody14 was added and incubated for another 2 hours at room temperature. For detection, streptavidin\u2010HRP14 was used with tetramethylbenzidin14 as a substrate solution. The reaction was stopped after 10 minutes with 0.5 M sulfuric acid.14 The ELISA was measured with a Bio Tek Reader,17 and the data analysis was performed using Gen5 Data Analysis software.18\n",

If signs of vasculitis were apparent, the immune\u2010mediated process in cats with FIP might have been progressed too far to be delayed by PPF. In the present study, 21 of the 23 cats already showed effusion at the day of presentation. As shown in an experimental trial, signs of FIP become apparent 1\u20132 weeks after inoculation of the mutated feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV).40 As the effect of PTX is described by the manufacturer information1 to be seen after 2\u20134 weeks after treatment initiation, and it is an assumption that the same time frame would apply to PPF, most of the cats were already dead before an effect could be reached. A further reason for lack of PPF efficiency in this study could be that the treatment intervals could have been too long. An application of PPF every 12 hours was used in this trial following the anecdotal reports describing an effect of PTX in cats.4, 6, 32, 41 The manufacturer instruction recommends administration of PTX 3 times daily in human medicine,20 because of a relatively short plasma half\u2010life of 0.4\u20130.8 hours of the drug.

Glucocorticoids are routinely used in cats with FIP,1, 3, 44, 45, 46, 47 as it is not the virus itself that causes major damage but the cat's own immune reaction that leads to the fatal consequences. There are no evidence based studies that glucocorticoids have a positive effect in cats with FIP.37 The cats of the present study received an immunosuppressive dose of glucocorticoids (2 mg/kg). Together with the stress caused by hospitalization and daily paracenthesis, glucocorticoids might be a more confounding factor.48, 49 Potentially, a lower dose of glucocorticoids, or no glucocorticoids at all, might be better for \u201clong\u2010term\u201d treatment. The beneficial effects of glucocorticoids in the treatment of FIP must be questioned given the median survival time is 8\u20139 days in the present and in the previous study,3 both in treatment and placebo groups.3 Therefore, future treatment study protocols should include a 3rd group of cats that receive no glucocorticoids.

As this was a blinded, randomized trial, the distribution could not be influenced. Another limitation might be the small number of cats (only 2) without initial effusion. Definitive diagnosis in cats without effusion, however, is much more difficult to obtain.33 The PPF might be more useful in cats without effusion, as it may have a chance to prevent vasculitis and therefore effusions",
