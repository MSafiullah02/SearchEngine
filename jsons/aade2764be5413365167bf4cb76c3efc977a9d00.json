Also, the lack of vaccines and efficacious drugs to treat infected patients is a great problem to cope this pandemic. The approved drugs for similar health problems, reported potential drugs but not yet approved clinically or under clinical trial, and molecules from medicinal plants extracts are investigated randomly to deal with the COVID-19 infection. Molecular docking, one of the best approach to search therapeutically potent drugs/molecules in real time with possible hope to apply on COVID-19. In this communication, molecular docking studies of 18 ligands were carried out with the three important proteins of SARS-CoV-2, i.e., RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and spike glycoprotein (SGp). From the obtained results, we observed that all the tested molecules showed better dock score in compared to the hydroxychloroquine claimed to be effective against COVID-19. Combining the dock score and other medicinal properties, we believe the limonin can be further explored for potential use against COVID-19.",

This disease also reported to show other symptoms like muscle aches, loss of smell, fatigue and abdominal pain. The SARS-CoV-2 virus attacks the T lymphocytes of a lung that destroy the protecting proteins and builds up unwanted fluids within the lung causing difficulty in breathing [5] . After the first infected patient detected in Wuhan, China in December, 2019 with COVID-19, the virus spread globally due to its high contagious nature and became an ongoing pandemic. The virus generally spread from the infected person through close contact along with the droplets spilled during talking, coughing and sneezing [6] . After infection with the virus, the symptoms likely to appear within two to fourteen days that depends on the age of person and weak immunity due to other illness like diabetes, asthma, heart ailment etc. [7] . The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was declared as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) and a pandemic respectively on 30 th Jan 2020 and 11 th March 2020 by World Health Organization The non-availability of recommended drugs or vaccines to deal with the COVID-19 along with the quick human to human transmission is the main cause of this pandemic. Therefore, at present scenario, efforts have been made to identify the infected persons through rapid diagnosis followed by quarantine them to stop the further spread of this disease. Also, other recommended steps such as using masks, washing hands with soap and maintaining social distancing are suggested to control the spread of this virus. Simultaneously, the approved drugs for similar health problems, reported potential drugs but not yet approved clinically or under clinical trial, and molecules from medicinal plants extracts are investigated randomly to deal 3 with the COVID-19 infection. In searching drugs/molecules from a library that contained in lakhs, the computational approaches like molecular docking, screening, simulations etc. can save money and expedite the research on drug discovery for COVID-19 [10] . In this work, we have performed molecular docking studies of total 18 molecules with the three important proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The main drug hydroxychloroquine studied here is claimed effective against the SARS-CoV-2 [11] and therefore, its dock score compared with the other tested molecules. From the obtained results, we observed that all the tested molecules showed better dock score in compared to the hydroxychloroquine and overall, the molecule from limonoid family (i.e. limonin) can be further explored for potential use against COVID-19.",

Limonin, the first isolated limonoid found in citrus fruits with bitter taste is known to inhibit the replication of retroviruses like HTLV-I and HIV- 12 1. Other important limonoid like azadirachtin is found in neem leaves and seeds. In Traditional Indian medicine, neem leaves are largely used for various medications (exceptionally some people shows allergy due to the bitter taste). Many other limonoids are also known for their potential biological activities.

The Average G-factor score of ACE2 (2GHV.pdb) is -0.04.10 The spike glycoproteins (SGp) having multiple chains in which we focused on a specific chain played a vital role in binding with host ACE2 receptor and bind to TMPRSS2 receptor to activate the virus-host interactions showing in Fig. 1. Spike protein1, this helps in attaching the virus to the cell membrane of the human receptor ACE2 and CLEC4M/DC-SIGNR. This also internalizes the virus into the endosomes where the conformational changes take place in the spike glycoprotein. Limonin showing good interactions to SGp chainE residues with \u03c0-alkyl interactions to Val394, Arg395, chainC: pro399, Tyr367. There are conventional hydrogen bond interactions to chainE: Thr363, Ser358, Lys365, chainC: Gln401, and Van der Waals interactions with chainE: Tyr494, Gly391, Ile489, Ser362, chainC: Ala398 (Fig. 4). These interactions may collectively inhibit the functions of spike1. By achieving the blockage of spike1 functional protein will suppress the activity of binding to host. These binding sites having hydrophobic surfaces including chainE: Gly368, Tyr494, Asn424, Thr359, Trp423, Ser358, Phe360, Tyr367, Phe361, Van der Waals interactions, the minimum binding energy -8.4 kcal/mol indicates the limonin plays a crucial role in inhibiting the spike glycoproteins.
