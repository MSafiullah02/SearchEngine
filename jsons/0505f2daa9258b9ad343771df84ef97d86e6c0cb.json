However, while foreign-targeted English language operations of these trolls have received significant attention, no research has analyzed their Russian language domestic and regional-targeted activities. This is despite the fact that half of the tweets in the Twitter-released data are in Russian. We address this gap by characterizing the Russian-language operations of Russian trolls using the Twitter data. We first take a broad view with a descriptive and temporal analysis, and then focus in on the trolls' operation related to the crash of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, one of the deadliest incidents in the conflict in Ukraine.",

The main political sentiments of such campaigns are praising Russia and Putin (29%), criticizing Ukraine (26%), and criticizing the United States (US) along with Obama (9%). Further, we discovered that trolls actively reshared information. Namely, 76% of tweets were retweets or contained a URL. Particularly often trolls distributed the news of mainstream media. Additionally, we observe periodic temporal patterns of tweet arrival, with three distinct periods that change over time, suggesting that trolls use automation tools for posting. Further, we find that trolls' information campaign on the MH17 crash was the largest in terms of tweet count. However, around 68% of tweets posted with MH17 hashtags were likely used simply for hashtag amplification. With these tweets excluded, about 49% of the tweets suggested to varying levels that Ukraine was responsible for the crash, and only 13% contained disinformation and propaganda presented as news. Interestingly, trolls promoted inconsistent alternative theories for the incident. Namely, half of the false news tweets suggested that Ukraine downed the plane with an air-to-air missile, whereas 23% promoted the ground-to-air missile version.",

The third group of studies often uses linguistic features (such as features common to native Russian speakers in English-language conversations) to detect trolls [5, 11] , although some studies (e.g., [16] ) use a broader set of features for troll detection, including profile-, behavior-, and stop word usage-related features. Quantitative troll studies could further be divided into those taking a broad scope, and those focusing on a particular propaganda campaign, most often the 2016 US Elections [1, 3, 5, 15, 17, 20] and Brexit [14, 21] .

Moreover, they post shorter tweets with shorter words, use fewer words that indicate causation, and use less emojis [1, 5] . Furthermore, the trolls differ from each other. For example, [20] identified five groups of trolls based on their behavior: right troll, left troll, news feed, hashtag gamer, and fearmonger.

Shortly after the incident, western media accused separatists from the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) of shooting down the plane with Buk Missile System. In turn, the separatists and some Russian media stated that Ukrainian Armed Forces were to blame [24] . The results of a criminal investigation by the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) published in September 2016 indicated that the Buk missile system was transported from Russia to territory controlled by separatists the day before the incident [26] . The crash of MH17 sparked an intense debate on social media. In [13] , the authors collected tweets related to the incident and manually marked a sample of English-language tweets based on the judgements they expressed. 10.3% of tweets appeared to be pro-Ukrainian, and 5.5% -pro-Russian, while the rest did not take a side. The authors found that pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian tweets were mostly spread by accounts identified as ordinary citizens rather than media figures or politicians. However, they did not consider the role of trolls in the discussion. Furthermore, no academic studies have analyzed how trolls reacted to the crash of MH17.",

            "text": "Similar to the previous work for English-language troll tweets [35] , we find that the most common Russian hashtag is #News (\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438), which accounts for 4.96% of all hashtags used by trolls (9.47%, p < 0.01, for hashtags used by English language trolls). Other popular apolitical hashtags include #Auto (\u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e), #Sport (\u0421\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442), and #Cinema (\u041a\u0438\u043d\u043e). Furthermore, several top hashtags relate to and Ukraine (#PanicInKiev -\u041f\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0412\u041a\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0435). Interestingly, one of the top hashtags (#RunZelensky -\u0417\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439\u0411\u0435\u0433\u0438) refers to Vladimir Zelensky, then a well-known figure in Russian media who was later elected as the president of Ukraine. Overall, we observe more event-and person-specific along with politically colored hashtags than in the 20 hashtags most used in Englishlanguage operations. Further, we check whether hashtags can indicate propaganda campaigns run by Russian trolls. To detect such propaganda hashtag campaigns, we first select hashtags used by trolls more than 500 times (303 hashtags) with at least 95% of their occurrences happened within one month (165 hashtags). Further, we explore tweets containing the selected hashtags and manually classify them based on their subject and sentiment. Some of the campaigns included several hashtags; we remove such duplicates (8 hashtags). Further, some hashtag campaigns had two subjects and sentiments, for example, attacking Ukraine and praising Russia simultaneously. In such cases, two subjects and sentiments are marked (7 campaigns). three were related to the European Union sanctions targeting Russia (e.g., #AgainstSanctions -\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0439), two were against Canada (e.g., #nocanada in November 2014), two attacked Turkey and were related to a Russian military jet downed by Turkey in Syria in November 2015 (e.g., #TurkeyAggressor), and one criticized Armenia for demonstrations in June 2015 (#YerevanBeSmart). Several campaigns attacked particular Russian and foreign figures (e.g., #SomeoneWhoKillsChildren against the then president of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko). Further, about 18% of all hashtag campaigns were apolitical. More than half of such hashtags appeared in October-December 2014, when anti-Ukraine campaigns were on the decline. Finally, among the miscellaneous hashtags with varying subjects and sentiments, three were pro-Ukraine campaigns run in February 2015 related to the Minsk II agreement 5 (e.g., #MinskHope -\u041c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f\u041d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0430); two were anti-LGBT campaigns from July 2015 (e.g., #StopLGBT -\u0421\u0442\u043e\u043f\u041b\u0413\u0411\u0422), and several campaigns addressed internal Russian events. For example, in December 2014 trolls blamed speculators for the Russian Ruble depreciation (#Speculators -\u0421\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044f\u043d\u0442\u044b).",

We further observe that burstiness varied over the years. Namely, in 2014, posting patterns were the most periodic with a median B = \u22120.73, whereas in 2015 and 2016 the median burstiness increased to \u22120.38 and \u22120.36, respectively, potentially indicating a lower degree of the automation use.",

Furthermore, we only select tweets posted from 17.07.2014 14:00 (approximate time of the plane crash) until the end of July 2014. This results in 71023 tweets, 92.4% of which were posted with at least one of the three mentioned hashtags, making the operation one of the largest run by the Russian trolls. This observation is in line with [32] . The content of tweets was often exactly the same for each of the three campaign hashtags. Nevertheless, perhaps due to space restrictions, most troll tweets used only one of the hashtags. Figure 7 shows the number of troll tweets related to the crash of MH17 published between 14:00 17.07 and 14:00 20.07, as 99% of the such tweets fall into this interval. The hashtag campaigns started at around 9:00 on 18.07 and ended abruptly at around 12:00 on 19.07. The mean tweet rate during the campaign was 2484 tweets per hour, 9.4 times higher than the mean for July 2014. The mean hourly number of active trolls during the MH17 campaign was around 288, compared to 98 over all of July 2014. Table 4 shows the tweets that trolls posted during the first several hours after the crash including the tweet time (UTC) and the number of similar tweets posted within 10 minutes of each first tweet. This can show whether tweet posting was coordinated.",

Many tweets combined two or three of such sentences, e.g., \"There are as many opinions as there are people. Why shoot down a civilian plane? Ukrops went totally nuts\". Interestingly, some of these common sentences were also used in other anti-Ukrainian and anti-USA hashtag campaigns later on, such as #ReturnCalifornia (\u0412\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u041a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0438\u044e) in September 2014 and #BattleOfOligarchs (\u0411\u0438\u0442\u0432\u0430\u041e\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0445\u043e\u0432) in March 2015.

Next we cluster tweets using agglomerative hierarchical clustering. Average linkage is selected as it produces the most persuasive clusters. We test several cluster cut-off levels from 0.3 to 0.7 in increments of 0.05 and compare the resulting clusters using the silhouette coefficient. Lower cut-off levels result in a higher silhouette score but also larger numbers of clusters, particularly singletons. Therefore, we choose the cut-off level of 0.5 as a trade-off resulting in a reasonably small number of clusters for hand-coding (n = 873, including 200 singletons) and an acceptable silhouette coefficient (0.44) 9 .",

About 73% of such tweets suggest that Ukraine downed the plane and 21% say that Ukraine is responsible at least indirectly (e.g., by allowing the plane to fly over the war zone or by escalating the conflict in Ukraine). Further, 3% blame Ukraine for interfering with the crash investigation, mainly by bombing the crash site.

However, 23% of news tweets (13% of all DR tweets) contain disinformation or propaganda. Table 6 shows the main narratives of such tweets. About half of the disinformation suggests that a Ukrainian fighter aircraft downed the plane. According to trolls, the size of debris indicated that the plane was downed by an air-to-air missile. Trolls further referred to a statement from Spanish air-traffic controller's working in Kiev, which claimed to have seen a military aircraft escorting MH17 11 . About 23.1% of disinformation tweets suggest that Ukraine downed the plane from the ground, with 11.8% not openly blaming but stating that Ukraine relocated their Buk missile systems to the location of the missile launch a day before the crash. Interestingly, two contradicting disinformation campaigns (Ukrainians shot down the plane by an air-to-air vs. ground-to-air missile) were run in parallel. Overall, trolls' tweets seem to reflect the changing and contradicting narratives of the Russian government on MH17 [29] . Furthermore, 21.4% of disinformation and propaganda tweets use other narratives to blame Ukraine. Trolls suggested that the incident was a planned operation, and that the President of Ukraine knew about the crash before it happened because his reaction to the crash was so fast. Finally, about 5.6% of disinformation tweets do not blame Ukraine, including a few posts where trolls confused MH17 for a military AN-26 (see Table 4 ) and a few tweets with experts supporting conspiracy theories.",

Nevertheless, at least eight out of the top 20 hashtags in Russian were related to politics, compared with three for English-language operations [35] . This difference is mainly due to the \"hashtag campaigns\" that Russian-language trolls often ran, which accounted for six of the eight political hashtags, and which did not seem to be common in English-language operations. A potential motivation for such campaigns is to increase the hashtag visibility in the country-specific Twitter trends. Therefore, a hashtag campaign is more sensible in the smaller Russian domain of Twitter rather than a larger English language domain.",
