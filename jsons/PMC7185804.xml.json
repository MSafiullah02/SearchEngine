PEDV is a causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), a devastating enteric disease characterized by watery diarrhea, dehydration and high mortality in pigs younger than one week of age (Pensaert and De Bouck, 1978). PED was first reported in Belgium and the United Kingdom in 1976\u20131978 (Chasey and Cartwright, 1978, Pensaert and De Bouck, 1978, Wood, 1977). The disease was subsequently reported in several Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and Thailand, and became endemic, causing significant welfare and economic problems (Li et al., 2012, Park et al., 2007a, Song and Park, 2012, Temeeyasen et al., 2014, Vui et al., 2015). Since 2013, there has been an emergence of a highly virulent PEDV in the North American continent and its subsequent reports from several countries worldwide.",

            "text": "The genome of PEDV is approximately 28 kb in length and comprises seven open reading frames (ORFs): ORF1a and ORF1b, spike (S), ORF3, envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N) (Kocherhans et al., 2001). Two thirds of the genome is occupied by ORF1a and ORF1b, which encode nonstructural proteins. The other 4 structural proteins, S, E, M, and N, are located downstream of the ORF1a/1b gene. ORF3 is located between S and E and encodes an accessory protein. The S gene encodes S glycoprotein, which can be divided into the S1 and S2 domains. The S glycoprotein plays an important role in binding to specific host cell receptors. The S1 domain of S glycoprotein stimulates the production of neutralizing antibodies by the host (Chang et al., 2002, Cruz et al., 2006, Cruz et al., 2008, Duarte and Laude, 1994, Sun et al., 2008, Sun et al., 2007). The ORF3 gene is the only accessory gene and is an important determinant of virulence in PEDV (Park et al., 2008, Park et al., 2007b). Vaccine-derived isolates have a unique deletion of 17 amino acids at positions 82 to 99 (Park et al., 2008, Park et al., 2007b). The other E and M genes are associated with viral envelope formation and release (Kocherhans et al., 2001). The N protein is the predominate antigen produced in coronavirus-infected cells and is thus a major viral target (Kocherhans et al., 2001). Two PEDV variants, classic and pandemic, are currently recognized (Sun et al., 2015) which typed as genogroups 1 and 2, respectively (Chen et al., 2014), and can be distinguished by the spike gene. The pandemic variant contains two insertions of 4 (56GENQ59) and 1 (140N) amino acids at positions 55\u201360 and 140, respectively, and a deletion of 2 amino acids (160DG161) at positions 160\u2013161 (Li et al., 2012).",

The supernatants were filtered through 0.45-\u03bcm filters and stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C before use. PEDV was isolated from PEDV supernatant samples using a continuous Vero cell line (ATCC, CCL-81).",

For ORF3 analysis, a chain length of 10 million generations sampled every 1000 generations was applied. Tracer v1.5 (http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Tracer) was used to confirm that the post-burn-in trees yielded an effective sample size (ESS) of > 200 for all parameters.

The two PEDV variants were isolated from a herd that experienced two episodes of PED outbreak 4 months apart in 2014. The isolates responsible for the first and second PED outbreaks were CBR1/2014 and EAS1/2014, respectively. To determine the genetic relationships of the 2 PEDV variants, phylogenetic analyses of the whole genome, and spike and ORF genes were separately constructed, and the results demonstrated that the two PEDV variants were groups in a different cluster in all 3 trees constructed. A previous report demonstrated that PEDV isolated in Thailand in 2007\u20132013 was grouped in cluster G2, the pandemic group (Temeeyasen et al., 2014). CBR1/2014 clustered in cluster G2, suggesting that the isolate is an endemic Thai PEDV variant. By contrast, EAS1/2014, the PEDV isolate detected in the second outbreak, clustered in G1, the classical variant group, and is more genetically related to LZC, SM98 and CV777. These findings suggest that EAS1/2014 is a novel isolate recently isolated in Thailand and may have been externally introduced into the herd to cause the second outbreak, rather than the product of continuing evolution of existing PEDV in the herd. The antigenic distinction and route of introduction remain to be further elucidated.",

We therefore explored the antigenic differences between the CBR1/2014 and EAS1/2014 isolates, particularly the S and ORF3 genes, which encode neutralizing epitopes and attenuation markers, respectively.

In addition, differences between these two variants were identified at amino acid position 504\u2013643 and 769\u2013776, which encode neutralizing epitopes (Chang et al., 2002, Cruz et al., 2008, Sun et al., 2008).

Vaccine-derived isolates have a unique deletion of 17 amino acids at positions 82\u201399 (Park et al., 2008, Park et al., 2007b).

In ORF1, the regions between nt 2995\u20133090 are the hypervariable region between the nsp2 and nsp3 genes and are reported to be the putative region for a recombination event (Huang et al., 2013). The positive selection in the N gene is consistent with a recent finding suggesting that the N gene also contains a hypervariable region. Interestingly, the S and ORF3 genes were neutrally selected even though both genes have hypervariable regions. This neutral evolution indicates that the evolution was due to mutation and antigenic drift, not genetic selection. The neutral selection in the S and ORF3 genes suggests that the virus was externally introduced rather than continuously evolved in the population, resulting in the emergence of a novel viral isolate.",
