Furthermore, it has been reported that the promoter of IFN-\u03bbR1 contains a binding site for the IFN-\u03b1 signal transducer STAT1 (Yang et al., 2010). We therefore tested whether IFN-\u03bbR1 is an ISG in PHHs. Indeed, we found a significant induction of IFN-\u03bbR1 both on the transcript and the protein level within hours after IFN-\u03b1 stimulation (Fig. 2, A and B). The IFN-\u03b1\u2013induced up-regulation of IFN-\u03bbR1 had important consequences for the responsiveness of PHHs to IFN-\u03bb2. Treatment-naive PHHs showed poor to absent phosphorylation of STAT1 in response to 100 ng/ml IFN-\u03bb2. The response was significantly enhanced after the induction of IFN-\u03bbR1 through a pretreatment of PHHs with IFN-\u03b1 (Fig. 2, C and D).",

The parent Huh7 clone used for these experiments has very low IFN-\u03bbR1 expression and consequently showed only weak phosphorylation of STAT1 upon IFN-\u03bb2 treatment and absent or only very weak induction of ISGs (Fig. 3, C and D). LR clones 1, 2, and 3 had stepwise increased expression levels of IFN-\u03bbR1 and showed corresponding increases in Jak\u2013STAT activation and ISG induction by IFN-\u03bb2 (Fig. 3, C and D). Of note, a significant increase in responses to IFN-\u03bb2 was only observed in clones with IFN-\u03bbR1 expression of >0.005 relative to GAPDH. Interestingly, IFN-\u03bb2\u2013induced ISG expression in LR clone 2 and 3 cells increased over time during a 24-h treatment period (Fig. 3 D). This is in contrast to the IFN-\u03b1\u2013induced ISG expression that is typically transient because of the well-known refractoriness of IFN-\u03b1 signal transduction pathways in Huh7 cells and liver cells (Larner et al., 1986; Sarasin-Filipowicz et al., 2009; Makowska et al., 2011). In accordance with these published results, IFN-\u03b1 induced only transient phosphorylation of STAT1 (Fig. 3 E). Contrariwise, IFN-\u03bb signaling showed no refractoriness but prolonged stimulation of the Jak\u2013STAT pathway in LR clone 3 cells (Fig. 3 E).",

To investigate the mechanisms responsible for the association of the IFN-\u03bb3 genotype with IFN-\u03bbR1 expression, we genotyped PHH samples from 30 donors not infected with HCV (Table S1), stimulated them for 4 h with IFN-\u03b1, and measured the mRNA expression of IFN-\u03bbR1 and two well-characterized ISGs, i.e., STAT1 and RSAD2. In unstimulated PHHs, the expression of all three genes was low, independent of the IFN-\u03bb3 genotype (Fig. 4, B and C). IFN-\u03b1 treatment resulted in a significant induction of all three genes in all samples. For STAT1 and RSAD2, the magnitude of gene induction was not significantly associated with the IFN-\u03bb3 genotype. Contrariwise, there was a significantly stronger induction of IFN-\u03bbR1 in samples having one or two minor IFN-\u03bb3 alleles (Fig. 4, B and C).",

There were 21 samples from patients who had a sustained virological response defined as the absence of detectable HCV RNA in the serum 6 mo after the end of the treatment. 27 samples were from patients who did not respond to peg-IFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin and remained HCV RNA positive. The median expression of IFN-\u03bbR1 measured as copies per 40 ng of total RNA was 732 in pretreatment biopsy samples from nonresponder patients (Fig. 5). In the responders, the median expression was 514. The difference was statistically significant (Mann\u2013Whitney test, P < 0.05). We conclude that the response to treatment with peg-IFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin negatively correlates with expression levels of IFN-\u03bbR1 in the liver.",

The method was previously used and validated in liver biopsies with different fibrosis stages including cirrhosis (Duong et al., 2004). The activation of the Jak\u2013STAT pathway was assessed by immunostaining of fresh-frozen biopsy material with phospho-STAT1\u2013specific antibodies. For each sample, confocal microscope pictures of three random fields were obtained and used to quantify the number of nuclei with phospho-STAT1 signals. The expression of IFN-\u03bbR1 was quantified by qPCR. Two liver biopsies from uninfected patients were used as controls. In these samples, IFN-\u03b1 induced nuclear phospho-STAT1 signals in most cells, predominantly in hepatocytes, whereas IFN-\u03bb was ineffective (Fig. 6, A and B). The same response pattern was observed in samples from patients with CHC and low expression of the IFN-\u03bbR1 (Figs. 7 A and 8). The results were strikingly different in biopsies with high expression levels of IFN-\u03bbR1. In many of these samples, nuclear phospho-STAT1 signals were detectable already in the PBS samples, and IFN-\u03b1 rarely elicited further responses. On the contrary, IFN-\u03bb was able to increase nuclear phospho-STAT1 signals in all nine biopsy samples with high IFN-\u03bbR1 (Figs. 7 B and 8). Based on these ex vivo data, we conclude that there is an inverse correlation between responsiveness to IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03bb in human liver of patients with CHC. Thus, we propose that patients with high-level pretreatment expression of ISGs in the liver, who according to previously published work often respond poorly to IFN-\u03b1 (Chen et al., 2005; Asselah et al., 2008; Sarasin-Filipowicz et al., 2008; Dill et al., 2011), might indeed have better responses to IFN-\u03bb because of significantly increased expression of IFN-\u03bbR1.",

            "text": "The discovery that genetic variants near the IFN-\u03bb3 gene locus are strongly associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV by the host immune system and with response to therapy of CHC with peg-IFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin was an important milestone in HCV research (Ge et al., 2009; Suppiah et al., 2009; Tanaka et al., 2009; Rauch et al., 2010). IFN-\u03bb (IL28B) genotyping rapidly became a useful tool for clinicians for predicting the likelihood of treatment response of an individual patient, and it became essential for stratifying patients enrolled in clinical treatment trials with peg-IFN-\u03b1\u2013containing regimens. The discovery was also important for basic research of host\u2013virus interactions because it identified the previously neglected IFN-\u03bb system as a key component of the host immune answer to HCV. However, the mechanisms that link IFN-\u03bb3 genotypes with spontaneous HCV clearance and with response to peg-IFN-\u03b1 remained elusive. Important insights came from studies that linked IFN-\u03bb3 genotypes with hepatic ISG expression in CHC (Honda et al., 2010; Urban et al., 2010). Differential activation of the endogenous IFN system in the liver has previously been established as a major determinant of response to peg-IFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin (Chen et al., 2005; Asselah et al., 2008; Sarasin-Filipowicz et al., 2008). Patients with an activated IFN system are generally poor responders to peg-IFN-\u03b1 therapy. Therefore, an increased production and secretion of IFN-\u03bb from minor alleles compared with major IFN-\u03bb3 alleles would be an obvious explanation for the association of the minor IFN-\u03bb3 alleles with increased ISG expression in the liver. However, several groups have failed to find increased expression levels of IFN-\u03bb family members in the serum or the liver of patients with minor IFN-\u03bb3 alleles (Honda et al., 2010; Urban et al., 2010; Dill et al., 2011). In the present work, we provide evidence that the link between the IFN-\u03bb3 genotype and hepatic ISG expression is based on differential expression of the IFN-\u03bbR1 receptor, and not by differential induction of the IFN-\u03bb ligands. The receptor is detectably expressed in all liver biopsies. The median expression value is significantly higher in samples from patients with CHC, and within the group of CHC samples, there is significantly increased expression in patients carrying the minor IFN-\u03bb3 allele (compared with the major allele) and in patients who were nonresponders to peg-IFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin therapy (compared with patients who were cured by this treatment). These results are in accordance with previous published results showing an elevated expression of IFNLR1 in patients with CHC infection compared with controls and in Huh7.5 cells infected with HCVcc (cell culture\u2013derived infectious HCV; Dolganiuc et al., 2012; Kohli et al., 2012).",

            "text": "The ligands (IFN-\u03bb1, -2, and -3) were consistently undetectable in liver biopsies from patients not infected with HCV. In CHC patients, IFN-\u03bb1 and -\u03bb2/3 are detected by qPCR in about half of the samples, mostly at low expression levels. In agreement with published work, we did not find a correlation between IFN-\u03bb expression and response to treatment or the IFN-\u03bb3 genotype. We therefore think that we can exclude differential regulation of IFN-\u03bb1 and -\u03bb2/3 as the missing link between the IFN-\u03bb3 genotype and ISG expression. A very interesting alternative explanation has been generated by the recent discovery of a frame shift variant located upstream of the IFN-\u03bb3 gene (Prokunina-Olsson et al., 2013). This variant creates a new open reading frame of 179 aa that has been designated IFN-\u03bb4. Despite considerable sequence diversity between IFN-\u03bb4 and the other members of the IFN-\u03bb family, recombinant IFN-\u03bb4 signals through the IFN-\u03bbR to induce an antiviral state against HCV and coronaviruses (Hamming et al., 2013). It is immediately obvious that the exclusive production of IFN-\u03bb4 from the minor IFN-\u03bb3 alleles (more precisely from the ss469415590-\u0394G allele) together with the stronger induction of IFN-\u03bbR1 in the liver of patients with one or two minor alleles (Fig. 4) provide an attractive explanation for the high level of ISG expression in these patients. For the moment, however, our attempts to detect IFN-\u03bb4 mRNA in liver biopsies failed. Thus, further investigations are needed to clarify whether IFN-\u03bb4 is indeed the cytokine responsible for elevated ISG expression in patients with CHC.",

            "text": "Despite the fact that IFN-\u03bbs are not detectable in a substantial percentage of patients with CHC, we think that the IFN-\u03bb system is the most likely candidate for the continuous up-regulation of hundreds of ISGs in preactivated patients. Contrary to IFN-\u03b1 signaling, IFN-\u03bb signaling does not become refractory during prolonged stimulation (Fig. 3 D; Makowska et al., 2011). Moreover, the strength of IFN-\u03bb\u2013induced activation of the Jak\u2013STAT pathway is regulated to a large degree by the expression of the IFN-\u03bbR1 (Figs. 2, 3, 7, and 8). Because IFN-\u03bbR1 is an ISG itself, the IFN-\u03bb system can undergo a positive feedback loop that can be maintained as long as there is a minimal amount of IFN-\u03bb ligands to stimulate the expression of IFN-\u03bbR1. In this context, our observation that PHHs from non-HCV\u2013infected donors show a differential induction of IFN-\u03bbR1 upon IFN-\u03b1 stimulation according to their IFN-\u03bb3 genotype (Fig. 4, B and C) provides an important missing link between genotype and phenotype. We propose that early during HCV infection the host innate immune system reacts with the induction of type I (IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b2) and/or III (IFN-\u03bb) IFN. In individuals with one or two minor IFN-\u03bb3 alleles, there is a strong induction of the IFN-\u03bbR1. This induction is maintained through a positive feedback loop, and IFN-\u03bbR1 remains constitutively induced together with hundreds of other ISGs. In this group of patients, peg-IFN-\u03b1 is ineffective, most likely because of the permanent induction of the ISG USP18, a strong inhibitor of signaling through the IFN-\u03b1 receptor (Sarasin-Filipowicz et al., 2009; Fran\u00e7ois-Newton et al., 2011; Dill et al., 2012). On the other side, in patients homozygous for the major IFN-\u03bb3 allele, the induction of IFN-\u03bbR1 remains below a critical threshold for the positive feedback loop, and ISG induction fades away. These non-preactivated patients are highly responsive to peg-IFN-\u03b1, most likely because IFN-\u03b1 signaling is not refractory.",

A phase 1b and a phase 2b study demonstrated antiviral activity in patients with CHC and minimal adverse events and hematologic effects (Muir et al., 2010; Muir, A.J., et al. 2012). The 63rd Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases: The Liver Meeting. Abstr. 214). The better tolerability of peg-IFN-\u03bb1 is presumably caused by the restricted tissue distribution of its receptor. Lymphocytes or monocytes are unresponsive to IFN-\u03bb (Dickensheets et al., 2013). The antiviral activity of peg-IFN-\u03bb1 is probably mediated through a direct stimulation of the IFN-\u03bb receptor on hepatocytes. In tissue blots, IFN-\u03bbR1 is detectable in the liver (Sheppard et al., 2003), and IFN-\u03bb had antiviral activity and/or activated Jak\u2013STAT signaling in several hepatoma cells lines and PHHs, albeit often with lower efficacy compared with IFN-\u03b1 (Robek et al., 2005; Doyle et al., 2006; Marcello et al., 2006; Dickensheets et al., 2013). In vivo, the response to IFN-\u03bb in the human liver has not been investigated. Interestingly, in the mouse liver, we and others have found very little IFN-\u03bbR1 expression and little to absent Jak\u2013STAT stimulation in the liver in response to systemic application of mouse IFN-\u03bb (Sommereyns et al., 2008; Makowska et al., 2011).",

This differential expression can be explained by the fact that IFN-\u03bbR1 is an ISG. The association of IFN-\u03bbR1 expression with the IFN-\u03bb3 minor allele has important consequences for the use of peg-IFN-\u03bb1 for the treatment of CHC. Collectively with the results from our ex vivo stimulation experiments (Figs. 7 and 8), the findings provide a rationale for the preferential use of peg-IFN-\u03bb1 in patients with an induced hepatic IFN system who are usually responding poorly to the current standard of care treatment regiments that contain peg-IFN-\u03b1. On the negative side, peg-IFN-\u03bb1 could have only limited efficiency in patients with an uninduced endogenous IFN system because of a below-threshold expression of the IFN-\u03bb receptor. A quantification of IFN-\u03bbR1 mRNA in liver biopsies could therefore help to select the most promising peg-IFN (peg-IFN-\u03b1 vs. peg-IFN-\u03bb) to be included in the treatment regimens of individual patients.",
