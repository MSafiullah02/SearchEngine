            "text": "Transmission of infectious diseases exhibits spatial and temporal variations of incidence that reflects seasons, interannual weather fluctuations, strong single weather events, and other natural disasters [1\u2022, 2]. \u2192Climate,1\nthe average weather of a region, is primarily driven by seasonal variables such as temperature, precipitation, and winds. In interannual time scales, there is superimposing variability due to a number of coupled ocean/atmosphere systems. Best studied of which is the \u2192El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), but roughly a dozen circulation indices also contribute ([3\u2022] and literature cited therein). Climate of the Northern Hemisphere is further driven by the \u2192Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and the \u2192Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) that are quasiperiodic long-term fluctuations (up to 50\u201380 years) in the strength of thermohaline circulation [3\u2022]. A fourth factor gained growing importance in recent years: the increase of the global temperature, apparently an unidirectional trend that is supposed to induce a gradual but significant \u2192climate change. It is assumed that global warming is forced by the anthropogenic release of \u2018greenhouse gases\u2019 [4\u2022]. A consistent assumption was to predict increased exposure of humans to tropical pathogens and their vectors. In 1991, Robert Shope presented the hypothesis that global climate change might result in a worldwide increase of zoonotic infectious diseases [5\u2022], and others forwarded this intriguing idea (inter alia [6\u2022]). Meanwhile, the rising incidences of many human diseases and the emergence/re-emergence of more than a dozen infectious diseases were perceived and Shope's hypothesis attracted attention of numerous scientists. In addition, the impact of global warming on infectious diseases was also considered in the Assessment Reports of the \u2192Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC [7\u2022]. Vector-borne infectious diseases, for example malaria, yellow fever, dengue, and some viral encephalitides as well as non-vector-borne diseases, such as salmonellosis, cholera, and giardiasis, were predicted to increase, whereas LaCrosse encephalitis and Lyme borreliosis were expected to decline [5\u2022, 7\u2022]. However, there is dissent about this hypothesis [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Despite the great attention, only few research articles provide reliable data on the interconnection of global warming and the epidemiology of infectious diseases. It is our aim to confine this review to viral diseases and to describe some of those mechanisms that have lead to an increase of virus activity in recent years.Box 1Glossary\nAtlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, AMO: a quasiperiodic long-term fluctuation up to 50\u201380 years in the strength of thermohaline circulation that results in variability of sea surface temperatures in the range of 0.4 \u00b0C. Its warm phases extended from 1860 to 1880 and 1930 to 1960, cold phases were recorded 1905\u20131925 and 1970\u20131990. In 1995, the AMO index turned positive again, indicating another warm phase.\nClimate: average weather of a region; statistical description of mean and variability of surface variables (temperature, precipitation, wind) over a period of typically 30 years (as pinpointed by the World Meteorological Organization).Climate Change: changes in the mean and variability of climate variables that persist for comparable time periods (decades or longer). This definition includes both natural processes and anthropogenic changes.\nEl Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation, ENSO: a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon that drives a complex global system of meteorological pertubations. Its periodically warm event, El Ni\u00f1o, is characterized by a warm-water current along the western coast of equatorial South America. The trade winds normally blowing westwards show a weakening or reversal. This leads to an altering of ocean currents. The characteristic equatorial \u2018cold tongue\u2019 of upwelling cool water fails to develop and sea surface temperatures increase by four to five degrees at the equatorial eastern Pacific. As a consequence fluctuations of the Walker Circulation as well as changes in regional temperatures and precipitation patterns occur. El Ni\u00f1o is associated with high atmospheric pressure over Indonesia and low pressure over the southeastern Pacific (as measured by the Southern Oscillation index). Numerous teleconnections occur in far distant regions. The cold phase of the ENSO with reversed effects is called a La Ni\u00f1a event.\nIndian Ocean dipole, IOD: also known as Indian Ocean Zonal Mode [35, 36]; two modes of a zonal gradient of tropical SSTs during the boreal autumn. The positive mode is triggered by anomalous alongshore winds off Sumatra and the East African coast in summer that induce enhanced upwelling of cold water at Sumatra. In autumn, below-normal SSTs in Sumatra in the east and above-normal SSTs in Somalia in the west are accompanied with unusual easterly surface winds along the equator. Convectional rainfalls in autumn and winter due to moist air from the Indian Ocean ascending over the heated land mass of East Africa accompany the positive mode. The warming period ends or diminishes in a number of ways and results with the locus of convection moving back towards Indonesia and the equatorial wind pattern reverting its direction. The consequences are warm SSTs in the eastern Indian Ocean and cold SSTs in the western Indian Ocean (negative mode). Whether the IOD is linked to other coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomena (ENSO-monsoon system, North Pacific interdecadal variability) is still unclear [3\u2022].\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC: established in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme in order to assess scientific information related to climate change and to evaluate the environmental and socioeconomic consequences. Moreover, the IPCC was mandated to formulate realistic response strategies. So far, the IPCC produced four Assessment Reports (1990, 1995, 2001 and 2007), Special Reports, Technical Papers and Methodology Reports. The 4th Assessment Report (AR4) involved more than 500 Lead Authors and 2000 Expert Reviewers. The IPCC has been awarded the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize.\nPacific Decadal Oscillation, PDO: index of sea surface temperature fluctuations over the North Pacific north of 20\u00b0 used to measure the Pacific decadal variability, a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon with decadal-to-interdecadal fluctuations of sea surface temperatures, salinities, and atmospheric circulation throughout the whole Pacific Ocean. The ENSO cycle is modulated by the Pacific decadal variability.\nQuasi-Biennial Oscillation, QBO: large-scale climate fluctuation describing periodic variation in the direction, either westerly or easterly, of tropical lower stratospheric winds. The mean QBO cycle is 28 months but there is considerable variability of the period ranging from 20 to 36 months and the amplitude (maximum amplitude of 40\u201350 m/s is seen at 20 mb). The QBO has been linked to Southern Oscillation, Indian monsoons and precipitations in South Africa and Australia.\nSea surface temperature, SST: temperature of the top few meters of the ocean (subsurface bulk) as measured by ships and buoys. Satellite measurements of the uppermost layer have to be corrected for compatibility with the bulk temperature.",

            "text": "The IPCC has elaborated a plethora of adverse effects of climate change to stress its impact on human health [7\u2022]. This raises the question which of those effects will evoke serious problems and where? Following R. Shope's reasoning, \u2018three-factor and four-factor complexes\u2019 (i.e. arthropod-borne diseases and arthropod-borne zoonoses) are most likely to increase in the temperate countries [5\u2022]. He also anticipated the emergence of new diseases, like Lyme disease [5\u2022]. Seventeen years later, it can be stated that indeed most of the new viral diseases are zoonotics\u2014but none of them is arthropod-borne and none of them emerged due to climate change (Table 1\n)! However, quite a few re-emerging diseases are arthropod-borne and translocation of some pathogens lead to the dispersal of arthropod-borne diseases in remote areas. Those deserve a closer look (Table 2\n). In general, important factors that trigger the emergence/re-emergence of infectious diseases include population growth, migration, urbanization, international trade, poor socioeconomic conditions, famine, war, loss of biodiversity, deforestation, and land use change. Directly or indirectly, these factors either increase exposure of humans to pathogens or pose the societal problem to assure high levels of hygiene. Hence, several important viruses emerged independently of climate change, for example SARS virus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, and the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus. In modification of Shope's argumentation, one may conclude that mainly vector-borne, rodent-borne or water-borne diseases are due to the dependence on climate change because arthropod vectors, rodent hosts and water-transmitted pathogens are highly susceptible to weather variables.",

Only few pathogens of vector-borne diseases (e.g. dengue virus in America and Plasmodium falciparum) are strictly dependent on humans as a host, whereas most pathogens have the ability to productively infect a variety of hosts. Spreading of a disease occurs either by translocation or by dispersal of pathogen-infested vectors and hosts, and both modes may include anthropogenic contributions.",

Ae. aegypti was translocated by the early seafarers from Africa to tropical Asia and America and transmits a considerable number of viruses including the yellow fever virus and the four serotypes of dengue virus. The virus\u2013mosquito interactions are complex and exhibit region-specific characteristics. In the course of the yellow fever and malaria eradication programs in the 1960s, Aedes mosquitos were almost extinguished in the Americas, but after cessation of mosquito eradication efforts Ae. aegypti surged up again and extended its habitat [14]. In addition, the Asian mosquito Ae. albopictus was inadvertently translocated to Brazil and the USA in 1986 and spread mainly via the used tyre trade [15]. Notably, the recent epidemics of dengue and chikungunya fevers in the riparian states of the Indian Ocean and Italy as well as yellow fever outbreaks in America are associated with the upsurge of Ae. albopictus that readily allocates artificial vessels for breeding making it an ideal vector in urban areas [16\u2022, 17]. In addition, genetic changes of the chikungunya virus have been made responsible for its rapid replication in Ae. albopictus and its enhanced virulence [18\u2022].",

Both the incidental and inadvertent translocation of pathogens by migratory birds and lifestock transportation, respectively, gave rise to unexpected epidemics and epizootics in far distant regions [19, 20, 21, 22]. Prerequisite is the acquisition of suited vectors and host species by the pathogen in the new habitat. Spread of the Sindbis virus-like Ockelbo virus in Fennoscandia in the 1960s [23] and the very recent dispersal of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus by migrating birds from China through numerous countries of the Near and Middle East, Africa, and Europe [24] can be explained by the same mechanism. This mode is independent of climate change rather than its consequence.",

However, increased TBE incidences may have region-specific causes [12]. The recent upsurge of TBE is an example indicating what effects the dispersal and changing population densities of hosts and vectors could have on virus activity. Increase of roe deer density in Denmark (as in most other European countries) resulted in higher tick densities. Similarly, increased roe deer density in Sweden allowed ticks to expand their areas. As a consequence, the incidences of Lyme borreliosis in Denmark and TBE in Sweden were raised [12]. In countries succeeding the former Soviet Union, socioeconomic changes rather than elevated temperatures of recent years are a conclusive explanation for the upsurge of tick-borne diseases [25\u2022, 26].",

Hutcheon in 1902, after introduction of Merino sheep in South Africa. Since then, BTD is spreading! It is restricted to tropical and subtropical areas of Africa, Asia, and the Americas where competent vectors are present (between 35\u00b0S and 40\u00b0N). Dispersal of BTD is aggravated by three factors: firstly, a worldwide extension of stock-breeding, secondly, the replacement of resistant, indigenous domestic animals by improved cattle and sheep, and thirdly, the adaptation of the principle Old World vector of the bluetongue disease virus, Culicoides imicola, to the microclimate of lifestock holdings. In three waves, BTD re-emerged in South Europe (since 1998) via Turkey, Tunisia/Algeria and Morocco [27]. Re-emergence of BTD was attributed to global warming [28] as it is linked to the northward and westward expansion of C. imicola, a highly dispersive midge spreading to Europe from sub-Saharan areas and the Asian part of Turkey. In August 2006, BTD emerged for the first time in Central Europe [29\u2022]. Surprisingly, the etiologic agent was identified as an African strain of the bluetongue virus that has never been isolated in Europe before. The virus used indigenous Culicoides midges of the Obsoletus complex as a vector. How the virus reached Central Europe is obscure, but it appears that it was translocated inadvertently, whereas the South European virus strains spread naturally favored by both the wind-borne dispersal of infested vectors and the acquired competence of C. obsoletus after a couple of years with elevated temperatures in the past decade [27]. There is a striking co-incidence of former BTD outbreaks in Europe [30] and the USA and a previous warm phase of the AMO (Figure 1\n). It is unclear whether this time bluetongue virus stably establishes in Europe (e.g. owing to global warming).",

It appears that the PDO drives not only Pacific Ocean \u2192sea surface temperatures (SST) but also temperatures in America, Africa, and Asia. In its warm phase there are more El Ni\u00f1o events, whereas La Ni\u00f1a events dominate in the cold phase. A number of diseases including cholera, plague, malaria, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, and probably dengue fever in some Polynesian islands are ENSO-associated (Table 2). Occasionally, the Indian Ocean Dipole may modulate the impact of ENSO events in the Indian Ocean. This became evident when in 1997 a gradient of strong positive SST anomalies in the western Indian Ocean and negative SSTs in the eastern Indian Ocean forced torrential rains in East Africa whereas the drought in Indonesia was more intense as usual. In the next year, the seesaw swung to the eastern Indian Ocean and caused heavy precipitations in Southeast Asia [35, 36]. As a result, devastating epidemics of Rift Valley fever, cholera, and plague were recorded in East Africa in 1997 whereas dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, emerging Nipah encephalitis, and enterovirus 71 encephalitis afflicted Southeast Asia in the following year. Probably, a similarly strong dipole event unlinked to ENSO caused the Rift Valley fever epidemics of 1961\u20131963 in East Africa.",

Future research will unravel more of such links. For example, outbreaks of African horse sickness correlate with some, but not all ENSO events recorded in the past 200 years [37]. Coupled ocean/atmosphere circulations and continuous anthropogenic disturbances (increased populations of humans and domestic animals, socioeconomic instability, armed conflicts, displaced populations, unbalanced ecosystems, dispersal of resistant pathogens etc.) appear to be the major drivers of disease variability and global warming at best contributes.",
