It has been characterized under a variety of names in different species: rats (OX-47 antigen 1 and CE9 2 ), mice (gp42 3 and basigin 4 ), chickens (HT7 5 neurothelin and 5A11 antigen 6 ). In humans, this protein was first described by Biswas and colleagues as a factor made by tumour cells that stimulates production of a collagenase (matrix metalloproteinase type 1, MMP-1) by fibroblasts. 7, 8 This factor was identified and designated tumour cell-derived collagenase stimulatory factor (TCSF). 9 Later, it was found that TCSF is expressed not only on tumour, but also on normal cells. 10, 11 The same factor was described in other studies as hBasigin, M6, or Hab18G. 12, 13 It is best known under the name extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN), as this property of the protein has been most extensively studied. For consistency, in this review we will refer to this protein by its recently adopted designation, CD147. 14 CD147 is expressed at varying levels in many cell types, including haematopoietic, epithelial, endothelial cells and leukocytes. 1, 11, 15 The human CD147 is a 269 amino acid-long protein that belongs to the type I integral membrane protein family with a predicted molecular mass of 28 000 MW. 10 The N-terminal extracellular part of CD147 consists of two C2 type immunoglobulin-like domains, which are heavily glycosylated. Recently, another form of CD147, containing an additional extracellular membrane-distal immunoglobulin-like domain, has been characterized. 16 This form was shown to be responsible for the majority of homophilic CD147 interactions. Endoglycosidase F treatment leads to a mobility shift from 58 000 MW to 28 000 MW, suggesting that the majority of CD147 glycosylation is N-linked. 12 The 21-residue long transmembrane domain of CD147, represented by a hydrophobic stretch of amino acids interrupted by a charged residue, is almost identical among different species 17 suggesting its functional role beside anchoring CD147 in the membrane. Charged residues are not usually found in proteins spanning the membrane only once (as is the case for CD147), because a charged residue in the middle of the lipid bilayer is highly energetically unfavorable. This structural feature suggests that CD147 forms a complex with other membrane proteins thereby shielding the charge in an energetically stable state.

CD147 on tumour cells was shown to stimulate the production by fibroblasts of MMP-1 (collagenase), MMP-2 (gelatinase) and MMP-3 (stromelysin-1), but not tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 or TIMP-2. 37, 38 The synthesis of two out of three membrane-type MMPs (MT1-MMP, MT2-MMP, but not MT3-MMP) is also facilitated by CD147 in the human glioblastoma/ brain-tumour derived fibroblast and human melanoma/ dermal fibroblast cocultures. 39, 40 The mechanism of such stimulation is not fully understood, but involves phosphorylation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase 41 and depends, at least partially, on N-glycosylation of the CD147 extracellular domain. 42 Recent studies show that overexpression of CD147 in fibroblasts 43 or in tumour cells 44 also facilitates the MMP production within the same cell culture. It has been suggested that the transmembrane portion and the glycosylation status of the extracellular domain of CD147 may regulate this process. 43, 45 CD147 -/knock-out mice are defective in implantation, which may indicate a misregulation of MMP production. 46 A role for CD147 in cellular adhesion is suggested by its involvement in the blood-brain barrier 5, 47 and interaction with such adhesion molecules as integrins a3b1 and a6b1. 19, 22 Indeed, recent data demonstrate that CD147 expressed on erythrocytes acts as an adhesion molecule, which apparently plays a critical role in the recirculation of mature erythrocytes from the spleen into the general circulation. 48 Masking of CD147 on the surface of erythrocytes leads to their selective trapping in the spleen, induction of an anaemia, and consequently, de novo erythropoietinmediated erythropoiesis in this organ and in the bone marrow.

CD147 stimulates MMP production in stromal fibroblasts and endothelial cells around the tumour, as well as in tumour cells themselves, by a mechanism involving homophilic interactions between CD147 molecules on apposing cells after membrane vesicle shedding. 51, 52 Elevated CD147 levels were detected in numerous malignant tumours and have been correlated with tumour progression in experimental and clinical conditions. In addition, CD147 stimulates angiogenesis via induction of vascular endothelial cell growth factor, 53 invasiveness via stimulation of MMP 44 and multidrug resistance through hyaluronan-mediated up-regulation of ErbB2 signalling and cell survival pathway activities. 54, 55 In human hepatoma cells, CD147 was shown to regulate calcium entry by NO/cGMP pathway and, subsequently, govern the progression of metastasis. 13 Recently, CD147 has been proposed as a novel marker of poor outcome in serous ovarian carcinoma. 56 In support of its key role in the processes of tumorigenesis, CD147 was reported as one of the most constantly upregulated mRNAs in metastatic cells. 57 CD147 has been implicated also in many other pathological processes.

CD147 was picked up in our search for the receptor responsible for the extracellular activity of cyclophilin A (CyPA). CyPA is a ubiquitously expressed intracellular protein belonging to the immunophilin family 72 and is best known as the principal ligand for the potent immunosuppressive drug, cyclosporin (CsA). [73] [74] [75] CyPA also possesses peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase activity and is believed to play an important role in protein folding. 76 Although CyPA was initially described as a solely intracellular protein, later experiments have revealed it can be released by cells in response to inflammatory stimuli. 77, 78 Indeed, the presence of elevated levels of extracellular cyclophilins has been reported in several different inflammatory diseases, including severe sepsis, 79 vascular smooth muscle cell disease 80 and RA. 81 In the case of RA, levels of extracellular CyPA within synovial fluid of patients with ongoing disease were found to directly correlate with neutrophil numbers present in the same fluid, suggesting an association between cyclophilin levels and disease severity. 81 In a recent study, cartilage chondrocytes were shown to secrete cyclophilin B (CyPB) in response to matrix metalloproteinases, providing an additional source of extracellular cyclophilins released during ongoing RA. 82 One way in which these extracellular cyclophilins might contribute to inflammatory responses is via their chemotactic properties. 83 Several studies have demonstrated a chemotactic activity of extracellular CyPA and CyPB for neutrophils, eosinophils, and T lymphocytes 77,78,84 suggesting the presence of a cyclophilin receptor on target cells. A yeast two-hybrid screen with a B-cell cDNA library for cell-surface CyPA-binding molecules identified CD147 as a potential candidate, and subsequent analysis demonstrated that CD147 mediates the signalling and chemotactic activities of CyPA. 71 The signalling initiated by cyclophilin B also has been found to require CD147 85 suggesting that CD147 is the principal signalling receptor for extracellular cyclophilins.

Such a mode of signalling requires only a transient interaction between the ligand and the receptor and is consistent with low-affinity binding interaction between CD147 and CyPA. 71 While the chemotactic properties of cyclophilin-CD147 interactions have been well documented in vitro, little is known of the physiological and pathological relevance of such interactions in vivo. Recently, we reported that anti-CD147 antibodies, as well as non-immunosuppressive CsA analogue, SDZNIM811, significantly reduced the inflammatory response in a mouse model of acute lung inflammation that closely resembles acute lung injury in humans. 88 Strikingly, treatment of the lipopolysaccharidesensitized mice with anti-CD147 monoclonal antibody (mAb) or SDZNIM811 led to a 40-50% inhibition of the development of neutrophilia within lung tissues and airways. Importantly, treating mice with a combination of anti-CD147 and CsA led to an inhibition of neutrophil infiltration only slightly greater than that induced by the individual treatments, indicating that anti-CD147 and CsA are probably acting on the same cyclophilin-CD147 interactions. This result reduces the possibility that other activities of CD147, such as an adhesion molecule, 48 contribute to the observed effects of the anti-CD147 antibody on neutrophil recruitment.

In both cases, treatment of the cells with CsA reduced surface expression of the proteins without altering their total cellular levels, suggesting a block at the step of transition from the endoplasmic reticulum to the trans-Golgi network. The cyclophilin(s) involved in regulation of trafficking of these proteins and the cyclophilininteracting domains within these targets have not yet been identified. Analysis of CD147 cell-surface expression revealed its unexpected sensitivity to CsA, suggesting involvement of a cyclophilin in the regulation of CD147 intracellular trafficking. 97 Solution binding experiments demonstrated the role of CD147 transmembrane domain as a main binding site for CyPA and localized this interaction to a prolinecontaining peptide in the transmembrane domain. Mutation of this proline residue (Pro211) diminished transport of CD147 to the plasma membrane without reducing the total level of CD147 expression. 97 The cyclophilin involved in CD147 expression was recently identified as cyclophilin 60 (CyP60), a distinct member of the cyclophilin family of proteins. 98 CD147 coimmunoprecipitated with CyP60, and confocal immunofluorescent microscopy revealed intracellular colocalization of CyP60 and CD147 at the plasma membrane, consistent with CyP60 functioning as a chaperone for CD147. These results suggest that CyP60 plays an important role in the translocation of CD147 to the cell surface. Given that CyP60 interacts with Pro211 located at the interface of the membrane and extracellular domains of CD147. 97 CyP60 must localize to the lumen of the Golgi apparatus to get access to this site on CD147 (Fig. 1) . The more abundant CyPA is excluded from the Golgi lumen (Fig. 1) , explaining lack of intracellular interaction between CyPA and CD147. 98 It will be interesting to determine whether CyP60 interaction with CD147 also involves rotamase activity of CyP60, as has been shown for CyPA-CD147 interaction. 71 However, stability of this interaction illustrated by coimmunoprecipitation of CyP60 and CD147 98 suggests involvement of some type of stable non-covalent binding.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 432, "end": 434, "text": "90", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}, {"start": 571, "end": 573, "text": "91", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 650, "end": 652, "text": "92", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 749, "end": 752, "text": "93,", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 753, "end": 755, "text": "94", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 991, "end": 994, "text": "95,", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 995, "end": 997, "text": "96", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 1725, "end": 1727, "text": "97", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 2081, "end": 2083, "text": "97", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 2686, "end": 2688, "text": "97", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 2928, "end": 2930, "text": "98", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 3092, "end": 3094, "text": "71", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2781, "end": 2789, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2848, "end": 2856, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Regulation of the cell surface expression of CD147"}, {"text": "CD147 has been shown to interact with several other proteins that may influence its localization. For example, described previously interaction of CD147 with MCT1 and MCT4, the proton-coupled transporters of monocarboxylates, 23 occurs within the cellular membrane and critically depends on the centrally positioned glutamic acid residue 218 in the CD147 transmembrane domain. When association of CD147 with monocarboxylate transporter MCT1 was disrupted by mutating this glutamic acid, neither CD147 nor MCT1 reached the plasma membrane. 27 CD147 also interacts with caveolin-1 on a cell surface and this interaction seems to negatively regulate clustering and activity of CD147. 28 Association with caveolin-1 depends on the second immunoglobulin domain in the extracellular portion of CD147. Finally, leucine 252 (along with the adjacent amino acids 243, 244, 245 and 246) in the cytoplasmic domain of CD147 was identified as a basolateral signal targeting CD147 to the basolateral membrane in extraocular epithelia. Deletion of these amino acids leads to mistargeting of CD147 to the apical membranes. 99 This signal seems to function only in some cell types (e.g. it was not recognized in human retinal pigment epithelium cells 99 ), suggesting that it mediates interaction with some cell-specific regulator of protein trafficking. Future studies will hopefully integrate these findings into a unifying model of CD147 trafficking. Such model will not only suggest new targets for therapeutic interventions in diseases where CD147 is recognized as a pathogenetic factor (e.g. cancer or rheumatoid arthritis), but will also explain the role of CD147 in other biological processes, such as development of the eye or spermatogenesis. 100, 101 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 226, "end": 228, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start":
