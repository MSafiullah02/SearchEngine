Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a photocatalyst that is used to make an antimicrobial surface and has proved to be effective for sterilizing a wide range of microorganisms, including endospores (Foster et al., 2011). TiO2 does not produce byproducts, can be used repeatedly, and has the advantages of being stable and non-toxic under UV irradiation. (Yemmireddy and Hung, 2015). TiO2 has also been approved by the American Food and Drug Administration for use in human food, drugs, cosmetics, and food contact materials (Chawengkijwanich and Hayata, 2008). The mechanism of action of TiO2 is due to the production of reactive oxygen species(ROS) with strong oxidizing power when UV light is irradiated at wavelengths of less than 385 nm (Maness et al., 1999). When microorganisms are exposed to \u00b7O2 and \u00b7OH produced by photocatalyst, oxidative damage occurs in cell walls, cell membranes, DNA, and RNA (Blake et al., 1999). The oxidation of unsaturated phospholipids destroys the cell membrane, and the increase of ion permeability induces cell death by inducing oxidation of the internal cellular components (Alrousan et al., 2009).",

UV-C is a light with a wavelength of 200\u2013270 nm, which is readily absorbed by DNA, leading to the production of a large amount of pyrimidine dimers. The pyrimidine dimers formed by the absorption of UV-C into DNA kills cells by interfering with DNA transfer and replication, making UV-C effective in sterilizing microorganisms. (Chevremont et al., 2012). UV-C does not create chemical residues, has low cost maintenance, and does not change quality because it is dry and cold processes (Guerrero-Beltr\u00b7n and Barbosa-C\u00b7novas, 2004). UV-A has a wavelength of 320\u2013400 nm that induces the formation of active substances such as peroxide, which has a inactivation effect on the survival of microorganisms (Oppezzo and Pizarro, 2001). UV-A causes cell membrane damage due to long wavelengths, and shows lethal effects against microorganisms (Bintsis et al., 2000). Recent studies have shown that the antimicrobial effect of combined treatment with UV-C and UV-A is more effective than the effect of using UV-C or UV-A alone (Chevremont et al., 2012).",

However, Boer et al. found that black pepper showed a high level of microbial contamination above 107 CFU/g (De Boer et al., 1985). Black pepper is used as a spice to enhance taste and aroma in various dishes. Therefore, if spices such as black pepper are contaminated with bacterial pathogens, pathogens can easily enter food and cause food poisoning (McKee, 1995). Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli O157:H7 are the most frequently reported pathogens causing food poisoning and life-threatening diseases (Tarr, 1995; Zweifel and Stephan, 2012).",

The diluted sample suspension was plated on TSA, and the plate was cultured at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h. Then, 7\u20138 mL of XLD agar and SMac agar were poured on the plate (Kang and Siragusa, 1999). When the agar was hard, the plate was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24\u201348 h, and then and the colonies formed were counted. The colony number was calculated by Ukuku in terms of % population of injured cells via the following formula (Ukuku and Geveke, 2010):\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\left[ {1 - {\\text{colonies}}\\;{\\text{on}}\\;{\\text{selective}}\\;{\\text{agar/counts}}\\;{\\text{on}}\\;{\\text{agar}}\\;{\\text{in}}\\;{\\text{OV}}\\;{\\text{method}}} \\right] \\times 100$$\\end{document}1-coloniesonselectiveagar/countsonagarinOVmethod\u00d7100",
