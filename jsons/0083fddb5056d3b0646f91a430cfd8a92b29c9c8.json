Authorities also temporarily restricted public access to its two Holy mosques in Makkah and Medina. This welcomed decision by the Saudi Council of Senior Scholars would encourage other Muslim countries to take similar measures to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19. As the Holy month of Ramadan approaches, the General Secretariat of the Council of Senior Scholars of Saudi Arabia has also urged all Muslims to abide by preventive health measures when performing all acts of worship including performing obligatory prayers at home and avoiding gatherings. The WHO has also recently published its interim guidelines for safe Ramadan practices in the context of the COVID-19 as well as general recommendations for religious leaders and faith-based communities. We believe, for the time being, temporary closure of places of worship for group prayers and religious services should be implements by countries around the world (especially those with local COVID-19 transmission) regardless of faiths involved, with alternatives offered if possible, to help fight the pandemic. De-escalation of these measures later on in the life cycle of the pandemic will need to be based on thorough risk assessments and at first may involve intermediate measures, if these are possible. These may include moving services online or outdoors, restricting the number of attendees and/or excluding high-risk populations and limiting the duration of the religious gatherings and services as well as reducing the level of personal contact at these locations and events. However, for such measures to be effective and not be counterproductive, risk communication and educating the public regarding the reasoning behind and aims of such actions are crucial. The latter should be done through both official authorities as well as religious and community leaders and organisations, as to avoid resentment and rebellion against these measures and prevent religious gatherings moving from the official places of worship to makeshift indoor or outdoor locations that could present a similar or greater risk for COVID-19 transmission.",
