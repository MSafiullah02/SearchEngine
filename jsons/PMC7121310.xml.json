Although technical issues such as ease of performance, reproducibility, sensitivity, and specificity of molecular tests are important, cost and potential contribution to patient care are also of concern. Molecular methods may be an improvement over conventional microbiologic testing in many ways. Currently, their most practical and useful application is in detecting and identifying infectious agents for which routine growth-based culture and microscopy methods may not be adequate.",

Because the target DNA or RNA may be present in very small amounts in clinical specimens, various signal amplification and target amplification techniques have been used to detect infectious agents in clinical diagnostic laboratories (Vaneechoutte and Van Eldere 1997). Although mainly a research tool, nucleic acid sequence analysis coupled with target amplification is clinically useful and helps to detect and identify previously uncultivable organisms and characterize antimicrobial resistance gene mutations, thus aiding both diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases. Automation and high-density oligonucleotide probe arrays (DNA chips) also hold great promise for characterizing microbial pathogens.",

Amplification of the detection signal after probe hybridization improves sensitivity to as low as 500 gene copies per microliter and provides quantitative capabilities.

Likewise, they are useful in detecting resistance in viruses, slow-growing or nonviable organisms, or organisms with resistance mechanisms that are not reliably detected by phenotypic methods. However, because of their high specificity, molecular methods will not detect newly emerging resistance mechanisms and are unlikely to be useful in detecting resistance genes in species where the gene has not been observed previously. Furthermore, the presence of a resistance gene does not mean that the gene will be expressed, and the absence of a known resistance gene does not exclude the possibility of resistance from another mechanism.

The use of sensitive and specific laboratory methods for diagnosing this condition is crucial to reduce the transmission and sequelae of STI. Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis are the pathogens most frequently involved in urethral and cervical infection. Culture continues to be the gold standard for diagnosing gonorrhea. Nucleic acid amplification assays are considered the new gold standard for C. trachomatis, although culture is till the most specific technique. Genital ulcers due to Treponema pallidum, Haemophilus ducreyi, or herpes simplex virus have little clinical and bacteriological correlation; therefore, it is essential to establish the microbiological diagnosis. Lesions present in the primary or secondary period of syphilis can be diagnosed by dark field microscopy. Serologic diagnosis for the remaining periods is based on non-treponemal tests associated with confirmatory treponemal tests. Cell culture is considered the gold standard for herpes simplex virus although molecular methods also have a sensitivity and specificity near 100%. Currently, microbiologic diagnosis of H. ducreyi and venereal lymphogranuloma is achieved with the use of molecular methods on samples obtained from the ulceration or lymph adenopathy. The diagnosis of genital warts in immunocompetent patients is based on clinical findings in most cases because the lesions are sufficiently characteristic.

The rapid, nonculture techniques for direct detection of Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and herpes simplex virus are reviewed, and their advantages and disadvantages are compared with conventional diagnostic methods (Woods, 1995\n). Polymerase chain reaction tests were performed on specimens from consecutive male patients with genital ulcers to detect sexually transmitted pathogens. PCR was also performed for the detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Trichomonas vaginalis on urethral specimens from consecutive subjects with dysuria or urethral discharge. Antibody tests for syphilis and Herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2) and human immunodeficiency virus antibodies were performed. Men at risk of genital ulcers should be asked about relevant symptoms with and without prompting and examined clinically to maximize the likelihood of correct diagnosis and treatment. The finding of a high prevalence of HSV-2 and associated dysuria cautions against providing empirical treatment for gonorrhoea and chlamydia in ulcer patients with dysuria but without urethral discharge. Innovative strategies to limit the burden of HSV-2 infection in this population are required (O\u2019Farrell et al., 2008).",

With the advent of molecular technologies, including target and signal amplification methods, diagnoses of STIs have been revolutionised and allow the use of non or minimally invasive sampling techniques, some of which are self-collected by the patient, e.g. first-void urine, cervico-vaginal lavage, low vaginal swabs, and tampons. Most studies evaluating such self-sampling with molecular diagnostic techniques have demonstrated an equivalent or superior detection of STIs as compared to conventional sampling and detection methods. These sampling methods can also be used to determine prevalence of STIs in various populations, but particularly those with difficult access to medical care (Garland and Tabrizi, 2004).",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recommended confirmation of positive NAAT results in low-prevalence populations. APTIMA CT (ACT) and APTIMA GC (AGC) are two discrete NAATs for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae detection that are suitable for confirming AC2-positive results because they target different nucleic acid sequences. Thus, ACT and AGC relative sensitivity compared to that of AC2 was 100%. All APTIMA assays detected more confirmed positive results than culture, DFA, and LCx. The performance of APTIMA assays was not altered by the use of various swab types and by long-term storage of specimens. All APTIMA assays are highly sensitive and rapid. ACT and AGC can be recommended for confirmation of positive results from other NAATs, such as AC2 and LCx (Boyadzhyan et al., 2004).",

Cell culture techniques are insensitive due to the low viral burden typically found associated with encephalitis and perhaps also the presence of host neutralizing antibodies. CSF culture for HSV detects less than 2% of clinically determined adult HSV encephalitis cases and 40% of neonatal central nervous system (CNS) disease. In contrast, HSV NAA is positive in most adult cases resulting in sensitivity and specificity > 95% and is 75% sensitive and 100% specific for neonatal meningitis. The rapid diagnosis of HSV encephalitis can prevent a brain biopsy and rapidly determine the need for acyclovir therapy. Enterovirus is the most common cause of aseptic meningitis in the summer and fall months in temperate climates and accounts for 10\u201320% of encephalitis cases. Nucleic acid amplification has also been successfully applied to other etiologies of viral CNS disease, such as CMV and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), but these assays have not been implemented as broadly as those for HSV and EV, so are still transitioning to becoming the method of choice. It should be noted that not all encephalitis viruses are readily detected by NAA. For example, due to the short period of viremia in many carboviral infections (i.e., West Nile Virus), CSF NAA has low sensitivity, and the gold standard remains serology. CSF NAA false negative results can occur due to collection of CSF very early or very late in illness, rapid viral clearance in immunocompetent hosts, and NAA inhibitors. False positive CSF NAA results also occur primarily due to lack of data to suggest the detection of certain viral nucleic acids correlates with clinical CNS disease, but can also be caused by the presence of peripheral blood in the CSF. While CSF NAA is considered by many the diagnostic standard of care as discussed above, the lack of standardized FDA-approved assays has made implementation of CSF NAA difficult in nonacademic settings. While most laboratories offering CSF NAA use qualitative methods, data indicate a role for quantitative CSF NAA in differentiating nonspecific presence of virus and virus-associated disease, to aid in prognosis for improved patient management, and in monitoring antiviral therapy.",

It should be noted that NAA of MTB does not replace the need for routine mycobacterial culture and susceptibility testing. In addition to the direct detection of MTB, techniques such as probe-based technology and sequence analysis can be applied to cultured isolates to decrease the time to identification over routine biochemical analysis. Rapid identification of MTB impacts not only patient care, but also infection control. Due to the increasing frequency of isolation of mycobacterial species associated with immunocompromised hosts and the increased incidence of multi-drug resistant MTB, it has become imperative to offer accurate yet rapid diagnostic tools for the detection and identification of mycobacteria (Tiwari et al., 2007). A debate exists regarding the gold standard for the laboratory diagnosis of Bordetella pertussis. Historically, culture plates collected at the patient\u2019s bedside (i.e., cough plates) have been considered the reference method. Although culture is very specific, its sensitivity suffers partially due to the organism\u2019s fastidious nature, but primarily because the highest sensitivity for culture occurs before patients are symptomatic. NAA remains positive for longer after therapy than culture, and NAA is also positive for a longer period after onset of symptoms. Therefore, NAA is useful for patients presenting later in their illness. NAA testing allows for same-day results and since erythromycin-resistant B. pertussis is still rare, a cultured isolate is rarely needed for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Multiple studies have demonstrated significant increased detection of B. pertussis when comparing NAA to culture: reported PCR-positive, culture-negative samples range from 13 to 88%. However, due to potential false positive and false negative results with B. pertussis NAA procedures, it is strongly recommended that results be considered in the context of patient clinical presentation, and clinically inconsistent results should be confirmed by a second method.",

Since antimicrobial resistance can be multi-factorial, this practice is limited to organisms in which the results can be interpreted with confidence in regard to the genotypic relationship to clinical treatment and/or infection control precautions. Such examples are direct detection of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) from rectal and nares surveillance cultures, respectively. Screening patients for VRE and MRSA carriage is a key strategy for preventing the spread of these organisms in health care settings. NAA technology reportedly increases VRE detection by up to 120%. In addition, enterococci that confer low-level intrinsic resistance, and thus not considered \u201ctrue\u201d VRE, are accurately ruled out preventing unnecessary contact precautions and contributing to hospital savings. NAA detection of MRSA has been shown to be equal in sensitivity to culture-based methods, but has the advantage of offering a faster turnaround time, thus impacting hospital cost savings. However, it should be noted that direct specimen testing for MRSA comes with limitations, often including a lower positive predictive value than conventional methods. More recently, new strains of MRSA have appeared that are associated with skin and soft tissue infections in outpatients and are called community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA). The increasing incidence of CA-MRSA is causing overall rates of MRSA to rise. Therefore, it has become even more important to quickly and accurately identify resistant isolates.",

Several different epidemiologic typing methods have been applied in studies of microbial pathogens (Table 19.4). The phenotypic methods have occasionally been useful in describing the epidemiology of infectious diseases; however, they are too variable, slow, and labor-intensive to be of much use in most epidemiologic investigations. Newer DNA-based typing methods have eliminated most of these limitations and are now the preferred techniques for epidemiologic typing. The most widely used molecular typing methods include plasmid profiling, restriction endonuclease analysis of plasmid and genomic DNA, Southern hybridization analysis using specific DNA probes, and chromosomal DNA profiling using either pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) or PCR-based methods. All these methods use electric fields to separate DNA fragments, whole chromosomes, or plasmids into unique patterns or fingerprints that are visualized by staining with ethidium bromide or by nucleic acid probe hybridization. Molecular typing is performed to determine whether different isolates give the same or different results for one or more tests. Epidemiologically related isolates share the same DNA profile or fingerprint, whereas sporadic or epidemiologically unrelated isolates have distinctly different patterns. If isolates from different patients share the same fingerprint, they probably originated from the same clone and were transmitted from patient to patient by a common source or mechanism.\n",

The implementation of user-defined NAA testing has revolutionized clinical molecular infectious disease testing. In addition, commercially-available non-FDA-approved NAA assays are increasingly becoming available as analyte specific reagents (ASRs). Though all reagents necessary for the amplification reaction can be purchased commercially, assay development and verification studies must be performed by individual laboratories. In many cases, there are no comparative studies between user-defined NAA procedures, including ASRs, limiting the comparative value of assays between institutions (particularly in viral load monitoring) and restricting the application of such procedures to more experienced laboratories. It is not without considerable cost that a molecular infectious disease diagnostic lab is developed. It represents an institutional commitment because the costs may only be offset when analysis of hospital-wide cost savings is employed (i.e. shorter hospital stays, decreased use of unncecessary antibiotics). The costs incurred not only stem from instrumentation purchases, but also from the dedicated, expert staff required for such testing. Since many academic medical centers have resorted to implementing user-defined assays, verification and validation studies are substantial and require extensive resources, including time, staff, and expertise. These studies are crucial to defining the performance of the assay and determining appropriate clinical utilization.
