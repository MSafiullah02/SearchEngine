ORF2 encodes a 660 amino acid-long capsid protein that self-assembles into virus-like particles (VLPs) when expressed in mammalian, insect, or bacterial cells.3 Like the feco-orally transmitted virus, VLPs exhibit great stability in the harsh environment of the gut. This and various other properties of these VLPs make them very attractive tools for developing orally deliverable nanoparticles carrying foreign epitopes, heterologous DNA, and small molecules.

It is interesting that a nonenveloped RNA virus shows such high stability to extreme pH, bile, and blood before undergoing specific receptor engagement, entry, and replication in liver cells.

Further, a potential packaging signal was identified using a yeast three-hybrid approach toward the 5\u2019 end of the genome within the ORF1 gene.54 The implications of this translocation are not clear, although it may have a role in virus assembly.",

There are many examples of successful live, attenuated vaccines.57 The oral polio vaccine (OPV), for example, has been highly effective in eradicating polio from most parts of the world.58 Since poliovirus transmits feco-orally, a vaccinated person is able to evade infection due to high levels of secreted IgA antibody that prevent the virus from crossing the intestinal barrier and into the blood. A major concern with such vaccines is, however, the risk of reversion to wild-type, replication-competent virus. Other concerns like the integration of viral genome into the host genome can consequently disrupt the host gene in the cell life cycles. This has largely been overcome by the use of VLPs. The native configuration of the viral capsid and/or envelope proteins is maintained when expressed using yeast, bacterial, insect, or mammalian expression systems. The self-assembly of the viral structural proteins displays the immunological epitopes in a way that would resemble the proper conformations of viruses without the risk of infection by voiding the viral nucleic acid completely for replication. VLP-based vaccine formulations are unique because they can be modified to change the epitopes on the exposed surface and thus be used as a platform for presenting immunogens from heterologous sources and other pathogens. Several VLP-based vaccines are in clinical trials or are already commercially available (Table 16.1\n).59., 60. There have been several recent advances in the development of mucosally deliverable vaccine formulations. While many of these use various natural and synthetic polymers,61., 62. there are several that make use of VLPs based on naturally pathogenic viruses (Table 16.1).",

However, chimerization of the P domain with the arginine-rich p18 peptide increases susceptibility to action by intestinal proteases. This could be a major pitfall in the context of using the VLPs as nanocarriers or vaccines. Interestingly, we found that p18 VLPs remained intact when treated with trypsin and pepsin and observed by electron microscopy (Fig. 16.7\nA). Proteolytic cleavage did take place, likely at the end of the C terminal end of the P18 insertion, and this was evidenced by the 42 kDa band observed on trypsin treatment by SDS-PAGE that was reactive to HIV antibodies (Fig. 16.7B). Trypsin treatment did not cause surface spikes to be dissociated form the VLP, and this is due to the hydrophobic interactions that hold the quaternary structure of the VLP together and also stabilize the dimeric interactions of two P domains in the same spike. Even after trypsin cleavage, the hydrophobic residues in the A beta strand of the P domain form a strong interaction with the C terminal region, thereby maintaining the integrity of VLP structure (Fig. 16.7C).",

Insertion of a foreign epitope at this residue disrupts the conformational epitope bound by HEP224 without altering VLP properties and antigenicity of the foreign epitope (Fig. 16.8\nA, B).78 This eliminates the issue of self-immunity that arises with many other mucosal VLP systems, such as the polyoma virus.82\n",

            "text": "The insect cell culture\u2013based protein expression system is inexpensive and easy to scale up. Being eukaryotic, insect cells allow correct folding and posttranslation modification, and purified protein can be used therapeutically. A high degree of purity is achievable with an easy purification process, particularly when recombinant protein is secreted into the cell culture medium. HEV capsid protein PORF2, when expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) or Trichoplusia ni (Tn5) insect cells, self-assembles into VLPs and is secreted into the culture medium. Further, being natural human pathogens, viruses have evolved such that their capsid proteins are recognized by the immune system and internalized by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), processed and presented in the context of major histocompatibility (MHC) molecules. Viral antigens are exposed to CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes to generate primary and memory responses. This feature allows chimeric HEV VLP\u2013based vaccines to be administered without the need for an external adjuvant for enhancing the immune response. Most artificial adjuvants, such as alum, have various side effects related to irregular translocation to nonspecific sites and are unsuitable for use with specific vaccine antigens, such as those requiring a Th1 response.83 VLPs, on the other hand, are easily encountered by the innate immune system, which in turn primes the adaptive immune system to generate a specific and strong response against the chimerized antigen or DNA vaccine. Thus, the chimerized HEV VLP is uniquely positioned in terms of its ability not only to express correctly folded foreign antigens but also to carry heterologous DNA to be used as a DNA vaccine. This has been summarized in Fig. 16.10\n.",

Many cytoplasmically replicating RNA viruses enter cells by endocytosis and then are released from the endosomal system into the cytosplasm, from where they travel to their site of replication by exploiting the cytoskeletal system. In liver cells, HEV enters via endocytosis into early endosomes and uses clathrin, dynamin-2, membrane cholesterol, and the microtubular network to facilitate successful infection.49 Further, escape from endosomes is not triggered by lowered endosomal pH, and further exploration into the mechanism of endosomal escape has to be carried out. This is particularly relevant in the context of HEV VLP for DNA delivery because the ultimate goal is the use of these orally active VLPs of gene therapy. As a proof-of-concept, we have already seen that HEV VLPs carrying DNA vaccines are successful in gaining exposure and access to the immune system and subsequently generating an immune response.",
