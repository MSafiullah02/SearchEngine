Further, viral infections in the central nervous system (CNS) are hypothesized to indirectly contribute to neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases later in life due to damage from a previous infection (e.g. schizophrenia, Parkinson's Disease) (Jang et al., 2009, Khandaker et al., 2013, Landreau et al., 2012). While it is clear that many neurotropic viruses are capable of causing significant disease in the neonatal brain, the functionality of the anti-viral immune response and how it contributes to neuropathology in neonates is poorly defined.",

In the brain, a non-cytolytic approach to viral clearance could be favorable for infected neurons, as these cells are largely non-renewable. Lytic approaches to viral clearance, such as through granzymes and perforins, carry the risk of irreversible damage and cell death to the infected neurons, which could contribute to long-term neurological deficits. In many adult models of CNS infection, the pleiotropic cytokine interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) is key to suppressing viral spread while sparing the infected neurons through non-cytolytic clearance, thus limiting neuropathology and viral replication (Burdeinick-Kerr et al., 2007, Hausmann et al., 2005, Larena et al., 2013, Patterson et al., 2002, Stubblefield Park et al., 2011). However, in neonates, viruses often spread rapidly in brain tissue despite the initiation of an immune response (Hausmann et al., 2005, Kopp et al., 2014, Manchester et al., 1999). This demonstrates the importance of better defining neonatal immune responses within the CNS.",

Depending upon the type and dose of antigen, neonatal T cells often skew toward a Th2-like response (including production of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) as opposed to a Th1 response, characterized by the production of IFN\u03b3 and TNF (Zaghouani et al., 2009). During a CNS infection, one could hypothesize that a Th1 response would be preferred in order to ensure adequate IFN\u03b3 expression and control viral replication in developing neurons while minimizing neuronal loss. However, IFN\u03b3 also has been shown to play both neurotoxic and neuroprotective roles for developing neurons, making the influence of IFN\u03b3 in controlling neonatal infections in the brain less clear (Mizuno et al., 2008, O'Donnell et al., 2015).",

To accomplish this, we used the transgenic CD46+ mouse, which expresses the human isoform of the measles virus (MV) receptor CD46 under the control of the neuron-specific enolase (NSE) promoter (Rall et al., 1997). Thus, human CD46 expression and viral infection are restricted to mature CNS neurons. We evaluated adult and neonatal CD46+ mice lacking IFN\u03b3 or lacking adaptive immune cells for the development of an anti-viral immune response against MV-infected neurons in the brain. We show that IFN\u03b3 delays mortality and limits immune cell infiltration into the CNS of neonatal mice, but is insufficient to control viral spread or prevent mortality, despite an associated Th1-like cytokine profile in the brain.",

Immunocompetent CD46+ adult mice initiate a protective adaptive immune response with infiltration of CD4 and CD8 T cells as early as 3 days post-infection (dpi), with peak T cell infiltration between 7 and 14 dpi. MV infection is resolved typically by 30 dpi without any symptoms or signs of illness (Patterson et al., 2002). Both T cells and IFN\u03b3 are critical to the survival of adult CD46+ mice. CD46+ adult mice lacking mature T and B cells (CD46+/RAG2-KO) experience 100% mortality during infection, whereas CD46+ adult mice lacking only B cells do not succumb to the infection (Solomos et al., 2016). CD46+ adult mice that lack IFN\u03b3 (CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO) do not clear the virus, with ~50% of the mice succumbing to the infection within 21 dpi (O'Donnell et al., 2012). In order to study the outcome of infection in neonates, 2-day old CD46+ mice were infected with MV and monitored for signs of illness and mortality over a similar time frame (Fig. 1A). As a control for the injection procedure, CD46+ neonates were injected with 10 \u03bcl of PBS intracerebrally and did not show signs of illness and over the course of the experiment. MV-infected CD46+ neonates succumbed to the virus by 16 dpi, with 50% mortality by 8 dpi. During the infection, MV-infected neonates showed signs of illness including dehydration, lethargy, and tremors starting at 6dpi, with seizure activity before death.",

To determine if IFN\u03b3 contributed to the outcome of infection in neonates, CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO pups were infected with MV and observed for signs of illness (Fig. 1A). MV-infected CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO pups succumb to the infection earlier than CD46+ pups, reaching 100% mortality by 10 dpi. We also investigated the role of the adaptive immune system in neonates using recombinase activating gene 2 knockout mice (CD46+/RAG2-KO). We observed that CD46+/RAG2-KO neonates survive longer than CD46+ and CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO neonates. At 35 dpi, 20% of CD46+/RAG2-KO neonates had survived the infection with less signs of illness than the other CD46+ genotypes. These observations suggest that the adaptive immune response may play a detrimental role during neonatal infection, in contrast to the protective role that it plays in the adult brain. Furthermore, these findings demonstrate that IFN\u03b3 delays the pathogenic outcomes of infection, but is insufficient to protect the CD46+ neonates from death.",

To determine if survival correlates with the viral load in the brain, expression of measles virus nucleocapsid (N) RNA was determined in brain tissue using qRT-PCR (Fig. 1B and C). We focused on 4 and 6 days post-infection, as these time points correspond with early T cell infiltration (4 dpi) and with more extensive T cell infiltration (6 dpi). Regardless of immune background, MV RNA increased in all neonates over time, although this increase was only significant in CD46+ pups (p < 0.001). Unexpectedly, CD46+ neonates had a higher viral load compared to CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO (p < 0.05) and CD46+/RAG2-KO neonates at 6 dpi (p < 0.001, Fig. 1B). Thus, the level of viral RNA did not correlate with survival in the CD46+ neonates (Fig. 1A). This result suggests that the virus may not be directly causing death in neonates, but rather the nature of the host immune response may be a better predictor of survival. Regardless of genotype, levels of MV N-transcripts were higher in neonates than in adults (Fig. 1C), which may reflect both a more successful anti-viral response in adults and/or the ability of the virus to readily spread in young neurons.",

            "text": "MV-infected neonates develop neurological symptoms, including ataxia and seizures, as well as signs of wasting and dehydration. In ~8% of CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO neonates, enlarged heads and skulls were observed at the later stages post-infection (8\u201310 dpi). Upon dissection, edema was observed in the intracranial space, with fluid accumulation in the brain and reduced brain size. In contrast, CD46+ neonates did not demonstrate overt changes in head size during the infection. Thus, we determined if the loss of body weight correlated with changes in brain weight during infection (Fig. 2\n). At the initial stages of infection (2 dpi), there is no difference in the body or brain weight of MV-infected CD46+ (Fig. 2A and C) or CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO (Fig. 2B and D) neonates compared to uninfected controls. As the infection progresses, CD46+ neonates lose body weight at 4 dpi (11.7% loss compared to uninfected controls) followed by a transient increase in body (13.5%) and brain weight (6.2%; p < 0.05) at 6 dpi. MV-infected CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO neonates also show an increase in brain weight at 6 dpi (13%), but there is no difference in body weights compared to control. At 10 dpi, MV-infected CD46+ (loss of 10.3% brain weight; 21% body weight) and CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO (loss of 14.3% brain weight; 29% body weight) neonates show a significant decrease in brain and body weight compared to age-matched controls. Thus, MV-infected pups showed limited growth at the end stages of infection (10 dpi), when neurological symptoms are also the most severe. The finding that brain weights increased at 6 dpi, regardless of IFN\u03b3 expression, was surprising, as neurological symptoms are apparent at this time point. However, one possibility is that the temporary increase in brain weight could be due to edema or increased fluid retention in the tissue at that stage of infection, as the brains were not dried to eliminate water weight before measurement. Regardless of the increase in weight at 6 dpi, the loss of brain and body weights occurred independently of IFN\u03b3, even when edema was not present. The ratios of brain weight/body weight were similar for both CD46+ and CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO neonates regardless of infection (0.07 for both genotypes) at 6 dpi. However, at 10 dpi, the ratio increases in CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO neonates (0.1 in infected pups versus 0.05 for uninfected pups), but remains similar in CD46+ neonates (0.06 in infected and uninfected pups). Despite the reduction in brain weights in the absence of IFN\u03b3, there is also a greater reduction in body weights at 10 dpi (Fig. 2D), which is indicative of the severity of wasting in the CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO pups.",

During brain insults, circulating monocytes migrate to the breached blood brain barrier and enter the brain. Thus, both the infiltrating monocytes and microglia contribute to the neuroimmune response in the brain. We hypothesized that pups lacking IFN\u03b3 would show limited microglial/macrophage induction during infection. Microglia were identified by CD45intermediate/CD11b+ staining and macrophages by CD45high/CD11b+ in the brain by flow cytometry (Greter et al., 2015). In CD46+ neonates, we observed that there is no change in the number of microglia from 4 to 6 dpi (Fig. 3A). In CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO and CD46+/RAG2-KO neonatal brains, there is a significant increase in microglial numbers from 4 to 6 dpi (p < 0.001). When compared across the genotypes, we observe that CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO neonates have the highest number of microglia at 6 dpi compared to CD46+ (p < 0.001) and CD46+/RAG2-KO neonates (p < 0.05). Similar to microglia numbers, neonates without IFN\u03b3 showed the highest infiltration of macrophages at 6 dpi (Fig. 3B). From 4 to 6 dpi, there is a significant influx of macrophages in CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO neonates post-infection, whereas CD46+/RAG2-KO neonates showed no change in macrophage numbers as the infection progressed. These findings suggest IFN\u03b3 may confer an anti-inflammatory effect in the neonatal CNS, as the numbers of macrophages/microglia were elevated in the absence of IFN\u03b3.",

Sagittal brain sections were immunostained for microglia/macrophages using Iba1 (green), which is a marker that shows increased expression in activated cells (Sasaki et al., 2001), and for measles virus antigen using antibodies against the matrix and hemagglutinin protein (red, Fig. 3). In CD46+ (Fig. 3C) and CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO brains (Fig. 3D), activated microglia/macrophages were observed with bright Iba1 staining in the brain parenchyma in comparison to uninfected controls. MV antigen was observed in the prefrontal cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum at 7 dpi regardless of IFN\u03b3 expression. At the later stages of infection (10 dpi), there is widespread MV infection throughout the CNS, including involvement of the hippocampus, which is also highly infected in adults (data not shown). Microglia/macrophages with bright Iba1 staining were consistently observed in close proximity to MV-infected neurons. In brain regions with MV+ cells, Iba1+ cells showed ameboid morphology with rounder cell bodies and retracted processes in both CD46+ and CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO pups. Iba1+ cells in uninfected brains show thin, ramified processes and with less intense Iba1 staining (Fig. 3C and D, top rows) in comparison to MV-infected brains. Thus, changes in microglia/macrophage morphology are observed in the absence of IFN\u03b3, suggesting that other cytokines/chemokines can trigger activation during infection.",

Since NK cells can be major producers of IFN\u03b3, we investigated whether NK cells infiltrate into the brain parenchyma in neonates. As NK cells are part of the innate immune response, we quantified the early stages of infection (2 and 4 dpi) as well as a time point where T cell infiltration was increasing (6 dpi) (Fig. 4\n). At 2 and 4 dpi, there is no significant difference in MV-infected pups compared to uninfected controls regardless of IFN\u03b3 expression. At 6 dpi, there is a significant increase in total NK cell number (NK1.1+, CD49b+, and NK1.1+/CD49b+) in MV-infected neonates compared to uninfected controls in both CD46+ (Fig. 4A, p < 0.05) and CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO (Fig. 4B, p < 0.001) genotypes. Collectively, this data show that NK cells arrive in the CNS during infection independently of IFN\u03b3.",

Neutrophils are recruited early in viral infections, and can contribute to tissue damage through protease and oxidase release during viral clearance (Drescher and Bai, 2013). Neutrophils are also capable of producing IFN\u03b3 in response to various pathogens (Sturge et al., 2013). In neonates that lack IFN\u03b3, neutrophil (CD45hi, CD11b+, and Ly6G+) infiltration is significantly higher compared to CD46+ neonates at 4 and 6 dpi (Fig. 4C). CD46+/RAG2-KO neonates also show progressively elevated levels of neutrophils in the CNS, but it is not significantly different from CD46+ or CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO neonates at either time point. This suggests that IFN\u03b3 may downregulate neutrophil recruitment in the CD46+ neonates during infection, and that excessive neutrophil infiltration may correlate with earlier death in CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO neonates.",

Furthermore, T cell infiltration correlates with IFN\u03b3 expression in the CD46+ adult brains (O'Donnell et al., 2012). Thus, we investigated the infiltration of T cells in neonatal brains after MV infection. Using flow cytometry of whole brain homogenates, the numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells in the neonatal brain were quantified at 4, 7, and 10 dpi, which corresponds to time points where T cells are first observed by immunohistochemistry (4 dpi) and time points that parallel peak infiltration of T cells in adults (7 and 10 dpi). At 4 dpi, there is no difference in the number of CD4 or CD8 T cells in the infected CD46+ neonates compared to uninfected controls (Fig. 5A and B). There is higher infiltration of CD4 T cells in the absence of IFN\u03b3 early in infection at 4 dpi (Fig. 5A). Similarly, at 7 dpi, significant CD4 T cell infiltration was observed only in the absence of IFN\u03b3 (Fig. 5C), whereas CD8 T cell infiltration was induced in MV-infected neonates regardless of IFN\u03b3 expression (Fig. 5D). At later stages of infection (10 dpi), significant infiltration of CD4 (Fig. 5E) and CD8 T cells (Fig. 5F) was observed only in the CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO pups in comparison to uninfected controls. CD46+ pups did not show a significant increase in CD4 or CD8 T cells at 10 dpi, although a trend toward increasing CD8 T cell number was observed (p = 0.082). Comparing across genotypes, CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO neonates have significantly higher infiltration of CD4 T cells (p < 0.001) and CD8 T cells (p < 0.05) compared to CD46+ neonates at 10 dpi. Thus, these results suggest that IFN\u03b3 may have a suppressive/anti-inflammatory effect on T-cell infiltration at later time points in infection.",

However, in the CD46+ genotype, there is no difference in the number of CD8+ T cells between adults and neonates. Additionally, in contrast to the neonates, there is no difference in the T cell numbers between CD46+ and CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO adults. We also compared the CD4:CD8 T cell ratio in adults and neonates. CD46+ adults (5.9), CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO adults (2.6), and CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO neonates (2.9) were skewed toward CD4 T cells. Whereas CD46+ neonates (0.5) have a ratio that is skewed toward CD8 T-cells. Of note, only CD46+ adult mice can control MV in the CNS (O'Donnell et al., 2012).

Recognition of viral RNA by PRRs such as the cytoplasmic retinoic acid-induced gene-I (RIGI) and the membrane bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs) lead to the induction of Type 1 IFNs, which are significant early steps in viral control (Akira et al., 2006, Yoneyama et al., 2004, Zalinger et al., 2015). For our analysis, we focused on RIGI, which is expressed in the brains of MV-infected transgenic mice expressing Hsp70, and TLR 3 and 7, which recognize viral RNAs (Kim et al., 2013, Sorgeloos et al., 2013). TLR3, in particular, has been shown to be induced by the MV-Edmonston strain in cell lines (Tanabe et al., 2003). During infection of CD46+ mice, both CD46+ and CD46+/RAG2-KO neonates upregulate RIGI mRNA (12.2-fold and 24.4-fold respectively, Fig. 7A) in the brain, whereas infected CD46+ adults did not demonstrate significant upregulation of RIGI mRNA with infection (Fig. 7B). CD46+ MV-infected neonates show significantly higher expression of RIGI mRNA compared to CD46+ adults (Fig. 7B). CD46+ neonates did not upregulate either TLR3 or TLR7 mRNA (Fig. 7E and I), while CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO neonates upregulated TLR3 mRNA (41-fold; Fig. 7E) and CD46+/RAG2-KOs upregulated TLR7 mRNA (11-fold; Fig. 7I). In contrast, CD46+ adults upregulate TLR3 mRNA (2.3 \u00d7 105-fold) and TLR7 mRNA (37.3-fold) to a greater extent than the any genotype of the MV-infected neonates (Fig. 7F and J). These results suggest that the CD46+ adult mice may rely on the TLR family of proteins for recognition of the virus.",

In accordance with the whole brain mRNA, RIGI protein was upregulated with infection in both the hippocampus and cerebellum of infected neonates (22-fold and 15.6-fold versus infected CD46+ adults respectively, Fig. 7C and D). In contrast with the whole brain mRNA findings, TLR3 protein was not significantly upregulated by adults or neonates in either brain region (Fig. 7G and H). Additionally, TLR7 protein was upregulated only in the infected CD46+ neonatal cerebellum (6.3-fold) versus uninfected controls (Fig. 7L) and not in the hippocampus (Fig. 7K). These findings suggest that changes in whole brain mRNA do not necessarily correlate with protein expression in brain regions that carry a high viral load, particularly in adult CD46+ mice, which experience restricted \u201chot spots\u201d of viral replication in the brain. Moreover, these results imply that neonates, but not adults, induce RIGI expression in the brain tissue during infections.",

Gene expression of the PRRs is further enhanced by elevated IFN expression, allowing for a greater detection of invading pathogens (Schneider et al., 2014). Given the differential expression of PRRs observed in the CD46+ mice, we reasoned that there may be age-dependent differences in the expression of the Type 1 IFNs. Early in infection (3 dpi), we did not observe significant expression of IFN\u03b14 or IFN\u03b2 in the adults or neonates of any CD46+ genotype (Fig. 8\n). As the infection progressed (7 dpi), CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO neonates upregulated IFN\u03b14 (29-fold) to a greater extent in comparison to CD46+ (7.5-fold) and CD46+/RAG2-KO (5.7-fold) neonates post-infection, whereas CD46+ adults did not increase the expression of IFN\u03b14 significantly (Fig. 8A, B). In contrast, CD46+/RAG2-KO neonates demonstrated greater upregulation of IFN\u03b2 in comparison to other neonates (1644.8-fold; Fig. 8C). Although IFN\u03b2 also was upregulated in the CD46+ neonates (122-fold) at 7 dpi, CD46+ adults did not show significant upregulation of IFN\u03b2 at either time point (Fig. 8D). We also analyzed levels of the IFN-responsive gene (ISG), Melanoma Differentiation-Associated protein 5 (MDA5), which is a PRR, as a surrogate for Type I IFN signaling. MDA5 was not induced significantly in infected CD46+ neonates or adults at either time point. At 7 dpi, only the CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO neonates significantly upregulated MDA5, which may correlate with the elevated IFN\u03b14 observed at this time point. Although it is possible that other IFN\u03b1 isoforms are expressed in the infected adults, these results suggest that gene expression of Type I IFN and associated ISGs remain relatively low at the start of infection in both neonates and adults, when Type I IFN expression would be expected to dominate. Thus, we propose that the less effective immune response in neonates is not attributable to a diminished Type I IFN response.",

We hypothesized that neonates may express a Th2-biased cytokine response in the CNS, as has been noted in many peripheral infections (Lambert et al., 2014) and could contribute to ineffective viral clearance. To address this question, we examined the mRNA expression of 84 cytokine and chemokines genes in the MV-infected adult and neonatal brains using a qRT-PCR array. Table 1\nlists genes that were significantly upregulated by \u22652 fold in the MV-infected neonates and adults compared to age-matched, uninfected controls. Classical Th2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 were not upregulated in either MV-infected neonates or adults. Rather, many Th1-associated cytokines were expressed in comparison to uninfected controls at both ages (p < 0.05; Table 1, top panel). Among the Th1-associated factors, IFN\u03b3 (11-fold in neonates, 8-fold in adults), IL-1\u03b2 (3-fold in adults and neonates) and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 (Cxcl10; 85-fold in neonates, 44-fold in adults) were upregulated during MV infection at both ages. The anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL1rn) is also upregulated in both neonates (17.84-fold) and adults (14.4-fold) post-infection, as well as the expression of several other chemokines genes (Ccl12, Ccl3, Ccl4, Ccl5, Cxcl11 and Cxcl13). These findings suggest that the expression of many inflammatory genes is age-independent in the brain.",

The expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is significantly increased in MV-infected neonates, but not in adults. Interleukin 10 (IL-10), a global suppressor of the immune response (Moore et al., 2001), was the only Th2-related cytokine to be upregulated in MV-infected neonates. CCL2, which is associated with reduced microglial/macrophage activation in adult infection with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), (Trujillo et al., 2013) is elevated only in infected neonates (Table 2\n). MV-infected adults also expressed unique inflammatory genes that were not activated in the neonates. Adult mice show increased expression of the IFN\u03b3-inducible gene CXCL9 (17.67-fold) (Brice et al., 2001), which suggests that IFN\u03b3-responsive gene expression may be partially dependent on age. Of note, gene expression in uninfected neonates and adults revealed modest baseline differences in the absence of infection (Supplemental Table 1). For example, adult mice expressed higher baseline levels of IL-12a (3.98-fold), IL-17a (2.13-fold), and IL-2 (2.13-fold) in the brain than uninfected neonates. Of these cytokines, IL-12a was the only factor to be upregulated by the neonates upon infection (7.87-fold versus uninfected neonates, Table 1). Together, this data suggests that the majority of cytokines/chemokines that are induced upon infection are distinct from factors that show an age-dependent difference in uninfected controls.",

CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO and CD46+/RAG2-KO neonates expressed unique subsets of genes that were not upregulated in the immunocompetent CD46+ mice. CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO neonates upregulated CXCL1 in the brain, which can act as a neutrophil chemoattractant and may partially explain the greater neutrophil infiltration observed in these mice (Fig. 4) (Bozic et al., 1995). Surprisingly, CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO neonates also upregulated CXCL9, which is classified as an IFN\u03b3-inducible gene, suggesting that IFN\u03b3-independent pathways may also regulate CXCL9 expression in the CNS. The CD46+/RAG2-KO neonates, which demonstrated less mortality during infection, activated a number of genes that were not observed in the other neonates (Table 2, bottom panel). Various cytokines (IL-5, IL-7, IL-15, and bone morphogenic proteins (BMP) 2, 4, 6, and 7) and chemokines (CCL11, CCL17, CCL19, CCL22, CXCL16) were induced only in CD46+/RAG2-KO brains upon infection. However, comparison of the baseline gene expression between uninfected neonates demonstrates that CD46+/RAG2-KOs have lower basal expression of some of the factors that are upregulated during infection (e.g. the BMPs, CCL11, and CCL17; Supplemental Table 2) in comparison to the uninfected CD46+ neonates. Thus, although the CD46+/RAG2-KO neonates express many unique genes upon infection, a subset of these genes are expressed endogenously at low basal levels.",

Expression of IFN\u03b3 mRNA was higher in CD46+ neonates compared to CD46+/RAG2-KO neonates (Fig. 9A). Induction of IFN\u03b3 mRNA was also greater in CD46+ neonates than in adults (Fig. 9B). While we had observed the induction of some IFN\u03b3-responsive genes in both age groups (Table 1), adult mice also expressed IFN\u03b3-responsive genes that were not expressed in neonates (e.g. CXCL9), suggesting that neonatal mice may have impaired IFN\u03b3 signaling. To investigate the downstream effects of IFN\u03b3 signaling, we compared the mRNA expression of CIITA (Class II Major Histocompatibility Complex Transactivator), a critical regulator of MHC-II induction and a IFN\u03b3-responsive gene (Reith et al., 2005). There was no difference in CIITA expression among the three genotypes of the neonates (Fig. 9C), despite the expression of IFN\u03b3 in CD46+ (11.5-fold) and CD46+/RAG2-KOs (4.4-fold) neonates. However, CD46+ adults induced greater CIITA expression (11-fold) compared to uninfected controls and compared to infected CD46+ neonates (Fig. 9D), despite less expression of both IFN\u03b3 and MV. These results suggest that although IFN\u03b3 may be induced in the brain during infection, there may be deficiencies in IFN\u03b3 signaling or transcriptional activation in the neonatal brain.",

We treated neonatal mice lacking IFN\u03b3 with repeated injections of recombinant IFN\u03b3 at the start of infection and every 3 days thereafter until the mice succumbed to the infection. CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO neonates treated with IFN\u03b3 showed prolonged survival in comparison to untreated CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO neonates, although the IFN\u03b3-treated mice ultimately succumbed to the infection (Fig. 10A; p < 0.01 by Log-rank test). As we had observed limited immune cell infiltration in neonatal mice lacking IFN\u03b3, we examined the levels of infiltrating T cells into the CNS with IFN\u03b3 treatment at 7 dpi, which is when we first observed a divergence in the survival curves of IFN\u03b3-treated and untreated mice. The numbers of CD4 T cells in the brain was reduced with IFN\u03b3 treatment (Fig. 10B), while CD8 T cells numbers were unchanged (Fig. 10C). These results suggest that IFN\u03b3 exerts an anti-inflammatory effect in neonates that limits infiltration of some immune cells and prolongs survival during viral infections in the brain.",

Regardless, CD46+ neonates succumb to infection despite mounting a Th1-like, but apparently defective, inflammatory response. Our findings are consistent with the observation that neonatal immune responses are often ineffective at controlling viruses and other pathogens (reviewed in (Rouse and Sehrawat, 2010). However, our findings also contrast with many studies of neonatal peripheral infections, which suggest that a Th2-like bias (with IL-4 and IL-5 expression) predominates during anti-microbial responses (Adkins et al., 2004, Zaghouani et al., 2009).",

However, it is important to note that IFN\u03b3 also plays both pro- and anti-inflammatory roles in a variety of pathological conditions (Muhl and Pfeilschifter, 2003), in addition to roles in host defense. We reasoned that IFN\u03b3 may be protective in the developing CNS during an infection, where neurogenesis and synaptic refinement are active. We have previously shown that IFN\u03b3 protects the neural stem cell pool, but does not preserve neurogenesis, in MV-infected CD46+ neonates (Fantetti et al., 2016), suggesting that IFN\u03b3 can prevent neural stem loss but cannot prevent loss of function. In the current study, CD46+ pups lacking IFN\u03b3 succumb earlier to the infection despite greater infiltration of macrophages, neutrophils, T cells and higher microglial numbers than wildtype pups, which highlights the pleiotropic nature of this cytokine in influencing both leukocyte and neural cell activity. Our findings are also consistent with models of experimental autoimmune encephalitis and sindbis virus infection, where mice deficient in IFN\u03b3 signaling demonstrate more severe inflammation and T cell infiltration in the CNS (Lee et al., 2013, Willenborg et al., 1999). Therefore, it is possible that IFN\u03b3 plays a protective role by limiting inflammation in the brain during an infection, which is supported by our observation that IFN\u03b3 treatment limited CD4 T cell infiltration and prolonged survival (Fig. 10).",

This Th2 bias may be due to delayed maturation of accessory cells or intrinsic epigenetic factors in neonatal T cells. (Li et al., 2004). Th2-like responses are not typically associated with IFN\u03b3 production, which is a hallmark of Th1 responses (Schoenborn and Wilson, 2007). Given the significance of IFN\u03b3 in viral control in neurons, we predicted that the failure of CD46+ pups to control MV would be due to a Th2-bias in the brain. In neonates, we observed greater induction of IFN\u03b3 in response to infection as well as the induction of some IFN\u03b3-responsive genes (CXCL10, CXCL11). However, it is important to note that neonatal CD46+ mice failed to activate CXCL9 and CIITA (Table 1 and Fig. 9), both of which are IFN\u03b3-inducible genes, despite greater induction of IFN\u03b3 than adults. These findings suggest that IFN\u03b3 signaling may be limited in the neonatal CNS, at least in regard to the profile of genes that are activated. Previous studies in CD46+ neonates demonstrate elevated expression and activation of Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), the canonical signaling molecule downstream of IFN\u03b3, in the hippocampus during infection (Fantetti et al., 2016). However, both Type I and II interferons signal through STAT1, so it is possible that STAT1 activation in neonates does not reflect robust IFN\u03b3 signaling per se at 7 dpi, when Type I IFNs are also expressed. Regardless of the level of STAT1 activation, the disparity in the activation of IFN\u03b3-inducible genes suggests that the outcomes of IFN\u03b3 signaling may be dictated by age-related factors.",

The greater infiltration of neutrophils may contribute to the earlier death observed in the absence of IFN\u03b3, as neutrophil activation during viral infections can lead to tissue damage (Drescher and Bai, 2013, Stout-Delgado et al., 2009). C57BL/6 mice infected with influenza A virus require IFN\u03b3 to modulate neutrophil activity in the lung and prevent tissue pathology (Stifter et al., 2016). Thus, the heightened numbers of neutrophils, along with a lack of modulation of neutrophilic activity by IFN\u03b3, may play role in neuropathology in the CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO neonates. Greater numbers of macrophages/microglia were also noted in the absence of IFN\u03b3, which could contribute to pathology by the release compensatory cytokines (Ottum et al., 2015). Another possibility is that the expression of IFN\u03b3 limits T cell infiltration into the brain, thereby limiting cytotoxicity but also allowing for greater viral replication in CD46+ neonates. Previous studies in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-infected neonates demonstrate that IFN\u03b3 expression or administration in the lung leads to reduced recruitment of CD4 and CD8 T cells (Empey et al., 2012). Thus, a lack of IFN\u03b3 expression may allow for greater recruitment of immune cells into the CNS in CD46+/IFN\u03b3-KO neonates, thereby contributing to greater immunopathology and earlier death. Together, these studies suggest that neonatal expression of IFN\u03b3 during a viral infection confers an anti-inflammatory effect, which limits T cell recruitment and tissue damage.",

            "text": "The delay in mortality of the CD46+/RAG2-KO neonates with low viral load lends support to the idea that the neonatal T cell response may contribute to neuropathology. Although, the mechanism of protection in the CD46+/RAG2-KO mice requires further study, these findings suggest that the lack of adaptive immune response may be beneficial to survival in the infected neonates. Other models of viral CNS infections, including some strains of west Nile virus and dengue virus, show that the CD8 T cell response induces immunopathology while also providing protection against the virus (An et al., 2004, King et al., 2007). Cytotoxic T cells also play a more pathogenic role during infections with Murray Valley encephalitis virus, where mice lacking granule exocytosis showed prolonged survival (Licon Luna et al., 2002). Of note, while providing evidence for a detrimental role for T cell activity during a CNS infection, these studies were performed in adult mice, which contrasts with findings in the adult CD46+ model where viral control is not associated with immunopathology. The CD46+/RAG2-KO neonates were capable of expressing IFN\u03b3 during infection, which also suggests that other immune cells, such as neutrophils, were able to compensate for the lack of T cells through expression of key cytokines. A separate, but not mutually-exclusive explanation for the protection observed in CD46+/RAG2-KO neonates is the robust induction of IFN\u03b2. In studies of neonatal mice lacking the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR \u2212/\u2212), MV infection in the CNS was associated with greater mortality than in wildtype neonates (Kim et al., 2013). However, although primary neurons can express IFN\u03b2, exposure to IFN\u03b2 alone is insufficient to prevent MV replication in neurons (Cavanaugh et al., 2015). Thus, one possibility is that elevated IFN\u03b2 expression leads to activation of innate immune cells in the brain, which could subsequently contribute to the reduced mortality seen in CD46+/RAG2-KO neonates.",

The deletion of CD4 T cells alone results in death of adult CD46+ mice, whereas depletion of CD8 T cells is associated with less viral control but no changes in survival (Solomos et al., 2016). Within the adult brain, the CD4:CD8 T cell ratio revealed a greater proportion of CD4 T cells (5.9; Fig. 8). In C57BL/6 mice, which are the background strain of the CD46+ model, the CD4:CD8 ratios are relatively low in the spleen, as we also observed in splenocytes from the CD46+ adult mice (1.7; data not shown) (Myrick et al., 2002). During some viral infections, the CD4:CD8 ratio reverses to a greater proportion of CD8 T cells, where the CD8 T cells become necessary for viral clearance either through cytolytic or non-cytolytic mechanisms (Callan et al., 1996, Tripp et al., 1995). The high CD4:CD8 ratio in the adult CD46+ brains, where viral clearance is successful, may suggest that a greater proportion of CD4 help is required to respond to neuronal infections non-cytolytically. These observations in MV-infected adult mice contrast with our findings in CD46+ pups, where the CD4:CD8 ratio skewed toward CD8 T cells (Fig. 7). One possibility is that the low proportion of CD4 T cells does not provide sufficient stimulation to the CD8 T cells to produce a non-cytolytic response. Support for this idea is found in a model of neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus infection, where depletion of CD4 T cells impaired the anti-viral function and survival of infiltrating CD8 T cells (Phares et al., 2012). Thus, it is possible that the lack of adequate number of CD4 T cells in neonates may lead to inefficient activation of effector CD8 T-cells and a lack of viral clearance.",

Neonatal mice express the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which is classically associated with Th2-like responses and repression of Th1 cytokine synthesis (Couper et al., 2008). In the CNS, recombinant expression IL-10 is protective against virally-induced demyelination and lymphocyte infiltration (Trandem et al., 2011a). Endogenous IL-10 also protects against neuropathology caused by coronaviruses and flavivirus in murine models of adult infection (Trandem et al., 2011b, Tun et al., 2014). However, the lack of IL-10 induction in CD46+ adult mice suggests that IL-10 is dispensable for non-cytolytic viral clearance from neurons. Similarly, CD46+ neonates, but not CD46+ adults, upregulated TNF during infection. TNF is associated with neuroprotection in models of flavivirus encephalitis (Hayasaka et al., 2013, Tun et al., 2014). Thus, it is surprising that both IL-10 and TNF would be expressed in the neonatal CD46+ model, where viral clearance fails and neuronal dropout is apparent, but not in the adult CD46+ model, where viral control is successful. One possible explanation is that IL-10 induction in neonates dampens the expression of necessary anti-viral or neuroprotective cytokines but does not completely inhibit them, which may explain the extensive overlap in cytokine profiles between adults and neonates despite disparate outcomes in viral control and survival.",

Previous studies indicate that murine neonatal intestinal epithelial cells fail to express TLR3 in response to rotavirus infection through post-natal days 1\u201310, which overlaps with the time points reflected in our study (Pott et al., 2012). Similarly, human cord blood samples do not induce TLR3 in response to poly(I:C) treatment or HSV activation in comparison to adult NK cells (Slavica et al., 2013). In our model, we observed upregulation of TLR3 mRNA in CD46+ adults but not in CD46+ neonates, although TLR3 protein expression in the adult cerebellum and hippocampus did not reflect the changes in whole brain mRNA. In these brain regions, we have seen robust MV infection in the neonates; however, this is not consistently the case in the adult brains, where viral spread is more controlled. Thus, it is possible that the brain regions chosen for protein studies in adults did not always carry sufficient virus to stimulate protein expression of the TLRs. Although, we observed robust RIGI expression in the CD46+ neonates, there is also evidence in human neonatal dendritic cells that RIGI function is impaired and associated with attenuated control of RSV (Marr et al., 2014). Despite the varied expression of neonatal PRRs in our model, MV infection was associated ultimately with Type I IFN expression, albeit at a later time point during infection (7 dpi). Sindbis infection in neonatal mice is associated with robust Type I IFN expression, but the mice succumb to the infection regardless, much like the CD46+ neonates (Ryman et al., 2007). In contrast, RSV, LaCrosse virus (LACV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infections are associated with less robust Type I IFN responses that also fail to control the virus (Marr et al., 2014, Rudd et al., 2012, Taylor et al., 2014). CD46+ adult mice that are deficient in IFNAR demonstrate that Type 1 IFN signaling contributes to early viral control, but is dispensable for the ultimate resolution of the virus (Cavanaugh et al., 2015). As we did not observe significant upregulation of the Type I IFNs in CD46+ adults, we suspect that Type I IFN is undetectable in whole brain RNA because the expression may be restricted to regions of viral replication, which are relatively limited in the adult brain. Thus, while Type I IFN expression is invoked in many neonatal infection models, the anti-viral response associated with them are often less productive.",

            "text": "From these results, we propose that neonatal immune response is capable of inducing elements of a successful adult response in the brain, including IFN\u03b3 and other Th1-related cytokines, but may struggle with the extensive viral load that is produced in the developing neurons. Neurotropic viruses spread readily in less mature or newly-differentiated neurons, which may pose a greater challenge for viral control and clearance in the developing brain (van den Pol et al., 2002). This notion is supported by the observation that MV-infected neonates exhibit more widespread expression of viral antigen in multiple brain regions prior to T cell infiltration, which suggests that the virus spreads readily in neonatal brain tissue. IFN\u03b3 plays multiple roles during a CNS infection; however, the anti-inflammatory effects of IFN\u03b3 may be protective in the neonatal brain through modulation of immune cell infiltration. The combination of aggressive viral spread and a modified cytokine profile ultimately poses substantial challenges for the neonatal immune response in the brain.",
