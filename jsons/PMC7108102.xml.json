Reads are the basic element produced by DNA sequencing that are composed of a series of sequential bases (adenine, guanine, thymine, and cytosine) making up the DNA fragment, which can vary in size from small reads (75\u2013600 bp) to long reads (1000\u201310000s bp) depending on the sequencing technology. NGS overcomes many of the limitations of traditional Sanger sequencing, which requires targeted sequencing (preamplification of a known target, such as 16S rDNA) of a uniform or low-diversity sample (the sample ideally is composed of a single organism or a maximum of 3 organisms).",

Additional sources of nucleic acid that may be concurrently sequenced include nucleic acid introduced at the time of collection, within collection tubes, from the environment, and in sequencing reagents.

Successful clinical applications of mNGS have demonstrated that 0.00001%\u20130.7% of total reads (10 to tens of thousands of pathogen reads out of a total of millions of reads) have been used to make successful diagnoses (Table 1, mNGS results column). Pathogen reads make up a minute fraction of the sequencing results. Host nucleic acid can be depleted [18] or, if pathogen reads are enriched, more microorganism reads can be generated to more confidently provide a diagnosis and allow for increased analytical sensitivity (limit of detection). Additionally, if a robust immune response is generated in response to the pathogen, the specimen will contain a high concentration of leukocytes, further contributing to host nucleic acid in the sample and further limiting pathogen detection. Thus, the higher the sequencing depth (the higher number of reads generated/specimen) of the method, the higher the likelihood that the pathogen will be sequenced and detected (more reads equals higher sensitivity). For a conceptual illustration of how cellularity and overall nucleic acid affect analytic sensitivity, see Figure 1 in Schlaberg et al [4]. One potential advantage of sequencing amplified host nucleic acid is the opportunity to evaluate the host immunologic response associated with the presence and type of infection. This can include the presence of gene biomarkers associated with an antiviral or antibacterial response (specific expression of cytokines, chemokines, interferons, etc), genes involved in signaling pathways, and adaptive immunity. These biomarkers can provide insight into the pathogenesis of the microorganisms detected [19].",

Initial applications of mNGS focused on detection of pathogens in normally sterile specimens, such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain biopsies, simplifying the assignment of clinical significance for detected organisms [17, 20\u201323]. That being said, even body sites that are considered normally \u201csterile\u201d may contain a microbiome, which can be defined and detected by deep sequencing [24]. Reports in the literature are now showing applications from other specimen types where normal microbiota can further complicate interpretation of results, such as respiratory specimens [19, 25]. These methods will likely require further studies to determine the best approach to distinguish colonization from infection. Currently, mNGS is only able to quantify pathogen reads as a percentage of the total number of sequence reads. Clinical microbiology laboratories have developed procedures throughout the years to distinguish true pathogens from colonizers in cultures, and similar approaches are being developed for mNGS. A recent example is the use of \u201cspike-in\u201d\u2013based calibration to determine total microbial load as a proxy to convert percentage reads in relation to quantitating bacterial burden in colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter [26]. Another approach to distinguish colonization from infection is to monitor and assess the host immune response. Langelier et al found that expression of a multigene immune response composite metric was significantly increased in hematopoietic cellular transplant patients with confirmed respiratory pathogens relative to those without a defined pathogen. These results suggest that, even in patients who have significant immunosuppression, the immune response may be used as a biomarker of active infection when utilizing host reads from mNGS analysis of respiratory specimens [19].",

Samples should be collected with much caution; for example, lumbar punctures to obtain CSF specimens can be contaminated by normal skin microbiota during the procedure. Similarly, surgical specimens may be contaminated during handling of the biopsy [17]. In addition, specimen collection containers are ideally verified to be DNA/RNA free as they too may serve as a source of contaminating nucleic acid.

            "text": "Furthermore, many researchers have shown that most reagents utilized for mNGS also introduce extraneous, unwanted sources of DNA during the sequencing process; this phenomenon is referred to as the \u201ckit-ome\u201d [9]. A study by Salter et al demonstrated that extraneous DNA is ubiquitous in commonly used DNA extraction reagents and other laboratory reagents used for NGS. The contamination can critically impact results obtained from samples, especially those containing low microbial biomass [27, 28]. This becomes particularly relevant when there is a lack of an obvious pathogen (eg, Mycobacterium tuberculosis or JC virus where they are not found as contaminants in reagents or part of normal microbiota) especially for mNGS analysis of CSF specimens where common reagent contaminants can include members of the Enterobacteriaceae or Cutibacterium acnes (previously known as Propionibacterium acnes), making clinical relevance difficult to discern. Thus, it is imperative that a no-template control (a sample [ie, water or extraction buffer] that is run through the entire mNGS procedure) be included in mNGS analyses to determine the nucleic acid background of the reagents used for sequencing. The no-template control can be used when interpreting results to help filter out contaminating background reads. In fact, the no template control has been utilized as part of a cutoff to determine the relevance of mNGS findings from patient specimens. A recent report used a cutoff of \u226510 ratio of the reads per million sample divided by the reads per million of the no-template control from any given taxon (species, genus, or family) [21]. Another approach is to align the reads to the genome of the pathogen to see if the reads span different areas of the genome. If the reads are localized to a restricted area of the genome, the reads are more likely to represent a contaminant, whereas if the reads span the genome, the organism is more likely to represent a true organism detection [29].",

Methods of mNGS can include a DNA- and/or RNA-based approach. If a DNA-based approach is solely applied, pathogen types, except RNA viruses, will be detected. An RNA-based approach is required for detection of RNA viruses and further provides transcriptome-based analysis of other pathogen types and even the host immune response.

The reported limit of detection of mNGS from synthetic CSF matrix varies by organism type from a low of 0.01 CFU/mL for Cryptococcus neoformans, approximately 9 CFU/mL for Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus agalactiae, 9.4 copies/mL for cytomegalovirus, 55 organisms/mL for Toxoplasma gondii, and 100 copies/mL of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1, to a high of 130 CFU/mL of Aspergillus niger for detection [4]. This compares to 104\u20135 CFU/mL for detection of pathogens by special stains directly from a specimen (ie, Gram stain), 102\u20133 CFU/mL for growth in culture, and 10\u2013100 CFU/mL for nucleic acid amplification\u2013based methods [31]. It also varies by specimen type, as the limit of detection of mNGS for hepatitis C virus and HIV from plasma has been reported as high as 1 \u00d7 104 copies/mL, as determined by quantitative PCR [32]. Use of an internal control is extremely important to identify analytic failures and specimens with unusual cellularity that may result in reduced analytical sensitivity. While a negative mNGS result does not completely rule out an infectious process, adequate recovery of the internal control can indicate the level of sensitivity achieved by the assay for that particular sample [4]. Results will still need to be interpreted within a clinical context.",

Two bioinformatics pipelines have been applied successfully in most clinical studies, the \u201csequence-based ultrarapid pathogen identification\u201d (SURPI or SURPI+) pipeline and the Kraken pipeline [4, 17, 19\u201323, 29, 35].

Currently, most of these analytic tools require a significant degree of bioinformatics expertise that is typically not available in clinical laboratories [38].

These cases are examples of the power of NGS as a diagnostic tool. Initial applications of mNGS for diagnostics focused on central nervous system infections, mostly chronic infections, and have successfully diagnosed rare [22], novel [43], and atypical infectious etiologies [23] of encephalitis. One particular case of chronic Cache Valley virus encephalitis in an Australian patient highlights the ability of mNGS to identify pathogens not previously associated with a clinical phenotype [23]. A single report of the accuracy of mNGS compared to standard methods of 84 previously positive CSF specimens and 21 negative specimens observed a diagnostic sensitivity of 84.3% and specificity of 93.7% following discordant analysis [4].

All these studies have been performed using short read data (second-generation Illumina sequencing), with 2 exceptions. Recently, publications by Pendleton et al and Greninger et al demonstrated the utility of mNGS using the affordable, portable MinION sequencer (third-generation sequencing) that generates long reads with sequencing analysis that can occur in real time [25, 41]. The mNGS analysis of specimens by Pendleton et al resulted in a more rapid turnaround time of the pathogens causing lower respiratory tract infections than standard culture methods [25]. For the most part, the successful application of mNGS has occurred for diagnoses of severe, insidious infections or has been performed in retrospective studies compared to standard-of-care results. Ideally, this technology would be applied in real time as an adjunct to current SoC testing.",

The question is, when should this rather expensive test be considered for clinical care? Based on the available literature, mNGS could be considered when SoC testing is unrevealing and can be used as a last resort effort to try to discern an infectious process. Alternatively, it may be considered for critically ill or severely immunocompromised patients where achieving a timely diagnosis is imperative for improved outcomes. Importantly, mNGS does not replace current SoC methods, but should rather be used as an adjunct to these methods. At this point in time, this question is still actively under investigation and further evidence is required to establish the use of mNGS in routine clinical care.",

In addition, mNGS will further be developed in years to come to evaluate antimicrobial resistance genes, strain typing, pathogen evolution, immune response to offending pathogens, and detection of virulence genes. As mNGS methods are still being developed and NGS technologies are rapidly evolving, there are still challenges ahead in terms of data interpretation and patient privacy. Infectious disease clinicians and other treating physicians can actively participate in the quality management of NGS diagnostic applications by appreciating the complexities and nuances of the methodologies being applied and ensuring that steps, as discussed in this and other reviews, are implemented to generate meaningful results beneficial to patient care.",
