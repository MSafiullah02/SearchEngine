            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED), a devastating disease characterized by acute enteritis and severe watery diarrhoea followed by dehydration leading to death, and the virus is associated with high mortality rates in piglets (Song & Park, 2012). PEDV belongs to the family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales. This virus has a single\u2010stranded positive\u2010sense RNA genome of approximately 28 kb with a 5\u2032 cap and a 3\u2032 polyadenylated tail (Kocherhans, Bridgen, Ackermann, & Tobler, 2001; Pensaert & de Bouck, 1978). The PEDV genome is composed of the 5\u2032 untranslated region and at least seven open reading frames (ORFs) that encode four structural proteins, namely spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), and three major non\u2010structural proteins (1a, 1ab and ORF3) (Song & Park, 2012). Of the structural proteins, the S glycoprotein is the most diverse protein (Chen et al., 2013), and it plays a vital role in the induction of neutralizing antibodies and regulation of interactions with cellular receptors to mediate virus entry (Bosch, van der Zee, de Haan, & Rottier, 2003). It is also associated with growth adaptation in vitro and attenuation of virulence in vivo (Sato et al., 2011). The S protein has been utilized as an effective component for studying genetic relatedness among PEDV strains, examining their epidemiological status and facilitating vaccine development (Chiou et al., 2015; Lee, Park, Kim, & Lee, 2010; Puranaveja et al., 2009; Temeeyasen et al., 2014).",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhoea was first recognized in England in 1971 and later reported in several European countries (Pensaert & de Bouck, 1978; Wood, 1977). In Asia, PED has been reported since the 1980s, and it has become an economic concern for the swine industry in Japan (Takahashi, Okada, & Ohshima, 1983), China (Sun, Wang, Wei, Chen, & Feng, 2016), South Korea (Kweon et al., 1993), Thailand (Puranaveja et al., 2009) and Taiwan (Lin et al., 2014). Before 2010, the prevalence of PEDV infection was comparatively low with mostly isolated outbreaks (Song & Park, 2012). Since late 2010, new PEDV strains with increased pathogenicity compared to the classical strains emerged in China, and they are regarded as the first pandemic strains (Sun et al., 2016). In April 2013, highly pathogenic PEDV (US prototype, North American type) was first detected in the US, and it rapidly spread to 31 states as well as Mexico and Canada (Oka et al., 2014). Later, the second type of PEDV in the US with lower virulence in the field, designated S INDEL PEDV, was detected in samples collected beginning in June 2013 (Vlasova et al., 2014). Subsequently, US\u2010like strains have been reported in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and European countries such as Ukraine, Belgium, Germany, France, Slovenia and Netherlands (Lin, Saif, Marthaler, & Wang, 2016). In Vietnam, PED outbreaks were firstly confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) in the southern provinces in early 2009 (Duy, Toan, Puranaveja, & Thanawongnuwech, 2011). For Northern Vietnam, PEDV has been detected in severe outbreaks since the beginning of 2010 using commercial immunochromatographic assay kits (Diep, Lan, Hoa, & Yamaguchi, 2014). A previous study of PED in Northern Vietnam conducted in 2012 and early 2013 (Diep et al., 2014) revealed that the disease primarily occurred in the cold season lasting from November to April. Pigs of all ages were affected, manifesting diarrhoea at a rate of 92.0%\u2013100% in herds, and the mortality rate is as high as 93.8% (68.6% on average) in suckling pigs (Diep et al., 2014). A commercial PED live vaccine (strain KPEDV\u20109) has been used in pig farms in Northern Vietnam since 2011. Another more common immunoprophylaxis applied in the field is the artificial infection of sows (i.e., the feedback method) during pregnancy using pooled faeces and intestine collected from infected piglets (Song, Moon, & Kang, 2015). However, the effectiveness of these preventive measurements in the field is questionable because PED still occurred and frequently recurred in pig farms in which vaccination or the feedback method was applied. The persistence and reoccurrence of PED have been becoming more common in infected farms. To date, PEDV continues to spread widely and cause severe economic losses for the national swine industry. To identify the PEDV strains responsible for the recent outbreaks occurred from 2012 to 2015 in Northern Vietnam, we sequenced and analysed the full\u2010length S gene of PEDVs obtained from 25 affected pig farms. This result will provide useful insights into the molecular epidemiology in Vietnam and serve as the basis for the development of effective vaccines for controlling the disease.",

The number of samples from each province was as follows: Hung Yen (n = 9), Ha Noi (n = 6), Hoa Binh (n = 3), Thai Binh (n = 3), Vinh Phuc (n = 2), Quang Ninh (n = 1) and Son La (n = 1). Small intestine and stool specimens were taken from sucking piglets, post\u2010weaning pigs and sows exhibiting acute watery diarrhoea at 25 pig farms. Intestine samples were collected from dead piglets, and the faecal samples were non\u2010invasively collected immediately after excretion. Therefore, no aggressive operation was conducted in pigs for sampling purposes. Samples were prepared in 20% suspensions through homogenization with Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium with a low concentration of glucose. The suspensions were then vortexed and centrifuged at 2300 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. The clarified supernatants were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. Viral RNA was extracted from 300 \u03bcl of the samples and eluted in 30 \u03bcl of RNase\u2010free water using ReliaPrep\u2122 RNA Cell Miniprep kits (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. PEDV was detected in the collected samples by RT\u2010PCR using a newly designed primer pair (pM\u2010F/pM\u2010R) for amplification of a partial M gene (Table S1). The expected size of amplified product was 463 bp. One\u2010tube RT\u2010PCR was performed using AccessQuick\u2122 RT\u2010PCR System kits (Promega). Exactly 4 \u03bcl of RNA template was mixed with the reaction mixture, which contained 12.5 \u03bcl of AccessQuick\u2122 Master Mix (2\u00d7), 0.5 \u03bcl of each specific primer (10 \u03bcM) and 0.5 \u03bcl of AMV reverse transcriptase (5 u/\u03bcl). Then, 7 \u03bcl of nuclease\u2010free water was added to reach the total reaction volume of 25 \u03bcl. RT\u2010PCR was performed using a PCR Thermal Cycler (Takara, Japan). Following a reverse transcription step of 45\u00b0C for 45 min and an incubation step of 94\u00b0C for 2 min, 35 cycles were performed as follows: 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 53\u00b0C for 30 s and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. The cycles were followed by a final 10\u2010min extension step at 72\u00b0C. The RT\u2010PCR products were analysed by 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ultraviolet illumination after ethidium bromide staining.",

The PCR conditions were as follows: denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 2 min; 35 cycles of denaturation at 98\u00b0C for 10 s, annealing at 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and extension at 68\u00b0C for 2.5 min; and a final extension step at 68\u00b0C for 10 min. Then, the PCR products were used as templates for nested PCR to amplify five DNA fragments spanning the entire S gene using five published primer pairs (CS1\u2013CS5) (Diep, Norimine, Sueyoshi, Lan, & Yamaguchi, 2017). The amplified PCR products were purified using a FastGene Gel/PCR Extraction Kit (NIPPON Genetics Co., Ltd, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All sequencing reactions were performed in duplicate, and sequences were determined in both directions using BigDye\u00ae Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kits (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA).

The phylogenetic tree of the identified S genes was constructed together with other classical and recent strains isolated in Europe, Asia and North America. Phylogenetic analysis based on the nucleotide sequences of the S gene revealed two major clusters that were designated genogroup 1 (G1) and genogroup 2 (G2). G2 was further divided into G2\u20101 and G2\u20102, and G1 was divided into G1\u20101, G1\u20102 and G1\u20103 as shown in Figure 1. G1\u20101 includes the prototype European strain CV777, other global historic S INDEL strains isolated between 1970 and 2010 (Lin et al., 2016), and vaccine strains that were developed in Asian countries such as KPEDV\u20109 and attenuated DR13 from South Korea, P5\u2010V from Japan and attenuated CV777 from China. One Vietnamese strain (VN232/HB2013) in this study was clustered into this subgroup, and it was closely related to the previously reported Vietnamese strain HUA\u2010PED67 (2013) and Chinese strains CH7 (2011), JS\u20102004\u20102 (2004) and LJB03 (2006). G1\u20102 consisted of two classical strains isolated in Japan, namely NK and KH. G1\u20103 was composed of new emerging S INDEL strains. Notably, a Vietnamese strain in our study, VN262/HB/2014, was included in this subgroup. G2 primarily consisted of PEDV strains identified since 2010 in Asia, America and Europe. Twenty\u2010three Vietnamese field PEDV strains in this study were categorized into two subgroups of G2. Majority of Vietnamese strains in our study belonged to G2\u20102, which comprised 17 of 25 current Vietnamese strains along with high virulent non\u2010S INDEL strains identified in North America and Asia. Excluding VN97/HN/2013 and VN344/HN/2014 in this subgroup, which were closely clustered with Chinese strains, 15 other Vietnamese strains were grouped closest to North American non\u2010S INDEL strains identified in US, Mexico, Canada, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan (Chiou et al., 2015; Suzuki et al., 2015; Vlasova et al., 2014). Notably, three Vietnamese strains, namely VN01/HY/2013, VN12/HY/2013 and VN385/TB/2014, were most closely related to three Japanese strains (AOM\u20103/JPN/2014, 14JM126, 14JM226) and two US strains (USA/Minnesota90/2013, NPL\u2010PEDv/2013), and they formed a monophyletic branch. The remaining 12 Vietnamese strains were grouped in a segregated branch, and they were most closely related to the Japanese strain AOM\u20102/JPN/2014 and US strain USA/Minnesota/271/2014 (US). Six PEDV Vietnamese strains in our study were included in subgroup G2\u20101.

PED persistence and recurrent epidemics are often observed in PEDV\u2010infected herds. Outbreaks are also reported to occur throughout the year opposed to only in the cold season as previously reported. At present, the disease continues to widely circulate, becoming a major focus of farm owners. To better understand the prevailing PEDVs, full\u2010length S genes of PEDVs collected from different farms in Northern Vietnam were sequenced and analysed. The sequencing results revealed variations in length and various insertions and deletions in the S gene of Vietnamese strains. Sequence homology analysis of the S gene illustrated that the Vietnamese PEDVs were genetically diverse, displaying divergence in sequence identity with each other. Moreover, all Vietnamese strains were classified into four types corresponding to four subgroups. Taken together, these results indicated the heterogeneity among prevailing PEDVs in the northern provinces of Vietnam. They also suggested the need for multiple PEDV vaccine strains for preventing PED in Vietnam because the availability of vaccine strains that are genetically related to circulating viruses is critical (Song et al., 2015).",

Jarvis et al., (2016) reported that the evolution of US strains is estimated to have begun around July 2009 to August 2012. Although NA non\u2010S INDEL strains were proposed to have evolved from different emerging Chinese strains via recombination (Tian et al., 2014; Vlasova et al., 2014), no NA non\u2010S INDEL strains were isolated in China (Lin et al., 2016). The timing and mechanism of the appearance and global spread of the NA PEDV type remain unclear. In this study, we identified NA PEDV strains from PED outbreaks in South\u2010East Asia. Interestingly, some Vietnamese strains belonging to the NA type appeared earlier in Northern Vietnam than the earliest reported US strains. For example, VN101/HY/2012 was collected in December 2012. Although VN01/HY/2013 and VN12/HY/2013 were collected in January 2013, the strains were derived from two outbreaks that begin in December 2012. Therefore, the earliest PED outbreaks caused by NA strains in Northern Vietnam occurred as early as December 2012, approximately 4 months earlier than the first appearance of PEDV in the US. Additionally, sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Vietnamese strains of the NA type were most similar to the emerging US strains. Whether the US\u2010like PEDVs in Vietnam evolved independently via recombination from the domestic PEDV strains or originated directly from China remains unanswered. These possibilities are both highly feasible. The possible reasons are first, the NA Vietnamese PEDV strains appeared closely with the estimated occurrence of NA emergence (2009\u20132012) as reported by Jarvis et al. and last, the existence of Chinese\u2010like emerging PEDV strains in Vietnam could mean potentially parent strains for recombination that generated the US\u2010like PEDVs. On the other hand, Northern Vietnam shares a long border with China, and the export of live pigs (finished stage) from Vietnam to China has been extremely active with weak oversight. Therefore, the transmission of new PEDV strains between the two countries is highly possible. Further study is needed to clarify the origin and evolution of the NA strain\u2010like PEDVs in Northern Vietnam.",

Therefore, it is suggested that these PEDV variants were infectious. Of note, among these variants, 10 of them collected during PED outbreaks occurring in six different provinces between 2012 and 2015 had the same S gene sequence. It suggested that the variants were likely transmitted from one source of origin. In our study, an earlier stop codon in the S gene was observed in both the NA PEDV type (12 variants) and S INDEL type (VN262/HB/2014). This suggested that the truncated S proteins in the Vietnamese variants resulted from recombination or mutation events having the same mechanism.

The Vietnamese PEDV strain HUA\u201014PED96 (accession number KT941120), which was identified in a Northern province, was reported to have a unique 72\u2010nucleotide deletion in the ORF1a gene (Choe et al., 2016). Consistent with the previous results, several Vietnamese PEDV strains in our study were genetically similar to the reported Vietnamese strains and re\u2010emerging Chinese strains. Four strains in our study, namely VN292/HN/2014, VN367/VP/2014, VN\u2010K2/HY/2015 and VN\u2010TH15/HY/2015, were phylogenetically similar to HUA\u2010PED45 and HUA\u2010PED47. Notably, the four Vietnamese strains collected from three adjacent provinces formed a well\u2010supported branch. These results indicated that these PEDV strains might have derived from a common ancestral virus, the progeny of which spread in this region. Interestingly, strain VN297/HB/2013 in our study was genetically most similar to HUA\u201014PED96, and these two strains formed a monophyletic branch. This indicated that VN297/HB/2013 might also possess the same 72\u2010nucleotide deletion in ORF1a compared with HUA\u201014PED96, although more extensive genome sequencing is required to clarify this finding. In this study, we identified one novel PEDV strain, VN\u2010TH15/HY/2015, with an 8\u2010amino acid insertion between positions 380 and 381 of the S protein, which are located in the receptor\u2010binding domain (amino acids 253\u2013638) for porcine aminopeptidase N (Liu et al., 2015; Deng et al., 2016). It is revealed that the classical PEDV exhibited weaker sugar\u2010binding activity than the recently uncovered G2 isolates (Deng et al., 2016). Amino acid substitutions were also reported in the receptor\u2010binding region (Wang et al., 2016).

Phylogenetic and sequence analyses revealed that the current PEDV strains in Vietnam were genetically distant from the aforementioned vaccine strains. Antigenic analysis illustrated that compared to the vaccine strains, the circulating Vietnamese PEDVs were conserved in epitopes SS2 and 2C10 but had various substitutions in the COE domain and epitope SS6. In particular, substitutions in three positions, namely 496, 549 and 766 in the epitope regions of the S protein, were predicted to result in the formation of new phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylation of viral proteins is a post\u2010translational modification which can have major impacts on viral infection, survival, replication and cytotoxicity in a host cell (Keating & Striker, 2012). Phosphorylation is considered to introduce a change in the charge of the protein which results in a conformational change and alters the activation status of the protein (Keck, Ataey, Amaya, Bailey, & Narayanan, 2015). Therefore, the result suggested that these mutations in the epitope regions may lead to changes in the antigenicity of prevailing Vietnamese PEDVs and consequently influence the efficacy of the vaccines.",

A study of a lactate dehydrogenase\u2010elevating virus belonging to Coronaviridae reported that the acquisition or loss of N\u2010glycosylation sites in an envelope glycoprotein (VP\u20103P) could result in changes in virulence and cellular tropism (Li et al., 2000).

In particular, the high\u2010specificity sites 514 (NITV) and 566 (NVTN/NVTS) were promising markers of virus evolvement, as they are located in the COE region, meaning that small changes could possibly result in disturbances in the folding and conformation of the S protein.
