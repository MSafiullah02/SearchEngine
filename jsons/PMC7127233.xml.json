            "text": "Influenza is a viral zoonosis of birds and mammals that has probably existed since antiquity. In antiquity, populations were small and less concentrated, limiting influenza potential. As animals became domesticated and lived in close proximity to human populations, populations concentrated in urban centers, setting the stage for the introduction of zoonotic influenza into the human population. Influenza can maintain itself in rural populations because of ongoing changes in immunity mediated by influenza viral antigenic drift and shift. Because influenza immunity is strain-specific, influenza may be maintained and may result in epidemics in large, closed urban populations. Attack rates of influenza are relatively high but mortality is relatively eg \u223c 1 % low. Influenza mortality is highest in the very young, the very old, and the immunosuppressed. Influenza (human seasonal) has the potential for rapid spread and may involve large populations. Even though the mortality associated with epidemics is relatively low, the total number of fatalities involved may be huge. In the 1918\u20131919 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, the mortality rate was 1%, but because massive numbers of people were infected, there were 50 million fatalities.1, 2, 3\n",

The English physician described a \u201csweating disease\u201d characterized by fever, headache, and myalgias that killed some patients rapidly but lasted only a few days in those that survived. Although the English sweating sickness might have been due to influenza, the findings were nonspecific and did not resemble the first recognized influenza epidemic, which occurred in Germany, England, and Italy in 1173. Subsequent influenza epidemics occurred in France and Italy in 1323 and 1387. Villaini and Segui were the first to use the term \u201cuna influenza,\u201d referring to some \u201ccelestial influence\u201d that was thought to be responsible for the infection. The French described influenza as the grip, because patients appeared to be gripped or seized by influenza. Thousands of people were affected by these early epidemics but the first pandemic spread through Europe in 1510. In 1679, Sydenem provided the first accurate clinical description of influenza. In 1933, Smith isolated influenza A virus. Three years later, Burnette was the first to culture the influenza virus in embryonated eggs. In 1941, Hearst was the first to describe the hemagglutination reactions of influenza. Frances, in 1939, was the first to isolate influenza B and later in 1950, Taylor was the first to isolate influenza C.2, 3, 4\n",

In 1997, and again recently, outbreaks of avian influenza (H5N1) virus have occurred, affecting humans as well as poultry. Since 1997, avian influenza (H5N1) emerged in terms of lethality with a high mortality rate ie, 60% among young healthy adults, and has as yet unrealized pandemic potential. Avian influenza (H5N1) strain resembles the 1918 to 1919 pandemic strain. Fortunately, avian influenza (H5N1) outbreaks over the past decade have been limited with minimal person-to-person spread. However, avian influenza (H5N1), like the influenza A (H1N1) strain of 1918 to 1919, has pandemic potential if the virus mutates, permitting efficient person-to-person transmission. The influenza A (H1N1) pandemic of 1918 to 1919 was remarkable in many respects. The pandemic was unprecedented in its mortality and virulence, and was accompanied by 2 unusual sequelae, namely, encephalitis and postinfluenza Parkinson disease.5, 6, 7 The 1918 to 1919 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic was noteworthy in that the death rate was highest in young healthy adults.6, 8, 9, 10 The majority of the early deaths in young healthy individuals were due to influenza pneumonia alone and not simultaneous/subsequent bacterial pneumonia.4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16\n",

The swine influenza (H1N1) pandemic rapidly spread from Mexico to the United States and the world in the spring of 2009. The initial spread from Mexico was via tourists/travelers returning home from Mexico. Foci of swine influenza (H1N1) strains became established across wide geographic areas.17, 18, 19, 20 As with other influenza A pandemics, the initial \u201cherald wave\u201d (in the late spring/summer) involved large numbers of individuals with relatively few deaths. Lethal swine influenza (H1N1) pneumonia affected primarily young and healthy adults. The epidemiologic hallmark of pandemic influenza is its, \u201cpandemic signature,\u201d ie, most early mortalities are among young healthy adults. Human seasonal influenza affects primarily the very young, elderly, and those with comorbidities. Repeated passages through hosts, usually results in increased viral virulence. Excluding the effect of the (H1N1) vaccine, there is concern that subsequent waves of swine influenza (H1N1) may be more lethal than the first.8, 11, 21\n",

The single-stranded RNA influenza viruses differ in the length of their RNA segments, that is, influenza A and B have 8 RNA segments whereas influenza C has 7 segments. Influenza A, B, and C viruses are spherical and covered by a lipid envelope from host cell membrane. Influenza B and C have no subtypes. Subtypes are characteristic of the influenza A virus. Influenza A viruses are classified on the basis of their surface glycoproteins of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase agglutinating (NA) proteins. Influenza A viruses have 16 different HA and 9 different NA subtypes. However, only 3 HA subtypes and 2 NA subtypes have been implicated in human influenza epidemics. The 3 HA subtypes in human outbreaks are H1, H2, and H3, and the 2 NA subtypes are N1 and N2. The surface HA proteins are HA glycoproteins in a rod-shaped spike with a hydrophobic carboxy terminal based in the viral envelope. The hydrophobic end of the rod-shaped spike projects from the virus and is the binding site for sialic acid residues in host receptor cells. The HA surface glycoprotein is responsible for viral adherence to the host cell, whereas the HA glycoprotein is responsible for attachment of the virus and penetration of the influenza A virus into the host cell. The NA surface glycoprotein is mushroom-shaped and is also implanted in the lipid envelope at the amino acid end of the glycoprotein. NA glycoprotein cleaves terminal sialic acid residues, which are responsible for release of virus from infected host cells and spread of the influenza virus to other cells in the respiratory tract. Influenza viruses also have M2 proteins, which are important in uncoding the virus. M2 proteins, which are the matrix proteins, are present only in influenza A viruses and appear on the surface of infected host cells. M1 proteins are surface structural proteins important in viral budding.22, 23, 24\n",

The virulence of avian influenza (H5N1) remains worrisome.21 To date, avian influenza (H5N1) has been highly lethal in relatively small numbers of patients. It is thought that avian influenza (H5N1) is relatively inefficient in bird-to-human and human-to-human transmission, thus far limiting its human pandemic potential. With the swine influenza (H1N1) pandemic, although mortality rates are low, the potential for pandemic spread has been demonstrated during the spring/summer initial \u201cherald wave\u201d.

During the initial phase of the illness, there are high concentrations of influenza virus in respiratory secretions responsible for its spread via airborne transmission. One of the characteristics of influenza viruses is their changing antigenicity. Minor changes in surface glycoproteins resulting from stepwise point mutations in HA/NA glycoproteins are called \u201cantigenic drift.\u201d Sequential amino acid changes occurring over a period of years resulting in HA/NA glycoprotein changes occur every 2 to 3 years and are termed \u201cantigenic shift.\u201d Influenza epidemics occur every 6 to 10 years and are due to antigenic shifts exposing the population to strains to which it has not been exposed previously. For this reason, pandemic influenza A has a high attack rate in individuals of all age groups who are not susceptible, particularly children. Unlike epidemics of influenza that occur during the winter months, pandemic influenza may occur at any time and spread rapidly from country to country, facilitated by travel. The twentieth century has experienced 3 influenza pandemics, 2 of which have emerged from China. The highest late excess fatalities occur are among the elderly, who succumb to influenza because of comorbid conditions/bacterial complications, whereas early deaths among young healthy patients are most often due to severe influenza pneumonia alone.5, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26\n",

Severe human seasonal influenza A is accompanied by fever higher than 39\u00b0C/102\u00b0F and chills, accompanied by severe myalgias and dry cough with or without hemoptysis. Purulent sputum suggests superimposed bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) due to MSSA/CA-MRSA. Another noteworthy feature of human seasonal influenza is severe debilitating fatigue rapidly making victims bedridden. Prostration is profound and is accompanied by headache and prominent myalgias. Some infections present with myalgias, but the myalgias of influenza are peculiarly severe and are localized to the neck and back. Retro-orbital pain is common, and conjunctival suffusion may be present in severe seasonal human influenza A. Conjunctival suffusion may be present in avian influenza (H5N1) but is uncommon with swine influenza (H1N1). The clinical constellation of an ILI with fever higher than 39\u00b0C/102\u00b0F and severe myalgias especially of the neck/back, with profound prostration, clinically differentiates severe influenza A in adults from ILIs (Table 1\n).22, 23, 24, 25, 28, 30\n",

Another key laboratory finding in swine influenza (H1N1) patients is an elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK). Some patients with highly elevated CPKs may also have rhabdomyolysis. Seasonal human influenza A and avian influenza A (H5N1) may have mild to moderate elevations of the serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Whereas certain nonspecific laboratory abnormalities are typical of swine influenza (H1N1), for example, otherwise unexplained relative lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, mildly elevated AST/ALT, and elevated CPKs, other findings argue against the diagnosis, for example, elevated serum ferritin levels, hypophosphatemia, elevated cold agglutinin titers, and so forth.30, 31, 32, 34 In influenza (human, avian, swine) pneumonia, hypoxemia is a reflection of the severity of influenza in the interstitium of the lungs. Viral involvement of the lung interstitium may result in an oxygen diffusion defect manifested as hypoxemia and an increased A-a gradient. The greater the degree/duration of hypoxemia (A-a gradient >35), the more severe and potentially fatal is influenza (human, avian, swine) pneumonia.30, 31\n",

Rapid influenza A test positivity was usually predictive of RT-PCR positivity for swine influenza (H1N1). It was quickly realized that negative rapid influenza A testing did not rule out swine influenza (H1N1). False negative rapid influenza A testing for swine influenza (H1N1) was 30%. Respiratory FA viral testing detects influenza A, influenza B, metapneumoviruses, RSVs, parainfluenza viruses, and adenoviruses. Unfortunately, respiratory FA viral testing did not correlate with either rapid influenza A testing or RT-PCR testing. Although the definitive test for swine influenza (H1N1) diagnosis remains RT-PCR, during the pandemic, RT-PCR testing was restricted. Restricted RT-PCR testing resulted in tremendous difficulties in making/ruling out the diagnosis of swine influenza (H1N1) and in initiating/discontinuing influenza precautions.53, 54, 55, 59\n",

Amantadine and rimantadine has been used for influenza prophylaxis/therapy and act by interfering with the attachment of the virus to uninfected hosts' respiratory epithelial cells. The current anti-influenza antivirals currently available are zanamivir and oseltamivir. Both of these antivirals decrease the duration/severity of illness. Oseltamivir is administered orally but zanamivir is administered via an inhaler, which is problematic for some patients.30 Unfortunately, there is now widespread resistance to oseltamivir, greatly diminishing the therapeutic options in influenza and avian influenza (H5N1). At present, oseltamivir remains effective against most strains of swine influenza (H1N1). Oseltamivir is usually given for 5 days, but in severe cases, therapy has been given for 10 days. For severely ill hospitalized patients with swine influenza (H1N1) pneumonia unable to take oral medications, eg, oseltamivir, peramivir is available from the CDC for IV administration. In severe cases of influenza A, amantadine may have some role because of its effect on dilatation of the distal bronchioles. By increasing distal bronchiolar aeration, oxygenation may be improved, which may be critical in severe influenza A.60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67\n",

However, influenza A may be severe, and may be fatal in the very young and the elderly with impaired cardiopulmonary function. With pandemic influenza A, the prognosis depends on the virulence of the strain and may be fatal in young, healthy adults. Such has clearly been the case in the recent avian influenza (H5N1) epidemic in Asia whose fatalities, as in the 1918 to 1919 pandemic, were due in the main to influenza pneumonia and was frequently fatal without bacterial superinfection. Severe influenza A pneumonia with superimposed S aureus CAP have the worst prognosis. Others who initially present with influenza may later be complicated by subsequent bacterial pneumonia due to S pneumoniae or H influenzae, and have the same prognosis as noninfluenza patients with S pneumoniae or H influenzae CAP.",

In influenza, prognosis is worse in those patients who develop encephalitis. Following the 1918 to 1919 influenza pandemic, some patients developed Parkinson disease decades later. The prognosis in influenza depends on several factors including the virulence of the strain, the age/immune status of the host, cardiopulmonary function, and complications, for example, encephalitis or bacterial CAP.1, 2, 16 The most important intervention in adults with severe swine influenza (H1N1) pneumonia is prolonged ventilatory support. Because these patients are not complicated by simultaneous or subsequent bacterial CAP, empiric antimicrobial therapy seems to be unnecessary in swine influenza (H1N1) pneumonia. The degree and duration of relative lymphopenia/leukopenia as well as the severity and duration of hypoxemia are key prognostic indicators. An improvement in relative lymphopenia and a decrease in oxygen (FIO2) are predictive of recovery.",

Most lung specimens from autopsies of young healthy military recruits clearly show the pathologic changes of influenza alone.
