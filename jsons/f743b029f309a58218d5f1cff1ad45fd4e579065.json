Western blot supported that HD5 protected cells from the adherence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 1F) . Notably, SARS-CoV-2 S1 pretreated with HD5 was still efficient to contact Caco-2 ( Supplementary   Figure 2A) . Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions containing pLenti-GFP and dual-luciferase reporter system 4 were employed to determine the influence of HD5 on viral entry. Cells infected by the pseudovirions produced GFP and the fluorescence signal in the cytoplasm was visibly reduced in the cells pretreated with HD5 (Supplementary Figure 2B) .",

            "text": "Intestinal epithelium encounters trillions of microorganisms including various viruses. To cope with the microbial threat, intestinal cells have evolved to produce antimicrobial peptides including HD5, which is a lectin-like peptide able to bind lipids and glycosylated proteins 5 . In this study, we found a structure-dependent interaction between HD5 and ACE2. The binding of HD5 to ACE2 cloaked several sites in LBD, among which Asp 30 and Lys 31 are crucial for SARS-CoV spike to bind ACE2 6 . Accordingly, SARS-CoV-2 S1 binding and S pseudovirions entry to enterocytes were inhibited by HD5 (Supplementary Figure 2C) . To our knowledge this is the first study demonstrating the innate defense function of human intestine against SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "Our finding is a reasonable explanation to the clinical phenomenon that few intestinal symptoms are observed in COVID-19 patients 3 . Due to the deficiency in HD5, patients receiving small intestine transplantation or suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases such as the Crohn's disease, might be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 than the healthy 7 . HD5 also inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions entry to human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (Supplementary Figure 2D) , demonstrating an extensive protection of HD5. For the shortage of effective drugs to prevent and treat COVID-19, we think that it may be a useful strategy to increase the content of HD5 in vivo by oral administration as we recently described 8 . Immunofluorescence microscopy revealing the protection of HD5 on Caco-2 exposed to SARS-CoV-2 S1. SARS-CoV-2 S1 adhering to the cell surface is probed by a goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (Green). Nuclei are stained using DAPI (blue). The embedding graph in sham group shows cells treated with HD5. The region of interest in SARS-CoV-2 S1-treated group is magnified in the embedding graph. (F) Luciferase assay. The experiment was conducted in triplicate and repeated three times in different days. Results are shown as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Welch test indicated the differences among the groups excluding the sham group (F = 52.15, P = 1.51 \u00d7 10 -9 ). LSD test showed that, compared with the control group without HD5 treatment (n = 9; 148.2 (27.5%)), Caco-2 cells preincubated with HD5 for 1 h at concentrations of 10 \u00b5g/mL (n = 9; 68.88 (28.95 %); ****, P = 3.23 \u00d7 10 -10 ), 50 \u00b5g/mL (n = 9; 2.25 (47.07 %); ****, P = 2.89 \u00d7 10 -18 ), and 100 \u00b5g/mL (n = 9; 1.59 (37.69 %); ****, P = 2.48 \u00d7 10 -18 ) were less sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirons invasion.
