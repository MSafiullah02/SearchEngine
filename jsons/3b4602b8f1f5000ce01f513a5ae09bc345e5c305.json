We present ESOP, a novel application of active machine learning techniques using Bayesian optimization, that interacts with an epidemiological model to arrive at lock-down schedules that optimally balance public health benefits and socio-economic downsides of reduced economic activity during lock-down periods. The utility of ESOP is demonstrated using case studies with VIPER, a stochastic agent-based simulator that we also propose. However, ESOP can flexibly interact with arbitrary epidemiological simulators and produce schedules that involve multiple phases of lock-downs.

However, these works do not offer ways to find either the optimal moment to initiate suppression measures or their duration. This is important since Morris et al. [2020] , Patterson-Lomba [2020] show that the optimal initiation point and duration depend on the disease characteristics themselves. This is understandable since premature suppression slows the depletion of the pool of susceptible individuals leaving room open for a second wave of infections whereas delayed suppression may cause the initial wave to be widespread in itself. Scherbina [2020] additionally considers the economic impact of these measures and suggests durations for lock-down periods and their associated economic costs in medical expenses as well as lost value of statistical life.",

            "text": "However, it is challenging to perform this optimization using standard descent techniques [Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004] since even obtaining values of the function f at specific query points (let alone gradients) is expensive as it involves querying simulators such as VIPER. An acceptable solution in this case is Bayesian optimization [Jones et al., 1998 ] which is an active machine learning technique used to optimize functions which are expensive to evaluate and to which, moreover we do not have access to gradients. The technique adaptively queries the function at only a few locations to quickly approximate the solution to the optimization problem. Fig 1 outlines the basic steps in Bayesian optimization. Lack of space does not permit a detailed overview and we refer the reader to [Frazier, 2018] for an excellent review. ESOP additionally employs multi-scale search and caching techniques to accelerate computations. For Fig 2(b) , ESOP was asked to suggest when to start a 30 day lock-down at level 5. It suggested starting at t = 33 with the peak reducing to 8200 . Fig 2(c) shows that ESOP achieved the globally optimal initiation point within just 12 calls to VIPER (see inset figure) . For Fig 2(c) , VIPER was queried with all i \u2208 [0, 100] to explicitly find the globally optimum. Fig 2(d-f) show the same results but for a viral strain that has an incubation of 10 days instead of 3 days. The optimal initiation point depends strongly on the incubation period of the virus but ESOP discovers it in both cases. Also note that the number of non-quarantined infectious individuals continues to rise (see Fig 2(b) and (e) insets) even after imposition of lock-down due to the incubation period of the disease (rise is longer if the incubation period is longer). lock-down #1 lock-down #2 (by ESOP) Figure 3 : For Fig 3(a) , ESOP was asked to suggest a lock-down (no constraints on duration etc). It suggested one at level 3.5 starting t = 3, lasting 69 steps, resulting in a peak of 303 infections (much smaller than the peaks in Fig 2) and 1092 predicted cases of unemployment. f eco prevents the lock-down from going on indefinitely. The suggested lock-down seems to adopt a containment strategy, initiating a moderate-level suppression very early on to deplete the pool of infectious individuals. Note that the pool of non-quarantined infectious individuals is indeed exhausted by the time the suggested lock-down is over, preventing a second wave of infections. For Fig 3(b) , ESOP was forced to suggest a lock-down starting no earlier than t = 12 and no longer than 40 days. Since infections are already rampant by t = 12, ESOP adopts a mitigation strategy of starting a lock-down at t = 30 for 40 steps at level 3.5, causing a peak of 7353 infections and 560 cases of unemployment. Notice that the lock-down is delayed strategically so that the second wave that comes thereafter does not have a higher peak, thus balancing the two peaks indeed as dictated by f epi . For  Fig 3(c) , ESOP was given a situation where an earlier lock-down (green shading) had already taken place but was ineffective and left alone, would have caused a massive second wave with a peak of 14384 (dotted orange curve). ESOP suggests a second lock-down starting at t = 56 lasting 35 steps at level 4 which brings the peak down to a much lower level of 8447 and causing 560 additional cases of unemployment.",

As Tab 1 explains, individuals with viral loads over a threshold QTH get quarantined with a probability profile. Using greater screening and public awareness, this profile can be altered. Fig 4 shows the health and economic benefits of the same.",

As shown in Sec 4, whenever multiple waves of infection are unavoidable due to constraints on lock-downs, ESOP offers lock-down schedules that balance the peaks of these multiple outbreaks, ensuring no peak is too high. To maximize the impact of methods such as ESOP, close interaction and collaboration is needed with experts in the epidemiological and social sciences to better align ESOP with professional epidemiological forecasting and economic forecasting models. ESOP's interaction with these models is of a black-box nature which makes integration smoother and simpler.",
