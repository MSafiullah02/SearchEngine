            "text": "The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is the second novel zoonotic disease infecting humans caused by coronavirus (CoV) in this century. To date, more than 2200 laboratory-confirmed human cases have been identified in 27 countries, and more than 800 MERS-CoV associated deaths have been reported since its outbreak in 2012 [1]. Rapid laboratory diagnosis of MERS-CoV is the key to successful containment and prevention of the spread. Nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT, e.g., real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction [real-time RT-qPCR]), virus isolation, transmission electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and serological methods (e.g., antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] and immunofluorescence assay [IFA]) have been developed and used for MERS-CoV diagnosis [2\u20137]. While the \u201cgold standard\u201d for MERS-CoV diagnosis is NAAT of the upper region of the envelope gene (up-E) or the nucleocapsid (N) gene as suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO), antigen capture ELISA assay for MERS-CoV can also be informative when NAAT is not available or when the serological assay is used to confirm the findings and aid treatment decision [2, 3].",

To avoid cross-contamination from amplicons in NAATs, the workflow usually requires four separate physical locations: (1) sample preparation (lysis, extraction of nucleic acids, and reverse transcription), (2) NAAT master mix preparation, (3) template addition, and (4) amplification and analysis. Though technologies like real-time RT-qPCR simplify the workflow, such requirements limit the assay to be performed in regional laboratories designed or designated for this application. Antigen capture ELISA, on the other hand, can be performed on open bench in a single location after virus inactivation, allowing it to be performed in even the most minimally designed facility.",

For performing NAATs at a modern standard, UV cabinets or workstations for master mix preparation and sample addition, thermal cyclers, agarose gel running, and visualization equipment are the least requirement. For more stringent testing and faster turnaround, it calls for a real-time PCR thermal cycler (e.g., Roche\u2019s LightCycler systems or Bio-Rad Touch detection systems) which requires a fair amount of initial investment and limits the assay from being performed in remote or less developed locations. In contrast, antigen capture ELISA and other serological methods can be performed with much simpler equipment. Multichannel pipettes, automatic plate washer, and plate reader are the only specialized tools needed for this application and can be purchased with ease if those are not already available.",

As the nasopharyngeal aspirate viral load from patients during acute infection are around 106 copies/mL and nasal samples in dromedaries are usually around 104\u2013106 copies/mL, this test offers sufficient sensitivity for MER-CoV diagnosis and screening [9\u201311].",

To detect seroconversion from previous infection of MERS-CoV, the WHO suggests laboratories to perform IFA or ELISA together with neutralization assay, the result alone can be used to determine if it is a confirmed case, regardless of the results from NAAT assay [2]. For rapid on-site diagnosis of MERS-CoV, we have previously reported the adaptation of the antigen capture ELISA in the format of lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA ). This assay can yield results in under half an hour, requires minimal equipment, training, and can be stored at room temperature, thus allowing it to be performed in the field [12]. This LFIA is also able to detect MERS-CoV-like viruses (e.g., Tylonycteris bat CoV HKU4 and Pipistrellus bat CoV HKU5) and is useful for the research to understand the evolutional history of MERS-CoV[13, 14].",

Evaluations and characterization to determine the specificity and sensitivity have to be performed to establish the optimal dilution for the highest signal-to-noise ratio.Prevent the microtiter plates to dry up by placing the plates in a box with some moist tissue paper laying under while storing in an incubator or on a rack in a warm water bath.There are many viral lysis buffers available for purchase from bio-reagents vendors, e.g., buffer AL from Qiagen. Readers could request samples and perform their own testing on the conditions required to efficiently inactivate MERS-CoV.TMB solutions are normally purchased from bio-reagents vendors at ready-to-use dilations, follow manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n",
