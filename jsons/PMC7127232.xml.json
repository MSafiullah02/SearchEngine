Traditional method of culture-based fungal identification is a time consuming process with some fungi requiring up to 6 weeks of growth before identification can be made. Such lengthy turn-around-times do not meet the clinical need for management of fungal infections, which are increasing in frequency given the ever-enlarging immunocompromised patient population, largely driven by widespread use of immune-suppressive and immune-modulatory therapies (Harpaz et al., 2016). Rapid and accurate identification of fungal pathogens is known to impact on the appropriate antifungal drug choice, since fungal pathogens exhibit different antifungal susceptibility profiles (Albataineh et al., 2016, Perlin et al., 2017).",

Each technology varies in sensitivity, breadth of coverage, rapidity and ease of use. Technologies such as PCR provide rapid and sensitive detections of specific targets e.g. Aspergillus species directly from clinical specimens (White et al., 2015), but remain limited due to inability to detect the breadth of potentially invasive fungi. PCR/ESI-MS is a technology that combines the rapidity and sensitivity of PCR with the breadth of database coverage of more than 200 fungal species.",

Unlike these previous studies, our current study determined both analytical and clinical performance of the PCR/ESI-MS assay in patient-consented prospectively collected BAL samples. For the analytical performance, sensitivity (or limit of detection) and specificity of the PCR/ESI-MS assay for fungal detection (that were lack in previous publications) were assessed. For the clinical performance, the PCR/ESI-MS method was applied to prospectively collected BAL specimens obtained from patients suspected of, or at high risk for, pulmonary fungal infections. In addition, an updated detection platform, capable of handling larger input volumes (5 mL vs. 1 mL), with an improved signature database and a more rapid processing time (<7 hours sample to answer), was used. Results were analyzed relative to comparator standard care of mycology laboratory testing, which included culture, biomarker, histopathology, and molecular data, along with clinical data from the same patients.",

An additional 231 non-pathogenic fungi which were found to have little or no history of human pathogenicity were included in the assay database and reported under a non-specific fungal detection category. The pre-filled 16 well assay strips contained 15 primers targeted against widely conserved fungal genes in the small and large ribosomal subunits, as well as against more narrowly conserved ribosomal genes found in fungal mitochondria and the beta-tubulin gene. The distribution of this gene across the fungal divisions was shown in Supplement Fig. 1. A sixteenth primer was used for to control for extraction and amplification. These primers, PCR cycling conditions, and the extraction method have been shown in previous publications (Massire et al., 2013, Shin et al., 2013). After PCR amplification, the desalting method purifies the amplified nucleic acids, which are then loaded onto the ESI-MS module. The mass of the resulting amplicon is determined and the nucleotide base composition of this amplicon is calculated based upon the mass and the known nucleotide sequences of the PCR primers and target genome regions. Base compositions are determined for each unique amplicon in each well of the assay, and compared against a curated database. This database contains base composition signatures developed using data both gathered empirically and simulated from known sequences acquired from GenBank. A final identification is then triangulated using the information generated from each assay primer pair.",

Failure to detect this control was indicative of an issue with sample extraction or other downstream failures. (2) An amplification control, or calibrant, was part of the assay formulation for each well of the assay. Each calibrant was a synthetic DNA construct design to be amplified by its associated primer pair and to be easily distinguishable from organism targets by the analysis algorithm. The calibrant was used both to reduce low levels of background noise produced by the PCR and to control for amplification issues in the absence of target template. (3) Peptides of known masses were introduced during the desalting and ESI-MS processes to provide a positive indication of the successful execution of the desalting and electrospray ionization steps, and to provide precise calibration points for the analysis of the spectra produced by the mass spectrometer.",

Aspergillus sp. was found to be a frequent colonizing pathogen in the airway in these populations. The development of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis depends on the level of the host immune deficiency (Patterson et al., 2016). Approximately 57% (20/35) of the isolated Aspergillus cases were judged to be related to pulmonary infections. In the 18 cases of probable pulmonary aspergillosis detected by PCR/ESI/MS, 83% (15/18) were concordant with culture, and half of these cases had increased galactomannan values. The PCR/ESI-MS system is rapid (6\u20138 hours) in comparison with culture-based methods, and can be performed directly on uncultured BAL specimens, enabling earlier targeted therapy. In this study, there was no administration of antifungals before bronchoscopy for clinically relevant specimens which were culture-positive for Aspergillus, while voriconazole, posaconazole, or amphotericin B had been used for those Aspergillus detections by PCR/ESI-MS, indicating the potential advantage of this approach in cases where prophylactic antifungal treatment has been initiated prior to specimen acquisition. Although PCR methods potentially have high sensitivity, there were two probable aspergillosis cases missed by PCR/ESI-MS, which could be due to poor quality of the specimens resulting in low yield of Aspergillus DNA (Alanio and Bretagne, 2014).",

            "text": "\nP. jirovecii remains one of the most common opportunistic pathogens in AIDS patients and occurs in patients with other causes of immunodeficiency (Thomas Jr. and Limper, 2004). The standard reference method for diagnosing P. jirovecii is a direct fluorescence microscopy assay on specimens obtained by BAL (Procop et al., 2004, Choe et al., 2014). There were 7 additional P. jirovecii detections by PCR/ESI-MS that were negative by DFA. We didn't confirm these cases by another molecular assay. However, all these patients were immunocompromised patients (Table 3) and all except one had clinical presentations and radiological evidence to support the clinical diagnosis of the disease. AIDS patients often have a high-burden of P. jirovecii, with a previous study showing DFA assay positive rate as high as to 55% (Choe et al., 2014). The detection rate by DFA in this study in the nine clinical-suspicious-PCP-infection HIV patients was 77.8% (7/9), while by PCR/ESI-MS was 100% (9/9). In the five non-HIV patients, detection of Pneumocystis was negative by DFA but positive by PCR/ESI-MS (Table 3). Patients whose immunocompromised state is not due to AIDS usually present a low burden of P. jirovecii and are difficult to diagnose microscopically (Seah et al., 2012, Fauchier et al., 2016). Our results showed positive P. jirovecii detection by PCR/ESR-MS only in non-AIDS immunocompromised patients. This finding was consistent with previous studies demonstrating that real-time PCR assays increased sensitivity to detect P. jirovecii infection (Hauser et al., 2011). Therefore, PCR/ESI-MS could serve as a more rapid, sensitive and specific technology for the detection of P. jirovecii, especially in non-AIDS immunocompromised patients. Certainly, more cases are needed for conclusive assessment. One case detected by PCR/ESI-MS was thought to be free of PCP pulmonary infection due to lack of corresponding clinical presentations and radiological evidence for the infection. P. jirovecii can be colonized in both HIV and non-HIV immunocompromised patients (Frealle et al., 2017). Although there are no definitive evidence suggesting the risk of reactivation and evolution of the colonization, the progression to pneumonia may need to be evaluated in cases of long-time usage of specific drugs such as cytokine blockers (Morris and Norris, 2012). The fungal biomarker \u03b2-D-glucan could be an additional useful test with high negative predictive value for the diagnosis of the disease and prognostic value for monitoring the patient treatment (Onishi et al., 2012, Damiani et al., 2013, Kutty et al., 2016).",

Growth of Malassezia requires specific fungal culture media, which is most likely to be the reason for the universally negative culture results for the organisms detected by PCR/ESI-MS. Recently, Malassezia fungemia, peritonitis, arthritis and pulmonary infection have been reported in immunocompromised patients including neonates, diabetics with dialysis, and patients recovering from stem cell or solid organ transplantation (Tragiannidis et al., 2010, Velegraki et al., 2015, Pedrosa et al., 2018). Patients on total parenteral nutrition are thought to at risk of this infection (Baker et al., 2016). Although the two patients yielded clinically relevant data to support possible Malassezia infection detected by PCR/ESI-MS in this study, the definitive diagnosis of Malassezia infection in these 2 cases needs to be confirmed by another molecular method. Both patients were in a severely immunocompromised state, and lived only short periods of time following collection of the specimens studied here. PCR/ESI-MS offered a way to detect this potential pathogen in an immunocompromised population.",

This demonstrates the clinical utility of the technology, especially when applied judiciously within the appropriate treatment context. Additionally, in a clinical setting these results would be provided to the treating clinician within hours, as opposed to the days to weeks that can be required for the results generated from culture based methods. The range of fungi which can be detected by the technology also reduces the testing burden required for a given patient, as current molecular technologies can generally only detect a limited number of fungi. Furthermore, the automated molecular identification provided by the system does not require specialized training and knowledge required for microscopic identification of fungi from culture or histopathological specimens. It has been noted that improving the ease and rapidity of fungal diagnosis will have a positive effect on patient outcomes and hospital costs (Arvanitis et al., 2014).",

Multiplex PCR and DNA sequencing analysis of patient specimens are among the technologies that can provide a utility similar to that which has been demonstrated here for PCR-ESI/MS. The broadening of the diagnostic toolkit available to clinicians, and the accompanying gains in speed and accuracy of diagnosis, could help to improve patient outcomes, reduce hospital costs and help combat the spread of antibiotic resistance. Unfortunately, PCR-ESI/MS was removed from the market by Abbott Laboratories in 2017 primarily due to financial consideration (Ozenci et al., 2018). However, our present data, as well as a recent publication using PCR-ESI/MS to improve fungal diagnosis in hematological patients (Krifors et al., 2019), sheds new light on the importance of developing these non-culture based broad panel molecular assays to enhance the detection of fungal pathogens in those patients with invasive fungal infections. The continuing development and clinical investigation of these technologies should be pursued.",
