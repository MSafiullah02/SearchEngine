The past few months (the exact duration depending on our locations) have been unprecedented in our professional and personal lives, as people across the globe face and respond to the increasing threats posed by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). I hope you and your loved ones continue to stay safe and healthy in this difficult time. We should all express our sincere gratitude to the healthcare workers who are fighting for us on the front line, who do not have the option to work from home. I know you are probably as frustrated as I am about not being able to carry out the requested important experiments to revise an exciting manuscript (please see a recent editorial about this 1 ), but we must do our parts to help \"flatten the curve\" and hence accelerate the process for all of this to pass (and yes, this will pass eventually).",

            "text": "I must confess that, even though I generally understood the potential impacts of a pandemic that could propagate exponentially, the accelerating pace of this global crisis and the extent of its impacts on everyone's daily life surprised me. When I was traveling internationally in mid-February of this year to attend conferences in Australia, coronavirus was already on everyone's mind and a common topic of discussion, but it mostly seemed to be a distant problem only for our scientist colleagues in China (or at most, from East Asia). I could not have imagined that we would be shutting down lab research activities and working from home in just another month in the small city of Madison, Wisconsin in the Midwest of the United States and that those conferences would be the last ones I would attend in the first half of 2020 (or maybe even most of this remaining year). But in retrospect, should the emergence of this crisis have been so surprising to us given the many dire warnings we have received over the years from our top infectious disease experts and global health leaders 2 and the several recent, smaller-scale but no less deadly, epidemic outbreaks? As the initial shock and confusion dissipated and the reality and routines of staying at home sank in, I began to see the connections between the COVID-19 crisis and the climate change challenge 3 that motivates many of us working on renewable energy research ( Figure 1 ). No, I am not talking about the noticeable reduction of air pollution and carbon dioxide emission due to the shut downs, 4 which indeed has been observed and will contribute to the mitigation of climate change (though maybe temporarily). Instead, what I mean is that there are actually many parallels between the challenges in fighting this global pandemic and fighting the climate change in the longer term. This clear and present COVID-19 crisis should serve as a wake-up call for us to act now and work even harder to prevent a climate crisis. Let me explain:",

By the time the coronavirus hit our big cities hard and the hospitals began to be overwhelmed, only then did most of us realize the severity of the challenge. But in some sense, it was already too late. We could ask ourselves what we could have and what we should have done a few weeks prior to that point (e.g., enact social distancing measures 5 ) to avoid, or at least slow down, the imminent exponential explosion of patients, or a few years before in terms of the small investments in monitoring, prevention, and preparedness that could have helped to minimize the impact of the pandemic. 2 We will not be able to turn back the clock to reverse the loss of lives, even though the peak of the pandemic will pass and some new normalcy in life will return. Similarly, by the time the truly catastrophic consequences of climate change materialize, it could be too late and we might not be able to do anything fast enough to significantly reverse the damages, or the economic costs to do so would be much more daunting. The less immediate time frame of climate change is more dangerous as it makes it easy for us to be complacent and just \"kick the can down the road\".

We are all in this fight together, so we (scientists, specifically, and society, in general) need to work collaboratively to address the challenges. In the case of COVID-19, the global data sharing and collaborations have been impressive. 6 The genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was determined and uploaded online on January 11 by Chinese scientists. By January 23 the PCR test for the SARS-CoV-2 was developed by German scientists and then quickly mass produced in China, South Korea, and many East Asian countries and also distributed by WHO to enable the rapid testing, isolation, and treatment of the patients. Based on such genetic sequences, the first RNA vaccine was designed and developed in the United States within a record two months. The biomedical research community not only acted with the utmost sense of urgency but also worked collaboratively across the globe. Many research papers, often authored by multiple institutions from multiple countries, were posted on various preprint servers before official publication, so that everyone could immediately build on others' research results. Similarly, the understanding and modeling of climate change has been a global collaborative effort over the last few decades through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). 3 This is a model everyone can aspire to and learn from.",

We could also integrate solar energy production with energy storage. 11 We can produce chemicals and fuels efficiently using renewable electricity using new electrocatalysts 12, 13 or generate electricity from all kinds of fuels more efficiently using advanced fuel cells. 14, 15 Electrifying transportation can reduce the consumption of fossil fuels (despite the temporary historic negative crude oil price), so greater capacity, less costly, and safer Li-ion batteries are needed. We can minimize the energy consumption in lighting with more efficient LEDs and reduce heating and cooling cost with energy-saving windows in buildings. 16 The scale and diversity of the renewable challenges are so enormous that we need all of the above and we need them as soon as possible to solve the challenges facing us. The energy research community (us) must take on the scientific and technological challenges collaboratively with the utmost sense of urgency now.
