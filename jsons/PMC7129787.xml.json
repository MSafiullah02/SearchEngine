            "text": "Many bioactive peptides of diverse structures are produced via a template-directed manner by multimodular enzymes called nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) [1]. A common feature of such nonribosomally synthesized bioactive peptides is their macrocyclic structure, which causes reduction in structural flexibility and may therefore constrain them into the biologically active conformation [2]. Macrocyclic products are released from NRPS assembly lines usually by the action of C-terminal thioesterase domains (TE domains, cyclases). These accomplish product release by diverse mechanisms, mainly including a head-to-tail or branched side chain cyclization resulting in the formation of the final cyclic product 3, 4. Excised TE domains, separated from their biosynthetic machinery, are active enzymes in vitro when provided with substrate mimics. Due to the fact that stereoselective peptide cyclization is a difficult task in organic synthesis, chemoenzymatic methods have emerged for the production of natural products and their derivatives [5]. These approaches combine substrate generation by solid-phase peptide synthesis and stereoselective cyclization utilizing excised TE domains.",

            "text": "Based on the mechanism of peptide assembly and product release, NRPSs can be subdivided into three different classes [6]. Best characterized are the linear NRPSs (Type A), which are exemplified by the tyrocidine and the surfactin synthetases [1]. In these systems, the sequence of the assembled peptide chain is entirely determined by the number and order of modules within the corresponding peptide synthetase. Several TE domains of linear NRPSs are biochemically and structurally well characterized and are frequently used in chemoenzymatic approaches to generate macrocyclic peptide derivatives 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. In contrast, iterative (Type B) and nonlinear (Type C) NRPS assembly line templates are more complex. For example, iterative synthetases use their modules and domains more than once to assemble their final products from repetitive building blocks. Prominent candidates for the iterative mechanism are the antibiotic gramicidin S, the siderophore enterobactin, the antitumor agent thiocoraline, and the potent anti-SARS-CoV valinomycin, as well as the anticancer drug bleomycin and the siderophore yersiniabactin for nonlinear NRPS-PKS hybrids 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. To clarify the mechanistic aspects and to explore the biocombinatorial potential of the iterative reaction, we investigated the TE domain of the gramicidin S synthetase for its substrate specificity, ligation capacity, and cyclization potential.",

            "text": "Gramicidin S is a potent and well-characterized antibiotic synthesized by Bacillus brevis\n[14]. It is a cyclic decapeptide with the primary structure cyclo(-d-Phe1- l-Pro2- l-Val3- l-Orn4- l-Leu5 -d-Phe6- l-Pro7- l-Val8- l-Orn9- l-Leu10-), which is assembled on the GrsA and GrsB peptide synthetases that comprise one and four modules, respectively (\nFigure 1). The modular organization of the peptide synthetases suggests a mechanism in which the gramicidin TE (GrsB TE) serves as a holding bay for the gramicidin linear pentapeptide intermediate. After formation of the first pentapeptide, the TE domain awaits the assembly of the second pentapeptide and catalyzes the dimerization and the release of the cyclic decapeptide lactam. This type of mechanism was first proposed by Stoll et al. back in 1970 and was previously supported by mass spectrometric studies on the TE domain of the iterative enterobactin (Ent) synthetase 15, 20. Early studies also discussed enzyme dimerization, and they determined that the utilization of two TE domains to catalyze this two-step mechanism would lead to the same product. However, this seems rather unlikely, as it has been shown for GrsA and the iterative enterobactin synthetase EntF, harboring the TE domain, that NRPSs work as monomers [21].",

To define the borders of the TE domain, we performed sequence alignments, which revealed that the published borders of gramicidin thioesterase [7] comprise about 25 amino acid residues as an N-terminal extension compared to most characterized linear TE domains 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Sequence alignments of GrsB TE with the iterative TE domains of EntF, DhbF, and TioS revealed that this N-terminal extension seems to be a unique feature of GrsB TE (\nFigure 2). Based on these sequence alignments, it was possible to define two putative N-terminal borders of the GrsB TE domain. Based on this finding, a long version (TELong, 33 kDa, 275 residues) and a short version (TEShort, 30 kDa, 250 residues) were cloned and expressed in the soluble and active forms (Figure S1). Comparison of the reaction time courses of GrsB PCP-TE and GrsB TELong incubated with the pentapeptidyl-thioester and the decapeptidyl-thioester revealed similar rates of product formation. In contrast, GrsB TEShort catalyzes a 5-fold slower product formation. Due to good solubility and the best yields of the GrsB PCP-TE, all further experiments were conducted with this construct.",

Therefore, the major question for excised GrsB PCP-TE was whether the recombinant protein is able to catalyze an iterative reaction in vitro. For this purpose, we synthesized the native pentapeptidyl-SNAC and -thiophenol substrates, GS5SNAC, GS5SPh (Table 1), respectively, and incubated them with the GrsB PCP-TE. In both cases, the HPLC trace revealed that GrsB PCP-TE catalyzes the dimerization of the pentapeptides to a decapeptide and its subsequent cyclization, resulting in the formation of gramicidin S (tR = 43.1) (Figures 3B and 3C). The formation of gramicidin S in this reaction occurred with a kcat value of 0.4 min\u22121 for GS5SNAC and a kcat value of 2.4 min\u22121 for GS5SPh. Taking into account that the linear gramicidin substrate possesses two nucleophiles, l-Orn4 and the N terminus of d-Phe1, MS-MS sequencing of the cyclic decapeptide was conducted. The results obtained excluded the possibility that l-Orn4 is involved in ring formation. Cyclization is exclusively mediated through a nucleophilic attack of the \u03b1 amino group of d-Phe1; fragment ions proving the predicted linkage of d-Phe1 to l-Leu5 were unambiguously identified (Figure S2). In addition to the main product, gramicidin S, and hydrolysis of the pentamer, linear decapeptidyl-SNAC (5+5) and a 15-membered ring (5+5+5) (at low concentrations) consisting of three pentapeptide monomers were detected as side products (ratio hydrolysis/gramicidin S: 1/4). In the case of GS5SPh, such a linear decepeptidyl intermediate was not observed (ratio hydrolysis/gramicidin S: 1/3). Interestingly, GS5SPh forms a 5-membered ring in an enzyme-independent reaction, which is not observed with the SNAC-activated substrate. Comparison of the assay conducted with and without enzyme showed that the enzyme-catalyzed reaction is faster than the uncatalyzed formation of the 5-membered ring. For stability reasons, we used peptidyl-SNACs instead of thiophenols for all further studies.",

For this purpose, single amino acid residues in the native pentapeptide substrate were exchanged stepwise for alanine and were screened for the formation of the corresponding decapeptides. Substrates substituted in positions 2 (l-Pro2), 3 (l-Val3), and 4 (l-Orn4) revealed the formation of a 10-membered ring with the corresponding linear SNAC intermediate and small amounts of the 15-membered ring, indicating the tolerance of GrsB PCP-TE for those positions within the pentapeptide (\nTable 1, Table 2, the ratio of hydrolysis/linear and cyclic products is: GS5SNAC, 1/4; GS5Ala2, 1/2.5; GS5Ala3, 6/1; GS5Ala4, 1/1.5). The velocity of the reaction was about the same for the tested substrates (conversion of substrate after 10 min: GS5SNAC, 11%; GS5Ala2, 6%; GS5Ala3, 9%; GS5Ala4, 9%). Interestingly, in the assays with the alanine pentapeptide derivatives, the ratio of the 15-membered ring to the 10-membered ring is different (ratio 10-membered ring/15-membered ring: GS5SNAC, 6/1; GS5Ala2, 5/1; GS5Ala3, 2/1; GS5Ala4, n.d.). To corroborate these results, we determined the kinetic parameters for the cyclization reaction of the corresponding SNAC decapeptides GS10Ala2,7, GS10Ala3,8, and GS10Ala4,9 (Table 1, Table 2; GS10Ala2,7: KM, 357 \u03bcM, kcat, 4 min\u22121; GS10Ala3,8: KM, 485 \u03bcM, kcat, 3.4 min\u22121). Unfortunatley, we had solubility problems with GS10Ala4,9; thus, we were not able to determine kinetic parameters. Additionally, we altered the configuration of the amino acids at positions 1 and 5. Substrates carrying d-Leu at the C terminus (GS5\nd\n-Leu5 and GS10\nd\n-Leu10) showed low hydrolysis rates, whereas substrates carrying l-Phe at the N terminus (GS5\nl\n-Phe1 and GS10\nl\n-Phe1) were mainly hydrolyzed.

Starting by assaying the smallest dipeptide, GS2 (Table 1), only hydrolysis could be detected. In addition, the slow formation of diketopiperazin as a prominent nonenzymatic reaction was visible. These results indicate that the dipeptide GS2 seems to be too short for the conversion catalyzed by the thioesterase. By using additional substrates of varying lengths it was possible to detect, in addition to hydrolysis, the formation of different ring sizes. The tripeptide GS3 (Table 1, Table 2) was dimerized by the thioesterase and was subsequently cyclized into a 6-membered ring (3+3) as the single product. Consecutively, we incubated a tetrapeptide, GS4 (Table 1), with GrsB PCP-TE. After 90 min of incubation, one-third of this tetrapeptide was converted into two products, an 8-membered (48%, 4+4) and a 12-membered (21%, 4+4+4) ring (Table 2).

As iterative TE domains mediate the linkage of smaller monomers before cyclization, the question of whether the excised GrsB PCP-TE can potentially act as a ligase arises. To test this ability, we had to impede the GrsB PCP-TE from acting as a cyclase. This was achieved by blocking either the N or C terminus of the suitable linear monomers. In a first set of experiments, we incubated GrsB PCP-TE with a pentapeptide, GS5OH, that was not activated as a thioester. As expected, no conversion was detectable. Additionally, an activated pentapeptidyl-SNAC, GS5NAc, that was N-terminally acylated, was constructed. Assaying this substrate with GrsB PCP-TE resulted exclusively in hydrolysis, whereas coincubation of both substrates, GS5OH and GS5NAc, led to the ligation of these pentapeptides, which, in turn, resulted in a linear decapeptide (ratio ligation/hydrolysis: 1/2, using 300 \u03bcM of each substrate). This reaction clearly indicated the ability of GrsB PCP-TE to catalyze a ligation reaction. Following Michaelis-Menten kinetics, this ligation reaction was determined to a kcat of 4.9 min\u22121 and a KM of 0.62 mM for GS5OH and a kcat of 7.3 min\u22121 and a KM of 1.1 mM for GS5NAc.",

Former studies with the same pentapeptidyl-SNAC indicated a barely detectable dimerization activity catalyzed by GrsB TE [7]. In contrast, our results prove not only dimerization, but also subsequent cyclization, resulting in gramicidin S in sufficient yields for thiophenol- and SNAC-activated substrates. Dimerization activity by TE domains of linear NRPSs has been described only once thus far [13]. Here, the gramicidin S pentapeptidyl-SNAC was used in combination with the excised tyrocidine TE, leading to hydrolysis as the major product and small amounts of dimerized and cyclized products. In comparison, dimerization and cyclization catalyzed by GrsB PCP-TE is indeed slower, but they are only accompanied by low rates of hydrolysis (ratio cycle(5+5)/hydrolysis 4/1 for GS5SNAC). Kinetic investigations show that the conversion of the pentapeptide into gramicidin S is slower than the conversion of the decapeptide, possibly due to the fact that the ligation reaction of the pentapeptide is the rate-determining step. Using the pentapeptidyl-SNAC as the substrate, a decapeptidyl-SNAC was generated in an enzyme-dependent reaction. The detection of this decapeptidyl-SNAC gave rise to speculations about the mechanism of iterative TE domains. The SNAC intermediate can be formed by the nucleophilic attack of the amino group of a free SNAC pentapeptide on the peptidylester of the TE-bound pentapeptide. If the free amino group of the TE-bound substrate would attack the thioester of the SNAC-activated peptide, only hydrolyzed linear substrates could be detected as side products. These observations can also aid in the understanding of the reaction catalyzed by iterative thioesterases in vivo. For the enterobactin synthetase, Shaw-Reid et al. [15] postulated that the first monomer is built up by the synthetase and is subsequently transferred to the active site serine of the TE domain. The second monomer is presented by the pan-arm of the PCP domain adjacent to Ent-TE. The ligation reaction results in a dimer bound as an ester to the active site serine of the TE domain. Two possible mechanisms for this elongation reaction can be postulated (\nFigure 5). Either the amino group of the first monomer bound to the TE domain nucleophilicaly attacks the second monomer presented by the pan-PCP, resulting in a dimer bound to the active site serine of the TE domain (forward reaction), or the amino group of the PCP-bound substrate attacks the TE-bound monomer, resulting in a dimer bound to the PCP domain, that is subsequently transferred to the active site serine of the TE domain for cyclization (backward reaction). According to our results, there is strong evidence that the GrsB TE utilizes the backward reaction, as we were able to detect the formation of the decapeptidyl-SNAC. To date, it cannot be verified whether the decapeptidyl-SNAC is a side product or an intermediate of the reaction. In the forward reaction, a second catalytic center would be required to catalyze the ligation reaction because the serine of the catalytic triad is blocked by the first monomer. Comprehensive sequence alignments of several TE domains revealed that the gramicidin TE domain has an extension of about 25 amino acids (Figure 2). Expression of this longer version of the GrsB TE domain (GrsB TELong) published by Kohli et al. [7], and a short version (GrsB TEShort) missing the 25 amino acids resulted in comparable dimerization and cyclization activity. Although the obtained products were found in equal parts, the catalytic efficiency of GrsB TEShort is 5-fold lower, indicating an important role of the N-terminal extension for protein stability. Also, the iterative gramicidin TE domain has a longer linker region between the PCP and the TE domain that was not observed in other PCP-TE junctions. This extended linker region may be important for flexibility of the thioesterase needed to catalyze two different reactions: the ligation of two substrates and intramolecular cyclization. Structural analysis of this iterative TE might provide insights into these mechanistic issues.",

Encouraged by these results, we propose that the pre-fold of the substrate might be important for the efficiency of the catalytic reaction. The impact of the substrate pre-fold was also shown for the thioesterase excised from the tyrocydine synthetase, whose cyclization potential depends on the pre-fold of the linear substrate that is used [27].

The heptapeptide GS7 is elongated once, and subsequent cyclization led to a 14-membered ring. The 14-membered ring likewise has a stabilized \u03b2 sheet structure that is preferred to an unstabilized 7-membered ring. This indicates that the elongation and subsequent cyclization to an energetically favored ring size is preferred by GrsB PCP-TE. Larger peptides containing more than seven amino acids were exclusively cyclized. Although the larger 18-membered ring is believed to have a \u03b2 sheet structure, this cyclization was not observed when the TE domain was incubated with the nonapeptide GS9; instead, a 9-membered ring was exclusively formed. This can be explained by the maximum capacity of the catalytic pocket of the thioesterase. GrsB PCP-TE can sufficiently cyclize linear peptides consisting of 6\u201315 amino acids, reflecting the high variability, flexibility, and limitation of the binding pocket. For the tetrapeptide GS4, an 8-membered (4+4) and 12-membered (4+4+4) ring were observed. These products are not in accordance with the \u03b2 sheet rule.

Here, we present a comprehensive in vitro characterization of the excised iterative, bimodular PCP-TE of the gramicidin S synthetase GrsB. We show that the TE domain catalyzes the ligation and subsequent cyclization of peptidyl-SNAC and -thiophenols. Detection of linear thioester intermediates supports a mechanism in vivo, in which the ligation product of the two pentapeptides is transferred backward to the PCP domain to be cyclized by the TE domain afterwards (backward reaction).
