The proportion of confirmed to suspected cases varied from 0.5 in the initial days to 3.9 in the peak days. Early detection helped Korea eliminate the infection from the community and restrict it to health facilities, which is an essential aspect of outbreak response. Also, research teams started their work in the very early days to develop rapid tests, treatments, and vaccines. From January 31 onward, the 6-hour test was distributed in some health facilities, and from February 7 onward, all health facilities all around the country had this test. 10 Moreover, the KCDC started reporting the situation from January 20 onward to provide accurate and real-time data. These reports included the number of confirmed cases and patients under investigation, history of confirmed cases, and prevention advice for the public. The number of the KCDC call center has been mentioned in almost every report, and Koreans were asked not to travel to China and Wuhan, to avoid public outdoor activities, to cough or sneeze safely, and to wear masks when visiting a health center. Besides, the guideline for management and screening get updated whenever needed; travel to Wuhan which was in the definition of suspected cases where changed to travel to china, and finally omitted. 10 Altogether, the main goal of outbreak response in Korea was prevention of entrance of COVID-19 and at the same time, inhibition of the spread of the virus throughout the country. These goals were achieved through 3 main strategies: (1) containment and mitigation based on outbreak situation; (2) Risk communication to attract community participation; and (3) science-based and factdriven actions.",
