Early approaches to deal with it were mainly based on the alignment of a gene or protein sequence. But on one hand, \u201cdifferent genes may tell different stories\u201d\u2014unequal mutational rates of different genes or different pieces of genes and lateral gene transfer are widely detected, so a single gene or protein sequence usually does not have enough information to determine its phylogenetic position. On the other hand, traditional alignment methods are computationally intensive and meaningless to whole genome comparison because each genome has its own genes and gene order. In a word, there is an urgent need to develop new phylogenetic methods utilizing the ever-increasing genome data.",

Among the earliest attempts is the gene content method [1], [2], which utilizes the ratio between the number of genes two species share and the total number of genes. This method is very simple and can be applied to long genomes. But it fails when species are closely related to each other, e.g., mt genome sequences of some placental mammals used by Cao et al. [3]. Because these genomes share exactly the same genes and gene order. Similar work along this line is the gene order method [4], which also fails in the above case. Besides, some methods based on graphical representations of DNA sequences are outlined [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], which usually translate a DNA sequence to a set of plots in 2D/3D space, and use some graphical invariants to characterize this sequence. These methods provide a simple way of viewing, sorting and comparing various gene structures.",

Observing that relative abundances of all dinucleotide are remarkably constant across the genome, Karlin et al. [11], [12], [13] proposed the genome signature to characterize this genome. The genome signature consists of the array of dinucleotide relative abundances \u03c1xy=fxy/fxfy extended over all dinucleotides, where fx is the frequency of nucleotide x and fxy is the frequency of dinucleotide xy. Alternatively, relative abundance of tri-, tetra- or even k-nucleotides can also be calculated. Besides phylogenetic inference, these signatures have been used in several applications, e.g., assessment of general relatedness of genomes [12], genetic sequence classification [16], clustering of genes from different genomes [17], and recognition of species-specific sequence blocks [18].",

Let pAi and pBi be the observed frequencies of the i-th k-nucleotide in sequences A and B, respectively. The relative entropy (or Kullback\u2013Leibler distance) [19] is defined as(1)RE(A,B)=\u2211ipAilog2pAipBi.The relative entropy is the inefficiency of assuming that the distribution is pB when the true distribution is pA. It does not satisfy the symmetry condition and the triangle inequality, so it is not strictly a distance measure. The relative entropy, however, satisfies many important and useful mathematical properties. For example, it is a convex function of pAi, always nonnegative, and vanishes if and only if pAi=pBi for all possible i.",

As a revision of the classical relative entropy, this metric works equivalently to the relative entropy in phylogenetic inference when k is small, and avoids the degeneration in the case of large k.

But an obvious default in this tree is that it fails to cluster the three group I coronaviruses: HCoV-229E, PEDV and TGEV. Fig. 4 lists the phylogenetic tree constructed by dCOS. This topology supports SARS-CoVs and group II as a closer pair, which is in accordance with the result of Li\u00f2 and Goldman using a fragment of the spike protein [26]. However, this tree also fails to cluster the group I coronaviruses. In Fig. 5, we list the tree built by linear correlation coefficient between pairwise frequency vectors. This tree perfectly clusters species within each typical group, and supports the outgroup status of SARS-CoVs relative to other coronaviruses.

It has relatively low computational complexity, and does not suffer from genetic rearrangements and transposon activity, which serve as common ways of genome evolution. In most cases, biological sequences are represented as occurrence or composition vectors in a high dimensional Euclidean space, and phylogenetic results are high reliable on the quality of this vector representation. In order to capture more sequence information and obtain a better vector representation, the suitable word length is of critical importance. According to the information theory, this length reflects the balance between noise and information\u2014some information may be lost if one uses overshort words, while noise will dominate when long words are considered. Moreover, suitable length of word is often species-specific. In a word, a well-defined distance measure which can be applied to any word length is of great importance.",

However, as word order increases, this approach will get degenerate results due to the absent of some word types. In the present paper, we propose three revisions of the classical relative entropy (RE). These modifications perform equally with RE in phylogenetic inferences in the case of short words. But when long words are considered, our method still works and gets convergent phylogenetic topologies (in such case, RE gets degenerate results as some word types are absent). Through constructing phylogenetic trees using WSE and some classical distance measures, we find that, as far as the set of 25 virus sequences is concerned, our distances are not inferior to those classical methods. According to our tree, all SARS-CoVs form a group, which is more related to the group I coronavirus: TGEV. This result is mainly in accordance with the phylogeny given by Yang et al. [27], and is also supported by the experimental evidence, which showed that group I coronaviruses (transmissible gastroenteritis virus, TGEV) specific antibodies are able to recognize antigens in SARS-CoV infected cultured cells [37]. We hope our modification can be served as an alternative approach to avoid the degeneracy, and has potential to study information expressed by different orders of words (when RE-based approaches are used).",

Then performance of different WSE can be evaluated by checking the consistency of these phylogenetic topologies. Theoretically, we hypothesize that order relations between pairwise sequence distances calculated by RE and WSE are in accordance, i.e., WSE\n(A,B)<\nWSE\n(C,D) if and only if RE(A,B)<RE(C,D), for any sequences A, B, C and D (proof will be presented in our future paper).
