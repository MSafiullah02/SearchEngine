A comprehensive search from Chinese and worldwide official websites and announcements was performed between 1 December 2019 and 9:30 AM 26 January 2020 (Beijing time). A latest summary of 2019-nCoV and the current outbreak was drawn. Up to 24 PM, 25 January 2020, a total of 1975 cases of 2019-nCoV infection were confirmed in mainland China with a total of 56 deaths having occurred. The latest mortality was approximately 2.84% with a total of 2684 cases still suspected. The China National Health Commission reported the details of the first 17 deaths up to 24 PM, 22 January 2020. The deaths included 13 males and 4 females. The median age of the people who died was 75 (range 48-89) years. Fever (64.7%) and cough (52.9%) were the most common first symptoms among those who died. The median number of days from the occurence of the first symptom to death was 14.0 (range 6-41) days, and it tended to be shorter among people aged 70 years or more (11.5 [range 6-19] days) than those aged less than 70 years (20 [range 10-41] days; P = .033). The 2019-nCoV infection is spreading and its incidence is increasing nationwide. The first deaths occurred mostly in elderly people, among whom the disease might progress faster. The public should still be cautious in dealing with the virus and pay more attention to protecting the elderly people from the virus. K E Y W O R D S coronavirus, epidemiology, infection",

Another possible reason for the fast spreading would be the Spring Festival travel rush, in which thousands of millions of people were on the move heading home and the virus would definitely spread quickly, especially with those coming out from Wuhan. Our study also demonstrated that the 2019-nCoV had caused a total 1975 infections and 56 deaths in 26 days since the first official announcement. 1 The current mortality of the 2019-nCoV is approximately 2.84%, which is lower than that of 9.6% of the SARS-CoV that spread globally to 30 countries/regions, infected 8098 people, and killed 774 patients from November 2002 to July 2003, 25 and lower than that of 34.4% of the MERS-CoV, which spread globally to 27 countries/regions, infected 2494 people and killed 858 patients from September 2012 to September 2019. 26 However, in the first 3 months from November 2002 to February 2003, 27 Guangdong, China, had only witnessed a diagnosis of the atypical pneumonia initially considered chlamydia pneumoniae (later confirmed to be caused by SARS) in 305 cases with 5 deaths. Taken together, these facts show that although the current mortality is lower than that of the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV, it seems that the 2019-nCoV is very contagious.
