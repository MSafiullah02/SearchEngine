The genes for the structural proteins, including a capsid protein C and two glycoproteins, are encoded at the 5 end of the genome, whereas the genes for the NS proteins are 3 .

The folding of the glycoprotein must accommodate the location of structure features of the protein and cysteine bonding. Cysteines are usually the most conserved amino acids within a protein family because disulfide linkages are a critical determinant of secondary structure. With the exception of the last cysteine in each of the Jingmen flavi-like virus glycoproteins the cysteines are conserved (Figure 2) . Overall, the length and co-linearity of putative fusion loops, class III domains, stem domains (when present) and TM anchors are consistent with the suggestion that Jingmen flavi-like viruses encode modified class II fusion proteins. There are many possible alternatives to the cysteine linkages and secondary structures shown. However, plausible models that conform to the scaffold of the known structure class II VFP can be constructed based on the Jingmen flavi-like virus sequences (Figures 3-5) . After scaffolding on YFV E structure (Figure 3 ), the models for ALSV VP1a (Figure 4 ) and JMTV VP1 ( Figure 5 ) place predicted structures such as the fusion peptides in appropriate domains.

The models also place cysteine residues in close proximity with possible linkages occurring within the three domains, while conforming to the structural predictions of PredictProtein. Class II fusion proteins of members of the Flavivirus genus are present on the surface of mature virions as homodimers. Current models of fusion class II viral fusion proteins suggest that exposure to the low pH of the endosome triggers trimerization and a bending of class II fusion proteins at a flexible \"hinge\" region between domains I and II, elevating the fusion peptide so that it can insert into the host membrane [56, 57] . A rearrangement of the stem (pre-anchor region), so that there are more extensive interactions with domains I-III, results in a deformation of the viral and target membranes. Subsequently, the membranes are brought closer together by continued interactions of the stem with domains I-III, which results in bilayer hemifusion [58, 59] . The formation of the final post-fusion trimer accompanies complete fusion of the viral and cellular membrane allowing entry of the ribonucleoproteins containing the viral genomic RNA. To examine whether the class II structure of the Jingmen flavi-like viruses could accommodate similar rearrangements, we constructed space-filling models of Jingmen flavi-like virus glycoproteins in dimer and trimer configurations ( Figure 6 ). Mucin-like domains would be exposed on the surface of the proteins. The N-terminal mucin-like domain of both ALSV and JMTV potentially sits on top of the dimer. The mucin-like domain found on the leash of ALSV would be able to occupy the space between the dimers on the virion. The rearrangement of ALSV from a dimer to a trimer could occur with the leash occupying the same groove formed between monomers of the trimer as occupied in the post-fusion form of class II flavivirus E. Likewise, the stem of JMTV VP1 could occupy the same grove occupied by the stem of YFV E in the post-fusion configuration.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2472, "end": 2476, "text": "[56,", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2477, "end": 2480, "text": "57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 2808, "end": 2812, "text": "[58,", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 2813, "end": 2816, "text": "59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 635, "end": 645, "text": "(Figure 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}, {"start": 1134, "end": 1147, "text": "(Figures 3-5)", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}, {"start": 1187, "end": 1196, "text": "(Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}, {"start": 1225, "end": 1234, "text": "(Figure 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 1252, "end": 1260, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF12"}, {"start": 1658, "end": 1671, "text": "(Figures 3-5)", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}, {"start": 1711, "end": 1721, "text": "(Figure 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}, {"start": 1749, "end": 1758, "text": "(Figure 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 1776, "end": 1784, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF12"}, {"start": 3236, "end": 3244, "text": "Figure 6", "ref_id": "FIGREF15"}], "section": "Jingmen Flavi-Like Virus Glycoprotein Models"}, {"text": "Immature virions of members of the Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae contain a precursor prM to the small membrane protein M [60] .
