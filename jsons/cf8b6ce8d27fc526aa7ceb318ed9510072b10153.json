            "text": "Historically, BCG, a weakened strain of Mycobacterium bovis, has been used as a vaccine against tuberculosis. The vaccination is given to children in their first year of life in most countries across the world. The protection against active tuberculosis is variable among different countries and studies, but is estimated to be approximately 60% [1] . Vaccinations have been considered to function mechanistically by imitating pathogens, leading to an expansion of \"memory\" T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes that can combat future exposures. It has been thought that the innate immune system, compromising macrophages, natural killer cells, neutrophils, and other white blood cells, had no such memory to help combat future attacks. This hypothesis has been put to the test using BCG vaccination. Although nonspecific effects of BCG were suspected back in the 1970s [2] , more recent work by Netea and colleagues [3] [4] [5] using BCG have shown that the innate immune system can develop \"memory\", which is termed trained immunity, through epigenetic reprogramming of different innate immune cell types. In both human and murine models they have shown that BCG vaccination can lead to trained immunity, which helps eliminate various non-mycobacterium infections including staphylococci, candidiasis, yellow fever, and influenza. The innate immune system and trained immunity can be considered in the fight against bladder cancer, but more importantly in the fight against viruses including COVID-19 [6] . A small randomized study by Leentjens et al [7] showed that BCG vaccination before influenza vaccination in healthy individuals resulted in a significantly more pronounced antibody response against influenza A (H1N1) compared to placebo. These findings are the basis for the initiation of BCG vaccination trials to fight infections such as COVID-19. There are trials under way studying the effect of BCG vaccination to increase resistance to infections in the elderly population and to try and help prevent severe COVID-19 infection in health care workers.",

To date, there are no reports that patients receiving intravesical BCG have a higher risk of contracting COVID-19. For induction therapy, US experts suggested that if a patient has had four doses, it is possible to wait a few weeks before receiving the remaining doses. The risk of contracting the virus when coming to a health care facility for this treatment is higher than any risk of delaying doses five and six for several weeks. If a patient is still on the third dose, the fourth dose should be given before delaying the remaining treatments. If patients are on maintenance therapy, receiving doses one and two and skipping dose three completely is acceptable [11] .",

Diverse solutions have been proposed [15] [16] [17] . A recent report published in European Urology Oncology is of utmost interest because of the possible implications in this scenario. In an in vitro study, Brooks and coworkers [18] assessed the viability of the TICE strain of BCG in terms of colony-forming units and demonstrated that viability remains constant for at least 8 h after reconstitution. While the viability at 24 h was lower, it did not decrease to a level below that of a one-third does of BCG and remained close to Y X X X ( 2 0 1 9 ) X X X -X X X 50% for at least 72 h.
