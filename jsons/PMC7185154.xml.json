Viral infection begins with an initial attachment step, namely the binding of the virus to the respective host cell receptor. SARS-CoV has been studied since the outbreak in 2002. It is well known that the virus enters cells through the binding of its spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2). Although the 2019-nCoV RBD has not yet been fully investigated, it shares same common characteristics with SARS-CoV and it has the ability to bind to human ACE2 (6). ACE2 receptors exist in a number of animals and this is the reason why inter-species contamination is possible. The efficiency of this binding depends on the affinity between the RBD of the virus and the species-specific ACE2. Although it is already known that rats and mice are not susceptible, the issue of Covid-19 RBD recognition of ACE2 of dogs remains unresolved.",

It is believed that dog's infection was possibly due to transmission from his infected owner (a human-to-animal transmission). The dog remained under quarantine and samples taken on February 28 and on March 2, were again weak positive, confirming the case of infection (instead of just mouth and nose contamination from the household). The dog was asymptomatic during the whole period of infection. The AFCD of Hong Kong stated: \u2018Although there is no evidence yet that pets can transmit the virus to other pets or back to humans, we strongly advise that mammalian pets including dogs and cats from households with persons confirmed as infected with COVID-19 or as close contacts of COVID-19 infected persons should be put under quarantine in AFCD facilities to safeguard public and animal health. We will review this arrangement from time to time taking into account new information that becomes available\u2019 (7).",

The dog was 17 years old and had ongoing health issues that were likely responsible for the death of this dog, rather than COVID-19. We are told the second pet dog has been released from quarantine. On March 19, the AFCD reported that a third dog, a German Shepherd Dog living with an owner testing positive for COVID-19, had also tested positive. Another mixed-breed dog from the same residence tested negative. Neither dog has shown signs of disease.

Dr Rankin mentioned: \u2018It was a single case, and we learned that we need to do a lot more research into the potential of the human SARS-CoV-19 virus to infect animals. That said, cats and dogs are mammals too. They have many of the same types of receptors on their cells that we do. So the virus could theoretically attach to these receptors. But will it enter their cells and replicate? Probably not. Still, people infected with SARS-CoV-19 should limit contact with their pets. Wash your hands, and don't let them lick you on the face. If the virus is in your secretions, and there's any potential of transmission, these are ways it could be transmitted\u2019. Speaking for the need of testing pets she said: \u2018That's [not] everybody's top priority right now. It should be discussed, however, if we start seeing more cases like the Hong Kong Pomeranian\u2019. Responding in the question if pets can serve as a reservoir of the virus and pass it back to us she responded that \u2018If pets can become infected - and we don't know if they can - then yes, they could serve as a reservoir. And in that case, we'd need to deal with them the same way we're dealing with human cases. We'd need to figure how to treat them. Like human hospitals, vet hospitals would have to be prepared for a surge in the number of cases\u2019 (11).",
