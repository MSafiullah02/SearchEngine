Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the filovirus glycoprotein (GP) are among the most promising countermeasures for filoviruses (Zeitlin et al., 2016). Several studies have shown the superiority of specific combinations of mAbs targeting different EBOV GP epitopes compared to monotherapy (Olinger et al., 2012; Pettitt et al., 2013; Qiu et al., 2012a, 2012b, 2014). The combination of antibody therapy with adenovirus-expressed interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 in nonhuman primates (NHPs) also resulted in enhanced efficacy (Qiu et al., 2013). While these studies focused on EBOV-specific therapies, we recently targeted other ebolaviruses and demonstrated improved neutralization efficacy by combining several pan-ebo-lavirus therapeutic mAbs (Holtsberg et al., 2015; Howell et al., 2016; Keck et al., 2015). These findings indicate that the engagement of multiple antibodies through different protective mechanisms can be highly effective in controlling filovirus infection.",

            "text": "The filovirus surface glycoproteins (GPs) consist of disulfide-linked subunits GP1 and GP2. The crystal structure of EBOV GP in complex with the neutralizing mAb KZ52 showed that three GP1 subunits assemble in a chalice-like structure surrounded by three GP2 subunits, which, with an N-terminal portion of GP1, form the base of the chalice (Lee et al., 2008) and anchor GP to the virus membrane. The endosomal receptor binding site (RBS) is positioned at the apex of the GP1 core and is largely concealed by a glycan cap at the rim of the chalice and by the highly glycosylated and disordered mucin-like domain (MLD). The best-characterized neutralizing epitope within EBOV GP is the so-called \u2018\u2018base epitope\u2019\u2019 consisting of residues within GP1 and GP2 and recognized by mAbs KZ52 (Davidson et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2008) and by the ZMapp therapeutic mAb cocktail components 2G4 and 4G7 (Davidson et al., 2015; Murin et al., 2014; Pallesen et al., 2016; Tran et al., 2016). Recently, we and others have identified a number of neutralizing epitopes within the RBS (Flyak et al., 2015; Howell et al., 2016; Misasi et al., 2016), the glycan cap (Bornholdt et al., 2016; Flyak et al., 2016; Holtsberg et al., 2015), and the internal fusion loop (Bornholdt et al., 2016; Misasi et al., 2016).",

In all examples, synergy was observed between two or more antibodies that could each neutralize the virus independently. Here, we describe a novel phenomenon of cooperative neutralization by mAb pairs consisting of a neutralizing mAb and a non-neutralizing mAb. We identified several such pairs by screening a panel of mAbs for binding to ebolavirus glycopro-teins and for their ability to neutralize one or more ebolaviruses. We observed neutralization by weakly or moderately neutralizing mAbs that was enhanced when they were paired with specific non-neutralizing mAbs targeting epitopes within the glycan cap of ebolavirus GP. We also found that an otherwise non-neutral-izing pan-ebolavirus mAb acquired neutralizing activity in the presence of sub-neutralizing concentrations of a mAb that bound to an adjacent epitope. Finally, we demonstrated that cooperative activity extended to protection in vivo, as a pair of mAbs that were individually non-protective, provided full protection against EBOV infection when combined in a cocktail.",

ELISA plates coated with EBOV GP were pre-incubated with saturating concentrations of individual EBOV-specific mAbs, pan-ebolavirus mAbs (Holtsberg et al., 2015; Keck et al., 2015), or a non-binding, negative control mAb. The test mAbs (bio-tinylated or having a mouse Fc region) were then added at their EC50 concentrations, and relative binding was determined. We noted competition between mAbs with closely located epitopes (Table S1), for example, mAbs 13C6 and FVM04, as we have described (Keck et al., 2015), and among the GP base-binding mAbs 2G4, 4G7, and KZ52, consistent with previous reports (Murin et al., 2014). Interestingly, this study revealed that pre-incubation with the macaque-derived mAb FVM09 enhanced the binding of m8C4 and m2G4, by 99% and 41%, respectively, but decreased binding of KZ52. In addition, FVM20, whose epitope overlaps with that of FVM09 (Keck et al., 2015), also enhanced m8C4 and m2G4 binding, by 71% and 29%. When 2G4 or 4G7 was bound first to GP, the binding of FVM20 was enhanced nearly 400%.",

Binding of 13C6 to SUDV was enhanced by FVM09 and FVM20 (by 55% and 29%, respectively; Table S2). We then tested the binding enhancement over a full range of mAb concentrations. The binding of m8C4 to EBOV GP was strongly increased in the presence of a saturating concentration of FVM09, as was the binding of FVM09 in the presence of a saturating concentration of m8C4 (4- and 2.5-fold reduction of EC50, respectively) (Figures 1A and 1B). A similar, but lesser, increase in binding was observed for m2G4 with EBOV GP in the presence of FVM09 (2-fold reduction of EC50; Figure 1C), but not for binding of 4G7 (Figure 1D). The binding of m8C4 to SUDV GP was enhanced >2-fold in presence of FVM09 (Figure 1E), and an enhancement of the weak binding of m13C6 to SUDV GP was observed (Figure 1F). FVM09 also slightly enhanced the binding of m8C4 to BDBV GP (Figure 1G) but not RESTV GP (Figure 1H).

MAbs m8C4, FVM04, KZ52, m2G4, or m4G7 were applied at their respective EC50 concentrations, and their ability to neutralize was determined in the absence or presence of individual non-neutralizing antibodies at saturating concentrations.

The CI provides a quantitative measure for additive effects (CI = 1), synergism (CI < 1), and antagonism (CI > 1). The DRI provides a measure of the potential fold dose reduction that can be achieved by drug combinations. CI and DRI values were calculated for EBOV neutralization over the full range of mAb concentrations (Figure S1) along with the values for 50% and 90% neutralization (fraction affected [Fa] 50 and Fa 90) (Figure 3I). This analysis revealed an extremely high degree of synergy between mAb pairs m8C4/FVM09, FVM09/m8C4, and FVM09/2G4, where the first mAb in each pair was tested at various concentrations, while the second was kept at a constant concentration (Figures S1A\u2013S1C). The concentration-dependent CI values for m8C4/FVM09, FVM09/m8C4, and FVM09/2G4 ranged from 0.007 to 0.12, 0.012 to 1.7, and 0.13 to 1.1, and the DRI values ranged from 8 to 145, 0.5 to 84, and 0.6 to 10, respectively (Figures S1A\u2013S1C). For SUDV neutralization, the degree of synergy between m8C4 and FVM09 was marginal (CI close to 1; Figure S1D), while clear synergy was evident when 16F6 and FVM09 were combined (CI as low as 0.1; Figures S1E and S1F). For the m8C4/FVM09 pair, analysis confirmed a synergistic neutralization of live EBOV (CI values as low as 0.0001 and DRI values as high as 56; Figure S1G) but only marginal neutralization enhancement of live SUDV (CI values mostly around 1 and DRI values between 1 and 3; Figure S1H). We also tested for synergy between FVM04 with FVM09 or FVM02 and found that the combination of FVM04/FVM09 exhibited marginal synergy (CI, 0.47\u20130.6; DRI, 1.5\u20132) and only at higher concentrations (Figures S2A\u2013S2C). However, FVM02/FVM04 did result in synergy, which was more evident at lower concentrations (CI, 0.05\u20130.5 and DRI, 35\u20132 for FVM04 concentrations of 0.05\u20135 \u03bcg/mL; Figures S2D\u2013S2F).",

Alanine substitutions at these residues reduced m8C4 binding to 2.5%, 12.9%, and 25.3% of wild-type, respectively, suggesting that these residues constitute key contact sites for m8C4 (Figure 4B). In contrast, FVM04 and FVM09 showed no reduction in binding to these mutants relative to wild-type GP; in fact, FVM09 exhibited higher binding to R136A than to wild-type GP. Similar analysis with FVM09 showed that the W288A, F290A, or W291A mutations within the b17-b18 loop essentially eliminated FVM09 binding to GP (to 0%, 6.2%, and 0% of wild-type reactivity, respectively; Figures 4C and 4D). Interestingly, the F290A and W291A loop mutations, while eliminating FVM09 binding, increased m8C4 binding by 3- to 4-fold (Figure 4F), suggesting an interaction between the two epitopes. In addition, we observed that an alanine substitution of E292, which is adjacent to the FVM09 epitope residues, increased binding of both FVM09 and m8C4 (Figure 4F). The key residues of the m8C4 epitope, Q251 and F252 within the glycan cap and R136 within the GP1 core, lie in close proximity on the outer side of GP1 and adjacent to the partially disordered b17-b18 loop (residues 279\u2013302) (Lee et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2016), which contains the FVM09 epitope (described below; Figure 4E). On the available EBOV GP structures, the b17-b18 loop partially masks the m8C4 epitope. The key contact residues for FVM09 (W288, F290, W291) and E292 are positioned at the bottom of the b17-b18 loop and interact with residues 510\u2013512, which lie between the fusion loop and the base epitope (Figure 4E), as well as with GP1 residues near the GP1/GP2 interface. Mutation of E292, which is juxtaposed to K510, may remove constraints on the b17-b18 loop and allow better interaction with FVM09. Consistent with this notion, a K510A substitution also led to increased binding of both FVM09 and m8C4 by nearly 2-fold (Figure 4G). Mutation of several other residues in this region of GP2, including the disulfide bonded cysteines C511 and C556, also significantly increased binding by both FVM09 and m8C4 (Figure 4G).",

To test this hypothesis, we generated a mutant GP with three mutations: W288A/F290A/W291A (EBOV-GP-AAA). While EBOV-GP-AAA failed to bind to FVM09, it exhibited moderately enhanced binding to m8C4 (2- to 3-fold higher than wild-type [WT] GP; Figure 5A). Despite this moderate effect of the triple mutation on m8C4 binding, a pseudotyped VSV virus incorporating the triple mutations (VSV-EBOV GP-AAA-Luc) was neutralized by m8C4 over 600-fold more effectively than wild-type VSV-EBOV GP-Luc (Figure 5B). In contrast, the triple mutation caused only a modest reduction of KZ52-mediated neutralization compared to wild-type VSV-EBOV GP-Luc (Figure 5C), indicating that the enhanced neutralization is specific to m8C4.",

The reduction (albeit modest) of KZ52 neutralization activity with VSV-EBOV GP-AAA may also be related to displacement of this loop, as it has been proposed that KZ52 makes contact with residues in the b17-b18 loop (Lee et al., 2008).",

Despite the clear Fab densities in the class averages, we were not able to obtain a 3D reconstruction, which is likely due to high flexibility of the antibodies bound to these epitopes.",

This includes triple and quadruple combinations of mAbs against gp120 and gp41 (Li et al., 1998). These mAbs were each neutralizing when used singly, and their combination led to CI values as low as 0.2 and DRI values as high as 24 for triple mAb cocktails (Li et al., 1998). Other synergistic combinations of HIV antibodies reached a CI of 0.2 and DRI of 490 in the most potent combinations (Vijh-Warrier et al., 1996). While the data presented here are reminiscent of these reported synergies among HIV antibodies, a unique aspect of our finding is the identification of non-neutralizing antibodies that convert poorly neutralizing antibodies into potent neutralizers. While FVM09 by itself has almost no EBOV neutralizing activity, its combination with the poorly neutralizing mAb m8C4 showed a 70-fold reduction in neutralization IC50, and the FVM09/m8C4 cocktail exhibited a CI as low as 0.01 and a DRI as high as 145. In the presence of sub-optimal concentrations of m8C4 or the GP base binder 2G4, FVM09 behaved as a neutralizing mAb with a saturable dose-response curve. Similarly, we showed that FVM09, which poorly neutralizes SUDV, and the non-neutralizing GP2 mAb FVM02, strongly potentiate the neutralizing activity of the SUDV-specific mAb 16F6. Because of the dramatic effect of mAb combinations (extremely high DRI and low CI) and the fact that the combination results are qualitatively different from those obtained with individual mAbs (transforming non-neutralizers to neutralizers), we refer to this phenomenon as \u2018\u2018enabling, cooperative neutralization\u2019\u2019 (i.e., effective neutralization is dependent on both mAbs while one mAb can be a non-neutralizer).",

FVM09 and FVM20 may cause a conformational change that leads to better access of m8C4 and 2G4 to their respective epitopes. Extensive interactions of the GP1 b17-b18 loop with the GP1 core and a region of GP2 close to the base epitope suggests that FVM09-like loop-binding antibodies may \u2018\u2018peel\u2019\u2019 the b17-b18 loop off from the main GP body, allowing more effective neutralization by GP base mAbs such as 2G4. Consistent with this hypothesis, our EM data suggest that this loop, when bound by FVM09, is flexible and appears to the side and above the GP trimer. This notion is also consistent with the observed competition between FVM09 and KZ52, since KZ52 appears to make contacts with the b17-b18 loop, and displacement of this loop would be expected to reduce KZ52 binding. In contrast, 2G4, which showed cooperativity with FVM09, binds to the GP base epitope at a sharper angle than KZ52 (Murin et al., 2014), which suggests that 2G4 may not contact the b17-b18 loop.",

Similarly, combining 2G4 and FVM09 resulted in only a modest binding enhancement, but the otherwise non-neutralizing FVM09 acquired a qualitatively novel property, a strong neutralizing potency similar to some of the most potent EBOV neutralizers.

It is striking that the highest degree of cooperativity was observed between mAbs with adjacent epitopes. The enhanced neutralization may result from two mAbs giving more efficient occupancy and masking of critical regions of the glycoprotein compared to that provided by a single mAb.
