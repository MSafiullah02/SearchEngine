The mechanisms that determine the age-dependent susceptibility remain largely unclear. Here, we found that the paucity of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells together with immaturity of the immune system was related to the susceptibility of neonatal mice to EV71 infection. iNKT cells were crucial antiviral effector cells to protect young mice from EV71 infection before their adaptive immune systems were fully mature. EV71 infection led to activation of iNKT cells depending on signaling through TLR3 but not other TLRs. Surprisingly, iNKT cell activation during EV71 infection required TLR3 signaling in macrophages, but not in dendritic cells (DCs). Mechanistically, interleukin (IL)-12 and endogenous CD1d-restricted antigens were both required for full activation of iNKT cells. Furthermore, CD1d-deficiency led to dramatically increased viral loads in central nervous system and more severe disease in EV71-infected mice. Altogether, our results suggest that iNKT cells may be involved in controlling EV71 infection in children when their adaptive immune systems are not fully developed, and also imply that iNKT cells might be an intervention target for treating EV71-infected patients.",

Patients with EV71 infection develop sores on the hands, feet, and sometimes buttocks and mouth, namely hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). Although many other enteroviruses cause HFMD in children, EV71 infection is more frequently associated with severe central-nervous-system complications in HFMD patients and thereby is a major cause of fatalities [1, 4] . Thus, EV71 is considered the most virulent pathogen among the HFMD-associated enteroviruses. EV71 was first isolated from a sick child in California in 1969, and EV71 outbreaks subsequently occurred in Europe in the 1970s. Currently, HFMD is a major endemic infectious disease, with over one million cases annually in China and Southeastern Asia [3, [5] [6] [7] . So far, the factors that determine the age-dependent susceptibility of children to EV71 infection remain largely unknown.",

Their finding suggests that both type I and II interferons (IFNs) are crucial in controlling EV71 infection. Both +ssRNA and -ssRNA are produced in the life cycle of EV71. The recognition of these RNA components by TLR3, TLR7, RIG-I and MDA-5 molecules expressed by host cells potentially induces type I IFN production and limits EV71 infection. Surprisingly, the production of type I IFNs is almost absent in EV71-infected cells presumably because of inhibition by 2C and 3C proteases of the virus [9] [10] [11] . Consistently, only very low levels of type I IFNs have been detected in EV71-infected mice [8] . Furthermore, a recent study by Shih's group has shown that mice deficient for interferon alpha receptor were not susceptible to EV71 infection. In contrast, mice deficient for interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) receptor were very susceptible to EV71 infection [12] . Altogether, accumulative evidences suggest that IFN-\u03b3, rather than type I IFNs, is likely important in limiting EV71 infection. Interestingly, it has been reported that severe HFMD patients with pulmonary edema have lower numbers of circulating leukocytes, including natural killer (NK) cells and T cells, in comparison to patients with mild disease [13] . Because technically the report has not distinguished NK cells from invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, it is entirely possible that iNKT cells, also IFN-\u03b3-producing cells, may also be decreased in severe patients, and could be a link to the development of the disease.",

Paget et al. demonstrated that stimulation with TLR4, TLR7, TLR8 or TLR9 ligands renders DCs capable of promoting iNKT cell activation in a self-antigen-dependent manner. In terms of TLR9 ligand (CpG)-stimulation, iNKT cell activation fully requires type I interferon or IL-12 in dependence of the types of antigen-presenting cells in the context [24, 26] . These results suggest that DNA viruses that contain CpG may trigger iNKT cell activation through the CpG-receptor TLR9. Evidently TLR9 signaling is required for iNKT cell activation in the infection by murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), a DNA virus [27, 28] . The iNKT cell activation does not require CD1d signaling but does require IL-12 production by DCs [27] . The CD1d independence and IL-12 dependence of iNKT cell activation in MCMV infection is unexpected and paradoxical to Paget's initial observation [24] and to a later finding on microbial infections [19] . The discrepancy and the opposite role of iNKT cells [17, 18] indicate that the requirement of iNKT cell activation may vary in different viral infections.",

Similar to the previous reports using C57BL/6 mice [29] , the percentages of T cells were 2-3-times less in ICR neonates on days 3 and 7 of life compared with 14-day-old mice. Similarly, the percentages of NK and NKT cells were significantly lower in the younger mice.

To determine the cellular resources of IFN-\u03b3 production after EV71 infection, we cultured splenocytes from C57BL/6 mice with EV71M and analyzed IFN-\u03b3 production in the culture supernatants. We observed that the proportion of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells increased 5-20 times upon EV71 infection compared with the controls ( Fig. 2A and S2 Fig.) . The majority of IFN-\u03b3producing cells were NK cells, but iNKT cells and NK1.1-negative cells also produced IFN-\u03b3 ( Fig. 2A) . Because NK and iNKT cells both produced IFN-\u03b3 after EV71M infection, we wondered which cells were essentially required for the IFN-\u03b3 production. RAG1-knockout mice lack NKT cells but have NK cells and other innate components. We therefore cultured RAG1knockout splenocytes with EV71M and then examined the IFN-\u03b3 production in the cultures. We found that the IFN-\u03b3 production by the splenocytes of RAG1-knockout mice was less than one quarter of wild-type mice, suggesting that the IFN-\u03b3 production of NK cells can not be primarily triggered by EV71 infection (Fig. 2B ). These observations suggest that EV71 infection primarily activates iNKT cells, and in return, presumably promotes the activation of NK cells.",

We cultured purified iNKT or NK cells together with EV71M-infected DCs or macrophages and then examined IFN-\u03b3 production in the culture supernatants. As expected, IFN-\u03b3 production was negligible in the culture supernatants of DCs, NK or iNKT cells alone. In addition, co-culture of NK cells with EV71M-infected DCs did not significantly upregulate IFN-\u03b3 production by NK cells. To our surprise, the IFN-\u03b3 production of iNKT cells was also negligible in the co-culture with EV71M-infected DCs ( Fig. 2D upper panel). In contrast, the EV71M-infected macrophages dramatically induced IFN-\u03b3 production by iNKT cells (Fig. 2D lower panel). The ability of EV71M-infected macrophages to activate iNKT cells appeared not to be linked with higher level of viral replication than DCs, as the viral titers of macrophages were not significantly different from those of DCs after EV71M infection (S4 Fig.) . Therefore, these results reveal that macrophages intrinsically possess the capability to specifically activate iNKT cells upon EV71 infection.",

To identify the potential pattern recognition receptor that recognizes EV71 and triggers activation of iNKT cells, we cultured splenocytes from WT mice or mice deficient for TLR3, TLR7 or MyD88 with or without EV71M and measured the production of IFN-\u03b3 in the supernatants of the cultures. TLR7-or MyD88-deficient splenocytes produced a similar level of IFN-\u03b3 as WT, TLR3-deficient splenocytes failed to produce IFN-\u03b3 in the presence of EV71M (Fig. 3A) . Consistently, intracellular staining of IFN-\u03b3 revealed that iNKT cells of splenocytes from TLR3-deficient mice failed to upregulate IFN-\u03b3 expression upon EV71M challenge (Fig. 3B) . Thus, these results indicate that TLR3 may be indispensable for iNKT activation in EV71M infection. To further confirm the role of TLR3 signaling in iNKT cell activation, we cultured . TLR3 is indispensable for iNKT cell activation in EV71 infection. (A) TLR3 signaling is required for IFN-\u03b3 production by EV71-infected splenocytes. Splenocytes from WT, TLR3 -/-, TLR7 -/and MyD88 -/mice (n = 3-5) were cultured with EV71M or mock for 24 hours, and IFN-\u03b3 production was quantified by ELISA. (B) TLR3 deficiency dramatically reduced the IFN-\u03b3 production of iNKT cells. Splenocytes from CD1d-deficient or WT C57BL/6 mice (n = 3) were infected with EV71M for 24 hours and then stained with TCR\u03b2, CD1d tetramer and IFN-\u03b3. Splenocytes were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin (PMA/I) or mock treated (mock), which served as positive and negative controls, respectively. IFN-\u03b3-producing cells are shown among CD1d tetramer + TCR + -gated cells. (C) iNKT cell activation in EV71 infection is dependent on TLR3 signaling. Macrophages from WT or TLR3 -/mice were cultured in the presence of EV71M for 24 hours. After extensive washing, macrophages were co-cultured for 48 hours with purified iNKT cells from WT mice, and cytokine production was quantified by ELISA. iNKT cells purified from WT mice together with EV71M-infected macrophages from TLR3deficient or WT mice and then examined the IFN-\u03b3 expression of iNKT cells. Our results revealed that TLR3-deficient macrophages failed to induce the production of IFN-\u03b3 by iNKT cells (Fig. 3C ). It has been reported that the activation of iNKT cells by pathogens in vitro does not always reflect the activation requirements in vivo [31] . We therefore examined the expression of CD69 on iNKT cells obtained from EV71M-infected mice and WT mice. We observed that CD69 expression in vivo was significantly reduced on the iNKT cells from EV71-infected, TLR3-deficient mice in comparison with WT mice (Fig. 3D) . Altogether, TLR3 expression in macrophages is indispensable for iNKT cell activation during EV71 infection.",

Likely macrophages harbor a specific capacity to activate iNKT cells upon TLR3 triggering. To address this possibility, we stimulated bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and macrophages with pI:C and then co-cultured them with purified iNKT cells. Consistent with the previous finding [24] , BMDCs stimulated with pI:C failed to upregulate IFN-\u03b3 production in iNKT cells. In contrast, macrophages stimulated with pI:C significantly upregulated the IFN-\u03b3 production of iNKT cells (Fig. 3E) .

            "text": "Because EV71 per se does not encode an enzyme to synthesize lipid ligands for activating iNKT cells, we next sought to investigate whether endogenous ligands presented by CD1d molecule are required for iNKT cell activation triggered by EV71M-infected macrophages. We found that the addition of blocking antibody against CD1d molecule significantly reduced approximately 50% of the IFN-\u03b3 production of iNKT cells co-cultured with EV71M-infected macrophages (Fig. 4A ). CD1d deficiency in macrophages also showed dramatically reduced IFN-\u03b3 production by iNKT cells (Fig. 4B ). N-(n-butyl)-deoxy-galactonojirimycin (NB-DGJ) is an inhibitor of lactase phlorizin hydrolase, which is the first enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of endogenous lipid antigens [24, 32] . We observed that the addition of NB-DGJ also significantly inhibited the IFN-\u03b3 response of iNKT cells to EV71 infection in culture (Fig. 4C) . Furthermore, we adoptively transferred purified iNKT cells into 7-day-old WT mice and CD1d -/mice and determined the CD69 expression levels of iNKT cells upon EV71M infection. We observed that CD69 expression levels were significantly upregulated on iNKT cells from WT recipient mice but not on those from CD1d -/recipient mice (Fig. 4D) . Thus, iNKT cell activation in EV71 infection requires both endogenous lipid antigen synthesis and CD1d presentation. mice (n = 3-6) were injected with 1\u00d710 5 PFU of EV71M or saline intraperitoneally. After 16 hours, splenocytes of mock (PBS) or EV71M-infected WT or TLR3 -/mice were stained with TCR\u03b2, CD1d tetramer, CD69 and DAPI. The mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of CD69 expression on iNKT cells is shown. NS, not significant; **, P<0.01. (E) TLR3 triggering in macrophages activated iNKT cells. BMDCs or macrophages were cultured with medium alone or pI:C for 24 hours and then co-cultured with purified iNKT cells from WT mice for 48 hours. Cytokine production was quantified by ELISA. All results represent the mean values of cultures of 5 mice \u00b1 SD. *, P<0.05. (F) The survival rates of 7-day-old wild-type (WT) mice and TLR3-deficient (TLR3 -/-) mice (n = 6, per group) after infection by 1\u00d710 6 It has been shown that IL-12 and IL-18 are involved in activating iNKT cells after TLR-mediated stimulation of DCs [19] [20] [21] 23, 24, 33] . To investigate the contribution of cytokines that are produced by macrophages to iNKT cell activation in response to EV71 infection, we performed experiments with blocking antibodies against IL-12 and IL-18. The presence of anti-IL-12 antibody dramatically inhibited the IFN-\u03b3 production of iNKT cells co-cultured with macrophages and EV71M compared to the isotype antibody. The IL-18-blocking antibodies did not significantly affect IFN-\u03b3 production (Fig. 4E) . Therefore, IL-12 production is required for iNKT cell activation. We next investigated the effect of TLR3 signaling on IL-12 production by macrophages in response to EV71 infection. IL-12 was measured in the culture supernatant of EV71M-infected WT or TLR3-knockout macrophages. Although significant quantities of IL-12p70 were detected in the culture supernatants of EV71M-infected WT macrophages, it was nearly undetectable in the culture supernatants of EV71M-infected TLR3-knockout macrophages (Fig. 4F) . Thus, IL-12 production by EV71-infected macrophages depends on TLR3 signaling.",

Similarly, disease development after EV71 infection only occurred in neonatal or young mice aged less than 2 weeks after adaptation [34, 35] . Older human beings and mice appear to resist EV71 infection. Currently, the factors that contribute to age-dependent resistance remain elusive. Here, we found that the age-dependent susceptibility of mice to EV71 infection was reversely associated with iNKT cell development. EV71 infection triggered iNKT cell activation in a TLR3-dependent manner. Interestingly, TLR3-triggering in macrophages, rather than in BMDCs, activated iNKT cells during EV71 infection. Both IL-12 production and endogenous CD1d ligands were required for the activation of iNKT cells triggered by EV71-infected macrophages. iNKT cells appeared to prevent the spreading of EV71 into central nervous system. Furthermore, TLR3 and CD1d-deficient young mice developed more severe disease post EV71 infection. These novel findings not only help to explain the age-dependent susceptibility of host to EV71 infection but also provide initial knowledge about how infections by RNA viruses trigger activation of iNKT cells.",

            "text": "The incapability of TLR3-mediated signaling in DCs to activate iNKT cells highlights that there is an intrinsic difference in TLR3 signaling pathways between macrophages and DCs. This merits further investigation. However, one caveat is that DCs in our and others' experiments were in vitro-cultured BMDCs. Unlike in vitro BMDCs, the DCs in lymphoid organs and other tissues of humans and mice are heterogeneous in phenotype and functionality [38] . Thus, it is impossible to exclude some subsets of DCs that may activate iNKT cells upon RNA virus infection in vivo. Furthermore, fecal-oral infection is a natural route of transmission of EV71 infection. CD1d also expresses on the intestine epithelial cells and is involved in the induction of oral tolerance and protection from mucosal infections [39] . We also observed that 75% of CD1d-knockout mice upon oral infection of EV71M developed disease and had significantly higher clinical score than WT mice, as all the wild type mice survived without any palpable symptoms after the infection (S5 Fig.) . Therefore, it is also possible that intestine epithelial cells also play a role in the mucosal immunity elicited by iNKT cells against EV71 infection. It is also of great interest to investigate the cell type-dependent activation of iNKT cells in EV71 infection as well as other viral infections in future.",

            "text": "Viruses mostly do not encode enzymes responsible for synthesizing glycolipids that bind to CD1d molecule. Our results showed that blocking CD1d-mediated antigen presentation with antibody and biosynthesis of endogenous lipid antigens in EV71-infected macrophages with an inhibitor significantly decreased the activation of iNKT cells. In addition, CD1d-deficient macrophages post EV71 infection had significantly reduced ability to activate iNKT cells compared to WT macrophages. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of purified iNKT cells also slightly but significantly prolonged the survival of EV71M-infected 3-day-old WT mice, but this protective effect did not occur in CD1d-deficient recipients (S6 Fig.) . Similarly, adoptive transfer experiment also suggested that activation of iNKT cells in vivo in EV71M infection also requires CD1d molecule (Fig. 4D) . These results all suggested that full iNKT cell activation during EV71 infection required CD1d molecule and its presentation of endogenous lipid antigens. This is in contrast to the findings showing that iNKT cell activation triggered by the infection of MCMV is not dependent on CD1d molecule [27, 28] . MCMV encodes a CD1d-like protein, m157, that can directly bind to the Ly49H molecule on NK cells and activate the NK cells iNKT Cells Foil EV71 Relying on TLR3-Triggering in Macrophages [40, 41] . Ly49H is still expressed on NK1.1-positive cells in Nfil3-deficient mice that have no NK cells but still have iNKT cells [42] , suggesting that iNKT cells may potentially express Ly49H. The potential Ly49H-m157 interaction may thus contribute to the CD1d independence of iNKT cell activation. Altogether, the discrepancy in the CD1d requirement in viral infections may support a notion that different viruses may trigger distinct pathways to activate iNKT cells.",

Graphs were produced and statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism. Fig. EV71M infection induces IFN-\u03b3 expression of iNKT cells from suckling mice in vitro. Splenocytes from 7 or 14-day-old C57BL/6 mice were infected with EV71M for 24 hours and then stained with TCR\u03b2, CD1d tetramer and IFN-\u03b3. Splenocytes that were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin (PMA/I) or mock treated (mock) served as positive and negative controls, respectively. IFN-\u03b3-producing cells are shown among CD1d tetramer + TCR\u03b2 + -gated cells. Splenocytes from more than three mice were pooled and infected in triplicate. Data are representative of two independent experiments. (TIF) Three-day-old WT (circle) or CD1d -/-(triangle) neonates were adoptively transferred with 2\u00d710 5 purified iNKT cells (filled) or vehicle control (hollow) intraperitoneally and infected with 2\u00d710 5 PFU of EV71M. Survival was monitored for the indicated period (n 3 per group). Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted using GraphPad Prism and difference between the WT mice transferred with iNKT cells group and CD1d -/transferred with iNKT cells group or PBS-injected groups was statistically significant as determined by Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon Test analysis (P < 0.05).
