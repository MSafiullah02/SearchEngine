Several reasons might explain this observation. In contrast with pioneering series, in which one physician performed the majority of the cases, two vascular surgeons in our institution performed fenestrated and branched procedures as the first operator, although a highly experienced interventional radiologist (H.K.) was present during almost all procedures. This, combined with the fact that three different types of device were used, might have contributed to IOAEs in some patients. However, more than a simple learning curve of technical skills, one could argue that our results are mainly due to suboptimal patient selection. On review of the mortalities in this series, all patients had challenging aneurysm morphology or significant comorbidity (American Society of Anesthesiologists class 4). Four patients had \u201cshaggy\u201d aortas with floating thrombus, resulting in fatal embolic complications. As FEVAR and BEVAR are being increasingly used and disseminated, the results of our initial experience confirm that they remain complex procedures that need to be centralized in high-volume centers. They also raise the question of whether encouraging results of initial series can be reproduced in the \u201creal world,\u201d knowing these series came from a very few pioneering expert centers and included highly selected patients.",

Even if most of them could be rescued with additional bailout endovascular maneuvers and without permanent damaging consequences for the patient (Table VI), they are considered avoidable. Thrombus formation in the long 7F sheaths may also have been avoided by more frequent flushing. Cannulation failure was relatively rare (n = 4) but had devastating consequences for the patient, leading directly or indirectly to severe complications or death (Table VI). This was mainly due to sizing errors, malpositioning of the fenestrated component, or difficult anatomy and occurred predominantly at the beginning of our experience.",

The patient subsequently died of meningoencephalitis after spinal drain placement for paraplegia, although the use of sac perfusion branches to reduce paraplegia risk remains controversial. With the exception of one endovascular reintervention, all remaining IOAEs relating to graft malpositioning were managed successfully without harm to the patient.",

Consequently, there was considerable heterogeneity in complexity of aneurysm morphology and difficulty of procedures, which varied from stents with two fenestrations to challenging branched stent grafting for type II TAAAs in high-risk patients. Despite these limits, this study suggests that in routine practice, technical difficulties and IOAEs during FEVAR and BEVAR procedures are not rare, particularly with difficult aneurysm morphology. It is likely that continuous improvements in endovascular and imaging technologies will improve the safety of complex endovascular aortic procedures. Development of lower profile stent grafts and bridging stents, with better visibility and repositionability, will probably play a key role in reducing IOAEs. New tools for improved catheter navigation, such as robotic navigation,21 may also facilitate target vessel cannulation. Although few data exist, fusion of images may be useful to reduce doses of contrast material and radiation.22\n",
