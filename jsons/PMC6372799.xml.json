ROs are enriched with viral replication factors and coopted host factors, and serve several important purposes in virus replication (5), including facilitating genome replication. Among picornaviruses, enteroviruses and kobuviruses exploit a similar mechanism for RO formation. The host factor phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type III\u03b2 (PI4KB) is recruited to the replication sites by viral 3A protein (6\u20138). PI4KB is a cytosolic lipid kinase that must be recruited to membranes to exert its function and to generate a phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P)-enriched environment (7, 9). PI4P recruits and concentrates cellular proteins, and possibly also viral proteins, to facilitate viral genome replication (10, 11). Among the cellular proteins that interact with PI4P are lipid transfer proteins, such as oxysterol binding protein (OSBP) (12). Under normal conditions, OSBP creates membrane contact sites between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and PI4P-enriched trans-Golgi membranes and shuttles cholesterol in exchange for PI4P (13). In a similar manner, OSBP is recruited to RO membranes and mediates a PI4P-dependent flux of cholesterol from ER to ROs (14).",

Kobuviruses recruit PI4KB through ACBD3, which directly interacts with the viral protein 3A (7, 11). Recently, the crystal structure of the kobuvirus 3A-ACBD3 complex became available, which revealed the binding sites that are important for the 3A-ACBD3 interaction (6). Point mutations in 3A and ACBD3 at the binding interface inhibited the activation of PI4KB (17), suggesting that PI4KB recruitment to membranes via 3A-ACBD3-PI4KB interaction is necessary for kobuviruses to exploit PI4KB activity.",

The 3A proteins of several enteroviruses (e.g., PV and coxsackievirus B3 [CVB3]) bind to brefeldin A resistance guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1), a guanine exchange factor that activates the small GTPase Arf1. Arf1 interacts with PI4KB in noninfected cells. However, PI4KB recruitment by CVB3 and RV 3A likely occurs independently of GBF1 and Arf1 (18, 19). A number of enterovirus 3A proteins have been shown to bind to ACBD3 (8, 18). Therefore, several studies have investigated whether enteroviruses depend on ACBD3 to recruit PI4KB. While in one study, knockdown of ACBD3 in HeLa cells inhibited poliovirus (PV) replication (8), another reported no inhibition of PV replication in ACBD3 knockdown HEK-293T, IMR5, and HeLa cells (20). In our previous work, we did not observe inhibition of CVB3 or RV replication and no effects on PI4KB recruitment upon ACBD3 knockdown (18, 19).",

We observed that ACBD3 supports replication of representative viruses of different human enterovirus species (EV-A/B/C/D, RV-A/B) by mediating PI4KB recruitment by 3A. For the first time, we showed that the interaction between ACBD3 and PI4KB is crucial for enterovirus replication. In addition, we dissected the different domains of ACBD3 and uncovered that the glutamine-rich region (Q) and Golgi dynamics domain (GOLD) together suffice to support enterovirus replication. Furthermore, our data suggest that ACBD3 is important for proper 3A localization. Overall, our findings implicate that ACBD3 is not just an intermediate through which 3A recruits PI4KB but may play a central role in RO formation by scaffolding viral proteins and host proteins.",

Next, we evaluated enterovirus replication kinetics in ACBD3KO cells using representative viruses of four different human enterovirus species (EV-A71 [EV-A], CVB3 [EV-B], PV-1 [EV-C], and EV-D68 [EV-D]) and two rhinovirus species (RV-A2 [RV-A] and RV-B14 [RV-B)]). RV-C was not tested, as HeLa R19 cells are not susceptible to RV-C because they lack the receptor, cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR-3) (21). All of the viruses clearly showed deficient replication in ACBD3KO HeLa cells (Fig. 1A). Replication of enteroviruses was also impaired in another human cell line, haploid human cell line HAP1, in which ACBD3 was knocked out (Fig. S2).",

Replication of CVB3 and EV-A71 replicons transfected in HeLa ACBD3KO cells was reduced, which indicates a role for ACBD3 in the genome replication step (Fig. 1B). Next, to test whether ACBD3 functions in the same pathway as PI4KB in enterovirus replication, we employed a mutant virus that is less sensitive to PI4KB inhibition, CVB3 3A-H57Y (22). While the replication of wt CVB3 (RlucCVB3) was impaired in ACBD3KO cells, the replication of RlucCVB3 3A-H57Y was significantly increased (Fig. 1C). Encephalomyelitis virus (EMCV), which belongs to the genus Cardiovirus in the Picornaviridae family, depends on PI4KA but not on PI4KB for generating ROs (23). The replication of EMCV was not affected in ACBD3KO cells (Fig. S3), suggesting that the inhibition of CVB3 and EV-A71 replication in ACBD3KO cells is connected to the PI4KB pathway. Overall, these results indicate that ACBD3 is an important host factor for enterovirus replication.",

Since we observed delayed virus replication in ACBD3KO cells (Fig. 1A), different time points were chosen for HeLawt cells and ACBD3KO cells to mitigate possible effects of different replication levels on PI4KB recruitment. As previously shown, the CVB3 3A protein colocalized with ACBD3 (Fig. 2A) and PI4KB (Fig. 2B) throughout infection in infected HeLawt cells, which implies that both ACBD3 and PI4KB localize to CVB3 ROs. PI4KB was more concentrated in 3A-positive cells than in 3A-negative cells, which suggests that it is actively recruited to virus replication sites. Notwithstanding the similar level of 3A expression compared to HeLawt cells (Fig. 2A and B), no recruitment of PI4KB was observed in infected ACBD3KO cells at any time point (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that ACBD3 mediates recruitment of PI4KB during enterovirus replication.",

To further investigate whether PI4KB recruitment by 3A is mediated by ACBD3, we transiently expressed the 3A proteins from representative human enteroviruses from seven different species (EV-A/B/C/D and RV-A/B/C) with either a C-terminal myc tag or an N-terminal GFP tag and examined the localization of ACBD3 and PI4KB (Fig. 3 and Fig. S4). In HeLawt cells, all 3A proteins colocalized with ACBD3 (Fig. 3A). PI4KB was more concentrated in cells expressing 3A than in cells that did not express 3A, and it colocalized with 3A (Fig. 3A), which indicates that PI4KB is actively recruited by enterovirus 3A proteins. In contrast, no PI4KB recruitment was observed in ACBD3KO cells expressing any of the enterovirus 3A proteins (Fig. 3B). These results imply that all enteroviruses utilize a shared mechanism to recruit PI4KB to replication sites, which is via a 3A-ACBD3-PI4KB interaction. Interestingly, we noticed that the localization of 3A differs from HeLawt cells to ACBD3KO cells (Fig. 3 and Fig. S5). Unlike the punctate localization in HeLawt cells (Fig. 3A), 3A proteins were dispersed throughout the cytoplasm in ACBD3KO cells into a more reticular pattern (Fig. 3B and Fig. S5), suggesting that ACBD3 is important for proper localization of 3A.",

            "text": "Because the typical punctate localization of 3A on Golgi-derived membranes is lost in ACBD3KO cells, we assessed the overall structure of the Golgi and ER as well as the colocalization between 3A and markers for the Golgi (GM130 and TGN46) and ER (calreticulin). In mock-transfected cells, no gross differences in localization of any of the above markers were observed between HeLawt cells and ACBD3KO cells, although in some ACBD3KO cells, the Golgi appeared to be slightly more scattered than in HeLawt cells (Fig. 4). Importantly, this slight Golgi scattering clearly differs from the massive Golgi scattering that can be observed upon knockout of structural Golgi proteins GRASP55 and GRASP65 (24). Nevertheless, smaller disruptions of Golgi structure that cannot be readily visualized at the light microscopy level cannot be excluded. Indeed, others have reported fragmentation of Golgi cisternae when they studied ACBD3 knockdown cells by electron microscopy (25). As previously described, the disintegration of the Golgi in enterovirus-infected cells and in 3A-expressing cells is likely a consequence of the blockage of ER-to-Golgi transport that depends on the interaction between 3A and GBF1/Arf1 (26, 27). In agreement with this, overexpression of 3A caused disassembly of the Golgi apparatus in both wt and ACBD3KO HeLa cells (Fig. 4B and C), pointing out that the disruption of the Golgi by 3A occurs independently of ACBD3. 3A partially colocalized with the Golgi markers but not the ER marker in HeLawt cells, whereas 3A was localized to the ER, as labeled by calreticulin, in ACBD3KO cells (Fig. 4B to D). This suggests that 3A cannot localize to the Golgi without ACBD3, which may contribute to the lack of PI4KB recruitment. Collectively, our results suggest that ACBD3 is not merely a mediator between 3A and PI4KB but that it plays a central role in recruiting 3A and PI4KB to facilitate virus replication.",

We confirmed that the F258A/Q259A mutant (hereafter called the FQ mutant) lost its interaction with PI4KB by coimmunoprecipitation (Fig. S7) and employed this mutant to test whether the ACBD3-PI4KB interaction is required for PI4KB recruitment and efficient enterovirus replication. Expression of the ACBD3-FQ mutant restored the punctate localization of 3A (Fig. 5A, bottom panel) but did not support PI4KB recruitment (Fig. 5B, bottom panel). Furthermore, exogenous expression of wt ACBD3 in ACBD3KO cells restored replication of CVB3 to a level comparable to that in HeLawt cells, while the negative control (GalT) and ACBD3-FQ mutant could not restore virus replication in ACBD3KO cells (Fig. 5C). Taken together, we showed that 3A localization to the Golgi-derived membranes occurs in an ACBD3-dependent manner and that the interaction between ACBD3-PI4KB is crucial for PI4KB recruitment and efficient virus replication.",

In agreement with this, the I43A mutant failed to coimmunoprecipitate ACBD3 from cells (Fig. S7). While wt PI4KB reconstituted in PI4KBKO cells colocalized with 3A and ACBD3 (Fig. 6B and C, top panels), the PI4KB-I43A mutant did not colocalize with 3A and ACBD3, and instead mostly localized to the nucleus (middle panels). Unexpectedly, the D44A mutant did colocalize with 3A and ACBD3 (bottom panels). In line with this, wt PI4KB and the D44A mutant could restore enterovirus replication in PI4KBKO cells, while the I43A mutant and the negative controls, EGFP and a PI4KB kinase-dead mutant that lacks catalytic activity (PI4KB-KD), could not (Fig. 6D). Why the D44A mutant behaves differently from the I43A mutant is presently unclear. Possibly, the D44A mutant has residual interaction with ACBD3 that could not be detected in vitro. Nevertheless, these results imply that the interaction between ACBD3 and PI4KB is important for enterovirus replication.",

The ACB domain, which is relatively conserved among all known ACBD proteins (ACBD1 to ACBD7), has been suggested to be important for binding to long-chain acyl-CoA (29) and for binding to sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), causing reduction of de novo palmitate synthesis (30). The CAR domain contains a nuclear localization signal (31), yet the function of the CAR domain is unknown. The Q domain interacts with the N-terminal helix of PI4KB (12, 18). The GOLD domain interacts with giantin, and by doing so, tethers ACBD3 to the Golgi membrane (31). Enterovirus and kobuvirus 3A proteins bind to the GOLD domain, most probably at the same site as giantin (7, 18). To investigate the importance of the ACB and CAR domains for enterovirus replication, we tested whether N-terminal deletion mutants of ACBD3 could restore enterovirus replication in ACBD3KO cells. mut1 and mut2, which contain intact Q and GOLD domains, could restore virus replication to a level comparable to cells reconstituted with wt ACBD3 (Fig. 7B). This is in alignment with our observation that these mutants colocalize with 3A and PI4KB in ACBD3KO cells (Fig. 7C). In contrast, mut3, which contains only the GOLD domain, could not rescue virus replication (Fig. 7B) or PI4KB recruitment (Fig. 7C), like the negative controls (GalT and the FQ mutant) (Fig. 7B), even though all mutants colocalized with 3A (Fig. 7C). Of note, although mut3 and 3A colocalized in punctate structures, they also partly colocalized to reticular and nuclear envelope-like structures, which may indicate that PI4KB also plays a role in firmly localizing 3A and ACBD3 to Golgi-derived membranes. These results indicate that enterovirus replication requires the Q and GOLD domains of ACBD3 for localization of viral protein 3A to the Golgi and for hijacking PI4KB.",

Viral protein 3A is responsible for PI4KB recruitment to enterovirus replication sites, yet the underlying mechanism has remained elusive. Despite the direct interaction between ACBD3 and enterovirus 3A proteins (8, 18), there has not yet been a consensus about the importance of ACBD3 for enterovirus replication and PI4KB recruitment. Previously, we observed no inhibition of CVB3 and RV replication and no effects on PI4KB recruitment, even though more than 90% of ACBD3 knockdown was achieved by siRNA (18, 19). In the present study in which we use ACBD3KO cells, we showed that ACBD3 is an important host factor for replication of four different human enterovirus species (EV-A/B/C/D) and two rhinovirus species (RV-A/B). All viruses showed impaired growth in ACBD3KO cells (Fig. 1 and Fig. S2). In addition, neither virus infection (Fig. 2) nor the expression of enterovirus 3A proteins alone (Fig. 3) elicited PI4KB recruitment in the absence of ACBD3. In agreement with our data, the inhibition of EV-A71 and CVB3 was recently reported in ACBD3KO cells (32\u201334). The discrepancy in the role of ACBD3 from KD to KO condition could result from insufficient suppression of ACBD3 function by RNA interference. In fact, this implies that the small amounts (\u223c10%) of ACBD3 that remained after knockdown are sufficient to support enterovirus replication and PI4KB recruitment. Similar issues on the differences between knockdown and knockout have been raised by others (35). For instance, the importance of cyclophilin A (CypA) in nidovirus replication was prominent only in CypA knockout cells but not in knockdown cells, even though CypA protein was undetectable after knockdown (36).",

Upon reconstitution of wt ACBD3 in ACBD3KO cells, the localization of 3A was restored to a punctate pattern (Fig. 5A).

For example, ACBD3 and PV1 3A were found in a protein complex together with the putative Rab33 GTPase-activating proteins TBC1D22A/B (37). In addition, several Golgi stacking proteins such as Golgin45 and Golgi reassembly stacking protein 2 (GORASP2) were recently identified as novel interaction partners of ACBD3, and ACBD3 was proposed as a scaffold tethering Golgin45, GRASP55, and TBC1D22 for the formation of a Golgi cisternal adhesion complex at the medial Golgi (38). It is largely unknown which domains of ACBD3 are responsible for the interaction with the above-mentioned interacting partners and whether these proteins are recruited to enterovirus ROs also remains to be investigated.",

By utilizing mutants of ACBD3 or PI4KB which disturb the interaction with each other (Fig. 5 and 7), we show for the first time that the interaction between ACBD3 and PI4KB is crucial for enterovirus replication. Aside from the Q and GOLD domains, other domains (i.e., ACB and CAR) of ACBD3 seem to be not involved in enterovirus replication (Fig. 7). This indicates that the functions of the ACB and CAR domains, as well as the cellular proteins and/or lipids that interact with these domains, are unlikely required for enterovirus replication. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that additional or unidentified proteins that bind to the Q or GOLD domain of ACBD3 might also be important for enterovirus replication, our findings suggest that ACBD3 mainly serves to coordinate 3A and PI4KB recruitment at RO membranes, involving the Q and GOLD domains.",

Similarly, kobuvirus 3A interacts with the ACBD3 GOLD domain, and the crystal structure of kobuvirus 3A in complex with the ACBD3 GOLD domain was revealed recently (6). According to this structure, kobuvirus 3A wraps ACBD3 and stabilizes ACBD3 on membranes through the membrane binding features at the myristoylated N-terminal and hydrophobic C-terminal ends of 3A. However, enterovirus 3A proteins can bind to membranes only through the hydrophobic C terminus, and the 3A proteins of enteroviruses differ greatly in sequence from kobuvirus 3A. Therefore, the way by which enterovirus 3A interacts with ACBD3 could be different from that of kobuvirus. Thus, structural insight into the enterovirus 3A- ACBD3 GOLD complex is urgently required to understand how enterovirus 3A interacts with ACBD3.",
