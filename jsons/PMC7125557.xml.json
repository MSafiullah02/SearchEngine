The first documented outbreak occurred primarily in China from 2002\u20132004 with regional outbreaks in North America and Europe attributed to human-to-human transmission from infected international travelers. Genetic characterization suggests that the introduction into the human population occurred from civets or other mammals found in live-animal markets of China.1 A total of 8096 cases from 29 countries, including 774 fatalities were identified during the course of the outbreak (case fatality rate: 9.6%).2 A robust international response costing an estimated 40 billion dollars helped contain the outbreak by 2004, with no new cases reported since then.2 In November 2017, a colony of horseshoe bats in southwestern China harboring a genetically similar coronavirus was identified and raised the possibility that the virus originated in bats before spreading to the aforementioned animal markets.3\n",

Later phase disease demonstrates a combination of diffuse alveolar damage (Fig. 1B) and acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia. In addition, features of squamous metaplasia, multinuclear giant cell formation, and intravascular microthrombi may be apparent. Intracytoplasmic viral inclusions have also been described in alveolar epithelial cells (Fig. 1C).9 Autopsy cases from the SARS outbreak have not revealed a correlation between the pattern of damage and a clinically significant outcome. Furthermore, no pathognomic autopsy features have been identified.7, 10 As the majority of patient specimens were taken from autopsy, there is little documentation of the pathologic presentation of SARS-CoV in living patients. One report documents a single open lung biopsy that was taken approximately one week after symptom onset in a patient subsequently diagnosed with SARS. Pathologic findings included a mild increase in interstitial lymphocytes and a moderate increase of alveolar macrophages with hyaline membrane formation. There were occasional pneumocytes demonstrating viral cytopathic-like changes including cytomegaly with nuclear enlargement and prominent nucleoli.7\n",

There have been 2266 confirmed cases of MERS and 804 fatalities (case fatality: 35.5%).20 Significant molecular and serological data point to dromedary camels as the source of transmission into human populations.21 Whether camels are an intermediate host or reservoir is still under research. Studies have found fragments of MERS-CoV genomic material identical to human isolates in bat populations.22 While transmission from camels may introduce MERS-CoV into human populations, the majority of reported cases have resulted from human-to-human nosocomial transmission. In one outbreak, a single ill patient admitted to a Korean hospital led to 186 infections including 36 fatal cases.23 Person-to-person spread has also been documented within households, where patient respiratory secretions and close proximity carry the highest risk of tranmission.24 For these reasons, patients with symptoms and epidemiological features suggestive of MERS should be rapidly quarantined and tested for viral infection.",

In general, older patients and those with chronic comorbid conditions (diabetes, heart disease) are at greatest risk for progression to respiratory failure.23 Despite the high mortality associated with symptomatic cases, studies have revealed that approximately 25% of patients are asymptomatic when infected with MERS-COV.25 Clinical disease in children is uncommon.23 A seroepidemiological study of over 10,000 patient samples from Saudi Arabia found positive antibodies in 0.15% of patients. Those with camel-exposure had a higher probability of positive serology and may serve as an asymptomatic or subclinical transmission source.26 Clinical symptoms are non-specific and include runny nose, sore throat, and myalgias. The incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 days.23 Symptoms appear before the patient reaches a detectable viremia. In addition to respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal distress and neurological sequelae have been documented.23 The most common laboratory derangements observed are leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia.",

In a case reported by Ng et al. a man died 8 days after admission due to respiratory failure and shock.27, 28 Studies included histology, immunohistochemistry with multiple MERS-CoV antibodies, and ultrastructural evaluation. The primary finding at autopsy was viral-mediated lung damage with features of diffuse alveolar damage. Infected cell types included pneumocytes, multinucleated epithelial cells, and bronchial submucosal glands. These infected cells expressed DPP-4 surface antigen which serves as the cell receptor of MERS-CoV. Samples of other DPP-4 positive tissues including lymphoreticular system, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, and brain were negative for virus by multiple methods.29 In a second documented autopsy, the patient was a 33-year-old man receiving chemotherapy for T-cell lymphoma who received an antemortem diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection by sputum PCR; cause of death was attributed to respiratory and renal failure. The autopsy revealed a necrotizing pneumonia with diffuse alveolar damage (Fig. 1D), but was partly limited by possible confounding effects of therapy and tissue samples limited to needle core biopsies. Viral inclusions were identified by electron microscopy not only in the respiratory epithelium but also the epithelial cells of the renal proximal tubules.30 Also reported in the literature is a case of a man who 8 weeks following infection with MERS-CoV underwent renal biopsy. Histology demonstrated acute tubular sclerosis with proteinaceous cast formation, acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, and no glomerulosclerosis. In situ hybridization and electron microscopy of renal tissue was negative for viral components.31\n",

All strains infected non-ciliated bronchial epithelium and alveolar epithelial cells including type II pneumocytes. No infection of the pulmonary macrophages was identified.33 Studies in kidney explants demonstrated infection of multiple cell types including renal tubular cells, vascular endothelial cells, and podocytes.\n34 Experimental infection of small intestine explants with MERS-CoV demonstrated infection limited to the surface enterocytes and formation of syncytial cells. In keeping with these observations, infected patients have been found to shed virus in their urine and stool.35 Mouse models expressing the human DPP-4 receptor were rapidly developed after the discovery of the virus. These models have been used to further understand the inflammatory patterns and viral localization, which identified evidence of the virus in the lungs, brain, heart, spleen, and intestines.36 A Rhesus macaque model demonstrated a similar disease phenotype as seen in humans, including pulmonary consolidation, edematous lung lesions, and pneumonia. Also frequently observed were multinucleated giant cells and acute diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation. In one study, infectious virus was identified in the lung, but not in the upper respiratory track, blood, or other solid organs.37, 38, 39\n",

Important to the success of these tests is an understanding of the viral kinetics and tissue tropism found in MERS-CoV cases. Several studies have documented that lower respiratory tract samples provide the highest viral loads. The virus may also be detected in upper respiratory swabs, whole blood or serum, feces, and urine.35 Despite 10 to 100 times lower virus levels, samples from the upper respiratory tract and blood can provide additional diagnostic utility by providing a convenient sample type. Blood is only positive in one-half to one-third of cases, but detectable viremia at the time of diagnosis has been associated with an increased requirement for mechanical ventilation and patient death.\n40 The limited viremia rate is in contrast to SARS-CoV, where RT-PCR on blood can be helpful for initial diagnosis and is often the first positive site identified. For MERS-CoV, testing of upper and lower respiratory samples along with patient blood may help maximize the sensitivity while also stratifying risk. Two RT-PCR testing strategies have been granted emergency use authorization by the FDA: both target a region upstream of the envelope gene; while one additionally targets a region of the ORF1a gene, the other targets two regions within the nucleocapsid gene.41, 42\n",

These larger shifts are central to the pandemic potential of the virus as it can result in novel antigens not previously seen in the human population. The virus (H1N1pdm09) first emerged in Mexico during the spring of 2009.45 The virus contains gene segments from human, porcine, and avian influenza strains.46 The WHO documented 17,483 laboratory-confirmed influenza fatalities from over 213 countries during the 2009 outbreak, although this is likely a gross under-representation as the CDC estimated 12,469 influenza fatalities in the US alone.47 Estimates of the global mortality resulting from influenza pandemics has decreased from 1\u20133% in 1918 to 0.001\u20130.007% during 2009.47 A significant contributing factor to the mortality difference is thought to be due to expanded medical interventions, including improved treatment of acute respiratory distress and secondary bacterial pneumonias.

During the 2009 pandemic healthcare researchers expanded their study of viral receptor binding, replication within the lower respiratory system, and molecular characterization of secondary bacterial pneumonia. Autopsy case series from multiple countries were published and used a variety of techniques including ultrastructural, immunohistochemical, in situ hybridization, and molecular methods to varying degrees to gain insight into the pathology of pandemic influenza infections. The majority of reports came from public health laboratories and varied from single case reports to cohorts of up to 100 fatal cases.51, 52, 53\n",

The majority of clinical diagnostic labs have shifted to using rapid molecular tests, which may be performed as a laboratory-developed real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) panel or cartridge-based assay.64, 65 These methods demonstrate excellent analytic parameters and have a turn-around time on the order of minutes to hours. However, the shortcomings of these rapid molecular tests were made evident during the 2009 pandemic. As the primer and probe sets were designed around recent seasonal strains of influenza A and B, the novel genetic elements of the 2009 pandemic strain significantly reduced the sensitivity and specificity of these tests.66 Fortunately, molecular assays were rapidly adapted to detect the 2009 pandemic strain. Rapid antigen tests, already less sensitive than molecular testing, were noted to be particularly insensitive to the 2009 pandemic strain.66 Clinical laboratories should increase their suspicion of negative results during a novel pathogen outbreak and work closely with state public health laboratories to validate new strain testing.",

            "text": "\nLegionella pneumophila was initially recognized as the agent of atypical pneumonia associated with the namesake Legionnaire's convention in Philadelphia in 1976. Legionella species are opportunistic pathogens comprising a diverse genus with over 50 species and over 70 serogroups. Roughly one-half have been described associated with human disease.69\nL. pneumophila serogroup 1 is most commonly associated with human infection, although other serogroups and species together cause a substantial disease burden.70, 71\nLegionella can also cause non-respiratory diseases such as Pontiac fever as well as rare wound and other infections. The organism is a facultative intracellular Gram-negative rod that is common in the environment and naturally infects several species of free-living amoeba in a process that parallels infection of the mammalian macrophage. Despite highly evolved virulence traits the disease typically occurs in immunocompromised patients and those with respiratory compromise.72 Host amoeba include both soil and water-dwelling species; most human infections in the western hemisphere with known sources are attributable to inhalation of water from human-engineered water systems. The organism, likely in concert with its host amoeba, colonize fresh water systems including air conditioners, heater-coolers, potable water systems, etc. and form tenacious biofilms that are extremely challenging to clear. Showers, fountains, artificial waterfalls, and other similar sources that generate aerosols or droplets are a particular risk. Infection is both nosocomial and community-acquired. Only one case of possible human-to-human transmission has been documented and transmission from natural water sources is not widely recognized.73 The disease is thought to cause \u223c2\u20139% of community-acquired pneumonias.72\nLegionella is a nationally reportable infection and has demonstrated a 5.5-fold increase in cases from 2000\u20132017 to an approximate 7500 reported cases in 2017, although that figure may represent as few as 5% of actual cases.72, 74 The increase in cases is not entirely understood, but may represent increased reporting, changing environmental factors, or increased host susceptibility.74 Infections from species other than L. pneumophila can cause disease in a high portion of patients in some areas, but these species are often under-appreciated because the most common diagnostic test only detects L. pneumophila serogroup 1. Many reports indicate Legionella micdadei is the second most common species to cause human disease.70, 75\n",

Fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, bradycardia, altered mental status, leukocytosis, hyponatremia, and elevated transaminases are common and may present before respiratory symptoms.77 The presence of these extrapulmonary findings should raise the clinical suspicion for the disease compared to the more common bacterial pneumonias. Radiologic findings are non-specific and can include progressive patchy infiltrates, consolidation, and pleural effusions. The disease can also present with cavitary lesion(s), especially L. micdadei: In one series of 27 patients, 20% had cavitary disease.78 Case fatality rates are highly variable from \u223c5\u201340%. Most fatalities are attributed to L. pneumophila, however, death from L. micdadei is also common despite demonstrated lower virulence in in vitro models.75, 79 Treatment is with levofloxacin or azithromycin; empiric treatment with beta-lactams can delay time to effective therapy, as they are considered ineffective.",

However, in the appropriate clinicopathologic context, the presence of several features should raise the question of Legionella in the differential diagnosis and the appropriate clinical laboratory testing should be considered. Gross findings include congested firm and distended lungs, weighing an average of \u223c2000\u20132500 g; disease presents unilaterally or bilaterally and most commonly as lobular or confluent lobular pneumonia.80, 81 Cavitations, nodules, abscesses, and empyema may be present, particularly with L. micdadei (Fig. 2\nA).81 Microscopic findings include marked fibrinopurulent exudate with a mixed necrotic infiltrate of neutrophils and macrophages that completely fills the alveolar spaces (Fig. 2B).80 Compared to other acute bacterial pneumonias, there is a relative abundance of macrophages.80 The organism stains weakly or not at all by Gram or Brown and Hopps (Fig. 2D). The organism is most evident on silver stains, including Warthin-Starry, Steiner, or Dieterle. The organism can be seen intracellularly within macrophages or free in the necrotic milieu. L. micdadei, but not other species, stain using both microbiologic and histopathologic modified acid-fast stains (Fite) (Fig. 2D), which can lead to diagnostic mis-adventures.81, 82 In addition to Mycobacteria and several parasites, a handful of Gram-positive organisms including Nocardia, Rhodococcus, Tsukamurella, Gordonia, and Dietzia can also stain by modified acid-fast stains. In contrast to L. micdadei, all of these organisms should stain Gram positive. In addition, Nocardia appears as a branching Gram positive rods, helping differentiate it from L. micdadei. Independently, positive staining with Fite can be particularly helpful when culture was not performed and molecular studies fail to amplify nucleic acid. Immunohistochemical stains are not widely available. Electron microscopy was critical in the early understanding of the infection and organism's life cycle, but does not play a role in routine diagnosis. The histopathologic infectious differential includes influenzae and non-necrotizing hemorrhagic bacterial pneumonias, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilis influenzae, and S. pneumoniae.\n",

            "text": "It is crucial for the anatomic pathologist to understand the different clinical laboratory diagnostics for Legionella species given the array of available tests and their limitations. For example, the diligent autopsy pathologist who reviews a patient chart and notes a negative lower respiratory culture and urine antigen test may be misled away from a diagnosis of Legionella infection even though the etiology could still be a Legionella sp. not detected by these methods. The gold standard clinical laboratory diagnostic is culture. Legionella spp. are relatively slow growing in vitro, typically taking 3\u20134 days to form colonies, and do not grow on routine clinical solid media. Agar plates supplemented with activated charcoal are required for growth (i.e. charcoal-buffered yeast extract; BCYE). Because of these limitations and cumbersome nature of these cultures, many clinical microbiology laboratories do not perform cultures for the organism and even when they do, these special media may not be included in all routine lower respiratory cultures. More widely available and used is the urine antigen test, which is available as an FDA-cleared simple lateral flow assay with high sensitivity and specificity that can be performed within \u223c15 min. The critical caveat is that the assay only detects the excreted antigens of L. pneumophila serogroup 1. Additional caveats include a small percent of patients that do not excrete the antigen and frequently the antigen can be detected for several weeks after infection, which complicates interpretation of the time-course of infection.69, 83 Studies vary greatly in the local species and serogroup distributions; likely components of actual geographic distribution of the organism and reporting bias. In one study, half of all sporadic cases over a 15 year period were due to species other than L. pneumophila serogroup 1.75 Culture has the additional benefit of supporting epidemiologic investigations and infection control. It yields a bacterial isolate that can be compared to environmental isolates from hospital water sources or other human-engineered systems in question by strain typing assays. This has historically been performed by pulse field gel electrophoresis or sequence-based typing of a limited number of alleles, but is contemporarily performed with a higher degree of resolution by whole genome sequencing (WGS).84 WGS is most commonly performed by public health laboratories for outbreak investigations, but is also available in at least one CLIA laboratory to support rapid decision making by hospital infection control experts.",

Methodologies and target sequences vary, but frequently employ RT-PCR with or without amplicon sequencing. Legionella genus-specific regions of the 16S rRNA gene, 5S rRNA, and mip, are often targeted.85 Assays vary as to whether they detect all or most Legionella species, L. pneumophila only, or a limited number of species. Although these molecular assays are not as rapid as the urine antigen test and are more expensive, they are highly sensitive, can be performed faster than culture, and have the distinct advantage of detecting strains other than L. pneumophila serogroup 1. Legionella-specific PCR assays are available for FFPE samples, although in a limited number of public health and CLIA reference laboratories. The availability of these assays for FFPE can be particularly useful for the autopsy pathologist when Legionella was not suspected antemortem. Broad-range 16S rRNA also may detect the organism, however, frequently at a reduced sensitivity compared to the species-specific assays. Serology and immunofluorescence have historical roles, but have a limited role in contemporary clinical diagnosis. The organism stains poorly by safranin Gram counter stain. L. micdadei is modified acid-fast stain positive (mAFB), as discussed above.",

Although many of the different infectious agents cause similar histopathologic features, some features can help narrow sufficiently the differential diagnosis to successfully harness more specific molecular methods. On the other hand, many molecular laboratory assays target only specific pathogens and the assays require intact nucleic acid in the specimen. Cultures cast a broad net, but may also require specific growth conditions to isolate microorganisms. Knowing the broad array of different diagnostic methods is paramount in identifying emerging and reemerging pathogens.",
