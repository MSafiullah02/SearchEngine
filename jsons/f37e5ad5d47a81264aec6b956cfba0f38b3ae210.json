One of the largest contributing factors to thriving flocks is the development and proper functioning of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The avian GI tract represents a site of nutrient absorption and contains many different types of microorganisms (collectively known as the microbiome) and plays host to a variety of commensal and pathogenic microbes including viruses, bacteria, and fungi. Suboptimal functioning of the GI tract can result in poor performance and can lead to production problems such as a poorer feed conversion ratio (FCR; the efficiency of converting feed to body mass), uneven flock growth, and can be caused by enteric diseases such as runting-stunting syndrome (RSS) in broiler chickens.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "RSS, also known as malabsorption syndrome, was reported in broiler flocks as early as the 1970s by Kouwenhoven et al.

Further research described a wide variety of clinical signs including growth depression, irregular feathering (helicopter feathering, abnormal colouring), the presence of watery diarrhoea, other enteric problems such as intestinal lesions and pale intestines, and in severe cases mortality (Smart et al., 1988; Shapiro et al., 1998; Otto et al., 2006; De Wit et al., 2011) .

This was similar to samples VF14-92 A2 and VF14-181 A1 which displayed a very low amount of phage contigs (3.82% and 4.62% respectively) compared to the large abundance of phage contigs identified in samples VF14-91 A1 (67.01%), VF14-91 A2 (24.65%), VF14-92 A1 (81.64%), and VF14-181 B1 (58.76%). An increase in viral contigs associated with the Caudovirales may coincide with an overgrowth of specific groups of intestinal bacteria which are then infected by species-specific bacteriophages helping regulate the intestinal microbiota. The majority of the viral contigs assigned to the Caudovirales were identified as enterobacteria phages, enterococcus phages, and bacteroides phages which relate to normal bacterial constituents of the chicken GI tract such as Escherichia coli, Enterococcus species, and Bacteroides species (Devriese et al., 1991; Lu et al., 2003; Amit-Romach et al., 2004) . These viruses are widespread and coexist with bacterial populations across a large range of hosts and environments and aid in regulating the diversity, population, and function of microbial communities (Riesenfeld et al., 2004) . The role of bacteriophages in relation to RSS is unclear and represents an interesting group for further study since previous metagenomic studies have also detected members of the Caudovirales order as part of the broiler chicken gut microbiota in growth retarded flocks (Kim & Mundt, 2011; .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2255, "end": 2278, "text": "(Devriese et al., 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2279, "end": 2295, "text": "Lu et al., 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 2296, "end": 2321, "text": "Amit-Romach et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2526, "end": 2551, "text": "(Riesenfeld et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 2825, "end": 2844, "text": "(Kim & Mundt, 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 163, "end": 172, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 261, "end": 270, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 551, "end": 560, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 1073, "end": 1081, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 1416, "end": 1425, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Caudovirales"}, {"text": "Of the remaining viral families 154 contigs were assigned to the Herpesviridae family. Samples VF13-188 E and VF14-92 A2 displayed a higher Herpesviridae abundance (10.96% and 16.96% respectively) compared to all other samples which displayed a more even spread (2.02-6.06%). Contigs assigned to this family displayed similarity to the Cytomegalovirus genus ( Figure 2) , with 143 contigs displaying similarity to the Ceropithicine herpesvirus 5 species. Within this species all contigs assigned displayed greatest similarity (77-100% nucleotide identity) to stealth virus 1. Additionally, the small number of contigs in the \"unclassified virus\" category (Table 1 , sample VF13-188 E) contained three contigs displaying high similarity to the species stealth virus 4 and 5 (95-100% nucleotide identity). Stealth virus 1 has previously been isolated from human hosts displaying signs such as chronic fatigue (Martin et al., 1995) and encephalopathy (Martin, 1996) however no studies have been conducted in relation to avian hosts but it has been shown to be transmissible to dogs and cats (Martin & Anderson, 1997) . This study appears to be the first study to report the presence of stealth virus in RSSaffected broiler chickens however further studies must be undertaken to understand the role this virus plays in disease.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 907, "end": 928, "text": "(Martin et al., 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 948, "end": 962, "text": "(Martin, 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 1088, "end": 1113, "text": "(Martin & Anderson, 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 360, "end": 369, "text": "Figure 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 655, "end": 663, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Herpesviridae"}, {"text": "Most previous investigations into the enteric viruses associated with poultry have been limited to culturedependant methods and molecular assays targeting previously known viruses. The use of high-throughput NGS in this study, and a small number of other studies, presents a viable technique for the characterization of the complex viral communities present in the GI tract of disease-affected and unaffected broiler chickens. This study presents preliminary data on the viral communities present in the poultry gut from a small number of samples and has identified multiple viral families historically associated with RSS co-infecting broiler guts, along with the broad characterization of other viral families such as the Siphoviridae, Myoviridae, and Podoviridae in relation to the disease. Additionally, this study attempts to characterize the virome associated with unaffected broiler chickens with the results showing a difference in the viral contigs assigned in the unaffected samplestypically many of the same families are observed in unaffected samples but with a lower number of viral contigs assigned to these families when compared to affected samples. The main viral families related to RSS-affected samples from this study included Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, Parvoviridae, Coronaviridae, Siphoviridae, and Myoviridae although many of these viral families were also found in unaffected samples indicating that certain strains within these families may be constituents of a normal broiler gut virome. One of the advantages of the sequencing platforms used is their ability to be semi-quantitative; the sequencing reads and contigs output by the platforms are assumed to be representative of the microbial contents within a tested sample. However, the use of whole genome and WTA steps in the sequencing procedures have previously been shown to introduce bias to sequencing results (Pinard et al., 2006) resulting in a non-quantitative analysis. The present study had to use whole genome and WTA methods to generate sufficient viral genomic material from samples for library preparation and as such these results cannot be considered quantitative however the kit used to perform these procedures was shown to generally minimize bias when compared to other similar kits (Pinard et al., 2006) . Furthermore it might be assumed that any bias from WGA methods may apply equally across all samples although further bias may be subsequently introduced by library preparation methods specific to each platform or kit. Subsequent quantitative studies currently underway via quantitative real-time PCR will help clarify the roles these viruses play in RSS and would aid in understanding the differences in viral load associated with each virus. These studies will also help characterize the differences between affected and unaffected birds leading to a greater knowledge of the key viral agents associated with RSS.", "cite_spans": [{"start":
