            "text": "As infectious diseases are identified for the first time or emerge in new populations, researchers increasingly use mathematical models to describe observed patterns and to plan and evaluate public health responses (Anderson and May, 1992, Grassly and Fraser, 2008, Keeling and Danon, 2009, Anderson et al., 2015). These models vary in complexity and scale, from simple compartmental models (Hethcote, 2000) to complex stochastic agent-based and metapopulation approaches that include external information like transportation networks (Rvachev and Longini, 1985, Hufnagel et al., 2004, Eubank et al., 2004, Ferguson et al., 2006, Balcan et al., 2010, Ajelli et al., 2010, Van den Broeck et al., 2011). The latter have been shown to efficiently capture the real-time spread of epidemics (Tizzoni et al., 2012), but often require large amounts of information. Key parameters need to be estimated from epidemiological data, which may be accomplished by maximum likelihood estimation (Ionides et al., 2006, Bret\u00f3 et al., 2009, King et al., 2015) or data assimilation (Rhodes and Hollingsworth, 2009, Shaman and Karspeck, 2012). However, for newly emerging infections or when estimating the impact of bioterrorism events (Walden and Kaplan, 2004, Rotz and Hughes, 2004), such information may not always be available. Sometimes, the community is able to quickly compile and share epidemiological parameters, as was for instance the case for the devastating 2014/2015 Ebola outbreak (Van Kerkhove et al., 2015, Chowell et al., 2014). It is nevertheless expected that model choices reflect the balance between data availability and the needs of the public health community (Keeling and Danon, 2009). Moreover, since the accuracy of predictions depends heavily on modeling assumptions (Keeling and Danon, 2009, Wearing et al., 2005), it is also important to balance the need for detailed, realistic models against limitations in parameter information (May, 2004).",

Entire epidemiological curves can often be fitted with standard functions, such as for instance a logistic curve or the Richards model (Tj\u00f8rve and Tj\u00f8rve, 2010, Peleg and Corradini, 2011, Wang et al., 2012, Ma et al., 2014), but are only effective late into the outbreak. Conversely, time series approaches allow forecasting, but are considered accurate only for short-term prediction. For instance, using only case data and an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, researchers were able to forecast hospital bed utilization during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Singapore up to three days forward (Earnest et al., 2005). Additional information is usually required for longer forecasts (see e.g. 3-month dengue forecasting using climate data (Gharbi et al., 2011)), limiting the utility of such approaches for newly emerging diseases, when many associated risk factors are still unknown.",

We present an automated parameter extraction method that allows us to explore the applicability of the method to a variety of different outbreaks and, more importantly, explain how the model may be used to forecast the scope of ongoing outbreaks, including those of some vector-borne diseases.",

Starting from reported epidemiological data, we consider the cumulative number of cases, C, and numerically produce a smooth interpolation of its evolution (panel 1). Data collection procedures for the examples discussed in this article are given in Technical Appendix 1 in Supplementary Material. We then use this smoothed data to estimate incidence, G, as described in Technical Appendix 2 (see Supplementary Material). The crucial point of our approach is that rather than plotting C as a function of time, we plot the estimated incidence G, as a function of cumulative cases, C, G(C) (panel 2). For many outbreaks, the graph of G as a function of C has a single \u201chump\u201d and can, at first order, be approximated by an inverted parabola (panel 3). This inverted parabola, whose equation contains two parameters, defines a simple model for the evolution of the outbreak, which can be used to predict future number of cases given an initial condition (panel 4). We developed a method, detailed in Technical Appendix 3 in Supplementary Material, that automatically associates a parabola to available epidemiological data of one-wave outbreaks. It works on partial (for ongoing outbreaks) or full (for outbreaks that have completed their course) data sets and proceeds as follows: rather than attempting to estimate the parabola parameters from the cumulative epidemiological curve, we fit the graph of G(C) to its parabolic approximation and the graph of C(t) to its corresponding time course, simultaneously. Doing so therefore demands that the two unknown parameters describing the parabola be chosen to provide good approximations of two different (albeit related) plots. This approach is easily applicable to ongoing outbreaks for which limited data are available, and can therefore be used for forecasting.",

The model was tested in detail on nine one-wave outbreaks: 2014\u201315 chikungunya outbreaks in the Dominican Republic (Fig. 2A), Guadeloupe (Fig. A1), and Dominica (Fig. A2); 2014\u201315 Ebola outbreaks in Guinea (Fig. A3), Liberia (Fig. A4), and Sierra Leone (Fig. A5); 2008 outbreak of Salmonella SaintPaul in the US (Fig. A6); 2008 outbreak of gastroenteritis in Majorca (Fig. 2B); and 2009 outbreak of H1N1 in Canada (Fig. A7), as well as on one two-wave outbreak of pertussis (2011\u201312 in the state of Washington, US; Fig. 4). The parabolas plotted in the figures were selected using the automated parameter approximation method. Inspection of these plots reveals that they capture the time course of the cumulative number of cases fairly well (right panel of each figure and as depicted in panel 5 of the schematic of Fig. 1). For very noisy data (e.g. left panels of Figs. A3\u20135 for Ebola), the chosen parabola nicely interpolates through widely oscillating reported incidence data. The peak incidence (maximum of the blue solid curve on the left panel of each figure) is typically higher than the maximum M of each parabola (Figs. 2B, 4, A1\u2013A5) and may not occur at the same value of the cumulative number of cases. The time frame for the peak of the outbreak (that is when the cumulative curve shown on the right panel of each figure is the steepest), as well as the duration of the entire outbreak (when incidence returns to values close to zero) are however reasonably well captured.",

In particular, fluctuations in G (incidence) do not change the overall one- or two-hump behavior of the curve. To make this statement more quantitative, we assessed whether adding a small amount of noise (see Technical Appendix 5 in Supplementary Material for noise generation) to the data significantly affected the outcome of the automated parameter estimation procedure. Specifically, we found that the standard deviation of the distribution of estimates for the duration, peak incidence, and final number of cases (these quantities are defined in Technical Appendix 6 in Supplementary Material) obtained from the parabolic model optimized for each outbreak, rescaled to their respective means, was typically of a few percent (<3% in all cases; see Supplementary Table A1). As a consequence, the parabolic fits can be performed without specific knowledge of the exact nature of the noise present in the data (recall that G represents incidence). A surge in G may reflect an actual increase in the number of reported cases, or an improvement in the way the disease is diagnosed, or possibly an increase in the number of reported cases due to \u201cconcern bias\u201d (Doshi, 2009). Changes in G also occur when numbers of confirmed or suspected cases are retroactively updated by the relevant reporting agencies.

We believe this effect is likely due to the combination of an initial \u201cexponential-like\u201d spread due to the transportation/restaurant network (in this example the outbreak was linked to salsa at Mexican style restaurants (Behravesh et al., 2011)), followed by a public health response that effectively limits further spread of the disease.",

In this case, parabolas were fit to the epidemiological data for each country by hand, by plotting graphs similar to those in Fig. 2.

In this paper we built on that property and described a new tool, EpiGro, which performs well in forecasting the scope of an ongoing outbreak. We provided general hypotheses for when this approximation might be expected to be relevant, including its extension to vector-borne diseases. We also developed a method for automatically extracting parameters from epidemiological data, discussed its robustness, and explored its use for forecasting the duration, size, and time of peak incidence of an unfolding outbreak. The novelty of our approach is to simultaneously fit the available data to both incidence (plotted as a function of the cumulative number of cases) and cumulative number of cases (plotted as a function of time), rather than just fitting the observed number of cases, or attempting to estimate disease-specific transmission parameters from limited data. The only input necessary is the cumulative number of cases reported up to the time at which the forecast is made. While there is mounting evidence that a logistic model may be used for disease forecasting (Chowell et al., 2014, Pell et al., 2016), it is essential to have robust methods that identify optimal parameters. Technical Appendix 8 in Supplementary Material compares the present approach with a logistic fit of the cumulative epidemiological curve and illustrates similarities and differences between the two methods. Recent work (Pell et al., 2016) proposed to give more weight to recent data points in the calculation of the error to be minimized when fitting cumulative curves to solutions of the logistic equation, in order to improve the performance of a logistic fit. While the mathematics underlying the parabolic approximation is fairly simple, our results indicate that the present method can provide useful information on the order of magnitude of the scope of an outbreak, relatively early in its development, and that predictions generally improve as the disease unfolds and epidemiological data become more complete. Further work on the automated parameter estimation procedure is likely to lead to better outcomes, especially in the early stages of an outbreak. This however goes beyond the scope of the present article, whose main goal is to establish the presence of the parabolic behavior in outbreak data and to discuss the consequences of this observation, including its potential as a forecasting tool for emerging outbreaks.",

            "text": "From a modeling point of view, our main message is that for many single-wave outbreaks, including simulated deterministic outbreaks following the SIR model, the cumulative number of cases not surprisingly exhibits linear growth followed by quadratic nonlinear saturation and thus qualitatively behaves like a solution of the logistic equation (note that in that context C0, the total number of cases, represents the carrying capacity of the system and is typically denoted by K). The data-driven forecasting approach presented here builds on this realization and is able to quickly (in a few minutes on a standard CPU) provide order-of-magnitude estimates of the scope of an outbreak without knowledge of disease transmission information. In times of increasing model complexity, this reminds us that simple considerations may still be useful, especially in the absence of disease transmission parameters. We therefore suggest that the method discussed in this article could be included in the fleet of models that responders and planners use to rapidly address emerging infectious disease outbreaks.",

            "text": "Doing so would of course only address a small piece of the disease forecasting puzzle. Because the present approach is data-driven and macroscopic, it can only start making useful predictions once a significant number of cases have been reported. It also cannot capture the presence of local clusters which can affect the effective speed of disease transmission. However, if the goal is to describe the large-scale spread of an emerging disease at the macroscopic level, one could envision coupling this method to models for the prediction of disease arrival times in specific countries, as for instance described in (Brockmann and Helbing, 2013). Once the disease is predicted to arrive in a given location, one could use linear growth to estimate the initial number of cases and switch to the method proposed here after enough cases have been reported, in order to include nonlinear effects. Even though such a strategy may seem crude, it is likely to be fast, and based on the discussion presented in this article, it should be able to correctly predict the order of magnitude of many outbreaks.",
