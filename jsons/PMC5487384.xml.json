Dysregulation of this system is observed in several pathological conditions including cancer and viral infections (Weis, 2003; Hung and Link, 2011; Le Sage and Mouland, 2013). Chromosome Region Maintenance1 (CRM1), a nuclear transporter protein, mediates the export of around 220 proteins and mRNA across the nuclear envelope (NE), and is involved in regulation of processes involved with proliferation including cell cycle progression and apoptosis (Xu et al., 2012). CRM1 is a key protein overexpressed in several solid and hematological malignancies where mislocalization of tumor suppressor proteins promotes malignancy and tumor progression (Hung and Link, 2011). CRM1 is also utilized by viruses at various stages of their lifecycle to mislocalize cellular proteins as well as ensure appropriate localization of viral proteins (Le Sage and Mouland, 2013). Given that viruses of diverse families, e.g., retroviruses, DNA and RNA viruses exploit or modulate CRM1-mediated nuclear export, effective targeting of CRM1 would lead to a broadly effective drug potentially active against current and future virus infections.",

            "text": "Among the seven known nuclear export proteins in the Karyopherin family, CRM1 is the best characterized nuclear exporter. CRM1 is the sole nuclear exporter of several cellular growth and survival factors including proteins and RNA. CRM1-mediated transport mediates cell proliferation through several pathways (Figure 2). (i) The subcellular localization of NES-containing oncogenes and tumor suppressor proteins involved in regulating cell division, controlling apoptotic pathways, and maintain genomic integrity by recognizing and repairing DNA damage. Many of these regulatory proteins are mislocalized in a large variety of tumors (Turner et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2016). (ii) The control of mitotic apparatus and chromosome segregation through the regulated export of centrosome-associated proteins. For instance, inhibition of nucelophosmin by LMB results in its dissociation from centrosomes and premature centrosome duplication (Wang et al., 2005). BRCA1, a tumor suppressor protein commonly mutated in breast and ovarian cancer, stimulates DNA repair at the nucleus and inhibits centrosomal duplication in response to DNA damage (Arnaoutov et al., 2005; Nguyen et al., 2012). Disruption of CRM1-mediated export blocks the localization of BRCA1 at the centrosome and results in failure for cells to detect DNA damage (Brodie and Henderson, 2012). (iii) crm1 yeast mutants had altered chromosomal structures that appeared as rod-like thickened fibers suggesting a role for CRM1 in maintenance of chromosomal and nuclear structures (Toda et al., 1992). In addition, abnormal nuclear morphology and cell cycle arrest at both G1 and G2 phases were observed in leptomycin-treated yeast (Nishi et al., 1994). CRM1 levels remain constant throughout the cell cycle and it is mainly localized to the NE in highly specialized cellular bodies called CRM1 nuclear bodies (CNoBs) that depend on RNA polymerase1 activity, suggesting a role in ribosome biogenesis (Gravina et al., 2014).",

In a normal cell, APC chaperones \u03b2-catenin and promotes its CRM1-mediated export into the cytoplasm where \u03b2-catenin level is regulated by degradation. Mutations in APC gene cause malignant colon cancer and the intestinal polyp disorder familial adenomatous polyposis (Powell et al., 1992).

HIV Rev protein is a 19 kDa phosphoprotein that mediates controlled expression of 4 and 9 kb retroviral mRNAs (encoding the vif, vpr, and vpu/env genes and the gag/pol gene, respectively) in the nucleus (Najera et al., 1999; Fontoura et al., 2005). Rev protein carries an NLS peptide enabling translocation into the nucleus, an RRE-binding (Rev response element) domain that binds to the unspliced mRNA, as well as an \u201cactivation\u201d domain which contains the NES peptide which allows shuttling of the transcripts into the cytoplasm using CRM1-mediated export (Table 1; Kimura et al., 1996; Wolff et al., 1997; Najera et al., 1999; Urcuqui-Inchima et al., 2011). The binding of Rev to unspliced transcripts carrying the RRE creates an RNP filament with the NES displayed on the surface and provides a transient \u201ctag\u201d which directs to CRM1 (Najera et al., 1999).",

HTLV-1 genomic RNA encodes more than 10 viral proteins and has three alternatively-spliced forms of viral mRNAs that are unspliced (encodes Gag, Pro, and Pol proteins), singly (partially)-spliced (encodes Env) and doubly (fully)-spliced (encodes accessory proteins, such as Tax, Rex, P30II, p12, and p13). The viral mRNA from the provirus for the first round of transcription is completely spliced to tax/rex mRNA by the cellular splicing machinery.

Unlike the RRE in HIV-1 mRNAs, RxRE is in all HTLV-1 mRNAs but they differ in nuclear export efficiency by Rex (Nakano and Watanabe, 2016). Rex is indispensable for efficient viral replication, infection and spread since it is considered to regulate the switch between the latent and productive phases of the HTLV lifecycle (Younis and Green, 2005). Without a functional Rex, viral structural and enzymatic post-transcriptional gene expression would be severely repressed and lead to non-productive viral replication (Younis and Green, 2005).",

The replication cycle of orthomyxoviruses consist of attachment, receptor-mediated endocytosis followed by release of the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) in the cytoplasm. The vRNP is then imported into the nucleus where it undergoes transcription and replication. The newly formed vRNPs are exported to the plasma membrane to complete assembly of viral particles and budding (Knipe and Howley, 2013) The RNA genome of influenza virus encodes 11 viral proteins. The transmembrane proteins hemagglutinin, neuraminidase and M2 protein on the viral envelope assist in attachment and penetration, as well as M2 protein-mediated release of the vRNP into the cytoplasm. The vRNP consists of the (\u2212)ssRNA, three polymerase proteins (PB1, PB2, and PBA) that form the viral RNA polymerase complex (3P) and nucleoprotein (NP). Nuclear import of the vRNP is facilitated using importin-\u03b1 (Imp-\u03b1). Following transcription and replication in the nucleus, newly synthesized RNA is complexed with NP to form new vRNPs; reviewed in Nayak et al. (2004) and Boulo et al. (2007).",

This is a critical step for the formation of mature viral particles and is conserved in influenza A, B and C strains (Paragas et al., 2001; Paterson and Fodor, 2012). In addition to NEP, the viral matrix protein (M1) and NP also play important roles in this step. Absence of either protein results in retention of vRNPs in the nucleus (Bui et al., 2000; Neumann et al., 2000).

RSV consists of a nucleocapsid core, wherein the RNA genome is tightly encapsulated by nucleocapsid proteins and the viral polymerase complex, contained within a lipid bilayer envelope. RSV infection is initiated when the large glycoprotein G facilitates attachment of the virion to the host membrane followed by fusion of the viral envelope with the host membrane mediated by the viral F protein. The nucleocapsid core is then released into the cytoplasm where the virus-encoded polymerase complex formed by L and P proteins, direct the transcription of the (\u2212)ssRNA genome to generate the primary mRNA transcripts, which are then translated into viral proteins (Ghildyal et al., 2006, 2009). The Matrix (M) protein possesses both NLS and NES sequences that enable it to shuttle in and out of the nucleus in the early and late stages of infection using importin \u03b2 (Imp-\u03b2) and CRM1, respectively. At the early stages of viral replication [about 5\u20136 h post infection (h.p.i)], the newly-synthesized M protein translocates into the nucleus via the action of the nuclear transport protein Imp-\u03b2 and accumulates in the nucleus up to 16 h.p.i (Ghildyal et al., 2006, 2009; Bajorek et al., 2014).",

The N terminal domain of NS5 carries out two biochemically distinct methylation reactions for RNA capping and the C terminal domain has an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity required for synthesis of the viral genome in the cytoplasm; reviewed in Lim et al. (2015). DENV-2 NS5 possesses two NLSs that are capable of binding Imp-\u03b1/\u03b2 and Imp-\u03b2, respectively (Pryor et al., 2007). It also carries an NES sequence that interacts with CRM1 (Table 1; Pryor et al., 2006). The bidirectional transport of NS5 has been shown to be critical for modulation of host antiviral responses, particularly IL-8 induction, and viral replication. Inhibition of CRM1 in dengue virus type-2 infections resulted in nuclear accumulation of NS5, reduced IL-8 induction and altered viral replication kinetics (Pryor et al., 2006; Rawlinson et al., 2009).",

The nucleocytoplasmic localization of these P isoforms is dependent on the activity of the NES and NLS sequences located at the N- and C-terminals, respectively. P1 and P2 carry the dominant CRM1-dependent NES while P3\u2013P5 carry a truncated version of NES allowing NLS to become the primary localization signal. This results in P1 and P2 being localized in the cytoplasm while P3\u2013P5 are nuclear. (Table 1; Pasdeloup et al., 2005; Oksayan et al., 2012). NES of P protein is conserved throughout the Lyssavirus genus (Pasdeloup et al., 2005). P protein-mediated antagonism of interferon production in the host cell has been shown to play a major role in neuroinvasion and infection of peripheral nerves as it is essential for stable viral replication (Yamaoka et al., 2013). In normal cells, the phosphorylation of STAT1 enables it to localize in the nucleus and regulate gene expression. P protein inhibits the phosphorylation, nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity of STAT1 resulting in inhibition of both type I and II interferon responses (Vidy et al., 2007). In addition, P protein interferes with the phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) to retard interferon production (Brzozka et al., 2005). Thus, P protein interaction is critical to rabies pathogenicity. Interplay between the NLS and NES sequences on P protein in combination with the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the signal peptides regulate the localization of the viral protein (Gupta et al., 2000; Pasdeloup et al., 2005). The complex interaction of P protein with the host cell trafficking machinery ensures success of infection and suppression of host antiviral responses (Oksayan et al., 2012).",

Named after their characteristic icosahedral architecture, a typical herpesvirus consists of an outer envelope, tegument or matrix layers, and a capsid enclosed dsDNA genome (Knipe and Howley, 2013). Human cytomegalovirus, the largest member of the herpesvirus family, is the most significant cause of congenital disease. The virion is composed of a glycoprotein embedded host-derived envelope that encloses the tegument layer and the viral core composed of the icosahedral protein capsid and a dsDNA genome. Viral gene expression takes place in three stages: immediate-early, early and late stages. The tegument (or matrix) layer, lies beneath the envelope and above the viral capsid, is composed of nearly 32 proteins that conduct a range of functions including host cell response and orchestrating viral assembly. These matrix proteins are added to the nucleocapsid partly in the nucleus and partly in the cytoplasm during viral maturation. In the early stages of infection, tegument proteins associate with microtubules and the NPC to deliver the viral genome into the nucleus. In the final stages of infection these proteins coordinate stabilization of the nucleocapsid, trafficking from the nucleus, assembly at the plasma membrane and budding (Kalejta, 2008; Knipe and Howley, 2013).",

The lower matrix protein phosphoprotein 65 (pp65) is the most abundant tegument protein and a prominent target for MHC class I\u2013restricted CD8 and MHC class II CD4 T-cell responses (Frankenberg et al., 2012; Knipe and Howley, 2013). Pp65 localizes in the nucleus immediately after viral entry and carries out immune evasion tactics. Pp65 acts on two fronts, on one side it phosphorylates the viral immediate-early proteins and thereby protects them from being recognized by the host immune system (Gilbert et al., 1996). Pp65 also retards the expression of both MHC class 1 and II molecules thus crippling viral recognition by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Odeberg et al., 2003; Frankenberg et al., 2012). Pp65 also retards the host interferon response, particularly type 1 interferon response, reducing expression of interferon beta and other cytokines (Abate et al., 2004). Disruption of CRM1-medited export of pp65 resulted in its nuclear retention and decreased viral replication (Sanchez et al., 2007). During the lytic stage of the viral cycle, pp65 utilizes CRM1-mediated transport to shuttle into the cytoplasm (Table 1; Sanchez et al., 2007; Frankenberg et al., 2012). Another key function of pp65 is to inhibit natural killer cell cytotoxicity by directly binding to the activation receptor NKp30 (Arnon et al., 2005).",

It is a polyketide with a \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated d-lactone portion that covalently binds through Michael addition to the Cys528 in the CRM1 NES groove (or Cys529 in Saccharomyces pombe). Binding with LMB initially forces CRM1 to remain in a half open conformation. This is followed by hydrolysis of the lactone group of LMB in the presence of basic amino acid residues in the NES groove and thereby stabilizes the interaction making it irreversibly bound to CRM1 (Figure 3; Kudo et al., 1998). The persistent shutdown of CRM1 mediated nuclear export and off target activity are possibly the reasons why it is highly deleterious to the cell (Newlands et al., 1996; Fung and Chook, 2014; Perwitasari et al., 2014). LMB has been shown to block the export of influenza viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNP) containing the (\u2212)ssRNA genome, nucleoprotein and polymerases, from the nucleus into the cytoplasm and thereby inhibit influenza replication (Perwitasari et al., 2014). Table 1 lists some of the outcomes of LMB treatment in cells infected with selected viruses.",

They had better in vivo tolerance, up to 16-folds higher than LMB (Table 2). Although the NEIs cause inhibition of CRM1 in normal and tumor cell types, the downstream consequences of this inhibition are different to that of LMB, inducing cell cycle arrest (instead of apoptosis) in normal lung fibroblasts and apoptosis in p53 wild-type cancer models (HCT-116 colon model and SiHa cervical cancer) (Mutka et al., 2009). Topoisomerase II\u03b1 (topo II\u03b1) is a transcription factor that activates DNA-cleavable complexes and induces cell death. However, drug resistant myeloma cells mislocalize topo II\u03b1 to the cytoplasm using CRM1 nuclear export to escape apoptosis (Engel et al., 2004). KOS-2464 (Kosan Biosciences/Bristol-Myers Squibb), a semisynthetic NEI induces rapid and prolonged inhibition of CRM1, and apoptosis in drug resistant multiple myeloma cell lines at nanomolar concentrations (low IC50 value of 2 nM) without the toxicity associated with LMB (Turner et al., 2012b). Treated cells were found sensitive to topo II\u03b1 inhibitors while normal cells remained unaffected by the combined effects of CRM1 and topoII\u03b1 inhibition (Turner et al., 2009). In comparison to LMB, the absence of apoptosis despite cell cycle arrest by KOS2464 in normal lung fibroblasts is indicative of reduced off-target activity (Turner et al., 2012a).",

The compound induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner in both in vivo and in vitro models. In multiple myeloma cells, reduced NF-\u03baB activity due to CRM1-inhibition was found to be a key factor for the inhibitory effects of CBS9106 (Sakakibara et al., 2011). A commercially cost-effective derivative of CBS9106 designated S109 was also shown to reversibly inhibit CRM1-meidated nuclear export in renal cancer cells and reduce proliferation and colony formation. S109 down regulated the expression of cyclinD1, a nuclear protein that drives the G1 to S phase transition in the cell cycle, and induced the expression and accumulation of p53, p21, p27, and FOXO1. This resulted in cell cycle arrest at G1 phase in renal cancer cell lines (Liu et al., 2016).",

The smaller structure of SINEs in comparison to LMB (Table 2) translates as 40% occupancy of the NES groove leaving the remaining portion of the hydrophobic groove open and unoccupied. SINEs bind to CRM1 with their trifluoromethyl groups buried deep within the NES binding groove. Unlike LMB, SINEs are not hydrolyzed after conjugation probably due to its attachment deep into the NES groove protected from potential nucleophiles and oxyanions. The conjugation of KPT 185 to CRM1 and its inhibition activity is reversed by 40\u201360% after 24 h most likely due to a lack of the hydrolysis of its active enone group. The slow reversibility of SINEs possibly contributes to their improved tolerance since withdrawal of the drug allows deconjugation of the drug from CRM1 and essential nuclear export to resume in normal cells. They bind long enough to kill cancer cells but their reversible nature allows then to be released in time to spare normal cells (Sun et al., 2013; Fung and Chook, 2014; Dickmanns et al., 2015).",

Being similar in structure to LMB, ratjadones use the same molecular mechanism to inhibit CRM1 (Koster et al., 2003; Meissner et al., 2004). Drug resistant-human multiple myeloma cell lines became more sensitized after inhibition of CRM1-meidated nuclear export using ratjadone. They were more responsive to topoII\u03b1 inhibitors (such as doxorubicin and epoposide) and to anticancer drugs, such as topotectan (a topoisomerase inhibitor) and cis-platinum (a DNA cross linking agent) (Turner et al., 2009). Treatment with ratjadones has shown to inhibit cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest at G1 and an increase in size of the nuclei (indicative of effective block of nuclear export) (Burzlaff et al., 2003; Koster et al., 2003). Recently ratjadone A has been shown to exert anti-HIV activity in vitro in a dose-dependent manner at nanomolar concentrations. Its inhibitory effect occurs 12 h.p.i. and interferes with the formation of the CRM1-Rev-NES complex by binding to CRM1 but not to Rev (Fleta-Soriano et al., 2014).",

Suppression of constitutive NF-kB signal pathway (Aggarwal and Shishodia, 2004), myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD-2) (Gradisar et al., 2007), Akt/ mTOR (Beevers et al., 2009), and STAT3 signaling (Kim et al., 2003) have been suggested for the antitumorigenic effects of curcumin. Recently, CRM1 has been confirmed as one of the cellular targets directly interacting with curcumin. Curcumin was shown to covalently interact with CRM1 at Cys528, induce the nuclear retention of FOXO1 and upregulates the expression of p73 and p27 in HeLa cells. In addition, CRM1 modulation by curcumin downregulated the expression of proinflammatory proteins COX-2 and cyclin D1 in a dose-dependent manner (Niu et al., 2013).",

At low concentrations, endogenous 15d-PGJ2 exerts anti-inflammatory effects, promoting chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils, while at high concentrations it induces eosinophil apoptosis in a PPAR\u03b3-independent manner (Miwa et al., 2004; Ueki et al., 2007). Exogenous administration of 15d-PGJ2 has shown to have antiviral, antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory effects. 15d-PGJ2 promotes translocation of PPAR\u03b3 to the nucleus and activation of NF\u03baB/I\u03baB signaling pathway to mediate anti-inflammatory responses. Exogenous 15d-PGJ2 (Table 2) has been shown to interrupt CRM1-mediated nuclear export by interacting with CRM1 similar to LMB (Hilliard et al., 2010). In comparison to LMB higher concentrations of 15d-PGJ2 are required to inhibit CRM1 probably because its \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl group can only modify selected or exposed nucleophilic groups. However, this also enables targeted inhibition of a subset of proteins. 15d-PGJ2 and/or derivatives of this PG as a CRM1 inhibitor hold promise as therapeutic agents as it can be produced by higher eukaryotes and can therefore function as both endogenous and exogenous regulator of CRM1 mediated nuclear export (Hilliard et al., 2010).",

For instance, thymoquinone, the main constituent of the volatile oil from Nigella sativa (black cumin) seeds, is reported to protect laboratory animals against chemical toxicity and induction of carcinogenesis. Thymoquinone reacts in vitro with glutathione through a spontaneous and rapid reaction that produces a dihydrothymoquinone-thioether via 1,4-Michael addition mechanism, like LMB, thereby suggesting that thymoquinone may be capable of inhibiting CRM1 (Forouzanfar et al., 2014).",
