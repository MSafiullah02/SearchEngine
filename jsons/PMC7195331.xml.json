The national Spring Festival holiday was extended by 8 days to Feb 7, and most schools have remained closed to date. As the Spring Festival holiday ended, stringent social distancing measures and mobility restrictions were coordinated and implemented by the central and local governments in many Chinese megacities (ie, the largest and wealthiest; figure 1), including Beijing (north of Wuhan), Guangzhou and Shenzhen (south), Shanghai and Hangzhou (east), and Chengdu (west). For example, only residents were allowed to enter residential communities, face mask-wearing was made compulsory, and non-essential community services were shut down. Although the aggressive countermeasures appear to have reduced the number of reported cases, the absence of herd immunity against COVID-19 suggests that counts could easily resurge when these interventions are relaxed, as business, factory operations, and schools resume.",

On the other hand, COVID-19 has spread to more than 100 countries or regions, and local epidemics have been established in multiple countries, including the USA and most countries in Europe. On March 10, Italy, the worst-hit country outside China, with more than 10 000 cases, imposed a nationwide lockdown, which is expected to be in place until at least early April. Most countries in Europe have imposed stringent control measures to limit social contacts. As COVID-19 continues to spread globally, escalating case importation from overseas or residual infected seeds within China (despite the almost 2-month-long containment policy nationwide), coupled with the resumption of economic activities, a second wave of COVID-19 appears probable. Thus, we simulated the potential consequences of relaxing restrictions in anticipation of a recrudescence of infections.",

Wuhan has been locked down since Jan 23, 2020, with 16 of its neighbouring cities in Hubei province subsequently included behind the cordon sanitaire shortly thereafter. The national Spring Festival holiday was extended by 8 days to Feb 7, and, to date, most schools have remained closed. Although the aggressive countermeasures appear to have reduced the number of reported cases, the absence of herd immunity against COVID-19 suggests that case counts could easily resurge when these interventions are relaxed, as business, factory operations, and schools resume, given the increasing risk of viral reintroduction, particularly from overseas importation. We searched PubMed and preprint archives for articles published up to March 17, 2020, that contained information about the control measures against COVID-19 outbreak using the terms \u201ccoronavirus\u201d, \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d, \u201cCOVID-19\u201d, \u201ccontrol measures\u201d, \u201coutside Wuhan and/or Hubei\u201d, and \u201cChinese New Year\u201d. We found five studies that reported the estimates of the effects of control measures on COVID-19 transmission in Wuhan or Hubei, but no study focused on the regions outside Wuhan or Hubei.\nAdded value of this study\nIn regions outside Hubei, the instantaneous reproduction number (R\nt) of COVID-19 substantially decreased after aggressive control measures were implemented on Jan 23, 2020, and have since remained below 1. Control measures should be relaxed gradually so that the resulting R\nt would not sustainably exceed 1. Otherwise, the cumulative case count would increase exponentially with the relaxation duration. The confirmed case-fatality risk (cCFR) outside Hubei was 0\u00b798%, but varied substantially among different provinces, probably due to heterogeneity in regional economic development and availability of health-care resources.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nAlthough the first wave of COVID-19 in Chinese provinces outside Hubei has abated because of the aggressive non-pharmaceutical interventions, close monitoring of R\nt and cCFR is needed to inform strategies against a potential second wave, given the increasing risk of viral reintroduction from overseas importation.\n",

We collated publicly available information of each of these officially confirmed cases to construct the epidemic curve for Beijing4 and Shanghai,5 and a detailed line list for both Shenzhen6 and Wenzhou.7 The National Health Commission definition of a confirmed case is given in the table\n. We estimated R\nt and cCFRs in these cities based on the following data sources: (1) for Beijing and Shanghai, the daily number of confirmed cases with and without Wuhan or Hubei travel history were available from the Beijing and Shanghai Municipal Health Commission.4, 5 Dates of symptom onset were also available for 186 (88%) of 212 cases who were reported by Beijing before Feb 3, 2020. (2) For Shenzhen,6 we collected patient-level data, including age, sex, travel history (to Wuhan or Hubei with details), epidemiological links to confirmed cases (with details of their relationships, contact times, and events), residential district, date of exposure (for some cases), presenting symptomatology, dates of symptom onset, admission, confirmation, and discharge. (3) For Wenzhou,7 we were only able to collect patient-level data, including age, sex, travel history (yes or no to Wuhan or Hubei), epidemiological links to confirmed cases (yes or no), residential district, dates of symptom onset, and confirmation. (4) The time between dates of symptom onset (ie, serial interval) of 56 infector\u2013infectee pairs, among which six pairs were from Hubei published by Li and colleagues;8 14 pairs from secondary infections linked to exported cases outside mainland China; two and 23 pairs from the Zhuhai and Shenzhen line lists, respectively; and 11 from a family cluster in Jiangsu, reported by Huang and colleagues9 (appendix pp 7\u20139). (5) The delay between symptom onset and reporting were calculated for each case in both Shenzhen and Wenzhou. The onset date was not available for 225 (55%) of 411 cases in Beijing and any case in Shanghai. As such, we estimated the onset dates of these cases based on their date of reporting, and assuming that the time between onset and reporting was statistically the same as that of the 186 (45%) of 411 cases in Beijing whose onset dates were known. We used the date when each case was reported on the website of local health commissions as the reporting date. The empirical mean time from symptom onset to reporting was 4\u00b79 days (SD 3\u00b73) for Beijing, 7\u00b76 days (4\u00b72) for Shenzhen, and 6\u00b73 days (4\u00b74) for Wenzhou.

However, from Feb 7 onward, all four cities began to report imported cases from Hubei again, suggesting it might be a challenge to maintain subthreshold R\nt when economic activities fully resume in the presence of exponentially increasing case importation from locations with ongoing community transmission of COVID-19 (eg, Hubei domestically, and Italy, South Korea, or Iran internationally). The cumulative number of importations from overseas increased from 20 to 353 between March 4 and March 22; most of these importations were reported by megacities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. Containment measures based on isolation and contact tracing will eventually fail if case exportation continues to grow exponentially, which seems probable given that local transmission has already been established in many large countries, including the USA and most European countries.",

Once elevated at the higher level, it could only be pushed back down to the original baseline by extra effort, by driving R\nt down below unity. Therefore, relaxation of interventions to allow R\nt > 1 would probably incur both marginally higher health and economic loss, even if the disease prevalence could subsequently be pushed back to pre-relaxation level. Thus, proactively striking a balance between resuming economic activities and keeping R\nt below 1 is likely to be the optimal strategy until effective vaccines become widely available, despite the fact that control policies, including social distancing, behavioural change, and public awareness, will probably be maintained for some time.24\n",

In the conventional framework of inferring R\nt from epidemic curve data (as we have done), the lead time between actual changes in R\nt and the detection of such changes is roughly equal to the sum of the incubation period and reporting delay (although the latter could be adjusted for, as we have done). We postulate that such lead time might be shortened if reliable analytics could be developed to predict R\nt from digital proxies for social mixing and human mobility. Specifically, the resumption of economic activities and normal societal functions can be digitally monitored in various ways by the cloud platforms of Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent.25 As of March 10, the Alipay and WeChat Health Code system had been used more than 1\u00b76 billion times, and its usage patterns reflect the level of economic activities in real time.26 The decline in R\nt in the four selected cities correlated with the decrease in intracity traffic volumes recorded by Baidu (appendix p 6). Using the intracity traffic volume on Jan 1\u201315 as the index, to date, the level of economic activities of the four selected cities have been at half the normal pre-outbreak levels. Closely monitoring R\nt and such digital indices could enable finetuning of control measures to effectively minimise the potential adverse effects of a possible second wave of infections. Given the pivotal role of R\nt in epidemic control, we suggest that real-time estimates of R\nt should be presented in the routine COVID-19 dashboards and situation reports for provincial, national, and supranational health agencies.",

The cCFR was relatively low in south and east China, and substantially higher in the north and northwest, which also correlates with provincial per capita gross domestic product (appendix pp 4, 11). Prosperous regions, such as Jiangsu and Zhejiang, had the lowest cCFRs among provinces that had more than 500 confirmed cases, whereas less developed regions, such as Henan, Hebei, and Heilongjiang, had the highest cCFRs. Guangdong, the richest province in the country, has the largest number of migrant workers in China and thus a high proportion of imported cases of COVID-19 from Hubei.12 Guangdong's health-care system, with the second lowest number of hospital beds per 10 000 population, sustained an enormous stress to its surge capacity, which is perhaps reflected by its mid-level cCFR ranking. Similarly, for megacities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, and Shenzhen, the cCFRs ranked in the middle, despite their economic prosperity and relatively robust health-care infrastructure (appendix pp 5, 11). Although we did not have data on the proportion of hospital beds occupied during the first wave, given that there were fewer than 1000 confirmed cases in most cities and provinces (compared with approximately 123 600, 139 000, and 45 700 hospital beds overall in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, respectively), it was unlikely that the additional burden could have been overwhelming for the health systems outside Hubei.",

Although there might be less under-reporting and ascertainment bias in provinces outside Hubei, our work shows the fundamental importance of a regularly (preferably daily) updated and sufficiently detailed line list. Second, the estimation of R\nt relied on an accurate estimate of the serial interval distribution, where nearly half of the publicly available paired infector\u2013infectee data points are currently derived from Shenzhen (appendix pp 7\u20139). Third, travel history or epidemiological links to Hubei were another essential element, because the proportion of imported cases varied over time and across locations. Although most cases in Wenzhou were local cases since Feb 4, the majority of confirmed cases in Shenzhen consisted mostly of imported cases from Hubei even up until Feb 12\u2014more than 2 weeks after the Wuhan lockdown on Jan 23. Fourth, the simulations of intervention relaxation were done for a limited number of illustrative scenarios regarding temporal changes in the reproduction number.

A comprehensive database of all confirmed and probable cases in each superspreading event cluster will be essential to understand the transmission of superspreading events. Combining information on COVID-19 transmission in the superspreading events, households, and community would enable better understanding of the overall R\nt estimates, which would further enhance the effectiveness of control measures, if they are accordingly and precisely designed.",
