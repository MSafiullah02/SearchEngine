            "text": "Since December 2019, a respiratory pandemic named as coronavirus disease 2019 caused by a new coronavirus named as SARS-CoV-2, has taken the world by storm. The symptoms are fever, malaise, and cough which resolve in a few days in most cases; but may progress to respiratory distress and organ failure. Transmission is through droplet infection or fomites, but other modes such as airborne transmission and oro-fecal transmission are also speculated. Research is underway to develop effective vaccines and medicines for the disease. In such a scenario, we present the measures described in Unani system of medicine for health protection during epidemics. Unani is a traditional system of medicine developed during the middle ages, which employs natural drugs of herbal, animal and mineral origin for treatment. In Unani medicine, during an epidemic, apart from isolation and quarantine, three measures are of utmost importance, (i) purification of surroundings using certain herbal drugs as fumigants or sprays, (ii) health promotion and immune-modulation, and (iii) use of healthprotecting drugs and symptom-specific drugs. Drugs such as loban (Styrax benzoides W. G. Craib), sandroos (Hymenaea verrucosa Gaertn.) za'fran (Crocus sativus L.), vinegar etc. are prescribed in various forms. Scientific researches on these drugs reveal the presence of a number of pharmacologically active substances, which may provide a new insight into the management of infections and epidemics.",

It is now understood that SARS-CoV-2 has a 96.2% structural similarity with a bat coronavirus (CoV RaTG13) and 79.5% similarity with SARS-CoV. However, its spike (S) glycoprotein has a 10-20 times higher affinity to human ACE2 receptors as compared to SARS-CoV, leading to more chances of human-to-human transmission; though having a lesser mortality rate (average 3.4%) than that of SARS (9.6%) and MERS (35%) respectively (Guo et al., 2020) .",

In the absence of any proven treatment option, many drugs are under investigation to control this disease with a potentially fatal outcome. Chloroquine is one of the widely used drugs, with in vitro evidence that it reduces viral replication (Deponti et al., 2017) . A combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has also been found to have a significant synergistic effect in reducing viral load and early recovery (Gautret et al., 2020) . For severe disease, the use of steroids, passive antibodies, and selective cytokine blockade is suggested (Mehta et al., 2020) . The role of NSAIDs and corticosteroids, however, is still controversial and not advisable at present (Russell et al., 2020) . Antivirals such as interferon-\u03b1, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, etc. are also being used as a tentative treatment for Covid-19 (Dong et al., 2020 ). Yet, as of now, there are no specific antiviral drugs or vaccines verified to be effective against SARS-CoV-2, hence the emphasis is being laid on preventive measures and symptomatic treatment (Jean et al., 2020) .",

Although no direct evidence is available, some uncontrolled studies on traditional medicines suggest that they may have a direct efficacy on the virus. Unani medicine is one of the officially recognized traditional medicine systems of India, which are represented by the acronym AYUSH, i.e. Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (Weeks, 2020) . Unani, also sometimes referred to as the Greco-Arabian system of medicine originated with the teachings of Hippocrates and was improved and systematized by Arabian physicians. It was introduced into India during the 11th-13th century in the Mughal period (Subbarayappa, 2001) . Unani system of medicine has a detailed description of drugs that are utilized in many infectious diseases, including respiratory infections (Vohora, 1986) . Some of these drugs have been demonstrated to have specific antiviral (Cagno et al., 2015) and immunomodulatory (Nigar and Itrat, 2013) activity in various scientific studies. In this paper, we present an overview of Covid-19 and SARS-CoV-2, Unani concept of infectious and epidemic diseases and their preventive measures, and a possible approach to the management of Covid-19 with Unani medicine.",

The search words used were 'SARS-CoV-2', ' 'history', 'prevalence', 'symptoms', and 'transmission' . Internet search on the same search engines and also Google Scholar was also done to search for scientific evidence regarding Unani drugs prescribed during epidemics. For this search, we used the terms 'air purification', 'influenza', 'epidemic', 'immunomodulatory', and 'bioactive compounds' along with the names of drugs, according to their use. Time restriction was not made to extract the most useful information. The articles published during 2005-2020 were hence included in the final manuscript.",

It is the seventh in the family of coronaviruses which is known to infect humans (Andersen et al., 2020) . Coronaviruses are a group of enveloped viruses with a spherical shape, having a non-segmented, single-stranded RNA genome with club-like projecting spikes on their surface (Phan, 2020a) . SARS-CoV-2 was first isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage samples from three patients suffering from pneumonia of unidentified cause (Zhu et al., 2020) . Structurally, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to other \u03b2-coronaviruses. It has a long coding strand on which five ORFs are identified: including ORF1ab polyprotein, spike (S) glycoprotein, envelope protein, membrane protein, and nucleocapsid protein (Phan, 2020a) . The S glycoprotein is the primary target of antibodies and vaccines as it is surface-exposed (Walls et al., 2020) .",

Snakes have also been suggested as a likely wildlife repository of the virus. However, there was an exponential rise in unrelated cases since late December 2019 . Since bats are a natural reservoir of various coronaviruses, a zoonotic angle is not entirely ruled out.

About 50-80% transmission of the virus is from asymptomatic carriers, hence transmission through speech droplets is considered as a significant mode of transmission of the disease. The virus can be transmitted directly through speech droplets, or through fomites (Anfinrud et al., 2020) . Based on reports, it is estimated that 44% of the transmission can occur before the onset of symptoms (He et al., 2020) . SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptors, which are present in abundance in the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. Viral RNA has also been detected in feces. Hence, an oro-fecal route of transmission is also considered. Air-borne transmission is not completely ruled out (Ling et al., 2020) . There is also evidence that the virus can be transmitted through tears and body fluids if they come into contact with the mucosa of eyes, mouth or nose. Depending on the route of entry, the virus binds to ACE2 receptors and infects type-2 pneumocytes, ciliated bronchial epithelium of lungs (Rodriguez-Morales et al., 2020), or enterocytes of the small intestine. The virus has also been isolated in blood, indicting more routes of transmission (Guo et al., 2020) .",

For obvious reasons, the concept of microbes as disease-causing agents does not find a direct reference in Unani medicine. However, there is an adequate understanding that certain ajsam-i-khabitha (literally translated as 'bad substances') can migrate from the diseased to healthy persons, and may cause diseases (Sina, 1878) . This theory of contagion is advocated by a number of Unani scholars. According to Jalinoos (Latinized as Galen, , 'a physician should always keep an eye on changes of weather and air' (Qadeer, 2001) . A treatise of Zakariya Razi (865-925 CE), Kitab fi al-jadari wa-al-hasbah (Book on Smallpox and Measles) describes the modes of spread of the two diseases and their differential diagnosis. In May 1970, it was regarded as \"the first scientific treatise on the subject\" by WHO (Islam, 2018) . According to Ibn Sina (980-1035 CE), 'air and water are contaminated only after admixture of ajsam-i-khabitha, which does not happen otherwise'. He further states, 'such contamination can also be brought about if the dead bodies of people dying due to an epidemic are not disposed of properly' (Sina, 1878). Evidently, he had knowledge of microbes being present in the body even after death, which could potentially infect others.",

As Ibn Hubal Baghdadi (1121-1213 CE) mentioned in his treatise Kitab al-Mukhtarat fil-Tib (The Book on Choice of Medicine), if southern winds are replaced by northern winds, then catarrhal illnesses will occur in abundance (Baghdadi, 2004) .

Also, we could not find any clinical trials on the health effects of herbal fumigants.

Just when we thought we had conquered microbes (Adedeji, 2016; Mohr, 2016) , three viruses, belonging to a family hitherto considered less virulent, took the 21st century by storm (\u010civljak et al., 2020) . The newest of them, SARS-CoV-2, is, fortunately, lesser on virulence than its two recent predecessors, namely SARS-CoV and MERS, but higher in infectivity (Vellingiri et al., 2020) . This simply implies that it has more chances of reaching the susceptible population and causing higher mortality. There is also speculation that close to two-thirds of Covid-19 cases from China may have gone undetected (Menkir et al., 2020) . Going by the present trends, the cases are likely to increase in the near future (Vellingiri et al., 2020) . This is going to place a huge economic burden, especially on developing and under-developed countries (McKibbin and Fernando, 2020) .",

Concepts of sanitation, isolation, air purification and immune-modulation described in Unani medicine remain the basic tenets of infection containment in the contemporary preventive medicine (Chinazzi et al., 2020) . This necessitates a keen observation to uncover more treasure of knowledge from this ancient medicine system. Presently, in the absence of any decisive treatment available for Covid-19, stress is being laid on traditional medicine systems for providing the necessary protection (Vellingiri et al., 2020) . Herbal medicines have several bioactive compounds such as phenols, vitamins, several antioxidants, etc. with important pharmacological activity. Hence they can play a significant role in reducing the disease burden in the contemporary world (J. Kim et al., 2016; Zeinali et al., 2019) .",

Although at some places epidemics involving food and water-borne diseases, and plague, etc. have also been discussed (Razi, 2008; Sina, 1878) , but most of the literature is dedicated to air-borne diseases which affect the respiratory system. It is possible because the most prevalent epidemics in the Muslim world during the medieval ages were plague, smallpox, chickenpox, etc. which are transmitted through fomites or respiratory route (Islam, 2018) . The methods of air purification, and the drugs prescribed for the same (Table 1 ) e.g. Vinegar, Rosewater, fumigation with various resins such as loban, etc. are extremely noteworthy (Razi, 1991) . Convincing scientific evidence is present which advocates the air-purifying activity of most of these drugs (J. Kim et al., 2016) .",
