A non-infectious etiology was found for 8% of cases, and no etiology was found for 63% of cases. In the same study, 120 (8%) of a total of 1570 patients had multifocal white matter lesions noted on neuroimaging, consistent with a post-infectious disease process.12 The aim of this article is to describe characteristics of these severe post-infectious CNS disorders and to offer an update on their management.",

For some authors, the diagnosis of ADEM has to be debated if MRI shows no abnormality.14 MRI lesions are identified on morphological T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences. Although no specific MRI criteria have been identified, 4 MRI lesion patterns are generally recognized, but in all cases lesions are multifocal and involve mainly the supratentorial white matter: (1) multifocal lesions of less than 5 cm, (2) confluent multifocal lesions of more than 5 cm, (3) multifocal lesions involving basal ganglia, and (4) multifocal hemorrhagic and oedematous lesions in the Weston Hurst disease.17 Although patchy areas of increased signal intensity are stated to involve 50% or more of total white matter in children,11, 18 no lesion volume has been proposed in adult ADEM patients. ADEM lesions in such patients are typically large, multiple, and asymmetric. Severe and extensive T2 lesions usually contrast with a relatively small mass effect. The distribution of lesions involves the subcortical and central white matter and cortical gray\u2013white junction of both cerebral hemispheres and infratentorial areas.16 A pattern of diffuse demyelination can be seen in the most severe cases in adults with large demyelinating lesions of the white matter extending to the corpus callosum and to the contralateral hemisphere (Fig. 1\n).3, 14, 16\n",

The disease is fulminant and the mortality can be as high as 70%, leaving survivors with significant sequelae.26 CSF analysis at onset shows pleocytosis and elevated red blood cell count. MRI lesions are consistent with hyperintensities of the white matter which are widespread in both hemispheres, with relative sparing of gray matter. In AHLE the diffuse white matter lesions are more often non-enhancing but accompanied by evidence of cerebral oedema and haemorrhage.27 Large bihemispheric areas of demyelination with petechial hemorrhages can be seen on T2*-weighted sequences in the peripheral white matter.28 The neuropathology of AHLE consists in fibrinoid necrosis of veins and arterioles, accompanied by exsudates in the perivascular area with intense polymorphonuclear cell infiltration. White matter analysis shows myelin loss and relative preservation of axons. Some authors reported the benefice of early aggressive therapy in AHLE, with both surgical management of raised intracranial pressure and immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide.29\n",
