The median duration of intubation was 12 days. The patients with COVID-19 transferred to local hospitals during the outbreak had severe conditions and needed close monitoring.

The cruise started on January 20, 2020, from Yokohama stopped at Kagoshima (Southern Japan), Hong Kong, Da Nan and Chan May who were confirmed or suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 were kept isolated on the cruise ship, and they were allowed to disembark from the cruise ship only after the quarantine observation for two weeks. Disembark of 3711 individuals on the cruise ship was completed on March 1. Meanwhile, individuals who required medical care, mainly those with severe symptoms during February 3 and March 1, were transferred to local hospitals near the Yokohama city area, which is the largest city in the Kanagawa Prefecture for medical care [3] .",

Case report forms were collected on March 11 and March 19, 2020. The clinical findings of the patients without pneumonia were compared with those of the patients with pneumonia. The patient race was determined based on the estimation of his/her ancestor by each participating physician. Patient severity was defined according to World Health Organization criteria [4] . No patient was excluded because of bacterial or any other type of viral pneumonia by additional laboratory tests and sputum culture. Table 2 . Ceftriaxone and azithromycin were mostly chosen as the antibiotics for the initial treatment. With regard to the anti-viral drugs, the following neuraminidase inhibitors were administered in 14 patients: oseltamivir (n = 6), peramivir (n = 4), baloxavir (n = 1), and a combination of oseltamivir and baloxavir (n = 3). LPV/r was administered to 24 patients. Two patients with pneumonia were treated with a combination of neuraminidase inhibitors, LPV/r, and ribavirin. In addition, ciclesonide inhalation, which was suggested to have anti-coronavirus activity, was administered in 8 patients with pneumonia. Notably, the severity of this disease in the patients transferred from the cruise ship was very high compared with that previously reported in the general population in China [5, 6] .",

The findings of our study show that it is critical to differentiate patients with pneumonia from those without pneumonia to predict their clinical course and treatment plan. High LDH and AST levels possibly reflect the interstitial lung inflammation due to COVID-19. Low lymphocyte count and high LDH level were considered key to predict pneumonia in patients with COVID-19 because their levels serve as predictors of severe conditions [9] . The bilateral GGOs was helpful for diagnosing COVID-19. Chest CT is more sensitive than chest radiographs, and the bilateral GGOs in the lower lung lobes are reported to be specific to COVID-19 [10, 11] . We suggest that chest CT should be considered if a patient is suspected to have pneumonia due to COVID-19 but PCR findings were still under examination. No treatment regimen has yet been established for the treatment of COVID-19. In the participating hospitals, unapproved drugs were used for the treatment. Treatment with LPV/r, neuraminidase inhibitors, ciclesonide inhalation, favipiravir and rivabirin were attempted. Our colleagues reported that ciclesonide inhalation is effective for the treatment of COVID-19 [13, 14] .",

The diagnosis and treatment were depended on the clinical decision of each physician. Second, this study was descriptive and we did not properly evaluate the efficacies of the drugs or the supportive care. Further studies should be performed to assess the efficacy of these drugs for the treatment of severe cases of COVID-19. Third, we were not able to investigate all cases of COVID-19 on the Diamond Princess cruise. The environment inside the cruise ship is suitable for high transmission of respiratory infections [8] . Because individuals with severe conditions during an outbreak are possibly transferred to nearby local hospitals, managing patients during an outbreak is a big challenge to local medical systems. We believe that our findings of patients with COVID-19 during its outbreak on a cruise ship can help to manage a large number of patients infected within a short period of time. Assessment of disease severity was crucial to manage a large number of patients.",

This study was approved by the ethics committees at the Yokohama City University Hospital (approval number: B200200047) and the participating hospitals.Continuous data were presented as medians, and interquartile ranges were presented as (Q1-Q3). Categorical data were presented as numbers and percentages. Data were analyzed using a two-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test for comparisons of continuous variables among two or three groups and by Fisher's exact test for comparisons of categorical data. Statistical analyses wereperformed with Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). P-values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Seventy patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 were included in our study. The dates of onset of COVID-19 in these patients are summarized in Figure 1 (date of onset among six patients were missing). The predisposing conditions, general status, vital signs at admission, and laboratory data are shown in Table 1. The median age of the patients was 67 years; 67.1% of the patients were males, and 80% of the patients were Asians. The predisposing conditions were diabetes (24.3%) and hypertension (22.9%). Very few patients had active malignancy and renal failure. No one had HIV infections and liver dysfunction. The major symptoms of all the 70 patients were fever (64.3%), cough (54.3%), and general fatigue (24.3%). The median duration from onset of COVID-19 to admission was 4 days (2-6 days). Patients with pneumonia had significantly higher body temperatures than those without pneumonia (37.7\u00b0C vs. 36.7\u00b0C, P < 0.001). Heart rates (88 vs. 78/min) and respiratory rates (20 vs. 16/min) were significantly higher in the patients with pneumonia. Further, 14.3% of the patients with or without pneumonia required supplemental oxygen at the time of admission. Laboratory data taken at admission showed that the serum albumin levels were lower in patients with pneumonia than in those without pneumonia (3.9 vs. 4.2 g/dL), whereas the levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (265 vs. 206 U/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (36 vs. 26 U/L) were significantly higher in the patients with pneumonia than in those without pneumonia. The peripheral lymphocyte count was significantly lower in the patients with pneumonia than in those without pneumonia (957 vs. 1461/\u00b5L). C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were significantly higher in the patients with pneumonia than in those without pneumonia (3.7 vs. 0.4 mg/dL). Among the 43 patients with pneumonia, consolidation on chest CT was found in 27.9% and ground-glass opacity (GGO) was found in 97.7% of the patients with pneumonia. Notably, GGOs were bilateral (93.0%), multifocal (74.4%), and peripheral dominant (90.7%).Regarding treatments and clinical courses, the median observation period was 16 days (12-21 days) among all cases included in this study. Forty-one (58.6%) patients including 34 with pneumonia and 7 without pneumonia were administered antibiotics. The selected antibiotics are shown in",

The two patients who underwent V-V ECMO were both alive at the end of the observation period: one patient was successfully extubated on the day 13 of ventilation and the other had been intubated for 23 days using V-V ECMO. Three patients with pneumonia remained intubated for 19 to 25 days on the mechanical ventilator at the time of end of observation. The remaining 7 patients were successfully extubated after a median of 12 days (6-18 days) on mechanical ventilation. The median duration of hospital admission was 18 days (16-20 days) in 48 patients who were discharged from hospitals during the study period. The median duration between the first positive PCR result and the first negative PCR confirmation was 15 days (10-18 days).",
