Most effective of these are the mechanical barriers provided by the skin and mucosal surfaces, as well as the chemically hostile environment of the gut (Fig. 27.1\n). A number of common human viral pathogens enter through the gastrointestinal tract, including rotavirus, enteric adenoviruses, and hepatitis A virus (HAV). These are usually spread via person-to-person contact or contaminated food and water. Respiratory infections caused by influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, measles virus, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are often spread by aerosol transmission, as well as person-to-person contact. Many of the herpes viruses target the skin or the mucosae, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) and VZV. HSV in particular can infect oral and genital mucosa, the eye, and the skin through small cuts and abrasions. Other herpes viruses, such as Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), target the mucosa. CMV can also spread vertically from mother to baby or rarely via blood transfusions. Human papillomavirus (HPV) targets skin and muscosa and causes warts and may transform cells, inducing cancers such as cervical cancer. Viruses such as West Nile virus and Semliki forest virus may also enter through the skin via insect vectors. HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) are commonly spread via sexual contact. HIV, HBV, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) can also infect humans via direct entry into the bloodstream via transfusions or contaminated needles.",

            "text": "Most human viruses replicate only in certain target tissues, this being mainly the consequence of viral receptor distribution. Many viruses use two receptors, such as the use of the CD4 co-receptor and CCR5 by HIV. After attachment to a cellular receptor, viruses may fuse with the cell membrane or be endocytosed and then gain entry into the cytoplasm or nucleus by fusing with the vesicular membrane (enveloped viruses such as HSV and HIV), or translocate across the cell membrane or induce lysis of the endocytic vesicle once in the cytoplasm (nonenveloped viruses such as Norwalk virus and poliovirus).1 Viruses then utilize host cell machinery and specialized virally encoded proteins to replicate rapidly within the cell. Once they have multiplied within the cell, many viruses induce cytolysis in order to facilitate release of new infectious virions (the poxviruses, poliovirus, and herpes viruses, for example). Other viruses are released from infected cells by budding through the cell membrane in the absence of cell death (i.e., HIV and influenza virus). Having entered the body, however, viruses encounter numerous innate defenses and activate the components of adaptive immunity. The latter usually assures that clinical disease, if not infection, will not become evident. Successful exploitation of these defenses through the use of vaccines remains a central challenge for many human viruses, particularly those that cause chronic infections such as HIV and HCV.2\n",

            "text": "Viral infection induces an extensive array of defense mechanisms in the host. Innate defenses come into play to block or inhibit initial infection, to protect cells from infection, or to eliminate virus-infected cells, and occur well before the onset of adaptive immunity (Chapter 3). The innate immune defenses are initiated via pathogen recognition receptors of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family or a family of DExD/H box RNA helicases (Table 27.2\n).3 These cellular sensors promote the expression of type I (\u03b1/\u03b2) interferons (IFN) and a variety of IFN-stimulated genes and inflammatory cytokines.4 TLRs are cell surface or endosomal membrane-bound proteins expressed by numerous cells including dendritic cells (DC), macrophages, lymphocytes, and parenchymal cells.5 Expression of TLRs is largely inducible in most cell types, though some (TLR7/8/9) are constitutively expressed at high levels by specialized plasmacytoid DC for rapid IFN production. Different TLR molecules recognize specific viral products such as single- and double-stranded RNA (TLR 3 and TLR7/8, respectively) or double-stranded DNA (TLR9). The more recently described non-TLR RNA helicases, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene (MDA-5), mediate cytoplasmic recognition of viruses.6 It is thought that other cytoplasmic sensors of viruses are also likely to exist such as the recently discovered cytosolic dsDNA sensor DAI (DNA-dependent activator of IFN).",

NK cells are regulated by an array of activating and inhibitory receptors whose expression and function are just beginning to be understood.7 Uninfected cells are usually protected from NK cell cytolysis as they deliver negative signals such as high expression of MHC molecules. In contrast, virus-infected cells are killed either because they deliver positive signals or because they lack adequate MHC-negative signals. The NK defense system appears important against some herpes viruses, which downregulate MHC expression in the cells they infect. NK cells are also important in resistence to mouse and human cytomegalovirus, and possibly to HIV, influenza virus, and Ebola viruses.8 A distinct NK cell population, NKT cells, may provide some antigen-specific innate immune protection against certain viruses.

These include natural antibody, which may play a role in defense against some virus infections, as well as the complement proteins (Chapter 20). Some viruses may be directly inactivated by complement activation or be destroyed by phagocytic cells that bind and ingest complement-bound virions. Several cytokines and chemokines induced by virus infection also play a role in defense. These include the cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-12, IL-6, and chemokines such as MIP-1\u03b1. In particular, IL-12 is a potent inducer of IFN-\u03b3 from NK cells (Chapter 10). Inflammatory chemokines may also play an important role in innate antiviral defense by orchestrating macrophage, neutrophil, DC, and NK responses at the site of infection9 (Chapter 11). Not only are these components of innate immunity involved in mediating initial protection against viruses, several components (such as the TLRs and type I IFN and IL-12) serve to shape the nature and effectiveness of the subsequent adaptive response to viral antigens.",

The two major divisions of adaptive immunity, antibody and T-cell-mediated, are mainly directed at different targets. Antibodies usually function by binding to free viral particles, and in so doing block infection of the host cell. In contrast, T cells act principally by recognizing and destroying virus-infected cells. As all viruses replicate within cells and many of them spread directly between cells without re-entering the extracellular environment, resolution of infection is reliant more on T-cell function than on antibody. Antiviral antibody, however, does assume considerably more importance as an additional immunoprotective barrier against reinfection. It is the presence of antibody at portals of entry \u2013 most often mucosal surfaces \u2013 that is of particular relevance to influenza and HIV infections. Accordingly, vaccinologists try to design vaccines that optimally induce mucosal antibody.",

Specific CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) precursors recognize antigen in the context of MHC class I\u2013peptide antigen complexes on professional APC, such as DC. The CD8 T cells become activated, proliferate, and differentiate into effectors. Expansion of these na\u00efve antigen-specific precursors is considerable, often exceeding 10 000-fold, and results in an effector population that can account for 40% or more of a host's total CD8 T-cell population (Fig. 27.2\n). Various factors, including antigen and APC, co-stimulatory molecules (such as CD28 and 4-1BB) and inflammatory cytokines (such as IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IL-12) are required to program the development of functional effector lymphocytes.16 The CTL effectors enter the efferent lymph and bloodstream and access almost all body locations, including both primary and subsequent sites of infection. However, effectors do not stay activated for long once the virus is cleared, and approximately 95% die by a process termed activation-induced cell death. Following this contraction phase, the remaining cells differentiate into memory cells, which remain as a more or less stable population in the host for many years. They represent an expanded pool of CTL precursors that can be activated upon secondary encounter with antigen, and provide enhanced protection upon reinfection with the same virus. The topic of memory and homeostasis as it relates to antiviral immunity is further discussed later in this chapter.",

First, the subset acts as helper cells for the induction of both antiviral antibodies and CD8 T-cell responses to most virus antigens.11., 21. CD4 T cells also function as antiviral effector cells, and generate stable memory cell populations similar to those of CD8 T cells.22 The differentiation of CD4 T cells into effectors occurs in a manner very similar to that with CD8 T cells. At present less is known about the size and specificity of CD4 T-cell responses, but reports indicate that CD4 T cells undergo less expansion during virus infections, resulting in an effector pool smaller than that observed with CD8 T cells. CD4 T cells are activated by recognizing viral peptides. However, these are larger than those involved in CD8 T-cell recognition and are associated with class II MHC molecules present on more specialized cells such as APC (Chapter 6). Thus, CD4 T cells rarely recognize viral epitopes present on cells as a consequence of viral gene expression within that cell, dictating their function as helper cells for B cells and CD8 T cells, and as producers of cytokines for help and viral clearance.",

The type most often involved in antiviral defense are designated T-helper 1 (Th1) cells, and primarily produce IFN-\u03b3, LT\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-2 to help orchestrate the inflammatory response and act directly or indirectly in antiviral defense. Conversely, Th2 effectors produce an array of cytokines that may downregulate the protective function of Th1 cells, such as IL-4, IL-5, and two anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2). Th2 T cells play a protective function against some parasite infections (Chapter 29), though in some virus infections an exuberant Th2 response may be associated with immunopathology or impaired immunity. Indeed, blocking the Th2 cytokine IL-10 was recently shown to assist in the clearance of chronic viral infection. Additionally, an IL-17-producing subset of effector CD4 T cells has also been described (Th17), with potential roles in immune pathogenesis.23\n",

Humoral memory to viruses involves long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow that provide a continuous low-level source of serum antibody.26 This maintenance of humoral immunity also involves a population of homeostatically maintained memory B cells. However, the precise relationship between memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells in maintaining humoral immunity is uncertain. The pool of memory T cells is regulated by low-level homeostatic division controlled by the cytokines IL-7 and IL-15.

These include chronic infections such as HIV, HCV, HBV, and human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), among others.38 Such viral infections are marked by high levels of persisting antigen and can result in skewed T-cell immunodominance hierarchies, altered tissue localization of immune cells, and severely impaired T-cell function. This altered T-cell function is hierarchical and appears to correlate directly with antigen levels, resulting in functional T-cell defects ranging from reduced cytokine production and altered proliferative capacity (exhaustion) to death (deletion) of the responding T cells38 (Fig. 27.3\n). This is in stark contrast to normal memory T-cell development which occurs in the absence of persisting antigen (see previous section). Recent studies have demonstrated that signaling through programmed death (PD)-1 on effector CTL causes exhaustion during chronic infections.39 This pathway may be essential for preventing excessive immunopathology by effector T cells, yet appears to contribute directly to failed immunity to HIV infection,40 and other chronic human viral infections.39 These studies implicate this pathway as a potential therapeutic target.",

Chronic tissue damage initiated by viruses may also result in the response becoming autoreactive. Accordingly, some autoimmune diseases may be initiated or exacerbated by virus infections, although this notion has yet to be proved in the case of any human autoimmune disease.42 Circumstantial evidence exists for a virus link in multiple sclerosis (MS), insulin-dependent diabetes, and possibly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In MS, many viruses have been isolated from patients, though no specific one tied to the disease.

The first virus-induced immunopathology lesion recognized was glomerulonephritis and arteritis, noted in mice persistently infected with LCMV. The lesions were assumed to represent inflammatory reactions to tissue-entrapped immune complexes that activate complement. Similar immune complex-mediated lesions occur in other infections, but rarely have viral antigens been shown to contribute to the antigen component of the complex. An example where the inclusion of viral antigen in immune complexes has been demonstrated is chronic hepatitis B virus infection of humans. Autoimmune diseases such as SLE and rheumatoid arthritis also result from immune complex-mediated tissue damage.

CD8 T-cell-mediated immunopathology is also a likely explanation for acute hepatitis caused by some other hepatitis virus strains. The mechanisms involved in hepatitis B infection have been carefully analyzed in a mouse model in which the whole HBV was expressed as a transgene.43 In this model, CD8 cells organized the immunopathology reaction, but the process appeared complex. Initially, CTL-mediated cell killing events occurred, but since hepatocytes die by apoptosis it was not clear how this related to subsequent inflammatory events. However, the CD8 T cells also released numerous cytokines and chemokines that recruited inflammatory cells, primary macrophages. Interestingly, liver-infiltrating CTL have been shown to be inhibited by PD-1\u2013PD-L1 interactions, which may greatly reduce the severity of local immunopathology.44\n",

Recall responses induce a larger effector pool and reduced contraction further boosting the memory pool. (B) Effector and memory T-cell differentiation.
