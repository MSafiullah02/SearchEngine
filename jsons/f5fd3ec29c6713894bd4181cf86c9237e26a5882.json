Laboratory-based surveillance and use of cell phone surveillance may be a useful method. Material and method: We established a new model for gathering data directly from district laboratories to regional laboratories and from them to national manager of public health laboratories by using cell phone. We assessed the coverage of Mobile and Cell phone in the laboratory Technicians, and Directors of Public Health in 27 universities in Iran by a simple data collection form to evaluate the feasibility of this method.

In the Cholera epidemic in Iran in summer 2005, CDC of MOH registered near 900 cases of cholera from 70000 rectal soap\u00d5s exam in whole of country. The median reporting interval was under one day. Conclusion: Although the advent of the cell phone will probably change the way in which surveillance is delivered by health system, further studies are warranted to evaluate this method for laboratory based surveillance of lethal infections.",

Each Health Centers, Hospitals or Clinics report all cases of communicable diseases in one day of month according to a data collection form. Telephonebased health information service is used only for some epidemic diseases such as Cholera, Meningitis, Measles, Poliomyelitis, Tetanus, and etc [11] . The passive reporting system is not efficient and also not exact [22] . Existing reporting systems may identify outbreaks, but the incidence rates are far from accurate for example; 8110 new smear positive pulmonary TB had been registered by using this system in 2002 [33] but WHO estimated DOTS Case Detection rate was 60% in Iran in 2002 [44] . The median reporting interval (the time from the onset of disease to transmission of the case report to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) was at least 2 months (range, 1-6 months) [55] . Efforts to improve surveillance of communicable diseases had been started in Iran, one of these efforts is labora-tory-based reporting and the use of currently available computer telecommunication systems, which had been developed as a pilot study in Isfahan province in 2004 [66] .",

The director of the regional laboratory collects all data from districts levels and after analyzing, they send information to director of public health laboratories at the national level. The national levels do the data processing, even in some cases quality control will be done by reference laboratory. After that they disseminate the information to health workers and field epidemiologist and laboratories in whole of country as a feedback and to public health authorities and policy makers as a feed forward by SMS too.

Discussion SMS penetrating rate among Directors of Laboratory Technicians is very low (29.9%). But according to the Public affair of Iranian Telecommunication\u00d5s report [88], there are over 7 million users in the end of September 2005 and the mobile penetration rate is 10.5%, International Rooming Telecommunication had been provided between Iran and 43 countries. SMS users are 1.65 millions. According to 4 th development goal, it will increase up to 36 million mobile until 2009.There are many reports about the efficacy of telecommunication with mobile for diseases management and controls.The feasibility of remote management of extremity wound by using a mobile camera phone to transfer clinical images and online communication, teleconsultations were carried out on 60 patients between January and August 2003 for 82 extremity wounds presented to the emergency room between residents and consultant plastic surgeons. The preliminary results of this study showed that the camera phone is valuable and bears potential for remote management of the extremity wound[99].To evaluate the accessibility and use of new communication technologies in a population of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus attending the Diabetes Clinic of the Hospital de Sabadell, Sabadell, Spain, in a 6-month period were asked to answer a structured questionnaire about education level, Internet accessibility, use of healthrelated Web sites, and mobile-phone ownership and use. They concluded the impact of new communication technologies might be jeopardized by the low rate of access and utilization of the Internet for health-related purposes. Because of their high rate of ownership and use, mobile phones show promise as a tool in health care communication technologies[1010].",
