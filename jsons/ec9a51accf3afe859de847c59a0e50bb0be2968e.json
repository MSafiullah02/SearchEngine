A terminal-sequence-dependent cloning strategy was used to clone the entire genome of the CV17 strain. Full-length y cDNA clones were obtained when oligonucleotides specific for the 5'4erminal sequence of RNA (Y were used in the cloning procedure, but not when RNA r-specific oligonucleotides were used. Sequence analysis of six putative y cDNA clones revealed that nucleotides l-70 possess 89% homology with the first 70 nucleotides of RNA (Y. This leader region is separated from the -r-specific coding region by an eight-base intervening sequence common to both CV17 RNAs (Y and y. Northern and Southern hybridization with oligonucleotide probes specific for either 01 or y leader sequences indicated that CV17 y cDNA clones are representative of native CV17 y RNAs. Furthermore, bioassays indicated that in vitro transcripts derived from these y cDNA clones were infectious when coinoculated with in vitro transcripts of full-length (Y and /3 cDNA clones. Thus, the evidence suggests that RNA y of BSMV strain CV17 is a recombinant molecule which may have arisen as a result of natural recombination between RNAs (Y and y.",

Virion RNA was extracted using a phenol-SDS procedure and was subsequently recovered by ethanol precipitation, followed by 3 A.4 sodium acetate precipitation, and finally by ethanol precipitation again (7). This mixture of RNAs (Y, p, and y was then used for cDNA synthesis and cloning as previously described for the ND1 8 and Type strains of BSMV (7). Briefly, linearized single-stranded phagemid DNA with a T7 promoter sequence at its 5'-end and a short 3'-terminal sequence complementary to the 3'-end of BSMV RNA was used as a primer for firststrand cDNA synthesis. Phagemid-linked full-length cDNA was then circularized by annealing to a bandaid oligonucleotide with sequence complementary to both ends of the phagemid:cDNA. The use of three different bandaid oligonucleotides, each with 5'-ends complementary to the T7 promoter sequence and with 3'-ends complementary to the 5'-ends of either full-length (Y, p, or y cDNAs, provided a means of isolating specific fulllength cDNA clones in a single cloning operation with- out the need for prior separation of the (Y, 0, and y RNAs. Full-length clones were initially identified by colony color and gel electrophoresis of ssDNA obtained after superinfection of transformed Escherichia co/i strain DH5aF' with bacteriophage Ml 3K07, as described previously (7). The full-length nature of individual clones and the integrity of the T7 promoter/BSMV 5'-end junction were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing of ssDNA templates (10).",

Considering the high degree of sequence conservation among BSMV strains (e.g., the (Y leader sequences of the Type and CV17 strains differ by only 1 nt), the sequence divergence between the CV17 (Y and y leaders may be due to selection for ability to replicate rather than random drift. The normal accumulation of RNA y to much higher levels than RNA QL in all strains studied thus far, including CV17, is an indication that differences in replication efficiency do exist among these RNAs (Fig. 3) . Alternatively, natural selection pressures on RNA N may not apply to RNA y, hence allowing genetic drift of the two leader se-quences. As a result of this divergence, only one of the two small overlapping ORFs present in the CV17 y leader is present in the CV17 N leader. It has been shown that the small y leader ORFs play a significant role in the efficiency of in vitro translation of the CV17 ya gene and can affect systemic movement and pathogenicity of ND1 8KV17 pseudorecombinants in N. benthamiana (8). However, the N origin of these small leader ORFs is not significant, since the Type strain y leader also contains a small ORF with unrelated sequence that has a similar effect on translation and systemic movement (8). Thus, phenotypic effects, if any, resulting from recombination of the CV17 RNA 01 and y leader regions have not yet been observed.",
