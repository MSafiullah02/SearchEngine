Sequence alignment of SCV helicase with other coronavirus helicases were obtained using program ClustalW v.1.8 [11]. The ATP binding site motif was predicted with MotifScan software available at the Expasy web-site [12]. Secondary structure prediction and fold recognition studies were performed by using PsiPred v.2.1 [13] and Pyre v.0.2 [14], respectively. Using the fold recognition method the helicase of SARS Coronavirus (SwissProt Accession ID P59641) [15] identifies the 1UAA pdb entry [16]. Model building of the major domain (494 aminoacids) of SARS helicase was carried out using ClustalW v.1.8 [11] alignment between the target sequence and that of the template structure. Models were subsequently optimized according to secondary structure predictions. Substitution of aminoacid residues and modeling of insertions and deletions in the target structure were performed using DeepView v.3.7 software [17]. The 3D models were optimized by a 900 step minimization run with AMBER [18] and finally validated with the PROCHECK v.3.5.4 procedure [19] and PROSAII v.4.0 software [20].",

To investigate the structure of MBD and helicase domain, a docking simulation was performed using ESCHER software [23]. A first coarse run with a rotation step of 10\u00b0 was carried out and approximately 500 results were collected. Only those models that were consistent with the available experimental data were subjected to a second run with a rotation step of 2\u00b0 between \u00b1 20\u00b0 of the starting position in order to refine the most probable structures. The major side-chain clashes were removed by a 900 cycles minimization in the AMBER force Field [18].",

Thus, a representative consensus sequence was obtained for the SCV helicase, suggesting the presence of two separate domains, i.e., the helicase domain (Hel) and a metal binding domain (MBD). Such a combination of a putative MBD and a Hel domain in the same protein, as in Equine Arterivirus nsp10, has been found in a number of other viral and cellular proteins [24], [25], [26]. Accordingly, the nsp13 model building was performed in two separate steps, one for each domain of the enzyme, and a hybrid protein structure was assembled from the two modeled domains.",

In fact, arterivirus helicases have been shown to possess MBD domains which coordinate four Zn2+\n[28], [29] in a way that could be similarly adopted by coronaviruses. In this Zn2+ binding domain, known also as binuclear cluster, a Cys residue coordinates two closely spaced Zn2+ ions bridging a Zn2Cys6 group, typically found in GAL4-like proteins [30] with Zn2Cys4His2, found in RAG1 domain [31]. The SCV MBD structure has been reconstructed using tetrahedral geometry characterization, distance constraints, and orientations typical of Cys and His residues of the latter clusters, suggested by the crystal structures of GAL4-like and RAG1. The corresponding Protein Data Bank files, 1PYI, and 1RMD, respectively [30], [31], provided accurate distance constraints for the two components of the MBD.",

The theoretical structure of SCV nsp13, shown in Fig. 1\n, was again confirmed by PROCHECK v.3.5.4 [19] and deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the ID code 2G1F.",

In Fig. 2\n, we compared the energy profiles obtained with PROSAII program package [20] for the isolated Hel and MBD domains with the one calculated for the entire SCV helicase structure. From the negative values of the energy, which have been obtained by subtracting the energy profile of the two separate domains from the one calculated for the final protein structure, see Fig. 2, it is apparent that higher stability is achieved when the two domains are assembled. Negative peaks in the latter profiles, indeed, are found for the interface regions of the two domains, i.e., 42\u201348 residues for MBD and 198\u2013204, 325\u2013335, and 353\u2013360 residues for the Hel domain, respectively.",
