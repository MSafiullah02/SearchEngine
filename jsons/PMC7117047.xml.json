The moist coating of saliva and mucus will evaporate, leaving a residual dry nucleus of the droplet that may include one or more bacteria or viruses. The dried droplets are called droplet nuclei and are responsible for human-to-human transmission of the airborne infectious pathogens. Although the exact mechanism underlying droplet nuclei infection is not fully understood, it is known that the first step in a series of dose\u2013response relations leading to the infection is the regional deposition of inhaled particles in the lung. Generally speaking, the intake dose (or called the exposure dose) is a function of both temporal and spatial droplet nuclei concentration which depends on the physical characteristics of the nuclei such as droplet sizes and airflow patterns, as well as many environmental factors including relative source-to-receiver locations.",

            "text": "Expiratory droplets can be classified as coarse and fine aerosols. Coarse aerosols do not become truly airborne as they settle onto the floor rapidly after emission, whereas fine aerosols remain airborne for a prolonged period because of their low settling velocity and lead to a high potential for long-range infections [17]. Preliminary studies show that droplet size is one key factor affecting the spread of droplet nuclei. An updated review has summarized three past studies (spanned over the last five decades) on the sizes of particles emitted during coughing or sneezing [6]. It has been reported that for droplets less than 50 \u03bcm, the dispersion feature is dominant due to the very short evaporation time [18], [19]. Hence, in this work, evaporating was not considered and two droplet nuclei sizes, 0.01 and 10 \u03bcm, corresponding to fine and coarse nuclei for viral and bacteria infections, respectively, were chosen. Another key factor is the droplet emission velocity. Reportedly, the initial emission velocity can be up to 100 m/s [20]. A recent study on coughed airflows of healthy males showed that the emission velocity was in the range of 6\u201322 m/s [21]. Based on these results, three velocities namely 20, 50 and 100 m/s were selected for this work. Breathing will also disturb the airflow pattern. However, due to the relatively small airflow volume when breathing, the exhaling process is believed to have little influence on the room airflow pattern [22]. Thus it was not considered in the present work.",

The relative orientation and distance between the source and the (susceptible) receiver plays an ultimate role in exposure levels [6]. Based on daily observation and engineering judgment, two source-to-receiver orientations were considered in this work: (1) the source facing the receiver directly (i.e. a face-to-face orientation); (2) the source facing a wall directly (i.e. a face-to-wall orientation). In reality, it is very unlikely that the source can turn more than 90o before an expiratory process commences. Therefore, it is anticipated that results from the face-to-face orientation represent maximal exposure level while those from the face-to-wall orientation give a (practical) minimal exposure.",

Intuitively, it contradicts with the previous discussion that particles with such a small relaxation time should follow the global airflow pattern closely regardless of the emission velocity. The difference is attributed to the finite emission duration together with low velocity background airflow. For the displacement case, the emission velocity is \u201csignificantly\u201d higher comparing to the global airflow.

Fig. 5, Fig. 6\ndepict the concentration profiles for the two chosen droplet nuclei sizes in the breathing plan as well as at mid-plane. Under the well-mixed scheme, well-mixed conditions can be achieved within 90 s after droplet emission as the airflow and the droplet cloud travel in the same direction (more quantitative analysis below). Under the displacement scheme, due to the lower global velocity, only moderate inhomogeneous concentration can be noticed even at 240 s after the emission. Low concentration regions (hereafter referred to droplet-free can be observed under the displacement scheme. One is identified at the air supply area (bottom right of Fig. 6(a)). Formed as a consequence of the removal characteristics of displacement ventilation, i.e. the warm, stale air ascends to the ceiling where it is exhausted through the outlet, the droplet-free area is observed. The (contaminated) vertical thermal plume makes the droplets less likely to disperse within the room. Compared with well-mixed ventilation, displacement ventilation has a much lower average eddy diffusivity (about 1/20 of the well-mixed's). The droplets, largely influenced by buoyant airflow, are less dispersed by the turbulence. Another droplet-free region exists on the rear side of the source and occupies almost half of the breathing plane (Fig. 6(b)). This can be attributed to the prevailing flow direction and very low transport velocity in that region (Fig. 2(b)).",

All of these programs assume uniform distribution of particles within each microenvironment and particles are transported by convective airflow only. All but one program ignore Brownian and turbulent diffusion for the transport mechanisms [34]. Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8 clearly illustrate that the well-mixed assumption is over-simplified, particularly for the face-to-wall orientation. For certain airborne transmitted diseases, even inhalation of a small dose can cause infection [20], [35]. To improve exposure assessment, more accurate predictions on the spatial concentration distribution (or exposure) and the mixing degree are highly desirable. More importantly, engineers can thereby design and implement better control strategies for reducing airborne pollutant concentration.",

In the former scheme, the three emission velocities collapse into a single line and that is consistent with the previous discussion on relaxation time. In the latter scheme, the CV depends on the emission velocity: the higher the emission velocity, the lower the CV (i.e. better mixing). Due to its higher global airflow velocity, as expected, well-mixed ventilation always has a lower (resulting) CV than displacement ventilation. Recent study has also shown that the higher velocity of well-mixed ventilation scheme resulted in faster mixing rate than with the displacement ventilation [37]. Another factor affecting the concentration is droplet deposition. The high airflow rate might also increase the particle deposition onto indoor surfaces [38], [39] but for the particle sizes concerned in the present work, ventilation is still the dominant particle removal mechanisms.",

On the contrary, very high concentration gradients will be observed under displacement ventilation. This essential difference between the concentration profiles forms the basis for the implementation of engineering strategies for reducing exposure to airborne particles. Recently, many active devices for the removal of indoor pollutants have been designed and made available commercially. Technologies applied include high efficiency filtration, adsorption onto surfaces, inactivation by UV, and photocatalytic oxidation by titanium oxide. To effectively reduce the pollutants, the device should be installed at the location where high concentration exists. From the present findings, two major inferences can be drawn. First, the location of the active device is not a concern under any well-mixed ventilation schemes. Second, in order to achieve maximum pollutant removal efficacy under any displacement ventilation schemes, the active device should be installed near the exhaust outlet or high ceiling (c.f. Figs.6(a) and (c) and 8(a) and (c)). This can prevent further airborne infection by inactivating the droplets before they (if any) disperse back into the environment.",

Incorporation of moving boundary to the present geometry involves very complex modeling techniques, and procedures. We understand that this assumption will impose some constraints to the calculated results. For the well-mixed ventilation scenario, however, due to the relatively large airflow movement, we anticipate that the spatial and temporal concentration level calculated will not be affected significantly. The exposure level of the moving object can be estimated approximately by \u2211x\u222bCx(t)dt where x represents the occupant location inside the domain. For the displacement ventilation, the buoyancy airflow inside the domain is induced primarily by the presence of the occupants.
