Serogroup A is more prevalent in developing countries whereas, in the developed countries the disease is mostly caused by serogroup B and C [3]. In India, meningococcal disease is endemic in Delhi with sporadic cases reported in the past [1]. Isolated cases of meningococcal meningitis were also reported from several states of India involving Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Gujarat, Jammu & Kashmir, West Bengal, Chandigarh, Kerala and Orissa in 1985 [4]. Most of these outbreaks have been caused by serogroup A [5]. N. meningitidis was the dominant pathogen isolated in Surat between 1985 and 87 [6]. In early 2005, spurt of cases of Neiserria meningococcemia and meningitis due to serogroup A have been reported from Delhi and adjoining areas [7]. No previous reports exist from north east India.",

Shock is endotoxin mediated and due to factors such as widespread capillary leak, loss of vasomotor tone and maldistribution of intravascular volume, impaired myocardial function and impaired cellular function. Early recognition of shock is crucial for early intervention and improved outcome [13]. Tachycardia may be the only sign present in the early phase of the disease and is enough to mandate fluid resuscitation. Circulatory management aims to maintain tissue perfusion and oxygenation. Repeated fluid boluses with 20 ml/kg of isotonic saline are to be given initially till shock resolves. In case shock persists after 60 ml/kg of fluid, central venous pressure (CVP) line is inserted and fluid resuscitation continued with addition of dopamine and/or dobutamine. Some children require as high as 100\u2013200 ml/kg of fluid resuscitation but such patients also require mechanical ventilation. About 13.6 % of the index cases required inotropic support either alone or in combination for an average duration of 24\u201372 h. Some studies have shown that 4.5 % albumin is more useful as a resuscitating fluid [14]. Albumin is routinely used in the UK with significant reduction in mortality in the last 20 y (decrease up to 2 %) in patients with meningococcal disease and albumin use may play a role along with other factors [15]. The authors do not have any personal experience of using albumin. Survival rate reaches 94 % when shock is reversed within 75 min of presentation [13].",

However in the authors\u2019 experience they had patients with good response to ceftriaxone in the beginning of the epidemic. After about 6 mo of the epidemic, there was poor clinical response to ceftriaxone and the unit antibiotic policy was revised to intravenous chloramphenicol for 7 d with good response.

The authors used injection dexamethasone in all meningococcal meningitis cases for 2 d. Steroids are not indicated in meningococcal shock unless there is suspicion of hypoadrenalism. Overall fatality rate of invasive meningococcal infection is 5\u201316 %, although these rates are difficult to assess as some studies only take into account meningococcal meningitis, while others reflect overall fatality from meningococcal disease [27, 28]. Reported mortality from meningococcemia ranges from 18 % to 35 % [29]. For overall invasive meningococcal infection, the fatality rate in the present study was low (6.4 %). For meningococcemia, fatality rate in the present study was 18.2 % which is similar to other studies [29]. Low mortality in the present study can be explained by the fact that patients reached the hospital fast due to good information, education and communication activities by the local health authorities, combined with a low threshold for diagnosis and aggressive management of shock, rapidity of administration of the first antibiotic dose (door to needle time) and continuous monitoring in a well equipped pediatric intensive care unit.",
