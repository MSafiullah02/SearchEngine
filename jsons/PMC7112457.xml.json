The syndrome, called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has spread to many countries on several continents and has taken its toll in illness and death. Through the efforts of an international consortium of laboratories, the causative agent of SARS was identified as a new type of coronavirus. In less than 2 months after the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified, the genomic sequences of two independently isolated viruses were completed.1 Here, we report our initial efforts to develop a SARS-CoV vaccine. We generated three adenoviral-based vectors that express codon-optimised SARS-CoV strain Urbani structural antigens, including the spike protein S1 fragment, membrane protein, and nucleocapsid protein. We constructed adenoviral vectors in which early regions 1 and 3 had been deleted by use of Cre-lox recombination. Codon optimisation and gene synthesis were done with the UpGene codon optimisation algorithm software (http://www.vectorcore.pitt.eduupgene.html). Combinations of spike, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins have been tested previously as vaccines against different strains of coronavirus. In particular, induction of high concentrations of virus-specific antibodies against transmissible gastroenteritis requires stimulation by at least two viral proteins, and the best responses are induced by a combination of spike and nucleocapsid proteins.2\n",

We transfected HEK293 cells with expression plasmids encoding the SI fragment or a control empty plasmid, and cells were harvested 48 h later. Lysates were separated by gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidine difluoride (PVDF) membrane. Antibodies against the SI fragment were detected by immunoprobing with immunised animal serum (1 in 1000), followed by detection with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antimonkey IgG (H+L). Western blot analysis detected antibodies against the SI fragment in all six immunised animals but not in either control animal at 6 weeks after vaccination (figure 1\n). To investigate T-cell responses in immunised monkeys, we did ELISPOT assays to measure production of interferon \u03b3 on peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained at intervals after vaccination as described.3 We used 15-mer overlapping peptides as antigens, which represented the complete sequence of the SARS-CoV strain Urbani nucleocapsid protein. We chose the nucleocapsid protein because it is a representative antigen for the T-cell response in this vaccine setting. All animals receiving intramuscular injections of Ad5-SARS-CoV vaccine showed nucleocapsid-specific T-cell responses in response to immunisation (figure 2\n). The intensity of the response varied among animals, but was generally largest after the booster vaccination, with a peak frequency of about one nucleocapsid-specific T cell per 2000 freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (monkeys 13601 and 1201; figure 2).",

We diluted heat-inactivated serum samples serially and seeded them in triplicate into 96-well plates. We then added about 37 plaque forming units of SARS-CoV (Urbani strain). After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, we added 200 000 E6 Vero cells and incubated the plates for a further 3\u20134 days. Cells were then stained with crystal violet-formaldehyde for 1 h. The neutralisation titre was measured as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that completely inhibited E6 Vero cell lysis in at least two of the three triplicate wells. Serum samples from vaccinated animals but not from control animals showed strong neutralising capacity against SARS-CoV after immunisation, some of which appeared even at early time points (figure 2). Notably, three animals in the test group (1699, 1201, and 11300) had low concentrations of pre-existing neutralising antibody to Ad5 because of previous exposure to the Ad5 vector (data not shown), yet they responded in a similar manner as non-immune animals do to vaccination. These findings support use of such an adenoviral-based vaccine platform in people even if they have pre-existing adenoviral immunity.",

It is essential to determine whether patients convalescing from SARS have similar responses, since this could suggest that such vaccine-induced responses are protective. The capacity for our immunisation strategy to protect from infection will require challenge tests in a clinically relevant SARS disease animal model. Use of such a model will also be important to exclude any potential for vaccine-induced immunopathology, as seen in the feline infectious peritonitis virus model.4 A non-human primate challenge model of SARS has been described,5 although its suitability for vaccine testing remains to be determined.",
