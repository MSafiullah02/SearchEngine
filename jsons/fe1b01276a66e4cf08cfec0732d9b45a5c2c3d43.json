Serum immunoglobulins and electrophoresis were normal. Blood cultures were negative. Admission chest x-ray and seasonal respiratory viral PCR panel (including, but not limited to, influenza A and B, rhinovirus and adenovirus) was negative. SARS-CoV-2 nose and throat swab taken on the day of admission and run using VIASURE by BioTec SARS-CoV-2 with QiaSymphony virus DSP extraction, returned positive on day two of admission with a cycle threshold value of 28.7. Graphs 1-4 show the pattern of change of ferritin, neutrophils, platelets and dOn day two of admission there was ongoing pancytopaenia and an increasing ferritin level. Bone marrow aspirate showed reactive marrow with no evidence of malignant infiltration. A bone marrow trephine could not be tolerated. The patient's H-Score 2 was calculated at 220, suggesting a probability of HLH of 93-96%. Considering Russell and colleagues' 3 comments about the potential harm of corticosteroid use in patients with Covid-19 infection, the patient was commenced on treatment with the selective IL-1 receptor antagonist drug, Anakinra (100mg/day), alongside a two day course of intravenous immunoglobulin.
