            "text": "The developmental sequence of a neurotropic strain (JHM) of mouse hepatitis virus was examined by transmission electron microscopy and immunocytology. The nucleoprotein core of this coronavirus, which contains RNA of positive polarity and is helical in configuration, becomes incorporated into enveloped particles in the same manner as the nucleocapsids of the orthomyxo-and paramyxoviruses. However, JHM virus is assembled intracellularly by budding at surfaces of smooth membranous vacuoles. A comparison of JHM virus replication in L2 and 17C1-1 cell lines revealed that L2 cells undergo more rapid cytopathology and cease virus production much sooner than 17CI-I cells. In L2 cells the accumulation of core material appears to continue after the abrupt cessation of virus assembly. This is evident by the massive cytoplasmic accumulation of structures resembling nucleocapsids, which react with hybridoma antibody to the nucleocapsid antigen as demonstrated by the immunoperoxidase procedure. The current findings are consistent with our previously published demonstration, using cells of neural and other deviation, of the fundamental role of the host cell type in regulat ing the replication and expression of coronaviruses.",

The budding pro cess has been described in some detail in the case of avian infectious bronchitis virus, the human agent (229E [4] ), and other isolates [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] , Although most data favor budding as the assembly mechanism, some reservations have been made about the significance of this process [15, 16] . During replication of the neurotropic strain JHM of mouse hepatitis virus in oligodendrocytes, within the central nervous system of rats manifesting chronic demyelinating disease, there are evident few virions and large cytoplasmic inclusions con sisting of elements resembling virus cores [17] . By contrast, during highly productive cycles of JHM virus replication in the I7CI-I cell line, such inclusions are absent [18] . The pre sent investigation was undertaken to ascertain whether deficient assembly of virions and accumulation of nucleocapsids are inter related phenomena. . The derivation and methods for pro pagating, in suspension or as monolayers, murine L2 cells have been described previously [19] , These lines are routinely maintained in Eagle's MEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Micro biological Associates),sodium bicarbonate(2 g/l),peni cillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 mg/l) in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO >.

In contrast to the cytopathology associated with JHM virus infection of 170-1 cells, the progressive development of syncytia in monolayers of L2 cells, inoculated at about the same low multi plicity (0.004-0.1 PFU/cell), was much more rapid and extensive [19] , involving practically the whole monolayer within 24-36 h. For this reason, cultures of this host cell type were sampled for electron microscopy within 24 h postinfection. To preserve as faithfully as possible the structural relationship between sites of virus development and related cellular organelles, as they occurred in the living state, fixation and embedding of attached cells were carried out in situ.

Absence of ribosomes on the cytoplasmic face of the vacuole membranes implies that these structures are derived from smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). Their random distribution, as ascertained by both vertical and horizontal sections, implies that they occur throughout the cytoplasm. Occur rence of circular, rather than flattened, pro files of the sectioned vacuoles indicates that the SER becomes distended following infec tion. Virus assembly is confined to these vacuoles ( fig. 2-10) and has not been observed at the plasma membrane or any other cellular surface. This is in agreement with other studies of the coronaviruses [2, 24] , but at variance with sites of assembly of enveloped viruses from the orthomyxo-, paramyxo-. and rhabdovirus groups [25] [26] [27] , An interpretation of the dynamic events during JHM virus assembly in polykaryocytes was based upon a series of images, ordered into a developmental sequence ( fig. 3-10) . The most rudimentary stage was identified by the presence of a short segment of dense material subjacent to the vacuolar membrane ( fig. 3,4 ). An associated unit membrane was clearly evident on the external surface and is presumed to represent the viral envelope covered by the peplomers (fig. 6. 9 ). Elongated structures, which in some images appeared to be tubular in nature, were organized on the cytoplasmic side of the modified vacuolar surface ( fig. 3-6 ). In the more advanced stages of budding, the virus envelope surrounded the elongated, in ternal component to a varying degree ( fig. 3 , 7-10).

These dimensions correspond to measurements made on the extruded coronavirus helical component, evident by negative staining [29.30] , and on a dense internal thread present within thinly sectioned, infectious avian bronchitis virus [28] . An internal com ponent of greater diameter has been recorded in one study [31] . Our measurements also cor respond to the diameter of the influenza virus nucleoprotein, which has a diameter of either 6-9 nm in sectioned virions [28] or 10-15 nm in whole mount preparations [25, 26] . By con trast. the diameter of the helical nucleocapsid of the paramyxoviruses, measuring 15-19 nm [24, 32, 33] , is about double the width of the coronavirus cores. According to another recent interpretation, the coronavirus nucleocapsid structure is described as a circular, dense, inner component, about 60 nm in diameter [7] , Our new evidence, coupled with information ob tained on disrupted negatively stained 229E virions [29, 31] and on another representative of the group [30] , indicate that the architecture of the coronaviruses simulates that of the orthomyxo-and paramyxoviruses, although the coronaviruses, unlike the other two groups, possess a single-stranded RNA genome of the + sense. From this observation it may be con cluded that polarity of the RNA genome and helical conformation of the nucleoprotein are not necessarily interrelated.",
