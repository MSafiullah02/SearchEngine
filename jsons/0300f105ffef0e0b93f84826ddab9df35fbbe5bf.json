            "text": "Despite extraordinary advances in diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccine development, emerging and reemerging viral diseases have occurred during the past several decades [1, 2] . Several factors that contributed to the emergence of recent epidemics have been identified including those related to the microbial agent, the human host, and the human environment. Also among the most important factors are genetic adaptations of the microbial agent, international travel, human susceptibility to infection, population growth, an aging population, climate and weather changes, and expanding vector habitats [2] [3] [4] [5] . Three recent examples of disease emergence are the Middle East Respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Chikungunya, and the Zika viruses, which represent new viral entities or viruses emergent in new geographic locales and characterized by novel complications [6, 7] . However, the most important newest example of an emergent infectious disease is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, which emerged a century ago in a primate host(s), and subsequently spread within the human population. HIV-related acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), the most dreadful complication, was first recognized in 1981 in men who have sex with men, injection drug users, and recipients of blood transfusions [8] [9] [10] . Subsequently, in the year 1983, Francois Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi, Luc Montagnier, and others from the Institute Pasteur in Paris identified the etiologic agent of this disease and called it the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Both French virologists were awarded the Nobel Prize in 2008 for this discovery. At present, however, HIV infection has become a global disease affecting heterosexual individuals, especially within the developing world [11] .",

Rates of prevalence for PsA in HIV patients pre-cART was higher than in the general population, 0.4-5.7% vs. 0.25%, respectively [40, 52] and rates of incidence similar in both populations, 0.07%/annum vs. 0.05% [30, 46] . The populations studied, however, were in different stages of HIV infection. It should also be noted that patients with HIV and psoriasis had more severe and persistent lesions, and when compared with patients with classic psoriasis in HIV several morphological types can coexist in the same patient and that PsA was severe, deforming, erosive, and refractory to conventional therapy [53, 54] .",

On the other hand, the presence of low titer RF and CCP antibodies in patients with HIV may lead to an erroneous diagnosis of RA. HIV patients may also exhibit a high proportion of RF and CCP antibodies, which decrease after initiation of cART suggesting that HIV is capable of inducing autoantibodies. Follow-up studies, however, of this HIV population does not reveal the development of RA [61] [62] [63] [64] . In addition, it is well recognized the presence of false-positive HIV serology in patients with RA suggesting a cross-reactivity between HIV diagnostic tests in patients with RA [65] . Another important issue was the impact of de novo HIV infection in established RA [66, 67] . An early observation in the pandemic was that most RA patients might go into remission after the development of AIDS. However, the presence of active RA disease including radiological progression can be seen despite a profound state of immunosuppression [68, 69] . Also, development of de novo RF and CCP antibodies positive RA can be seen in well control HIV infection (normal CD4 cell count and negative HIV viral load), and RA disease activity behaves in identical fashion as in RA seen in HIV negative individuals.",

The use of these agents may represent a challenge, especially in patients with co-existent hepatitis infection, but published reports indicate that in the presence of stable CD4+ T cell counts and low viral loads their use can be both safe and efficacious. When considering immune suppressive therapy, it is important to keep in mind that CD4+ T cells are necessary in the control of intracellular and extracellular bacteria, parasites, and viruses, and the presence of TNF is needed and useful for controlling infection, and its increase favors replication of viral particles.",
