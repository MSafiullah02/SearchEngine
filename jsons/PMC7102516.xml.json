Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), previously referred to as 2019-nCoV, is the virus responsible for causing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) [[3], [4], [5], [6], [7]]. The pandemic traces its early beginnings to the report of a cluster of 27 unexplained pneumonia cases in late December 2019 originating from a seafood and live animal market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China [[8], [9], [10], [11]]. From the outset, the causative agent was thought to be viral, with most patients reporting fever or dyspnea [9,11]. With unprecedented numbers of individuals under travel restrictions or quarantine, worldwide spread, and no known cure or vaccine yet available, COVID-19 has proven a formidable adversary [12,[13], [14], [15]].",

Transmission of the virus through contaminated surfaces or fomites with subsequent contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth may also occur [14,23,27]. Patients are felt to be at highest risk of spreading the illness when they are most symptomatic [23,27]. Limited data support viral shedding in asymptomatic patients while increased levels of viral shedding may be more pronounced in those critically ill [[28], [29], [30]]. Current epidemiologic patterns of COVID-19 in China indicate that it is highly contagious with sustained spread; the extent of person-to-person transmission within the U.S. was initially limited but has progressed now to community transmission in many parts of the country [23]. The current R0 or basic reproduction number is estimated to be >2.2; for every case of COVID-19 identified in the population, >2 additional cases are possible in the absence of adequate isolation.

While 80.9% of these cases were reported to be mild, the overall case fatality rate was 2.3% [34]. Few pediatric cases of COVID-19 have been reported, with patients aged 0\u201319 years representing just 2.1% of all cases [34,35]. Approximately 3.8% of laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 occurred in healthcare personnel, and 14.6% of these cases were either severe or critical [34]. To be classified as severe, the following characteristics were required: PaO2/FiO2 < 300, oxygen saturation \u2264 93%, presence of >50% lung infiltrates within 24\u201348 h, respirations \u226530 breaths/min, or dyspnea [34]. Critical patients, defined as those with septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction/failure, and/or respiratory failure, accounted for approximately 5% of the study population with a case fatality rate of 49.0% [34,24]. The highest case fatality rate was observed in those older than 80 years (14.8%) [34]. Patients without comorbidities had a case fatality rate of just 0.9%, in contrast to those with comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease (10.5%) [34].",

            "text": "The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to other viral upper respiratory illnesses and include fever, cough, fatigue, and dyspnea [6,8,43]. The differential diagnosis for COVID-19 should be tailored to the patient and their presenting symptoms and comorbidities. Influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), other viral illnesses, and bacterial pneumonia should be considered, as well as other pulmonary diseases (ie, pulmonary embolism). Completing a thorough yet focused history and physical examination and obtaining collateral history from family members are vital. Aside from pulmonary symptoms, patients with COVID-19 may initially present with more vague complaints including diarrhea, lethargy, myalgias, and nausea [40,57]. Patients may also experience headache, confusion, vomiting, pleurisy, sore throat, sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion [40,58]. A case series of 41 patients (median age 49.0 years) with COVID-19 from Wuhan, China found the most commonly reported symptoms were cough (76%), fever (98%), or dyspnea (55%) [39]. In the same case series, patients also reported myalgias/fatigue (44%), productive cough (28%), headache (8%), hemoptysis (5%), and diarrhea (3%) [39]. In a nationwide study of COVID-19 cases from across China, the most common presenting symptoms included cough (68%), fever (44%), fatigue (38%), sputum production (34%), and shortness of breath (19%) [59]. Fever was not a predominant symptom at the time of initial presentation. In patients with more severe disease, dyspnea may be present in 37% of patients and progress to acute lung injury in 15% of patients [60]. One study of 204 patients with confirmed COVID-19 suggests 48.5% of patients have gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms [61]. These symptoms may include anorexia (83.8%), diarrhea (29.3%), vomiting (0.8%), and abdominal pain (0.4%). Seven of the 204 patients had only GI symptoms with no respiratory symptoms [61].",

Emergency medical dispatchers should consider whether callers describing risk factors and symptoms concerning for COVID-19 should be identified as a potential PUI [30,68]. If so, EMS personnel arriving on-scene as well as HCPs at the receiving hospital should be notified immediately to ensure proper personal protective equipment (PPE) use and confirm that appropriate isolation facilities are available [30,68]. Once contact is made with the patient, initial triage and assessment should be done at least 6 ft or 2 meters away and minimized until the PUI dons a facemask [68]. In addition to limiting the number of EMS personnel in the patient compartment, those providing any direct patient care should follow standard, droplet (surgical mask), and contact precautions (gown and gloves) while wearing eye protection (face shield or goggles) [68]. Airborne precautions (N95 respirator) should be employed if the patient is critically ill and/or if an aerosol-generating procedure is anticipated during transport. Ideally, transport vehicles with isolated compartments or high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration should be used, and the patient should be transferred directly to a treatment room on arrival at the receiving healthcare facility [68]. After the patient has been transported and EMS documentation is being completed, patient compartment doors should be left open to allow proper ventilation [68]. When cleaning the vehicle, disposable gown, gloves, surgical mask, and face shield should be worn [68]. Routine cleaning should be followed by application of a hospital-grade disinfectant, preferably one approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for use against emerging viral pathogens including SARS-CoV-2 [68].",

When caring for a stable PUI, HCPs should adhere to droplet (surgical mask), contact (gown and gloves), and standard precautions with the addition of eye protection (face shield or goggles) [8,57,62,64,69]. If a PUI is critically ill or an aerosol-generating procedure (e.g., endotracheal intubation, suctioning of the airway, sputum induction) is necessary, HCPs should escalate to airborne precautions with the use of a fitted N95 respirator in place of a surgical mask [62,69,70]. Reusable respirators such as powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs) may also be used, but should be disinfected and maintained appropriately [69]. Patients with a history of COVID-19 exposure presenting with non-infectious symptoms may be evaluated and treated in adherence to standard precautions alone [64].",

Rescue intubations should be avoided whenever possible as complete adherence to PPE may be inadequate in a time-sensitive critical scenario [72]. Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) Surviving Sepsis COVID-19 guidelines recommend performing endotracheal intubation under airborne precautions, including use of a fitted N95 respirator and placement of the patient in an AIIR [70]. Based on prior cases of HCPs infected with SARS-CoV-1 while using N95 respirators, some experts recommend using a PAPR [72]. The most experienced provider should intubate [70,72]. To reduce inadvertent contamination by touching one's face or hair, a full face shield and head cover is recommended if a PAPR is not used [30,72]. Wrist exposure can be minimized by using longer-sleeved gloves or vertically taping gloves to the gown [30]. Applying tape circumferentially makes removing PPE more difficult and does not have added benefit [30]. Shoe covers should be avoided, as they can lead to accidental self-contamination. Instead, impermeable shoes that can be appropriately decontaminated should be worn [30]. If available, coveralls with or without a hood may be used, but processes and training in safe doffing should be established beforehand as HCPs may be less experienced in using these PPE ensembles [30].",

Preoxygenation should be optimized with non-aerosol generating strategies including head of bed elevation, jaw thrust, and use of positive end expiratory pressure valves. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy should be avoided unless absolutely necessary as atomization of anesthetic will cause the virus to become aerosolized [72]. Preoxygenation for at least 5 min with 100% oxygen before performing rapid sequence intubation (RSI) may be used with nasal cannula, though this may increase the risk of contamination [30,72]. To reduce this risk, a surgical mask can be placed on the patient over the device. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) may increase risk of aerosolization and is not recommended for preoxygenation [30,72]. A high efficiency hydrophobic filter should be used between the facemask and the rest of the respiratory circuit [72]. Video laryngoscopy is preferred to direct laryngoscopy to increase distance between the intubator and the patient [30,70]. A closed system should be utilized for suctioning. Once the intubation is complete, the emergency physician should immediately place the laryngoscope in their outer glove along with all other equipment used for intubation in a double zip-locked plastic bag [72]. The presence of a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter should be verified in the expiratory limb of the mechanical ventilator prior to patient use.",

A patient with negative RT-PCR with continued suspicion of COVID-19 should be isolated and rechecked several days later. Molecular testing (e.g., respiratory virus panel) for alternative diagnoses such as influenza should be considered for all PUIs [67]. However, co-infection with other viruses may occur.",

Several vaccines are under study, including DNA-based, vector-based, and protein based vaccines [80]. Supportive care is the mainstay of treatment, preferably with acetaminophen [4,15]. If pneumonia is present on imaging or the patient is critically ill, antibiotics are recommended. Patients presenting with respiratory insufficiency in the setting of potential COVID-19 infection should be given supplementary oxygen to maintain an oxygenation saturation \u226590% but no higher than 96% [62,70]. Up to 76% of patients require oxygen therapy [40]. For those with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure who require intubation, endotracheal intubation should be performed. For those with hypoxemic respiratory failure who do not require intubation but who do not improve with conventional oxygen therapies, high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is recommended over noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) [70]. If HFNC is not available and there is no urgent need for intubation, a trial of NIPPV ventilation is recommended with frequent reassessment, though NIPPV increases the risk of aerosolization [70]. NIPPV may result in patient improvement. The SCCM does not make a clear recommendation for helmet NIPPV compared to mask NIPPV [70]. While most recommend avoiding NIPPV due to the risk of aerosolization, it can be utilized safely if high risk patients are cohorted and clinicians use appropriate PPE [81]. Patients who decline despite use of HFNC or NIPPV should be intubated [70]. If intubation is indicated, airborne precautions should be used with the patient ventilated using tidal volumes of 4\u20138 mL/kg of predicted body weight and plateau pressures <30 cm H2O [62]. If available, patients with severe ARDS may benefit from prone ventilation >12 h per day [62,70].",

Even when COVID-19 is suspected as the cause of the patient's symptoms, the WHO recommends administering empiric antibiotics and a neuraminidase inhibitor within 1 h of identifying sepsis [62]. Early recognition of septic shock is critical, with management of sepsis focusing on intravenous fluid resuscitation and antibiotics [62]. A conservative resuscitation strategy with buffered/balanced crystalloids is recommended for those in shock, and hypotonic crystalloids should be avoided [62,70]. Vasopressors, preferentially norepinephrine, are indicated for persistent shock with a goal MAP of 60\u201365 mmHg [62,70]. For those with continued shock despite norepinephrine, vasopressin should be added, rather than increasing norepinephrine dose [70]. If cardiac dysfunction is present and there is persistent hypoperfusion, dobutamine is recommended [70]. Systemic steroids (hydrocortisone 200 mg per day) should be considered in those with vasopressor-refractory shock or for those with another indication for steroids such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation [22,62,70]. Without delaying antibiotic administration, bacterial blood cultures should be obtained [62].",

An in vitro study found that remdesivir and chloroquine inhibit viral infection, but further study is required [84,85]. Results from a single study of over 100 COVID-19 patients found chloroquine was superior to control in reducing pneumonia exacerbation, improving imaging findings and virus-negative conversion, and shortening the course of the disease [86]. A study evaluating lopinavir-ritonavir found no improvement in patient survival or differences in detectable viral RNA [87]. Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are also under study [88]. In a single prospective, observational study of 36 patients with COVID-19, those receiving hydroxychloroquine demonstrated higher rates of viral load reduction/disappearance, though no patient centered outcomes were assessed [88]. Other medications under study include tocilizumab and favipiravir [89,90]. There are no clear data supporting harm or benefit with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or ACE receptor blockers (ARBs) [91,92]. Unless authorized through a clinically approved trial or Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered Interventions Framework (MEURI), unlicensed treatments should not be administered [62]. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and immunoglobulin have been utilized for management, but have not been definitively shown to be beneficial [40].",

Patients with mild symptoms and no significant comorbidities without concern for deterioration of clinical condition may be candidates for discharge, self-quarantine for two weeks, and home monitoring [93]. These patients must have the ability to be safely isolated at home to prevent transmission to others and be carefully monitored [22]. Social distancing is a vital component of reducing the spread of the virus, comprised of limiting events, mass gatherings, and even small group meeting [94]. Individuals should remain 6 ft or 2 meters apart from other individuals. Health departments should be involved early in the care of these patients and can assist with decisions regarding disposition, further surveillance, and testing, especially until confirmatory test results are available [57,62]. Emergency physicians should counsel these patients to return for worrisome symptoms including new or worsening pulmonary complaints and fever [57,62]. Development of a clinical pathway among emergency physicians, infectious disease specialists, and health departments is critical to safely evaluate COVID-19 PUIs in the community.",

Patients typically present with a combination of fever or cough and have a history of exposure to either a close contact with COVID-19 or travel to an affected geographic area. While most patients will have mild disease, some may develop severe complications including ARDS and multi-organ failure, with some succumbing to the disease. Special consideration should be given to those at the extremes of age, the immunocompromised, or pregnant women. No curative treatment is currently approved. Emergency physicians should obtain a detailed travel history from all patients and suspect COVID-19 in patients presenting with symptoms of an acute upper respiratory illness and fever. Early recognition and isolation of a patient with COVID-19 in the ED may help decrease exposure to other patients and healthcare personnel. Future research is necessary to expand our collective knowledge of COVID-19 and optimize patient outcomes.",
