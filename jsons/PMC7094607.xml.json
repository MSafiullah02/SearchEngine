Aerosols are two-phase systems, consisting of the particles and the gas in which they are suspended. These aerosol particles suspended in the air that we breathe cause health problems (Hinds, 1999). A bioaerosol is an aerosol of biological origin. Bioaerosols include viruses, bacteria, fungi, and products of organisms (fungal spores and pollen) (Lee, 2011). The sources of bioaerosols are plants, animals (including humans), soil, and water. Bioaerosols are found in many types of indoors and outdoors. They vary greatly in the way they affect, not only our health and quality of life, but also visibility and the climate (Douwes et al., 2003; Hinds, 1999).",

Bioaerosols are suspected to be etiological agents for respiratory diseases such as allergic rhinitis, asthma (Bush and Portnoy, 2001, Cockcroft et al., 1977, Fiegel et al., 2006, Fung and Hughson, 2010, Zuskin et al., 1994), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Lacey and Crook, 1988, Matheson et al., 2005, Olenchock et al., 1990), and for infectious diseases such as influenza and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (World Health Organization: WHO, 2009). In particular, bacterial bioaerosols are known to relate to pneumonia, tuberculosis, brucellosis, anthrax, and Q fever (Arancibia et al., 2002, LaForce, 1986). Allergic effects of bioaerosols come from chemical components of bioaerosols and infection effects of bioaerosols come from viability of bioaerosols (Robbins et al., 2000, Shelton et al., 2002). Bioaerosols also received special attention in 2001 during events of bioterrorism (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2001). Therefore, because of the importance of bioaerosol researches, in several previous studies, the concentration of bioaerosols has been measured in indoor environments. In those studies, bioaerosols have been measured in restrooms (Lee et al., 2012), hospitals (Li and Hou, 2003, Pastuszka et al., 2005), houses (Jeon et al., 2010, Jo and Seo, 2005, Lee and Jo, 2006, Ren et al., 1999; Roberts et al., 2006), and work places (Chang et al., 2001, Kalogerakis et al., 2005, Kim et al., 2007, Lacey and Crook, 1988, Law et al., 2001). Most previous studies show a wide range of the number concentrations of total culturable bioaerosols in indoor air environments and the results of those studies indicate the necessity of continuous monitoring and studying the indoor bioaerosol concentrations.",

Recently, increasing attention has been paid to the relationship between bioaerosols and the atmosphere. It is well known that the atmosphere is a conveyor of bioaerosols. However, it is also a site where significant microbial processes can take place during transport (Sattler et al., 2001). Bioaerosol particles in the atmosphere have been known to impact on the formation of clouds. Bioaerosol particles can act as ice or cloud nuclei in clouds (Huffman et al., 2013, M\u00f6hler et al., 2007, Pratt et al., 2009). Despite the importance of outdoor bioaerosol concentrations from the perspective of public health and atmospheric sciences, the current practical measurements of the concentration of bioaerosols are rare and it remains insufficient (Menetrez et al., 2007, Yeo and Kim, 2002). In particular, quantitatively measured data for special events are scarce.",

We focus on the effect of rain on bioaerosols among many specific events. Rain has been widely known to remove aerosol particles in air environments. The aerosol particles were captured and removed from the air by a rain event and the concentration of aerosol particles significantly decreased after rain events. Therefore, rain is considered to have a favorable effect on air environments in terms of the respiratory health of the public. However, rain events such as a long term monsoon, cause an increase in the humidity of the air environments. The humidity increase can affect the growth of the bioaerosols (Jones & Harrison, 2004). Therefore, a bioaerosol living environment may be created during this season. Furthermore, rain that may trigger bioaerosol emissions due to droplet splash vibrations can increase bioaerosol concentrations by the convective lifting of bioaerosols into the ambient air. To verify this hypothesis of the increase of bioaerosol concentrations in a monsoon season, the change in the concentrations of bioaerosols caused by rain events was evaluated in this study as an initial step for studying effects of rain on bioaerosols. We collected data before, during, and after rain events in a monsoon season in Seoul, Republic of Korea, where tens of millions people live currently. We measured the number of concentrations of total culturable fungal and bacterial bioaerosols in three outdoor air environments \u2013 in the forest, by the lake, and near a building \u2013 via a standard measurement method provided by the Ministry of Environment of the Republic of Korea. An indoor air environment \u2013 inside the lecture building of Konkuk University \u2013 was also chosen for measurements to compare with the data from the outdoor air.",

Concentrations of fungal bioaerosols during rain were approximately seven times those in non-rainy days. This pattern was also observed in concentrations of bacterial bioaerosols. These results indicate that concentrations of fungal and bacterial bioaerosols outside the building increased during rain events. These increases in concentrations of culturable fungal and bacterial bioaerosols during rain can be explained as follows: First, bioaerosols drop from clouds during rain. Second, particles of bioaerosols splash on the ground. Third, effects of the ultraviolet (UV) ray decrease. Fourth, an increase in humidity fosters environments friendly to fungi and bacteria. These experimental results for quantitative concentrations of fungal and bacterial bioaerosols are expected to be useful for analyzing and developing methods to control bioaerosols. In addition, the results for outdoor concentrations of fungal and bacterial bioaerosols are expected to provide useful guidelines for public health policies. Additional experiments with varying environmental conditions, including confined conditions, are needed to better elucidate the mechanisms underlying the phenomena observed in this study.",
