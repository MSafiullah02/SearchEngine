While knowledge about CanL, its management, treatment, prevention and control mounts, it remains unclear whether all clinical veterinarians follow the same international recommendations, such as those of the LeishVet group. This study was thus designed to assess recent trends in the clinical management of CanL in veterinary clinics across Spain through a questionnaire-based survey. Results were compared with those of a prior national multicenter questionnaire administered by our research team in 2005.",

The disease is transmitted by female blood-feeding phlebotomine sand flies, and dogs (Canis familiaris) are both its natural host and the major reservoir of infection for humans and other animals [1, 2] . The presence of L. infantum in felids and other animals has also been confirmed, although so far there are few data on these species despite being considered a potential secondary reservoir for the infection of humans and other animals [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . The closest example is the largest outbreak of human leishmaniasis known in Europe occurring in 2009 in the southwest of Madrid [8] in which hares (Lepus granatensis) and rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) were identified in xenodiagnostic and molecular diagnostic studies as reservoirs and held responsible for the transmission of human leishmaniosis [9, 10] . The epidemiological role of wildlife species has not yet been established [4, [11] [12] [13] yet several authors propose that these animals can act as sentinels as they indicate the risk of transmission to other animals (domestic and wild) or even to humans, highlighting the importance of the concept of \"One Health\" for the control of leishmaniosis [14] [15] [16] .",

Despite the large number of surveys sent (n = 1428), we consider that the number of veterinarians who answered was low. However, these results are more representative than those of our initial study in 2005 in which data were obtained from only 106 veterinarians across five Spanish provinces [25] . Moreover, in the 2005 study, the veterinarians surveyed worked only in areas showing a high endemicity of CanL, while this time low endemicity areas were also surveyed as in the studies of Bourdeau et al. [26] and Le Rutte et al. [27] .",

            "text": "Before asking about CanL, a question was included about other CVBD, and many of the veterinarians indicated they mainly detected CanL and ehrlichiosis. Nevertheless, other CVBD (e.g. dirofilariosis and piroplasmosis) were also reported. According to previous epidemiological studies, the presence of some vector-borne diseases is associated with geographical distribution [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Indeed, in this survey, dirofilariosis (South of Spain, East of Spain and Canary Islands) and piroplasmosis (North of Spain) were associated with this variable as suggested by others [29, [33] [34] [35] . According to these new results, CanL seems to be the most widely CVBD distributed in Spain. However, veterinarians working in areas showing a high or medium endemicity considered that the incidence of CanL remains stable, while those working in low CanL endemic areas indicated that cases of CanL have increased. This perception is similar to that described in other European countries that were until recently free of CanL, such as the UK or Germany [36] [37] [38] [39] . The reason for this is unknown, but could be due to (i) the increased transfer of infected dogs from endemic areas, such as rehomed or hunting dogs; (ii) more dogs travelling overseas to Leishmania-endemic areas (e.g. taken there by their owners on holiday); (iii) other non-vector routes of transmission such as vertical, venereal, blood transfusion or dog-to-dog [40] [41] [42] [43] which may be contributing to the spread of autochthonous cases. The reason could also be a combination of these factors. The clinical manifestations of CanL vary from subclinical to severe disease. In the present study, weight loss, lymphadenomegaly and exfoliative dermatitis were frequently observed in agreement with the findings of other studies and surveys [25, 26, [44] [45] [46] [47] . While renal disease, vasculitis, ocular and join disease have been observed less frequently, these are indicators of a worse prognosis because they are clinical signs related to immunocomplex deposition [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] . Additionally, other clinical signs have been sporadically observed such as neurological signs [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] or digestive disorders [58] [59] [60] . Although these signs could due to CanL, other diseases must be considered in the differential diagnosis.",

It should be noted that more than 35% of the practitioners surveyed mentioned they had never performed an etiological diagnosis, and if this was done, the most common method used was PCR on blood samples or cytology on lymph node aspirates. Cytology (5.3%) or PCR (3.9%) on bone marrow aspirates were infrequently used for an etiological diagnosis. Similar results have been obtained in questionnaire surveys by other authors [26, 46] . However, according to the LeishVet group, blood is one of the least sensitive biological samples, and the use of bone marrow or lymph node aspirates is strongly recommended [2, 61] . Bourdeau et al. [26] suggested veterinarians could reject the more invasive techniques due to the extra costs and the fact they are time-consuming as in some cases it will be necessary to sedate the animal. Other authors suggest a lack of referral laboratories close to veterinary practices surveyed as the reason for the reduced use of molecular techniques [62] . However, we found no difference in the approach used according to the location of the veterinary practice.",

While a rapid test may help confirm clinically suspected cases as they show high specificity in sick dogs, the indirect fluorescent antibody test and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay are the most suitable serological tools according the LeishVet group and OIE [2, 64] , as confirmed by several authors [65] [66] [67] . In other surveys conducted in Spain and other CanL endemic countries (e.g. Italy), IFAT was considered the gold standard by veterinary practices surveyed [45] [46] [47] .",

These rates are significantly higher than those of our previous survey [25] , and indicate the improved clinical management of CanL as suggested by the LeishVet group [2, 21] . Regarding the use of urinalysis, ranges of 25.5-33.9% to 21.5-37.4% used urine strip and urinalysis, respectively. Also, 27.2-34.0% frequently or systematically, respectively, determined the UPC. This is important, as according to LeishVet and IRIS guidelines, UPC is a highly suitable biomarker for diagnosis of CanL because immunocomplex deposits in the renal glomerulus may induce immune-mediated glomerulonephritis. In sick dogs, this serious kidney lesion causes proteinuria with or without azotemia and chronic renal disease or even nephrotic syndrome of worse prognosis [68, 69] . Another important complementary diagnosis is abdominal ultrasound which was performed frequently during CanL followup by 6.4-14.6% of the veterinarians surveyed. These diagnostic methods (UPC and ultrasound) were not included in other surveys but the present responses suggest that veterinarians have access to this new information on the clinical management of CanL via the LeishVet guidelines, IRIS guidelines and specialized conferences [2, 21, 69, 70] .",

The results of the present survey suggest veterinarians frequently use the combination of meglumine antimoniate and allopurinol, followed by miltefosine, in accordance with a previous questionnaire survey [47] . The long-term use of allopurinol, in combination with n-methylglucamine antimoniate or miltefosine, has proved to be effective for maintaining clinical and parasitological improvement and delaying relapses in treated dogs. Miltefosine is better tolerated with regard to liver and kidney function. There is scarce information regarding possible toxicity of antimonials, and some authors have suggested possible kidney and liver secondary effects [71] [72] [73] . It is also true, however, that disease relapse occurs much earlier in dogs treated with miltefosine [73, 74] . Therefore, although available data are controversial, miltefosine could be recommended for treatment of canine leishmaniosis patients with renal or liver disease, and/or when subcutaneous or parenteral therapy may not be administered or is not indicated [73] [74] [75] [76] .",

In the 2005 survey, 100% of veterinarians asked about vaccination answered that if there were a vaccine available, they would use it. In this survey, 87.6% replied they recommended vaccination as a preventative measure. Further, it is remarkable that the most common vaccine used by veterinarians surveyed is Let-iFend \u00ae and not Canileish \u00ae . This lower use than initially expected could be because its percentage effectiveness is c.70% [83] . In addition, Canileish \u00ae needs to be given for primovaccination as three consecutive doses three weeks apart to develop an adequate immune response while LetiFend \u00ae is a single dose even for primary vaccination. This vaccine is also a DIVA (Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals) vaccine, allowing to discriminate vaccinated from infected dogs. For all these reasons, Let-iFend \u00ae is at the first-line vaccine option over Canileish \u00ae , as reflected in the results of other surveys [84] [85] [86] .",

However, a high percentage of veterinarians stated they never performed any test before revaccination so it cannot be known if a dog has been infected during the inter-vaccination period. This test is strictly necessary since vaccines do not protect 100% [83] . On the other hand, the results of the present survey indicate that more veterinarians carry out rapid tests before vaccination. Although rapid tests have a good sensitivity and specificity, quantitative techniques are considered more sensitive. Thus, a quantitative test is always recommended before vaccination to ensure the vaccination of healthy animals, as sometimes dogs with low antibody titres are not detected using qualitative techniques [83, 89] due to their lower sensitivity.",

However, in some cases, a veterinarian will recommend euthanasia for humanitarian reasons, especially when there is renal disease or other associated diseases. According to the present survey, an owner will usually request euthanasia when there are small children, or immunocompromised or elderly persons at home, and when a dog lives in a shelter. The educational role of veterinarians is essential to explain the life-cycle of the parasite and how other animals or people could acquire the infection, highlighting the importance of control and prevention measures [21, 22] . Veterinarians also need to make owners aware that culling CanL positive dogs is not an adequate disease control measure, as confirmed in studies conducted in Brazil where culling seropositive dogs failed to reduce the incidence of canine or human leishmaniosis [90] [91] [92] .",
