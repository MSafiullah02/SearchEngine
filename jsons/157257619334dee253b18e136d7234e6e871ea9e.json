Such viruses are then captured and killed by glial cells in the OB, resulting in glial production of inflammatory mediators. These mediators, in turn, induce a cascade of proinflammatory cytokines in neurons and glia within olfactory cortical pathways and beyond with the potential to damage the neurons. The resulting brain damage is too limited to provoke classical neurological symptoms, but it accumulates over the individual's lifetime and can potentially contribute to the development of late-life NDs in geneticallyor age-susceptible individuals.

A wide variety of brain insults, both extrinsic [21] and intrinsic, can induce acute neuroinflammation (see Table 1 ); many of these insults occur through inhalation ( [21, 22] , Table  1 ) and can potentially cause OB pathology (see ''Tutorial on olfactory system anatomy\"). While this article will focus on commonly-encountered viruses, it is likely that any systemic inflammatory event [23] , inhaled toxic chemicals ( [22, 24, 25] , Table 1), or head trauma [26] [27] [28] will amplify neuroinflammation by inducing additive or synergistic inflammatory events [22, 24] .

This schematic outlines the hypothetical sequence of events involved in induction of neuroinflammation by viruses associated with common colds, flu-like infections, or other routine viral infections replicating in the upper respiratory tract.

Text in rounded stippled boxes identifies important host factors affecting outcomes, such as immune status (which may determine the success of the viral invasion process), inflammation genotype (which may influence the severity and persistence of neuroinflammation), or inflammation status (such as ongoing systemic or neuroinflammation from the infection itself or chronic inflammatory disorders). Underlying the hypothesis is the widely accepted concept that sufficiently severe neuroinflammation can lead to neuronal degeneration. 1 Neuroinflammation is often defined as a state of glial activation that results in the secretion of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators within the brain in the absence of inflammatory exudates [15] -this definition generally applies to acute conditions and is employed in the discussion to follow. However, the term is also used to describe persistent brain inflammation that may involve activated leukocytes that have crossed the blood-brain barrier.
