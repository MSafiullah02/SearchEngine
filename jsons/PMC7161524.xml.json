            "text": "As I write this editorial for our special issue, Multiscale Modeling of Chromatin, we are surrounded in a world of concern and social distancing related to the coronavirus pandemic. I recall, as if in a dream, the seemingly care-free world of just one year ago, when we enjoyed an international gathering and breathtaking scenery in the French Alps during our wonderful BPS Thematic Meeting in Les Houches (see group photos in Figs. 1 and 2\n), which inspired this collection of articles. The meeting was co-organized by Thomas Bishop, Lars Nordenskiold, Andrzej Stasiak, and I. As I wrote in a summary of that meeting for the BPS Bulletin:With Mont Blanc in the background reminding participants of the lofty meeting goals, the meeting brought together \u223c70 biologists, chemists, physicists, and mathematicians to discuss and launch collaborations and advance the field of chromatin structure, dynamics, function, and applications through new conceptual approaches and perspectives. Notably, the meeting merged experimentalists with theoreticians and modelers in the program seamlessly, emphasizing the interplay between techniques and ideas ... [The] themes underscored the complex multiscale features and properties of chromatin, from DNA to nuclear organization and interactions, inspiring scientists to discuss the development of models and experimental strategies on many spatial and temporal scales needed to address all relevant components of the chromatin folding problem and the epigenomic regulation of gene expression. Such multiscale approaches, combining experimental data and modeling and informatics, are necessary to extract and identify structure and function relationships on various scales, from individual base pairs to whole genomes, and to pursue important applications in medicine and genomics. ... While we enjoyed warm sunny spring weather for the first couple days, the third day brought a heavy winter snow storm, burying us in over a foot of snow and encouraging cozy indoor discussions\n",
