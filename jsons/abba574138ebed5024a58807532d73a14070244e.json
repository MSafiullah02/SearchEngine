However, the beneficial effects by interferon-b treatment in MS, although suggested to depend mainly on immunomodulation, might lend support to a viral involvement in the pathogenesis. The human herpesviruses have attracted interest since their recurrent modes of infection share some similarity with the relapsing-remitting course of MS, most members are readily detected within the brain, and several of these viruses may induce demyelination within the central nervous system in human hosts as well as in animal models. Accumulated diagnostic and epidemiological data are compatible with a role for the herpesviruses as possible cofactors rather than etiological agents, and recent studies showing early neuronal damage in MS patients focus attention on the neurotropic a-herpesviruses.
