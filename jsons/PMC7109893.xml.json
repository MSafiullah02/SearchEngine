            "text": "Coronaviruses infect a wide range of animals and cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurological diseases of varying severity [1]. They cause severe diseases in livestock animals and thereby lead to high economic losses [2]. Based on genotypic and serological characterization, coronaviruses are divided into 4 distinct groups. Their tendency for recombination and high mutation rates may allow their adaptation to new hosts and ecological niches [3., 4., 5., 6.]. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the coronavirus of chickens, is one of the foremost causes of economic losses for the poultry industry, affecting the performance of meat and egg-laying birds, mainly through respiratory signs and severe egg drop and poor quality, respectively [7]; kidney damage can also occur [4, 8]. Infectious bronchitis virus has the ability to change rapidly [9]. In Tunisia, where the poultry industry is of great importance socially and economically, IBV remains one of the main causes of infectious disease-related economic losses, although vaccination programs based on live H120 strain vaccine are being used [10]. Despite the development of vaccines that contribute to the control of the clinical disease, the emergence of novel infectious bronchitis (IB) variant viruses make it difficult to control it, as no cross-protection exists between various IB strains [4].",

            "text": "To understand epidemiological conditions and virus changes, efforts have been undertaken since 2000 to isolate and type IBV field strains. Modern intensive poultry production practices in Tunisia have contributed to the presence of new IBV variants, which can evade the immune response induced by the commercial H120 vaccine, the only vaccine in use in the country [10], as multiple IBV serotypes are recognized worldwide [11, 12]. Previous studies in Tunisia indicated that these field IBV variants arise from recombination, insertions, deletions, and point mutation events, especially in the S1 gene (spike glycoprotein gene) resulting in the generation of 5 Tunisian IBV variants TN20/00, TN200/01, TN335/01, TN296/07, and TN556/07 [13, 14]. Pathogenicity testing was important and showed that these field isolates produced typical lesions in the respiratory tract and severe damages in the kidney of infected birds. The TN20/00 variant was identified as a nephropathogenic IBV, not related to the Massachusetts serotype and showing higher pathogenicity [10]. Serological and molecular studies confirmed that the Tunisian IB variant viruses isolated from vaccinated chicken flocks are genetically different from the vaccine in use [14]. In a sero-surveillance survey in vaccinated flocks, low levels of antibodies were found, indicating vaccination failures; 45 to 69% of the flocks showed positive levels of antibodies and only 5 to 15% of these were protected [10]. In general, vaccination fails and incidence of IB outbreaks are highly associated to the vaccination process of each country, independent of the virus strain [15]. In fact, the type of virus strain infecting a flock determines the pathogenesis of the disease and the outcome of the infection is closely dependent on the immune status of the host [4, 16, 17].",

Challenged-vaccinated or -unvaccinated groups comprised 20 to 40% of the birds with a score of 2, indicating severe congestion of the lungs, liver, and spleen, and 20 to 80% with a score of 3, indicating renal lesions. Group 1 (H120 and CR88 vaccinated-challenged) showed a lower percentage of chickens with kidney damages than the group 2 (H120 double vaccinated-challenged), scored as 3 for 20 and 60% of the birds, respectively. The difference between groups 1 and 2 was significant (P < 0.05). Groups 3 (H120 vaccinated-challenged) and 4 (CR88 vaccinated-challenged) presented lesions scored as 3 for 70 and 60% of the birds, respectively. The analysis of postmortem results confirmed significant differences between group 1 and groups 2, 3, 4, and 6 (P < 0.05). When the TN20/00 variant was used to challenge birds, vaccinated chickens in group 1 were protected, whereas chickens in group 2, 3, and 4 were not protected. In fact, based on the high percentage of mortality and trachea, lung, and kidney damages, the birds vaccinated with only the H120 vaccine (group 2) presented 70% of lesions scored 3, which we interpreted as a lack of cross-protection between H120 and TN20/00 strains. Whereas the results indicated good protection against challenge with TN20/00 when the CR88 variant vaccine was administered at 14 d of age to chickens vaccinated with H120 at d 1 (group 1). Low clinical signs and lesion scores were observed in birds from group 1 as compared with those of groups 2, 3, 4, and 6 (P < 0.05). However, the presence of severe damages in birds double vaccinated with H120 (group 2), with no significant difference compared with that afforded by H120 vaccination at d 1 (group 3), denotes a lack of complete protection in these groups; however, improvement in the level of protection was noted when comparing these findings to those observed in birds vaccinated with only CR88 at 14 d old (group 4). The renal lesions observed in dead birds of groups 4 and 6 (60 and 80% scored as 3, respectively) were expected because of the renal tropism of the coronaviruses CR88 and TN20/00, in addition to their respiratory tropism described in previous studies [10, 33].",

[13, 14], showed by sequencing and phylogenetic analyses that the S1 gene sequence similarities between H120 and local IBV strains did not exceed 64% and TN20/00 was widely distant from H120 genotype but more related to CR88 type, indicating that the variation in IBV S1 gene sequences are a good predictor of challenge immunity. The results in the current study suggest that S1 protein is responsible for the protective effect of vaccination with 2 different IBV vaccines against viral challenge in chickens.",

            "text": "General performances and WG of the tested flocks on one side and the level of postvaccination Ab production on the other side showed that association of H120 with CR88 ameliorated bird immunity level. In fact, the resulting cross-protection induced higher levels of Ab associated with increased WG (71 g of BW in the assay flocks, B2, B3, and B4, compared with the control flock, B1) and good performance during the fattening period, including (1) no severe clinical signs in all the tested flocks throughout the study, (2) a decreased average of mortality, from 6 to 4.5%, between control B1receiving only H120 vaccine and tested flocks (B2, B3, and B4) receiving both vaccines (H120 and CR88), respectively (Table 4\n). The levels of Ab against IBV in each flock (20 samples per flock), presented as GMT (Table 5\n), indicated that all chickens had maternally derived Ab against IBV H120 at 1 d old (GMT titers ranged from 4,559 to 7,412). At 10 d of age, birds in all flocks showed decreasing levels of Ab. At 38 d of age the control flock (B1) showed 1,067 GMT titer, whereas birds vaccinated with H120 and boosted with CR88 (B2, B3, and B4) showed Ab levels ranging from 1,870 to 4,028 (average GMT titer was 2,692 for these flocks). Consequently, chickens receiving both vaccines produced higher Ab titers than birds of the control group. However, the variation between flocks receiving the same treatment indicated the heterogeneity of the immune response among birds of each flock (CV >50%). Based on the results of the present study and the challenge experiment results reported by others [9, 16, 24, 34], an adapted program using heterologous vaccines H120 and CR88 at 1 and 10 d of age, respectively, has given better results.",

Thus, the use of H120 vaccine at 1 d of age and CR88 at 10 to 14 d of age should be recommended in Tunisian farms, but more challenge experiments testing other commercial vaccines (such IB4-91, D274, and others) may be useful to select the suitable vaccine.2.Adapting such a program in broilers would provide an efficient protection to cover the whole fattening period and reduce economic losses caused by IBV field variant. Therefore, our results were interesting when considering the choice of adequate commercial vaccine strain for use.3.Because the extent to which IBV infection can cause economic losses depending on the virus strain, the chicken age at infection, nutrition, and environmental conditions within the poultry flock, biosecurity is likely to be insufficient, as the virus spreads rapidly. Consequently, the identification of newly introduced IBV serotypes or variant strains can be useful to modify prophylactic programs providing greater protection against enzootic strains, and the vaccination must be commonly practiced within the adapted program to the field needs.\n",
