IC is classified into standard precautions (SPs) and expanded precautions (EPs). SPs are implemented in all patients regardless of their diagnosis. SPs include hand hygiene, appropriate handling of bodily fluids and waste, and prevention of injuries with sharp objects. In contrast, EPs are applied in specific situations depending on the mode of disease transmission, i.e. contact, droplet, and airborne precautions [1].",

A recent literature review revealed that only one study, conducted in 2012 at the King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia, has examined knowledge of SPs among Saudi-Arabian medical students in their clinical years [2]. The researchers reported that participants\u2019 knowledge was low, and that self-directed learning and informal bedside practices were the main sources of knowledge. In contrast, many studies have addressed this crucial aspect of IC worldwide. In 2008, a study conducted at Rouen University, Normandy, France, reported differing levels of knowledge for different categorized domains (e.g., hand hygiene, nosocomial infection, and SPs) [3]. The study targeted four specialties (Medicine, Nursing, Radiography, and Physiotherapy). The best scores were related to SPs, and the university curriculum was the primary source of students\u2019 knowledge. Another study conducted in 2014 at the University of Tirana, Tirana, Albania, demonstrated that students in four specialties (Medicine, Physiotherapy, Radiography, and Nursing) had a moderate knowledge of IC [4]. Formal, in-class training was their main information source.",
