The authors were drafting this manuscript on the dates just about weeks ahead of the festival. It is therefore very meaningful to have the Chinese character Jia-shaped patch antenna presented in this article. The patch antennas embed Chinese character(s) into the antenna design, combining Chinese culture and antenna technology to realize the application of hidden antenna technology [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12] that is suitable for indoor wireless communications to date. Chinese hieroglyphs are the crystallization of the wisdom of the Chinese nation. They are a kind of inheritance, the most vivid and the most well preserved characters of the ancestors, and are their original way of describing things. A novel wideband Wang-shaped patch array was initially proposed in [4], whereas the Zhong- and the Guo-shaped artistic patch antenna were studied and developed in various contributions [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. Later on, the two-element Zhong-Guo array was also presented with good radiation characteristics [10], [11]. Jia (\u5bb6) is a hieroglyphic character and consists of two radicals. Its exterior part is shaped like a house roof at the top, whereas the inner part looks like a hog. The development of the ancient times was low, the chance of hunting and preying was great, and life was not guaranteed. People raised hogs in the house to prepare for food and prevent famine. As such, a hog is symbolized in the house.",

In the past decades, numerous antennas were proposed for dual-band CP operations [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. In 2001, a dual-band CP radiation was achieved by inserting four T-shaped slits at the edges of a single-feed square patch [13]. A S-shaped slotted square patch was proposed for GPS applications [14], where a small frequency-band ratio of 1.28 was attained. In [15], a pair of L-shaped stubs was loaded outside a truncated square patch fed by a meandering probe, so that a pair of",

In [16], a rotated rectangular patch stacked with a circular patch excited by aperture feed was presented for dual-band CP (2.26/2.67-GHz) operation. A dual-band (0.92/2.45-GHz) RFID antenna comprises two stacked ring-patches excited by a hybrid complicated feed network was introduced [17]. Moreover, an EBG resonator antenna was proposed for dual-band CP (9.65/11.75-GHz) operation [18]. A modified stacked patch with dual band (1.62/2.49-GHz) and dual sense was proposed for BeiDou navigation systems [19], wherein a small antenna profile was accomplished. In [20], a dual-band CP reconfigurable antenna was proposed by using a novel dual-layer metasurface, whereas a wideband CP (3-dB axial ratio bandwidth of 70%) reconfigurable antenna was presented in [21]. However, these aforementioned dual band or wideband CP antennas were not the artistic antennas. The artistic patch antennas such as the Chinese-character-shaped patch antennas imposed additional design constraints from the character shapes.

The Jia-character was developed as a type of pictographic characters so that its shape has an irregular yet asymmetrical geometry about x- or y-axis. The Jia-shaped patch was printed using a 0.035-mm thin copper-foil. It has an overall (point-to-point) size of 79.2 mm (W1) and 80 mm (W2) in a near-square grid. A rectangular patch (R-patch) of size of Ra \u00d7 Rb was printed on the bottom-side of the dielectric substrate. Namely, the Jia-patch was arranged to stack on top of the R-patch (Fig. 1). The dielectric substrate was suspended over the copper ground plane of size of 100 mm\u00d7100 mm at a height of H. The geometric description of the artistic shape of Jia-patch was managed by using the coordinate vertex [22], with respect to the geometrical center (0, 0) of the R-patch, as shown in Fig. 1. The detailed geometrical parameters and coordinate points (vertexes) are summarized in Table 1\n. These implicitly give the relative position between two patches. To facilitate the effective feed to patches\u2019 coupling using a single feed, a novel 3D L-shaped feeding probe was delicately included to capacitively excite the patches via an air-gap (g). The relative position between the patches and the feed location (fp) were optimized with respect to the center of the R-patch. The 3D L-probe consists of two equal-length horizontal arms (denoted left- and right-arm) placed orthogonal each other, whereas its right arm is oriented at an angle (\u03b8) with respect to x-axis.",

Based on this principle, the feed position of the 3D L-probe was optimized to obtain the high-low axial ratios below 3-dB. Namely, two pairs of near degenerate orthogonal modes were generated independently at the desired center frequencies. The Jia-patch is mainly liable for the creation of lower band emission whereas the R-patch is responsible for the higher band generation. We may consider that the irregular shape of the Jia-patch has negative perturbations removed from a near-square patch. Meanwhile, the left arm of the 3D L-probe is liable for the feed of R-patch and the Jia-patch, whereas the right arm is solely coupled to the Jia-patch (Fig. 1). An equivalent circuit was developed to illustrate the coupling mechanism of the artistic antenna as shown in Fig. 2\n, wherein the Mode 1 and Mode 2 represent the pairs of orthogonal modes of the patches. The use of orthogonal arms was deliberate to raise the effective coupling between the feed and the patches. A comparison of impedance matching using 3D L-probe is shown in Fig. 3\n, where the S11 performance of the 3D L-probe outperforms the conventional L-shaped feeding probes [23], [24], [25].",

Four locations were selected to display in Figs. 5(c), 5(d) and 5(f) for comparison.

When the Jia-patch moved to right by 1 mm, the lowest AR changes whereas their frequencies shift down by 20-30 MHz. Moreover, ARs went up with decreased frequencies as the Jia-patch moved up by 1 mm (Fig.11(b)). For S11 performance, the high-band performances are more sensitive in the movement along y-axis.

One is the necessary condition that the magnitudes of electric field components (E\n\u2205, E\n\u03b8) must be equaled in the dual band, whereas the second one is the sufficient condition that their phase difference must be \u00b190\u00b0. When the phase of E\u2205 leads E\u03b8 by +90\u00b0, a left-hand CP is produced. Conversely, when E\u2205 lags E\u03b8 by 90\u00b0, a right-hand (RH) CP is created. Fig. 14\nplots the simulation results of these E-field components both in magnitude ratio and phase difference at the lower (2.6 GHz) band and the upper (3.4 GHz) band. From these plots we know that the RHCP is generated in both the bands.",

As a common practice, the reflection coefficient (S11) was measured before the measurement of far-field performance took place. S11 was undertaken by using the Keysight performance network analyzer N5222A, whereas the measurement of far-field performance metrics was carried out inside the near-field chamber SATIMO StarLab at the Qingdao University of Technology. Figure 14 displays a photograph of the Jia-shaped patch antenna that was under measurement in the chamber, whereas the radiation patterns in two principal planes/cuts are shown in Fig. 15\n, wherein the simulated patterns were verified by the measured ones. As seen, the RHCP co-polarization were obtained in the desired dual frequency band, which are corroborated with the prediction from the simulation. Moreover, the maximum power directions of the main beams in the elevation (yz) plane are pointing to 15\u00b0 (Fig. 15(b)) and 18\u00b0 (Fig. 15(d)) in the low- and high-band, respectively. As a result, this artistic patch antenna exhibits the down-tilt beams in the dual band. This feature is highly desired for wall-mounted antennas, where additional mechanical tilting/mounting is not required during the installation. Indeed, this is one of the by-products from the Chinese-character-shaped patch antennas [5].",

Home gives importance in our life, as a recent example, home is a best place of isolation from the outbreak of novel coronavirus-2019. This article presents a novel Jia-shaped patch antenna printed in standard SimHei font for dual-band circular polarization at 2.6 and 3.4 GHz. A detailed design procedure as well as the working mechanism were described, in particular, the creation of pairs of near degenerate-orthogonal modes was achieved, such that a dual axial-ratio (3-dB) bandwidth was produced at 2.58-2.62 GHz and 3.37-3.42 GHz, wherein the maximum gain of 7.3 and 6.3 dBic was obtained, respectively. Moreover, the dual-band ratio of this artistic patch antenna can be adjusted by (i) changing the patches\u2019 sizes, and (ii) the relative position of the stacked patches. The parametric study indicates that when the Jia-patch size reduced by 5% and the rectangular patch size increased by 5%, the dual-band ratio can be reduced to 1.18. Finally, the down-tilt radiation is also a special feature of the proposed dual-band antenna.",
