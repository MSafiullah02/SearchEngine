Furthermore, these two cases performed strictly quarantine in home for more than two weeks after discharge. There was no evidence of re-infection and person-to-person transmission during this time. Two consecutive negative nucleic acid tests over a one-day interval was the most important criteria for discharge from the isolation ward. We report here that these two cases met the criteria of the sixth guidelines of the national health commission. The false negative rate of this nucleic acid test has been previously documented [3, 4] . Some patients manifested typical chest CT imaging of COVID-19, without positive nucleic acid results [4] .

The 7th edition of the guidelines revised and further emphasized the importance of CT examination in discharge criteria [5] . The acute bilateral pulmonary exudative lesions significantly diminishing was included in the new revision. We considered that this more strict criterium might compensate for the false negative rate of the nucleic acid test to some extent. Furthermore, the serial CT features may help evaluate the changes in lesions and offer more valuable clinical information. The density, however, was more likely to show changes in lesions rather than the number or area. By observing serial CT images, patients without significant decreases in lesions need additional time before repeated nucleic acid tests to diminish the false negative rate.",
