In studies that have identified bacteria found in air it was determined that the majority of airborne bacteria are nonpathogenic, but even dead airborne bacteria can provide a burden on respiratory tract defenses that would make lung tissues more susceptible to infections.47 Human work environments with high levels of nonpathogenic bacteria have been associated with a higher risk of the development of respiratory disease.48\n",

            "text": "Although not commonplace in the United States, group housing of unweaned calves is becoming more prevalent, especially with the increased awareness of animal welfare and with computer milk-feeding stations being more readily available. Previous work has associated the use of computer milk feeders with an increased incidence of respiratory disease, although the role of stocking density was not evaluated in those trials.50 More recent work has suggested that housing computer-fed calves in groups of 10 or less results in improved growth and less morbidity associated with respiratory disease.51 These findings agree with others that have suggested limiting group size in both unweaned and weaned calves to groups of less than 7 results in the best overall welfare for the calves.52 Further research is needed to determine whether this apparent group size effect is related to better social welfare of the calves in smaller groups or an effect of stocking density as a factor of barn volume. Stocking rate in a given volume of area is an important variable in total airborne pathogen load,53, 54 with a lower stocking rate reducing respiratory morbidity6 (Thomas Earlywine, PhD, presentation notes, Land O Lakes, Webster City, IA, January 2010). Ventilation requirements do not have a linear relationship with stocking density. A twofold increase in stocking density requires nearly a tenfold increase in ventilation capacity to maintain pathogenic bacteria levels at similar concentrations.54 This layout proves to be especially problematic in calf barns that are designed to be naturally ventilated or ventilated by negative pressure. These types of barns may not provide adequate ventilation at the level of the calf's environment. Positive pressure ventilation systems similar to those described in the previous section may be necessary to adequately ventilate buildings housing groups of unweaned and weaned calves.49 Calves housed in buildings should have 2.3 to 2.8 m2 or more of space available per calf.42\n",

The newborn calf has a functional immune system that is able to respond to antigens, provided maternal antibody is not present.

However, this should not be construed as a suggestion that necropsy examinations should not be completed if acutely-affected animals are not available for necropsy. Results of these examinations can provide critical information to determine deficiencies in management, such as nutritional insufficiency, and can be an important tool in client education.
