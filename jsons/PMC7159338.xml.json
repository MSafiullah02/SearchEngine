Its fluorescence is greatly enhanced when spontaneously inserting into membranes.2 However, due to its small size, it is susceptible of release from the viral envelope with time, thereby leading to fluorescence signal dilution. Recently, P\u00e9cheur's group, developing strategies using octadecyl\u2010Rhodamine B chloride (R18), strengthened the observation that HCV enters hepatocytes by clathrin\u2010dependent endocytosis and unraveled the mechanisms of action of two antiviral molecules.3, 4 However, the fluorescence signal of this molecular lipid probe is again rapidly diluted intracellularly, preventing the long\u2010term tracking of labeled viral particles.",

The binding reaction was monitored by SEC with a double refractometric/UV\u2013vis detection, the bound dye appearing at a smaller elution volume (6.2 mL) than the free dye (8 mL) (Figure\n\n1\nA). The ratio between the two peaks enabled determination of the binding yield. The reaction was slow but could be accelerated by a supplementary equivalent of DIPEA after 3 h. No further improvement occurred after addition of a third equivalent after 1 d (Figure 1B). The kinetics reached a plateau with a 86% binding yield after 4 d (Table\n\n1\n). The difference between the binding yields of A onto lipid\u2010 or nonlipid\u2010ended polymers (60% vs 86%, respectively), could be explained by a less favorable conformation of the chain in DMF due to the apolar character of the lipid end\u2010group, rendering activated ester functions less accessible.",

Concerning \u03a6, it is generally expected to decrease when the local dye concentration increases, due to self\u2010quenching.13 This is indeed observed here, as the dye density along the polymer chain increases.7 However, \u03a6 value of the bound dye still represents 66%\u201376% of the free dye one, reflecting a positive influence of the carboxylate groups along the chain that favor an extended conformation of the polymer chain due to electrostatic repulsions, thereby limiting the occurrence of dimer formation (usually nonfluorescent).

Yet, several stages of its interactions with host cells remain ill\u2010defined, and most importantly, hepatocytes are autofluorescent cells, which precludes the use of probes emitting in the visible range for observations by optical microscopy.16, 17, 18 Labeling of a surrogate model of HCV, HCV pseudoparticles (HCVpp), with our far\u2010red lipid\u2010polymer probes was more stable and reproducible than using a commercial probe (Figure 4). As a direct consequence, a strong fluorescence signal was observed with a very high contrast, enabling visualization of virions for several minutes without loss of contrast. A complementary immunofluorescence assay confirmed the specificity of virion labeling, that is, observed particles consisted in fully enveloped virions containing a capsid. The only discriminating parameter was the presence of the lipid end\u2010group in the polymer probe architecture (Figure 5). In addition, labeling with the polymer probes did not alter the morphology nor the integrity of pseudotyped virions (Figure 3), and minimally affected their infectivity (Figure 6A). This strongly contrasts with the 200\u2010fold loss of infectivity of HCV labeled with DiD, as observed by Randall and co\u2010workers.2 We confirmed that our labeling strategy did not alter the biological properties of virions, since they appeared to be internalized by clathrin\u2010dependent endocytosis, as previously reported (Figure 7).2, 3, 4\n",

Another strategy based upon the metabolic labeling of enveloped virions by azido sugars during infection was successfully developed.24 However, it modifies the glycosylation profile of envelope glycoproteins, with the risk of altering their functional properties. By comparison, our small size biocompatible polymer probes (<10 nm) appear as safe means to label virions.",
