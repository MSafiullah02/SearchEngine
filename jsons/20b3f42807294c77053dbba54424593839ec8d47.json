Despite a protocolized antibiotic use, the clinical cure rates are about 60% with a high recurrence rate. This can be attributed partly to the prevalence of infection with MDR pathogens like Enterobacter, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebseilla pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae (ESKAPE bugs).",

            "text": "(a) Selection of empiric antibiotic therapy should be based on the following: \u2022 Patient risk factors for infection with MDR pathogens The classical distinction and treatment of ventilator associated pneumonia based on early and late onset VAP concept seems inappropriate as it may result in low intensity treatment for multi-drug resistant pathogens that are commonly seen in early onset VAP as well as aggressive high intensity treatment in late onset VAP on the assumption that it is always caused by resistant pathogens. No significant difference in pathogens have been found between early & late onset VAP. New guidelines suggest that the antibiotic therapy should focus on presence of risk factors for MDR pathogens rather than early or late VAP. It is suggested that hospital admission rather than intubation should be taken as the starting point. Step 6: Principles of Choosing an Antibiotic: (Fig. 13.1) 1. The 2016 IDSA/ATS guidelines recommend that the choice of empiric antibiotics should be based on local distribution of pathogens and the local antibiograms. otherwise MSSA cover should be provided. 4. Avoid the antibiotic class to which the patient has been recently exposed. 5. Use parenteral antibiotics. 6. Use antibiotics in adequate dose and frequency. It is suggested to use PK/PD data for antibiotic dosing. 7. Ventilator associated tracheobronchitis should preferably not be treated with antibiotic therapy. 8. Follow the antibiotic policy of your unit/hospital. 9. For starting antibiotic therapy in suspected VAP, clinical criteria alone should be used rather than clinical criteria + serum procalcitonin or CRP or CPIS. 10. The duration of antibiotic therapy should be seven days and not more. 11. Monitoring serial procalcitonin level can help guide the decision to discontinue antibiotic 12. Specific recommendations based on new guidelines: \u2022 If Piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, levofloxacin, imipenem or meropenem are being used for empiric cover, it is not necessary to add specific MSSA cover like oxacillin, nafcillin or cefazolin. \u2022 Piperacillin/Tazobactam used with Vancomycin has been associated with acute kidney injury. \u2022 Aminoglycosides, Polymyxins should be avoided in suspected VAP, if other gram negative antibiotics are available and provide adequate cover. \u2022 In cases of VAP due to gram negative bacilli susceptible only to aminoglycosides or Polymyxins, it is suggested to use both inhaled and intravenous (systemic) antibiotics rather than systemic antibiotics alone. \u2022 In cases of VAP due to Acinetobacter species, use a carbapenem or a BL-BLI (betalactam-beta lactam inhibitor) combination like ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam (if the isolate is susceptible to these antibiotics).",
