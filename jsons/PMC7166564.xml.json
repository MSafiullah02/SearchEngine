            "text": "It is hard to investigate how a concomitant infection or a recent viral infection could modulate the inflammatory response in children with bronchiolitis, without interfering with the severity of the clinical presentation. Given that RT\u2010PCR is unable to distinguish infectious virions, we cannot say whether coinfections are simultaneous or a detected virus is left over from a previous infection. Also the viral load and the different viral genotype could influence the clinical presentation,21 but further studies are needed to clarify whether these two factors are involved in the clinical presentation of bronchiolitis with multiple viral detection. In accordance with our previous findings,2 in our series infants hospitalized for hRV bronchiolitis alone more frequently had an eosinophil blood cell count higher than 400/mm3, and more frequently a higher prevalence of family history for atopy than in co\u2010infection, but not statistically significant. These findings could suggest that severe hRV infections preferentially manifest in infants predisposed to atopy.",

            "text": "We also evaluated the possible correlation between co\u2010infections and recurrent wheezing, hypothesizing that multiple viral infection might cause a more severe inflammation and this results in a higher recurrence of wheezing episodes. We found no association between co\u2010infection and recurrent wheezing, despite the higher family history for asthma, in patients infected with a mixed than with a single virus. This previously unreported finding suggests that recurrent wheezing after bronchiolitis depends on the type of virus the infants were found positive to, regardless of whether it was detected as a single or as a multiple virus. We previously reported a positive association between recurrent wheezing after bronchiolitis and hRV detection11 and in a later study a higher RSV\u2010RNA load.12 This issue merits clarification in a study with a larger number of cases and a longer follow\u2010up. In conclusion, our study shows that many infants with bronchiolitis (about 11%) in Rome, Italy are infected with multiple virus. No significant differences in clinical severity distinguish bronchiolitis in infants infected with single or multiple virus. Although co\u2010infected infants seem to mount a lower inflammatory response than those without co\u2010infections the immunological response to virus co\u2010infection merits further in vitro studies. Co\u2010infection seems not to influence the clinical presentation of bronchiolitis nor the recurrence of wheezing episodes after three years of follow\u2010up.",
