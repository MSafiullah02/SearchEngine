The MHV strain A59 (MHV\u2010A59) is a coronavirus that triggers in susceptible mice various pathologies, including hepatitis and thymus involution, B lymphocyte polyclonalactivation and, after intra\u2010cerebral inoculation, transient demyelination 3. MHV\u2010A59 causes IgG2a\u2010restricted hypergammaglobulinemia, although only a small fraction displays an antibody (Ab) activity against the virus itself 4. Furthermore, anti\u2010erythrocyte autoantibodies (autoAb) induced by immunization against rat red blood cells increased in MHV\u2010infected mice, indicating that the virus may enhance a concomitant autoimmune response 4.",

The homology between the several peptides is similar to that found between a Semliki Forest virus peptide and a myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 16 and Chlamydia peptides with a heart muscle\u2010specific protein 17. In the former case a viral peptide is responsible of an autoimmune demyelinating disease in mice 16, whereas heart disease was induced by a Chlamydia\u2010derived sequence 17, indicating that molecular mimicry could\nbe involved in the induction of autoimmune disease by pathogens.",
