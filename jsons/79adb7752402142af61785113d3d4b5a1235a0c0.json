As hospital resources and staff become more limited during the COVID-19 pandemic, it becomes critically important to define which BC patients require more urgent care and which patients can wait for treatment until the pandemic is over. In this Special Communication, we use expert opinion of representatives from multiple cancer care organizations to categorize BC patients into priority levels (A, B, C) for urgency of care across all specialties. Additionally, we provide treatment recommendations for each of these patient scenarios. Priority A patients have conditions that are immediately life threatening or symptomatic requiring urgent treatment. Priority B patients have conditions that do not require immediate treatment but should start treatment before the pandemic is over. Priority C patients have conditions that can be safely deferred until the pandemic is over. The implementation of these recommendations for patient triage, which are based on the highest level available evidence, must be adapted to current availability of hospital resources and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in each region of the country. Additionally, the risk of disease progression and worse outcomes for patients need to be weighed against the risk of patient and staff exposure to SARS CoV-2 (virus associated with the COVID-19 pandemic). Physicians should use these recommendations to prioritize care for their BC patients and adapt treatment recommendations to the local context at their hospital.",

Biopsies for lower suspicion lesions (BI-RADS 4a) may be postponed or biopsied. BI-RADS category 3 patients returning for short-term follow-up diagnostic mammogram and/or ultrasound and routine breast examination should be postponed until the COVID-19 pandemic is over and would be Priority C. All screening examinations including mammography, ultrasound, and MRI should be placed in Priority C and suspended until the post-COVID-19 period. BRCA mutation carriers under the age of 40 may be considered for screening if delays of more than 6 months are expected [3, 4] .

Current standards for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and human epidermal growth factor 2-overexpressing (HER2 +) BC already include neoadjuvant therapy, which has very high rates of clinical and pathological tumor response affording durable tumor control prior to deferred surgery [7, 8] Patients completing neoadjuvant chemotherapy are categorized as Priority B1. Delays of surgery up to 8 weeks postchemotherapy do not adversely affect BC outcomes [9] . Breast imaging cannot be used as a surrogate to assess pathologic response because false negative rates vary between 17.8 and 50% [10] [11] [12] [13] In the event that resources do not allow for surgery, additional non-surgical therapy should be considered (see Medical Oncology section).",

In contrast, delaying RT 20 weeks in early-stage, ER + patients after BCS demonstrates no difference in outcomes compared to 4-8 weeks (Priority B3) [48] . Since Priority B sub-stratifies by clinicalpathologic recurrence risk, B1 patients should be given priority over B2 or B3; hypofractionated (HF) regimens should be strongly considered whenever possible. Long-term outcomes with HF-RT utilizing 42.5 Gy/16 or 40 Gy/15 fractions demonstrate safety and efficacy similar to conventional fractionation which will reduce patient/staff exposure [45, 46] . Though regional-nodal and postmastectomy patients were under-represented in these trials, historic [49] and emerging [50] data suggest no differences in efficacy or toxicity for these sub-groups. Current trials are evaluating HF with reconstruction (Alliance221505/ NCT03414970; FABREC Trial/ NCT03422003). Furthermore, additional intensive regimens after lumpectomy (FAST: 28.5 Gy in 5 once-weekly fractions [51, 52] ; FAST Forward: 26 Gy in 5 fractions over 1 week [53] ) suggest early toxicity comparable to 40 Gy/15 fractions.

Other factors would be the proportion of healthcare personnel infected with SARS CoV-2, and whether BC treatment will put healthcare workers at risk.

These aforementioned factors will determine which BC patients receive treatment during or after the pandemic resolves.

Management of BC patients requires a highly integrated and multidisciplinary approach. An intervention in one specialty will have a direct impact on another specialty. For example, the American College of Surgeons issued a statement that elective surgeries should be canceled [17] . Fortunately, many BC patients do not need upfront surgical resection because of neoadjuvant treatment options. However, deferring BC cases will initially increase the medical oncologist workload and will result in a backlog of procedures when the pandemic resolves. For these reasons, multidisciplinary discussion documenting Priority category for surgery and/or adjuvant treatments is necessary to ensure the best outcomes for patients. If feasible, tumor board discussions should include both standard and COVID-19 recommendations based on institution's level of pandemic severity. Documentation of these discussions in the medical record is highly recommended.",
