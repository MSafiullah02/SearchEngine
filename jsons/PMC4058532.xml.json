Interestingly, the advent of genetic data has also triggered a number of methodological developments aiming to exploit different types of data simultaneously (Ypma et al., 2012; Morelli et al., 2012; Teunis et al., 2013; Jombart et al., 2014; Mollentze et al., 2014).

R is already hosting a growing number of packages for infectious disease epidemiology, including surveillance (H\u00f6hle, 2007) for temporal and spatio-temporal modelling (including outbreak detection), R0 (Obadia et al., 2012), TreePar (Stadler and Bonhoeffer, 2013) and EpiEstim (Cori et al., 2013) for reproduction number estimation, and outbreaker (Jombart et al., 2014) for transmission tree reconstruction.",

This software, initiated during a hackathon for the analysis of disease outbreaks in R (http://sites.google.com/site/hackoutwiki/), provides object classes implementing a flexible and coherent representation of outbreak data, alongside procedures to manipulate, summarize and visualize these data.

To achieve this goal, a new formal (S4) class \u2018obkData\u2019 (short for \u2018outbreak data\u2019) has been developed. This class uses different slots (Table 1) to store individual meta data (e.g. age, sex), time-stamped observations made on the individuals (e.g. fever, swab results, or answers on food exposures from questionnaires), contacts between patients, DNA sequences of the pathogen, phylogenetic trees, and contextual data at the population level (e.g. school closures, climatic variables). Complex data structures such as dynamic contact networks or DNA sequences from different genes are respectively stored using the new classes \u2018obkContacts\u2019 and \u2018obkSequences\u2019.",

The use of a formal (S4) class system offers multiple advantages in this respect, as it allows one to accurately define the object's content, and to perform consistency checks between the different data sources when the object is created. This means, for instance, that individuals documented in the contact or symptom data will be linked, through unique individual identifiers, to available individual meta-data, or that tips of the trees will be linked to existing DNA sequences whenever possible. Similarly, dates provided in different formats are automatically standardized, and sequences of the same genes are checked for consistent length. As obkData objects allow for coherent data storage and can be saved easily as compressed R objects (using the function save), they also offer a new and efficient way of sharing data amongst collaborators and making studies reproducible after publication.",

Importantly, decoupling the access to information from the internal data storage also ensures long-term code portability: future changes in the data structure will not affect results as long as accessors return the same information. This approach will enable future developments of the obkData class and allow for the incorporation of new types of data. Besides accessors, data handling is also facilitated by a subsetting procedure (function subset) which allows one to isolate data for given sets of individuals, samples, genes, sequences, or from a given time window.",

In the latter situation, positive cases can be defined from either quantitative or categorical data, by specifying a range of numerical values, a list of character strings or even regular expressions. In practice, this allows for the computation of incidence based on any symptom data or sample analysis.
