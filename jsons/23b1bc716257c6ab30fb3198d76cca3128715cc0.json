The newly infected data were fitted with Gaussian distribution with the peak at ~40 days for the countries whose infection curves are seem to be saturated. The similarity in growth kinetics of infected people of different countries provides first-hand guidelines to take proper precautions to minimize human damage.",

The factors like low air temperature and low humidity highly influence the transmission of COVID-19 [10, 11] . The population density, qualitative medical care, etc. also affect the control of COVID-19 [12, 13] . The outcome of all the factors and modes of transmission lead to the infection in human with suffering in pain and to the death in one hand. On the other hand, although there is no direct vaccine available to cure it, alternative medicines are used to treat the patients to recover [1, 2] .",

We observed that the values are very close to each other for all the models (see Fig. 4 ). The power index value ranges between 3.75 -32.23 for the top ten highly infected countries. As the cumulative infection curve of China and Republic of Korea are almost saturated, one can compare the exponent value of these two countries. The exponent is low (3.75) for China whereas for the Republic of Korea it is 12.01. The small exponent indicates the low infection rate i.e. the infection rate of China is relatively small as compared to Republic of Korea. For other countries the cumulative data is not reached to the saturation value, so the interpretation of the power index may be unrealistic. For example, in the case of the USA the exponent is quite high because there is a sharp increase of infection at this stage but it may slow down due to prevention and medical facility as time progresses. For better understanding, we have also analyzed the daily infection and that is fitted with a Gaussian distribution. While the data from China and Korea are well fit (see Fig.  6 (a,b) ), the data from Iran and Switzerland show the change in trend (may be achieving its peak) (Fig. 6 (c,d) ). But the data from the countries like Italy and USA shows the increasing in trend (Fig. 6 (e, f) ). The average mean are ~35 and ~40 days for China and Republic of Korea respectively. Although many factors (temperature, humidity, GDP, medical facilities, etc.) in other countries are different than that of China and Republic of Korea, they are trying best to control it. Irrespective of that the rate of infection is increasing till now. The rest of the countries data are shown in the Supporting Information. The global infected data of COVID-19 shows a power law behavior with exponent 1.7 (see Fig. 7 ). Although the spreading of coronavirus is different in the respective countries, they show a scale invariance behavior.",

The cumulative infection of top ten highly infected countries data are fitted with different equations and the power index are estimated. There is a similarity in the growth kinetics of infected people although the rate of infections is different due to various reasons. The infection curve of China and Republic of Korea has almost reached to its saturation value because of various reasons, for example medical facilities, prevention and public awareness etc. Further, the distribution of daily infected people is well fitted with Gaussian function. The cumulative infection data shows the scale invariance property. All the statistical analysis will provides firsthand guidelines to take proper precautions to minimize the infection rate. ",
