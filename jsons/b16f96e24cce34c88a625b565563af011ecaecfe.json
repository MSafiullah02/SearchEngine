Due to the inclusion of the center, these data are basically from large cities. But about 100 million residents around the world live above 2500 meters all year around [2] , the residents in high altitude areas may have pathophysiology changes especially in cardiopulmonary function [3] . If they are combined with COVID-19, these may cause more uncertainty to diagnosis and treatment. Given the rapid spread of COVID -19, we determined that an updated analysis of 68 cases from high altitude area from Sichuan province, which might help the physicians to learn more about the COVID-19. Images from all cases were collected and analyzed by two radiologists. Each segment of the lung was examined to determine whether there were Ground Glass Opacities (GGO), Consolidation, Mix GGO and Consolidation, reticular shadows, and the affected lung segment, range, location of the lesion, whether there was pleural effusion, and lymphadenopathy. We use semi-quantitative score system to evaluate the area of the lesion [4] . CT imaging features recorded from our cohort were summarized in supplementary Table 2 .",

However, among these patients, 6 severe patientsstill need oxygen therapy to relieve the dyspnea symptoms. We analyzed that these patients were older and combined more comorbidities than mild patients.
