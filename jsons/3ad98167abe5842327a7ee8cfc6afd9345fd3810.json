In children, the presence of fever and tonsillar exudate alone is a strong indicator of bacterial tonsillitis. Although NICE does not advocate routine use of throat swabs, they can be useful to exclude a diagnosis of bacterial tonsillitis in children and reduce inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics.",

            "text": "It is estimated that 90% of URTIs are selflimiting and caused by viruses, hence antibiotic use remains contentious. 20 Despite little evidence of benefit, antibiotic prescribing for children with uncomplicated URTIs remains widespread in the UK, with approximately 33% of childhood consultations for URTI resulting in an antibiotic prescription. 21, 22 Unnecessary antibiotic prescribing contributes to the increasing burden of antimicrobial resistance, which is a major public health concern. Parents' or carers' concerns and expec tations should be determined and addressed, and clinicians should consider the risks versus benefits of antibiotic prescrib ing. The NICE guidance on the prescribing of antibiotics for res piratory tract infections concludes that there is good evidence that antibiotics are of limited efficacy in treating the majority of URTIs and AOM in adults and children. 9 Delayed prescription of antibiotics is recommended in international guidance; NICE and PHE currently recommend using a strategy of either no antibiotic prescribing or delayed antibiotic prescribing for the management of uncomplicated sore throat and other URTIs Children presenting with sore throat who have a history of valvular heart disease Table 2 . Criteria for referral or immediate antibiotic prescription 4, [9] [10] [11] in children over three months of age once the child has had a thorough clinical examination of the tonsils. 9, 21 Unnecessary antibiotic prescribing within primary care is partly due to the inability to exclude bacterial infection. Rapid pointofcare (POC) tests that can be performed within the dura tion of a GP consultation could assist clinicians with the deci sion to prescribe antibiotics in the future. Rapid antigen tests that detect the presence of group A streptococcal antigen on a throat swab are currently available but they have poor sensitivity and hence have little impact on prescribing decisions. 11 Where antibiotic treatment is deemed necessary for sus pected bacterial tonsillitis, NICE and PHE recommend treatment with a 10day course of phenoxymethylpenicillin. For children with a true penicillin hypersensitivity, treatment with a fiveday course of clarithromycin or erythromycin is recommended. Macrolides have a broader spectrum of activity than phenoxy methylpenicillin and thus are more likely to drive the emergence of bacterial resistance. 11,13,23 Phenoxymethylpenicillin remains the antibiotic of choice for suspected bacterial tonsillitis, based on a combination of its proven efficacy, narrow spectrum, safety and cost effectiveness. 11,13 Phenoxymethylpenicillin is availa ble in a childfriendly suspension formulation (125mg/5ml or 250mg/5ml) and tablet formulation (250mg) for those children who are able to swallow. Dosage frequency is four times a day, ideally on an empty stomach. Phenoxymethylpenicillin is not particularly palatable, making compliance in children difficult. Amoxicillin and other broadspectrum antibiotics are not rec ommended for empiric treatment of sore throats in children; however, if adherence to phenoxymethylpenicillin is likely to be an issue, these alternatives may be considered, providing there is no possibility of glandular fever. 11 Antibiotic dosing recom mendations are outlined in Table 3 .",

Like amoxicillin, clarithromy cin is also available as a childfriendly suspension formulation (125mg/5ml or 250mg/5ml) and tablet formulation (250mg or 500mg) for those children who are able to swallow. Dosage frequency is twice daily, making clarithromycin a more practical option than erythromycin, which has a dosage frequency of four times daily. Clinicians should be aware of potential drug inter actions and take care when prescribing macrolides.",

Clinicians should ensure parents and carers are given advice on the natural history of the illness and they should be reminded of the importance of ensuring all antibiotic doses are given and the course is completed. Antibiotic liquids can be administered using either the measuring spoon provided or an oral syringe. For babies, parents and carers should be advised to administer doses down the side of the cheek and avoid mixing doses with feeds, as in the event that the whole feed is not taken, this may result in only a proportion of the dose being administered. For children attending nursery/school, a twice daily or threetimes daily antibiotic regimen may be pref erable to avoid needing to administer a dose during the nurs ery/school period. Administration of medicines in nurseries/ schools can be complex and if medications are required to be administered, they will need to be in their original containers and clearly labelled with the child's name and administration instructions.",

There is no evidence of benefit for the use of OTC cough and cold preparations and these should not be recommended. Despite the predominantly viral cause, chil dren are frequently prescribed antibiotics for the treatment of URTIs and AOM. Inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics contrib utes to the increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance, which is recognised as a major threat to public health. NICE and PHE recommend three antibiotic prescribing strategies for children presenting to primary care with symptoms of an uncomplicated URTI or AOM: no prescribing, delayed prescribing and immediate prescribing. The prescribing strategy should be decided based on the child's clinical presentation and should take into account any risk factors. Where the decision is made not to prescribe antibiotics, parents and carers should be offered reassurance that antibiotics are not required as they are unlikely to make a difference and may potentially cause sideeffects. They should be advised to return if symptoms worsen or become prolonged.",
