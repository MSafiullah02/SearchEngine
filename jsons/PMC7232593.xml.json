The instinct to \u2018shoot the messenger\u2019 has proved hard to overcome in a political system that has little tolerance of whistle-blowers or potentially destabilising social activism. And yet, when it became apparent that the threat posed by COVID-19 was so serious and obvious that it could not be concealed, China\u2019s authoritarian system rapidly mobilised and imposed draconian, transmission-inhibiting lockdowns in Wuhan and elsewhere (Graham-Harrison and Kuo 2020). Similar restrictions have proved more difficult to impose in other parts of the world.",

Confucian traditions, respect for social hierarchy and a relaxed attitude toward powerful states that \u2018intervene\u2019 in economic and even social affairs, are taken to be indicative of such \u2018Asian values\u2019. It is striking that, after being widely dismissed in the wake of the Asian financial crisis, such discourses are remerging, and are even promoted by precisely the same people at times (Mahbubani 2020). One of the most important potential consequences of the current crisis is that it will likely intensify the growing competition between \u2018the West\u2019 and other parts of the world, especially regarding the optimal forms of economic and political organization.",

Even before this pandemic struck, many had drawn unfavourable comparisons between China and the USA in their responses to, and role in actually creating the so-called \u2018global financial crisis\u2019 of the late 2000s (Breslin 2011). The disproportionally negative impact of the current pandemic on the USA, partly as a consequence of its notoriously inequitable and inefficient health system, and partly because of polarised, dysfunctional nature of American politics, has further undermined what remains of its \u2018soft power\u2019. Much of the blame for the unfolding American tragedy can be attributed to the manifold failings of President Trump (Frum 2020), no doubt, but the absence of leadership on the part of the USA threatens to undermine the foundations of an international order it did so much to create. Significantly, both Western Europe and East Asia are direct products of this order and will be affected profoundly if it unravels.",

Such differences, and the much greater expectations that Europeans have\u2014or more accurately, perhaps, had\u2014about their leaders to cooperatively respond to such crises, make their possible consequences that much greater. The EU was already in trouble before the pandemic hit with such force in Italy, Spain and France, a reality highlighted most dramatically in Britain\u2019s populist-inspired decision to leave. Now, there are very real questions being posed about the EU\u2019s ability to deal with the immediate health impacts of the crisis, as well as the potentially even more consequential economic effects as countries in Europe\u2019s South are plunged into yet another economic emergency (Erlanger 2020).",

No one in East or Southeast Asia is expecting the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), or any of the other increasing number of overlapping, largely ineffectual regional organizations to oversee a collective response to the crisis (Beeson 2019). On the contrary, populations are looking to national leaders to \u2018do something\u2019, and this is likely throw an unfavourable light on the responses of states such Indonesia and the Philippines in particular, where leaders look out of their depth and state capacities are plainly limited. In some ways, perhaps, the natural environment is revealing not only our continuing vulnerability to crises we find difficult to control, but our responsibility in creating them in the first place.",

The reason that COVID-19 is triggering such alarm, not to mention unprecedented and hitherto unthinkable policy interventions, is because of the immediacy of the threat it poses. By comparison, climate change is the proverbial but all too real \u2018slow burner\u2019. The point to make about both threats, however, is that they are having direct and measurable impacts on us and the foundations of the modern industrialised societies than have underpinned unprecedented standards of living and general development.

In this context, at least, some of the more impoverished parts of East Asia may well be hit harder than even places such as Italy and Spain. It is very unlikely that there will be any regional cooperation to share the economic pain caused by the pandemic either. At least the EU is trying to come to the economic rescue; in East Asia there is no similar regional capacity.

Given that few parts of Southeast Asia are free of the sort of environmental problems that are implicated in both the current pandemic and the region\u2019s long-term bio-security, it is quite possible that China\u2019s long-term influence will grow\u2014despite its apparent role in causing the crisis in the first place.

The divisions between the \u2018frugal four\u2019 (Austria, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands) and the feckless Southerners have been painfully apparent (Kurz 2020); so, too, has the continuing leverage that the likes of Italy can exert simply because it is too big to fail.
