Subsequent analysis of the virus has revealed features that may be used in preventative or therapeutic strategies. Analogous to the 3C proteases encoded by picornaviruses, a virally encoded 3C\u2010like (3CL) protease that functions in the maturation of viral polyproteins is essential for the completion of the SARS\u2010CoV life cycle [5]. It is a chymotrypsin\u2010like protease that uses a Cys rather than a Ser residue as the nucleophile in the active site. The 3CL protease contains an additional helical C\u2010terminal domain of about 100 residues, absent from the analogous picornavirus 3C and chymotrypsin, which is essential for enzymatic activity. Its removal obviates proteolytic activity, since this critical domain is responsible for the dimerization of the protease, which is a prerequisite for proteolytic activity [6]. Moreover, the active site of the SARS\u2010CoV 3CL protease comprises a catalytic dyad rather than a triad.",

Crystallization of the protease [7, 8] has led to the identification of several candidate inhibitors in computer modeling studies [9, 10] and biological assays [11]. However, to date, a detailed exploration of inhibitor activity has been lacking. Previously, we developed a fluorescence\u2010based assay suitable to screen inhibitors of the protease in a high throughput format [12, 13]. We used this system presently to screen a compound library consisting of 960 mostly commercially available drugs and biologically active substances. In light of previous reports, we were interested in examining the influence of metal\u2010conjugated compounds on protease activity [14, 15, 16].

As shown, Western blots revealed that 10 \u03bcM phenylmercuric acetate suppressed detection of the viral spike protein (Fig. 1\n). The actin level in Vero E6 cells treated with phenylmercuric acetate and then infected by SARS\u2010CoV was lower, indicating that at a concentration of 10 \u03bcM the compound might be toxic to the cells. The presence of 1 \u03bcM thimerosal diminished the detectable quantity of the spike protein by over 90 percent (Fig. 1). Similar observations were obtained using 10 \u03bcM hexachlorophene (Fig. 1). The latter two compounds displayed no apparent toxic effect, as evidenced by the unchanged actin levels. This hexachlorophene concentration also showed strong inhibition of cytopathic effect on virus\u2010infected Vero E6 cells (results not shown). No cytotoxicity was exhibited when Vero E6 cells were treated with 10 \u03bcM hexachlorophene (Fig. 2\n).",

Several metal ions inhibit Cys protease via the interaction with a nucleophilic sulfur anion [14]. SARS\u2010CoV 3CL protease is also a Cys protease. Presently, seven transition metal ions were tested. While Hg2+, Zn2+ and Cu2+ were effective, Co2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ni2+ did not inhibit 3CL protease activity. These metal ions are non\u2010competitive inhibitors by virtue of their size. They are too small to block substrate binding, despite being capable of interaction with the active site Cys residue. Phenylmercuric acetate and phenylmercuric nitrate are similar to Hg2+ in their inhibitory power. However, the observed markedly higher affinity of 1\u2010hydroxypyridine\u20102\u2010thione zinc for the protease, compared to Zn2+, is consistent with the suggestion that the former is a more specific 3CL inhibitor. It is noteworthy that Zn\u2010containing compounds such as zinc acetate are added as a supplement to the drug for the treatment of Wilson's disease [21], indicating the safety of the ion for human use. More relevantly, zinc salts such as zincum gluconicum (Zenullose) may be effective in treating the common cold, a disease caused by rhinoviruses, without knowledge of the molecular target [22].

The enzyme activities were measured using 8\u201380 \u03bcM fluorogenic substrate in the absence (\u2218) or presence of 2 (\u25b4) and 5 \u03bcM (\u25a0) inhibitor. The data were fitted with Eq. (1) using KinetAsyst II program to obtain the K\ni value (0.17 \u03bcM). The inhibition pattern indicates that 1\u2010hydroxypyridine\u20102\u2010thione zinc is competitive with respect to the substrate.",

The reaction velocities of SARS 3CL protease in the absence (\u2218) or presence of 3 (\u25b4) and 5 \u03bcM (\u25a0) Zn2+ and various substrate concentrations ranged from 8 to 80 \u03bcM were used to determine the K\ni value (1.1 \u03bcM) of Zn2+ by fitting the data with Eq.
