Invasive pneumococcal diseases (such as meningitis and bacteremia) and pneumonia from Streptococcus pneumoniae are associated with increased mortality among individuals with diabetes [12]. Therefore, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends pneumococcal vaccination in individuals with diabetes [13]. There are currently two types of pneumococcal vaccines - Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV13) and Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine (PPV23). Guidelines for pneumococcal immunization across the world are complex and vary greatly between countries in terms of age groups and risk groups recommended for vaccination, as well as which vaccine should be administered. In Thailand, our current national guidance on adult immunization still reflects the previous version of ACIP recommendation which suggested routine PCV13 for adults ages 65 years and older and followed with PPV23 one year later [14]. For people with diabetes younger than 65 years, only PPV23 is suggested to be administered and repeated every 5 years.",

Based on the available data among patients with T2DM in East Asian countries [16], [17], [18], the annual influenza vaccination rate was only 30-60% and pneumococcal vaccination rate was less than 20%. In an effort to further improve both vaccines coverage rates, it is necessary to understand the current trends and associated factors of vaccination coverage rates. The primary objective of this study is to determine the trends of influenza and pneumococcal vaccine uptakes in individuals with T2DM who attended a routine outpatient diabetes clinic at our hospital.

For pneumococcal vaccination, the rate of vaccination was relatively stable at less than 20% througout the study period. The rate of both influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations varied considerably from 0-44% among our diabetologists. The strongest predictive factors to receive both influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations were the presence of moderate to severe co-morbiditis. Our results implied that T2DM had largely been ignored as an indicator for influenza and pneumococcal vaccines unless the patients have complex comorbidities. These results highlight the need for pro-active vaccination service to younger patients with T2DM.",

However, eligible patients must receive influenza vaccine from the public sector or private providers who participate in the National Health Insurance Plan [21]. Despite having this program in place for over a decade, the uptake of influenza vaccination among Thai people remained suboptimal. For pneumococcal vaccine, the patients must cover the cost of this vaccine themselves. Therefore, the pneumococcal vaccine coverage rate is much lower than in other countries [22], [23]. Beside socio-economic status, attitudes and beliefs of eligible patients toward vaccination play a major role in the decision-making process [24], [25]. Adult vaccination is often undervalued and there is a lack of assertiveness from healthcare professionals when compared with childhood vaccination. Despite more opportunities to get vaccinated in patients with T2DM when visiting routine outpatient clinics, vaccination rates for these populations have been suboptimal all over the world. Vaccination coverage has been set as one of the key measures for successful diabetes program and also a key public health action to prevent the spread of infectious diseases [4]. Physicians and related healthcare professionals should take a role to review immunization histories and to provide vaccinations for their patients. Our present results suggest that active hospital-based vaccination in adult patients with T2DM needs improvement and more effective reminder systems for attending diabetologists should be implemented.",

As the trend of influenza vaccination rate in our cohort continuously increased until the peak rate at almost 60% in 2015 and then the trend dropped the year after. There was a peak period of seasonal flu activity in Thailand during 2015-2016. This phenomenon is explained by the possibility of vaccine hesitancy effect regarding its effectiveness against the pandemic [28]. Another possible explanation is our hospital policy to start collecting influenza vaccination as a key quality improvement program since 2015. Therefore, it could affect the surge of vaccination rate in the first year after implementation. However, these observations underscore the need for sustainable interventions to increase vaccination uptake. Even among European Union countries, none could achieve the target for influenza vaccination of 75% in people living with chronic disease (the median uptake rate was only 50%) [9]. Global efforts to increase seasonal influenza vaccine coverage rate must involve more proactive strategies from healthcare providers around the world to prevent the future influenza pandemic.",

            "text": "During influenza outbreaks, pneumococcal vaccines may help prevent secondary pneumococcal infections [29]. The rate of pneumococcal vaccination uptakes in patients with T2DM are variable and difficult to benchmark when compared with influenza vaccine coverage rate. In contrast to some higher income countries such as South Korea which the coverage rate of PPV dramatically increased after the national policy to give free vaccine in all elderly Koreans aged \u226565 years [17], pneumococcal vaccine has to be paid out-of-pocket in Thailand. Although pediatricians generally recommend PCV in infants, it has not been included in the National Immunization Program and the vaccine coverage is still low in children [30]. PCV13 vaccine has been approved for adults in Thailand in immunocompromized conditions and people with diabetes age \u2265 65 years old since 2011 but lack data to establish cost-effectiveness in general people. As a result, less than 5-10% of Thai people with T2DM received pneumococcal vaccination from a previous study in Thailand [31]. As shown in this study, the coverage rate of our patients with severe comorbidities was almost 10 times greater than patients with mild comorbidities. This data implies that the importance of pneumococcal vaccination among the general T2DM people has been overlooked and continuing efforts to increase pneumococcal vaccination should be emphasized in all people with diabetes, not only people with more complex comorbidities. In light of the ongoing of an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), routine vaccination of available vaccines and rules of sick day managements became increasingly important to keep people with diabetes from preventable illnesses [32]. Because symptoms and signs of seasonal flu and flu-like illness infections could be similar to COVID-19, counseling regarding routine influenza and pneumococcal vaccination should be provided to all patients and the role of telehealth or home vaccination by healthcare personnel might be applied in order to get all unvaccinated patients to receive both vaccines.",

The findings could not be generalized to other patients with T2DM in Thailand. The socio-economic factor influences the decision to receive both vaccines in many patients. In private settings, the patients have to pay the cost of influenza and pneumococcal vaccine for themselves. Therefore, this study may have underestimated the rate of influenza vaccination if patients did not inform the treating physicians that they were already received influenza vaccination from other places. For the pneumococcal vaccination, our vaccine coverage rate may be overestimated from the patients with higher socio-economic status in private settings. Similarly, the health beliefs and knowledge of influenza among various diabetologists in our hospital could affect the overall rate of vaccination in our study. But our study could serve as a reference for future studies on vaccinations among Thai people with diabetes. Second, data on vaccination in some patients were documented by treating physicians as self-report data from their patients. The recall bias from these patients could affect the results. However, an earlier study reported that self-reporting may be the only effective and feasible way to gather data from diverse population [33]. Additionally, this study was conducted based on medical audits over the 9-year period with a uniform format. It would not affect greatly the trend of vaccination coverage rates. Third, some factors such as education level, economic status, previous history of vaccine-preventable hospitalizations could not be retrieved from our medical records which might affect the associated factors in receiving both vaccines [34]. Finally, the sample size of audited medical records was not planed as this study was a part of quality improvement program since 2010. The stratification by characteristics that may impact the results improves the sample quality but a convenience sample may not reliably infer to a population.",
