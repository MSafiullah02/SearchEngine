These additional \"moonlighting\" functions have the potential to obfuscate data interpretation and have implications for therapeutic design. Moonlighting enzymes comprise a subcategory of multifunctional proteins that possess at least two distinct biological functions on a single polypeptide chain. Presently, identifying moonlighting proteins relies heavily on serendipitous empirical data with clues arising from proteins lacking signal peptides that are localised to the cell surface. Here, we describe examples of microbial proteases with additional non-proteolytic functions, including streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B, PepO and C5a peptidases, mycoplasmal aminopeptidases, mycobacterial chaperones and viral papainlike proteases. We explore how these non-proteolytic functions contribute to host cell adhesion, modulate the coagulation pathway, assist in non-covalent folding of proteins, participate in cell signalling, and increase substrate repertoire.

These molecules are targeted by microbial adhesins to aid colonisation and invasion. There is also increasing evidence suggesting that microbial binding of ECM molecules elicits more than just adhesion. For example, fibronectin not only provides a bridge between the intracellular cytoskeleton and other ECM components, but is also involved in inflammation by augmenting chemotaxis and leucocyte function, cell signalling [32] and cell invasion [33] . Fibronectinbinding proteins are known virulence factors in important human pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus and group A Streptococcus [32] , and Campylobacter jejuni fibronectinbinding proteins have been implicated in membrane ruffling stimulation and consequent host cell invasion by activating the epidermal growth factor pathway [34] .

Plasmin is a proinflammatory agonist that dissolves fibrin clots, activates collagenase and gelatinase precursors, and degrades laminin [42] . Whilst laminin is not degraded by Pla, the protease binds strongly to this BM protein [43] . Thus, Pla-mediated laminin adhesion and plasminogen activation work together to produce localised proteolysis at the mammalian BM, facilitating Y. pestis invasion.

Fibronectin was not degraded by DPPIV and its binding was evident even in proteolytic inactive DPPIV mutants. Furthermore, binding fibronectin inhibited fibroblast recruitment and it was suggested that this could affect recovery from damage caused by inflammation [55] .

Following contact activation by antigenic stimuli, a series of events occurs that ultimately results in the deposition of a fibrin mesh that captures invading pathogens and exposes them to bactericidal peptides released from platelets and kinins [60, 61] . Once the infection has been cleared by leukocytes, the proenzyme plasminogen is cleaved by two serine proteases, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase plasminogen activator, to release serine protease plasmin, which degrades the fibrin clot [62] . Despite this formidable defence system, numerous bacteria have developed strategies to avoid fibrin clot confinement and subsequent immune clearance. One common mechanism involves the expression of surface proteins that bind plasminogen. These recruit host plasminogen to the cell surface and utilise host tPA and urokinase plasminogen activator to induce localised plasmin activity, thus facilitating fibrinolysis [60, 63] . Interestingly, some of the most extensively characterised plasminogen-binding proteins have been cytosolic or glycolytic pathway proteins localised to the cell surface by a yet unknown secretion mechanism [63] . Several extracellular and intracellular proteases have been shown to bind plasminogen, including endopeptidase O (PepO) from Streptococcus pneumoniae, two aminopeptidases from M. hyopneumoniae and DPPIV from Pseudomonas aeruginosa [64] [65] [66] . PepO from S. pneumoniae [65] and glutamyl aminopeptidase [66] and leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) [67] from M. hyopneumoniae were shown to bind plasminogen in a dose-dependent manner and that bound plasminogen was readily converted to plasmin in the presence of tPA.

Through ATP hydrolysis AAA + proteins are able to generate a mechanical force that enables the remodelling of bound substrates [70] . In bacteria, AAA + -mediated protein degradation is usually performed by an AAA + protein (such as ClpA or ClpX) that binds and unfolds a target substrate and then delivers it to a protease such as ClpP for proteolysis. There are currently five known AAA + -containing degradation pathways, comprising ClpXP, ClpAP, HsIUV, FtsH and Lon. For most systems, the AAA + domain and protease are encoded on separate polypeptides; however, both are present within a single polypeptide in FtsH and Lon [71] . Lon also possesses a non-catalytic DNA-binding domain [72] .

Nevertheless, Lon plays multiple important roles in cells. Firstly, Lon degrades aged, misfolded or aggregated proteins [73] . In the genome-reduced mycoplasmas, Lon mimics the function of the ClpXP proteolysis system.
