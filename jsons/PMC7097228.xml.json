In humans, it is caused by five Plasmodium species: P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae and P. knowlesi, each of which causes a wide range of clinical symptoms and distinct complications (Table 1). The disease symptoms mainly occur during the blood-stage infection when erythrocytes, the only host cell that parasites can invade and multiply within (with the exception of the pre-erythrocytic hepatocyte stage), are infected. P. falciparum malaria accounts for 80% of malaria cases in sub-Saharan Africa and is considered the deadliest of all malarial species, causing cerebral malaria, respiratory distress and severe anaemia. By contrast, P. vivax malaria accounts for >50% of malaria cases outside of Africa and generally occurs with milder symptoms, but complications such as severe anaemia are not uncommon6,7. Detailed genetic analysis of Plasmodium spp. has also led to the recognition that P. knowlesi, which causes malaria in monkeys, can also be transmitted to humans and might be life threatening, with symptoms such as acute lung and kidney failure8,9.",

For example, the sequestration of parasitized erythrocytes (hereafter referred to as infected red blood cells (iRBCs)) in blood vessels within host tissues is well correlated with disease severity, but the parasite and/or host-mediated factors that contribute to iRBC sequestration have not been fully determined, although P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) and receptors expressed on activated host endothelial cells are known to contribute10. Such factors may affect not only cerebral malaria, in which P. falciparum parasites are known to be sequestrated in the brain vessels and retina of humans11, but also the pathology in other organs that are characterized by high levels of iRBC sequestration, including the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, kidneys and skin11,12,13.

In other words, why and how does Plasmodium infection exploit host immunity, allowing reinfection of the same individual again and again? The expansion of atypical memory B cell populations and an exhaustion of CD4+ T cell responses have been reported in malaria-endemic regions17,18,19. Hence, growing evidence suggests that the chronic illness caused by incomplete immunity to malaria causes long-term hidden pathologies20. One such pathology is Burkitt lymphoma, a cancer that develops in both childhood and adulthood in Africa and that is closely related to P. falciparum and Epstein\u2013Barr virus co-endemicicity21. The robust and long-lasting expansion of germinal centre B cell populations that occurs during Plasmodium infection may induce increased activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) expression, eventually leading to chromosomal translocations22,23,24 that predispose to the development of lymphoma in immune tissues.",

Acute systemic immune activation, such as pro-inflammatory cytokine production, lymphocyte activation and vessel congestion, is evident; however, how these pathological events affect each tissue or organ is not understood well. Current interventions for malaria are based on the administration of antimalarial drugs aimed at killing parasites and on supportive care to reduce systemic symptoms, such as coma, high fever, severe anaemia and acidosis. In this Review, we emphasize the need to focus on host interactions with Plasmodium parasites at various tissue levels and the importance of targeting local and specific organ failure and/or pathologies during, as well as long after, infection. These pathologies might be critical for determining diagnostic as well as therapeutic targets for the development of novel adjunct therapies to be used in combination with current antimalarials. We describe new evidence and new ways of targeting infected tissues of a few, but not all, unique organs such as the brain, gut and bones. We initially summarize how the blood tissue plays a central role in the initial pathogenesis caused by Plasmodium parasites, following which we explore the interaction of infected blood tissue with specific organs composed of multiple, unique interacting tissue layers. Largely owing to limitations of space, topics regarding the sporozoite stages of infection in the liver and those on the innate immune recognition of Plasmodium parasites28,29 are out of the scope of this Review. In fact, Plasmodium parasites do possess several ligands used to manipulate host cell invasion that could potentially be exploited as host factor targets for anti-malaria therapy30,31, a notion close to the topic of this Review, but we exclude and leave this to an excellent recent article focusing on this topic32.",

Moreover, there is a close correlation between malaria infection and increased rates of infection with other gut pathogens (for example, non-typhoidal Salmonella and helminths), possibly owing to an impairment of intestinal barrier function during malaria119,120,121. Several factors may have a role in this, such as increased histamine release from mast cells in the gut122 or the modulation of intestinal inflammation and immune responses via an increase in the number of exhausted neutrophils45 or an increase in the levels of IL-10 family cytokines, including IL-10 and IL-22, in the intestinal tissues during malaria infection, as these factors may ameliorate responses to secondary bacterial infections123,124,125. However, it should be kept in mind that the composition of the gut microbiota has a clear impact on the severity of malaria disease126,127,128, suggesting that there is a bidirectional relation between the gut and Plasmodium parasites that is not well understood and requires further investigation.",

The blood capillaries carrying iRBCs reach the lamina propria of the intestinal mucosa and possibly come into close proximity with lacteals, which are specialized lymphatic vessels of intestinal villi that play a key role in nutrient absorption and in gut immune responses, such as the transport of microbial antigens and APCs to the mesenteric lymph nodes, where antigen presentation by APCs promotes the induction of T cells with gut-homing properties129. There is a gut\u2013vascular barrier comprising endothelial cells, enteric pericytes and enteric glial cells that is very similar to the barriers found in other parts of the body (such as the BBB) and that actively blocks bacterial dissemination from the gut epithelium to the blood130. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that intestinal bleeding may occur as a result of malaria-mediated immune responses that directly affect lacteals. It is possible that lacteals with disturbed remodelling have impaired survival and villi length118, and this may have knock-on effects on immune cell composition and on the microbiota of the gut tissue.",

            "text": "Bone tissue is a mineralized connective tissue supporting the whole body and it houses the bone marrow, which comprises specialized niches that maintain and regulate haematopoiesis, erythropoiesis and bone remodelling (Fig. 4b). Arteries in the bone marrow unite and become specialized vessels called bone marrow sinusoids, which allow cells to pass between the circulation and bone marrow131. Without any cytoadherence, Plasmodium parasites can invade and multiply in nucleated erythroblasts located in extravascular spaces of the bone marrow132,133,134. The parasites can survive and hide in these erythroid precursors and develop into gametocyte stages135,136,137, likely assisting in the continuous success of malaria transmission to mosquitoes. However, it is still not known why Plasmodium parasites preferentially differentiate into gametocytes in the bone marrow and whether a specific bone marrow niche is required to support the development of gametocytes. Unlike haematopoietic niches, which are located adjacent to sinusoids, erythroid niches are found throughout the bone marrow and are generally located away from the sinusoids, although they move closer to the sinusoids as they mature138. This may suggest a major role for the erythroid niche in Plasmodium gametocyte development. From an immunological point of view, it has recently been shown that CD8+ T cells produce IFN\u03b3 in response to infected MHC class I-expressing erythroblasts residing in the bone marrow; by contrast, mature erythrocytes residing in the blood circulation lack any MHC molecules and cannot present antigens to CD8+ T cells132,139. Activated CD8+ T cells promote the exposure of phosphatidylserine on infected erythroblasts, and this enhances the susceptibility of the infected cells to phagocytosis by macrophages132, suggesting a protective role of CD8+ T cells against malaria. However, whether bone marrow erythroid cells contribute to the expansion of pathological populations of CD8+ T cells that can drive cerebral malaria has not been investigated.",

            "text": "Despite the growing body of information on how bone marrow niches are manipulated by Plasmodium parasites, very little is known about the potential outcomes of interactions between Plasmodium parasites and bone tissue. In bone marrow, haematopoietic stem cells give rise to blood cells and bone-resident osteoclasts, whereas mesenchymal stem cells give rise to osteoblasts, adipocytes and stromal cells. A very recent study has suggested that during Plasmodium infection, parasites and their products \u2014 mainly haemozoin \u2014 continuously accumulate in bone marrow and cause acute as well as chronic bone loss27. Although it is not precisely known how Plasmodium products are retained long term in the bone marrow, it is possible that engulfment by macrophages or other phagocytic cells, such as bone-resident osteoclasts, or trapping by extracellular matrix in the bone marrow contributes to this phenomenon27. Chronic bone loss during malaria infection is mediated by over-activation of osteoclast resorption activity. The osteoclasts are activated by the key osteoclastogenic cytokine RANKL (also known as TNFSF11), which is upregulated in osteoblasts through MYD88-dependent signalling triggered by the persistence of parasite products in the bone marrow27. These findings highlight how, not only during acute malaria infection but also after recovery from infection, Plasmodium products continue to interact with tissue-resident cells, including bone cells, osteoclasts and osteoblasts, and how they can cause long-term effects in the host, such as bone loss and growth problems. The molecular and immunological pathways underlying the interaction between Plasmodium spp. and the niches of various bone marrow cells and the effect of these interactions on the immune system140,141 need to be addressed in the future.",

Here, we have attempted to summarize the recent progress of research focusing on the tissue environment in a few example organs, such as the brain, gut and bone, where Plasmodium parasites reach the tissue via the blood. However, the lungs142, kidneys143 and placenta144 represent other organs that are seriously affected during malaria infection, and these tissues should also be examined more closely in future studies. Here, our aim has been to show that the influence of malarial parasites reaches beyond erythrocytes and may vary depending on, and be tightly regulated by, the vessel-specific and/or tissue-specific microenvironment. On the basis of the available data, we suggest that the brain pathology caused by Plasmodium parasites is not homogeneously controlled by parasite sequestration but is rather controlled by the local, specific and unique anatomical structure of vessels, parenchyma and lymphatics, which closely interact with each other during both homeostasis and infection. This concept is in accordance with the recent understanding that the vascular and epithelial barriers do cooperate in an organ-specific manner in homeostatic and diseased conditions130. We additionally emphasize that parasite-derived products can continue to stay in the body, interact with tissues and cause chronic pathologies even long after recovery from infection, particularly in the case of bone tissue. The gut pathology caused by malaria, which has recently been recognized, was summarized, and the possible anatomical interaction between blood tissues and special gut lymphatics has been introduced.",

In blood tissue, infected red blood cells (iRBCs) and their products may interact with other infected and uninfected RBCs (causing rosetting), or they may interact with immune cell populations (causing a cytokine storm) or with the endothelial cells of blood vessels (causing RBC sequestration and microhaemorrhage).
