            "text": "The potential for cancer induction has been a major cause of concern. However, until recently, there were only a few studies involving frequencies in the spectral bands used for wireless communication. These reports showed an accelerated development of spontaneous mammary tumors in mice or promotion of tumor growth in animals, if the tumor was first initiated by other means, following exposure to 800\u20132,500 MHz radiations (Szmigielski et al., 1982; Szudinski et al., 1982; Wu et al., 1994). Some of these studies used relatively high average SARs (6\u201312 W/kg) that can induce appreciable temperature increases in the animal body. Since chemical action is facilitated by thermal energy, RF-induced heating could have influenced the action of such chemical agents as benzopyrene or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). However, the potential for thermal enhancement apparently did not have any influence on the action of dimethylhydrazine (DMH).",

(The Kunz et al. report contains full details of the study on which the Chou et al. (1992) paper was based.) Beginning at 8 weeks of age, Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were irradiated by pulsed microwaves (10-\u03bcs rectangular pulses modulated at 8 Hz and pulsed at 800 pps, 0.15\u20130.4 W/kg SAR) for 25 months. A statistically significant increase was observed in primary malignancies at death in irradiated rats (18) vs. sham-irradiated controls (5). However, lifelong exposure did not reveal any significant effects on the general health of exposed rats. Furthermore, the survival curves were virtually identical for microwave and sham-exposed rats, and there was no difference during any phase of the rats\u2019 lifetime.",

            "text": "One of the first studies using frequencies and modulations specific to mobile phones involved the use of implanted rat brain tumors (Salford et al., 1993). Like most scientific inquiries, this study began as a rational discovery of any potential causality between exposure to mobile phone radiation and brain tumor promotion. This study was followed by the use of an experimental animal model, E\u03bc-Pim1 transgenic mice, in a first-of-a-kind experiment to systematically investigate a dose\u2013response relationship for any risk of cancer associated with cell phone RF exposure (Repacholi et al., 1997). The E\u03bc-Pim1 transgenic mice carry a lymphoma oncogene and are predisposed to developing lymphomas spontaneously. Although there are physiological differences, test results in rodent studies have often shown that the same organs are affected in humans and in rodents by known carcinogens (NTP, 1999). Since then, to help evaluate the possible health risk of cellular mobile telecommunication devices and systems, a substantial number of investigations have been conducted using mice and rats under controlled or good-laboratory-practice (GLP) conditions. These experiments generally adhere to prescribed protocols, akin to product or drug testing. A summary and analysis of recent results is presented in what follows.",

Follicular lymphomas were the major contributor to the increased tumor incidence. At the end of the experiment, 53% of the exposed mice had lymphomas, compared with 22% of the unexposed controls. The exposed transgenic mice also recorded a faster onset of lymphomas. In this study, 100 mice were sham-exposed and 101 were exposed for up to 18 months. The pulse width was 0.6 ms. The average incident power density and SAR were 2.6\u201313 W/m2 and 0.13\u20131.4 W/kg, respectively.",

            "text": "It should be noted that the E\u03bc-Pim1 transgenic mice were genetically engineered for a predisposition to lymphoma. Thus, the extrapolation of results found in a very sensitive animal model to possible carcinogenesis in humans is not well established. Moreover, this study suffered from two general types of identifiable deficiencies. One type was dosimetric in nature; specifically, the plane-wave-equivalent exposure system used in this study allowed mice to roam and huddle freely during exposure to incident power densities of 2.6\u201313 W/m2. Consequently, there was a wide variation of SARs (0.008\u20134.2 W/kg, averaging 0.13\u20131.4 W/kg). Only an average response could be inferred from an average SAR, not an individual SAR. Moreover, it is conceivable that the higher incidence of lymphomas was associated with the higher SAR instead of the reported average SAR. Further, mice selected for necropsy during the experiment were not replaced with either other mice or tissue-equivalent phantoms, thus altering dosimetry in the remaining animals. There are also some critical shortcomings concerning the biological assay, methods, and procedures. The study lacked any standardized assessment criteria for deciding which mice would be selected for necropsy and surviving mice were disposed of without performing necropsy to ascertain whether there was infection and/or other relevant diseases, such as kidney failure, in those animals. Apparently, cage-control animals were not included as part of the experiment.",

For example, the variation in SAR was reduced by restraining the mice and by using tissue-equivalent phantoms to replace autopsied mice. The new exposure system, supplied by Motorola, consisted of 15 lossy, radial, parallel-plate electromagnetic cavities (Ferris Wheel), configured for far-field operation. Each cavity had 40 mice restrained individually in clear Perplex tubes, cylindrically arranged around a dipole antenna. The tubes were constructed to prevent each mouse from changing its orientation relative to the field to facilitate SAR determination. The exposed groups were divided into four SAR levels: 0.25, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 W/kg. A standardized set of criteria (10% reduction in body mass over a week) was used for selecting mice for necropsy, and all surviving animals were necropsied. A total of 120 lymphoma-prone E\u03bc-Pim1 mice and 120 wild-type mice were exposed for 1 h/day, 5 days/week, at each of the four SAR levels, for up to 24 months. In addition, 120 E\u03bc-Pim1 and 120 wild-type mice were sham-exposed; there was also an unrestrained negative (cage) control group.",

A replication, as a standard practice of the scientific approach, requires that the same methods and materials are followed as in the earlier study. Given that there are major differences in materials and methods (beyond refinements), the design of the latter is more appropriately characterized as an attempt to confirm or refute, rather than replicate. More significantly, close examination of the source of mice, exposure regime, animal restraint, and the omission of data from analysis in the later study could lead to a different conclusion than that stated in the publication. It was stated in the paper that the mice were supplied from the same source used in the earlier study, and listed Taconic Farms, New York, as the source. However, mice for the earlier study came from GenPharm International of Mountainview, California. Thus, the E\u03bc-Pim1 mice appear not to be the same after all. Even the same strain of mice, from different suppliers, may have different characteristics and may respond differently, a factor to be considered further.",

The biological effect of fragmenting exposure duration is not well known. However, diurnal variations and the temporal dependence of physiologic, cellular and molecular processes are well established. The use of free-roaming vs. restrained animals by themselves is not a problem so long as the effects on these mice are characterized, with appropriate cage controls. Unfortunately, data for the cage-control mice were missing from the publication (Utteridge et al., 2002). Restraining the animal in a tight tube during the exposure session constitutes a continuing stress to the animal, which may lead to significant stress responses that potentially could obscure any effect from the exposure to cell phone radiation.",

            "text": "There are also some rather glaring inconsistencies in the published data (see Lin, 2002). For example, some or all of the mice were dead after 18 or 20 months, according to one figure (Fig. 1), but they still had weight gains up to 26 months, according to another figure (Fig. 2) [Figs. 1 and 2 in Utteridge et al., 2002]. The study design included equal numbers of freely moving mice for negative controls (cage controls). However, data for the cage-control group were not given in the paper and appear to have been excluded from the statistical analyses. By not having the free-moving mice form a part of the statistical analysis group, the report was deprived of the pathophysiology of cage-control mice for comparison. The cage controls can and should serve as valuable background materials, which potentially might be masked by stress response induced by the restraining tube used for sham control. It is noteworthy that the incidence of lymphomas among the sham controls (SAR = 0; mice are restrained but not exposed) was very high in this study. Specifically, among the transgenic mice, the incidence of lymphomas was 75% for the sham-control group (89 out of 120 mice developed lymphomas: 15 with lymphoblastic lymphomas, 74 with nonlymphoblastic lymphomas). In contrast, the incidence of lymphomas in the earlier study (Repacholi et al., 1997) was 22% for the sham-control mice (22 out of 100 mice developed the disease: 3 with lymphoblastic lymphomas, 19 with nonlymphoblastic lymphomas). The high degree of incidence in the sham controls (75 vs. 22%) makes the experimental protocol impractical. It could have masked an effect from cell phones, or any other agent for that matter. It is unfeasible to come to any firm conclusions about lymphomas in transgenic mice exposed to cell phone radiation. These flaws \u2013 possibly in the sourcing or handling of mice, the statistical analysis of the data, or in the fundamental design of the experiment \u2013 limit the conclusions that can be drawn for the outcome of the Utteridge et al. study, despite the paper\u2019s claim.\n\n",

(2002) for exposure of the E\u03bc-Pim1 transgenic mice to pulsed radiofrequency energy at 898.4 MHz was reported by Faraone et al. (2006). Twin-well calorimetry was used to measure the whole-body SAR of exposed mice. One major conclusion was that since the average lifetime weight was slightly higher than originally projected (30 g), the lifetime exposure received by the mice was somewhat less than anticipated. In particular, the mean lifetime exposure levels were lower by about 18% than the original targets for the wild-type mice and about 10% for the transgenic mice. Specifically, the lifetime average whole-body SARs were 0.21, 0.86, 1.7, and 3.4 W/kg for the four exposure groups. Infrared thermography showed SAR peaks in the abdomen, neck and head in thermograms taken over the sagittal plane of mouse cadavers. The peak local SAR (1-g) at these locations, determined by thermometric measurements, showed peak-to-average SAR ratios with typical values around 3:1, but some are close to 6:1. Thus, the average and peak SARs were slightly lower than originally reported in Utteridge et al. (2002).",

It was intended as a follow-up to the study by Repacholi et al. (1997) with improvements in dosimetry and methodology. The exposure system consisted of four Ferris Wheels and each wheel was composed of two parallel, circular, stainless-steel metal plates with a conical antenna in its center. Dosimetry was improved by restraining the mice in plastic tubes to obtain more uniform exposure. The incident field was adjusted as a function of body mass to obtain an age-independent exposure dose. Tissue-equivalent phantoms were used to replace necropsied mice to maintain a more consistent and symmetrical absorption profile. The study used identical RF signals as the previous study, i.e., animals were exposed to 217 Hz pulsed 900 MHz fields, but at average whole-body SARs of 0.5, 1.4, or 4.0 W/kg. In addition to whole body, dosimetric information about organ and spatial-average-peak SARs as well as their lifetime variations were reported. It is interesting to note that the ratio of organ or tissue average SAR to whole-body average SAR varied between 0.18 and 1.90. Moreover, the spatial peak SAR relative to the whole-body average SAR was as high as 62 and 85 for tissue mass of 5 and 0.5 mg, respectively.",

First, the exposure systems and protocols were different. Mice were free-roaming, not restrained, in a plane-wave exposure field for the initial study, but the Utteridge et al. and Oberto et al. studies used restrained animals in plastic tubes placed in radial waveguides for exposure. The resulting whole-body average SAR not only differed among the three studies but also varied between the two studies using restrained animals. Although the medium range of whole-body average SARs attained in the two subsequent studies was in the range of the average SARs reported in the earlier study, the tissue-specific exposure levels and peak-to-average SARs differed to a much larger degree (close to 100 times). Moreover, they varied even between the two studies using restrained animals in Ferris Wheel exposure systems.",

Clearly, the incidence of lymphomas among the sham controls varied widely.

Although randomization of group assignment and daily placement of mice into the exposure chamber helped to ensure comparable long-term average exposure, they do not mitigate against the selective absorption that occurred during each exposure session. The selective absorption could have a confounding influence especially given the growth and maturation these mice experienced during the course of the study. Further, the dosimetric determinations are estimations of time and spatial average absorptions and they bear little relation to daily exposure or individual SAR or their distribution inside the animal body. It should be noted that the histology slides were evaluated in the blind except for the cage controls.

The maximum power radiated from a handset is governed by different classes. The most common is class IV with a maximum radiated mean power of 125 mW. (This is a factor of 2 less than the maximum mean power for GSM). In practice, the power radiated may be much less if the distance to the base station is short. For a small urban cell, the mean value could be as low as \u22126 dBm (6 dB below 1.0 mW, i.e., 0.25 mW).

In particular, the study used pulse-modulated 915 MHz RF fields and two rat glioma models of central nervous system tumors (RG2 and N32). It should be noted that gliomas, including astrocytomas and glioblastomas, are the most common malignancy of the central nervous system in adult humans, and the prognosis is extremely poor. The growth rate of N32, a glioma cell line, is approximately one-half that of RG2 tumor type. (The RG2 tumor model is an ethylnitrosourea-induced cell line, which grows in cell culture in vitro, and provides a reproducible glioma model when inoculated into the brain.) In both cases, tumor cells were injected stereotaxically into the right caudate nucleus of male and female rats (37 experimental and 37 matched-sham-control Fisher 344 rats, 150\u2013250 g). Starting on the fifth day after inoculation, intact (unanesthetized) animals were either RF- or sham-irradiated in individual TEM exposure chambers for 7 h/day, 5 days/week for 2\u20133 weeks. The modulation characteristics were 0.57 ms wide, 1 W pulses repeated at 0, 4, 8.33, 16, 50, or 217 Hz. The reported SARs were 0.008\u20130.4 W/kg. At 50 Hz modulation, the pulse width was 6.67 ms and peak power was 2 W, which produced SARs of 1.0 W/kg. Results from histopathological examinations indicate that repeated exposure to mobile phone RF fields did not promote growth of either the faster or the slower growing implanted gliomas beyond their normal course. Note that these animals typically die of glioma 2\u20133 weeks after glioma cell implantation.",

Exposure began 2 weeks later and lasted for 6 weeks. The exposure to the near-field 929.2 MHz TDMA signal for PDC (PDC, Japanese cellular telephone standard) was directed to the lateral mid-section of the rat body through a quarter-wavelength monopole antenna. The maximum local SARs (temporal average) were 6.6\u20137.2 W/kg for the whole body and 1.7\u20132.0 W/kg within the liver, the target organ. Temporal peak SARs were three times higher due to the duty ratio of the PDC signal. (Although less relevant, the whole-body average SARs were 0.58\u20130.80 W/kg.) The animals were exposed for 90 min a day, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks. At week 3, all rats were subjected to a 2/3 partial hepatectomy. At the end of the 6-week exposure period when these young animals were 14 weeks of age, the experiment was terminated and all animals were killed. Carcinogenic potential was scored by comparing the numbers and areas of the induced glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P) positive foci in the livers of the exposed and sham-exposed rats. Another group of 24 rats, given only DEN and partial hepatectomy, served as the controls. The numbers (no./cm2) of GST-P positive foci were 4.61 \u00b1 1.77, 5.21 \u00b1 1.92 (P < 0.05, vs. control), and 4.09 \u00b1 1.47 and the areas (mm2/cm2) were 0.30 \u00b1 0.16, 0.36 \u00b1 0.21, and 0.28 \u00b1 0.15, for the exposed, sham-exposed and control groups, respectively.

There was no evidence of tumorigenic effects in the CNS from the field exposure; however, some evidence of tumor-inhibiting (\u201cprotective\u201d) effects of TDMA field was observed. Overall, the TDMA field-exposed animals exhibited trends toward a reduced incidence of spontaneous CNS tumors (P < 0.16) and ENU-induced CNS tumors (P < 0.16). In the 54 rats (23%) that died during the study (\u201cpreterm rats\u201d) where primary CNS tumors were determined to be the cause of death, the TDMA-field exposure significantly reduced the incidence of ENU-induced tumors (P < 0.03).",

For example, the brain-averaged exposure differed by a factor of 5 (i.e., 1.5 W/kg at GSM compared with 7.6 W/kg at DCS), whereas the SARs of other organs such as liver, kidneys, etc. were similar. It should be mentioned that this study employed an exposure protocol with a targeted whole-body SAR averaged over the entire exposure period.

The 860 MHz RF exposure at a SAR of 1.0 W/kg averaged over the brain took place for 6 h/day, 5 days/week from 2 up to 24 months of age. The rats were assigned to 15 groups. Each group consisted of 60 rats (30 males and 30 females). Every group exposed to an RF field had a matching sham-exposed group held in identical exposure units for the same periods. These offspring were injected i.v. with 0, 2.5, or 10 mg/kg of ENU to induce brain tumors. Three groups of cage controls were killed at the same time as the rats given corresponding ENU doses. All rats but 2, totaling 898, were necropsied, and major tissues were histopathologically examined. Table 10 gives the number of malignant brain and nerve tumors and the number of animals with tumors. Overall, there was no statistically significant indication that the pulsed (PRF) or FM (CWRF) exposure induced cancer in the Sprague\u2013Dawley rats. Additionally, there was no significant indication of promotion of CNS or spinal cord tumors. The PRF or CWRF had no statistically significant effect on the number, volume, location, multiplicity, histological type, malignancy, or fatality of brain tumors. However, authors suggest there was a trend for the group that received a high dose of ENU and was exposed to the PRF to develop fatal brain tumors at a higher rate than its sham group. Indeed, the result showed a 50% reduction in numbers for sham or CWRF compared with cage controls in the low or zero ENU-dose groups. In contrast, for PRF, the numbers either doubled or were the same compared with cage controls in the low or zero ENU-dose groups.\n",

In each experiment, 120 rats (60 for sham) were injected with a single 50 mg/kg dose of DMBA and continuously exposed to 900 MHz GSM fields in two separate plane wave chambers, except for brief servicing and house-keeping periods, until practically all animals had developed mammary tumors. The animals had freedom to move within their cages. Circularly-polarized RF fields in the exposure chambers had an average power density of 100 \u03bcW/cm2 at the bottom of the animal cages. For an adult female Sprague\u2013Dawley rat weighing 300 g, the whole-body SAR was 0.017\u20130.070 W/kg. Note that the whole-body SAR declined continuously during the course of the experiment due to body-resonant energy absorption. At the beginning of the experiment (51-day old, 150 g), animals had whole-body SARs between 0.033 and 0.13 W/kg. The overall results of the three studies are that low-level GSM-900 RF field exposure did not have any significant effect on tumor latency and that the cumulative DMBA-initiated mammary tumor incidence at the end of the experiment was unaffected by the exposure. However, in the first experiment, the median latency for the development of malignant tumors was statistically significantly extended for RF field-exposed rats compared to sham controls (278 days compared with 145 days). This difference was not detected in the two subsequent experiments. Cage controls were not included in this study. The results show that low-level GSM-900 RF radiation did not appear to have a cancer-promoting effect on DMBA-induced mammary tumors.",

Mammary tumors were induced by ingestion of a single 10 mg dose of DMBA in 55-day-old female Sprague\u2013Dawley rats. RF exposure started 10 days later for 2 h/day, 5 days/week for 9 weeks. Rats (128) were exposed to plane waves with the electric field parallel to the long axis of the body at whole-body SARs of 0.0 (sham), 0.1, 0.7, 1.4, 2.2, and 3.5 W/kg in 8 groups of 16 animals. Among these were two groups at 0.4 W/kg, separated by one month in time. Another 8 rats served as an untreated cage-control group, but were not included in the data analysis. Rats were killed 3 weeks after the end of exposure. The results obtained indicated that there were no differences in latency, multiplicity, or tumor volume among the groups. With regard to tumor incidence (Table 11), while these data showed both increases and decreases compared with sham exposure, overall the results are rather inconsistent. Nevertheless, there seems to be a trend toward reduced rate of incidence of DMBA-initiated mammary tumor for rats exposed to GSM-900 RF fields at 1.4 W/kg or lower. Note that the number of animals per group (16) is relatively small in this study. A smaller number of cage controls (8) were mentioned but data were not presented in this study.\n",

The \u201cexposure wheel\u201d consisted of a circular array of 17 sectored waveguides, excited by a single loop antenna located in the center. To enhance homogeneity of field exposure, each week the exposure position of each rat was rotated one position to the right on the wheel so that the position and exposure of individual rats varied throughout the 26-week exposure duration. Individual rats were administered a single 35 mg/kg dose of DMBA and a total of 500 rats were divided into five groups: cage control and four exposure groups, including sham and three RF exposure groups for SARs of 0.0, 0.44, 1.33, and 4.0 W/kg, respectively. The 26-week exposure started one day after DMBA administration for 4 h/day, 5 days/week. Rats were palpated weekly for the presence of mammary tumors and were killed at the end of the 26-week exposure period. The results showed no significant differences in body mass between sham- and GSM 900-exposed groups. No significant differences in overall mammary tumor incidence, latency to tumor onset, tumor multiplicity, or tumor size were observed between GSM 900- and sham-exposed groups. There were significant differences in body mass and benign mammary tumors between the cage control and experimental groups (sham and exposure). Specifically, body mass and mammary tumor incidence, especially benign tumors in the cage-control group are significantly higher than in the sham- and GSM 900-exposed groups. The latency to mammary tumor onset was also significantly shorter in the cage-control group than in the other groups.",

This study used the same protocol and \u201cwaveguides in a wheel\u201d exposure system as the Yu et al. study. Rats in the cage-control group had in most aspects the highest incidence and malignancy of tumors or neoplasms among all groups. In particular, when compared with the sham-exposed group the cage-control group had significantly more palpable tissue masses, more benign and malignant tumors, perhaps for the same reasons as mentioned previously in connection with the Yu et al. study. In addition, the results showed several significant differences among the various exposure groups: all GSM-exposed groups had, at different times, significantly more palpable tissue masses. There were fewer rats with benign tumors, but more with malignant tumors or neoplasms in the 4.0 W/kg group (Table 12, where SARs of 0.4, 1.33 or 4.0 W/kg are designated as low, mid, or high dose). In addition, there were more adenocarcinomas in the 0.4 W/kg group, more malignant tumors in the 0.4 and 4.0 W/kg groups, more Sprague\u2013Dawley rats with adenocarcinomas in the 4.0 W/kg group, and fewer rats with fibroadenomas in the 0.4 and 4.0 W/kg groups. None of the above findings in GSM-exposed rats produced a clear dose\u2013response relationship. The significant differences between the sham-exposed animals and one or more GSM-exposed groups may be interpreted as evidence of an effect of GSM exposure. However, authors of the paper had opined that the differences between the groups are incidental because of the high variability in results.\n",

Likewise, the two spontaneous tumor induction studies did not show any significant difference in CNS tumor growth or incidence between RF- and sham-exposed rats. As part of their ENU study, Adey et al. (2000) had included a non-ENU group, which yielded a reduction in tumor incidence for TDMA-modulated 836 MHz exposures. The interpretation of this finding becomes obscure since cage-control animals did not form a part of this investigation.

The Bartsch et al. investigation was a self-replicated study using unrestrained rats and it found no difference between sham and plane-wave RF-exposed animals. Restraining the rats as in the Anane et al. study and somewhat higher SARs did not produce any statistical difference either.
