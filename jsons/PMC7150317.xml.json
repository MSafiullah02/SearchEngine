            "text": "On a Friday afternoon before the Labor Day holiday weekend in 1999, the phone at the New York City Department of Health was answered by the on-call epidemiologist. An infectious disease specialist was calling to report an unusually large number of encephalitis or meningitis cases (inflammation of the brain or covering of the brain and spinal cord) at several hospitals in the borough of Queens. Blood and spinal fluid were tested at the New York State and CDC laboratories and reported positive for Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), a virus known to occur in the United States but never in New York City. New York City officials immediately began mosquito control programs in an attempt to stop transmission from mosquitoes, the vector for SLEV. Over the next week, test results appeared to be conflicting. Unknown to many of the investigators of the human outbreak, a veterinarian at the Bronx Zoo was investigating an outbreak of central nervous system disease in birds. Wildlife veterinarians were also observing large bird die-offs but could not find a clear cause. By mid-September, both sets of investigators believed the causative agent was not SLEV. By September 27, after expanding testing services to several federal and academic laboratories as well as to the wider family of Flaviviridae, it was confirmed that the causative agent for the human outbreak, the avian outbreak, and sentinel mosquito sampling was West Nile virus (see Fig. 10-1\n). By 2000, the New York City outbreak included 62 confirmed cases and 7 deaths (Johnston and Conly, 2000). By that time, the West Nile virus was documented as having spread halfway across the United States to the Rocky Mountains (Roehrig, 2013).",

            "text": "On April 15, 2009, a sample was routinely tested from a young girl with influenza-like illness as part of the US sentinel influenza network. The results indicated this was a uniquely novel strain of influenza A (see Fig. 10-2\n). On April 17, 2009, a similar result was confirmed 130 miles from the originally identified case. Testing also confirmed that this virus was resistant to both amantadine and rimantadine but sensitive to both oseltamivir and zanamivir, two readily available antiviral medications. There had been sporadic cases of influenza with infection of viruses in the swine lineage, and it was suspected and later confirmed that this novel influenza A, H1N1, was a unique combination of genes most closely related to North American swine-lineage H1N1 and Eurasian swine-lineage H1N1. In the two initial cases, no contact with pigs was discovered through extensive investigation, and it was determined that this novel virus had been spread to these cases by human-to-human transmission, a new behavior for H1N1. By April 23, additional cases were identified in Texas, and samples collected from an outbreak in Mexico were also positive for this new strain. By April 26, a public health emergency, the first in the history of the United States, was declared to allow for the rapid development of a vaccine, mobilization of antiviral medications through the federally resourced Strategic National Stockpile, and enhanced surveillance through reporting and testing. Travel advisories were put into place, and upon discovery of additional cases internationally, the World Health Organization (WHO) raised the pandemic level from phase 4 to the pandemic level phase 5. The largest number of cases occurred in people between the ages of 5 and 24 years old. Major morbidity (illness) and mortality (death) occurred in pregnant women, and middle-aged people with chronic diseases and obesity, but overall the fatality rate was low. Few cases were reported in people over the age of 65, indicating that this group may have had immunity. Levels of influenza illness remained high in the summer of 2009, unusual for the North American continent. Rapid molecular analysis of the viral genome led to rapid production of a vaccine. In the late summer, the Food and Drug Administration announced the monovalent vaccine would be licensed via a \u201cstrain change\u201d pathway, which is similar to how seasonal influenza vaccines are licensed. This meant production would be expedited, since the same methods would be used as those used to produce seasonal flu vaccine and additional safety and validation studies would not need to be completed. By September, 2009, 5 months after the first case was identified, prototype vaccine was delivered to US states for use. H1N1 is now included in seasonal vaccines (Gatherer, 2009).",

            "text": "Ebola virus disease (EVD) was first described in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in sub-Saharan Africa. In December 2013, a small outbreak of EVD was reported in a forested area in southeastern Guinea (see Fig. 10-3\n). It has been postulated that the index case, a boy, was in direct contact with bats. This was the 26th reported Ebola outbreak in history but the first to be reported in West Africa. EVD then spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone, all through direct contact with the outbreak in Guinea (WHO, 2014). In Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone as of August 13, 2015, there have been over 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths. A small outbreak of 20 cases occurred in Nigeria, and one case occurred in Senegal. Several cases were reported outside of the area, mostly in healthcare or humanitarian workers returning to their home countries. There were also imported cases in the United States and Spain which led to secondary infections of medical workers but did not spread further. In both countries, the management of companion animals and environmental cleanup were challenging issues. Several factors contributed to the devastation of this epidemic: poverty, population density, infrastructure decline after years of armed conflict, serious gaps in health and medical infrastructure with little to no surge capacity, and a delay in coordinated response. In spite of the significant risk to underresourced healthcare workers (comprising 10% of the dead), a major humanitarian medical response was launched internationally. In October 2014, controls on people traveling out of the area went into effect with exit screening for symptoms, entry screening in most countries, and active monitoring of travelers in some countries after arrival. This screening program controlled movement and by actively monitoring attempts to identify people who may become ill early in the course of the disease, getting them to healthcare in a controlled manner and with appropriate infection control practices in place. Healthcare facilities and providers in many countries stockpiled personal protective equipment, implemented infection control training, and implemented screening processes in order to be prepared. On January 28, 2015, the WHO reported for the first time since the week ending June 29, 2014, that there had been fewer than 100 new confirmed cases reported. The focus of the response shifted from slowing transmission to ending the epidemic. In July 2015, results of early testing of a vaccine appeared very promising. By the end of 2015, the Ebola Outbreak in West Africa reached over 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths making it the largest Ebola outbreak in history (CDC, 2015). Prior to this, the largest was a 2000\u20132001 Uganda outbreak with 425 cases and 224 deaths (CDC, 2001). At the time this chapter was written, public health professionals around the world continued to watch closely the progression toward stopping, and continued success in recovering from, this devastating Ebola epidemic.",

At the heart of these measures is epidemiological surveillance. Identification of a new illness or disease requires surveillance systems which not only continually monitor \u201croutine\u201d illness, but also have the ability to recognize anomalies when something is not \u201croutine.\u201d As described in chapter \u201cBioterrorism,\u201d there have been extensive efforts toward developing early warning epidemiological and environmental surveillance systems for unusual diseases and pathogens. The vital link in identifying a novel disease in a community is the astute clinician. Clinicians must be able to recognize a novel disease, report it appropriately, and feel confident that the information will be quickly analyzed and acted upon. Laboratory support is vital to quickly identifying and characterizing an emerging threat. This includes testing for drug resistance to inform decision-making concerning appropriate medical countermeasures.

Characterization of the outbreak, identifying the natural course of the illness, and recognizing key risks for infection are necessary in order to learn how the new illness behaves in a population (see Fig. 10-8\n). This information will also inform control measure decisions. A priority item in the initial characterization of an outbreak is the identification of transmissibility. Unfortunately, as surveillance methods are enhanced and cases are increasingly recognized and reported, transmissibility may be a very difficult thing to quantify. For example, the current analyses of transmissibility for MERS Co-V suggest that it is not a likely pandemic threat because of its low reproduction number or \u201cr nought\u201d (R\n0). However, different cluster sizes, demographics, geographies, and public health and healthcare infrastructures may alter the outbreak characteristics and the reproduction number (R\n0) (Fisman et al., 2014). Capturing critical data will allow for accurate characterization within the context of the outbreak and will direct response activities such as control measures and medical surge management.",

Separation of potential source animals, such as exotic imported animals and poultry, from routines such as cooking can reduce risk. Effective cleaning of animal waste and habitats should be performed with at least basic respiratory protection. To prevent human-to-human transmission, good hygiene practices such as hand washing, general surface cleaning, and careful waste disposal should be reinforced. During the 2009\u20132010 H1N1 pandemic, people were advised to \u201ccough hygienically\u201d into their sleeve to prevent contamination of the hands and then others. Of note, this technique was not without some controversy and was not recommended in the United Kingdom and Spain (Anderson, 2010). Supplying hand wipes and hand sanitizer may be implemented in some locations of businesses, critical industries, and government agencies where other measures may not be reasonable. Social distancing by school closures, limiting mass gatherings, and canceling large events may be necessary (see Figure 10-10, Figure 10-9\n). Quarantine may be considered for individuals who have been exposed but are not yet sick, typically for two incubation periods of the disease. Isolation separates those who are already ill from those who are not ill. In healthcare settings, isolation may begin from early screening of patients at points of entry. This may limit disease transmission to other patients who often have underlying conditions which increase their risks for severe illnesses and complications. Risk management for communicable diseases in emergency departments includes signage to encourage patients to self-identify if they are sick or have an associated travel history. This allows for rapid triage to isolation areas and early institution of personal protective equipment for staff (Puro et al., 2008).",

The majority of the population typically complies with basic containment measures such as improved hygiene, avoiding ill people, etc. However, some individuals may be reluctant or unable to comply. For example, minimally ill people without paid sick leave may not be able to stay at home without significant economic loss. People may, out of fear, choose to flee quarantine zones. In these cases, agencies need to have flexible, scalable authorities to limit travel outside areas known to have disease. The challenges with quarantine measures were apparent throughout the international response to the 2014\u20132015 West African Ebola epidemic. In the United States as in many countries, the government has the authority to restrict state-to-state and international travel. State and local health agencies have authority to control intrastate activities. However, political pressure may make it difficult to enact some control measures. School closure is one of the more difficult decisions for government agencies during a public health emergency. For many communicable diseases, children can act as superspreaders because of their behaviors and hygiene lapses. However, many schools function not only as places of education but also deliver significant social programs: safe havens, meals, and day care for working parents with marginal income. To close these schools disrupts very necessary social welfare programs.",

Additionally, any enforcement of quarantine of an individual must be heard in the judicial system.
