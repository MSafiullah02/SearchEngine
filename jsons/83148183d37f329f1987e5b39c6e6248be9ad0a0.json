Experts conducted preliminary screenings of patients online and gave suggestions to continue to stay home or to go to the hospital. After arrival at the hospital fever clinic, clinicians determined whether patients were suspected for COVID-19. Following this initial triage, an expert conducted a remote consultation for further determination of the risk of COVID-19. Non-severe cases were assessed according to the following criteria for the severity of latent instances: (1) the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) score and (2) age > 65 years [2, 3] . These cases were reported to the expert group via telemedicine every day, thereby implementing early preventive interventions for this group of patients. For cases with severe illness, remote consultation could be arranged at any time via telemedicine. Patients discharged from the hospital were followed up via telemedicine. Telemedicine seamlessly monitored patients from initial triage through to post-discharge, while also collecting patient data to be incorporated into a future database (Fig. 2) . During the epidemic period, 582 cases were consulted in Shandong province and 15 in Hubei province. Telemedicine consulting saved time and cost, while decreasing the risk of infection distribution by avoiding close contacts with patients with COVID-19.",

Many regions do not have intensive care units (ICU) or adequate ICU medical staff. Additionally, most designated COVID-19 hospitals focus on infectious disease but lack experience in the management of critically ill patients. Experts in pulmonary and intensive care medicine and infectious diseases have different experiences and resources with regard to patient management, including oxygen therapy, intubation timing, and application of therapeutic agents like corticosteroids. Homogenizing and refining management of COVID-19 patients is vital to improving patient outcomes. The Shandong Anti-Epidemic Expert Group utilized the \"telemedicine\" platform to carry out epidemic control activities in Shandong and Hubei provinces. Also, Shandong province supported medical teams, not only in China but also around the globe. On January 23, 2020, telemedicine shared personal protection videos and conducted remote training for healthcare providers in Shandong province. Concurrently, 50 training and panel discussions were held nationwide by telemedicine. Expert panels from intensive care, respiratory, infectious disease, and traditional Chinese medicine backgrounds were invited to connect with Hubei province colleagues. Topics included diagnosis, respiratory support, circulation, immunization, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment, case discussion, personnel protection, psychological counseling, and management of critically ill patients with COVID-19. More than 500,000 individuals participated in these video conferences.",
