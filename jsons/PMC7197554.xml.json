The option to repurpose drugs represents a viable solution as aspects of the pharmacology of these drugs are known. With regards to COVID-19, chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been identified as possible therapeutic agents potentially useful in combating COVID-19. Two recent studies looking at the in vitro antiviral effect of CQ and HCQ on SARS-CoV-2 suggest that they both can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, with CQ\u2019s immunomodulatory properties enhancing its antiviral capacity.1,2",

In fact, it is a complex process from both a clinical and a regulatory perspective, requiring careful planning and assessment by clinicians, scientists, and regulatory authorities. Repurposing drugs may require deviation from the approved dosing regimens and prescribing practice in order for them to be tailored to the new disease. Such deviations give rise to more complex issues, particularly those associated with side effects and toxicity induced by the new dosing regimens.

The risks of fast intravenous injection of quinine, the striking prolongation of the electrocardiographic (ECG) QT interval triggered by quinidine, and the lethality of CQ in overdose have separately caused substantial concern.3",

Drugs that cause QT interval prolongation lead to life-threatening tachyarrhythmias in only a small proportion of patients.3,6 Fatal tachyarrhythmias can also occur in individuals whose QT intervals are within the normal range. The QT interval, although important, concerns only one of the several indicators of arrhythmic tendency, namely the APD, even excluding contributions from the cardiac effective refractory period (ERP). Studies have shown that there is a positive time difference between the APD and ERP that determines arrhythmic tendency, and this cannot be measured with the QT interval only.7",

This gives rise to confounding factors when using CQ or HCQ for the acute management of COVID-19 infection. One study assessing the safety of CQ observed a tendency to tachycardia, but with no significant differences in mean heart rate before and after CQ administration.8 Whilst a tendency to tachycardia would not be a major concern in an otherwise healthy patient, the same cannot be said for an elderly COVID-19 patient with an underlying health condition. It is worth highlighting that the authors of the studies assessing the in vitro antiviral effect of CQ and HCQ point out that the relatively low safety index of these drugs warrants a cautious approach when designing any clinical trials.1,2",

Nonetheless, a cost\u2013benefit analysis particularly taking into account adverse cardiac events in elderly patients should inform clinical decision-making.
