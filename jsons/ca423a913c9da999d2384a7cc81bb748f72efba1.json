We herein detail a case of a young patient who suffered lifethreatening disease and multiorgan failure. His clinical course involved rapid and profound respiratory decompensation such that he required support with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO). He also demonstrated hyperinflammation (C-reactive protein peak 444.6 mg/L) with severe cytokine elevation (Interleukin-6 peak > 3000 pg/ml). Through treatment targeting hyperinflammation, he recovered from critical COVID-19 respiratory failure and required only 160 hours of VV-ECMO support. He was extubated 4 days after decannulation, had progressive renal recovery, and was discharged to home on hospital day 24. Of note, repeat SARS-CoV-2 test was negative 21 days after his first positive test. We present one of the first successful cases of VV-ECMO support to recovery of COVID-19 respiratory failure in North America. ASAIO Journal XXX; XX:00-00.",

The 28-day mortality of critically ill COVID-19 patients is more than 60%. 1 Older age, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 1 hypertension, chronic kidney disease (preprint: Cheng et al., medRxiv 2020), and multisystem organ failure 1 are risk factors for mortality. Although most critical illness occurs in older patients, younger COVID-19 patients can be critically ill. 1 COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care have higher levels of viral shedding suggesting an association with disease severity, 2 but the dynamics between viral clearance and recovery from severe COVID-19 remain unclear. Further, cytokine storm and hyperinflammatory state with features overlapping CAR T-cell therapy-related cytokine release syndrome (CRS) appear to be an emerging component of severe COVID-19 illness. 2 Clinicians have few therapeutic interventions undergoing investigation for COVID-19 to supplement a patient's care. Our multidisciplinary team of cardiology, cardiothoracic surgery, hematology/oncology, infectious disease, nephrology, and pulmonary/critical care medicine present a successful report of VV-ECMO support for COVID-19 respiratory failure in North America while targeting hyperinflammation.",
