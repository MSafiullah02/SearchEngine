Indeed, based on recent reports, viruses account for 11-55% of the total infections in patients admitted to the ICU with severe respiratory distress [1, [3] [4] [5] . However, many studies have only focused on the role of influenza A virus (e.g. H1N1pdm09) as an etiologic agent of acute respiratory failure [6, 7] . Respiratory viruses other than influenza such as human rhinovirus (HRV), human parainfluenza viruses 1-4 (hPIV1-4), human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) and human coronaviruses (hCoVs) are not routinely investigated in respiratory samples of ICU patients, and their role as the cause of ICU admission might be under estimated.
