            "text": "There have been a lot of confidence-building measures rapidly instituted in the current COVID-5 19 pandemic without any scientific evidence to back them up. Foremost among these measures is 6 the so-called \"Disinfection tunnel\" or \"Sanitization tunnel\" . These are stationed outside crowded 7 places like vegetable markets, offices, shopping malls and hospitals. People can walk through 8 them, or even ride through them on two-wheelers. Essentially these tunnels spray a mist of 9 sodium hypochlorite solution. The first disinfectant tunnel was installed in China and was 10 As coronavirus is an enveloped virus, any low-level disinfectant (eg. 1% w/v 21 Sodium hypochlorite, Isopropyl alcohol) will be able to destroy it. An ideal disinfectant for 22 spraying and to be used in these tunnels should be non-volatile, require less contact time, 23 harmless to mucous membranes and skin, and should have virucidal and bactericidal activity. 24",

            "text": "There are no guidelines and evidence supporting the efficacy of these disinfectants for human 25 disinfection. These disinfectants can destroy the outer envelope of the virus, only if allowed for a 26 recommended concentration with a contact period of more than 60 sec. Reduced contact period 27 and diluted concentration limit the efficacy of these disinfectants. Direct inhalation or spray of 28 these disinfectants on human skin can be toxic and corrosive to skin and lead to various allergic 29 disorders. Even for once, if we may think that these DTs may deactivate the virus on 30 contaminated surfaces (skin and clothes of the person), any asymptomatic patient would remain 31 infective as the virus in the nasopharynx and respiratory tracts remains viable and hence 32 contributing to a false sense of security among individuals. There is no way to test the benefits, 33 other than the mental satisfaction, which is just like the confidence wearing a cloth mask 34 provides and thereby enabling people to venture out into public places. (10) We often lose sight 35 of the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to be prolonged over a few months at least and 36 therefore population-level behavioral measures will also be needed to be practiced for a long 37 period. Social distancing and hand hygiene are cumbersome and obstructive to usual life 38 therefore, a person with access to a DT may end up neglecting these standard measures. 39",
