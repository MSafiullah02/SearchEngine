A useful guideline in planning to make a purified coronavirus sample is that the final preparation should be concentrated to at least 1010 virions per milliliter if possible. For a simple proteomic analysis, less is sufficient, but as further digestions and purifications are often performed, higher amounts of infectious virus are recommended to recover enough sample for study, and to make it possible to recover a fairly complete virion proteome [1]. Likewise, the accuracy of cryo-EM results depends on both the concentration and intactness of the purified virions.",

It is also worth noting that cleaved viral spike proteins are sensitive to S1 shedding, though this susceptibility can vary considerably among viruses and even strains of the same viral species. The method of concentration and purification described here seeks to minimize virion disruption and spike loss, and has been used successfully with several coronaviruses and other enveloped viruses derived from cells and in ovo culture. The method described here is a modification of our previously published method of concentrating samples for electron microscopy, and would still be useful for that purpose [2].",

If purification in the presence of serum fails despite adequate starting virus titer, a serum-free preparation might be advantageous. For this reason an alternative serum-free purification protocol has been provided below. After concentration, but before further proteomics analysis, electron microscopy to look for virion density and spike coverage can be a useful quality control tool. The reliability of results from virion purification will depend on the percentage of cell-derived exosomal vesicles that are co-purified with the virions, although the contributions of exosome-derived proteins can be estimated by performing the same purification in parallel on uninfected cell culture supernatant. It is hoped that these techniques will facilitate further examination of coronavirus, torovirus, arterivirus, mesonivirus, and ronivirus virion proteomics.",

            "text": "This method is suitable for most coronaviruses that grow well in cultured cells, and has been used successfully with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), feline coronavirus (FCoV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), coronavirus virus-like particles, and torovirus in addition to several types of influenzavirus, arenavirus, and retrovirus-like particles [3, 4]. In the case of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), this method has been used successfully for the purification of virus from embryonated chicken eggs. For the purpose of this protocol, it is assumed that IBV is being prepared on Vero cells.Culture Vero cells in DMEM to approximately 70\u201390 % confluency (see\nNote\n2).Inoculate with IBV at a multiplicity of infection of three or more.Remove the inoculum after 1 h and replace with fresh medium.Remove and discard the culture medium 24 h after inoculation. Replace with fresh DMEM (see\nNote\n3).Collect the cell culture supernatant 48 h after inoculation. Store a small sample for plaque assay titration (see\nNote\n4).Prepare three-step 10\u201320\u201330 % sucrose gradients in tubes appropriate to the high-speed centrifuge rotor. If using the Beckman SW-32 Ti rotor, use ~8 ml for each step, leaving ~10 ml for sample loading and balancing. Pipette the 10 % sucrose into the bottom of the tube. Refill the pipette with 1 ml more sucrose solution than you will need, tilt the tube as much as possible without spilling the sample and place the pipette tip just above the bottom of the tube. Dispense the 20 % sucrose very slowly using the gravity-only setting\u2014the last 1 ml will be retained in the pipette. Carefully and slowly withdraw the pipette, and put the 30 % sucrose layer underneath the 20 and 10 % layers in the same way. There will be visible lines at the border between steps if this is done correctly (see\nNote\n5).Transfer the supernatant to the largest available screw-cap centrifuge bottles that will fit your rotor, noting the total volume. Pellet cellular debris at 10,000 \u00d7 g, 4 \u00b0C for 20 min. It is best to use a high-capacity rotor at this stage (Sorvall GSA, for example) to minimize preparation time.During the centrifugation, prepare fresh screw-cap centrifuge bottles containing 10 g of dry PEG-8000 and 2.2 g of NaCl per 100 ml of culture medium to be added. Alternatively, prepare a large conical flask with sufficient PEG-8000, NaCl, and a heavyweight magnetic stir bar to bring the entire volume of virus-containing medium to a final concentration of 10 % PEG-8000, 2.2 % NaCl.Chill HEPES-saline and neutral-buffered formalin on ice for later use (see\nNote\n6).After centrifugation (step 7), an off-white or yellow pellet of cell debris will be visible. Quickly decant the supernatant into the centrifuge bottles or conical flask prepared earlier with PEG and NaCl (see\nNote\n7).Swirl the PEG-8000/NaCl/supernatant mixture gently until the PEG crystals are fully dissolved. This can be done by hand for individual bottles, or using a magnetic stirring plate which has been incubated in a 4 \u00b0C incubator or cold room.Add a clean stir bar if one is not already present and incubate at 4 \u00b0C for a further 30 min with gentle stirring.Transfer the solution to centrifuge bottles, if necessary. Pellet the PEG-precipitated protein, which will also contain the virus, by centrifugation for 30 min at approximately 10,000 \u00d7 g at 4 \u00b0C.Decant and discard supernatants immediately to minimize the amount of virus that is lost by resuspending. A large opaque white pellet should be present in each of the flasks following centrifugation, and may run from the bottom to top of one side if you used a fixed-angle rotor.Swirl each pellet by hand in 1\u20133 ml of cold HEPES-saline until dissolved. Avoid passing the sample through a pipette at this step, if possible. It is critical that the PEG pellets be completely resuspended before proceeding to the next step. The resuspended pellet will be viscous if this step is done correctly (see\nNote\n8).Optionally, add one-tenth the volume of each pellet of Tracking dye. This can be left for 10 min with the resuspended PEG pellets, and will penetrate virions to fluorescently label the RNA inside without any additional permeabilization. This will make it possible to locate the virus-containing fraction or section of the pellet in any subsequent step, simply by resting the tube in a bottomless tube rack or clear beaker and illuminating the sample briefly with a UV transilluminator. This step is useful for troubleshooting the purification procedure.Tilt the tube containing your gradient as much as possible without spilling, to allow the resuspended pellet to run as slowly as possible down the side of the tube and onto the top of the 10 % gradient layer. It is important not to disturb the gradient layers at this stage. In this manner, overlay the resuspended PEG pellet carefully onto the sucrose gradients. Balance with remaining sample or additional HEPES-saline.Pellet the virions through the sucrose cushions by centrifugation at 100,000 \u00d7 g for at least 90 min at 4 \u00b0C. Since the pellet will be compact, it is not important to brake the centrifuge slowly.After centrifugation, decant and discard supernatants immediately. Invert the empty tubes on an absorbent surface for 5 min, and tap gently to wick away any remaining sucrose solution that may have gathered near the rim of the centrifuge tube.Resuspend the virion pellet in as small a volume of HEPES-saline as possible (typically 100 \u03bcl for a small pellet and 200 \u03bcl for a large pellet). Do not use a pipette to resuspend the virus, as this may shear spikes and damage fragile viral envelopes (see\nNote\n9).When the pellet has been resuspended, the HEPES-saline will turn somewhat opaque and milky in color. Use a P-1000 pipette tip from which the pointed end has been cut off to gently transfer the virus suspension to a cryovial with minimal shearing. Discard any insoluble material that remains, as most of the authentic virus will resuspend quickly and easily in comparison. Set aside a small sample (typically 5\u201310 % of your sample for a diagnostic plaque assay.At this stage, the virus should be monodisperse, and can be formalin inactivated if desired. Treatment with a 1 % final concentration of ice-cold neutral buffered formalin, 2-propiolactone treatment, or gamma-irradiation should all yield intact, inactivated EM-quality particles. Samples for cryo-EM may be stored at 4 \u00b0C for up to 24 h, but should not be frozen for storage. Purified virus for mass spectrometry should not be formalin fixed, but can instead be inactivated using the solvent that will be used for mass spectrometry, provided this has been validated for your virus (see\nNote\n10).\n",

            "text": "The number of infectious virus particles in the final preparation should be directly assessed by plaque assay or similar means as a retrospective measure of quality. The quickest way to assess sample quality is by EM of a negatively stained sample. Ideal samples for proteomics or cryo-electron microscopy should contain a high density of virions with intact spikes, and relatively little non-viral material. This protocol describes how to prepare a negatively stained coronavirus specimen for transmission-EM.Lay down a piece of paper towel on a work surface that is designated for work with slightly radioactive materials. Label the paper towel with the names of your samples.Lay a piece of Parafilm M large enough to cover your labels, backing side facing up, on top of the paper towel and separate the backing from the Parafilm M at one corner. Trace lines through the backing paper on a piece of Parafilm M using the back of a pair of EM forceps to create channels for droplets of stain or wash buffer. The places where lines intersect will naturally hold droplets, and the labels will help keep the samples organized.Peel off the rest of the backing paper, leaving the Parafilm stuck to the paper towel. On the Parafilm, place one ~20 \u03bcl droplet of 2 % uranyl acetate and up to three droplets of HEPES-saline wash buffer for each sample. Highly viscous samples will give a cleaner appearance after one or more wash steps, but washing is not necessary if the sample is quite pure (see\nNote\n13).Place 2\u20135 \u03bcl of the viral sample onto each grid, and leave each sample for 5 min to allow the sample to adsorb onto the grid.If you are washing your sample, balance each grid on top of each droplet of HEPES-saline for 30 s. Do not reuse buffer or stain droplets, to avoid sample contamination. In between droplets, dry the grids. Hold the grid perpendicular to a clean piece of filter paper and touch the edge of the grid to the paper. Most of the wash buffer should be carried off.After the washing steps, float each grid on a uranyl acetate stain droplet for 1 min. Longer staining will lead to more particles that appear to fill up with stain, if this is desired.Touch the edge of the grid to the filter paper several times to remove excess stain (see Note 14).Samples should be visualized immediately, and can be best stored for longer periods in a grid box that is kept under a vacuum.Ideal preparations for both proteomics and cryo-electron microscopy will contain monodisperse virions as opposed to clumps of virions, few smooth-walled exosomal vesicles, little or no stringy released ribonucleoprotein, and will have virions covering roughly one-tenth of the grid surface area.\n",

It should be noted that after digestion, removal of extra-virion proteins would lighten the density of the virion and therefore a longer centrifugation is required to repurify virus particles.A wide variety of methods are available to study the coronavirus proteome. Gel based methods are still common and virions purified by these methods are compatible with gel based analysis. Direct LC-MS analysis of coronavirus virions is also possible.

One-well plates (available from Nalgene) can a cost- and space-effective alternative to standard tissue culture flasks for large-scale virus preparation. Due to the simplicity of the proteome of the allantoic fluid of embryonated chicken eggs and the high titer of IBV that can be recovered, lower volumes of starting material can be expected.Early time points containing little virus can be discarded. Both sample purity and virus recovery are dependent on concentration.Virus can be collected at 2 h intervals beginning 48 h after inoculation to increase the final yield. However, for best results, each virus sample should be processed immediately. In general, IBV inoculated into embryonated chickens eggs can be harvested from 16 h after inoculation, but can only be harvested at a single time point.Virus can also be banded at the interface of a 30\u201350 % two-step sucrose gradient. The use of lower-concentration sucrose cushions can be used to study wild-type virions and virus particles containing defective mini-genomes that are of lower buoyant density [5].For viruses with cleaved spike proteins, such as most strains of IBV, the amount of NaCl added should be reduced to 1 g/100 ml to minimize damage to the spikes.Decanting quickly reduces the likelihood that some components of the pellet will resuspend. Ideally pellets should be separated from supernatants within 1 min of the end of centrifugation.In general, rapid resuspension, cold temperature, and the minimization of mechanical stress will all improve the quality of the preparation. Soluble proteins contained in the pellet may alter the color to a yellowish hue.The translucent virion pellet may be difficult to see and will probably not be visible before the supernatant is removed. The presence of the pellet can be confirmed by fluorescence under UV light after the supernatant is decanted, if the tracking dye was used. If a pellet is present, the viscosity of the added HEPES-saline will increase noticeably upon resuspension.Inactivation techniques should be validated beforehand. Both formaldehyde and 2-propiolactone can lose effectiveness over time. Amines in some buffers such as Tris\u2013HCl will react with formaldehyde, which is why HEPES buffer is recommended for use throughout the purification process.The growth of SARS-CoV, FCoV and MHV is not affected by short-term treatment with VP-SFM, as outlined here. However, cells do grow more slowly in VP-SFM as compared to DMEM, and thus VP-SFM is not recommended for the initial cell culture step.If left in contact with the supernatant, serum-free PEG pellets will resuspended much more quickly than serum-containing pellets, and the sample may be lost. It is therefore very important to decant the supernatants quickly with serum-free pellets.Alternatively, the sample can be applied as a droplet on which the grid is floated for 5\u201310 min. Grids that continually sink in the saline or stain droplets likely have suffered extensive damage to the support surface and should not be used.The effects of the electron beam on large amounts of residual stain can cause a \u201cblowout\u201d of the carbon-formvar support surface. It is therefore important to remove all excess uranyl acetate before visualization. If there is excess stain present, you will notice because the grid will stick to the forceps. If this happens, give the grid one more blot by gently touching the face of the grid containing the sample directly onto the filter paper, dry the forceps with another piece of filter paper, and try again.\n",
