This process aids cell survival in response to multiple stress situations such as nutrient or growth factor deprivation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), hypoxia, and the presence of intracellular pathogens. 2 Autophagy (from the Greek, \"auto\" meaning oneself, \"phagy\" meaning to eat) is a conserved intracellular homeostatic process where waste cellular components and infectious agents are surrounded by a double layer membrane to create a compartment called the phagosome. 3 The phagosome then is delivered and fuses with the lysosome compartments to degrade its contents. 4 The double layer membrane (phagophore) is most likely originated from a lipid bilayer donated by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and/or the trans-Golgi. 5 Autophagy is as a cellular recycling mechanism that generates ATP and controls damage by removing non-functional proteins and organelles. 6 In addition to its homeostatic role, autophagy also functions in caspase-independent autophagic cell death, a subset of type II programmed cell death.",

            "text": "During lack of nutrients, AMP protein-activated kinase (AMPK) negatively regulates mTOR and results in autophagy induction. 22 However, in response to insulin or growth factors, class I phosphatidylinositol 3kinase (PI3K)-triggered phosphorylation of protein kinase B (also known as Akt) activates mTOR, thus inhibiting autophagy. 21 Atg6/Beclin-1 is involved in the second pathway of autophagy induction. The interaction of Beclin-1 with vesicular protein sorting 34 (Vps34) stimulates the catalytic function of Vps34 and increases levels of phosphatidylinositol triphosphate. 23 Vps34 is specifically involved in autophagy when it interacts with Beclin-1. 24 Vps34 only phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol (PI) as substrate to generate phosphatidylinositol triphosphate, which is indispensable for phagophore elongation and recruitment of auxiliary Atg proteins to the phagophore. 23 Furthermore, Beclin-1 is a binding partner of the anti-apoptotic protein B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/ lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) protein, and BCL2-bound Beclin-1 is inaccessible for autophagosome formation. 25 Antagonistic interactions between viral proteins and Beclin-1 subvert autophagosome formation and maturation by blocking fusion with lysosomes and exacerbating virulence. 26 Other regulatory proteins, such as Rubicon, UV radiation resistanceassociated gene (UVRAG), BIF-1, Atg14L, and Ambra, form complexes with Vps34 and Beclin-1 at the ER and nucleated phagophore to both stimulate and suppress autophagy. [27] [28] [29] The third pathway that contributes to autophagosome formation and elongation involves ubiquitin-like conjugation processes that generate membrane-bound protein complexes. 30 Atg7 and Atg10 mediate the conjugation of Atg12 to Atg5, which subsequently interact with Atg16. The Atg12-Atg5/Atg16L complex binds to the outer membrane of autophagosome and then dissociates upon completion of the autophagosome. 31 The second conjugation reaction involves LC3, a mammalian homolog of yeast Atg8. The precursor proLC3 is constitutively cleaved by Atg4 to produce LC3-I. Upon receiving the signal to induce autophagy, Atg7 and Atg3 mediate the conjugation of LC3-I to the membrane lipid phosphatidylethanolamine to form LC3-II. The LC3-II integrates the outer and inner membranes of the autophagosome and helps complete membrane elongation and closure. 31 LC3 is the only reliable marker of autophagosome and autolysosome formation and is routinely detected in several cell lines. 32 The LC3 exists in 2 forms: Cytosolic LC3-I and its lipidated   derivative LC3-II. During autophagy processing, the level of membrane-associated 16 kDa LC3-II increases, while the level of soluble   18 kDa LC3-I decreases. Thus, the relative amount of LC3-II is linked to the dynamic turnover of LC3-II via the lysosomal activity. 33, 34 In this process, LC3-I is covalently conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine through LC3 lipid coupling mechanism, resulting in LC3-II. LC3-II then moves from the cytosol to the autophagosome membranes 34, 35 where it remains associated with the expanding limiting membrane, sealed autophagosomes, and mature autophagosomes/autolysosomes. [36] [37] [38] Thus, LC3-II levels usually correlate with autophagosome numbers. 34 To evaluate if substrate degradation is autophagy dependent, it is useful to perform assays measuring LC3-II levels assays in the presence and absence of a lysosomal vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase inhibitor such as Bafilomycin A1 (Baf-A1). 38 ",

During infection, autophagy can play either a pro-viral or antiviral role, depending on the virus, the cell type, and the cellular environment. 42, 43 Autophagy can function differently in response to positive-strand and negative-strand RNA viruses, DNA viruses, viral genotypes, step of viral life cycle, and stage of pathogenesis. 44 During host cell infection, viruses and viral proteins can be targeted for degradation by autophagy to stop viral replication. Conversely, some viruses have evolved strategies to avoid autophagy-induced lysosomal degradation by subverting autophagy into autophagosomal shelters harboring viral replication. In fact, these viruses exploit the autophagy pathway by replicating in the autophagosome-like structures themselves.

            "text": "Autophagy is involved in different liver physiology and pathophysiology processes, including the removal of mis-folded proteins, nutrient and lipid metabolism, regulation of selective organelle degradation, and response to hepatitis virus infection. 12 Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) are the main causes of chronic liver infection and lead to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and ultimately malignant transformation of the hepatocytes. 65 HCV is a hepatotropic membraneenveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA. 66 Infections of the Flaviviridae family such as HCV, Dengue virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus are reported to activate autophagy in cell culture experiments. 67 Upon binding to the host cell, HCV is internalized through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. 68 To release the viral nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm, the viral and endosomal membranes fuse in a pH-dependent manner. 69 HCV RNA is transported to the ER, where HCV non-structural proteins NS4B and NS5A induce ER membrane alteration (known as \"membranous web\" formation). This alteration provides a scaffold for the replication of the HCV and protects the virus from host immune defenses. 70 HCV NS4B, a membranous web formation inducer, may elicit a stress response that triggers autophagy as shown in Figure 1 . 71 Autophagy that is basal, rather than stress-induced, may provide an initial membranous platform for incoming RNA translation. Once replication is established, this platform becomes unnecessary for translation of HCV RNA progeny. 72 Growing evidence indicates that HCV infection-triggered cellular stress indirectly induces autophagy. The accumulation of mis-folded or unfolded protein in the ER causes ER stress which in turn results in the activation of 3 distinct pathways: the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and double-stranded (ds) RNA-activated protein kinase, including ER kinase (PERK). These proteins trigger downstream signaling pathways to cope with misfolded proteins. 73 This process, called the unfolded protein response (UPR), alleviates ER stress by reducing protein synthesis, upregulating ER chaperone protein expression to facilitate protein folding, and augmenting protein degradation via autophagy and the ER-associated degradation pathway. If the UPR fails to alleviate ER stress, it will induce apoptosis. 73, 74 In addition, ER stress releases calcium from the ER resulting in an increase of mitochondrial metabolic activity. This activity leads to an overproduction of ROS, which leads to mitochondrial oxidative. Damaged mitochondria are then selectively targeted for degradation by mitophagy via activation of the mitochondrial fission protein dynamin-related protein-1; this process is reported to occur during HCV infection. 75 HCV upregulates expression levels of serine/ threonine kinase PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 and Parkin (an E3 ubiquitin ligase), both of which then translocate to the outer mitochondrial membrane. The new Parkin on the mitochondrial surface recruits its substrate to induce mitophagy. 76 HCV-activated mitophagy could decrease HCV-induced apoptosis in order to promote viral persistence. 77 The HCV core protein has been revealed to stimulate both the ATF6 and PERK pathways that, in turn, enhance the expression of the ATG12 and LC3 genes. 78 Induction of autophagy and mitophagy is essential to sustain the survival of infected cells and establish a chronic HCV infection. 77 Interaction between autophagy and HCV is time dependent. The co-localization of ATG5 and HCV RNA polymerase NS5B is detected 48 hours following infection. In contrast after 5 days post-infection, the co-localization has disappeared. 79 In the normal autophagic pathway, the UVRAG enables the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes. Induced by HCV in the early stages of infection, Rubicon, RUN domain and cysteine-rich domain containing Beclin 1-interacting protein, blocks UVRAG function thus prevents fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes. 80 By contrast, the induction of UVRAG in the late stages of HCV infection disables the inhibitory effect of Rubicon, leading to the maturation of autophagosomes. [80] [81] [82] Another study demonstrated that knockdown of ATG7 and Beclin-1 reduced viral shedding without any significant effect on the intracellular viral proteins and RNA levels. 83 Lipophagy is a selective type of autophagy responsible for the degradation of intracellular lipid stores during the HCV life cycle. 84 This indicates that HCV possibly develops lipoprotein degradation using autophagy, thereby, bypassing virus-produced lipid droplet accumulation in host cells. Additionally, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy leads to a substantial accumulation of intracellular cholesterol deposits; inhibiting cholesterol synthesis by statins considerably drops autophagy levels, as well as viral replication. 85 Taken together, these data indicate that inhibition of lipid-selective autophagy might be connected to the beginning of steatosis in chronically HCV-infected patients.",

However, a recent report showed that in HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), autophagy was downregulated, FIGURE 1 The cross-talk between autophagy and HCV. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) induces autophagy to enhance virus replication rather than to block it. After HCV decapsidation, the virus genome is transferred to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and initiates replication in the ER-derived membranous web as the HCV replication platform. HCV-induced ER stress disrupts ER function and results in accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER. Cells adapt to ER stress by triggering an unfolded protein response (UPR) to restore ER homeostasis. The UPR signaling pathway includes 3 central elements, PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), ATF6, and IRE1. The UPR could stimulate an autophagy response. Under these conditions, calcium released from the ER stimulates impaired mitochondrial activity connect to excessive production of ROS. Dysfunctional mitochondria are engulfed for degradation via mitophagy. In addition, HCV promoted dynamin-related protein 1-mediated mitochondrial fission protein 1 (Drp1) leads to mitophagy. HCV replication takes place in close proximity to lipid droplets (LDs), the neutral lipid storage organelles, and this closeness enables the downstream viral morphogenetic events. A selective autophagy for lipids (lipophagy) protects cells from an excessive lipid accumulation elicited by HCV. Upon HCV infection, the host stimulates the antiviral interferon-mediated frontline. HCV employs autophagy to escape host innate immune surveillance by inhibiting IFN\u03b1 production. Furthermore, HCV replication reduced ribavirin uptake, due to reduced expression of the nucleoside transporters ENT1 and CNT1 and there was a reverse relation between the autophagic activity and the level of microRNA-224 (miR-224) in these tumor cells. 92 Autophagosomes can sequester miR-224 and subsequently degrade it. Increased miR-224 results in downregulation of its target gene Smad4, a transcription factor that activates the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway. 92 Smad4 inhibition can shift TGF-\u03b2's role from a tumor suppressor to a tumor enhancer factor. 93 The induction of autophagy is mediated by HBV X-Protein (Trans-Activator X Gene) through interaction and activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase class 3 (PI3KC3). 88 ",

            "text": "Rotavirus consists of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA 94 and causes age-dependent and life-threatening dehydrating viral gastroenteritis in children worldwide. The full mechanism by which rotavirus induces diarrhea remains unclear, but it is triggered to some extent by virus-encoded non-structural protein 4 (NSP4), which acts as a viral enterotoxin through viroporin activity. 95, 96 During rotavirus infection, NSP4 co-localizes with the LC3 protein and surrounds viroplasms, the viral factories in the cell. 97 Rotavirus hijacks the autophagy membrane trafficking pathway through NSP4 to transfer ER-associated viral proteins NSP4 and VP7 to virus producing viroplasms. 64 The interaction of NSP4 with immature virus particles at the boundary between viroplasms and NSP4/LC3-containing membranes mediates the assembly of the outer capsid proteins onto the double-layered particle, finally forming the infectious virion which is a triple-layered particle. 98 NSP4 stimulates the release of ER lumenal calcium into the cytoplasm of the host cell, thereby stimulating calcium/calmodulindependent kinase kinase-\u03b2 (CaMKK-\u03b2) that phosphorylates 5\u2032 adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to initiate autophagy. 64 Phosphorylated AMPK is able to inhibit the mTOR com- important mechanism for viral persistence and escape from immune recognition. 109 However, the term latency is quite complex for HIV-1 because the virus is still able to infect the resting CD4 + T cells at moderate levels. 110 Autophagy plays multiple roles in immunity. Besides its degradative function, the autophagy pathway plays a role in innate immunity; the pathway delivers cytosolic microbial and viral products to PRRs, known as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), in antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and DCs. 111, 112 Autophagy also controls inflammation. For example, autophagy supports the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 from macrophages, 113 curbs inflammation by downregulating type I IFN signaling, 86 captures and removes endogenous inflammasome agonists, 114 and causes immune mediator secretion. 115 In T cells, autophagy contributes to antigen presentation by MHC class II from macrophages and DCs and affects T cell repertoires and polarization. 115 In recent years, several studies uncovered that autophagy, used by the cell as an antiviral immune defense, is usurped by HIV-1 to facilitate viral protein processing and virion assembly. 116 to CD4 + T cells. 123 The secreted form of HIV-Tat blocks autophagy by activating Src-Akt and STAT3 signaling pathways, previously known to inhibit authophagy. 60 Moreover, HIV-Tat induces production of IL-10. 129 Interestingly, IL-10 inhibits autophagy initiation in uninfected bystander macrophages, independently of the presence of Env. 60 The Tat protein also dysregulates IFN-\u03b3 signaling and suppresses autophagy in macrophages. The protein inhibits STAT1 phosphorylation and reduces upregulation of LC3B and autophagosome formation. Additionally, HIV-Tat restricts mycobacteria capture by autophagosomes, thereby providing a favorable environment for opportunistic microbes in HIV-infected individuals. 130 Furthermore, the HIV-1 precursor Gag co-localized and interacted with the autophagy factor LC3, suggesting that autophagy promoted productive Gag processing and viral particle production in macrophages. 116 Taken together, these studies demonstrate that HIV evades degra- 55 This study found FIGURE 2 Schematic overview of the autophagy and HIV-1 in target cells. Autophagy, as a cell-autonomous innate defense, plays an important role against HIV-1 infection, it restricts hiv-1 infection by Tat degradation and limits virion production. However, HIV-1 proteins are able to modulate autophagy pathway by different strategy at the initiation and maturation step (Tat in uninfected macrophages; Env in dendritic cells; Vif in infected T cells; Nef in infected macrophages). In particular, in infected macrophages, Nef acts as an \"antiautophagic maturation factor\" and blocks the autophagosome maturation step. In uninfected CD4 T cells, Env-mediated autophagy leads to apoptotic cell death that downregulation of autophagy leads to a decrease in TLR-mediated innate immune response and blocks presentation of HIV-1 antigens to CD4 + T cells in the context of MHC class II (adaptive immunity). 55 Thus, disruption of autophagy in DCs could significantly contribute to HIV-1 disease progression, allowing for opportunistic infections and cancers to evade innate and adaptive immune responses.",

            "text": "Autophagy was originally characterized as a critical process for influenza virus replication. This infection triggers autophagy in different types of cells and enhances autophagosome formation and autophagic flux. 153 Baf-A1 is a highly specific inhibitor for vacuolartype proton (V-H+) pumps, which are responsible for the acidification of endosomes and lysosomes, and are necessary for influenza virus replication. 154 Administration of Baf-A1 at low concentrations effectively inhibits IAV replication without impacting host cell viability. 155 This dose of Baf-A1 inhibits the formation of autophagosomes, resulting from either an inhibition of autophagosome formation or an increase in degradative flux. However, the most common scenario with an inhibitor of autophagy like Baf-A1 is an increase in levels of LC3-II, and is indicator of increased autophagosome formation. 38 In addition, autophagy may act as an innate immune mechanism to restrict virus replication. 156 Autophagy inhibition by IAV can be considered a novel immune escape mechanism or a by-product of altered autophagosome physiology. If the viral escape mechanism is broken, virus replication and virulence are impaired 37, 157, 158 suggesting that induction of autophagosome degradation during viral infections might restrict virus replication within infected cells. 159 Viruses can upregulate autophagosome formation, or, alternatively, autophagosome degradation in lysosomes could be blocked. Several pieces of evidence support the latter scenario, whereby after influenza infection, autophagosomes do not fuse with acidic compartments. 160 Blocking autophagosome degradation would lead to accumulation of autophagosomes and LC3-II 48, 160 to evade presentation of viral antigens. 48, 160 It has been reported that autophagy is involved in the replication of IAV, and inhibiting autophagy will inhibit the replication of this virus. 161 In 2007, Dorothee Schmid found that autophagy in IAV-infected lung epithelial cells is inhibited. Autophagosomes accumulate because they do not fuse with lysosomes, leading to increased virus survival. 36 A study on the antiviral activity of statins found that the expression level of LC3-II was independent of the presence of Baf-A1, confirming that influenza virus increases autophagosome formation by LC3-II accumulation and inhibits autophagosome maturation. 162 Two viral proteins, NS1 and M2, are associated with autophagy signaling. NS1 binds to p85\u03b2, the regulatory subunit of PI3K, 163 while M2 keeps autophagy at moderate levels by limiting the degree of lysosome fusion with autophagosomes. 160 M2 protein, a virus-specific membrane protein, 164 is expressed at the surface of infected cells. It has a short (24 residues long), highly conserved extracellular N-terminal domain, an internal hydrophobic anchorage domain (approximately 19 residues long), and a C-terminal amphipathic cytoplasmic domain (54 residues long) facing inside the viral particle. 165 The M2 protein makes a proton channel involved in 2 virus replication functions. First, M2 serves as a proton selective ion channel, causing un-coating of the virus and exposure of its contents to the host cytoplasm. Second, it initiates viral replication and maturation of the haemagglutinin glycoprotein. 166, 167 In addition, the M2 protein is necessary and sufficient to block and inhibit autophagy (autophagosome maturation) and to trigger autophagy initiation. 48,168 IAV takes advantage of autophagy inhibition. Autophagy inhibition hides IAV from immune attack despite not being useful for its replication. 48 The first 60 amino acids of M2 seem sufficient for inhibition of autophagosome maturation after binding to Beclin-1. The specific inhibitor of the M2 H + channel, amantadine, could not abrogate the inhibition of autophagy flux. This suggests that a block of autophagosome maturation does not involve M2 ion channel activity. Thus, the main functional part of the M2 protein is believed to be located within the internal domain that is responsible for proton conductive activity. 48 The mTOR signaling pathway negatively regulates autophagy. 169, 170 The phosphorylated form of the effector protein kinase mTOR is known to inhibit autophagy. 171 It has been proposed that the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 induces autophagy by suppressing phosphorylated mTOR signaling. Thus, inhibition of autophagy could reduce H5N1-mediated cellular damage. 172 In terminal autophagy, mTORC2 upregulates p70S6K activity (the original natural substrate of mTORC1) required for LC3-II formation. Interestingly, when the complex mTORC2/p70S6K blocks lethal autophagy in the absence of apoptosis, drug inhibitors of lethal autophagy limit viral production in cells. 173 Increased autophagy shows altered autophagy signaling with increased mTORC1 and PI3K/mTORC2 activity and p70S6K phosphorylation. Blocking PI3K, mTORC2, or p70S6K activity prevents lethal autophagy and decreases infectious virus production. 173 Pan H et al (2914) reported that the activation of NFk B signaling promoted H5N1 pseudotyped particles-induced autophagosome formation both in human lung epithelial cell lines and mouse lung tissues.",

It has been shown that membrane-associated papain-like protease PLP2 (PLP2-TM) of SARS-CoV is an autophagy-inducing protein. PLP2-TM induces the accumulation of autophagosomes and blocks the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. Furthermore, PLP2-TM interacts with the key autophagy regulators, LC3 and Beclin 1, and promotes Beclin 1 interaction with STING, the key regulator for antiviral IFN signaling. 188 Coronavirus NSP6 proteins limit autophagosome expansion to remove host proteins that would inhibit replication. This may favor coronavirus infection by compromising the ability of autophagosomes to deliver viral components to lysosomes for degradation. 189 As evidenced by the large quantity of information gathered here, the relationship between viruses and autophagy is complex, 190 and fundamental mechanisms of autophagy involvement in viral infection are still in being elucidated.",

A study by our research team showed that when autophagy induction is promoted before virus infection, virus titer enhanced significantly 24 hours post-infection, but it was not significant 48 hours post-infection. In contrast when autophagy formation is induced after virus infection, the virus replication was inhibited 24 and 48 hours post-infection. 191 Additionally, we showed that inhibition of autophagy using 3-MA significantly reduced viral replication. 191 In chronic HCV infection, selectively autophagy induction downregulates the IFN-\u03b1 receptor-1 chain and the expression of the nucleoside transporters ENT1 and CNT1, thus leading to drug resistance. 86 Therefore, in new treatments of HCV chronic infection, it is necessary to include an autophagy inhibitor drug. On the other hand, telomerase activation is crucial for immortalization and establishment of malignant tumor cells. 192 It is well documented that telomerase activation by viral oncoproteins such as HBV X protein (HBx) 193 and HCV core 194 is connected to carcinoma.

Autophagytargeted candidate vaccine composed of 19-kDa Mycobacterium tuberculosis lipoprotein (LpqH) DNA and microtubule-associated FIGURE 3 Regulatory signaling of autophagy during influenza A virus infection. Influenza A virus as inducer of the NLRP3 inflammasome causes mitochondrial damage, which leads to the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS). NLRP3 forms an inflammasome complex with ASC and induces the production of inflammatory cytokines. Influenza A virus also binds to Beclin1 by viral M2 protein. It upregulates the expression of several autophagy related genes, which can increase the autophagic flux, and M2 also contains an LC3-interacting region (LIR), which is required for influenza virus subversion of autophagy which leads to LC3 redistribution to the plasma membrane in infected cells protein light chain-3 (LC3) gene, which transfers LpqH to autophagosomes able to enhance protective efficiency against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Mice immunized with the aforementioned candidate vaccine had lower mycobacterial loads in the lung and spleen with increased IgG2a and IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 levels. 196 Our team formulated Beclin-1, an autophagy initiator, as an adjuvant with an HEV candidate DNA vaccine in a mouse model. The immunized mice induced robust immune response 197 but have not significant effect on HEV protein candidate vaccine. 198 The role of autophagy in apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells, adaptive immunity by viral processing and MHC-antigen presentation, and in innate immunity by affecting pathogen sensing opens novel approaches for an HIV-1 vaccine and combination treatment strategies. 199 Autophagy controls immunogenic signaling throughout cancer therapy which can be exploited to design therapeutic combinations with methods that either activate or inhibit autophagy to promote the therapeutic efficacy of oncolytic virus immunotherapy. 200 Many viruses use the host autophagy pathway, but relatively little is known regarding the specific mechanisms by which viruses manipulate autophagy for their gain. We hypothesize that autophagy may be important for the maturation of viral particles and proteins that need to be processed and cleaved with cellular protease under acidic condition. Upon virus escape to cytoplasm, positive strand RNA viruses initiate polyprotein synthesis. The viral precursor protein may be engulfed by autophagy and delivered to the lysosome for processing by cellular protease. For example, the HIV-1 precursor Gag interacts with the autophagy factor LC3, suggesting that autophagy promoted productive Gag processing and that viral particles were produced in macrophages. 116 ",

Although our knowledge of the autophagy pathway is quickly progressing, there is still much to be learned regarding the specific molecules that regulate this pathway and the mechanisms by which viruses target these molecules to facilitate their replication. Further investigations are required to be examined in preclinical and clinical trials.",

Inhibiting autophagosome maturation may help the rotavirus evade the antiviral function of autophagy, although it is unclear whether rotavirus inhibits autophagosome maturation directly or indirectly. Rotaviruses that use 2 non-structural proteins, NSP4 and NSP2, can de-polymerize the microtubule network 100,101 and render the cell incompetent for autophagy processing, because microtubules are essential for autophagosome membrane trafficking.102 Recently, it was reported that rotavirus induces autophagic signals to promote virus replication while also suppressing protein degradation. Rotavirus infection enhances expression of several stressrelated genes, which suggests that NSP4 may be involved in the lipolysis of viroplasms via lipophagy.103 In addition, it was reported thatlipidated LC3 plays an important role exclusively in the late stages of the viral life cycle to enhance virus replication. 104,105 2.5 | Autophagy involved in HIV infection in a cell type dependent manner Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is caused by HIV. HIV targets and replicates in vital cells of the human immune systemnumbers drop below this critical level, the immune system loses its ability to fight opportunistic diseases, which are the principal causes of mortality in HIV-infected patients. The mechanism by which the virus depletes these cells has not been fully elucidated but appears to result from viral strategies employed during multiple parts of its life cycle to evade the innate and adaptive immune responses and to ensure viral persistence. A major challenge for developing a cure for HIV is the existence of a quiescent pool of infected cells. In the latent phase, HIV pro-viruses persist in long-lived cells, such as hematopoietic stem cells, central memory CD4 + T cells, DCs, and cells from the monocyte-macrophage lineage including microglial cells, which are the main HIV reservoirs in the central nervous system (CNS). 107 The potential mechanisms of HIV persistence have been discussed recently in a review by Hong and Mellors 108 .

HIV-1 infects a variety of immune cells, but its largest cytopathic effect is the shrinkage of CD4 + T cell population117,118 through mechanisms including pyroptosis of abortively infected T cells,119 apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells, 120 direct viral killing of infected cells, and killing of infected CD4 + T cells by CD8 cytotoxic lymphocytes.121 In the context of autophagy, depletion of the CD4 + T cell population during HIV-1 infection is proposed to occur by Env-to the activation of mTOR and subsequent phosphorylation and activation of p53. Activated p53 increases the expression of Bax and activates the mitochondrial death pathway. These data suggest that HIV-1 manipulates autophagy during infection to circumvent the immune response. Accordingly, a significant increase in the autophagic activity has been detected in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of elite controllers; individuals may remain asymptomatic for more than 10 years due to their ability to maintain a viral load below the limits of detection in the absence of antiretroviral therapy.126 A study by Sagnier et al found that autophagy restricts HIV-1 infection by selectively degrading the viral trans-activator Tat, highlighting the anti-HIV effect of authophagy. 127 Interestingly, HIV-1 has evolved strategies to counteract the antiviral effect of autophagy. For example, the viral protein Vif can inhibit the early steps of autophagy, allowing for the productive infection of CD4 + T cells. 128 HIV-1 negative factor protein (Nef) inhibits autophagosome maturation in infected macrophages through its association with Beclin 1, thereby avoiding degradation. 22 In DCs, HIV-1 Env has been proposed to increase cell-associated HIV-1 by activating mTOR and S6-kinase (S6K), thus inhibiting autophagy and transferring infection into CD4 + T cells (trans-infection). 55 Cells belonging to the monocyte-macrophage lineage are more resistant to cytopathic effects and are able to harbor viruses for longer time periods.

The role of autophagy in HIV infection is different in macrophages than it is in DCs or CD4 + T cells because, HIV-1 infected cells from the monocyte-macrophage lineage are more resistant to apoptosis, a major obstacle to eradication of the virus. Therefore, autophagy could be a possible key player in macrophage reservoir promotion for the virus. Dendritic cells (DCs), which are located in the mucosa (including oral and vaginal mucosal surfaces) and lymphoid tissues, are crucial in the generation and regulation of immune responses to HIV infection. DCs play a pivotal role in the early dissemination of HIV, likely among the first cells that encounter HIV during sexual transmission. 131 However, the role autophagy plays in DCs during HIV infection has been understudied.

This suggests that dysregulation of autophagy may be important in the pathogenesis of neuroAIDS. 143 Previous reports demonstrated that inflammatory molecules released by simian immunodeficiency virus-infected microglia significantly reduced the autophagy processing in neurons resulting in decreased neuronal survival. This reduction of autophagy was correlated with an accumulation of sequestosome-1/p62 in neurons from cell cultures. Similar phenotype of p62 aggregations have been discovered in the post-mortem brains of HIV demented patients when compared with subjects without neurological disease. 144",

This also confirmed that H3N2 induced autophagy in both A549 and Ana-1 cells. 181 Influenza A virus induces the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) family, including the pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, causing mitochondrial damage and leading to the release of ROS. NLRP3 forms an inflammasome complex with ASC (essential adaptor of inflammasomes) and caspase-1, thus inducing the production of IL-1\u03b1 and IL-18 in response to mitochondrial ROS. Deficiency in autophagy results in the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria. This event produces excessive ROS upon stimulation, which potently activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. 182 Upon infection with IAV, the cytosolic PRR Nod2 and its downstream regulator RIPK2 induce mitophagy by inducing phosphorylation of ULK1 to prevent excessive activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. 183 As illustrated in Figure 3, influenza A virus can be involved in IAV interaction with the host autophagy pathway in several ways, including the following: 1. ROS production, which prevents the conversion of LC3-II to LC3-I by degrading Atg4 and leads to increased levels of LC3-II; 2. Binding between viral M2 protein and Beclin 1; 3. Upregulation of the expression of several ATG, which increase autophagic flux; and 4. IAV subversion of autophagy through the LC3-interacting region (LIR) on M2, which leads to LC3 redistribution to the plasma membrane in infected cells. 184 Influenza virus induces the autophagosome accumulation by blocking autophagosome degradation. Previously, it was hypothesized that M2 protein causes this accumulation by preventing autophagosome fusion with lysosomes, and that the proton channel activity of M2 is involved in this blocking activity. In fact, Gannage et al showed that M2 proton channel activity is not involved in blocking autophagosome fusion with lysosomes. They verified this result by using amantadine hydrochloride, an inhibitor of M2 ion channel activity, which was unable to prevent autophagosome accumulation in IAV-infected cells. Finally, they showed that the N-terminal domain of M2 blocks autolysosome formation and acts independently of its proton channel function.",
