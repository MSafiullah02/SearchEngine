In 2017, the narrowly-defined digital economy accounted for about 6.9 percent of the GDP in the U.S., 6 percent of the GDP in China, and 4.5 percent of the GDP in the global economy; whereas based on the broad definition, the respective numbers were 21.6 percent in the U.S., 30 percent in China, and 15.5 percent globally (2019 Digital Economy Reprot, United Nations). Despite the differences in the definition and measurement, there is no doubt that the digital economy is impacting every aspect of our lives. In fact, if we consider the digital economy as encompassing all economic activities that use or are facilitated by digitized data, then it is essentially the entire economy. 1 New digital technology and the Internet have drastically reduced the costs of search, entry, transportation, and reproduction, unleashing enormous potentials for enhancing economic efficiency (Goldfarb and Tucker, 2019) . At the same time, these cost changes raise new challenges for the organization of markets, especially because of their profound impacts on the role of platforms, the value and protection of innovation, and the trade off between firms' data usage and consumer privacy. In this paper, I review the insights from some recent studies on the opportunities and challenges in the digital economy, especially on issues related to platforms, innovation, and consumer data, and discuss how well-designed policies can improve market performance.",

However, the Internet has also substantially lowered entry and consumer search costs, which has greatly expanded the size of markets and increased the number of firms a consumer can access. The lower entry cost may also lead to a reduction of average firm quality in the market, as entry becomes profitable also for low-quality firms. Platforms thus become especially valuable as information intermediaries in the digital economy. Recent research has shown that by coordinating and guiding consumer search, a search platform can improve market efficiency (e.g., Athey and Ellison 2011; Chen and He, 2011) . However, a platform may have distorted incentives when, for instance, it is partially vertically integrated (e.g., de Corni\u00e8re and Taylor, 2014; White, 2013; .A platform may also perform poorly in guiding consumer search when product quality is not (perfectly) observable. Due to network effects and other factors, platforms often possess enormous market power and may abuse their market dominance.

This is especially true because many digital products have the distinctive property of low reproduction and transportation costs. Therefore, on the one hand, it is feasible and efficient for one firm to serve a large market with an innovative product, so that the innovation becomes more valuable; while on the other hand, strong intellectual property rights-particularly patent protection-is needed in order to deter imitation and provide desirable innovation incentives. The literature on the economics of innovation has devoted increasingly more attention to sequential or cumulative innovation, where the effects o f patent policy are very different from those for a single innovation. I will focus on two recent studies that yield new insights on how patent policy may improve an industry's performance in innovation. Chen, Pan, and Zhang (2018) analyze how patentability standard impacts the rate and direction of innovation, where the rate of industry innovation is shown to vary with patentability standard in an inverted-U shape. Chen and Sappington (2018) study the optimal rule for patent infringement damages in a seque ntial innovation environment. As I shall also discuss, as the values of innovation rise and the costs of imitation fall, IP protection and innovation will play vital roles for economic development in the digital age. Furthermore, the increase in IP protection and the reduction in search cost increase the efficiency of the market for technology, giving rise to more external innovation rather than internal innovation.",

First, firms may use consumer purchase history to engage in price discrimination (e.g., Chen, 1997; Fudenberg and Tirole, 2000) . Second, consumers may have an intrinsic preference for privacy and hence suffer from the collection of their personal information by firms.

For example, shopping malls have traditionally served as intermediaries for consumers who search for products from different sellers. As transactions are increasingly mediated through digital technology and the Internet, consumers can access products at lower search costs. Will the lower search costs in the digital economy reduce the need for intermediaries? To answer this, one must recognize that digitization and the Internet have also greatly expanded the market, and consumers now face a much larger set of sellers to choose from. This market size effect appears to be the dominant force, making intermediaries more valuable for facilitating transactions between sellers and products in the digital economy.

The se llers differ in quality, with a higher-quality seller offering a product that is more likely to meet a consumer's need. A seller's quality is its private information. Each consumer must incur a search cost to visit a seller, through which the consumer uncovers whether the seller's product is a match for her. In equilibrium, a higher-quality seller is willing to bid more for placement at a higher position on the platform, because he expects that a consumer searching his site is more likely to find a match and make a purchase. Moreover, sellers set the same price because each consumer has the same value Because of the tremendous market power that platforms possess, antitrust agencies have taken actions to prevent exclusionary practices by them in order to preserve competition.

            "text": "Another direction to extend the analyses in Athey-Ellison and Chen-He is to relax their assumption that consumers can observe product quality when they search the firm. That is, instead of assuming products to be \"inspection goods\", we need to consider them as \"experience goods\" in many situations, especially for online purchases where the quality of a product may not be learned before purchase. As Chen, Li, and Zhang (2020) demonstrate, a decrease in consumer search cost for experience goods can then reduce consumer and total welfare, because the resulting low price/profit will reduce the gain from the reputation of being a high-quality seller, which in turn lowers firms' incentive to invest in product quality. For experience goods, a platform may no longer be able to perform efficient sorting of sellers, because a low-quality seller may potentially receive a higher profit from attracting a consumer. This can potentially explain why online markets tend to have, on average, lower product quality than traditional brick-and-mortar stores. For example, in a recent investigation by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), 20 of the 47 products purchased from third-party sellers on 5 popular consumer websites, including Amazon and Walmart, were counterfeits. 4 Apparently, in the example above the online platforms have not been effective in sorting out the counterfeit sellers. Part of the problem is how to motivate a platform to exert more effort to deter sellers of fake/low-quality products. Reputation can be a mechanism to motivate the platform to act as a responsible gatekeeper on product quality. While some of the sellers are \"short-term\" players that may have a low incentive to establish reputation, the platform can be the \"long-term\" player with a stronger reputation to establish and protect For reputation to work well, however, consumers will need to have choices from competition, which may be limited due to the dominant market positions of some platforms. But even with competition, the reputation mechanism can be fragile and does not provide sufficient incentives, and product liability can be an effective incentive mechanism. In fact, competition and the desired product liability may possibly exhibit a non-monotonic relationship (e.g., Chen and Hua, 2017), and it could be desirable to impose product liability not just on sellers, but also on the platform.",

The increase in entry costs, possibly in the form of a licensing fee, a certification of qualifications, or a minimum quality standard. can raise product quality and boost both consumer and total welfare. If innovation were a one-time activity that ends with the successful introduction of a new product, a (marginal) increase in the patentability standard would discourage R&D in the risky direction by making it harder to obtain a patent through this direction, generating the threshold effect. However, if innovation is cumulative, with challengers conducting R&D that may lead to a follow-up innovation that replaces the current leader, a higher patentability standard increases the value of being a leader because it will take longer before the leader is replaced by a successful challenger. This incumbency-prolonging effect can potentially increase the incentive for R&D in both innovation directions, because challenges will receive higher rewards from succeeding in a patentable innovation.",

Conversely, a decrease of R&D in one direction has the opposite effect. As Chen, Pan, and Zhang demonstrate, this dynamic strategic substitution effect between the two directions, together with the incumbency-prolonging effect, leads to novel effects of patentability standards on innovation. Specifically, as patentability standards rise, the industry rate of innovation initially goes up and eventually falls down, reaching its maximum at some intermediate level; and R&D intensity in the risky direction exhibits a similar pattern. Furthermore, industry R&D is biased towards (against) the risky direction under lower (higher) patentability standards.",

Traditionally, economists have focused on demand-based differential pricing -classic third degree price discrimination-for different consumer groups. But in many situations, differential pricing for a product is at least partially motivated by differences in the (marginal) cost to serve different groups of consumers. As shown in Chen and Schwartz (2015) , the welfare effects of cost-based DP differ markedly from those of demand-based DP. Specifically, while demand-based DP tends to raise average market price and lower consumer welfare, cost-based DP has no such tendency and will increase aggregate consumer surplus for a broad class of demand functions. Therefore, to evaluate the potential welfare effects of a firm's access to personal data for the purpose of differential pricing across consumer groups, it is imperative to distinguish between data for learning about cost of service versus about demand elasticity, with data for cost information being less likely to have detrimental effects. 12 History-based price d iscrimination is a widely -observed business practice in the dig ital age. For examp le, phone companies and banks ofte offer new-customer discounts that discriminate against repeat purchasers, whereas airlines offer loyalty programs that reward repeat customers. After making a purchase fro m an online retailer, customers may receive a discount from the retailer for the next purchase. 13 preference. While some of these efforts enable firms to better serve consumers, the private and social incentives generally differ for marketing innovations that gather consumer information (Chen, 2006) .

In particular, if consumers believe that there is strong privacy protection, they are more likely to permit the use of their information by firms. Stringent privacy regulation can thus enable firms to commit to strong protection of consumer data, which leads to more information sharing from consumers and in turn is conducive to innovation.

Anticipating the sellers' strategy and their paid placements, consumers have the incentive to visit sellers sequentially in the descending order of their positions on the platform. The platform thus effectively acts a coordination device, enabling consumers to search more efficiently-finding a match with less expected search cost-and enabling high-quality sellers to reach more customers. 3 In Athey-Ellison and Chen-He, position auctions by the platform provide efficient sorting of sellers. Subsequent research has relaxed some of their assumptions in several directions. For instance, several authors have considered the possibility that the platform has bias when guiding consumer search, possibly because it is (partially) vertically integrated and wishes to direct consumers to its own products away from competitors' offerings (e.g., Burguet, Caminal, a nd Ellman, 2015; de Corni\u00e8re and Taylor, 2014; White, 2013). In fact, Google was accused of having acted illegally by giving priority placement in search results to its own shopping service, while relegating results from rivals to areas where potential buyers were much less likely to click.

            "text": "As market expands with digitization, a new product can reach more consumers and have higher demand. This potentially increases the value of innovation, suggesting one possible reason for the apparent acceleration of worldwide innovations in recent years, measured by the number of patent applications. In 2017, innovators around the world filed 3.17 million patent applications (43% of them from China), representing an eighth consecutive year of growth. There were 13.72 million patents in force worldwide in 2017, of which around 2.98 million were in force in the U.S., 2.1 million in China, and 2 million in Japan (WIPO, 2019). Digital products often have low reproduction cost, even though they may require substantial up-front investment. This suggests that intellectual property rights (IPRs) can be crucial for promoting innovation in the digital economy. A central issue for innovation economics in the digital economy thus concerns how to protect IP rights, especially how to design optimal patent policies when innovations are cumulative in nature, with current innovations building on past ones.Chen, Pan, and Zhang (2018) investigate how patent policy, specifically patentability standards, may affect the rate and direction of cumulative innovation in an industry where firms can conduct R&D in multiple directions.5 They consider a situation where there are two research directions, A and B , for a sequence of innovations (or new products) that deliver higher product qualities over time. An innovation in direction B produces a quality improvement of stochastic sizes ranging from low to high, whereas an innovation in d irection A produces a more certain quality improvement with an intermediate size. They consider the range of patentability standards5 The study of R&D direction under comulative innovation has attracted the attention of several authors recently.SeeBryan and Lemus (2017) andHopenhayn and Squintani (2016). innovations in direction A are always patentable while an innovation in direction B is patentable only if its realized quality improvement is sufficiently large. Thus, A is the safe R&D direction and B the risky direction.",

            "text": ". Chen and Sappington consider damage rules that are linear combinations of LP and UE, coupled with a lump-sum transfer between the innovators. Under a linear rule, if firm 2 is found to have infringed firm 1's patent, firm 2 is required to deliver a damage payment ( D ) to firm 1 that has three components: a lump sum monetary payment ( m ), a fraction ( 1 d ) of the amount by which firm 2's operation reduces firm 1's profit, and a fraction ( 2 d ) of firm 2's profit. Thus, linear rules generalize the LP rule and the UE rule, including the former (simplicity, Chen and Sappington show that an optimally-designed linear rule achieves the highest welfare among all balanced damage rules (in which all payments are internal to the industry). This is the case because linear rules allow substantial control over the key determinants of welfare. Specifically, the selected values of 1 d and 2 d affect pricing decisions, and thereby influence the allocation of industry output between the suppliers. The values of 1 d 7 The recent protracted patent infringement ligation between Apple and Samsung provides an illustration for this point (e.g., Vascellaro, 2012).

With rather limited time that a patent officer can devote to assessing the merits of an individual patent application, the validity of a patent. may be successfully contested in court. affect total industry profit and their allocations between the suppliers to influence their innovation activities. The lump-sum payment ( m ) facilitates the desired allocation of industry profit. The optimal linear rule typically differs from both the LP and UE rules, and often results in a substantial increase in welfare relative to both of them. Furthermore, the optimal linear rule can ensure the first-best outcome, under which each firm innovates if and only if its",

            "text": "economy also brings about significant changes to how R&D and innovation are organized. Firms can choose to pursue an innovation either internally or externally. Internal innovation allows the firm to fully utilize its own R&D resources and to achieve better coordination of R&D and production, but it places (more server) limitations on innovation opportunities and successes. External innovation, through mechanisms such as acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures, and licensing, furnishes a larger set of innovation opportunities, but may have higher transaction costs. As innovation proliferates, search frictions fall, and IP protection strengthens, the market for innovation and technology transfer becomes both more needed and more efficient in the digital economy. This has led to a shift in the pattern of innovation towards external innovation. According to a study by the Boston Consulting Group,9 companies are increasingly using acquisitions and corporate venture capital to acquire new ideas and technologies from startups and other external sources. Cisco Systems, for example, has maintained its lead in networking technology in part by making more than 175 acquisitions betwee 1993 and 2016. Facebook paid a total of $3 billion for Instagram and Oculus VR. Gilead Sciences' $11 billion acquisition of Pharmasset was pivotal for the development of breakthrough treatments for hepatitis C. Some of the largest technology companies have fueled their growth through acquisitions. For example, between its founding in 1998 and January 2020, Google made 240 acquisitions. The increased importance of external innovation is not without concerns and controversies, especially when the acquistion of innovation from a (potential) rival negatively impacts competition. In February 2020, the Federal Trade Commission issued special orders to five large technology firms, Alphabet (including Google), Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft, requiring them to provide information about prior acquisitions not reported to the antitrust agencies. \"The orders will help the FTC deepen its understanding of large technology firms' acquisition activity, including ...whether large tech companies are making potentially anticompetitive acquisitions of nascent or potential competitors... \" 10 While the acquisition of a potential rival may decrease competition, the issue of how strict antitrust restrictions should be on acquisitions in innovative industries is actually more complicated. Startups are driven to innovate and are able to receive VC funding, partly because there is the prospect for them to be acquired when they succeed in investing in risky innovations. Restrctions on acqusitions could adversely affect the innovation incentive by startups. The design of policies that both encourage innovation and promote competition remains a challenging task fo r economic researchers and policy makers. 114. CONSUMER DATA AND PRIVACY PROTECTIONA central part of the digital economy is digital technologies to gather and store data. In recent years, we have witnessed an exponential growth in digital data over the Inter net. Global Internet Protocol traffic, a proxy for data flows, has grown dramatically from 100 GB per day in 1992 to 46,600 GB per second in 2017, and is expected to grow to 150,700 GB per second in 2022 (2019 Digital Economy Reprot, United Nations). Firms have greatly expanded their use of big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and digital platforms to develop new products and serve consumers. Access to data and the capability to utilize data have become essential for the competitiveness of firms in the digital economy. The growing ability of firms to analyse and process massive amounts of data, in particular, is crucial to the developments in artificial intelligence (AI).
