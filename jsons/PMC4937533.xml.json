In dogs, reported infectious agents leading to interstitial pneumonia are Angiostrongylus vasorum, Leishmania chagasi, Toxoplasma gondii, Pneumocystis carinii, Babesia canis, Leptospira sp., Mycoplasma sp, canine distemper virus and adenovirus [4\u201312]. In patients with interstitial pneumonia, gas exchange is often impaired due to ventilation-perfusion mismatching, intrapulmonary shunting, and decreased diffusion across the abnormal interstitium with arterial hypoxia as a consequence. In contrast to the systemic vasculature that responds with arterial vasodilation to better perfuse hypoxic tissue, the pulmonary vasculature constricts in response to hypoxia. Besides pulmonary vasoconstriction, hypoxia also causes proliferation of the smooth muscle cells in the arterial wall. Both phenomena lead to a decrease in luminal cross-sectional area and an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance index with pulmonary hypertension (PH) as a consequence.",

A negative result from a PCR test can occur when organisms in circulation are below the level of detection, as may happen when infections are chronic. It has been demonstrated that dogs can be PCR negative on blood samples, but PCR positive on splenic aspirates [21]. It is hypothesized that the E. canis are sequestered in splenic macrophages to avoid immune elimination. Unfortunately, in the present case, the owners declined fine needle aspirates of the spleen due to the potential risks and stress involved, e.g. internal bleeding, aggravation of the dyspnea. Paired serology samples can also provide useful information about antibody kinetics, which may point to current status of infection. A four-fold increase in IgG antibodies over time is suggested to be evidence for an active infection [24]. Antibody titers will decrease gradually after appropriate treatment, but may persist for months to years even after full clinical recovery [23, 25]. In this case, the Ehrlichia IgG titer was still very high 17 days after initiation of doxycycline therapy, probably due to the short time between start of the treatment and retesting; IFAT was unfortunately not repeated on day 50.",

Both CME and HME animal models also revealed prominent mononuclear cellular infiltration in the interalveolar septa, endothelial damage and vasculitis in the lungs [16, 29]. This could explain the pulmonary changes found in this dog and the clinical and radiographic improvement after treatment with doxycycline. However, recently, acute resolution of patchy pulmonary alveolar infiltrates has been described after sildenafil therapy in dogs with idiopathic PH and PH secondary to idiopathic lung fibrosis [30]. Therefore, sildenafil therapy might also have contributed to the improvement of the radiographic changes in this case. Another explanation for the radiographic abnormalities and the improvement on doxycycline therapy that cannot be excluded is that the dog suffered from a bacterial pneumonia.",

In people, it is increasingly recognized that patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension have dysregulated coagulation and antithrombotic homeostasis, which may contribute to a prothrombotic state [33]. Unfortunately, we did not perform diagnostic investigations such as D-dimer concentration [34], computed tomography pulmonary angiography [35] or thromboelastography (TEG) [36, 37] to investigate if the dog suffered from PTE or a prothrombotic state. However, to the author\u2019s knowledge, PTE has never been associated with CME in veterinary literature.

If the PH is not controlled by primary disease therapy or if the PH is idiopathic, treatment with pulmonary arterial dilators may be implemented. In veterinary medicine currently, only phosphodiesterase inhibitors are used. Sildenafil is a highly selective phosphodiesterase five inhibitor that has been used in veterinary medicine with encouraging results [30, 40]. Pimobendan, a calcium-sensitizing agent with phosphodiesterase three inhibiting actions has also been used, especially when left heart disease is a contributing cause [41]. In the present case, a dual therapy with pulmonary arterial dilators was initiated, because we hoped this would ameliorate the very severe PH and clinical signs faster than a monotherapy with sildenafil. Although recovery has been described in a similar case with just a monotherapy with doxycycline [19], we believe that the symptomatic support with pulmonary vasodilators was justified in this dog. Mild to moderate improvement of tricuspid regurgitation gradient by sildenafil therapy has been described in some dogs with PH [30], but not in others [42]. Consequently, we cannot rule out that the improvement of the echocardiographic changes could also be partially explained by the use of the vasodilating drugs. Ideally, another echocardiogram should have been performed after discontinuation of the vasodilator therapy. However, the improvement was so dramatic, that we do not believe that this could be solely explained by the vasodilator therapy.",
