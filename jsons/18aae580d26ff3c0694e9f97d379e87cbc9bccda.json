We investigated the evolution of human transmissibility through parallel analyses of 1755 virus genome sequences from 39 RNA virus genera. We identified 57 lineages containing human-transmissible species and estimated that at least 74% of these lineages have evolved directly from non-human viruses in other mammals or birds, a public health threat recently designated \"Disease X\". Humantransmissible viruses rarely evolve from virus lineages that can infect but not transmit between humans. This result cautions against focussing surveillance and mitigation efforts narrowly on currently known human-infective virus lineages and supports calls for a better understanding of RNA virus diversity in non-human hosts. Introduction 1 Ebolavirus in 2014-15 and SARS coronavirus in 2003 are examples of infectious disease 2 epidemics resulting from the emergence of RNA viruses from non-human reservoirs 1 . 3",

This view 40 emphasizes the role of virus genetic diversity within the reservoir, with humans acting as 41 \"sentinels\" 10 , revealing the presence of L2 or L3/4 viruses through contact with the reservoir. 42 New L3/4 viruses can emerge by any of three routes: i) directly from viruses in a non-human 43 reservoir (L1) at a rate given by parameter a; ii) step-wise via a strictly zoonotic (L2) phase in 44 a non-human reservoir or, less probably, in infected humans at rates given by parameters b and 45 c; or iii) diversification of human-transmissible (L3/4) virus lineages within humans or, 46 possibly, a non-human reservoir. We note that human infectivity and transmissibility are products of convergent evolution, with their molecular and genetic determinants differing 48 across virus taxa 9 , and that the rates of evolution of these traits represented by parameters a, b 49 and c are likely to vary between lineages. given their importance, we performed separate analyses of these taxa. some virus species, we differentiated between recognised subtypes that differ in 68 infectivity/transmissibility (IT) level (see Data File 4) .",

At the species/subtype level human viruses also 127 found in non-human primates were most likely to be L3/4 rather than L2; those also found in We recognise that there will be significant gaps in our knowledge of mammal/bird non-RT 143 RNA virus diversity: new species are routinely being identified 8 and virus genome sequences 144 are accumulating rapidly ( Figure S1 ). Our selection procedure resulted in a data set with only 145 28% of virus sequences from human hosts, but it is still likely that the phylogenetic diversity 146 of viruses from non-human hosts is greatly underestimated relative to that from humans 3,14 , 147 noting that for many mammal/bird taxa no RNA viruses at all have yet been reported. There 148 will also be gaps in our knowledge of IT level: some viruses originally classified as L1 have 149 been subsequently found to human infective; and some viruses originally classified as L2 have 150 been subsequently found to be human transmissible as epidemiological data accumulates 6 . As 151 new virus sequences are added and IT levels are assigned or (occasionally) re-assigned it is 152 entirely possible that the estimated ancestors of some L3/4 viruses will change. However, we 153 anticipate that the impact of such changes across the whole data set will be to strengthen our 154 main conclusions. This is because we anticipate that far more L1 viruses will be added than 155 L2, and more L2 than L3/4, continuing the current trend ( Figure S1 ). For this reason, we 156 consider our estimate that 74% of L3/4 viruses arose from L1 lineages to be conservative.",
