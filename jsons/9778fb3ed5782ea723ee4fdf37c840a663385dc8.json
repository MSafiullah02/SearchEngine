For instance, one of the major suborders, Yinpterochiroptera, has an exclusively Old World distribution, and within the other, Yangochiroptera, no species and only five genera are common to both. However, as bats are sometimes blown out to sea, and have colonised isolated islands, occasional natural movement between the New and Old Worlds does appear to be possible. Here we identify new genotypes of a blood parasite, Trypanosoma dionisii, in Old World bats that are closely related to South American strains. Using highly conservative calibration points, divergence of Old and New World strains is estimated to have occurred 3.2-5.0 million years ago (MYA), depending on the method used (upper 95% CL for maximum time 11.4 MYA).

Therefore these bat trypanosomes can only be assigned to the T. cruzi subgenus T. (Schizotrypanum) sp. based on morphology alone. As little is known of the host specificity of most bat trypanosomes, their diversity may have been considerably over-or underestimated (Hoare, 1972) .

Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples using the DNeasy Kit (Qiagen Inc.), using negative controls to test for contamination during DNA extraction.

Dates were calculated from the optimal ML tree using PATHd8 ( Fig. 1) (Britton et al., 2007) and BEAST v. 1.6.1 using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach . Posterior probability distributions of node ages were obtained using GTR with rate variation (six gamma categories) and an uncorrelated log-normal model of rate variation. As, under certain circumstances, BEAST may become stuck on local optima, monophyletic clades (indicated in Fig. 1 ) were predefined in order to obtain a topology that corresponded to the phylogeny obtained from more robust phylogenetic methods based on more comprehensive concatenated datasets (Hamilton et al., 2007; McInnes et al., 2009) . A Yule tree prior (Yule, 1925) was employed, which assumes a constant speciation rate for each branch on the tree, although the population structures of T. dionisii and most other trypanosome species are not known. Two independent MCMC chains were run for a minimum of 20,000,000 generations (burn-in 20%), with parameters sampled every 1000 generations. In order to assess that the MCMC chains were had stabilized, lnL plots were examined using Tracer v. 1.4 . Four host-restricted trypanosomatid clades, which received robust bootstrap support in trees based on concatenated 18S rDNA and gGAPDH genes (Hamilton et al., 2007; McInnes et al., 2009 ), were used for calibration. The oldest estimated divergence dates for their host groups were used as the maximum times of divergence of the parasite clades, as host-restricted parasites are likely to have diversified after diversification of their hosts (Stevens and Rambaut, 2001) . We used 390 \u00b1 \u00bd million years ago (MYA) for the origin of trypanosomatids, based on the origin of insects (Gaunt and Miles, 2002) ; evidence suggests that the ancestral trypanosomatid was an insect parasite (Hamilton et al., 2004) . Maximum dates were also applied to: (1) 100 MYA for the origin of the 'mammalian clade' (Hamilton et al., 2007) , based on the first major diversification of mammals (Bininda-Emonds et al., 2007) ; (2) 77 MYA for the origin of the 'avian clade' (Hamilton et al., 2007) ; based on diversification of passerine birds (Barker et al., 2004; Ericson et al., 2006) ; and (3) 184 MYA for the origin of the crocodilian clade (Viola et al., 2009) , based on diversification of extant crocodiles (Janke et al., 2005) .

We suggest that movement of bats between the Old and New Worlds within the last $5 million years (MY), certainly since geographical isolation of the Old and New Worlds, is the most likely explanation for the observed distribution of these trypanosomes. Of course, movement may also have been considerably more recent, but this is difficult to determine, as other calibration points are not available. We infer that migrant bats passed on their trypanosomes to native bat species, although the migrant bats themselves may not have established viable populations. The phylogenetic resolution provides insufficient evidence to determine whether movement occurred from Old World to New World or visa versa. Neither can the route of movement be inferred, as the wider distribution of these strains in either the Old or the New Worlds is currently unknown. Furthermore, although T. dionisii is a parasite specific to bats, a lack of specificity to particular species of bat host could be a critical factor in facilitating the spread of T. dionisii strains within continents. Trypanosoma (Schizotrypanum) sp. has been reported from $70 species and in all continents in which bats are found (Hoare, 1972) , but molecular studies would be required to determine the true distribution of species and strains.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1302, "end": 1315, "text": "(Hoare, 1972)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The most likely explanation for the presence of T. dionisii B in the New and Old Worlds is movement of an infected bat. Although T. dionisii can enter cells (Baker, 1985; Oliveira et al., 2009) and forms cysts in the muscular tissue of the heart (Gardner and Molyneux, 1988a) , suggesting pathogenicity, British bats have been shown to live for over a year with T. (Schizotrypanum) sp. (Gardner and Molyneux, 1988a) with no obvious detrimental effects. Thus, bats are probably capable of normal flying and movement (including some long-distance flights) while infected. Movement of T. dionisii by birds is an unlikely explanation, since it falls in the T. cruzi clade that is only known in mammals (Stevens et al., 1999; Hamilton et al., 2007) . Movement by the invertebrate vector in the absence of a vertebrate host is also unlikely. Cimicid bugs (the Cimicidae, or bed and bat bugs) are the only known vectors of T. dionisii and also transmit several other bat trypanosome species (Gardner and Molyneux, 1988b; Hamilton et al., 2007) . Cimicid bugs are unable to fly; some species are associated with bat roosts where they associate with bats mostly during feeding, and then leave for substantial periods of time (Reinhardt and Siva-Jothy, 2007) . Movement by an arthropod vector on bird hosts is possible, as some cimicid species can feed on both birds and bats (Reinhardt and Siva-Jothy, 2007) , but this is an unlikely scenario as a bug would need to feed on an infected bat in one continent, transfer to a bird, migrate and then transfer to and infect a bat in the second continent. Additionally, the infection could not be maintained in generations of bugs feeding exclusively on birds, since birds are not known hosts of bat trypanosomes. The vectorial capacity of the other bug family that is parasitic on bats, Polyctenidae (polictenids, or ''bat bugs''), is unknown, but could not move in the absence of a bat host. These wingless bugs live exclusively and permanently on bat hosts and are found on certain microchiropteran bats in tropical and subtropical regions of both the Old and New Worlds; of these, each of the two bug subfamilies is exclusive to one or other region, with no overlap between the Old and New Worlds. Moreover, while polictenid bugs can be transmitted experimentally between bats (Dick et al., 2009) , bat-bird transmission has not been reported. This raises the question of whether movement(s) of the infected bat(s) occurred naturally or was facilitated by humans. Constantine (2003) cited several reports of bats which had been inadvertently transported by humans, for example, by bats roosting in airplanes or ships. Presumably, most human-assisted transportations go unreported and these are likely to have occurred with increasing frequency since the 1800s, when ships increased significantly in size and speed, together with increased volumes of trade. In support of this idea, trypanosome infections were found in Eptesicus and Myotis in this study; there are reports of long-distance translocations of members of these genera that were mediated by humans, likely because these bats occasionally roost in ships (Constantine, 2003) . However it seems that two separate introductions would have been required to produce the two distinct T. dionisii B genotypes we have identified within the UK. The gGAPDH genes of these strains differed by 4 bp, and there is even greater divergence between some of the South American T. dionisii strains. While it is difficult to date how recently this divergence occurred, it seems unlikely that such divergence could have occurred since any human-mediated introduction of their bat hosts. Trypanosoma vivax was introduced into Latin America in cattle imported from Africa, possibly in the late 19th century (Jones and Davila, 2001 ), yet gGAPDH sequences of South American and West African T. vivax are identical (Adams et al., 2010) . Thus, natural movement of bats seems a more likely explanation, as this would provide sufficient time for either T. dionisii divergence within the Old or New Worlds and/or multiple introductions to occur.
