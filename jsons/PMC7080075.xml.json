On 11 February 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses referred to a new coronavirus capable of infecting humans as SARS-CoV-2 [3]. On the same day, the World Health Organization announced that the official name of the disease caused by this virus is COVID-19 [4]. As of 4 March 2020, there were 93,094 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 77 countries, with 80,422 in China [5]. According to recently published literature, similar to previously reported coronavirus infections, the typical radiographic image of pulmonary involvement in COVID-19 is parenchymal destruction expressed as ground-glass opacities and consolidation [6]. It has been reported that the susceptible population to the virus is mainly older adults with low immunity, and there have been few reports of paediatric patients [7]. Our objective was to present preliminary findings of abnormalities at chest CT in children with proven COVID-19.",

However, CT can be diagnostically helpful because current laboratory tests are time-consuming, sometimes return false-negative results, and do not always keep up with the needs of a growing number of infected people. Previous radiologic studies have shown that adults with COVID-19 infection have CT features of ground-glass opacities and consolidation, typically with peripheral distribution, and bilateral multifocal lower-lobe predominance [8]. Our observations were similar, but in our small cohort the CT findings were very modest.",
