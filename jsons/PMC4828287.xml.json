In lymphoid organs CXCL13 is expressed in B cell follicles and contributes to germinal center (GC) formation by recruiting activated B and follicular helper CD4+ T (TFH) cells expressing its cognate receptor CXCR5 (Victora and Nussenzweig, 2012, Zotos and Tarlinton, 2012, Crotty, 2012). Formation of GC by coordinated chemokine engagement of CD4+ T cells and activated B cells in turn is critical for B cell differentiation, isotype switching and affinity maturation leading to antibody secreting cells (ASC) or memory B cells (B\nmem) not secreting antibody (Ab). Both ASC and B\nmem surviving selection in GCs exit and provide long-lived humoral immunity following infection or vaccination. While ASC comprise long-lived plasma cells and their precursor plasma blasts, B\nmem require antigen or innate re-stimulation to differentiate into ASC.",

            "text": "CXCL13 is also associated with lymphoid neogenesis and propagation of humoral responses in non-lymphoid tissue during chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, Helicobacter pylori gastritis, multiple sclerosis (MS) and primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma (Wengner et al., 2007, Finch et al., 2013, Rubenstein et al., 2013, Winter et al., 2010, Fischer et al., 2009). In MS patients, CXCL13 is elevated in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), and detected in meningeal ectopic follicle-like structures as well as active plaques (Krumbholz et al., 2006, Haas et al., 2011, Corcione et al., 2005, Ragheb et al., 2011). Furthermore, the majority of CSF B cells from MS patients are CXCR5+ na\u00efve B cells or B\nmem (Krumbholz et al., 2006, Haas et al., 2011, Cepok et al., 2006, Corcione et al., 2004) supporting a link between elevated intrathecal CXCL13 and the accumulation of class-switched B\nmem (Haas et al., 2011). CXCL13 and B cells in the CSF are also hallmarks of individuals with Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) (Kowarik et al., 2012). In addition, high CXCL13 expression during primary CNS lymphomas, which are predominantly of B cell origin, is associated with inferior outcome as indicated by 10-fold higher CXCL13 levels in the CSF of patients with relapsed primary CNS lymphoma (Rubenstein et al., 2013). While the correlation between CXCL13 and B cell numbers in the CSF in both LNB and MS patients (Krumbholz et al., 2006, Kowarik et al., 2012, Rupprecht et al., 2009) supports a causal role for CXCL13 in B cell recruitment to the inflamed CNS, it remains to be formally demonstrated.",

            "text": "Blockade of CXCL13 in animal models of CNS inflammation has yielded mixed results. Mice with chronic-relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS, revealed B cell aggregation proximal to CXCL13 expression in the inflamed meninges (Magliozzi et al., 2004). Moreover, formation of meningeal ectopic follicles and expression of CXCL13 was suppressed by treatment with lymphotoxin-\u03b2 receptor-Ig fusion protein to disrupt lymphoid organ organization (Columba-Cabezas et al., 2006). By contrast, CXCL13 deficiency did not impair initial B cell recruitment to the CNS in a chronic, non-relapsing EAE model; however, potential effects during peak and chronic disease were not reported as B cell accumulation was only monitored at day 14 post-immunization (Rainey-Barger et al., 2011). B cell accumulation and CXCL13 expression, independent of CNS ectopic follicle-like structures, is also a feature of Sindbis virus infection. However, in this model B cell recruitment to the infected CNS was CXCL13 independent (Rainey-Barger et al., 2011), consistent with only a minor (\u223c1%) fraction of B cells in the CNS expressing CXCR5 (Metcalf et al., 2013). CNS infection by sublethal glia-tropic JHMV is also associated with CXCL13 upregulation and accumulation of heterogeneous B cell subsets (Phares et al., 2014). ASC accumulation within the CNS is CXCR3-dependent (Marques et al., 2011). Moreover, CXCL13 as a potential mediator of early B cell recruitment is supported by substantially higher expression of CXCR5 transcripts by CNS-infiltrating na\u00efve/early-activated B cells and B\nmem relative to ASC (Phares et al., 2014). Together these data indicate that local humoral responses within the CNS correlate with but are not necessarily dependent on CXCL13.",

            "text": "The present study sought to define how CXCL13 affects accumulation of distinct B cell subsets during JHMV infection. Following intracranial infection of adult mice JHMV initially replicates in ependymal cells that line the brain ventricles (Wang et al., 1992, Bergmann et al., 2006). Virus then spreads to the parenchyma, where infection is limited to focal areas throughout the brain, but largely sparing the brain stem. Glia are primary targets of infection with sparse neuronal involvement. Early during infection virus replicates prominently in glia and infiltrating macrophages. Once spreading down the central canal of the spinal cord, JHMV moves out into the white matter primarily infecting oligodendrocytes. Virus replication peaks at \u223c5 days post infection (p.i.), and is largely controlled by T cells within 2 weeks p.i. Nevertheless, although infectious virus remains undetectable after 2 weeks, virus persists at low levels as detected by mRNA expression in spinal cords for up to a year (Bergmann et al., 2006, Adami et al., 1995). Importantly, ASC within the CNS are essential to prevent viral reemergence (Ramakrishna et al., 2003, Tschen et al., 2002, Tschen et al., 2006).",

However, the absence of CXCL13 lead to diminished isotype-switched B\nmem as well as ASC accumulation during persistence, consistent with severely impaired GC B cell and TFH cell activation in cervical lymph nodes (CLN). Although ASC expansion in CLN was also negatively affected, there were no evident defects in antiviral serum Ab or ASC recruitment to the bone marrow (BM) in infected CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 relative to wild-type (WT) mice. The results suggest that migration of na\u00efve/early-activated B cells to the CNS is independent of CXCL13 driven signals in the priming lymph nodes or the CNS effector site. Moreover, despite reduced B cell differentiation in the absence of CXCL13, residual humoral immunity is sufficient to establish protective responses in the serum as well as CNS.",

While ASC accumulation is CXCR3:CXCL10 dependent (Marques et al., 2011, Phares et al., 2013), chemokines mediating CNS recruitment of other B cell subsets are unknown. CXCL13 dependent accumulation of na\u00efve/early-activated B cells (CD138\u2212IgD+IgM+) and B\nmem (CD138\u2212IgD\u2212IgM+/\u2212) is supported by higher CXCR5 transcript expression in both populations relative to CNS-derived CD138+ ASC (Fig.2\nA). CNS accumulation of na\u00efve/early-activated B cells, B\nmem, as well as ASC in infected WT and CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 mice was thus assessed by flow cytometry (Fig.2B\u2013E). Fig.2B shows a representative plot defining CD138\u2212IgD+IgM+ na\u00efve/early-activated B cells and CD138\u2212IgD\u2212IgM+/\u2212\nB\nmem. Although analysis focused on the spinal cord as the target of viral persistence and sustained CXCL13 levels, results were overall similar in the brain (data not shown). Total CD19+ B cell numbers were independent of CXCL13, regardless of the day p.i. (data not shown). The number of na\u00efve/early-activated B cells, comprising the vast majority of B cells at day 7 p.i. but declining thereafter (Phares et al., 2014), were also comparable between WT and CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 mice throughout infection (Fig.2C). B\nmem numbers were similar at day 7 p.i. in both groups; however, while they nearly doubled in WT mice between day 7 and day 14 p.i. B\nmem did not increase in the absence of CXCL13 (Fig.2D). By day 21 p.i. B\nmem numbers were comparable in both groups due to their decline in WT mice. Initial CD138+ ASC accumulation at day 14 p.i. was similar and increased by day 21 p.i. in both groups, but only reached \u223c50% of the levels in WT mice in absence of CXCL13 (Fig.2E). Furthermore, the number of CD138+ ASC still remained lower in infected CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 versus WT mice at day 42 p.i. (CXCL13\u2212/\u2212\n = 195 versus WT = 425). ELISPOT analysis of brain- and spinal cord-derived ASC was performed at day 21 p.i. to reveal whether impaired accumulation was restricted to virus-specific ASC and/or a specific Ig isotype. The number of total and virus-specific IgM+ ASC were similar in the CNS of WT and CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig.3\nA and B). However, the absence of CXCL13 resulted in 2- to 3-fold lower total and virus-specific IgG+ ASC in brains and spinal cords, respectively (Fig.3C and D). These data argue that CXCL13 is dispensable for early accumulation of na\u00efve/early-activated B cell in the CNS, but promotes both B\nmem and specifically IgG+ ASC accumulation as the na\u00efve/early-activated B cell population declines.",

            "text": "Generation of T dependent isotype-switched ASC and B\nmem following infections or immunizations is driven by antigen-specific B cell and CD4+ TFH engagement within GC (Victora and Nussenzweig, 2012, Zotos and Tarlinton, 2012). CXCR5 expressed on both activated B and CD4+ TFH cells promotes antigen-specific B cell expansion and enhances GC formation especially under conditions of limiting antigen load (Junt et al., 2005). Reduced IgG+ ASC accumulation in the CNS of JHMV infected CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 mice thus suggested a defect in peripheral expansion due to impaired GC formation. Following JHMV infection both T and B cell activation occurs primarily in CLN. Although CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 and CXCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice have developmental defects in the formation of most lymph nodes (Ansel et al., 2000, Forster et al., 1996), CLN and mesenteric LN are not disrupted in CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 mice (Ansel et al., 2000). This was confirmed by similar CLN cellularity in na\u00efve WT and CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 mice (data not shown). B cell activation in the draining CLN following infection was therefore monitored for GL7+CD95+ B cells by flow cytometry. GL7, also known as T and B cell activation marker and CD95, also known as FAS receptor are phenotypic markers of activated GC B cells (van Eijk et al., 2001, Cervenak et al., 2001). Frequencies of GC-derived B cells (CD19+GL7+CD95+) were already increased at day 7 p.i. in both infected WT and CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 mice relative to na\u00efve controls (Fig.4\nA). However, whereas GC B cells increased and remained elevated through day 21 p.i in WT mice, they failed to increase in CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig.4A). Impaired GC formation was supported by significantly reduced upregulation of transcript levels encoding AID, an enzyme upregulated in activated GC-derived B cells (Keim et al., 2013, Maul and Gearhart, 2010, Muramatsu et al., 2000), in CLN of CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 relative to WT mice (Fig.4B). By contrast, transcripts for CXCL12, CCL19, and CCL21, chemokines regulating B cell migration within lymph node follicles (Cyster, 2005, Okada and Cyster, 2006), were not impaired by CXCL13 deficiency (Fig.4C). CXCL12 mRNA levels remained at similar and constant levels throughout infection, while CCL19 and CCL21 mRNA levels were even significantly elevated after day 7 p.i. in the absence of CXCL13 (Fig.4C), potentially altering trafficking of CCR7+ lymphocytes or dendritic cells (Craft, 2012, Scandella et al., 2007). In contrast to GC-phenotype B cells, expansion of early short-lived CD138+ ASC prior to day 10 p.i. was CXCL13 independent (data not shown).",

            "text": "To assess whether impaired B cell activation in CLN coincided with reduced T cell help, TFH cells (CD4+CXCR5+PD-1hi) were compared between the groups. TFH frequencies were significantly increased relative to na\u00efve levels by day 7 p.i. in both WT and CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 mice and remained elevated through day 21 p.i. (Fig.4D). However, percentages were consistently lower in the absence of CXCL13 (Fig.4D). IL-21 is a TFH-derived cytokine that promotes GC reactions and generation of ASC (Zotos et al., 2010, Ozaki et al., 2002, Rankin et al., 2011, Linterman et al., 2010). Decreased expression of IL-21 transcripts in CLN mRNA from CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 mice supported impaired TFH activity (Fig.4E). Of note, similar CLN frequencies of virus-specific CD8+ T cells and CD4+CD25+ T cells in WT and CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 mice (data not shown) imply CXCL13 deficiency specifically affects TFH cells. To confirm impaired GC B cell and TFH cell activation in CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 mice coincides with poor GC development CLN were screened for discrete areas of T cell (CD3+) and B cell (B220+GL7+) co-localization as readout for GC formation. While GC were readily detected by day 14 p.i. (data not shown) and continued to mature through day 21 p.i. in WT mice, both the number and size of GC were noticeably smaller in CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 5\n). Impaired GC formation thus suggested reduced peripheral humoral responses are responsible for decreased CNS accumulation of IgG+ ASC. Surprisingly however, no differences in either virus-specific IgG or neutralizing Ab were detected in serum between WT and CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig.6\nA). To assess whether ASC matured independent of GC, virus-specific ASC were monitored in CLN and BM, the preferential site for long-term retention of protective ASC (Cyster, 2003). The frequency of virus-specific IgG ASC in CLN were only marginally reduced in the absence of CXCL13 at day 21 p.i., despite limited GC formation (Fig.6B). Furthermore, IgG+ ASC frequencies in BM were similar or slightly higher in CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 relative to WT mice (Fig.6C), consistent with intact serum Ab. Taken together the data indicate that CXCL13-dependent organized GC are not essential for mounting effective serum Ab responses following CNS infection. Moreover, although slightly impaired peripheral expansion coincided with reduced ASC accumulation in the CNS of CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 mice, ASC in BM were intact. These results suggested CXCR4 driven ASC recruitment to BM is not affected by CXCL13 deficiency, whereas reduced activation in CLN limits CXCR3 dependent accumulation to the inflamed CNS.",

To assess whether diminished ASC accumulation in the CNS of CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 mice altered JHMV pathogenesis, viral control was examined by monitoring infectious virus and transcripts encoding the viral nucleocapsid protein. Overall onset, progression and peak of clinical disease were comparable in WT and CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig.7\nA). Infectious virus was similar in both groups at day 5 and controlled with similar kinetics by day 14 p.i. (Fig.7B). By day 21 p.i. infectious virus was below detection in both groups with the exception of a single CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 mouse. Importantly, infectious virus remained undetectable through day 42 p.i. (Fig.7B). Similarly low persisting viral transcripts in the spinal cord of both groups further demonstrated ongoing viral control (Fig.7C). No alterations in antiviral T cell-mediated immunity in the absence of CXCL13 was supported by comparable spinal cord-derived transcripts for T cell-derived cytokines including IFN-\u03b3, IL-10 and IL-21 between WT and CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig.7D\u2013F). Notably, there were also no differences in CXCL9 or CXCL10 mRNA levels, suggesting signals for CXCR3 dependent ASC recruitment were not impaired (data not shown). Expression of transcripts encoding chemokines CXCL12, CCL19 and CCL21, potentially affecting recruitment of CXCR4 or CCR7 expressing B cells were also intact in CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig.7G\u2013I). Although CCL21 mRNA was not induced by infection in either group, CCL21 transcripts were 10-fold higher at basal levels and throughout infection in CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 relative to WT mice (Fig.7I). Notably, cytokine and chemokine expression profiles were similar in the brain (data not shown). These results indicate that control of persistence by the CNS humoral response is independent of CXCL13 despite the diminished number of isotype-switched virus-specific ASC.",

CXCL13 independent recruitment of early B cells was also noted following both Sindbis virus infection and induction of EAE (Rainey-Barger et al., 2011), supporting the notion that CXCL13 is not an effective target to manipulate B cell recruitment early during CNS inflammation. Moreover, during Sindbis virus infection CCL19 transcripts are elevated early in the CNS coinciding with peak numbers of CCR7+ B cells (Metcalf et al., 2013).",

CXCL13 recruits activated CXCR5+ TFH cells into the GC where IL-21, the signature TFH cytokine, promotes ASC and B\nmem differentiation (Ozaki et al., 2002, Rankin et al., 2011, Linterman et al., 2010, Rasheed et al., 2013). Impaired TFH activation, coincident with reduced IL-21 mRNA in CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 CLN, implied that reduced isotype-switched B cell accumulation in the CNS was predominantly attributed to deficient peripheral B cell differentiation rather than local CNS defects. Indeed, CNS-derived IL-21 transcripts, expressed primarily by CD4+ T cells during JHMV infection (Phares et al., 2013), were not altered by CXCL13 deficiency. Thus, although inflamed sites expressing CXCL13 may recruit circulating CXCR5+ TFH cells and thereby promote local B cell differentiation, CXCL13 independent IL-21 mRNA levels in the CNS argue against a local role of TFH cells in gliatropic JHMV infection. Furthermore, preliminary analysis shows no evidence for a CXCR5+ TFH phenotype in the CNS of JHMV-infected mice. Hence although CXCL13 driven CXCR5+ T cells are implicated in prolonging pathology during EAE (Bagaeva et al., 2006), our data suggest IL-21 expressing CD4 T cells in the JHMV-infected CNS are not regulated by CXCL13 and may comprise a distinct effector CD4 T cell subset. In this context it is of interest to note that IL-21 can be secreted by multiple CD4 T cell subsets (Yi et al., 2010).",

Similar results following CNS Sindbis virus infection (Rainey-Barger et al., 2011) imply that well organized follicles with clearly defined GC structures are not essential for effective peripheral antiviral humoral responses. Although GC formation was impaired in JHMV-infected CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 CLN, there was evidence for focal clustering of B and T cells at the time of GC formation in WT mice. Such focal sites of T and B cell aggregation may be supported by elevated expression of the CCR7 ligands CCL19 and CCL21 at days 14 and 21 p.i. in CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 relative to WT mice. CCR7 is increased on antigen engaged WT B cells, directing early-activated B cells to migrate to the T cell zone chemokines CCL19 and CCL21 (Reif et al., 2002). During peripheral Vesicular Stomatitis virus infection CCR7 plays a critical role in driving B:T helper cell collaboration at the T:B cell border (Scandella et al., 2007). Similarly, CCR7 enhanced interactions of antigen primed B cells and T helper cells may facilitate B cell differentiation during JHMV infection in absence of CXCL13. This is supported by only slightly reduced numbers of virus-specific IgG+ ASC in CLN and no ASC defects in BM of CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 relative to WT mice.",

In addition to distinct expression and regulation of various receptors on CNS-derived activated IgD+ B cells versus B\nmem in infected WT mice (Phares et al., 2014), impaired GC formation in absence of CXCL13 may further skew signaling by other chemokines acting via CXCR4 or CCR7. The extensive downregulation of both CXCR5 and CXCR4, but to a lesser extent CCR7, on CNS-derived WT B\nmem versus activated IgD+ B cells (Phares et al., 2014) suggests B\nmem are recruited by CXCR5:CXCL13 independent mechanisms and should thus not be affected by CXCL13 deficiency. However, it cannot be excluded that impaired GC formation alters imprinting of signals required for early B\nmem egress from lymphoid tissue into the circulation, thereby explaining the difference to WT mice at day 14 p.i. Distinguishing between CXCL13 dependent B\nmem egress into circulation, migration or survival in the CNS will be pursued in future studies.",

However, comparative analysis of distinct peripheral infections and protein immunization demonstrated that CXCR5 is particularly critical to augment humoral responses under conditions of low antigenic load (Junt et al., 2005). The overall efficient CXCL13 independent, albeit CD4 T cell dependent (Phares et al., 2012), virus-specific ASC responses following JHMV infection were thus surprising given poor peripheral replication of JHMV following intracranial infection. However, the present data do not exclude the possibility of protective extrafollicular responses in absence of CXCL13, especially if CD4 T cell help can be provided despite perturbed follicular structure. B cell activation and GC formation following JHMV infection is limited to the draining CLN, with little ASC expansion noted in the spleen (Marques et al., 2011). To what extent either cell free or dendritic cell-associated viral antigen drainage gives rise to effective humoral immunity remains to be resolved. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that GC formation is CXCL13 driven; however, CLN GC reactions are not essential to initiate isotype-switching under conditions of low viral load. Furthermore, similar frequencies of IgG+ virus-specific ASC in BM of CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 and WT mice suggest CXCR4 driven migration to BM is independent of imprinting in fully formed GC. Interestingly however, reduced accumulation of ASC in the CXCL13\u2212/\u2212 CNS suggests less efficient CXCR3 driven migration to inflamed sites. In WT mice, CXCR3 expression on CLN-derived ASC is increased between day 7 and 14 p.i. (Marques et al., 2011), coincident with initiation of GC formation. Altered chemokine receptor regulation on virus-specific IgG+ ASC in absence of CXCL13 may thus lead to preferential default migration to BM. Additionally, less organized B cell structures may impose distinct patterns of migration within lymph nodes, thereby affecting CLN egress into the circulation.",

These data suggest CXCL13 may not be a driving force in the seeding of B cell aggregates or follicle-like structures in non-lymphoid organs, which are thought to aggravate local autoimmunity (Finch et al., 2013, Parker Harp et al., 2015). Importantly, GC independent differentiation of antigen-specific B cells in lymphoid tissue implies similar events may occur at inflammatory sites characterized by elevated CCR7 ligand expression to promote B:T helper cell interactions.
