            "text": "Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), swine vesicular disease (SVD), and vesicular stomatitis (VS) are serious vesicular diseases that have devastated swine populations throughout the world. FMD, caused by FMD virus (FMDV; genus Aphthovirus, family Picornaviridae) (Clavijo et al., 2004a, Perkins et al., 2007a, Perkins et al., 2007b, World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), 2012, Oem et al., 2009), is one of the most contagious diseases in cloven-hoofed animals. Species susceptible to FMDV include swine, sheep, goats, and many wild ruminants. In 1997, a devastating FMD outbreak caused by O/TW/97 strain occurred in Taiwan and resulted in severe economic losses. The FMDV strain shows a porcinophilic phenotype with a deleted non-structural protein 3A gene (Yang et al., 1999, Beard and Mason, 2000). Another strain O/TW/99, having a full-length 3A coding region, was isolated from subclinically infected cattle in 1999 (Huang et al., 2002). SVD is caused by SVD virus (SVDV; genus Enterovirus, family Picornaviridae) (OIE, 2008). VS, affecting horses, cattle, and pigs, is caused by VS virus (VSV; genus Vesiculovirus, family Rhabdoviridae) (OIE, 2010). These diseases are clinically indistinguishable from FMD. To diagnose them correctly, advanced laboratory techniques are therefore required to detect and differentiate antibodies to these different viruses.",

            "text": "When susceptible host animals are infected with FMDV, antibodies against both viral structural proteins (SPs) and non-structural proteins (NSPs) are elicited. In contrast, animals administered with inactivated FMD vaccines that contain no or only trace amounts of NSPs are unlikely to induce NSP antibodies. Therefore, for FMD diagnosis, the NSP antibodies can be used as a marker to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals. Detecting NSP antibodies has an additional advantage that they are serotype independent, because the NSPs are predominantly conserved between serotypes of FMDV (Clavijo et al., 2004b). Currently, many methods for detecting NSP antibodies have been used, including agar gel immunodiffusion (O'Donnell et al., 1997), latex bead agglutination test (Sugimura et al., 2000), enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot (Bergmann et al., 1993, Bergmann et al., 2000, Bronsvoort et al., 2006), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (De Diego et al., 1997, O'Donnell et al., 1997, S\u00f8rensen et al., 1998, S\u00f8rensen et al., 2005, Shen et al., 1999, Chen et al., 2011), and chromatographic strip assay (Chen et al., 2009).",

More recently, two types of high-level multi-analyte profiling (xMAP) and high-throughput diagnostic methods using microspot arrays and bead arrays have been successfully developed to complement single-analyte assays. Antibodies and antigens are directly or indirectly coupled to fluorescent microspheres composed of a variety of materials, such as latex, polystyrene, polyacrylamide, and glass. Luminex liquid array technology is one of the detection systems, and it employs microspheres with carboxyl, amine/hydrazide, and maleimide groups on their surfaces to which the molecules such as antibodies, proteins, oligonucleotides, polysaccharides, lipids, or small peptides can bind the microspheres and be subsequently measured by a fluorochrome-conjugated detection molecule. The platform enables simultaneous detection of numerous analytes in a single assay, and there are now many examples of the creative use of this technology (Kellar and Iannone, 2002, Clavijo et al., 2006, Perkins et al., 2006).",

The FMDV-3ABC antibody is a reliable indicator of FMDV infection for sero-epidemiological studies. Luminex offers advantages over this test such as sensitivity, specificity, simplicity, reliability, multiplexing capabilities, simultaneous quantitative determination, reducing the subjectivity, less time for data acquisition, time saving and reduced cost, statistical superiority, more flexibility, faster hybridization kinetic, greater accessibility to antibody, and no-wash assay (Clavijo et al., 2006, Dunbar, 2006, Oliver et al., 1998, Vignali, 2000). The assay is observed in some research, such as that for cytokines IL-2, -4, -6, -8, -10, -12; TNF-\u03b1; IFN-\u03b3; antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus, avian influenza virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, and Rubella and Toxoplasma; soluble hepatitis B virus surface antigen in serum; and nucleic acid detection for single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping, genetic disease screening, gene expression profiling, infectious disease including HIV, SARS-CoV, hepatitis C virus, herpes simplex virus, HLA DNA typing, microbial detection, and other biomolecules (Watson et al., 2009, Willman et al., 2001, Kellar and Iannone, 2002, Dunbar, 2006, Lenhoff et al., 2008). In this study, a Luminex assay based on 3ABC NSP of FMDV serotype O was developed to test serum antibody against FMDV-3ABC in swine. Through the study, an ideal cutoff value of the assay was determined (Fig. 2), early detection was validated (Fig. 3), and high specificity and sensitivity were demonstrated (Fig. 4, Fig. 5, and Table 2).",

Potentially up to 100 different analyses can be performed simultaneously, thereby providing a high-throughput platform. It is also conducive to automation, employing high throughput, liquid-handling robotic platforms that minimize human resources required for running routine screening (Dunbar, 2006, Perkins et al., 2006, Perkins et al., 2007b). It has been reported that the analytical sensitivity of a Luminex assay can achieve as low as \u2266 1 pg/ml with high-titer antibodies (Kellar et al., 2006). High-affinity cytokine antibody in combination with liquid-phase kinetics and the high binding capacity of three-dimensional microspheres produce a robust multiplexed immunoassay with a detection limit of these assays extending over three to four logs, as compared with one to two logs for ELISAs (Kellar and Iannone, 2002). In our single-signature Luminex assay, it is expected that similar results were obtained. The analytical sensitivities of the chromatographic strip assay, sandwich ELISA, and the newly developed Luminex assay were 10,000, and 10 and 100 times higher than that of the commercial 3ABC blocking ELISA kit (diluted 10\u2212 1 fold), respectively (Chen et al., 2011). This revealed that the chromatographic strip assay could rapidly accomplish the detection of NSP antibodies and was more suitably applied to clinical diagnosis. However, the Luminex and ELISAs could detect a larger number of samples at a time in a laboratory when used by skilled personnel.",

To compare the relative sensitivities of NSP antibody assays, our laboratory generated a swine serum panel composed of 320 samples. The experimentally infected pigs at 8 dpi still had positive reactions of 80% and remained positive up to 34 dpi. The results indicate the peaks of positive ratios appeared on 14 dpi and 21 dpi, respectively (Fig. 3a and b). Three positive reactors were obtained on 0 and 6 dpi in samples from the same experimentally infected pigs. These positive reactors tested negative by the virus neutralization test and the ELISAs, suggesting that these were false positive results. However, three of the six methods, the Luminex assay, sandwich ELISA, and the 3ABC blocking ELISA kit showed earliest detection of NSP antibody in sequential serum samples on 8 dpi and gave positive ratios of 78%, 75%, and 66%, respectively. This is in agreement with most authors that report the appearance of specific antibodies by 7 dpi (Clavijo et al., 2006) or 8 dpi (Bergmann et al., 2003, Chen et al., 2009, Chen et al., 2011). In contrast, on the same time point the positive ratios given by the chromatographic strip assay and 3B indirect ELISA were less than 50%. The inconsistency could be due to some differences in conformation of proteins generated by different expression systems, thus suggesting that the ELISA platforms have a good capacity of detecting a small amount of antibodies in samples and are a suitable selection of serological mass screening. In fact, the 3ABC indirect ELISA can detect FMDV-infected pigs only on 14 dpi and later whereas the other ELISA assays showed high rates of positivity and earlier detection (Fig. 3a). Thus, the performances of these ELISA assays are assay-dependent. The Luminex assay also detected remarkable NSP antibody responses by 14 dpi in experimentally infected pigs, consistent with the results from the sandwich ELISA, 3ABC blocking ELISA kits, and 3B peptide indirect ELISA. It indicated the performance parameters of the Luminex assay and the good correlation with the ELISA recommend that we validate the Luminex assay for analyzing FMDV-NSP recombinant protein profiles in immunodiagnostic reagent studies in vitro (Fig. 3a). There are similar other immunoassay technologies as Luminex and blocking ELISA and indirect ELISA where the reagents are critically important (Shen et al., 1999, S\u00f8rensen et al., 1998, S\u00f8rensen et al., 2005, Chen et al., 2011, Clavijo et al., 2006, Codorean et al., 2010). Currently, collaborative efforts are underway to fully optimize and validate this Luminex assay for mass screening and confirmation.",

The results showed that the Luminex assay using the 3ABC and anti-3ABC antibody derived from the FMDV O/TW/99 strain could detect antibodies induced by not only O/TW/99 but also O/TW/97 strains. The antibody detection for two out of the five showed the PI value under 50% for 42.9 and 41 as a negative reaction for the O/TW/99 strain antiserum by the 3ABC blocking ELISA. Indeed, both of these methods have distinct differences (Table 3).",

Finally, evaluation of testing results was adopted based on the cutoff value in the T/C ratio of 0.07.

Vaccination is one of the main methods that can be implemented to control FMD, and it is currently the primary control strategy used in Taiwan. With coverage through vaccination, highly sensitive methods are essential to discover virus activities, clinical and subclinical, in the field. In the present studies, we displayed 307 vaccinated pigs by the Luminex assay, and four vaccinated animals showed reactions over 1000 MFI (Fig. 4), three out of four of which were closer to the threshold less than 1500 MFI value. This can be due to the presence of low levels of NSP antibody or nonspecific reactions to contaminants in the antigens or maybe actually normal. That NSP antibody in all the 15 sera from vaccinated but unprotected pigs was able to be detected by the Luminex and the chromatographic strip. However, 11 out of the 15 sera were positive by the sandwich ELISA, and only 9 of the 15 sera were positive by the 3ABC blocking ELISA kit (Table 4). The results indicated that the former two methods were more sensitive, as confirmed by the clinical diagnosis, and worthy to be applied to the detection of NSP antibodies in vaccinated animals in the future. Thus, the Luminex developed here demonstrates the diagnostic application of recombinant FMDV NSP-3ABC in monitoring seroconversion following FMD vaccination.",
