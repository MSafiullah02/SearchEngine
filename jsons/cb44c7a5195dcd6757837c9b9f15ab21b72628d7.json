Serkedjieva et al. (1992) reported that the pretreatment of canine kidney epithelial (MDCK) cells with propolis had no effect on influenza virus replication. However, a reduced viral infectivity was seen adding propolis simultaneously with the virus or immediately after virus adsorption, suggesting that adsorption and the penetration of virus were inhibited in the initial stage of replication cycle. Ito et al. (2001) verified the efficient activity of propolis anti-HIV in vitro. Gekker et al.

Administration of propolis before or simultaneously to infection yielded the most significant inhibitory effect, suggesting that this effect were because of propolis blockage of the cell membrane receptors for HSV or because of changes inside the cells, which could in turn affect the virus replication cycle. Huleihel and Ishano (2001) and Matsuo et al. (2005) suggested that the antiviral activity of propolis might be attributed to flavonoids action, which play a significant role in the antiviral process.
