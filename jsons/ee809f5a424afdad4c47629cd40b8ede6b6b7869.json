            "text": "Although the COVID -19 virus (SARS-CoV-2) has not yet been detected in AGPs, care should be taken to reduce the risk of surgical staff infection in the operating room. In experimental conditions SARS-Cov-2 has recently been shown to have aerosol and fomite transmission potential similar to SARS-Cov-1 (the most closely related human virus), in particular remaining in aerosols for 3 hours or more and on surfaces for up to 72 hours [4] . In anticipation of a substantial amount of operations in the near future of COVID -19 carriers and infected patients, a simple and effective measure for the evacuation and entrapment of smoke and aerosol is needed. Due to collapsing economies and limited availability for appropriate filter equipment within this pandemic, we suggest the use of a simple, very low-cost filtration system with readily available components in the operating room for immediate implementation. Standard electrostatic filters used for ventilation machines have the capability of filtering known bacterial and viral loads with great efficiency [5] and most are certified for 99.99% effective protection against HBV and HCV which have a diameter of 42nm and 30-60 nm respectively [6] . SARS-CoV-2 has a larger diameter of 70-90 nm [7] therefore the same filtering efficiency can be expected to apply for new virus. This filter can be connected via standard tubing to the trocar evacuation port to constitute an evacuation and filtering system which evacuates the generated smoke, as well as filter the potential viral load to ensure surgical staff safety. In order to connect the filter to the tubing we use the endotracheal tube connector ( figure 1a, 1b) . No active suctioning is attached to this system.",

Findings and guidelines are quickly being published and frequently updated by relevant learned societies such as the American College of Surgery (ACS), the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES), and the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) [8] [9] [10] to update surgeons dealing with COVID-19. Although the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh published important guidance of surgical care to protect patients and surgeons [10] we disagree with the statement that laparoscopy should be avoided. Provided a simple, safe and reliable filtering and evacuation system for pneumoperitoneum gases is used, and that strict precautions are abided to, laparoscopy is potentially preferable to open surgery, where smoke contamination is uncontrollable. Suggestions such as instrument cleaning during surgery, deflating pneumoperitoneum prior to removing trocars, conversion or specimen extraction, as highlighted by the Chinese and Italian experience, are particularly helpful [1] .",
