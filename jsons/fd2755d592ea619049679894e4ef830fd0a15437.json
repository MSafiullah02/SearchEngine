Interestingly, both CD26 and the angiotensin system show associations with senescence. For example, ACE-2 is a known inhibitor of cell proliferation and the angiotensin system is upregulated in both premature and replicative senescence [5, 6] . Remarkably, CD26 is known to be a bonafide cell surface marker of senescent cells [7] . Similarly, myofibroblasts (which are considered to be senescent and pro-fibrotic cells) also over-express CD26 and ACE-2 [8, 9] . Senescent cells produce large amounts of inflammatory cytokines, as a result of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), including IL-6.",

Recent studies have shown that Azithromycin, and the closely related drug Roxithromycin, both act as senolytic drugs that can target and selectively remove senescent cells, with an efficiency of nearly 97% [16] . Interestingly, in patients with Cystic Fibrosis, Azithromycin is known to have an anti-fibrotic effect, which significantly extends their lifespan, by targeting myofibroblast cells (Discussed in Ref [16] ). Cystic Fibrosis patients normally die from lung inflammation and fibrosis, resulting in lung stiffening and an inability to respire. Fibrosis is also known to be an age-related phenomenon, associated with increased numbers of myofibroblasts (senescent cells), which increases with chronological age. Azithromycin functionally acts as an anti-inflammatory drug and reduces SASP mediators, such as IL-1beta and IL-6 [17, 18] . This may be due to Azithromycin's high senolytic activity and/or inhibition of protein synthesis.",

Briefly, in young mice (4-8 weeks-old), the SARS-CoV infection is cleared very rapidly, which is accompanied by mild pneumonitis, without the activation of cytokine production. In contrast, in older mice (12-14-months-old), productive infection with SARS-CoV led to a more severe interstitial pneumonitis, with alveolar damage, significant fibrosis and scarring, as well as severe activation of cytokine production, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, CCL-2, CCL-3, CXCL-10, and IFN-\u03b3 [32, 33] . This latter mouse model more closely resembles the SARS-CoV disease phenotype, observed in patients with advanced chronological age. Therefore, such a mouse model would also be useful for testing the efficacy of new therapies, specifically targeting the senescent cell Figure 1 . What is the relationship between COVID-19 and advanced chronological age? Here, we suggest that the COVID-19 corona virus preferentially targets senescent lung cells, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality in the aging population. One possible solution for prevention/treatment would be the use of senolytics or other anti-aging drugs. Testing this hypothesis will require the necessary clinical trials, with a focus on drug repurposing. AGING population and SASP, for the repurposing of these FDA-approved anti-aging drugs.",
