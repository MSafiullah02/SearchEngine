The Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry (ACLP) residency education subcommittee convened a writing group with the goal of summarizing the current evidence about outpatient consultation-liaison psychiatry (CLP) training and providing a framework for CLP educators who are interested in developing outpatient CLP rotations within their programs. Method: MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase and PsycINFO (via OVID), were reviewed each from inception to December 2019, for psychiatric CLP services in ambulatory settings that involved residents or fellows. The CLP education guidelines were reviewed for recommendations relevant to outpatient CLP. We also searched MedEd portal for published curriculums relevant to CLP. The group held 2 conferences to reach consensus about recommendations in setting up outpatient CLP rotations. Results: Seventeen articles, three ACLP supported guidelines, and eight online didactic resources were identified as directly reporting on the organization and/or impact of an outpatient CLP rotation. These manuscripts indicated that residents found outpatient CLP rotations effective and relevant to their future careers. However, the literature provided few recommendations for establishing formal outpatient CLP training experiences. Discussion: Outpatient CLP rotations offer multiple benefits for trainees, including exposure to specific clinical scenarios and therapeutic interventions applicable only in the outpatient setting, increased continuity of care and the unique experience of providing liaison and education to nonmental health providers. The article outlines recommendations and examples for developing outpatient CLP rotations which CLP educators can incorporate in their programs.",

Many of these clinics were \"medical-psychiatric\" or \"C-L\" clinics, where inpatients could be followed after discharge. The authors also presented a recently founded outpatient \"Medical Illness Clinic\" at their institution, describing the role of residents and fellows, clinical structure, supervision process and logistics of integrating the clinical experience into the residency curriculum (2) .",

These guidelines recommended that psychiatry residents be exposed to an ambulatory primary clinic, an outpatient specialty clinic, or an outpatient CLP clinic (3) . Updated ACLP (at that time 4 Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine [APM]) guidelines for training psychiatry residents in CLP in 2014 expanded upon the recommendation for an ambulatory experience, noting the valuable exposure to diverse patient populations and models of care, and the opportunity to design an outpatient integrated care experience to complement the inpatient CLP experience (4) .",

The ACGME established the requirement for a minimum 2-month long CLP experience for psychiatry residents in 1994, but has not provided specific recommendations about the setting or nature of this experience (6) . The CLP fellowship guidelines are the most inclusive and directive, noting that fellows must participate in continuity of patient care between acute general hospital and ambulatory care (6) . No further details are provided regarding the type of facility or duration of the rotation. The ACGME program requirements for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (CAP) fellows allow for the consultation experience to take place in \"outpatient and/or inpatient non-psychiatric medical facilities.\" (7) . Outpatient CLP training is not specifically mentioned in the Psychiatry or CLP Milestones, but many psychiatry training requirements can be met through outpatient CLP rotations. For example, the fellowship Milestone, \"MK3-Practice of psychosomatic medicine,\" requires fellows to demonstrate knowledge of consultation and collaborative care models (8) . By contrast, CAP fellows would need to provide \"integrated care for psychiatric patients and families through collaboration with physicians and other healthcare providers at communitybased sites\" in order to achieve a level 4 on the SBP4 milestone: \"Consultation to and integration with Non-psychiatric Medical Providers and Non-medical Systems\" (9). To address the need for outpatient CLP training in the view of expanded clinical demands, the ACLP residency education subcommittee formed a writing group with the goal to summarize the current evidence about outpatient CLP training and provide a framework for CLP educators who are interested in developing outpatient CLP rotations within their programs. For this discussion, \"outpatient CLP\" was defined as any practice of psychiatry in an outpatient medical, surgical or primary care setting. We included all models employed to provide outpatient CLP services: collaborative care 2 , co-located care 3 and integrated care 4 .",

A summary of five psychiatry training programs that provided integrated care training for residents found that the success of such programs depended on the presence of a supervising psychiatrist with experience in integrated care, funding for faculty time, time within the residency program, office space within the clinical site, and a clinic \"champion\" that supports integrated care (17) . Overall, residents responded positively to the various integrated care experiences and viewed them as effective and relevant in preparing them for their future careers (16) and enhancing their learning on how to assess and manage complex medical-psychiatric patients (18, 22) . Additional benefits of co-located and collaborative care models include increased primary care physician comfort with medication management, increased capacity to care for patients presenting with psychiatric problems and improved interprofessional communication and education (2, 17, 18, 22, 25) .",

In addition, patients routinely seen by CLP consultants in the hospital may present with different clinical challenges outside the hospital; the patient seen on the inpatient neurology service for lupus encephalitis may have presented earlier in the rheumatology clinic with depression. The outpatient CLP setting can provide exposure to unique clinical scenarios, such as screening for depression in healthy primary care patients, assessments for risk stratification prior to surgery, untreated psychosis refusing mental health care and not meeting criteria for commitment, and somatization disorders 9 or functional disorders that do not require hospitalization. The outpatient experience may provide exposure to psychiatric diagnoses more commonly seen in the outpatient setting, including mood, anxiety, adjustment disorders, and somatic symptom and related disorders (2) . An outpatient CLP rotation may also allow the psychiatrist to assist patients with chronic mental disorders as they cope with the demands of medical care for serious medical conditions (e.g. patients with schizophrenia undergoing chemotherapy or organ transplantation), a task that is difficult to accomplish from a separate mental health clinic. Psychiatric evaluations focused on risk stratification prior to surgeries (e.g. weight loss surgery) are often performed exclusively in the outpatient setting because they benefit from specialized knowledge of the course of these complex medical processes.",

The rotation also provides a rare opportunity for a true 360-degree evaluation, with nurses, social workers, administrative support staff, other physicians and even longitudinal patients as potential sources of feedback, especially around communication skills and professionalism. Didactics: Despite the expansion of clinical outpatient CLP services, there is a paucity of formal didactic curriculum that addresses relevant topics(Table 5).CONCLUSIONTraining in the outpatient CLP setting offers unique benefits to psychiatric trainees by allowing exposure to specific clinical scenarios, implementations of psychiatric interventions in the medically ill and unique liaison opportunities. Skills acquired in this setting are likely to be used in the practice of general psychiatry, not only in a medical clinic. There is a dire need for educational research that systematically evaluates the impact of outpatient CL rotations upon knowledge and practice skills, in order to determine the best teaching techniques in this setting.",

A review of an unpublished survey of program directors available on the ACLP website reveals that 100% of responding programs offer outpatient rotations, with some fellows spending the majority of their training year doing outpatient CLP work (10). Crude analysis of this data indicates that fellows spend an average of 10.6 hours per week on outpatient CLP work, as compared with 29.9 hours per week of inpatient CLP work (range 3-28 hours/week).",
