The dynamics consists of a Susceptible-Infected (SI) model based on the logarithmic Caputo fractional derivative. We find an approximate analytical solution for this model which represents an upper bound for the fractional SI dynamics on a network. This upper bound is expressed in terms of the Mittag-Leffler function of the adjacency matrix of the network of interamino acids interactions. We consider some network descriptors based on these Mittaf-Leffler matrix functions which account for the \"circulability\" and \"transmissibility\" of the perturbations across the residues of a protein.",

It could be argued that c Year Diogenes Co., Sofia pp. xxx-xxx the main function of such networks is that of allowing the communication between the entities that form its structure. In the case of proteins, the non-covalent interactions between residues in their three-dimensional structures form inter-residue networks [10, 17] . These networks facilitate that information about one site is transmitted to and influences the behavior of another. This phenomenon-the transmission of any perturbation in protein structure and function from one site to another-is known as allostery, which represents an essential feature of protein regulation and function [9, 20] . Allostery permits that two residues geometrically distant can interact with each other. As observed experimentally by Ottemann et al. [30] a conformational change of 1\u00c5 in a residue can be transmitted to another 100\u00c5 apart. As stated long-time ago, such allosteric effects can occur even when the average protein structure remains unaltered [8] . An important kind of allosteric effect is the transmission of the changes produced by a ligand interacting with a protein. Such transmission occurs from the residues proximal to the binding site to other residues distant from it. Such kind of allosteric interaction is very important for understanding the effects of drugs on their receptors, which directly impacts the drug design process [22] .",

            "text": "It has been stressed by Berry [7] that there are striking similarities between organization schemes at different observation scales in complex systems, such as allosteric-enzyme networks, cell population and virus spreading. Recently, Miotto et al. [27] exploited these similarities between epidemic spreading and a diffusive process on a protein residue network to prove the capability of propagating information in complex 3D protein 3 structures. Their analogy proved useful in estimating important protein properties ranging from thermal stability to the identification of functional sites [27] . In the current work, we go a step further in the exploitation of the analogy between epidemiological models and communication processes in proteins by considering the inclusion of long-range transmission effects. For this purpose, we develop here a new fractional logarithmic Susceptible-Infected (SI) model for the transmission of perturbations through the amino acids of a protein residue network. Such perturbations are produced, for instance, by the interactions of the given protein with inhibitors, such as drugs or drug candidates. We obtain an upper bound to its exact soluction of this fractional logarithmic SI model which is expressed in terms of the Mittag-Leffler matrix functions, and which generalizes the approximate solution found by Lee et al. [21] to the non-fractional (classical) SI model.",

            "text": "Due to its current relevance, we apply the present approach to the study of the long-range inter-residue communication in the main protease of the new coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 [33, 32] . This new coronavirus has produced an outbreak of pulmonary disease expanding from the city of Wuhan, Hubei province of China to the rest of the World in about 3 months [35] . One of the most important targets for the development of drugs against SARS-CoV-2 is its main protease, M pro , whose 3-dimensional structure has been recently resolved and deposited [34] in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [1] . It is a key enzyme for proteolytic processing of polyproteins in the virus and some chemicals have been found to bind this protein, representing potential specific drug canditades against CoV-2 [34] . Here we find that important communication between amino acids in CoV-2 M pro occurs from the proximities of the binding site to very distant amino acids in other domains of the protein. These effects produced by the interaction with inhibitors are transmistted up to 60\u00c5 away from the binding site, confirming the long-range nature of intra-protein communication. According to our results, it seems that stronger inhibitors transmit such perturbations to longer inter-residue distances. Therefore, the current findings are important for the understanding of the mechanisms of drug action on CoV-2 M pro , which may help to the design of drug candidates against this new coronavirus.",

At this stage, it has been shown [21] that the SI model is most suitable than any other model. To motivate the SI model in the PRN context let us consider that an amino acid is in the binding site of a protein. Then, this amino acid is susceptible to be perturbed by the interaction with this inhibitor. Consequently, this residue can be in one of two states, either waiting to be perturbed (susceptible) or being perturbed by the interaction. Of course, this amino acid can transmit this perturbation to any other amino acid in the protein to which it interacts with. Then, if \u03b2 is the rate at which such perturbation is transmitted between amino acids, and if s i ptq and x i ptq are the probabilities that the residue i is susceptible or get perturbed at time t, respectively, we can write the dynamics",

Therefore, the functions E 1{2,1 p\u03b6Aq and exp p\u03b6Aq counts the walks of any lengths from different pairs of residues in the protein, but the first penalizes such walks by the double factorial of its length and the second penalizes them by the single factorial. The double factorial growths more slowly than the single one, which means that the longer walks in E 1{2,1 p\u03b6Aq are less penalized than in exp p\u03b6Aq. In other words, the function E 1{2,1 p\u03b6Aq accounts for more long-range interactions between amino acids in a protein than the matrix exponential, which means that the fractional logarithmic SI model describes a longer-range process than the classical SI one.",

This means that in a normal diffusive process like the one when \u03b1 \" 1 a perturbation occurring at a given region of the protease is slowly transmitted to the rest of the residues in the protein. In contrast, when the diffusive process is of fractional nature, such transmission is almost instantaneous across the whole structure of the protein. Unfortunately, we do not have experimental facts that support one or the other mechanism at this time.",

We have selected the time at which 50% of the amino acids in the protease are perturbed, which occurs at t \" 6 for \u03b1 \" 1{2 and t \" 50 for \u03b1 \" 1. The rest of the parameters remain the same for both descriptors, i.e., \u03b2 \" 0.01, \u03b3 \" 1\u00b4c N , c \" 0.005. In Table 1 we give the values of the relative changes in both parameters expressed as percentage. The first interesting result is that when \u03b1 \" 1 the most significant changes in the protease structures bounded to inhibitors occurs in the neighborhood of the amino acids. That is the circulability of the perturbation around the residues, \u2206G \u03b1\"1 ii , is more than 300% larger in the bounded protease than in the free one. This contrast with what we observe for the transmissibility terms, \u2206G \u03b1\"1 ij , which, with the exception of 6Y2F, have less than 1/3 of variation than that of the circulability. These results contrast dramatically with those obtained for \u03b1 \" 1{2. In this case, the circulability is only about 60% larger in the bounded protease than in the free one. However, here the individual transmissibilities are about 300% higher in the bounded protease than in the free one. Here again 6Y2F is an exception with almost 700% of increment. We remind the reader that the structures 6Y2F and 6Y2G contain the same inhibitor and their difference is due to the different space group in which the structures are resolved [34] . The structure 6Y2F is in the same space group as the free protease, namely C2, where both protomers A and B have identical conformations. However, 6Y2G is in the space group P 2 1 2 1 2 1 , where the two protomers have different conformations. It was noticed by Zhang et al. [34] that in 6Y2G \"the key residue Glu166 adopts an inactive conformation in protomer B\" even though the inhibitor \"is bound in the same mode\" in both protomers. Therefore, we consider the hypothesis that the \"correct\" structure for the inhibitor studied by Zhang et al. is the one with the code 6Y2F and not the one with PDB code 6Y2G. The inhibitor studied by Zhang et al. [34] is a very potent one, with EC 50 of 0.67 \u03bcM. Notice that the inhibitor in 6LU7 has EC 50 25 times higher than that of 6Y2F. We should expect then that the effects of this potent inhibitor in 6Y2F are \"felt\" by very distant amino acids in CoV-2 M pro . This is exactly what is reflected by the values of \u2206G \u03b1\"1{2 ij . While the increase of this transmissibility in 6LU7 and 6W63 is more than 350% relative to the free protease, such increment is almost 700% in 6Y2F. In contrast, the relative increase of the transmissibility in 6Y2G is smaller than that in 6LU7 and 6W63.",

More importantly, our findings suggest that the length of this transmission seems to reflect the potency of the inhibitor. That is, the more powerful the inhibitor the longer the transmission of its effects through the protein. For instance, the very potent inhibitor O6K is able to transmit the perturbations from the binding site up to 45\u00c5 away from it as average. Other weaker inhibitors do not propagate such effect beyond 35\u00c5 from the binding site as average. Consequently, these findings are important for understanding the mechanisms of actions of such inhibitors on SARS CoV-2 M pro and helping in the design of more potent drug candidates against this new coronavirus. Of course, the current approach can be extended and used for the analysis of other inhibitors in other proteins not only using experimental data like in here but using computational analysis of such interactions.",
