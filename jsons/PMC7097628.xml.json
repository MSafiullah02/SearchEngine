            "text": "Whereas the morphology and the architecture of Flavivirus ROs are well-defined, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms governing the biogenesis of VPs and CMs. In the case of DENV, available evidence argues for a prominent role of the two small non-structural proteins NS4A and NS4B in the formation of ROs. Both proteins possess multiple transmembrane spanning \u03b1-helices and a single amphipathic \u03b1-helix that is partially embedded into the luminal leaflet of the ER8 (Figs 1a,2A). The lipid bilayer asymmetry that is produced by the \u03b1-helix insertion might act as a wedge and induce negative membrane curvature. Moreover, membrane bending might be increased by the formation of NS4A and NS4B homo-oligomers and hetero-oligomers23. However, the individual or combined expression of NS4A and NS4B outside the context of viral infection does not induce the formation of VPs, suggesting that the membrane remodelling functions of these proteins are not sufficient to phenocopy DENV ROs and that additional viral factors are required. Owing to its analogy to alphaviruses and the Flock House virus, viral RNA could be one candidate factor24,25,26.",

NS1 interacts with both NS4A and NS4B (Fig. 2A), and recombinant NS1 interacts with and remodels lipids in vitro27,28. NS2A is a small hydrophobic protein with five transmembrane \u03b1-helices that can alter membrane permeability29. In addition, NS2A is enriched in subcellular regions containing viral dsRNA and may interact with replicase proteins29. Together, these results support a model in which oligomers of NS4A and NS4B, and possibly NS2A, induce negative membrane curvature, with NS1 dimers present within the ER lumen promoting positive membrane curvature and assisting in the formation of invaginated vesicles (Fig. 2A, inset). Additionally, host factors such as components of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery appear to have a role in the formation of VPs, for example, by participating in the assembly of the vesicle pore30.",

Key contributors to its biogenesis are NS4B and NS5A16,31. The complex topology of NS4B, which is comprised of four transmembrane \u03b1-helices flanked by two amphipathic \u03b1-helices on either side (Fig. 1b), together with its oligomerization capabilities, may support and promote positive membrane curvature32. Moreover, essential residues for DMV formation and RNA replication have been identified within the NS4B carboxy-terminal domain33. Regarding NS5A, it is the only HCV protein able to induce DMVs16, a process that is facilitated by determinants that are located within the membrane-associated amino-terminal amphipathic \u03b1-helix of NS5A domain 1 (Ref. 31). Furthermore, NS5A recruits several host factors that are essential for membranous web formation34,35,36. Finally, NS5A inhibitors as well as antagonists of cyclophilin A, a chaperone that binds to NS5A, block membranous web formation, highlighting its essential role in the biogenesis of HCV ROs34,37.",

Genome-wide knockdown or knockout screens, together with transcriptomic and proteomic analyses conducted in both mosquito and mammalian cells, revealed the involvement of various components of the UPS in Flavivirus infection82 (Fig. 3B). For example, components of the ERAD pathway were identified in a recent CRISPR\u2013Cas9 knockout screen as essential factors for several flaviviruses48. For DENV infection, upregulation of UPS-related genes has been observed in both infected cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from infected individuals, arguing for the physiological relevance of the UPS in Flavivirus infection83. Moreover, the UPS or components thereof are required for efficient virus production in the mosquito midgut84, which is consistent with quantitative proteomic analyses of mosquito cells infected with ZIKV that show increased UPS protein levels85. Proteasome inhibitors MG132 and bortezomib exert antiviral activity against ZIKV and DENV in vitro and reduce viral load in an in vivo mouse model85,86. Collectively, these data indicate that both early and late events in the Flavivirus replication cycle require components of the UPS84,86,87,88. Although a strong dependence on the UPS was not observed for HCV infection48,89, several UPS components are required for efficient viral replication90. Interestingly, UPS components of relevance for HCV replication are also required for WNV and DENV replication90, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role in the replication cycles of members of Flaviviridae.",

            "text": "Autophagy. Autophagy is a catabolic process involving the formation of DMVs (autophagosomes) that engulf cytoplasmic content, cellular organelles, protein aggregates and pathogens for lysosomal degradation. Increased formation of autophagosomes and modulation of the autophagic flux has been consistently observed in DENV, ZIKV and HCV-infected cells100,101 (Fig. 3B). For flaviviruses, autophagy induction is mediated by NS4A for DENV and NS4A in addition to NS4B for ZIKV102,103,104 (Fig. 3B). In contrast to DENV, where NS4A-induced autophagy confers protection from cell death, ZIKV proteins dysregulate autophagy through AKT1\u2013mTOR (RAC-\u03b1 serine/threonine-protein kinase\u2013mechanistic target of rapamycin) inhibition, leading to increased cell death and altered neurogenesis in fetal neural stem cells. For DENV, infectious vesicles containing viral RNA and autophagy markers were detected in supernatants of infected cells and in patient sera, supporting a role for autophagy as an alternative viral transmission route105. For both flaviviruses and HCV, viral proteins and RNA were found to colocalize with autophagosomes, suggesting that viral ROs associate with autophagic membranes106,107. Whereas the ER origin of flavivirus ROs refutes this hypothesis, an involvement of autophagic factors in the formation of the HCV-induced membranous web was recently reported9,108. This study showed that the autophagosome membrane elongation complex ATG5\u2013ATG12\u2013ATG16L1 was recruited to the membranous web, potentially through an interaction between ATG5 and NS4B (Refs 108,109) (Fig. 3B). Knockdown of either ubiquitin-like modifier-activating enzyme ATG7 or ubiquitin-like protein ATG12 expression produced aberrant membranous web structures and reduced viral replication, suggesting that this complex contributes to the formation of HCV ROs. For HCV, autophagy has been suggested to function during the early stages of virus infection, such as translation of incoming HCV RNA or formation of the membranous web110,111. Additionally, recent reports indicate roles for autophagy in HCV particle secretion and the release of exosomes, which contain viral RNA fragments and infectious full-length HCV genomes112,113.",

By contrast, HCV induces mitophagy to attenuate virus-induced apoptosis and, consistent with these observations, inhibition of mitophagy by knockdown of parkin impairs HCV replication118. To summarize, autophagy has mostly been attributed to a proviral function in HCV, DENV and ZIKV replication cycles; however, further studies are required to better characterize the molecular mechanisms of autophagy\u2013virus interactions.",

Several studies highlight the importance of lipid biosynthetic pathways in Flavivirus and Hepacivirus replication (Fig. 3C). For instance, DENV, WNV and HCV replication is highly sensitive to depletion or pharmacological inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase (FASN)120,121, which are key enzymes in the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway. Indeed, DENV NS3 and HCV NS5B proteins were shown to interact with FASN and mediate its recruitment to the vicinity of viral replication sites, where it likely promotes the local synthesis of fatty acids that are required for efficient virus replication or, alternatively, enhances the catalytic activity of the NS5B polymerase in the case of HCV119. In addition to fatty acids, cholesterol biosynthesis also appears to be required for Flaviviridae virus replication. Inhibitors of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), a rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic mevalonate pathway, decreases DENV replication in primary human monocytes and cultured cell lines120. It was observed that DENV infection increases the activity of HMGCR through the inactivation of 5\u2032 AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), resulting in higher levels of cholesterol in the ER and increased viral replication122 (Fig. 3C). Consistent with this, treatment with AMPK inhibitors was shown to exert a proviral effect. However, a recent report suggests that DENV infection transiently stimulates AMPK phosphorylation, leading to the inactiation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and induction of lipophagy117. In this study, pharmacological inhibition of AMPK was found to be antiviral. The reasons behind these conflicting results are currently unknown but may relate to the experimental conditions that were used or a cell type-dependent effect.",

Additionally, the ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX3X interacts with the HCV 3\u2032 UTR and activates the innate immunity regulator inhibitor of nuclear factor-\u03baB kinase subunit-\u03b1 (IKK\u03b1), which in turn induces the expression of SREBP through CREB-binding protein\u2013histone acetyltransferase p300 (CBP\u2013p300)-dependent gene induction119,123 (Fig. 3C). Alterations in the lipid profile of infected cells were also uncovered by high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis of DENV, WNV or HCV-infected cells124,125,126. These studies revealed that changes in the lipid composition were especially pronounced in membrane fractions that were enriched in viral ROs, where the content of phospholipids, glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids (mainly ceramide) was increased124,125,126. Interestingly, although DENV and HCV promote an overall increase in cellular phosphatidylcholine content, only HCV seems to induce the accumulation of this lipid in the perinuclear ER membrane where NS5A is present124,126,127. In addition, purification of HCV DMVs revealed cholesterol enrichment, which is otherwise present at low levels in the ER of uninfected cells18. It was found that different cholesterol transport proteins, such as the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) and the Niemann\u2013Pick C1 protein (NPC1), participate in this cholesterol enrichment and are selectively exploited by HCV but not DENV128,129. Overall, these findings support the concept that hepaciviruses and flaviviruses alter the local lipid composition of the ER to promote their replication.",

Reduction of PtdIns4P levels, either through gene PI4KA silencing or pharmacological inhibition, results in the formation of smaller and aggregated DMVs and a consequent reduction in virus replication35. PtdIns4P is required to promote the accumulation of cholesterol at viral replication sites through a non-vesicular cholesterol transport mechanism involving OSBP128 (Fig. 3C, inset). Importantly, PtdIns4P and OSBP activity are required for the formation of the HCV membranous web but are dispensable for DENV replication, highlighting differences between the two virus genera35,128. In the case of HCV, it has been shown that PI4K\u03b1 is recruited by NS5A and NS5B to DMVs, where the kinase is activated to produce high amounts of PtdIns4P locally. It is assumed that PtdIns4P is used to facilitate the release of cholesterol from OSBP, which is discharged from the protein in exchange for PtdIns4P (reviewed in Ref. 8). A similar mechanism might operate for the enrichment of glycosphingolipids in DMV membranes via pleckstrin homology domain-containing family A member 8 (FAPP2)131 (Fig. 3C).",

For DENV infection, entry into host cells depends on microfilament integrity132,133. Additionally, the formation of viral ROs causes substantial remodelling of the intracellular endomembrane system and concomitantly alters the cytoskeletal architecture. DENV and ZIKV rearrange the cytoskeleton to form a cage-like structure that surrounds viral ROs (Fig. 4c). In the case of DENV, the reorganization of the intermediate filament vimentin has been observed, which is thought to arise through interactions with NS4A134. Moreover, treatment of infected cells with drugs that disrupt intermediate filaments also inhibits viral replication135. In ZIKV-infected cells, nuclei are distorted to accommodate the perinuclear accumulation of viral ROs, which are surrounded by thick bundles of intermediate filaments and microtubules. Treatment with paclitaxel, a microtubule-stabilizing drug, has a strong antiviral effect, suggesting that microtubule flexibility is required for efficient ZIKV infection10.",

Inhibition of actin and microtubule polymerization decreases viral RNA levels in HCV-infected cells, suggesting a role for these structures in translation or viral genome amplification137.

For instance, septin 9 interacts with microtubules and PtdIns5P to modulate lipid droplet growth and subcellular localization, creating a lipid-enriched environment that is favourable for HCV replication138 (Fig. 4). Thus, the role of the cytoskeleton may extend beyond viral entry and contribute to the biogenesis and maintenance of viral ROs.",

For instance, the DENV capsid and NS5 proteins contain nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences and localize to the nucleus140.

Two roles for these NLS sequences have been proposed. First, several reports have suggested that nuclear NS5A and core protein directly or indirectly alter host transcriptional activation. Second, recent reports have proposed that the nuclear transport machinery has a cytoplasmic role in protecting HCV RNA from being sensed by PRRs. These reports suggest that HCV recruits components of the NPC and nuclear transport machinery to viral ROs to create a selective barrier between the cytosol and the interior of ROs, thus effectively blocking immune activation while still allowing access to molecules that are required for viral replication21,22,144.",

Flaviviridae family members interact with mitochondria and MAMs to either potentiate or mitigate these mitochondria-associated processes13,149,150. Reports on the impact of flaviviruses, particularly DENV, on mitochondrial structure and function are still somewhat contradictory. Two recent studies demonstrate that DENV or ZIKV infection antagonizes dynamin 1-like protein (DRP1) function, leading to mitochondrial elongation and a reduction in MAMs, which favours viral replication14,151. This virus-induced mitochondrial elongation enhances respiration to increase virus replication, and the sequestration of MAMs in virus-induced CMs appears to contribute to attenuating innate immune activation (Fig. 4). Moreover, the expression of DENV NS4B is sufficient to induce mitochondrial elongation. In contrast to these findings, two other studies have reported DENV-induced mitochondrial fragmentation that is mediated by mitofusin degradation152,153. These studies suggest a mechanism similar to HCV in which virus-induced mitochondrial fission inhibits apoptosis and alleviates immune activation118,154. The differences between these reported observations could arise from differences in experimental setup or host cells that were used for infection. However, in both cases, it is clear that mitochondrial morphodynamics have an important role in Flavivirus infection.",

For instance, the biogenesis and three-dimensional structures of the membranous ROs of flaviviruses are more similar to those of alphaviruses and nodaviruses, whereas the ROs of HCV resemble more those of picornaviruses and coronaviruses (reviewed in Ref. 156). This probably reflects the differential use of distinct lipid synthesis and transfer pathways, which offers an interesting yet challenging alternative for the analysis of virus evolution that so far is primarily based on algorithms comparing nucleotide or amino acid sequence similarities.",

Although studies in more physiologically relevant systems are required to demonstrate the suitability of these targets for therapeutic approaches, the results per se have revealed surprising new insights into the cell biology of these cellular machines. For instance, an individual subunit of the signal peptidase complex can be eliminated without overt cytotoxicity in vitro while blocking virus replication, arguing that an approach that targets this subunit could have strong antiviral effects with low cytotoxicity44. In light of these results, we can expect that additional fundamental discoveries in cell biology will continue to be made while enhancing our understanding of virus replication and pathogenesis. This knowledge may provide insights into how the balance could be tipped in a direction that promotes the activation of pathways that are aimed at limiting virus replication or spread, with the ultimate goal of developing broad-spectrum antivirals.",

Polyprotein cleavage by cellular signal peptidases is indicated by scissors. Arrows denote the cleavage by the viral protease, whereas the black vertical arrow indicates cleavage by the Golgi apparatus-resident protease furin. The question mark denotes a DENV polyprotein cleavage performed by an unknown protease. The DENV structural proteins capsid protein C, prM and envelope protein E are constituents of the virion; NS1, the only non-structural protein residing in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and NS2A are essential for virus replication and production of infectious particles; serine protease subunit NS2B acts as a cofactor for serine protease NS3 and recruits NS3 to ER membranes; NS3 is a multifunctional protein with protease, nucleotide 5\u2032 triphosphatase (NTPase), RNA 5\u2032 triphosphatase and helicase activities; NS4A is an integral membrane protein with membrane curvature-inducing activity; the 2K peptide serves as a signal peptide for co-translational NS4B insertion into the ER membrane; NS4B is a protein with no reported enzymatic activity that interacts with NS3 and is absolutely required for virus replication; NS5 consists of an N-terminal domain that possesses guanylyltransferase, guanine-N7-methyltransferase and nucleoside-2\u2032-O-methyltransferase activities involved in 5\u2032-RNA capping and methylation of the viral genome, and a C-terminal domain with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity responsible for viral RNA synthesis. b | The HCV RNA genome is \u223c9.6 kb long, uncapped and flanked by highly structured 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 NTRs. The 5\u2032 NTR contains a type III internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that directs the cap-independent translation of the viral RNA genome. Polyprotein cleavage by the viral protease is indicated by arrows, whereas cleavage by cellular signal peptidases is indicated by scissors. The cleavage by the cellular signal peptide peptidase resulting in the removal of the HCV core carboxy- terminal region is indicated by an asterisk. The core protein and the envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 constitute the viral particle, whereas p7 and NS2 support particle assembly yet are not incorporated into virions; the NS2 C-terminal domain contains a cysteine protease that catalyses the cleavage of the NS2\u2013NS3 junction; NS3 contains serine protease, RNA helicase and NTPase activities; NS4A acts as cofactor for the NS3 protease and anchors NS3 to ER membranes; NS4B is involved in the formation of the HCV replication organelle; NS5A is a phosphoprotein with an intrinsically unfolded C-terminal region that mediates interactions with numerous cellular proteins; NS5B is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase responsible for RNA synthesis. Note that only the DENV capsid and NS1 as well as HCV NS5A are shown as dimers, but additional viral proteins form homodimers and heterodimers or oligomeric complexes.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is shown in brown and blue for DENV and ZIKV, respectively. Virus-induced vesicles are in light brown for DENV and dark blue for ZIKV. Virus particles are depicted in red (DENV) and gold (ZIKV). Ab | Schematic representation of the Flavivirus replication and assembly compartments. Genome replication occurs within vesicle packets (VPs) formed upon ER membrane invagination. Pore-like openings connect the interior of vesicles with the cytosol to allow for metabolite exchange and trafficking of the newly synthesized RNA genome. Virions assemble through nucleocapsid budding within ER cisternae close to VPs. Particles arrange in crystalline arrays within swollen ER cisternae connected to VPs. Ac | Model of Flavivirus-induced vesicle biogenesis. Negative membrane curvatures might be induced by non-structural protein 4A (NS4A) and NS4B amphipathic \u03b1-helices that are partially embedded within the ER luminal membrane leaflet. Negative curvature might be stabilized by homo-oligomerization and hetero-oligomerization between NS4A and NS4B along with interaction with NS1 dimers associated with the luminal side of the vesicle. NS2A and other host factors might further contribute to induce membrane alterations and stabilize the pore-like opening. B | Architecture of Hepacivirus replication organelles. Ba | Hepatitis C virus (HCV) membranous web as revealed by electron tomography and three-dimensional reconstruction of infected cells. The ER is shown in dark brown. Double-membrane vesicle (DMV) outer membranes are depicted in light brown and inner membranes in orange. Cytoskeletal filaments, Golgi apparatus cisternae and single-membrane vesicles (SMVs) are shown in blue, green and violet, respectively. Bb | Schematic representation of the HCV replication and assembly compartment. DMVs form as ER protrusions and contain the non-structural proteins that are responsible for viral genome replication. Replicase activity might cease upon vesicle closure (grey shaded vesicle). Alternatively, the viral replicase might be associated with the exterior of DMVs. Newly synthetized RNA might be delivered to assembly sites by NS5A and serine protease NS3 in a process assumed to involve core protein-loaded cytosolic lipid droplets. Formation of nucleocapsids is concomitant with particle budding into the ER lumen. Bc | Model of HCV-induced DMV biogenesis. The amphipathic \u03b1-helices and the oligomerization capabilities of the replicase proteins NS4B and NS5A, perhaps along with components of the autophagy machinery (not shown), might promote positive membrane curvature and DMV formation.
