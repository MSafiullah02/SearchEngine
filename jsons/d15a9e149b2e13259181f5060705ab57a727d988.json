It has led governments to take both public measures for population containment and often a resetting of healthcare organization in order to be able to absorb the peak of patients in particular for critical care. Since the inception of the outbreak, all stakeholders seemed keen to access to reliable and \"living\" information regarding the evolution of cases, hospitalisations and deaths in their countries as well as in others. Crossareas comparisons were made to understand some characteristics of this novel epidemic. [1, 2] Also, being able to predict at least in the short term, the evolution of the main outcome indicators has been a relentless objective of care providers and decision makers. A single tool providing such an aid would be likely to respectively inform people and enlighten relevant stakeholders to anticipate the needed measures, in particular regarding the steering of care and social measures. We therefore developed an online model, intended to be freely accessible to the community.",

A classical SIR model considers 3 types of individuals: susceptible individuals (S), infected individuals (I) and recovered individuals (R). [4] Many extensions to this model have been proposed, in particular by adding a compartment of exposed but noncontagious individuals (E) to the model. [5] Other models distinguish between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, between patients admitted to intensive care units and patients admitted to regular hospital. [6] [7] [8] The more complex these models are, the more parameters they depend on. A classical method then consists of fixing the value of some of these parameters to values found in the literature and varying the other parameters in order to obtain simulations with dynamics that are similar to those of the data. The main objective of these approaches is not to adjust data, but rather to develop a model that is supposed to represent the reality as closely as possible. Our approach was different: our main objective was to develop an epidemiological model that fits the observed data as closely as possible, while at the same time being as simple as possible.",

(Figure 1) A fundamental parameter of the model is the transmission rate, which indicates how quickly people become infected and become contagious themselves. Our model integrates a timedependent transmission rate, whose variations can be thought to be related to the public measures taken by the country in question. One can thus imagine that the transmission rate was stable -and possibly high -before lockdown and then decreased with lockdown in countries that have adopted such a measure. A piecewise linear model was used for the transmission rate to take into account these possible variations. As the number of segments and the location of the changes in the slope are unknown, they were estimated together with the model parameters.",

Our model has several strengths. First, it fits the observed data, through a mechanistic modelling. Second, it appears to be validated by the data, with good short-term predictions in all tested cases. Third, it is a parsimonious model, as very few parameters are needed to describe the outcome of interest, and the prediction proved stable over time. Fourth, we implemented it as an open-access interactive tool, so as to make it operational for any relevant stakeholder for the immediate benefit of the scientific and general community in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak.
