Although ART often restores peripheral CD4+ T cell counts, persistent immune dysfunction and inflammation strongly predict risk of non-AIDS morbidity and mortality1\u20133. Enhanced inflammation is also apparent in elite controllers who show no detectable levels of HIV RNA in the absence of ART. The cause and cellular source(s) of chronic inflammation associated with HIV-1 have not been fully elucidated. Inflammatory responses are best characterized and most potently induced by innate immune cells like monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs). Less is known about the responses of innate immune receptors in CD4+ T cells, despite the fact that T cells also express classical pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) like Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and inflammasomes, suggesting that they can directly recognize and respond to microbial and danger molecules4. HIV-1 targets immune cells and innate immune sensors are thus remarkably positioned at the nexus of viral replication and immunity.",

            "text": "HIV-1 infects a number of cell types. However, viral replication mainly occurs in CD4+ T cells. HIV-1 entry into target cells requires the attachment of the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 to CD4, followed by CXCR4 or CCR5 co-receptor-mediated fusion with the host cell membrane. The choice of co-receptor is dictated by viral tropism: R5-tropic HIV dominates in the early stages of infection while X4-tropic virus emerges in advanced disease5. Direct cell transfer of the virus from an HIV-1-infected cell to a juxtaposed target cell has been shown to be the predominant mode of transmission. It is estimated that infection by cell-associated virus is 18,000-fold more efficient than cell-free virus when compared in vitro6, and based on experimental and mathematical models, cell-to-cell transmission is thought to contribute to 60% of total virus infection7. HIV dissemination occurs in lymphoid tissues where a high concentration of T cells is present. DCs are thought to seed HIV infection in the lymph nodes by transmitting the virus to T cells during antigen presentation8. However, productively infected T cells are highly migratory and can disseminate the infection through cell-to-cell transmission locally in the lymph node. In addition, recirculation of HIV-infected T cells is important for the establishment of systemic infection9. Physical contact between donor and target cell results in the formation of a virological synapse (VS), stabilized by the interactions of HIV-Env/CD4 and adhesion molecules, which triggers uptake of virus by the target cell10. Endosomal uptake of HIV-1 relies on the binding of HIV-gp120 to CD4 and is independent of engagement of CXCR4 or CCR5 co-receptors11. However, in the presence of the appropriate co-receptor, the virus can enter the cytoplasm by fusing with endosomal membranes resulting in productive infection of the target cells12. Failure to engage the co-receptor due to inappropriate virus tropism can lead to recycling of the virus to the cell surface11,13 as well as inactivation and degradation in endosomal compartments14\u201316. It is currently not clear to what extent HIV-1 activates CD4+ T cell PRRs during the various stages of infection, and how this would impact infection. In this situation, the local cytokine environment may well be shaped by T cells and act in an autocrine/paracrine manner.",

            "text": "Ten functional TLRs have been discovered in humans of which TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 are located in endosomes and lysosomes17. TLR7 and TLR8 recognize single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) in the forms of degradation products, nucleosides, and oligoribonucleotides18\u201322 while TLR3 and TLR9 bind double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), respectively23,24. Activated \ufeffTLR dimers recruit adaptor proteins \ufeffMyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response 88) or TRIF (Toll/interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor domain-containing adapter protein inducing interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2)) which signal through sequential activation of IRAK (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase) family kinases, IKKs (inhibitor of \u03baB kinase), and MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinase), leading to the activation of the transcription factors NF-\u03baB and AP-1-driving inflammatory cytokines, or interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) driving type I IFNs25. Several disease-causing viruses interact with endosomal TLRs including West Nile virus, Epstein-Barr-virus, influenza and HIV-126. HIV-1 is an enveloped retrovirus with two copies of a ssRNA genome that may be recognized by TLR7 and TLR827\u201329. HIV endocytosis by plasmacytoid DCs induces TLR7 activation and type I IFN production30. In monocytes and myeloid DCs, TLR8 has been shown to recognize HIV ssRNA resulting in MyD88-dependent activation and subsequent interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 production31\u201335. Several studies show expression of TLR7 and TLR9 in CD4+ T cells36\u201339 whereas inconsistent results are reported for TLR8: some studies claim that TLR8 is present in T cells38,40, while others show the absence of the receptor39,41. In a study by Dominguez-Villar et al.42, TLR7 stimulation increased HIV replication in productively infected CD4+ T cells while inhibition of TLR7 had the opposite effect, suggesting a role for TLR7 in the regulation of the viral life cycle42. Here, we reveal that HIV-1 is endocytosed and recognized by TLR8 in human primary CD4+ T cells and that TLR8 stimulation induces an inflammatory response that favors HIV-1 replication and reversal of latency. Our results uncover a function for TLR8 in human primary CD4+ T cells as adjuvant in activation of inflammatory cytokines and in HIV replication.",

Most peripheral CD4+ T cells express CXCR4 (Supplementary Fig. 1d) but both X4- and R5-tropic virus were utilized. Primary CD4+ T cells from HIV-negative donors were activated by TCR stimulation using anti-CD3 coated plates and soluble anti-CD28 for 48 h. Activated CD4+ T cells were co-cultured for 3 h with donor HeLa or HEK293T cells expressing the X4 HIV-1-Gag-iGFP, human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) infected with R5 HIV-1-Gag-iGFP or donor CD4+ T cells infected with X4-Gag-iGFP in the presence of the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 or the CCR5 inhibitor Maraviroc, to prevent co-receptor mediated HIV-1 fusion. T cells were trypsinized prior to analysis to remove extracellular membrane-bound virus. In agreement with previous studies11,43, confocal microscopy revealed that HIV-1 accumulated in VS and was transferred to intracellular (trypsin-resistant) compartments in the target CD4+ T cell (Fig. 1a, b). Transfer of virus also occurred at VS if primary HIV-infected MDMs or CD4+ T cells were used as donor cells (Fig. 1a). Quantification revealed an average of close to 30 intracellular virus puncta per acceptor T cell after 24 h of co-culture (Fig. 1b). The trypsin-resistant HIV-1 compartments only occasionally stained positive for markers of early endosomes (EEA1) or late endosomes/lysosomes (LAMP1) (Supplementary Fig. 1b). We further utilized flow cytometry to quantify the frequency of CD4+ T cells harboring intracellular HIV-1 (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1c), which decreased over time when fusion was inhibited by AMD3100 (Fig. 1c). Inhibition of uptake by pre-treatment with the dynamin inhibitor Dynasore markedly reduced the amount of CD4+ T cells harboring trypsin-resistant HIV (Fig. 1d). In addition, we compared the efficiency of cell-associated and cell-free virus in infecting primary CD4+ T cells. SupT1 cells were infected with eGPF+ HIV-1 prior to co-culture with TCR-activated CD4+ T cells in the presence or absence of a 0.4 \u03bcm trans-well membrane barrier allowing only cell-free virus to pass. In agreement with previous studies, infection with cell-associated virus resulted in significantly higher infection rate of CD4+ T cells when compared with cell-free virus (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Our results thus indicate that HIV-1 is efficiently endocytosed upon cell-to-cell transfer and, in the absence of co-receptor binding, later degraded within the acceptor T cell.",

However, endosomal TLR responses in T cells are poorly characterized so we initially assessed functional endosomal TLR responses in primary CD4+ T cells using synthetic ligands. CD4+ T cells were purified from HIV-negative donors, yielding 95.7% CD3+CD4+ T cells with less than 1% monocytes or DCs (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). Untreated or TCR-activated CD4+ T cells were challenged with increasing concentrations of TLR7 ligand CL264, TLR7/8 ligand R848, TLR8 ligands CL75, polyU/poly l-arginine (pU/pLA) or TL8-506, or TLR9 ligand CpG for 24 h and assessed for IL-6 production by ELISA (Fig. 2a). IL-6 was secreted by resting CD4+ T cells in response to all TLR8 ligands while TLR7 or TLR9 ligands did not induce IL-6 secretion (Fig. 2a, left). In TCR-activated T cells, concomitant treatment with TLR8 ligands further increased IL-6 secretion (Fig. 2a, right): at low doses (0.2\u20131.0 \u00b5g/ml), TLR8 and TLR7/8 ligands induced 7 to 30 times higher IL-6 levels relative to the TLR7 ligands R837 and CL264 (Fig. 2a, right). TLR7 ligands did increase IL-6 secretion at high doses (5 \u00b5g/ml), but this was not the case for the TLR9 ligand CpG. TLR8 ligands also induced IL-6 production from ultrapure T cells (>99.5% CD4+ T cells; Supplementary Fig. 2c). Addition of 0.3% CD14+ monocytes (corresponds to the maximum of CD14+ cells that we see in isolations) or (CD4+ T cell-depleted) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) did not significantly affect TLR8-induced IL-6 or IFN\u03b3 production from CD4+ T cells (Supplementary Fig. 2d, e). Higher amounts of contaminating cells affected IL-6 but not IFN\u03b3 production (Supplementary Fig. 2d, e). Thus, IL-6 and T cell intrinsic IFN\u03b3 was mainly contributed from CD4+ T cells.",

TLR8-induced IL-6 was significantly reduced by inhibitors CU-CPT9a and CU-CPT9b (Fig. 2c). Inhibitor CU-CPT9b was superior compared to CU-CPT9a and almost completely blocked IL-6 secretion at the highest concentration used (5 \u00b5M). As expected, the TLR8 inhibitors had no effect on cells treated with the TLR2 ligand FSL-1, whereas some reduction of CL264 induced IL-6 was observed at high concentrations of CU-CPT9b (Fig. 2c).

CL75, CL264, and R848 showed no effect, suggesting differential responses even to different TLR8 ligands. Of note, the TLR9 ligand CpG prevented TCR-mediated upregulation of activation markers, which is in line with the inhibitory effect seen on cytokine secretion (Supplementary Fig. 4).

Phosphorylation of the more distal proteins in the MAPK (MAPK p38 and ERK1/2) and NF-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB p65) pathways was highest 5 min post TCR activation. Additional TLR7/8 stimulation significantly increased phosphorylation of p38 (2.3-fold) but not ERK1/2 and NF-\u03baB pS536, although the tendency was the same (1.3-fold for ERK1/2 and NF-\u03baB pS536). No activation of NF-\u03baB p65 phosphorylation was observed by engagement of TLR7 or TLR8 alone. Taken together, the main immediate effect of TLR7/8 engagement seemed to be adjunctive in strengthening some of the TCR signaling pathways, such as ribosomal protein S6 and pathways that cross with canonical TLR signaling like the MAPK and NF-\u03baB pathways.",

APCs are a major source of lineage-polarizing cytokines, but our results suggest that T cells themselves could be contributing since IL-6 is known to induce expression of ROR\u03b3T (retinoic acid-related orphan receptor \u03b3T) which drives Th17 differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we compared the production of signature cytokines associated with different effector T cell lineages in TCR + TLR-activated CD4+ T cells over time using intracellular flow cytometry (Fig. 5a\u2013c). TLR8 stimulation significantly increased production of Th1 cytokine IFN-\u03b3 and Th17 cytokine IL-17 compared to TCR activation alone, whereas no effect was seen on the Th2 cytokine IL-4, or on TNF-\u03b1 and IL-2 (Fig. 5c). TLR7 or TLR9 ligands did not affect cytokine production. To further verify that the observed responses were from TLR ligands acting directly on T cells, we added up to 3% CD14+ monocytes or PBMCs depleted of CD4+ cells to the purified CD4+ T cells before TCR+TLR stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 2e). The addition of monocytes or CD4+-depleted PBMCs did not influence on TLR8-induced IFN-\u03b3 production from CD4+ T cells. However, under these conditions the T cells responded to CpG with IFN-\u03b3 production, most likely indirectly via CpG activation of monocytes or DCs. Finally, in agreement with other studies39, we found that CD4+ T cells with a memory phenotype (CD45RO+CD45RA\u2212) responded with higher IFN-\u03b3-production in response to TCR+TLR8 stimulation than na\u00efve cells (CD45RO\u2212CD45RA+) (Supplementary Fig. 5a).",

Using a cell-to-cell transmission model, we show that X4- and R5-tropic HIV-1 is endocytosed in human CD4+ T cells and induce TLR8-dependent secretion of inflammatory cytokines, mirroring the response obtained with synthetic TLR8 ligands. Stimulation of TCR-activated CD4+ T cells with TLR8 ligands induced a \u201chyper-activation\u201d state, marked by upregulation of activation markers and increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines, and differentiation towards pro-inflammatory Th1/Th17 effector cells. The TLR8 inhibitors CU-CPT9a and CU-CPT9b abolished the responses to TLR8 ligands demonstrating that the observed adjuvant effect was specific to TLR8. TLR8 activation also enhanced HIV-1 replication and induced reactivation of latent virus in T cells from virologically suppressed HIV patients on ART. These findings indicate a role for TLR8 in HIV-1 infection, where a \u201cdead-end\u201d pathway of HIV-1 endocytosis could contribute to the spread of virus in lymphoid tissues by promoting a higher degree of CD4+ T cell activation, thus priming bystander and latently infected CD4+ T cells for viral replication.",

However, precisely assessing the contribution of cell-associated and cell-free virus to HIV disease in vivo is challenging since both modes of transmission occur concurrently and interdependently. Productively infected T cells are highly migratory and have been shown to disseminate HIV through cell-to-cell transmission locally in the lymph node of humanized mice9. Furthermore, recirculation of HIV-infected T cells was important for the establishment of systemic infection. In addition, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected PBMCs isolated from rhesus monkeys penetrated the colon epithelial layer and established new infection of host cells, while cell-free virus failed to do so60. Similar results were obtained in HIV infection of human colonic tissue explants60.

The expression pattern of CCR5 and CXCR4 on CD4+ T cells can differ in various subpopulations and over the course of infection61,62. Therefore, a mismatch between virus tropism and the co-receptor is plausible. Failure of the virus to enter the cytosol can lead to recycling to the cell surface or degradation11,63. Our data show that in the presence of fusion inhibitor, HIV is internalized into a trypsin-resistant compartment that only occasionally stains positive for early (EEA1) or late (LAMP1) endosomal markers. We observed patches of co-localized P24/EEA1 that resemble the findings by Bosch et al.65, but overall co-localization events were few as also shown by others for LAMP164,65. However, Dynasore inhibited endocytosis of HIV by T cells suggesting that clathrin-dynamin endocytosis is driving HIV uptake in the endosome as shown in other studies11,65\u201367. HIV could be transiently passing through EEA1+ endosomes and rapidly degraded in LAMP1+ endolysosomes or possibly trafficked through other, less well-characterized endosomal compartments in the T cell. Whether TLR8 signaling originates from this compartment or if the viral RNA is trafficked further is currently unclear. Acidic environment is not a requirement for TLR8 activation. Endosomal TLR8 dimers are cleaved by neutral proteases, and studies in myeloid DCs have shown that retaining HIV or TLR8 ligands in early endosomes by preventing maturation, increases activation34. HIV endocytosis was not completely inhibited in our experiments. Dynasore has been shown to interfere with HIV replication, therefore target CD4+ T cells were only pre-treated with Dynasore and washed prior to infection (co-culture with HIV donor cells)68. This partial effect can be due to reversible inhibition of dynamin by Dynasore and its loss of potency due to the presence of serum in the culture media69.",

The TLR7 ligand CL264 induced lower levels of IL-6 than TLR8 ligands while the TLR9 ligand CpG showed no effect or even decreased cytokine secretion induced by TCR activation of the T cells. CL264 is a synthetic TLR7 ligand (adenine analog) and we cannot guarantee that it does not show some cross reactivity to TLR870.

In this study, the TLR7 ligands Imiquimod (R837) and CL264 inhibited secretion of IL-2, IL-4, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-17 in CD4+ T cells. This is in contrast to our findings that R837 and CL264 rather induced IL-6 secretion\u2014which was not measured in the study by Dominguez-Villar. However, we did see inhibition of T cell cytokine production and upregulation of activation markers with the TLR9 ligand, CpG, although CpG was not investigated in the study by Dominguez-Villar et al.42. In addition, Dominguez-Villar et al. show increased viral replication in response to R837, which is different from our findings using CL264 that did not affect viral replication. We cannot explain these discrepancies, but the ligand dose, timing, and experimental assays could play a role. Moreover, Dominguez-Villar et al. used a model of productive HIV-1 infection with cell-free virus, and it is unclear how cytoplasmic HIV-1 RNA would enter the endosome and efficiently engage TLR7 in this infection model since the virus would fuse with host cell membranes and enter the cytosol42. Therefore, more research is needed to fully understand the mechanism by which TLR7 is activated by cytoplasmic HIV RNA. TLR2 and TLR5 have also been implicated in modulating TCR responses in CD4+ T cells36,71 and we observed cytokine secretion induced by the TLR2 ligand FSL-1 in our study. HIV-1 may express TLR2 ligands; however, since TLR8-specific inhibitors dose-dependently inhibited HIV-1-induced cytokine responses and did not affect FSL-1-induced cytokines, we feel confident that TLR8 is the major receptor engaged by HIV-1 in our study. Other immune cells expressing TLR8 will respond to endosomal HIV ssRNA with cytokine secretion, and in particular myeloid cells such as macrophages and DCs. Whereas plasmacytoid DCs sense endosomal HIV-1 ssRNA by TLR7 and induce protective type I interferon responses31,72, myeloid DCs, and macrophages sense endosomal HIV-1 ssRNA by TLR8 but fail to induce a protective immune response (e.g. type I IFNs)33\u201335. In the T cell zone of the lymph node, the contribution of TLR8-mediated cytokine from a large number of T cells could play a role in HIV pathophysiology. IL-6 plays a central role in HIV infection. It promotes Th17 and inhibits Treg differentiation, and acts as a co-stimulatory factor enhancing proliferation and cell survival by counteracting activation-induced cell death73. A recent study shows that IL-6 is a stronger predictor of fatal events than C-reactive protein in ART-treated patients74.",

The natural ligands for TLR7 and 8 are ssRNAs in the forms of degradation products, nucleosides (guanosine and uridine, respectively), and oligoribonucleotides engaging different binding pockets. CL75, CL264, and R837 are synthetic imidazoquinolinone derivatives (IQDs) that are able to strongly interact with TLR7 and 8 homodimers and activate signaling in the absence of oligonucleotides, which are believed to function mainly to enhance the binding affinities of the nucleosides/IQDs70,75\u201377. PolyU is solely capable of activating TLR8, but interactions are stronger if combined with degradation products (uridine, endogenous nucleoside derivatives or IQDs). In addition, the structure of ligands affects their solubility; polyU is membrane impermeable and requires endocytosis whereas IQDs are lipid soluble and could engage TLR8 in compartments different from polyU. Both polyU and CL75 are considered more specific activators of TLR8 than TLR7. However, structural binding studies show that some cross-specificity is possible70. Although differences in potency was expected, we were surprised by the consistent differences observed between CL75 and polyU: polyU was most efficient in HIV reactivation and in upregulation of T cell activation markers whereas CL75 was most potent in enhancing HIV replication. Other studies have also pointed out differences in signaling between different TLR7/8 ligands78. Human PBMCs respond to R848 and ssRNA with pro-inflammatory cytokines but only ssRNA was able to induce type I IFNs79 and recent studies suggest ligand-induced trafficking of TLR containing endosomes dictates different responses22,80,81.",

            "text": "Despite the success of ART in reducing viremia to undetectable levels, virus eradication has remained elusive. Since ART is only effective against actively replicating HIV-1, long-lived latently infected cells are not eliminated and, when activated, are capable of reseeding the infection in the absence of ART. Our data show that TLR8 stimulation boosts the activation of latent HIV-1. PolyU's latency reversal activity surpassed that of other better studied latency reversing agents (LRAs) such as SAHA and Bryostatin. The observed lack of activity of SAHA is in agreement with a recent study demonstrating that LRAs that do not activate T cells do not induce substantial increase in intracellular HIV-1 mRNA in patient cells82. The latency reversal activity of PolyU is most likely mediated by NF-\u03baB as it is a well-known transcriptional regulator of the HIV promoter83. In addition, TLR8 activation induces IL-6 secretion that can promote the expression of NFATc2 which in turn enhances HIV transcription by binding to the HIV LTR84,85. Trans-infection of latently infected CD4+ T cells could thus result in reactivation of HIV-1 by activation of the TCR with concomitant TLR8 signaling from endosomal degradation of virus particles. Even well-controlled HIV patients on ART experience blips of viral replication, most likely from activation of reservoirs86,87. This is one among many suggested explanations for why long-term HIV patients suffer from low-grade chronic inflammation and premature aging2,3. TLR8 boosting of TCR cytokine responses and viral replication could thus contribute to sustained inflammation in HIV, although this would have to be tested in in vivo models of HIV infection.",

Synthetic TLR8 ligands have been reported to reverse latency in PBMCs, monocytic cell lines, and T cell lines93\u201395. Here we demonstrate the direct effect of TLR8 stimulation in highly pure primary human CD4+ T cells on activation and production on inflammatory cytokines. We also show that TLR8 stimulation contributes to reversion of latency in patient-derived latently infected CD4+ T cells, thus adding knowledge to a growing body of evidence that synthetic TLR ligands can play an important role in HIV cure research. These results reinforce the clinical relevance of our study and suggest TLR8 agonists should be considered for \u201cshock-and-kill\u201d strategies alongside LRAs already in clinical trials.",

In comparison to negative isolation, positive isolation by magnetic beads or FACS sorting yield higher purity (>99%) but can alter CD4+ T cell functional responses due to antibody labeling, and the physical stress applied to the cells during FACS sorting. We therefore used a negative isolation protocol in our study with which we consistently achieved CD3+CD4+ T cell purities of >95% with only minimal contamination of CD14+ (0.18%) cells with a monocyte phenotype or CD303+ (0.14%) or CD123+ (0.24%) cells with a DC phenotype. In addition, we confirmed IL-6 induction by TLR8 ligands in positively isolated CD4+ T cells, where we achieved a purity of >99.5% CD3+CD4+ T cells. Finally, TLR8 ligand induced IL-17 and IFN-\u03b3 was assessed by intracellular staining and flow cytometry and cytokine responses were inhibited by TLR8 inhibitors, further confirming that CD4+ T cells express functional TLR8.",

A recent study reported TLR8-mediated reversal of Treg suppressive functions through inhibition of glucose uptake and glycolysis96. Our data show that TLR8 and TLR7 stimulation enhanced TCR activation by increasing the level of phosphorylated proteins involved in TCR signaling such as ribosomal protein S6 and, MAPK signaling (p38, ERK1/2) and NF\u03baB p65. Unfortunately, due to the lack of antibodies that work satisfactory in phospho-flow, we could not assess TLR-specific signaling (IRAK4, TRAF6, IRFs). Despite comparable activation of TCR downstream signaling pathways, TLR8 stimulation was sufficient to induce IL-6 production from CD4+ T cells by itself and potently increased TCR activation, whereas the TLR7 ligand CL264 was inefficient and required additional TCR stimulation to increase low-level IL-6 secretion. Moreover, TLR7 stimulation showed no effect on IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17. Differences in potency of the ligands or in signaling pathways downstream of TLR7 and TLR8 seem plausible but needs to be proved.",

Mechanistically this is most likely driven by TLR8-induced IFN\u03b3 and IL-6 in a paracrine/autocrine feedback loop: IFN\u03b3 is known to induce T-bet (STAT1 signaling) and IL-6 induces ROR\u03b3T (STAT3 signaling). Interestingly, IL-6 in this scenario is often said to originate from innate cells whereas we show that T cell intrinsic TLR8 activation can induce this feedback loop. Th1 and Th17 effector cells are proposed to support HIV-1 long-term persistence in patients receiving ART49, further supporting a pro-viral role of TLR8 stimulation in T cells. TLR ligands have been investigated for the ability to act as adjuvants to modulate the vaccine immune response, primarily due to their action on innate immune cells97. Our results show that stimulation of CD4+T cells with TLR8 ligands even in the absence of innate immune cells increases the frequencies of IFN-\u03b3- and IL-17-producing effector cells. The observation that TLR8 ligands show a direct effect on CD4+ T cells may thus have implications for vaccine research.",

            "text": "Based on previous studies and our data, we propose a model where a \u201cdead-end\u201d pathway for HIV-1 infection can contribute to viral dissemination: HIV-1-infected APCs or T cells migrate to the lymph node and transmit the virus to uninfected CD4+ T cells during cell-to-cell contact. If the appropriate co-receptor is present, the virus can fuse from the endosome and initiate productive infection by replicating in the target cell. Conversely, endosomal HIV-1 that is not capable of undergoing fusion due to the absence of the appropriate co-receptor can be degraded and engage TLR8. In our in vitro model CXCR4/CCR5 inhibitors were used to trap HIV-1 in endosomal compartments, thus optimizing the conditions to fully induce TLR8 activation. The extent of co-receptor mismatch will vary in HIV-infected individuals and over time within the same patient, making it difficult to predict to what extent T cell intrinsic TLR8 engagement will influence HIV pathology in patients. The relevance should be most apparent in secondary lymphoid tissues where the majority of HIV replication occurs due to the presence of high number of T cells. Secretion of inflammatory cytokines in the extracellular milieu may in turn act on productively infected cells, enhancing viral replication and commit the T cells to differentiation towards the pro-inflammatory Th1/Th17 axis and thus contribute to the pathology of HIV infection such as viral dissemination and the establishment of long-lived HIV reservoirs. Moreover, TLR8 activation by endosomal HIV may support the low-level viral replication and \u201cblips\u201d occurring in patients on ART, and thus contribute to low-grade chronic inflammation in these patients. More studies are needed to assess the contribution of cell-to-cell transmission and TLR8 activation of CD4+ T cells to HIV disease in humans.",
