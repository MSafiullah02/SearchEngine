Three 32 weeks after therapy onset, the patient was diagnosed with Covid-19, had a mild course of 33 the disease, and fully recovered from the infection. 34 To the Editor: 36 37 Monoclonal antibodies ( biologics ) such as dupilumab , a fully human monoclonal antibody 38 blocking interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signaling, started recently to be successfully used 39 also for the treatment of severe forms of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (1). 40 Currently, no data is available on whether the therapy with dupilumab influences the risk of 41 infection with the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) or if it modulates the course of disease. 43 Here, we report a case of a 53-years-old female patient (BMI 23.5) treated with dupilumab 44 for uncontrolled severe CRSwNP, who developed a COVID-19 infection. Twenty years ago, 45 the patient consulted her physician because of rhinitis, which was consecutively diagnosed 46 as CRSwNP. At that time, she also developed asthma, and in 2005, reported respiratory 47 symptoms following intake of two different NSAIDs. No further diagnostic tests were 48 performed. Despite the administration of oral prednisolone three times a year, the 49 regrowing nasal polyps had to be surgically removed in 2012, 2016, and 2019. She was 50 receiving prednisolone due to recurrent documented nasal polyps extending beyond the 51 middle nasal passage on both sides (Davos Score 4 NP, a sum of both sides). The last course 52 of prednisolone was administered in January 2020. In February 2020, the patient was 53 admitted to our outpatient department for possible alternative treatment and was offered 54 therapy with dupilumab for uncontrolled CRSwNP. Also, she was administered mometasone 55 furoate 400 \u00b5g/ day; fluticasone/salmeterol 250/ 50 \u00b5g 2-0-2; and salbutamol when needed. 56 The following set of clinical tests used in our clinic as a standard to characterize the patients 57 with CRSwNP was applied: 58 \u2022 Rhinological parameters: Nasal endoscopy Davos-score score 1: NP in middle meatus 59 only; score 2: NP beyond middle meatus; score 3: NP not blocking the nose 60 completely; score 4: NP completely obstructing the nose; a sum of both nasal sides. 61 \u2022 Pulmonary parameters: the asthma control test (ACT)-score with ACT-score \u2265 20 as 62 controlled asthma; ACT-score < 20 as uncontrolled asthma (2) At presentation, the pulmonary parameters of the patient were FEV1/ FVC ratio 62%; FEV1 70 57%; Asthma Control Test (ACT) score 16 (see Table 1 ). Dupilumab (300mg) was ",

            "text": "24 th, 2020, in the outpatient ORL ward. The subcutaneous72    injections with dupilumab were continued on the 8 th and 30 th of March 2020 by self-73 application. Smell impairment, runny nose, and postnasal drip (PND) disappeared within two74    weeks from the therapy onset, and the nasal congestion kept improving. The decreased from 38 to 8. Between the 11 th and 15 th of March, the patient went on a trip with (50 years old, BMI 31.6) developed fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Two days later,78    the patient, too, developed a fever and later cough. The SNOT-22 increased to 24. On March 79 16 th , based on a viral PCR test, the patient and her husband were diagnosed with and were quarantined at home for two weeks. The patient continued the treatment with 81 dupilumab by self-injection. Two weeks after the Covid-19 diagnosis, the patient and her 82 husband were entirely relieved from the COVID-19 symptoms. The administration of 83 Dupilumab continued at home on March 22 nd , 2020. During the telephone interview on84    March 30 th , 2020, the patient reported complete control of nasal polyp symptoms,85    normosmia, and a low To summarize, our CRSwNP patient treated with dupilumab had an unexpectedly light 87 course of the COVID-19 disease (Table 2). A few possible reasons might explain that. The first 88 reason for the observed clinical course of Covid-19 in our patient could be that ongoing 89 therapy with dupilumab already after a short time controlled the CRSwNP symptoms by 90 reducing local inflammation and improving nasal respiration. Improvement of sino-nasal 91 function could be essential for the initial combating of COVID-19 disease. Before therapy 92 with dupilumab, our patient had poorly controlled asthma. Already after the second 93 injection, she shifted into controlled asthma. Similarly, her nasal symptoms (e.g., nasal 94 congestion) improved, positively affecting the upper respiratory tract. The second reason for 95 the light course of Covid-19 might be the recently described negative association between 96 an increased number of eosinophils and the viral load (4). Such an increase was indeed seen 97 in our patient (Table E1), corroborating the observations made during clinical trials with 98 dupilumab (5). The third possible reason for the uneventful Covid-19 could be that the initial 99 viral load of SARS-CoV-2 was rather low upon infection, and the disease course was not 100 associated with the dupilumab treatment. 101 Finally, the direct positive effect of dupilumab on the Covid-19 infection cannot be excluded, 102 as it modulates immunity by affecting the Th2-type immune responses. It is tempting to 103 speculate that this type of modulation might be beneficial to combat the Covid-19 disease, 104 which is supported by higher levels of IL-4 associating with a fatal disease (6). However, our 105 patient received dupilumab for only a short period before infection, while observations 106 made during clinical trials indicated that the full effect of dupilumab on the immune of dupilumab treatment during the infection with SARS-CoV-2 is in 109 agreement with our own clinical experience and with the current recommendations of the 110 German Society for Allergology and Clinical Immunology (7) about the continuation of the 111 biologics treatment for severe CRSwNP. Interruption of therapy could lead to the 112 progression of rhinosinusitis, expansion of polyp formation, and worsening of common 113 comorbidities such as asthma. That, in turn, could negatively impact the course of a Covid-19 114 disease and increase the spread of the virus by coughing. Also, many patients would have to 115 be put back on therapy with systemic glucocorticosteroids if the biologic treatment were 116 discontinued, which could have an undesirable effect on the immune defense against 117 COVID-19. In the case of our patient, systemic glucocorticosteroids were administered just 118 until before the start of therapy with dupilumab. Given the wash-out time of 22 hours, our 119 patient was no longer under the direct anti-inflammatory influence of prednisolone.However, glucocorticoids can influence immunity, for instance, by inducing the , patients with chronic lung diseases (such as asthma) seem to be more at risk for a 125 severe course of Covid-19 disease. Interestingly, a recent report from Wuhan indicated that126 none of the patients included in a sample of 140 patients affected by Covid-19 had asthma 127 or allergic rhinitis (Ref. E1); therefore, the severity level of the Covid-19 disease could not be 128 assessed in this particular group. 129 Particularly interesting is the course of the olfactory disorder. Before the treatment with 130 dupilumab, the patient had respiratory anosmia caused by the obstruction of the olfactory 131 region by nasal polyps. A significant recovery of olfactory function occurred already after the 132 second dose of dupilumab. Anosmia was the first sign of COVID-19 infection in the absence 133 of other typical symptoms. After the patient's recovery, she regained the function of the 134 olfactory system. Interestingly, anosmia is described as occurring in up to two-thirds of 135 COVID-19 patients in the affected countries (Ref. E2, Ref. E3). The patients report a sudden 136 onset of almost complete loss of the olfactory function. However, so far, this has only been 137 determined while collecting patients' medical history and not through validated smell tests. 138 The pathomechanism of the olfactory dysfunction during COVID-19 infection is not yet 139 known. Nevertheless, a newly occurring olfactory disorder should be assessed as an essential 140 symptom of COVID-19, and the patients affected by anosmia should be regarded as 141 infectious until tested for COVID-19. 142 In summary, we delivered the first piece of evidence supporting the view that patients with 143 severe CRSwNP can continue to be treated with dupilumab during the COVID-19 infection. 144 Emerging information about the course of SARS-CoV-2 / Covid-19 in CRSwNP patients should 145 further facilitate the decision-making process about the continuation of therapy S, Slack R, Lund VJ, Browne JP.
