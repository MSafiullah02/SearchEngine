During a 2-year longitudinal study of viruses associated with CIRD at a rescue center in the United Kingdom, CHV was found in 12.8% of the tracheal samples examined and in 9.6% of the lung samples. Infections with CHV were seen 3 to 4 weeks after entry and were associated with more severe respiratory signs.18 The delay in detection of the virus by PCR was corroborated by the serologic data, which also indicated that CHV infections occurred at a later time point. A possible explanation offered for its detection in more severe cases was the possibility that latent CHV could have been reactivated as a result of the stress induced by a primary CIRD episode that was triggered by other viral or bacterial agents. The virus source was not determined. The authors speculated that genetically different CHV strains would have been detected if the source of virus was the result of reactivation of latent virus from different dogs. It has been reported, however, that CHV strains show very low sequence variability.41\n",

The authors concluded that while CHV contributed to the CIRD, it was not an obligate pathogen in that environment, since some asymptomatic dogs also seroconverted.",

Punctate keratitis is the earliest detectable CHV corneal ulceration and appears clinically as a fine stippling of epithelial loss. This subtle lesion is often clinically overlooked when examination is performed without the aid of magnification, but application of corneal vital stains (particularly rose Bengal or lissamine green) facilitate detection.47 As punctate ulcerations progress, they form the classic alphaherpesvirus corneal lesion of dendritic corneal ulcers. Dendritic corneal ulcerations are strongly suggestive of CHV infection in the dog. These linear, branching ulcers stain brightly with sodium fluorescein, rose Bengal, and lissamine green (Fig. 6).\n7, 47 Prominent terminal end bulbs are a consistent feature of CHV dendritic ulcers in the dog and can be used to differentiate CHV corneal lesions from other potential causes of linear corneal ulcers that might appear clinically similar (eg, external trauma, cilia abnormalities, entropion). Terminal end bulbs are club-shaped, rounded ends to the CHV dendritic ulcer branches, and are not seen with other causes of linear corneal ulcers. Coalescence of dendritic ulcerations may result in the formation of geographic corneal ulcers.47 These appear as larger, irregular-shaped areas of corneal epithelial loss. In dogs with CHV ulcerative keratitis, corneal ulcers are commonly located in discrete groups or linear arrangements on the corneal surface. Unless complicated by secondary bacterial infection, CHV corneal ulcers remain superficial and corneal stromal loss is not appreciable. Nonulcerative keratitis is a less frequent lesion reported with CHV ocular infection.47 Clinically, nonulcerative keratitis appears as a circumferential ring of cornea stromal neovascularization with epithelial and subepithelial leukocyte infiltrates in the peripheral cornea. Nonulcerative keratitis may represent a resolution stage of active corneal epithelial disease.",

The mean duration of detectable ocular disease was 8.6 days and was shorter than the experimental primary ocular CHV infection in the dogs. Cellular lesions observed by in vivo confocal microscopy in the dogs included conjunctival leukocyte infiltrates, corneal leukocyte infiltrates, abnormal corneal epithelial cell morphologies, and corneal Langerhans cell infiltrates.

Viral shedding and recurrent CHV ocular disease were not detected; however, crystalline corneal opacities developed in some dogs. These bilateral corneal lesions appeared clinically as subepithelial and anterior stromal punctate, white, refractile opacities within the central cornea.

Interestingly, infection of the VG or VL was not always associated with infection of TG.

The tissues most commonly found to be positive were lumbosacral ganglia, tonsil, parotid salivary gland, and liver. Based on the data, lumbosacral ganglia are an important site of latency and potential source of reactivated virus for venereal infections and infection of pups as they pass through the birth canal. Finding of latent virus in tonsils and salivary glands points to the role of oronasal spread in the transmission of CHV. It was noted that viral DNA was detected in the trigeminal ganglia extracts of only 2 of the dogs. None of the 12 blood samples tested were found to be positive, indicting a lack of detectable viremia. The authors commented that CHV is either totally absent from peripheral blood or that the level of infection is limited to 1 genomic copy per 2000 mononuclear cells.

The serologic data clearly indicate that CHV was circulating in this kennel in the form of acute and/or reactivated form, primary infections. However, despite the fact that samples were taken at regular intervals, the results of PCR testing with a previously validated assay were uniformly negative both on all nasal and vaginal swabs and buffy coat samples.

Corticosteroid also lead to host immune response suppression, As discussed by the authors, the immunosuppression could be involved directly in the reactivation event, or indirectly in facilitating the spread of reactivated virus to peripheral tissues, leading to renewed replication at peripheral mucosal sites and potential transmission to susceptible animals that are in contact with the animal in which reactivation takes place.",

When paraffin-embedded tissues are used for PCR, it has to be kept in mind that the quality of the DNA can be affected by several factors, such as the length of time between tissue removal and fixation, the presence of nucleases in the tissue, and the length of storage of the paraffin blocks.",

A fluorogenic real-time PCR assay was described by Reubel and colleagues52 and reported to have a detection limit of 10 copies of viral DNA. The first probe-based multiplex real-time PCR for CHV was reported by Ledbetter and colleagues.8 Very recently, Decaro and colleagues14 reported the development and complete validation of a probe-based real-time quantitative PCR for the detection and quantitation of CHV DNA in clinical samples. The assay was found to be very sensitive, since it could detect as few as 10 copies of the target per sample. In comparison with the gel-based PCR assay described by Schulze and Baumg\u00e4rtner,17 which was used in parallel, this assay has a 10-fold lower detection limit. Specificity for CHV was very high, as determined by lack of amplification of other canine viruses. The dynamic range was validated by successful amplification of a number of CHV-positive samples from different geographic locations. Reproducibility of the assay was determined by determining both intra-assay and interassay variability between the results obtained with samples containing variable amounts of target DNA. Both intra-assay and interassay variability, expressed as a coefficient of variation, were fairly low, were dependent on the target concentration, and were found to increase with decreasing target copy numbers. A potential pitfall of PCR assays is that the sample contains substances that are inhibiting the reaction, thus potentially leading to false-negative results. To control for this possibility, an internal control construct was spiked into each sample at known quantity and co-amplified. This way, any inhibition would be readily detectable from a decrease in the expected signal resulting from the amplification of this internal control. A relatively simple way to avoid inhibition was to prepare a 10-fold dilution of the sample.",

According to Povey, a carrier animal may or may not shed virus in excretions or secretions, and shedding may occur continuously or intermittently.53 As was noted in the preceding section, latency in its strict definition is the lack of viral transcription and translation, so no mature virus is being produced. A latently infected dog with CHV would be defined as a carrier dog that is not shedding virus and would not be contagious to in-contact, susceptible dogs. Exacerbation of the latent state to a replicative state would result in virus replication and shedding. The dog may have mild to severe clinical symptoms during this exacerbation phase.",

While the costs of CHV-associated reproductive diseases have not been reported, it would be conceivable that a dam that loses an entire litter to CHV would result in a loss of $10,000, since multiple puppies are involved.

This has been a key factor in understanding the virus and controlling it. The virus maintains itself in subclinical carrier dogs by way of latency. It may be exacerbated throughout life by stress, which results in mild to severe clinical symptoms that most commonly affect the respiratory and ocular systems. Concurrent with these clinical episodes there is shedding from excretions and secretions to susceptible dogs. The 2 most susceptible age groups are pregnant CHV na\u00efve dogs and puppies of these dams (in utero, postnatal).",

Elevating the environmental temperature of dogs in a litter after CHV infection is diagnosed may provide some protection to uninfected pups. Viral replication is reduced at elevated body temperatures and there are lower morbidity and mortality rates in dogs that are subsequently infected; however, this is ineffective for individual dogs if implemented after viral infection.23 Intraperitoneal injection of immune sera obtained from CHV-seropositive dogs is described as a method to reduce mortality in an exposed litter, but it must be administered prior to infection to be most effective.26 Lactoferrin possesses in vitro antiviral activity against CHV and inhibits cellular infection.56 Administration of lactoferrin to dogs at risk for infection could theoretically provide protection; however, this is not demonstrated in vivo. Isolated reports of apparently successful therapy of neonatal CHV infection with the antivirals vidarabine and acyclovir are described.

Unless complicated by secondary bacterial infection, these conditions are typically self-limiting and specific antiviral therapy is not reported. In contrast to respiratory and genital infection, there are detailed reports of the successful clinical management of ocular CHV infection. In addition to nonspecific treatments to prevent secondary bacterial infection (topical ocular antimicrobials) and improve comfort (topical ocular atropine), antiviral therapy with 0.1% idoxuridine or 1% trifluridine ophthalmic solution was used. Idoxuridine and trifluridine are nucleoside analogues, possess good anti-herpesvirus activity, and are well tolerated by dogs when applied topically as ocular formulations. Trifluridine is available under the trade name Viroptic, and idoxuridine can be acquired from compounding pharmacies. Both antivirals are administered 6 to 8 times daily for the first 48 hours and then 4 times daily until resolution of clinical signs of active infection. Cidofovir 0.5% ophthalmic solution is an alternative ophthalmic antiviral for CHV ocular disease that is effective with twice daily administration (E.C. Ledbetter, unpublished data, 2011).",
