Microarray binding experiments using an extensive heparan sulfate (HS) oligosaccharide library showed the spike of SARS-CoV-2 can bind HS in a length-and sequence-dependent manner. Hexa-and octasaccharides composed of IdoA2S-GlcNS6S repeating units were identified as optimal ligands. Surface plasma resonance (SPR) showed the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds with higher affinity to heparin (KD 55 nM) compared to the receptor binding domain (RBD, KD 1 \u00b5M) alone. An octasaccharide composed of IdoA2S-GlcNS6S could inhibit spike-heparin interaction with an IC50 of 38 nM. Our data supports a model in which the RBD of the spike of SARS-CoV-2 confers sequence specificity for HS expressed by target cells whereas an additional HS binding site in the S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage site enhances the avidity of binding. Collectively, our results highlight the potential of using HS oligosaccharides as a therapeutic agent by inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 binding to target cells.",

            "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic demands the urgent development of therapeutic strategies. An attractive approach is to interfere in the attachment of the virus to the host cell. The entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells is initiated by binding of the transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein of the virus to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of the host. 1 SARS-CoV is closely related to SARS-CoV-2 and employs the same receptor. 2 The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is comprised of two subunits; S1 is responsible for binding to the host receptor, whereas S2 promotes membrane fusion. The C terminal domain (CTD) of S1 harbors the receptor binding domain (RBD). 3 It is known that the spike protein of number of human coronaviruses can bind to a secondary receptor, or co-receptor, to facilitate cell entry. For example, MERS-CoV employs sialic acid as co-receptor along its main receptor DPP4. 4 Human CoV-NL63, which also utilizes ACE2 as receptor, uses heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans, as coreceptor. 5 It has also been shown that entry of SARS-CoV pseudo-typed virus into Vero E6 and Caco-2 cells can significantly be inhibited by heparin or treatment with heparinase, indicating the importance of HS for infectivity. 6 There are indications that the SARS-CoV-2 spike also interacts with HS. One reports showed that heparin can induce a conformation change in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. 7 A combined SPR and computational study showed that glycosaminoglycans can bind to the proteolytic cleavage site of the S1 and S2 protein. 8 HS are highly complex O-and N-sulfated polysaccharides that reside as major components on the cell surface and extracellular matrix of all eukaryotic cells. 9 Various proteins interact with HS thereby regulating many biological and disease processes, including cell adhesion, proliferation, differentiation and inflammation. They are also used by many viruses, including herpes simplex virus (HSV), Dengue virus, HIV, and various coronaviruses, as receptor or co-receptor. [10] [11] [12] The biosynthesis of HS is highly regulated and the length and degree and pattern of sulfation of HS can differ substantially between different cell types. The so-called \"HS sulfate code hypothesis\" is based on the notion that expression of specific HS epitopes by cells makes it possible to recruit specific HS-binding proteins, thereby controlling a multitude of biological processes. [13] [14] In support of this hypothesis, several studies have shown that HS binding proteins exhibit preferences for specific HS oligosaccharide motifs. [15] [16] Therefore, we were compelled to investigate whether the spike of SARS-CoV-2 recognizes specific HS motifs. Such insight is expected to pave the way to develop inhibitors of viral cell binding and entry.",

Thus, the spike protein (150 nM) or RBD (2.4 \u00b5M) were pre-mixed with different concentrations of compound 81 and then used as analytes. The IC50 values were determined by non-linear fitting of Log(inhibitor) vs. response using variable slope (Fig. 3) . The IC50 values for the spike protein and RBD are 38 nM and 264 nM, respectively, showing compound 81 is a potent competitive inhibitor of the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike with heparin.",

Removal of the sulfate at C-3 of N-sulfoglucosamine (GlcNS3S) of the pentasaccharide results in a 10 5 -fold reduction in binding affinity. 25 Importantly, such a functionality is not present in the identified HS ligand of SARS-CoV-2 spike, and therefore compounds can be developed that can inhibit cell binding, but do not interact with ATIII. As a result, such preparations can be used at higher doses without causing adverse side effects. Our data also shows that multivalent interactions of the spike with HS results in high avidity of binding.",

            "text": "Compounds showing strong responsiveness (77, 78, 79, and 81) are composed of trisulfated repeating units (IdoA2S-GlcNS6S). The binding is length-dependent and HS oligosaccharide 81 (IdoA2S-GlcNS6S)4 and 79 (IdoA2S-GlcNS6S)3 having four and three repeating units, respectively, showed the strongest binding. On the other hand, tetrasaccharide 57 (IdoA2S-GlcNS6S)2, which has the same repeating unit structure, gave a very low responsiveness. A similar observation was made for disaccharide 4 (IdoA2S-GlcNS6S). The structure-binding data shows that perturbations in the backbone or sulfation pattern lead to substantial reductions in binding. The importance of the IdoA2S residue is highlighted by comparing hexasaccharides 79 with 77 in which a single IdoA2S in the distal disaccharide repeating unit is replaced with GlcA. This modification lead to a substantial reduction in responsiveness. Further replacements of IdoA2S with GlcA in compound 77 completely abolish binding, as evident for compounds 70, 68, and 62. The structure-activity data also showed that the 2-O-sulfates are crucial, and binding was lost when such functionalities were not present (77 vs. 71, 69, and 65). Lack of one or more 6-O-sulfates also resulted in substantial reductions in binding (77 vs. 72 and 66). Although the SARS-CoV-2 spike and RBD showed similar selectivities, the binding of the spike appeared stronger and much higher fluorescent readings were observed at the same protein concentration. To validate the microarray results, binding experiments were performed by surface plasma resonances (SPR). Biotinylated heparin was immobilized on a streptavidin-coated sensor chip and binding experiments were performed with different concentrations of the spike protein and RBD. Representative sensorgrams are shown in Fig. 2. KD values of 55 nM and 1.0 \u00b5M were determined using a 1:1 Langmuir binding model for the spike and RBD, respectively. A previous reported computational study indicated that in addition to",

It suggests that non-coagulating heparin or HS preparations can be developed that reduce cell binding and infectivity without a risk of causing bleeding. In this respect, administration of heparin requires great care because its anticoagulant activity can result in excessive bleeding. Antithrombin III (ATIII), which confers anticoagulant activity, binds a specific pentasaccharide GlcNAc(6S)-GlcA-GlcNS(3S)(6S)-IdoA2S-GlcNS(6S) embedded in HS or heparin.",

Individual samples were dissolved in sodium phosphate buffer (50 \u00b5L, 0.225 M, pH 8.5) at a concentration of 100 \u00b5M and were printed in replicates of 10 with spot volume ~ 400 pL, at 20 \u00b0C and 50% humidity. Each slide has 24 subarrays in a 3x8 layout. After printing, slides were incubated in a humidity chamber for 8 h and then blocked for 30 min with a 5mM ethanolamine in a Tris buffer (pH 9.0, 50 mM) at 40 \u00b0C. Blocked slides were rinsed with DI water, spun dry, and kept in a desiccator at room temperature for future use.Screening was performed by incubating the slides with a protein solution for a certainamount of time followed by washing and drying. A typical washing procedure includes sequentially dipping the glass slide in TSM wash buffer (2 min, containing 0.05 % Tween 20), TSM buffer (2 min) and, water (2 x 2 min), followed by spun dry. For SARS-CoV-2-RBD and SARS-CoV-2-Spike protein screening, the slides were incubated with SARS-CoV-2-RBD (10, 30, and 100 \u00b5g/mL in TSMBB) or SARS-CoV-2-Spike (3, 10, and 30 \u00b5g/mL in TSMBB) for 1 h, followed by washing and incubated with a solution of AlexaFluor\u00ae 647 conjugated anti-His antibody (10 \u00b5g/mL). After washing and drying, the slides were scanned using a GenePix 4000B microarray scanner (Molecular Devices) at the appropriate excitation wavelength with a resolution of 5 \u00b5M. Various gains and PMT values were employed for the scanning to ensure that all the signals were within the linear range of the scanner's detector and there was no saturation of signals. The images were analyzed using GenePix Pro 7 software (version 7.2.29.2, Molecular Devices). The data was analyzed with our home written Excel macro to provide the results. The highest and the lowest value of the total fluorescence intensity of the replicates spots were removed, and the remaining values were used to provide the mean value and standard deviation. Preparation of biotinylated heparin High grade heparin (HG-Hep, Mw 15,700, Iduron, UK) was biotinylated following a literature procedure. 26 Briefly, HG-Hep (0.5 mg), biotin-(PEG)3-NH2 (0.5 mg, Thermo Scientific, USA) and sodium cyanoborohydride (2.5 mg, NaBH3CN, AminoLink\u2122 reductant, Thermo Scientific, USA) were combined, dissolved in water (100 \u00b5L) and stirred at 70 \u00b0C for 24 h. Another portion of NaBH3CN (2.5 mg) was added and stirring continued for additional 24 h. To remove excess of biotin linker and reductant, the reaction mixture was filter centrifuged (Mw cutoff 3000) and exchanged with water (2x1 mL, Milli-Q\u00ae), concentrated (200 \u00b5L) and lyophilized to obtain the desired Biotin-HG-Hep as white fluffy powder. The product was aliquoted and stored at -80 \u00b0C.Surface plasma resonances experimentsA streptavidin coated chip was prepared from a CM5 chip by standard amine coupling using an amine coupling kit (Biacore Inc. -GE Healthcare). Briefly, the surface was activated using freshly mixed N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS; 100 mM) and 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC; 391 mM) (1/1, v/v) in water. The remaining active esters were quenched by aqueous ethanolamine (1.0 M; pH 8.5). Next, streptavidin (50 \u03bcg/mL) in aqueous NaOAc (10 mM, pH 4.5) was passed over the chip surface until a ligand density of approximately 3,000 RU was achieved. Next, biotin-HG-Hep (1 \u03bcM) was passed over one of the flow channels at a flow rate of 5 \u03bcL/min for two min resulting in a response of 56 RU. Next, the reference and modified flow cells were washed with three consecutive injections of 1 min with 1 M NaCl in 50 mM NaOH. HBS-EP (0.01 M HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% polysorbate 20; pH 7.4) was used as the running buffer for the immobilization, kinetic studies of the interaction of HG-Hep with SARS-CoV-2-RBD and spike protein (S1+S2), and inhibition studies of immobilized HG-Hep with synthetic GAGs oligosaccharides. Analytes were dissolved in running buffer and a flow rate of 30\u00b5L/min was employed for association and dissociation at a constant temperature of 25 o C. A 60 s injection of 0.25% sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS) at a flow rate of 30 \u00b5l/min was used for regeneration and to achieve prior baseline status. Using Biacore T100 evaluation software, the response curves of various analyte concentrations were globally fitted to the 1:1 binding model.
