            "text": "Anterior uveitis or iridocyclitis involves inflammation of the iris and ciliary body. Although iritis implies inflammation of the iris only, it often is used synonymously with anterior uveitis. Intermediate uveitis, also referred to as pars planitis, involves predominantly the posterior portion of the ciliary body, the pars plana. Strictly speaking, posterior uveitis is inflammation of the choroid (choroiditis), but because the retina usually is affected concurrently, chorioretinitis is a more accurate term. Because the anterior and posterior uveal tissues are parts of a continuum, inflammation commonly occurs in both simultaneously. Panuveitis is the term used when the entire uveal tract is inflamed.",

Most exogenous causes are from trauma to the eye, including blunt, penetrating, and surgical trauma that may or may not include infection or corneal ulceration. Endogenous uveitis may be parasitic, infectious, neoplastic, immune-mediated, or idiopathic. Infectious agents that have been associated with development of uveitis in cats can be found in Table 3-1\n. Between 253 and 90 per cent4 of cases of uveitis in cats have been reported to be associated with clinical or serological evidence of infectious disease. The most common infectious diseases associated with uveitis are toxoplasmosis, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and feline leukemia virus (FeLV).",

            "text": "As with other tissues, intraocular inflammation is initiated by local tissue injury (e.g., trauma, infectious agent, antigen challenge). Tissue factors and chemoattractants are released from damaged tissue and microorganisms; vasodilation and changes in vascular permeability follow. These changes indicate disruption of the blood-ocular barrier. Inflammatory mediators, released by damaged tissue cells, cause leukocyte activation and migration. Because the globe has no lymphatic drainage, antigens from degraded organisms are transported to the spleen or other lymphoid tissue via the venous system to activate antigen-specific T and B lymphocytes. Immunocompetent T and B lymphocytes then migrate back to the eye and reside in the uvea.5 Factors believed to help stop the immune response include elimination of the inciting antigen and production of inhibitory cytokines by T and B lymphocytes.6 If the inciting antigen cannot be removed completely, as in autoimmune disease, chronic inflammation results. Some proposed mechanisms that contribute to development of autoimmune uveitis include (1) abnormal induction of tolerance to autoantigens, (2) release of normally sequestered autoantigens resulting from trauma or infection, (3) molecular mimicry (homology between pathogens and host tissue antigens), and (4) alteration of autoantigen structure resulting from tissue injury or inflammation.5, 7, 8 Because uvea contains immunocompetent lymphocytes, chronic or recurrent inflammation also could result from specific or nonspecific activation of lymphocytes by non-self antigens.9 The clinician must impress upon the client that even with an exhaustive diagnostic evaluation, a specific cause for uveitis may not be found. The client should understand that, regardless of the inciting cause, uveitis may become chronic, treatment may be palliative, and adverse sequelae are common.",

Ocular pain, manifested by photophobia, blepharospasm, enophthalmos, elevation of the third eyelid, and/or epiphora, is common with acute anterior uveitis but may be absent when chronic. Reddened sclera, caused by injection of conjunctival and episcleral vessels, and aqueous flare are the hallmarks of anterior uveitis. Aqueous flare is caused by increased protein concentration in the aqueous humor and is secondary to disruption of the blood-ocular barrier. Light passing through the anterior chamber is scattered in aqueous flare, and if severe, the aqueous humor appears cloudy. Corneal edema can result from the effects of inflammation on the corneal endothelium. As edema increases, the cornea becomes increasingly opaque and blue. Inflammatory cells in the aqueous humor may be deposited on the internal surface of the corneal endothelium as keratic precipitates (KPs). Normal convection currents in the aqueous humor cause KPs to be located primarily on the ventral half of the cornea. Keratic precipitates vary in size. Larger KPs are seen more often with granulomatous inflammatory processes associated with diseases such as FIP and toxoplasmosis (Figure 3-1\n).",

            "text": "The iris undergoes many changes with anterior uveitis. Inflammatory mediators, in particular prostaglandins, cause miosis by a direct effect on the iris sphincter. Very mild miosis is difficult to detect, so its absence should not be used to rule out uveitis. Iritis, manifested by iris vasodilation and increased iris vessel permeability, often causes a subtle to pronounced iris color change. On close examination, dilated iris vessels may be obvious, and the iris may appear swollen and have a thin coat of fibrin and cells giving it a velvet-like texture. As anterior uveitis becomes more chronic, the pupil margin may begin to form posterior synechiae (adhesions to the anterior lens capsule), which give the pupil an irregular shape and impair its ability to respond to light or dilating agents (Figure 3-2\n). If extensive posterior synechiae develop, aqueous humor cannot move from the posterior chamber to the anterior chamber. Aqueous humor then accumulates behind the iris and causes it to billow forward, a condition known as iris bomb\u00e9. Because access to the anterior chamber is required for aqueous humor to reach the filtration angle, iris bomb\u00e9 is associated with increasing intraocular pressure and glaucoma. Peripheral anterior synechiae (adhesions of the peripheral iris to the cornea) can form with anterior uveitis as a result of iris bomb\u00e9 or secondary to iris swelling and inflammation. Inflammatory cells, iris swelling, and anterior synechiae also can impair aqueous outflow and contribute to the development of secondary glaucoma.",

Because of their close apposition, retinal inflammation often accompanies inflammation of the choroid, which creates chorioretinitis. Changes in the ocular fundus secondary to chorioretinitis are related to the breakdown of the blood-ocular barrier, located at the retinal blood vessels and the retinal pigment epithelium. Increased permeability of these barriers allows components of the blood to accumulate within and between the choroid and retina. Migration of inflammatory cells to the area of inflammation also occurs. Clinically, retinal and subretinal fluid exudes, and hemorrhage can be detected. Because the retina and subretinal space overlie the tapetum, tapetal reflectivity is diminished or obscured by areas of active chorioretinitis (Figure 3-3\n). Severe chorioretinitis can lead to partial or complete retinal detachment and decreased vision or blindness. Inflammation of both the anterior and posterior uvea is termed endophthalmitis.",

To perform paracentesis, a 25-, 27-, or 30-gauge needle on a 1- or 3-ml syringe; small rat-toothed forceps; adequate lighting; and magnification are needed. The bulbar conjunctiva and cornea are flushed gently with a 1:20 povidone-iodine and sterile saline solution. Povidone-iodine soap should not be used because it irritates the cornea and conjunctiva. The globe should be grasped with forceps at the dorsolateral limbus. The needle should enter the eye at the limbus and parallel to the iris plane. The globe will be most stable if the needle enters the eye immediately adjacent to the hold of the forceps. Care should be taken to keep the needle bevel up and the tip away from the iris and lens (Figure 3-4\n). Up to 0.3 ml of aqueous humor usually can be removed slowly without collapsing the anterior chamber. After withdrawing the needle, gentle pressure is applied to the centesis site using a moistened cotton swab. Samples of aqueous humor can be dropped directly onto a swab for culture and sensitivity, or stored in a sterile container (such as a red top tube) for antigen, DNA, or antibody measurement techniques. Cytological examination is best performed on samples stored in a 1.5-ml blood collection tube that contains ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), concentrated by centrifugation, and stained with DifQuick or Wright's stain. Substrate requirements for PCR and real time-PCR (RT-PCR) assays vary by the assay; many can be performed on frozen samples. Clinicians should contact the appropriate laboratory for transport instructions. Indications for aqueous humor paracentesis are found in Table 3-2\n. Mild hyphema is the most common complication of aqueous humor paracentesis. Serious complications are rare if care is taken to avoid inadvertent contact with the iris or lens, if no more than 0.3 ml of fluid is removed, and if aqueous humor is aspirated slowly.",

However, vitreous paracentesis generally is reserved for blind or nearly blind eyes because of the potential for causing severe ocular hemorrhage, retinal tear, and retinal detachment. General anesthesia is recommended. Before aspiration, the bulbar conjunctiva is cleaned gently with 1:20 povidone-iodine and sterile saline solution to remove all mucus and debris. The dorsolateral globe is grasped 6 to 7 mm behind the limbus with small, toothed forceps. Vitreous is viscous and can be difficult to aspirate, so a 3-ml syringe is needed for adequate suction. Aspiration through a 25-gauge needle can be attempted first, but a 22-gauge needle often is needed to obtain a sufficient sample for analysis. The needle should be aimed toward the center of the globe and should be introduced into the eye 7 to 9 mm posterior to the limbus, adjacent to the forceps for maximal stabilization (Figure 3-5\n). If a mass is present, the needle can be guided by ultrasound into the mass for aspiration. If the ocular media are clear, the needle can be guided visually with use of indirect ophthalmoscopy. Care should be taken not to advance the needle into the opposite retina and choroid. Slightly altering the needle position may help if aspirating fluid is difficult. If bacterial endophthalmitis is suspected and a vitreous injection of antibiotic is planned, the syringe should be removed and the needle left in place for injection. Vitreous samples should be handled the same as aqueous humor samples for culture, cytology, PCR assays, or RT-PCR assays (see Table 3-2).",

Failure to control inflammation can lead to posterior synechiae, glaucoma, cataracts, retinal detachment, vitreous degeneration, optic nerve atrophy, and retinal degeneration.

Anterior uveitis usually is treated topically10 a minimum of every 4 to 6 hours and as frequently as every 2 hours, depending on the severity of inflammation. Aggressive treatment is continued until the inflammation is controlled, and then the frequency of administration should be tapered slowly. If inflammation is not controlled, or if frequent treatments are not possible, supplementation with oral GC should be considered. Topical preparations with the best potency and corneal penetration are prednisolone acetate suspension (1 per cent), and dexamethasone solution (0.1 per cent) or ointment (0.05 per cent).11 Topical GC are contraindicated in the presence of corneal ulceration because they inhibit wound healing and augment collagenase activity in the cornea.12 Systemic administration of GC has minimal corneal effects unless the cornea is heavily vascularized; therefore they can be administered if concurrent corneal ulceration and anterior uveitis exist.13\n",

Topical 1 per cent atropine sulfate ointment is used most commonly, because the ocular solution is more likely to reach the mouth via the nasolacrimal duct and cause profuse salivation as a result of its bitter taste. The duration and frequency of application depend on the severity of ocular inflammation. Very mild inflammation usually is treated only once daily; severe inflammation may require treatment up to three to four times daily to maintain iris dilatation. Because parasympatholytics can cause decreased tear production, they are generally applied until the pupil dilates and then are discontinued until the pupil begins to constrict. The addition of a sympathomimetic agent may help to achieve mydriasis when synechiae have formed already (see Table 3-3).22\n",

Because cats often become infected by carnivorism, a history of ingesting undercooked meat or hunting activity is common. Acute, polysystemic illness associated with toxoplasmosis is uncommon; fever and hyperesthesia possibly related to muscle inflammation are the most common systemic signs.23 The actual prevalence of ocular toxoplasmosis is unknown. Many cats with uveitis and positive T. gondii serology have no other clinical evidence of disease. When available, ocular histopathology on these cases rarely identifies the organism,3, 25 which makes it difficult to correlate positive serology with ocular infection. This is especially true because many commercial laboratory tests for\nT. gondii detect only serum IgG levels. IgG antibodies develop approximately 2 weeks post infection and may remain elevated for years, even in healthy animals.26 A rising IgG titer (fourfold increase over 2 to 3 weeks) indicates recent or active infection and correlates better with disease. Alternatively, the presence of serum IgM against T. gondii can be used as an indication of recent infection, because IgM usually is not detectable 9 weeks post infection.27\n",

Trimethoprim-sulfonamide combination therapy (15 mg/kg PO q12h for 2 to 4 weeks) also can be used for treatment of toxoplasmosis, although it is less suitable because of the potential side effects caused by folic acid deficiency in cats. Frequent monitoring for mental depression, anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia is required, especially if treatment is longer than 2 weeks.27 Azithromycin is a potential alternate choice for cats intolerant of clindamycin or sulfa drugs; however, the most appropriate dose for the treatment of toxoplasmosis has not been determined.

Ocular disease accompanied by ascites, thoracic or pericardial effusion, depression, icterus, renal failure, diarrhea, or neurological signs is suggestive of FIP. Ocular lesions are seen most often with the noneffusive or dry form of FIP. Anterior and/or posterior uveitis may be present. Iritis, large keratic precipitates, and clots of fibrin and blood in the anterior chamber are found commonly, along with cuffing of the retinal vasculature and chorioretinitis. Similar to toxoplasmosis, confirming a diagnosis of FIP can be challenging. Studies have shown 25 per cent of household pets and 80 per cent or more of cattery-reared cats carry serum antibodies against feline coronavirus.31 Current serodiagnostic tests cannot distinguish between antibodies against pathogenic or nonpathogenic coronaviruses.34, 35, 36 Therefore diagnosis usually is based on the combination of clinical signs, physical examination findings, and laboratory evaluation. High serum globulin (<5.1 g/dl), low albumin:globulin ratio, and effusion total protein content greater than 3.5 g/dl also are supportive. Although a high coronavirus antibody titer also is supportive, it does not correlate with disease as well as hyperglobulinemia or low albumin:globulin ratio.34, 37, 38 RT-PCR tests on blood are not useful in the diagnosis of FIP because nonpathogenic coronaviruses can be found in the serum or plasma of normal cats.38, 39 Detection of coronavirus RNA in tissues, effusions, or aqueous humor by RT-PCR assay may correlate with the presence of FIP; however, nonpathogenic coronavirus also can be found in the tissues of normal cats.38\n",

Conversely, a negative FeLV test does not rule out LSA, because 20 to 70 per cent of cats with confirmed LSA are FeLV-negative.45 The ELISA for detection of the p27 antigen in the blood is the most widely used, commercially available screening test for FeLV.

Because ELISA testing occasionally produces false-positive results, all positive tests should be confirmed with Western blot immunoassay. As an additional confounding factor, antibodies induced by a commercially available FIV vaccine (Fel-O-Vax, Fort Dodge Laboratories) cannot be distinguished from those induced by natural infection on any presently available FIV antibody test, so the vaccination status of all cats with uveitis must be determined.

Fleas transmit the organism, so the incidence of infection is highest in areas with a warm, humid climate that are highly endemic for Ctenocephalides felis. The majority of naturally infected or experimentally infected cats show no clinical evidence of disease, but transient fever, lymphadenopathy, stomatitis, and neurological signs have been reported65 (see Chapter 4). Bartonella spp. was suggested as a likely cause of anterior uveitis in one cat based on presence of Bartonella spp. antibody production in aqueous humor and a clinical response to doxycycline.66\nBartonella spp. aqueous antibody production was evident in seven of 49 cats with uveitis, but in zero of 49 healthy cats in another study.67 In that study, three of 24 cats with uveitis and one of 49 healthy cats had Bartonella spp. DNA in aqueous humor detected by PCR.

The intraocular pressure (IOP) of an eye with glaucoma secondary to anterior uveitis may be in the normal range because of the simultaneous decrease in aqueous humor production and outflow. Measurement of IOP should be performed on all patients with anterior uveitis. The development of secondary glaucoma should be suspected when IOP is greater than 10 mm Hg in an eye with anterior uveitis, and the eye should be monitored closely for increasing IOP. Glaucoma is treated best with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and beta-blockers to decrease aqueous humor production. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can be administered orally (dichlorphenamide 0.5 to 1.5 mg/kg q12h to q8h or methazolamide 3 to 4 mg/kg q12h) or topically (dorzolamide or brinzolamide q8h). Systemic side effects (vomiting, diarrhea, panting, depression, potassium depletion) are less likely with topical treatment. Timolol, betaxolol, carteolol, levobunolol, and metipranolol are topical beta adrenergic blocking agents and are administered q12h.
