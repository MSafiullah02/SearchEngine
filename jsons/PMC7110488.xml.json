Lastly, the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Korea was caused by a single traveller waiting in an overcrowded hospital emergency room in South Korea.8 The Korean MERS-CoV outbreak illustrates how difficult it is to predict the future. MERS was estimated to have a low epidemic potential,9 and it was pointed out in this Journal that the outbreak was identified as being caused by MERS-CoV because it happened in a country with the resources (knowledge and laboratory facilities) to rapidly identify the virus.10\n",

Several studies have looked at carrier rates of Neisseria meningitidis in Hajj pilgrims, and overall carriage rates of 5\u201310% were found, comparable to the rate found in populations in non-epidemic settings.21 In 2000 and 2001, 338 and 316 cases of laboratory-verified Neisseria meningitidis were reported; this fell dramatically to 2\u20134 cases per year (2013\u20132015) following the introduction of mandatory immunization with the quadrivalent vaccine.22 The quadrivalent ACWY polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine has been a visa requirement for Hajj and Umrah since 2002. At the same time the Saudi authorities introduced a vaccination programme for children and adults living in Mecca and Medina, healthcare workers, and government personnel serving the pilgrims.23\n",

A review in this issue discusses the need for vaccines for mass gatherings and draws attention to immunization against pneumococcal infections in elderly pilgrims and highlights that polio may be a risk.27 An important vaccine for Hajj pilgrims, and the Arabian Peninsula in general, is one against MERS-CoV. The engineering of live attenuated vaccines has been facilitated by the development of reverse genetics. Using one of these methodologies, viruses deleted in the small envelope (E) protein have been developed. These viruses have been attenuated and have induced protective humoral and cell-based immune responses in hamsters and mice after SARS-CoV challenge.28\n",
