            "text": "Background: Respiratory viruses are associated with a huge socio-economic burden and are responsible for a large proportion of acute respiratory illness in hospitalised adults. Laboratory PCR is accurate but takes at least 24 h to generate a result to clinicians and antigen-based point-of-care tests (POCT) lack sensitivity. Rapid molecular platforms, such as the FilmArray Respiratory Panel, have equivalent diagnostic accuracy to laboratory PCR and can generate a result in 1 h making them deployable as POCT. Molecular point-of-care testing for respiratory viruses in hospital has the potential to improve the detection rate of respiratory viruses, improve the use of influenza antivirals and reduce unnecessary antibiotic use, but high quality randomised trials with clinically relevant endpoints are needed. Methods: The ResPOC study is a pragmatic randomised controlled trial of molecular point-of-care testing for respiratory viruses in adults with acute respiratory illness presenting to a large teaching hospital in the United Kingdom. Eligible participants are adults presenting with acute respiratory illness to the emergency department or the acute medicine unit. Participants are allocated 1:1 by internet-based randomisation service to either the intervention of a nose and throat swab analysed immediately on the FilmArray Respiratory Panel as a POCT or receive routine clinical care. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients treated with antibiotics. Secondary outcomes include turnaround time, virus detection, neuraminidase inhibitor use, length of hospital stay and side room use. Analysis of the primary outcome will be by intention-to-treat and all enrolled participants will be included in safety analysis.",

The influenza virus causes seasonal epidemics leading to excess hospitalisations and death mainly in the elderly and in patients with co-morbidity [3, 4] . Annual seasonal influenza vaccine is recommended in at risk groups [5] [6] [7] however vaccine coverage rate is sub-optimal [8, 9] and high quality evidence for significant protection in the elderly is lacking [10, 11] .",

            "text": "The rate of hospitalisation in adults with influenza has been estimated at 5 to 20 per 100,000 overall [12, 13] and may be as high as 1,200 per 100,000 in those over 85 years old [4] . Hospitalisation and death result from the complications of influenza including pneumonia and exacerbation of underlying cardiopulmonary conditions [14] . In adult patients hospitalised with laboratory confirmed influenza, 10-30% are admitted to critical care units and 3-15% die in hospital [15] [16] [17] with outcomes being predicted by co-morbidity [17, 18] . Estimates of the burden of influenza virus infection in hospitalised adults have traditionally been based on the incidence of the influenzalike-illness syndrome (ILI, defined as fever of >38\u00b0C and new respiratory symptoms) rather than on laboratory confirmed influenza. ILI has poor sensitivity (around 50%) and specificity (0-63%) for the diagnosis of influenza in hospitalised adults even during periods of peak activity [19] [20] [21] [22] . Where estimates of disease burden are based on laboratory confirmed influenza, laboratory testing of patients is based on clinical suspicion of influenza and is generally targeted to patients with respiratory symptoms and fever. However, in addition to acute respiratory presentations, influenza may present as decompensated cardiovascular disease, collapse or diabetic emergencies [23, 24] . For this reason many hospitalised cases of influenza are likely to remain undiagnosed. A recent Canadian study estimated that only around one in 14 ED visits due to influenza virus infection were correctly attributed to influenza [25] . It is likely, therefore, that the burden of influenza and other respiratory viruses amongst hospitalised adults and its economic impact have been underestimated. In addition to influenza viruses, other respiratory viruses including rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, human metapneumovirus and coronaviruses, cause acute exacerbations of COPD and asthma as well as other acute respiratory presentations [2] , which lead to large numbers of hospitalisations every year and significant burdens upon healthcare systems.",
