            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) is a highly contagious, acute viral disease of pigs [1]. TGE can affect pigs of all ages, but the disease severity and mortality rate are high in piglets under 2 weeks of age. The causative agent is TGE virus (TGEV), a coronavirus that primarily infects and replicates in the epithelial cells of pig intestines. Affected animals shed the virus in their feces. The disease transmission occurs primarily via fecal-oral route [2]. During an outbreak, rapid detection of TGEV in feces is very useful for implementing the disease management practices in a timely manner. Any TGEV-specific diagnostic assay must be able to differentiate it from porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), a natural mutant of TGEV with truncated spike protein and altered cell tropism towards respiratory epithelial cells [3]. PRCV mostly causes mild or subclinical respiratory disease. However, in some PRCV-infected pigs, the virus can be shed in the feces [4]. Real-time PCR-based assays are well suited for rapid, specific, and sensitive detection of viruses such as TGEV. The real-time RT-PCR assay described here is based on amplification of a conserved region of the spike protein gene of TGEV strains and detection of the amplified products using a TaqMan probe [5]. The assay, along with the RNA extraction method described here, can be established in any molecular diagnostic laboratory for detection of TGEV in pig fecal samples [6\u20138].",

In our experience, RNA extracted from pig fecal samples using the following method is suitable for TGEV detection using the real-time RT-PCR assay. Other extraction methods that produce PCR inhibitor-free RNA can also be used (see\nNote\n1). The presence of PCR inhibitors in the extracted can be monitored by using an internal control (see\nNote\n2).Prepare a 20 % (w/v) suspension of feces in DNase/RNase-free distilled water. Feces in liquid form can be used directly.Transfer 250 \u03bcl of the fecal suspension into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.Add 750 \u03bcl of TRIzol LS reagent, briefly vortex the tube for 10 s, and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.Add 200 \u03bcl of chloroform to the tube. Vortex the tube for 5 s and incubate at room temperature for 3 min.Centrifuge the tube at 12,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min.Transfer 600 \u03bcl of the top aqueous phase to a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube containing 600 \u03bcl of 70 % ethanol and mix by inverting 4\u20135 times.Transfer 700 \u03bcl of the mix to an RNeasy spin column and centrifuge at 8000 \u00d7 g for 30 s.Transfer the spin column to a new collection tube, and add the remaining mix from step 6. Centrifuge at 8000 \u00d7 g for 30 s.Place the spin column into a new collection tube. Add 700 \u03bcl of RW1 buffer to the spin column and centrifuge at 8000 \u00d7 g for 30 s.Place the spin column into a new collection tube. Add 500 \u03bcl of RPE buffer to the spin column and centrifuge at 8000 \u00d7 g for 30 s (see\nNote\n3).Repeat step 10 for a second wash of the spin column with RPE buffer.Place the spin column into a new collection tube and centrifuge at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 1 min to dry the membrane of the column.Place the spin column in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and add 30 \u03bcl of DNase/RNase-free water to the column. Incubate at room temperature for 1 min.Centrifuge at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 1 min.Discard the spin column and store the eluted RNA at 4 \u00b0C if it is used in the real-time RT-PCR assay within 12 h or at \u221220 \u00b0C if it is used after 12 h (see\nNote\n4).\n",
