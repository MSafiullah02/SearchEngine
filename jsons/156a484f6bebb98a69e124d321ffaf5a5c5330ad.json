A current pandemic is caused by novel corona virus originated from China. COVID-19 pandemic is very similar to Spanish, Hong Kong, Asian and swine influenza pandemics in terms of spreading to world by the mobilized people. Burden of pandemic is considered in terms of disease transmissibility and the growth rate of epidemic and duration of pandemic can be calculated by transmissibility characteristic. The case definition, finding out cases and first case cluster, proper treatment, sufficient stockpiles of medicine and population cooperation with the containment strategy should be considered for reduction of burden of pandemic.",

Virus was spread through Vietnam War veterans returning to the United States. Then Hong Kong flu was seen in Japan, England, Wales, Australia, and Canada in 1969 [8, 9] .

The R0 for 2009 Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) has been estimated to be between 1.4 and 1.6 [16] . Secondary attack rates in pandemic showed significant variation, i.e. estimates of 33% in children and for adults 22% in different regions. Case fatality rates were obtained from high-income countries and varied three to nine times among the studies. According to one study, people younger than 64 years accounted for 80% of these deaths. Southeast Asia and Africa had highest mortality among of the other continent [17] . After three influenza pandemics in 20thcentury, it is expected when the first pandemic will be seen in 21st century. Humankind did not encounter a new influenza pandemics but a novel corona virus pandemic (Figure) . As in pandemics in history, its spread to all over the world through people traveling between countries in two-three months. In the past, pandemics spread somewhat predictably along military passages or important trade routes, but globalization has multiplied and obscured the dominant routes. Given their sheer number, and the speed with which human and animal transmission vectors can move, there is no longer a single dominant pathway for the geographical movement and expansion of infectious diseases. Pandemics are inherently uncertain, considering experiences and preparations that we have gained from past pandemics, the epidemiologic characteristics of pandemic should be evaluated. By the way the impact of the control measures are be able to evaluate during the COVID-19 pandemic's days.",
