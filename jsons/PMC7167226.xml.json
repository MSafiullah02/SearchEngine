            "text": "There have been anecdotal reports of patients stockpiling medications.29 Unless prompt action is taken, this sudden increase in demand could have a considerable and detrimental effect on the medication supply chain. Medication shortages occur when the total supply of a medication is insufficient to meet current or projected demands at the patient-level. The reported frequency of medication shortages worldwide has been increasing in recent years and has been described as a healthcare crisis in itself.12\n,\n13 Problems with local ordering, local or national distribution, or manufacturing can all result in supply problems that can lead to regional or national shortages. The medication distribution system in Nigeria is in a state of chaos and consists of open drug markets, and the activities of patent and proprietary medicine vendors (PMV), community pharmacies, private and public hospitals, importer, distributors and wholesalers, and pharmaceutical manufacturers.14 There is growing concern because although reserves exist, China experienced a drop-off in drug production during the height of its COVID-19 outbreak, though that is leveling off.16 And India, another big supplier, has also said that it will keep some of the medications it makes on reserve.17 In one case, a drug wholesaler said that demand for over-the-counter and prescription drugs was 30\u201340% higher than the company's forecasts, which had already been adjusted to account for COVID-19. The problem has been confirmed by a number of pharmacists.15 Pharmacies can share the information of drug availabilities and its store locations online or through mobile APPs to guide patients when they need to buy medications. For patients not able to visit the pharmacy, mail order or home delivery service can be offered by working with social works, volunteers, care coordinators, or drug companies. Through close collaboration with such personnel and organizations, Chinese community pharmacies have made great achievement in ensuring adequate drug supply for community patients.18 Hand hygiene is an important part of the response to COVID-19. Washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is essential, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after coughing, sneezing, or blowing one's nose. Hand sanitizers are regulated as over-the-counter (non-prescription) drugs by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends consumers use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol (also referred to as ethanol or ethyl alcohol).19\n",

The vast majority of Americans live close to a retail or independent community based pharmacy. That proximity reduces travel to testing locations, which is an important mitigation measure. Pharmacists also have strong relationships with medical providers and hospitals to appropriately refer patients when necessary.25 HHS Secretary Alex Azar issued the following statement: \u201cGiving pharmacists the authorization to order and administer COVID-19 tests to their patients means easier access to testing for Americans who need it. Pharmacists play a vital role in delivering convenient access to important public health services and information. The Trump Administration is pleased to give pharmacists the chance to play a bigger role in the COVID-19 response, alongside all of America's heroic healthcare workers.\".20 This rapid diagnostic capability allows healthcare providers to quickly initiate antiviral medication, if appropriate, and direct infected patients to more acute care settings. Ensuring that pharmacists have the ability to order these diagnostics will expand access to care in underserved areas, reduce unnecessary burden on emergency departments that may already be strained with patients requiring a higher level of care, reduce community exposure by eliminating unnecessary office visits, and ensure that patients needing higher levels of care are referred to their physician or hospital for treatment.",
