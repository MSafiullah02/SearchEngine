However, administration has been virtually non-existent in developing countries, mainly because of the prohibitively high cost of the vaccine and difficulties in implementing vaccination programs, which require three injections for adolescent girls, over a six-month period [6]. The recently approved nonavalent vaccine (Gardasil 9, Merck) provides protection against 5 additional oncogenic types (HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, 58) [7], [8]; however, it possesses the same difficulties as its predecessor.",

As a proof of concept, MVs have been used to express antigens derived from HIV [17], [18], hepatitis B [14], West Nile virus [19], SARS coronavirus [20], and Chikungunya virus [21], [22]. In most of these studies, rMVs expressing heterologous antigens appeared to induce long-term specific neutralizing antibodies, even in the presence of pre-existing immunity against MV [23], [24]. In a previous study, our rMV-HPV16L1 vaccine candidate was found to effectively induce specific neutralizing antibodies against HPV16L1 [9], [25] in transgenic CD46IFNAR mice susceptible to MV infection [26]. Here, we examined the development of the recombinant live attenuated MV Edmonston-Zagreb (rMVEZ) strain as a viral vector to carry heterologous genes encoding the major capsid protein L1 of HPV-type-16 and HPV-type-18 in rhesus monkeys and compared their immunogenicity in a traditional methylotrophic P. pastoris-based expression system [27].",

Plasmid p(+)MVEZ, delivering correctly T7-initiated and ribozyme-terminated MV antigenome, was constructed as previously described [12]. BssHII-AatII cloning of the synthetic genes as additional transcription units was in position 2 (between the P and M protein genes) of p(+)MVEZ [Fig. 1\n]. The methods used for cloning were similar to those described by Sambrook and Russell [28]. The ligated products were transformed into Escherichia coli XL10-Gold (Stratagene, USA) Ultra Competent cells. Growing colonies selected by ampicillin (100 \u03bcg/mL) resistance were screened by BssHII-AatII digestion after minipreparation of plasmid DNAs, following the Qiagen Plasmid Purification protocol. Recombinant positive clones, named p(+)MVEZHPV16L1 and p(+)MVEZHPV18L1, were used to transform XL10-Gold cells, amplified by maxipreparation following the Qiagen Plasmid Purification protocol, assayed by analytical digestion, and confirmed by primer-walking sequencing (Eurofins MWG Biotech, Germany). The rMVEZHPV16L1 and rMVEZHPV18L1 viruses were then rescued by 293T cells transfection in a five-plasmid transfection system. Single syncytia were expanded in the MRC-5 cell line to establish passage 0 (P0); the recombinant viruses were serially passaged to prepare sufficient virus stocks. The rMVEZHPVs were quantified by CCID50 microtitration in 96-well plates by Spearman and Karber formula [29].",

            "text": "The cost effectiveness of the rMVEZ-HPV vaccine is better than the vaccines produced by the market leaders Gardasil and Cervarix. Vaccination costs can vary by country; in developed countries, Gardasil costs approximately $120 per dose, and Cervarix, $100 [32]. Commercially, HPV vaccines are offered at $4.5. In developed countries, measles vaccines cost approximately $10 and are offered to UNICEF at a price of $0.24. Both commercial HPV vaccines require a complete three-dose vaccination regimen to confer protective immunity. Therefore, these vaccines cannot fulfill the needs of HPV vaccination in developing countries or low-resource areas. The process of vaccine production is complex and involves numerous steps (seed and batch fermentation, lysis, clarification, chromatography, ultracentrifugation and/or ultrafiltration, sterile filtration, adjuvant adsorption, and filling) when using yeast or other classical recombinant expression systems such as baculovirus. In contrast, live measles vaccines can be produced quickly and simply using MRC-5 cells for virus propagation in roller bottles followed by harvesting of the supernatant, clarification, blending, final filling, and lyophilization. The yield of live virus measles HPV was quite high at approximately 400,000 doses or more per batch of 100 roller bottles. The yield of yeast-based HPV vaccine production is lower at approximately 50,000 doses from a 20 L batch.",

Therefore, these vaccines can be combined for use in the field with already commercially available VLP vaccines. Furthermore, to verify the effect of pre-existing immunity against measles on the anti-HPV immune response by the recombinant vaccine candidate, we administered boosters of the MV-HPV vaccine in MV-primed animals. We observed significant increases in titres post-boost with HPV16/18L1. Thus, individuals with preimmune titres of measles can also be vaccinated for HPV.",
