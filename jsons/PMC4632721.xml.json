Acute HCV infection is spontaneously cured in 20%\u201330% of patients, but the majority of infected patients fail to clear the virus and develop chronic persistent infection [2,3,4]. In addition to a combination regimen of pegylated interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 and ribavirin, direct acting antiviral drugs (DAAs) against HCV have been developed, and a high rate of sustained virological response (SVR) has been achieved by using these antiviral drugs [5]. However, the high cost of these drugs results in limited access in developing nations where the disease burden is high; therefore, there is still a need for the development of a prophylactic vaccine.",

Therefore, understanding HCV-host interactions and immune responses are important novel therapeutics with a higher barrier to viral resistance can be developed [6]. However, there is no established small animal model for the study of the entire life cycle of HCV infection and immunopathogenesis [7]. Severe combined immunodeficiency mice grafted with human hepatocytes are the only small animals that can be infected with HCV, although they cannot exert adaptive immune responses [8]. Recently, genetically-humanized mouse models are being developed to recapitulate the entire life cycle of HCV [9,10], but these models have restricted replication of HCV, limiting their utility.",

This isolate was obtained from a Japanese patient with fulminant HCV infection and was called JFH-1 [13,14,15]. Viral particles produced by the transfection of Huh-7 cells with in vitro transcribed JFH-1 RNA could infect na\u00efve cells in cell culture and the liver of chimpanzees in vivo [14]. The HCV virion particles derived from the cell culture system were named \u201cHCVcc\u201d [13].

They replicated and propagated efficiently in Huh-7.5 cells, although they had adaptive mutations to facilitate their replication [16,17]. The first genotype 1a strain, H77-S, replicated and released infectious particles in Huh-7 cells and immortalized human hepatocytes, although the amount of released virus was lower than JFH-1 [18,19]. The Con1 (genotype 1b) cell culture system was also reported, but a very low level of replication has also limited its utility [20]. Recently, a new cell culture system of genotype 1a was developed. The TN genome with eight mutations (TNcc) [21] and H77C recombinant harboring 19 mutations (H77Ccc) replicated and spread efficiently in Huh-7.5 cells [22].

Currently, HCVcc systems for genotypes 4, 5, and 6 are unavailable. For genotypes 1 and 2, only specific patient clones have been propagated in cell culture systems. It should be noted, however, that a new host factor, SEC14L2 was recently reported to enable replication of non-adapted HCV in hepatoma cells [24]. New cell culture system utilizing SEC14L2-expressing hepatoma cells may overcome the limited availability of HCVcc system. Another limitation of the current HCVcc system is the non-polarized nature of Huh-7-based cells [25,26]. Hepatocytes are highly polarized in the liver and cell-to-cell transmission takes an important part in the spread of HCV, but the current HCVcc system does not reflect the viral spread occurring in the infected liver. In addition, Huh-7 cells are not fully differentiated [27] and, thus, have a defect in activation of the innate immune response by HCVcc infection [28].",

Differentiated hepatocyte-like cells (DHCs) induced from pluripotent stem cells have also been used for HCVcc infection [32,33,34]. DHCs were found to mount an efficient innate immune response after HCVcc infection, including the production of chemokines and type III IFNs [33]. Recently, DHCs from adipose tissue-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (AT-hMSCs) were used for HCVcc infection [35], and the entry and replication of HCVcc were found to occur efficiently in DHCs from AT-hMSCs.",

Similar to other viruses, HCV uses several mechanisms to interfere with the induction of IFNs, particularly NS3/4A protease. NS3/4A cleaves MAVS, which leads to the impairment of signaling and IFN production in response to HCV RNA [41]. MAVS cleavage by NS3/4A has also been confirmed in HCV-infected liver tissue [42]. NS5A also contributes to immune evasion from the host. IFN-\u03b3 expression is inhibited in NS5A-transgenic mice after adenoviral challenge, meaning that NS5A plays an important role toward establishment of chronic HCV infection [43].",

            "text": "Despite HCV interference with the induction of IFNs, IFNs are endogenously produced by HCV-infected cells [28,29,44,45,46]. Both genotype 2a [28,29,44,45,46] and genotype 1a [29] were reported to activate intracellular interferon signaling pathways. IFNs are currently classified into three major classes: type I, type II, and type III. Among them, type I and III IFNs are considered innate immune response IFNs. Among type I IFNs, there are 13 IFN-\u03b1s, in addition to IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03c9, IFN-\u03b5, and IFN-\u03ba [47]. IFN-\u03bbs (IFN-\u03bb1 or IL-29; -\u03bb2 or IL-28A; and -\u03bb3 or IL-28B) are a new family of IFNs that have been designated as type III IFNs. Since the discovery of IFN-\u03bbs in 2003, their functions have been considered to overlap with type I IFNs because signaling via the IFN-\u03bb receptor is similar to that via the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor. After binding to their receptors, type I and III IFNs initiate a signaling cascade through the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways. The cellular actions are then mediated by the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that have antiviral and/or immunomodulatory activity [48,49].",

This finding suggests that HCV infection potently stimulates the production of endogenous IFNs, which leads to ISG up-regulation in infected liver [55], and that HCV survives under the ISG up-regulation perhaps due to the protein kinase R (PKR)-mediated suppression of ISG protein translation [56,57].",

Recently, it was demonstrated that prolonged induction of a set of ISGs is mediated by unphosphorylated ISGF3 (U-ISGF3), which is composed of unphosphorylated STAT1 (U-STAT1), unphosphorylated STAT2 (U-STAT2), and IRF9 [58,59]. The U-ISGF3 level is increased by sustained exposure to IFNs, and U-ISGF3 leads to enhanced expression of a set of ISGs (U-ISGF3-downstream ISGs, U-ISGs) [58]. In other words, there appear to be two phases of ISG expression following type III or I IFN stimulation. The initial rapid response is driven by the classical phosphorylated form of ISGF3, which is followed by a second, more prolonged response driven by U-ISGF3 [58].",

Moreover, it has been shown that increased ISG expression at baseline is a stronger predictor of a poor response to pegylated IFN-\u03b1/ribavirin therapy than is the IL28B genotype [53]. Some reports have emphasized USP18 as a critical factor conferring unresponsiveness to exogenous IFN-\u03b1 treatment by suppressing intracellular signaling [65,66,67,68]. However, the mechanism underlying the increase and maintenance of USP18 protein levels in HCV-infected liver has not been clearly elucidated. Recently, we found that prolonged exposure to IFN-\u03bb up-regulates U-ISGF3 and U-ISGs, including ISG15, and that ISG15 causes the refractoriness to exogenous IFN-\u03b1 treatment by stabilizing USP18 protein [60].",

            "text": "In 2013, the gene IFNL4 was first described [69]. IFNL4 expression is influenced by a germline dinucleotide frameshift variant located in exon 1 of IFNL4 [69]. The IFNL4-\u2206G allele generates the full-length IFN-\u03bb4 protein, whereas the IFNL4-TT allele does not create IFN-\u03bb4 due to a premature stop [69]. The IFNL4-\u2206G allele is associated with a poor response to pegylated IFN-\u03b1/ribavirin therapy [69,70], and a recent study concluded that the IFNL4-\u2206G/TT genotype is the primary polymorphism underlying poor treatment response in HCV-infected patients [71]. Another study showed that IFNL4-\u2206G genotype is associated with high levels of ISGs and that hepatic levels of ISG15 in chronic hepatitis C are strongly associated with IFN-\u03bb4 expression, suggesting that IFN-\u03bb4 contributes to induction of ISGs in HCV-infected liver [72]. Forced expression of IFNL4 gene up-regulates ISGs in PHHs and HepG2 cells [69,73], and has antiviral effects against HCV [74]. Recombinant IFN-\u03bb4 protein activates the JAK-STAT pathway through binding to the IFN-\u03bb receptor [75], evokes similar gene expression pattern to IFN-\u03bb3 [76]. Future study using HCVcc infection systems will explain the mechanism of IFN-\u03bb4 induction in HCV-infected cells and the effects of endogenous IFN-\u03bb4 on both ISG induction and the response to exogenous IFN-\u03b1 treatment.",

            "text": "After HCV infection, the expression of some genes is down-regulated, and the expression of those genes tends to be further down-regulated in the liver of non-responders to IFN treatment [61,77]. One of the genes down-regulated in HCV-infected liver is dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1), a mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase (MKP) that de-phosphorylates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) [78]. We demonstrated that silencing DUSP1 expression inhibits HCV replication in HCVcc-infected cells and HCV replicon cells by up-regulating antiviral ISGs [77]. DUSP1 silencing enhances the nuclear translocation of STAT1 and causes the induction of ISGs [77]. Although the detailed mechanism of DUSP1 down-regulation in HCV-infected liver remains to be elucidated, this serves as an example of how hosts regulate the expression of ISGs and restrict viral infection while bypassing endogenous IFN production.",

Recently, we demonstrated using an HCVcc system that IFN-induced up-regulation of MHC class I molecules is attenuated by HCV infection [57]. HCV RNA activates PKR, which phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1 to block the translation of proteins, including ISGs [56] and MHC class I [57]. The attenuated expression of MHC class I by HCV infection causes a reduction of the effector functions of HCV-specific CD8+ T cells [57]. Before our study, several studies had investigated the effect of HCV proteins on MHC class I expression with conflicting results. The expression of MHC class I was not affected by overexpression of HCV proteins in one study [80], whereas another study showedup-regulation of MHC class I expression by the HCV core [81]. By using an HCVcc model, we were able to evaluate the effect of the whole life cycle of HCV infection on MHC class I expression, and we demonstrated the attenuation of IFN-induced MHC class I expression by HCVcc infection.",
