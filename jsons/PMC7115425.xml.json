Mega-events\u2019 effects on host countries include increased tourist receipts, income, employment, government revenues, and cultural awareness, along with an improved image of the country (Lee, Lee, & Lee, 2005). To realize these positive effects, however, host countries experience high infrastructure development and other costs. Getz (1991) recognizes festivals and events as a new wave of alternative tourism, contributing to sustainable development and improving the relationships between hosts and guests.",

Investments in tourism infrastructures require huge financial commitments from both the public and private sectors. More accurate forecasts provide better estimates of expected return on investments, which help guide investment decisions (Song & Witt, 2006). Specifically, forecasting demand for an international tourism Expo is not only important in the bidding process among international competitors, but also is necessary to help gain public support for hosting the mega-event and determine the expected benefits and costs associated with hosting the event. In the planning stage, forecasting tourism demand is prerequisite to determine factors impacting investment decisions such as the capacity of the Expo site and facilities, necessary road and transportation system expansions, and appropriate food and lodging facilities. Accurate forecasts of tourism demand, therefore, not only help the event planners ensure the successful hosting of an Expo, but also provide them with considerable information to guide their investment decisions (Lee, 1996).",

In spite of the plethora of research on demand forecasting, little research has been conducted on forecasting tourism demand for such an Expo. Because most international Expos are a one-time event, past quantitative data are very limited, increasing the difficulty in predicting Expo demand. The current study provides a methodology that combines different approaches based on available data to overcome the lack of data. Forecasts of the number of tourists visiting the Yeosu International Marine Expo are obtained by combining quantitative techniques with willingness-to-visit (WTV) obtained from survey data.",

International tourist demand is estimated by combining forecasts of international tourist demand based on historical data with survey data on WTV. Before quantitative methods are combined with WTV from the survey, several different quantitative time-series forecasting models of international tourist arrivals are estimated and evaluated. A range of forecasts is obtained using the different methods to provide a richer view of the potential demand for the Expo. Domestic demand is based on WTV derived from a survey and population projections. Forecast of total domestic and international visitors from these methods are then compared to an estimate obtained from experts using the Delphi method.",

Results indicate that both the Box\u2013Jenkins and the exponential smoothing models performed equally well in terms of forecasting accuracy, but the latter may be preferred because it is easier to use. Geurts and Ibrahim (1982) demonstrate that the forecasting accuracy of Hawaiian tourism was greatly improved after accounting for atypical months and if the forecasts were updated annually. Burger et al. (2001) compared na\u00efve, moving average (MA), ARIMA, decomposition, and exponential smoothing time-series models in forecasting the US demand for travel to Durban, South Africa. They indicate that in terms of accuracy the exponential smoothing model performed best, followed by na\u00efve, ARIMA, and MA models. The decomposition method performance was inferior to the other models. Lim and McAleer (2001) show the Holt-Winters seasonal exponential smoothing models outperformed both the single and double exponential smoothing models in predicting tourist arrivals to Australia. Lim (2002) employed ARIMA models to forecast international tourism demand for Australia. Their results show that the ARIMA models outperformed the seasonal ARIMA models for forecasting demand from Hong Kong and Malaysia tourists, but demand from Singapore tourists was better forecasted using the seasonal ARIMA model. Goh and Law (2002) found that ARIMA models with seasonality and interventions performed better than other time-series models, because the ARIMA Intervention model reflected the impacts from special events. Cho (2003) predicted tourism demand from different countries to Hong Kong using three time-series models, exponential smoothing, ARIMA, and artificial neural networks. Results indicate the artificial network model outperformed the smoothing and ARIMA models. Cho (2003), however, suggested that ARIMA and smoothing models were also sufficiently adequate for forecasting tourism demand. Kulendran and Witt (2003b) indicate the ARIMA model was more accurate than the error correction model (ECM) for short-term forecasts; however, the ECM outperformed the ARIMA for long-term forecasts.",

Income is often identified as the single most important determinant of international tourism demand (Artus, 1972; Barry & O\u2019Hagan, 1972; Crouch, 1994; Di Matteo & Di Matteo, 1993; Gray, 1966; Jud & Joseph, 1974; Laber, 1969; Lee, 1996; Lee, Var, & Blaine, 1996; Loeb, 1982; Sheldon, 1993; Stronge & Redman, 1982; Uysal & Cromption, 1984; Witt & Martin, 1987).

Other variables such as exchange rate (Artus, 1972; Gerakis, 1965; Lee et al., 1996; Uysal & Cromption, 1984) and marketing aspects (Barry & O\u2019Hagan, 1972; Crouch, 1994; Lee, 1996; Uysal & Cromption, 1984) are often found to be significant explanatory variables.",

Qualitative techniques include the Delphi method, which was first applied by Dalkey and Helmer (1963). Being dependent upon the accumulated experience of experts, this method assembles a panel of experts from disciplines to obtain a group consensus concerning the likely outcome of future events (Archer, 1987). This method assumes that the range of responses will decrease as convergence is achieved toward the midrange of the distribution (Kaynak & Macaulay, 1984). One example of the use of the Delphi model is Liu (1988). Liu predicted Hawaiian tourism demand for 2000 using two separate panels, local tourist receivers and overseas tourist senders. Forecasts of tourism demand made by both local and outside experts were generally consistent with state projections. Lee and Kim (1998) also used the Delphi model for predicting international tourism demand for World Cup games in Korea. Forecasts made by the panel members were 456,000 attendees to the 2002 World Cup which is slightly higher than the actual tourists arrivals of 403,000 (Korea National Tourism Organization, 2006) during the World Cup.",

Empirical studies show that forecasts from complex and statistically sophisticated methods are not necessarily more accurate than forecasts from relatively simple methods (Makridakis, 1986; Lim & McAleer, 2002). Martin and Witt (1989) indicate that econometric models may not be more accurate than time-series models in terms of forecasts. Van Doorn (1984) maintains that the use of simple forecasting models proved more accurate than complex models. Ascher (1978, p. 199) also observed, \u201cThe presumed advantages of sophisticated methodologies simply have not materialized.\u201d For this reason, Calantone et al. (1987) stressed that complex model building should not be undertaken for its own sake. Li et al. (2006) correctly assert that there is no single forecasting model that performs better than the others in all cases because many factors influence forecasting performance. Although many studies indicate that relatively simple methods often outperform sophisticated or complex models, debate on the performance between simple and complex models in terms of forecasting accuracy is still ongoing.",

The primary limitation of MSE is that it does not facilitate comparisons across different time series or over different time intervals, because it is an absolute measure (Makridakis, Wheelwright, & Victor, 1983). RMSE has also limitation in terms of less intuitive (Ascher, 1978). MAPE has been preferred by many researchers (Burger et al., 2001; Cho, 2003; Chu, 1998; Kulendran & Witt, 2003b; Song & Witt, 2006; Wheelwright & Makridakis, 1985), because it is expressed as a percentage of actual values over predicted values. Lewis (1982) suggests the following interpretation of the MAPE statistic: highly accurate forecasts are associated with the model if the MAPE is less than or equal to 10%; good forecasts for MAPE=10\u201320%; reasonable forecasting for MAPE=20\u201350%; and inaccurate forecasting for greater than MAPE=50%. MAPE is calculated by the following equation:(1)MAPE=\u2211i=1n|(Xi-Fi)/Xin|\u00d7100where Xi is the actual data for period i; Fi the forecast for period i; | | represents absolute value; and n the number of observations.",

As in the foreign estimations, it is assumed the WTV percentage is represented by the percentage of respondents indicating a 4 (likely to visit) and a 5 (very likely to visit) on the Likert-type scale. WTV ranged from the low of 10.7% for Ulsan to the high of 41.6% for Jeonnam province. Survey results indicate the regions closer to the venue of the Expo generally have higher WTV. For example, Jeonnam, Kwangju, and Jeonbuk provinces, which are close to the Yeosu, have relatively large WTV, 41.6%, 38.9%, and 34.9%. On the other hand, Jeju, Kangwon, Kyongbuk, and Ulsan provinces which are further away from the venue have smaller WTV, ranging from 10.7% to 13.4%. This finding implies that distance between origin and destination is likely to act as a deterrent to attending the Expo. Expo demand by domestic adults is predicted by multiplying adult population in 2012 by WTV for each region and then summing the regional demands. Approximately 6.7 million domestic adults are predicted to attend the Expo (Table 5). Although Seoul metropolitan city and Kyonggi province have low WTV, predicted demands from these regions are relatively larger than less populated regions with larger WTV, because the these two regions have the largest populations in Korea.",

Based on the Delphi survey, 27 experts predicted approximately 6.8 million visitors to the Expo. Comments made by panel members, indicated they considered distance or accessibility as the most important barrier to increasing Expo demand. Experts in the Delphi method predicted lower demand for the Expo than the combined quantitative techniques with WTV surveys. Both methods have merit and only time will tell which estimates are closest.",

            "text": "It is interesting to compare the above forecasts with other forecasts of the demand for the Expo. An official of the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE) expected the Expo demand between 7 and 9 million visitors, a former BIE official predicted 8 million, and the Director of Producer of the 2006 Aichi Expo predicted 7\u20138 million (Korea Marine Institute, 2006). The lower boundary predicted by overseas experts is similar to forecasts by local experts, whereas the upper boundary predicted by overseas experts is to be similar to forecasts by the quantitative techniques with WTV surveys. Another interesting comparison is to compare the estimates of the Yeosu Expo to the number of visitors to previous Expos. The 93 Daejon Expo, was the first BIE Expo held in South Korea. The number of visitors to the Daejon Expo was 14 million people over 3 months (Korea Marine Institute, 2006). Twenty-two million people attended the 2005 Aichi Expo in Japan over 6 months, which is 7 million more visitors than the sponsors expected to attend (Aichi Expo Organizing Committee, 2006). The number of visitors to both of these previous Expos is higher than even the most optimistic demand forecast for the Yeosu Expo. One potential reason is both the Daejon Expo and the Aichi Expo were held in areas that have relatively larger population bases than the Yeosu area. Another reason is there are two types of Expos, one held for 3 months and the other for 6 months. The Aichi Expo lasted 6 months as compared to 3 months planned for the Yeosu Expo. These comparisons between past Expos and forecasted demand, along with experts\u2019 opinions further suggest that distance and capacities of hosting city are significant factors determining demand for Expos.",

First, forecasts of the Expo demand are important in the bidding process of the international tourism Expo. One selection criteria of the host city is the magnitude of demand, as well as the appropriateness of the forecasting methods used. Second, forecasts of Expo demand may not only help generate public support, but are also important to help avoid shortages or surpluses in the tourism businesses (Burger et al., 2001). The forecasts of the Expo demand provide managers with planning infrastructure, such as magnitude of Expo site and facilities, number of hotel rooms, expansion of road and transportation system, etc. These infrastructures are highly dependent upon estimates of tourism demand because they require huge financial investment from private and public sectors.",

An engineering company which is responsible for the site planning for the Expo unofficially predicted that the Expo site is able to accommodate approximately 8 million visitors in terms of the capacity of site and road system. The higher estimates of Expo demand predicted by quantitative approaches with WTV appeared to slightly exceed the supply-side, whereas the smaller estimates of Expo demand predicted by the Delphi method is within the supply-side capabilities.",
