However necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a kind of intestinal excessive inflammation, still remains a major contributor to mortality rates as high as 20\u201330% and has been confirmed as a multi-factor disease [1, 2]. Immature intestinal development, abnormal bacterial colonization, inappropriate feeding, and inflammatory cascades are all responsible for triggering of NEC [3, 4]. The disease has a blurry onset and a rapid progression making it undetectable in the early stages. Starting with feeding intolerance or abdominal distention, it will gradually evolve into catastrophic complications such as sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and death [4].",

Relative ratio (RR) was calculated for dichotomous outcome, while mean difference (MD) was used for the continuous outcome. For both outcomes, 95% confidence intervals (CI) were considered. Statistical heterogeneity was estimated using the Chi-square based Q test with p value and I2 statistic displaying. The value of I2 was categorized into low (0\u201340%), moderate (30\u201360%), substantial (50\u201390%), and considerable (75\u2013100%) to evaluate the heterogeneity among studies [31]. If I2 < 50%, the fix-effect model was used, if not, the random-effect model was chosen, considering the significant heterogeneity among the studies. Subgroup analysis was required to find the source of heterogeneity by classifying different studies. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted to testify the stability of the pooled results. Publication bias was assessed by making a funnel plot using Egger\u2019s test if at least ten studies were included in this meta-analysis [32].",

The risk of blinding of participants and personnel was high in four studies [18, 33, 35, 36] and unclear in one study [37]. Similarly, four studies [18, 33, 35, 36] were also of high ROB in blinding of the outcome assessment, with two studies [23, 37] of unclear risk. Low ROB was mainly in incomplete outcome data and selective reporting, while unclear risk appeared in other bias. To better identify the ROB of the included studies, we generate a graph presenting the percentages for each domain and the outcome of each ROB assessment are displayed in Fig. 2.",

Some studies found that colostrum was effective in reducing the rate of NEC, revealing its effect in building up immunity [11, 39\u201342]. Term babies could suck their mothers\u2019 nipples to obtain breast milk and their immunity would be triggered through the first bite with colostrum being served as stimulator [43, 44]. However, preterm infants who have undeveloped digestive systems are deprived of this natural process because they have to be breastfed via a nasogastric tube that bypasses their oropharynx. Some researchers found that the oral cavities of ill babies are easily colonized by pathogens after being administrated into the NICU and the use of oral rinses such as chlorhexidine, could bring unpleasant adverse effects [45, 46]. Thus, oral priming with colostrum is a better way to help preterm infants to strengthen their immunity, thereby preventing infections.",

Immunity building is a long-term process, and OAC should be continued over longer periods to determine its effects. For example, Glass et al., using OAC intervention for 5 days, found that the level of sIgA of saliva increased statistically on day 7 but without a subsequent increase on day 14 [18]. This indicates that extended OAC treatment might provide sustained immune protection.",

Achieving full enteral feeding is an important health outcome since it is related to the removal of the central line, possibly, to lower infection rates [52]. The duration of hospital stay reflects the condition of preterm infants and the related medical costs, and the pooled results indicate that OAC would shorten the time to achieve these two goals. Some other clinical or biochemical outcomes in these RCT studies still need to be discussed. Abd-Elgawad et al. have reported lower growth rates of Klebsiella species in the oropharyngeal pouch, a lower incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia, a shorter duration of oxygen therapy and, fewer episodes of feeding intolerance after OAC treatment [22]. In another study, Zhang et al. have reported that OAC could raise the level of lactoferrin in saliva after 7 days and 21 days, while Glass et al. have also found increased sIgA levels of saliva at day 7 [18, 23]. Sohn et al. have reported changes in the oral microbiota colonization in the OAC group [36], while Lee et al. report a decreased level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an increased level of immune-protective factors compared with the control group [34]. Overall, these results suggest the potential positive effects of OAC on the biochemical outcomes, without any adverse effects.",
