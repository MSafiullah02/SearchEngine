The Metro South Human Research Ethics Committee approved this study (#HREC/09/QPAH/037). Patient immunosuppression was administered according to standard unit protocol. Specifically, induction therapy consisted of 20 mg intravenous basiliximab preoperatively and at day 4 postoperatively, and 500 mg intravenous methylprednisolone preoperatively and 12 h postoperatively. Oral tacrolimus was administered preoperatively at a dose of 0.075 mg/kg, and continued twice daily to achieve individualized target trough concentrations of approximately 6\u201310 \u03bcg/L over months 1\u20133 and 3\u20138 \u03bcg/L thereafter.

Assay specificity was ensured by in silico analyses against contrasting PyV genomes and the use of confirmatory assays. In most cases, samples were considered positive only if both the primary and confirmatory assays were positive. WUPyV, JCPyV, and BKPyV genomes have been well characterized, and therefore single detection assays could be used with high confidence of specificity. Quantification was performed using plasmid standards containing each assay target (Life Technologies, Scoresby, Australia). Assays targeting JCPyV, BKPyV, WUPyV, and KIPyV utilized the Qiagen Quantitect Probe PCR mix kit (Qiagen, Australia), while the remaining PyV assays (MCPyV, HPyV6,7,9,12, TSPyV, MWPyV, and STLPyV) used the Bioline SensiMix II Probe PCR mix kit (Bioline, Eveleigh, Australia). Standard curves were retrospectively applied to pre\u2010existing JCPyV and BKPyV detection data; therefore, calculated viral loads for the two viruses should only be taken as approximate values. For every assay, 8 pmol of each respective primer, 3.2 pmol of respective probe, and 2 \u03bcL of template were used in a final reaction volume of 20 \u03bcL. Cycling was performed with either a Rotorgene 6000 (Qiagen, Australia), or a LightCycler 480 (Roche Diagnostics, Castle Hill, Australia). All assays displayed a reproducible sensitivity of approximately 10 copies/reaction. Extended respiratory virus screening included the following: respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3 viruses, human adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, coronaviruses 229E, HKU1, OC43, NL63, human rhinovirus, and cytomegalovirus by using previously reported real\u2010time PCR assays 21, 22.",

The persistent detection of KIPyV in the NTS samples, the increasing viral loads, and concurrent respiratory symptoms align with KIPyV's possible involvement in respiratory disease 26. In the only other study to describe KIPyV in KTx patients, the detection of the virus in respiratory tract samples was concluded by the authors not to be associated with respiratory disease, as only 17% of cases presented with mild upper respiratory tract infection 11. However, in this study, 43% of cases were associated with respiratory tract disease, with no other pathogen detected. This suggests that virus reactivation and disease may be possible under certain circumstances, such as long\u2010term pre\u2010existing immunosuppression (e.g. patients 43 and 68 in this study); however, further study with larger numbers of cases is required to formalize any links between KIPyV and respiratory disease. Recently KIPyV was reported as the sole pathogen in the upper respiratory tract and lung tissue of a pediatric transplant patient who died of respiratory failure 27, which adds further evidence towards a contextual role of the virus in respiratory disease.",

In this study, however, there were only a limited number of patients in whom these viruses were detected, and therefore it was difficult to discern associations with subsequent skin pathologies. Skin malignancies occur more often in fair\u2010skinned people; therefore, a subpopulation of the cohort that was selected for light complexions was used to examine the MCPyV data in further detail. A number of MCPyV\u2010positive patients in the subgroup went on to develop skin cancer, but the malignancy rates were not significantly different from those of the overall population. While the results are suggestive of a lack of association between MCPyV and skin malignancies, the small number of cases clearly require further studies with much larger sample sizes and longer posttransplant periods to adequately address any potential role of MCPyV in KTx patient skin pathology. The frequency of persistent MCPyV shedding in the respiratory tract is also of great interest, and should be a target of future investigation.",
