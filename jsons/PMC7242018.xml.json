At that time, though, Italy was not considered a high-risk country and the national and local guidelines were not particularly specific or detailed. On February 21, the first Italian COVID-19 case was reported in a small town 200 km from Bologna, and the same day another 20 citizens tested positive in the same area. On February 22, the Ministry of Health released detailed guidelines based on both clinical and epidemiological criteria for how to define suspect cases and how to organize the healthcare response. On February 23, the Rizzoli\u2019s Medical Affairs Department adapted the national guidelines for the specific settings of care of its hospital facility by issuing the first of a series of local instructions. This document was particularly focused on two main aspects: (1) instructing doctors, nurses, and administrative employees to recognize patients with suspect of COVID-19 in the emergency setting, surgery wards and outpatient clinics, and define specific pathways for these patients; (2) providing the most appropriate PPE for each healthcare professional potentially exposed to the infection. It was apparent that the latter was a critical issue, because the risk of a pandemic had been globally underestimated, and national and local authorities had not secured sufficient stocks of protective equipment. In order to keep up with the swiftly changing epidemiological context, the hospital management updated protocols and instructions daily for a rational and evidence-oriented use of the PPEs, and organized educational meetings to instruct healthcare workers on their appropriate use.",

The hospital, which is part of the National Health Service but was not assigned to be a COVID-hospital, had the first COVID-19 case in a patient and in a nurse on March 9. In the following days, the number of cases among patients and healthcare workers increased, and the hospital management responded not only with a massive swab testing campaign aimed at detecting contact histories among patients and healthcare workers but also with an additional testing campaign for asymptomatic healthcare workers. At the same time, the level of PPE protection was raised, with the use of surgical masks in all patients with any respiratory symptoms and all healthcare workers who were in contact with these patients regardless of their clinical condition. In order to prevent the contamination of healthcare workers and other patients, specific pathways for patients with suspect or confirmed COVID-19 were established for the operating room, intensive care unit, emergency department, and surgical wards with specific hygiene and prevention protocols. Starting from March 20, a specific COVID-19 ward with 14 beds for patients with a musculoskeletal disease was opened.",

The entire period has been characterized by a general sense of uncertainty and continuous change, among the hospital\u2019s employees and particularly the healthcare staff. Over the first 50 days of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Medical Affairs Department, together with Nursing Management, has constantly worked to inform, update and instruct the hospital\u2019s staff by discussing the most recent evidence and policies at the local and regional level, sharing the decisions with the clinical and nursing leaders, and applying an open-door policy for anyone in need of help or clarification on this topic.",

Therefore, only trauma surgery was allowed, together with oncologic and urgent cases such as osteomyelitis and wound infection dehiscence. All sports trauma, arthroscopy, joint replacement and spine deformity, which represented the core activity of the Institute were suppressed. Ambulatory surgery was cancelled, as well, in order to promote social distancing and avoid population movement, in line with government decrees. Activity of outpatient clinic was reduced to allow only indispensable follow-up visits, suppressing first-time consultations and creating a task force to implement telemedicine. Orthopaedic surgeons were organized in two different teams to allow a weekly-based alternation in the management of surgical trauma cases. This alternation allowed to limit the interaction among colleagues and to make up for the possible lack of personnel due to quarantine. Two operatory rooms, running from 7 AM to 7 PM were dedicated to trauma surgery, which were more than 50% hip fractures in elderly, followed by proximal humerus fractures and ankle fractures. Severe pelvic and spinal fractures were treated in the Trauma Center of the city, which is a multi-specialty hospital also designated as general COVID-center where an ICU for COVID patients was present.",

            "text": "I am one of the orthopaedic surgeons assigned on a weekly-basis to manage the \u201ctrauma-COVID ward\u201d in collaboration with an Internal Medicine doctor. The population of the ward is composed of COVID-19 positive patients and patients who were transferred from the \u201cclean\u201d trauma ward to guarantee isolation due to symptoms suggestive of COVID infection. Logistically, the ward is divided into a \u201cclean\u201d area, where staff is allowed to circulate with surgical mask, regular scrubs, cap and gloves; then, half of room corridor and all the rooms represent the \u201cdirty\u201d area, where entrance is allowed only with ffp2 mask, glasses, double gloves, disposable coat, and shoe coverage. Instructions for dressing and undressing are present in multiple spots, and these actions are performed under the supervision of a second person that controls the appropriateness of the procedure in order to avoid auto-contamination while removing protective gear. Mirrors helps the removal of head gear minimizing the risk of touching face skin. The distinction between a \u201cclean\u201d and \u201cdirty\u201d area is possible since patients are confined in isolation inside the rooms: two patients per room in the case of positivity for COVID-19, one patient per room in the case of suspected COVID or when diagnosis is in progress. Due to confinement of patients inside the rooms and limited droplet-generating procedures, this setting is considered a safe and smart environment for all the required medical activities. In fact, since patients with a non-confirmed COVID diagnosis could be admitted in this ward, isolation among patients\u2014unless confirmed positive\u2014and staff should be maintained in order to not create nosocomial contagion. One of the main challenges in the management of trauma-COVID patients is represented by the high mortality [5], especially of elderly patients. Of the first eight cases of hip fractures surgically treated (nail or replacement) in patients with COVID-19 diagnosis, three of them died within seven to ten days from surgery (unpublished preliminary data). Another challenge is obtaining an accurate and timely COVID diagnosis, as a relevant quote of false-negative swabs may be present [6]. Moreover, trauma patients are usually elderly with relevant co-morbidities often involving the respiratory system, and the typical \u201cground-glass\u201d appearance of the lungs at high-resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) [7] could be present as baseline characteristics when screened for COVID diagnosis. It is also possible that symptoms such as fever, weakness, and desaturation may be part of the \u201cclassical\u201d post-operative complications. If the general population with borderline presentation and indeterminate diagnosis can be safely managed with preventive home quarantine, this is not possible for post-operative trauma patients, since their condition does not allow basic self-care in complete isolation. On the other hand, their management in the usual non-COVID structures dedicated to post-operative rehabilitation would expose healthcare staff to contagious risk and local cluster onset, until 100% negativity is confirmed. The long-lasting treatment of these patients within the trauma-COVID ward does not represent a feasible option either, since the continuous surgical activity and the imminent risk of infection outbreak causes a permanent need for free beds which requires prompt patient turnover with discharge home or transfer to care facilities for assistance continuation. The other possible pathways for COVID-positive or suspected COVID are represented by the \u201cCOVID-hospitals\u201d equipped with high-volume ICUs in the case of complex patients possibly requiring ventilatory support, or the so-called COVID-resorts in the case of stable patients necessitating standard medical therapies. However, due to the special needs of trauma patients, like active physiotherapy and wound management, the isolation setting within all these paths in which a physiotherapeutic support is not contemplated, represents a dangerous threat for the quality of patient care and health maintenance. In fact, elderly patients, especially those with limited respiratory impairment, would enormously suffer from bed immobilization and isolation, due to the concrete risk of complications such as deep venous and pulmonary thromboembolism, bedsores, cognitive impairment and death [8, 9].",

Then I thought about the people I met in the Hospital; my colleagues but mostly the patients. In the end I thought about my own health. The quarantine began. After I came to know that I did not infect anyone, I started to fear about my own health. I was attentive to every symptom that could have possibly manifested. I was lucky enough to not have any of them, since some of my older orthopaedic colleagues had bad fevers and malaise for a couple of weeks, and few of them required hospitalization for non-invasive ventilator support. The more the days went by, the more I thought about when I could go back to work. According to the actual protocol, since I was asymptomatic, I took the first control test ten days after: Negative. Two days later the second control test: again, Negative. Therefore, I was able to return to work, and the concern I had before for my health had been directed back to others again.

The absence of predetermined guidelines made us build our approach on a daily basis, based on incoming requests, new problems to face, internal feedback, and increasing (limited) evidences. Therefore, at the moment, we are not able to provide an outcome of these measures or determine how their implementation has improved the management of COVID and non-COVID patients with fractures, but only to suggest useful recommendations (Table 1). However, the main lesson is that any actions should be quick and decisive, for one week during the COVID-19 epidemic could make the difference.",
