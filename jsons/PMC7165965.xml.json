Ingredients like spray\u2010dried plasma (SDP) or spray\u2010dried red blood cells are used in the food and meat industry to provide texture, emulsion capacity and natural colour properties (Appiah and Peggy 2012). Likewise, SDP is an ingredient extensively used globally in pig feed due to its well\u2010known beneficial effects on postweaning performance and survival (Torrallardona 2010). In contrast, pathogen contamination of animal\u2010based ingredients is a major safety concern for both food and feed industries. During the last decade, a significant amount of data has been published about the safety of commercial spray\u2010dried blood products relative to bacteria (Polo et al. 2002), and enveloped (Polo et al. 2005; Gerber et al. 2014; Opriessnig et al. 2014; Pujols and Segal\u00e9s 2014) and non\u2010enveloped viruses (Pujols et al. 2008, 2011, 2014; Shen et al. 2011; P\u00e9rez\u2010Bosque et al. 2016) affecting the swine industry. These studies have demonstrated the importance of several features of the manufacturing process of commercial blood products that contribute to the bio\u2010safety of these functional ingredients. In addition, the liquid blood of multiple pigs slaughtered per day is pooled. Pooling of blood that inherently contains antibodies with neutralizing capacity against a variety of pathogens contributes to the biosafety of the finished product (Williams and Khan 2010; Polo et al. 2013).",

The spray\u2010drying process involves four stages of operation as follows: (i) atomization of liquid source into a hot chamber; (ii) contact between the spray and the drying medium (very hot air at a high gas mass to liquid mass flow volume ratio); (iii) moisture evaporation resulting in particle formation; and (4) separation of dried products from the air stream (Kuriakose and Anandharamakrishnan 2010). During the spray\u2010drying process, computer systems designed to control and monitor processing temperatures and conditions are used to ensure that SDBP have been exposed to a minimum of 80\u00b0C throughout its substance. This is one of the most important critical control points in the manufacturing process of SDBP intended for human or animal consumption.",

Therefore, most SDBP manufacturers have adopted postprocessing storage of SDP of porcine origin at room temperature (>20\u00b0C) for at least 2 weeks after production as an additional safety feature (Sampedro et al. 2015). Thus, the sequential action of spray\u2010drying and storage at room temperature for at least 2 weeks after spray\u2010drying and packaging is able to inactivate micro\u2010organisms.",

Initially, as moisture is lost, the particle is maintained at the adiabatic wet\u2010bulb temperature, then, the droplet temperature increases to reach a value close or similar to the outlet air temperature (Straatsma et al. 2007; Perdana et al. 2013, 2015). Inlet and outlet temperature are the two main parameters that have a major influence on the inactivation of micro\u2010organisms. Inactivation occurs predominantly during the initial period of drying, while the remaining drying time further decreases the moisture content (Perdana et al. 2013, 2015). The survival of micro\u2010organisms is reduced by increasing the inlet temperature, but the outlet air temperature has the greatest impact on pathogen inactivation because this is the minimum temperature that the particle will achieve during the drying process; therefore, higher outlet temperature typically results in higher microbial inactivation (Perdana et al. 2013, 2015). Relatively high drying temperatures and rapid dehydration are two phenomena involved in microbial inactivation. Although the most important site of damage caused by dehydration is the cytoplasmic membrane (Crowe et al. 1987; Lievense and Van't Riet 1994), dehydration also produces damage to DNA/RNA and proteins (Lievense 1992). Results of the current study demonstrated that a greater reduction in both Salmonella spp. counts was observed at the higher outlet temperature, although it was only statistically significant for S. typhimurium. The minimum outlet spray\u2010drying temperature is 80\u00b0C for the commercial manufacturing process of SDP (Sampedro et al. 2015; P\u00e9rez\u2010Bosque et al. 2016) and results of the present study suggested that both Salmonella spp. strains were susceptible to spray\u2010drying even at a lower outlet temperature (71\u00b0C).",

The main differences between laboratory and pilot plant dryers compared with industrial dryers are design, size and volume processed, all of which affect the retention or dwell time of the product within the chamber (Foster and Leatherman 1995). Laboratory spray\u2010dryers have reduced retention or dwell time of the product within the chamber (<1 s) compared with commercial dryers (between 20 and 90 s, depending upon scale and design of the dryer). Furthermore, there is an immediate cooling to room temperature of the small quantity of dried product produced by lab dryers in comparison with industrial dryers which process much larger quantity of material that extends the time for dissipation of heat from the dried product. Present results indicated that when extended RT was simulated after drying liquid plasma with a lab dryer at temperatures around 71 or 80\u00b0C, there was a significant reduction in survival of both Salmonella spp. strains that was directly related with the higher RT regardless of outlet drying temperature. These results may confirm that commercial dryers may be more effective than lab dryers to inactivate micro\u2010organisms as suggested by Perdana et al. (2013).",

Some pathogens, especially bacteria and enveloped viruses, are not able to survive for prolonged periods of time in dry materials like SDBP (Sampedro et al. 2015). Several mechanisms affecting microbial survival in dry materials have been described, such as, oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species formation which produces lipid peroxidation, and the browning reaction of sugars that cause protein denaturation and DNA damage. These changes are accumulative and have lethal effects on bacterial metabolism (Hern\u00e1ndez Garc\u00eda 2011). Therefore, as an additional safety feature, most manufacturers pack and store porcine SDBP at room temperature (>20\u00b0C) for at least 14 days before release for sale. These storage conditions have been demonstrated as effective to inactivate certain pathogens susceptible to dry environments and mild temperatures, such as PRRSV, PEDV and coronaviruses in general (Pujols and Segal\u00e9s 2014; Sampedro et al. 2015).

Three 2 kg aliquots were obtained from the 6\u00b76 kg of diluted plasma for spray\u2010drying. A 10\u2010ml inoculum of each bacterium containing around 1010\u20131012 CFU ml\u22121 was prepared and used to inoculate each 2\u00b70 kg aliquot of plasma to achieve a minimum final titre of approximately 108\u20131010 CFU ml\u22121. This procedure was conducted in triplicate for each bacterium and was done in a sterile biological safety cabinet to avoid external contamination.",
