In the past few decades, newly evolved Coronaviruses have posed a global threat to public health. The immune response is essential to control and eliminate CoV infections, however, maladjusted immune responses may result in immunopathology and impaired pulmonary gas exchange. Gaining a deeper understanding of the interaction between Coronaviruses and the innate immune systems of the hosts may shed light on the development and persistence of inflammation in the lungs and hopefully can reduce the risk of lung inflammation caused by CoVs. In this review, we provide an update on CoV infections and relevant diseases, particularly the host defense against CoV-induced inflammation of lung tissue, as well as the role of the innate immune system in the pathogenesis and clinical treatment.",

It mainly activates the transcription factors NF-kB and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathways to induce inflammatory factors' expression. 6 Unlike MyD88, TRIF is an adapter protein of TLR3 and TLR4, which activates the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-kB to induce the expression of type I interferon and immuneinflammatory factors. The function of TRAM and TIRAP is to recruit TRIF molecules to the TLR4 receptor and MyD88 to the TLR2 and TLR4 receptors. Therefore, the TLR signaling pathways are classified as the MyD88-dependent pathway, which functions to activate immuneinflammatory factors, and the TRIF-dependent pathway, which functions to activate the type I interferons and inflammatory factors. 6 After a TLR is activated by the corresponding PAMP, MyD88 recruits the busy-1 F I G U R E 1 Coronavirus particle. Coronaviruses are enveloped, nonsegmented, positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus genomes in the size ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases. The virion has a nucleocapsid composed of genomic RNA and phosphorylated nucleocapsid (N) protein, which is buried inside phospholipid bilayers and covered by the spike glycoprotein trimmer (S). The membrane (M) protein (a type III transmembrane glycoprotein) and the envelope (E) protein are located among the S proteins in the virus envelope receptor-related kinases IRAK4, IRAKI, IRAK2, and IRAK-M.

IRAK interacts with TRAF6, which causes its K-63 ubiquitination, and facilitates NEMO ubiquitination to activate NF-kB. TRIFdependent pathways activate IRF3 and NF-kB. 8, 9 In addition to activating NF-kB, TRIF-dependent pathways, they also activate IRF3 and interferon-\u03b2. 10 This process leads to T cell activation and differentiation, including the production of cytokines associated with the different T cell subsets (ie, Th17), followed by a massive release of cytokines for immune response amplification. The continued production of these mediators due to viral persistence has a negative effect on NK, and CD8 T cell activation. However, CD8 T cells produce very effective mediators to clear CoV. B, Attachment of CoV to DPP4R on the host cell through S protein leads to the appearance of genomic RNA in the cytoplasm. An immune response to dsRNA can be partially generated during CoV replication. TLR-3 sensitized by dsRNA and cascades of signaling pathways (IRFs and NF-\u03baB activation, respectively) are activated to produce type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines. The production of type I IFNs is important to enhance the release of antiviral proteins for the protection of uninfected cells. Sometimes, accessory proteins of CoV can interfere with TLR-3 signaling and bind the dsRNA of CoV during replication to prevent TLR-3 activation and evade the immune response. TLR-4 might recognize S protein and lead to the activation of proinflammatory cytokines through the MyD88-dependent signaling pathway. Virus-cell interactions lead to the strong production of immune mediators. The secretion of large quantities of chemokines and cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-21, TNF-\u03b2, and MCP-1) is promoted in infected cells in response to CoV infection. These chemokines and cytokines, in turn, recruit lymphocytes and leukocytes to the site of infection. Red lines refer to inhibitory effects. Green lines refer to activating effects nucleocapsid proteins containing triphosphine RNA at the 5\u2032-end can be recognized by RIG-I. 17 The double-stranded RNA with doublebasic acid at the 5\u2032-end can be recognized by RIG-I. 18 When the viral 5\u2032-terminal triphosphate end is recognized by the CTD structure, the ATP-dependent conformational change brings the CTD structure to form a complex with the double-stranded RNA, and the CARD structure is then released from its self-inhibition and interacts with MAVS. 19 MDA5 recognizes RNAs of picornaviruses, including poliovirus (PV) and Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV).

At 9 O'clock, 7 January 2020, the virus was identified as a novel coronavirus and officially named by the WHO as 2019-nCoV, the new coronavirus in 2019. 1 On 22 January 2020, a total of 314 confirmed case have been reported, and 6 patients were reported to have died. 2 On 13, 16, and 21 January, respectively, Thailand, Japan, and Korea confirmed the detection of a human infection with 2019-nCoV from China. 2 In recent years, novel coronaviruses emerge periodically in different areas around the world. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) occurred in 2002, which reportedly infected 8422 people and caused 916 deaths worldwide during the epidemic. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in 2012, bringing a total of 1401 MERS-CoV infections, and 543 (~39%) of which died. 3-5 All the infection cases and recent epidemics show that coronaviruses impose a continuous threat to human beings and the economy as they emerge unexpectedly, spread easily, and lead to catastrophic consequences. Coronaviruses are enveloped, nonsegmented, positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus genomes in the size ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases, the largest known viral RNA genome. The virion has a nucleocapsid composed of genomic RNA and phosphorylated nucleocapsid (N) protein, which is buried inside phospholipid bilayers and covered by two different types of spike proteins: the spike glycoprotein trimmer (S) that can be found in all CoVs, and the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) that exists in some CoVs. The membrane (M) protein (a type III transmembrane glycoprotein) and the envelope (E) protein are located among the S proteins in the virus envelope. CoVs were given their name based on the characteristic crown-like appearance. The structure of CoV virion is shown in",

The\u03b2-coronavirus can be further classified into four viral lineages, namely lineage A-D. There are nearly 30 recognized CoVs that infect humans, mammals, fowl, and other animals. Human CoV infections are caused by \u03b1and \u03b2-CoVs. CoVs are common human pathogens, and 30% to 60% of the Chinese population is positive for anti-CoV antibodies. The viral infections are generally associated with upper respiratory tract infections, of which the signs and symptoms commonly include fever, headache, and cough; some patients may have lower respiratory tract infections. In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections may remain asymptomatic in the early stage until severe pneumonia, dyspnea, renal insufficiency, and even death (Figure 2). Histopathological observations of pulmonary lesions in SARS cases not only show nonspecific inflammatory responses such as edema and inflammatory cell infiltration but also exhibit severe exfoliation of alveolar epithelial cells, alveolar septal widening, damage to alveolar septa, and alveolar space infiltration in a distinctly organized manner. Pathologically, inflammation includes degeneration (necrosis), infiltration, and hyperplasia. Thus, SARS-CoV infection can cause pathological changes, degeneration, infiltration, and hyperplasia. Damage to the pulmonary interstitial arteriolar walls indicates that inflammatory response plays an important role throughout the course of disease in spites of the pathogenic effect of CoVs. Although the pathologies of SARS and MERS are not yet fully understood, viral and host factors play a key role in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections. During virus infection, host factors trigger an immune response against the virus. However, it should be noted that immunopathogenesis is associated with an immune response out of control, which may result in pulmonary tissue damage, functional impairment, and reduced lung capacity. Chemotactic factors are essential to the immune responses against the virus infections, given their regulatory effect on dilations and positions of leukocytes in the host lungs. Therefore, spectral changes in chemotactic factors may lead to severely maladjusted immune responses. Immune insufficiency or misdirection may increase viral replication and cause tissue damages. In contrast, overactive immune responses may induce immunopathological conditions. In this review article, we provide an analysis of the role of cytokines secreted upon CoV infections and their potentially detrimental contribution to the damages of the respiratory tract and other tissues.",

Due to its motif structure in the intracellular region with multiple signaling pathways, the CLR receptor has a wide range of functions, including cell adhesion, induction of endocytosis, phage, tissue repair, platelet activation, and natural immune responses. There are two main ways of CLR receptor activation in the cells. The first type is direct activation, such as macrophage-induced Mincle and CLEC4E receptors, and Dectin-2 (CLEC6A) receptors. The second type is to activate the receptor by activating HAM-like motifs in the intracellular tail of the receptor, such as Dectin-1 (CLEC7A) and DNGR-1 (CLEC9A).28,29 Both mechanisms involve the recruitment of acidified spleen tyrosine kinases, which in turn promotes CARD9, B-cell lymphoid tissue 10 (BcL10), and Maltl complex formation. At the same time, apoptosis-related granule-like proteins, including ASC, is acidified by SyK and JNK,30 and PKCS is also a key essential element in the pathway.31 The signaling pathways activate downstream molecules, including NF-kB and MAPKs, and trigger a variety of cellular responses, including cell phagocytosis, maturation of DC cells, and chemotaxis of cells.31 2.6 | Cytoplasmic DNA receptorExogenous microbial DNAs are recognized by host DNA receptors. In addition to TLR9 in the TLR family, Cytoplasmic DNA receptor (CDR) can recognizes DNA CpG islands. 32 More than 10 CDRs distributed in the cytoplasm have been identified, including AIM2-like receptors (ALRs), DNA-dependent activator of IFN-regulatory factor (DAI), interference stimulator of interferon gene (STING), leucine-rich repeat flightless-interacting protein 1 (LRRFIP1), DExD/H-box RNA helicase (DDX), Meiotic recombinant protein 11 Homolog A (MRE11), RNA polymerase III (Pol III), DNA dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), DNA repair-related proteins Rad50, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), and Sry-related HMG box 2 (Sox2). 4,32,33 DAI recognizes Z-type DNA and B-type DNA, which does not depend on sequence specificity, but on the length of DNA. 34,35 AIM2 is mainly involved in the recognition of double-stranded DNA.

The signaling pathways induce downstream IFNs production. 42 Upon infecting plasma-like dendritic cells (pDCs), the viral nucleic acids are recognized by TLR7/TLR9 to induce the production of inflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs mediated by NF-\u03baB and IRF7. 43,44 VSV infection induces miR-146a expression in macrophages through the LI ET AL.",

            "text": "Dendritic cells (DCs) play a key role in innate immune and adaptive immune responses. As the strongest antigen-presenting cells in the organism, they effectively stimulate the activation of T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes, thus combining innate and adaptive immunity. Immature DCs have strong migration ability, and mature DCs can effectively activate T cells in the central link of start-up, regulation, and maintenance of immune responses. Thus, once the maturation process of DCs is blocked, it directly affects the initiation of subsequent adaptive immune responses. 53-55 DC precursor cells differentiate into DCs by adding such inducers as GM-CSF, IL-4, and TNF-\u03b1. 56 However, DC precursor cells cannot differentiate into DCs if transfected with HIV-1 Nef protein in the presence of the inducers, indicating that Nef blocks the differentiation of DC precursor cells into mature DCs. Both the core protein and NS3 protein of HCV inhibit the expression of CD1a, CD1b, and DC-SIGN molecules on human peripheral blood mononuclear precursor cells (PBMCs), which play an important role in the development of peripheral blood mononuclear precursor cells to DCs. 57 In addition, HIV-1 attenuates the major histocompatibility antigen I (MHC I) on the surface of DCs, thereby reducing the ability of DCs to present the viral antigens. HIV-1 infection enhances the expression of DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrity (DC-SIGN), thus inhibiting CC chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) and MHC-II, which are important receptors of DC homing. 58,59 These results indicate that virus infection interferes with the differentiation and function of DCs, hinders the subsequent adaptive immune response mediated by DCs, and makes the virus evade the adaptive immune response of the host successfully.",

However, CD8+ T cells are cytotoxic and can kill viral infected cells. CD8+ T cells account for about 80% of total infiltrative inflammatory cells in the pulmonary interstitium in SARS-CoVinfected patients and play a vital role in clearing CoVs in infected cells and inducing immune injury. 74 In addition, by comparing T-cell-deficient BALB/c mice (transduced by ad5-hdp4) with controls and B-cell-deficient mice, some researchers determined that T cells could survive in the infected lungs and destroy the infected cells. 75 It emphasizes the important role of T cells rather than B cells in the control of pathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection. A cross-reactive T cell response leads to a decrease in MERS-CoV. 76 However, CD4+ T cells are more susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. The depletion of CD8+ T cells do not affect and delay viral replication at the time of infection with SARS-CoV. 77,78 Depletion of CD4+ T cells is associated with reduced pulmonary recruitment of lymphocytes and neutralizing antibody and cytokine production, resulting in a strong immune-mediated interstitial pneumonitis and delayed clearance of SARS-CoV from lungs. 79 Additionally, T helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines via the NF-kB signaling pathway. 80 IL-17 cytokines recruit monocytes and neutrophils to the site of infection with inflammation and activate other downstream cytokine and chemokine cascades, such as IL-1, LL-6, IL-8, IL-21, TNF-\u03b2, and MCP-1. 81,82On the other hand, MERS-CoV induces T cell apoptosis by activating the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways. A novel BH3-like region located in the C-terminal cytosolic domain of SARS-CoV protein mediates its binding to Bcl-xL and induced T-cell apoptosis.83 During the later stage of infection, depletion of T cells having antiviral effects may prolong the infection and promote viral survival.84",

            "text": "years, profound understandings of the innate immune response to viruses have been made. This type of immune response inhibits virus replication, promotes virus clearance, induces tissue repair, and triggers a prolonged adaptive immune response against the viruses. In most cases, pulmonary and systemic inflammatory responses associated with CoVs are triggered by the innate immune system when it recognizes the viruses. Although a broadly protective, universal vaccine is considered the ultimate protection against the virus spread, vaccine development can be time-consuming. To fulfill the pressing need, we should propose effective therapeutic measures using the accumulated knowledge of the innate immune response system. Targeted immunotherapy is a good alternative to some antivirals that have narrow treatment windows and meet with drug resistance easily. In 2003, glucocorticoid was widely used in SARS treatment to control pulmonary infection by regulating inflammatory responses. Except for viral pathogenicity, the inflammatory response of the body also plays a crucial role in SARS-induced lung injury cases. Therefore, in CoV pneumonia cases, it is important to control cytokine production and inflammatory response, given that they are responsible for the accumulation of cells and fluids. This strategy is challenging as we have not yet clearly identified any features in an immune response that can be inhibited specifically without compromising the beneficial host defense. However, accomplishing this is not impossible. Notable achievements have been made in analyzing detrimental and protective mechanisms. For instance, completely blocking a proximal event in the immune response (eg, activation of IFN response-related PRRs) seems unwise considering its general role in regulating the host defense. In contrast, more limited and specific effector arms, such as controlled production of oxygen radicals, NET formation, IL-1, IL-4, IL -6, IL-8, and IL-21 production, are probably practicable targets. At last, further research is needed to improve the understanding of the temporal features of CoV-induced inflammatory response in relation to the timing of therapeutic interventions.",
