Although coronaviruses have been shown to possess proofreading ability [1], relatively high mutation rates mean that coronaviruses are one of the most diverse, genetically distinct, and recently emerging groups of viruses. The emergence of these viruses are mainly triggered by the virus evolution which could occur due to high mutational rates, selection pressure on genetic diversity, inter- and intra-host selection, frequency of recombination, and genetic drifts during transmission bottlenecks. Within subfamily Coronaviridae, Alphacoronaviruses, and Betacoronaviruses infect and cause diseases in mammals, whereas Gammacoronaviruses are mainly avian specific [2].",

BCoV causes infections both in respiratory and enteric systems in cattle of all ages. Like other coronaviruses, BCoV exhibit high genetic mutations (one mutation per genome per replication round) [4, 5]. The nucleotide (nt) substitutions per site per year were found to be 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22124, 6.1 \u00d7 10\u22124, and 3.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), S, and N genes, respectively [6\u20138]. Due to their evolutionary potential, BCoVs have been isolated from humans (BCoV-like human enteric coronavirus HECV-4408/US/94) and a recently isolated canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) has also shown a high genetic similarity to Betacoronavirus1 [9, 10].",

Before beginning the analyses enable the \u201cAllow overwriting of log files\u201d option. Then press \u201cRun\u201d and the analysis will begin.After few moments, depending upon the processing capacity of the operating system and the size of the data, the chain will begin to run. There will be seven columns that extend vertically. Every column is one of the parameters that are being estimated; however, the first and the last column are crucial to observe. The first column is the generation being sampled in every moment (every chain has ten million steps) and the last column shows how many millions of states will be run per hour (remember, ten million steps per chain). Depending on the length of the chain, the length of the sequences, and the number of sequences to be analyzed, it may take variable time to complete the run.Once the chain has run, it is required to store the parameters. Close the BEAST window and open the BEAST folder. Every time a chain is run, two files are generated:. xml file and several ends (.log and. tre). Once the first run is complete, change the name of the. log and. tre files. For example, after the completion of a run for BCoV_S_gene_align.xml, BCoV_S_gene_align.log and BCoV_S_gene_align.tre files will be generated. Rename these two files to BCoV_S_gene_align1.log and BCoV_S_gene_align1.tre.Run the BCoV_S_gene_align.xml at least for two more times (steps 2\u20135).Finally, three different. log files and. tre files will be available labelled as BCoV_S_gene_align1.log, BCoV_S_gene_align2.log, and BCoV_S_gene_align3.log. These three files contain the estimations of the substitution rate that have to be summarized in TRACER.To summarize the run, open the TRACER program and select the option \u201cFile\u201d and \u201cInput Trace file\u201d, and open the first \u20261.log file from the folder, followed by the addition of the second (\u20262.log) file.

Select the option \u201cCombined\u201d from the Trace Files (Upper left) and the estimations that will appear on the traces table are the main estimations for all the parameters (see\nNote\n11). Generally, the desired parameters are:\nTree Model Root: This is the number of years that passed after the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA). Subtract this number from the most modern date to yield the TMRCA for the dataset.\nClock Rate: This is directly the rate of evolution in substitution/site/year.\n\n",

            "text": "\nThis protocol is optimized for Mac OS X; however, all the software packages and tools used here are also available for Windows which can be installed using recommended methodologies. All the software used here are Open Access, which do not require any subscription for any operating systems. These software packages are only for demonstration purposes, and there may be alternative solutions for the same purpose. The overall time of the data analysis depends upon processing power of the operating system and the number and length of sequences in the dataset.The same phylogenetic tree can be used for different interpretations. Failing to create a proper objective can lead to drawing incorrect conclusions from phylogenetic studies. It is therefore essential to define the objective for the downstream analyses before initiating the study.Construction of datasets depends on the objectives. One of the most common interests of bioinformaticians is to determine the epidemiological linking of the query sequence to that of sequences reported from the world and are available in the public domains. For this purpose, the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) is the most widely used tool, primarily owing to its speed of execution. Search the nucleotide sequences with objective-based keyword such as \u201cBovine Coronaviruses S gene\u201d. Manual editing and investigations of the downloaded sequences are always suggested. Notably, BLAST-Explorer is primarily aimed at helping the construction of sequence datasets for further phylogenetic study, and it can also be used as a standard BLAST server with enriched output. Use BLAST or BLAST-Explorer or other suitable database for construction of datasets.There are different algorithms for DNA sequence alignment with variable degrees of utility. In this protocol, ClustalW was used for simplicity. Any other algorithm can be used depending upon the preferences and interest.Nexus format is required input for MrBayes. Different tools, both online and offline, can be used to generate appropriate nexus output. We have only presented two commonly used and easily achievable methods.Detailed demonstration for tree annotation is described in our earlier publication [11].The file used for phylogenetic analysis may contain all available sequences in the public domain, which increases the size of the file significantly. However, depending upon the objective in mind, the datasets can be modified accordingly. For the larger datasets, the compiled data will be emailed to the email address provided once ready. This is also important to keep a record for future use.The cut point is calculated to be zero. All sites showing cumulated dN-dS values above 0 are under positive pressure whereas values below 0 are under negative pressure.The nature of parameter selection and interpretation is complex and is beyond the scope of this protocol. Please consult developers\u2019 published report for thorough understating of the concepts and applications [12].The parameters of the BEAST run are crucial and can determine the nature of output and may heavily influence the results. However, normally the default parameters are used [13].When summarizing the BEAST results, do not use the mean as it appears in the output (this is the arithmetic mean); instead use the geometric mean that appears in the summary statistic table (Right Upper). From a methodological point of view this is much more correct (Click on every parameter in the Tracer table and the summary statistic table for every parameter will change).\n",
