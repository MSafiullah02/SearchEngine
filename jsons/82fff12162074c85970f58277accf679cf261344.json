However, shortage of reagents has made NPS collection challenging, and alternative samples need to be explored. Due to its non-invasive nature, saliva has considerable diagnostic potential. Therefore, to guide diagnostic laboratories globally, we conducted a systematic review to determine the utility of saliva for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. A systematic search of major databases (PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar) was performed to identify published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. There was a total of 10 publications that fit the criteria for review. Most studies collected drooled whole saliva from hospitalized patients or pipetted saliva from intubated patients. Saliva was positive in 31-92% of patients depending on the cohort and length of hospitalization. Viral loads in saliva are comparable to those in NPS and ranged from 9.9 \u00d7 10 2 to 1.2 \u00d7 10 8 copies/mL during the first week of symptoms and decrease over time. Saliva can be positive up to 20 days post-symptom onset with viral loads correlating with symptom severity and degree of tissue damage. Based on these findings, we made suggestions to guide the clinical laboratory and suggest the need for diagnostic accuracy studies for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from saliva.",

The high demand of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), and the low supply of laboratory reagents and test kits highlight the need for alternative methods to facilitate accurate universal screening of COVID-19. The aetiological agent of COVID-19 is the novel Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which originated in Hubei Province, China (1, 2) . SARS-CoV-2 is a large, roughly spherical, enveloped virus, with a non-segmented positive-sense strand RNA genome ~30 kb in length (3) . Since the initial outbreak, clinical symptoms have ranged from mild to severe atypical pneumonia with the disease spreading through human-to-human transmission (1) . With an estimated incubation period of 5.1 days, and less than 2.5% of individuals displaying symptoms within 2.2 days of exposure, asymptomatic spread is possible, especially in children and healthy adults (4) . The community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, especially asymptomatic spread, can be detrimental to both acute care hospitals and community settings, such as nursing homes. Therefore, robust diagnostics algorithms for SARS-CoV-2 are essential to quarantine infected individuals to prevent the spread of disease.",

In most comparative studies, drooled saliva had higher positivity rates than deep saliva/sputum and was useful from initial screening to intubation. Positivity of saliva was 31-92% depending on the cohort and length of hospitalization. Viral load in saliva was highest during the first week of symptom onset, ranging from 9.9 \u00d7 10 2 to 1.2 \u00d7 10 8 copies/mL, and then gradually declined (9, 14) . At initial screening viral loads and positivity rates were comparable to NPS, but one study found salivary loads were five-times higher than in NPS (15) . Higher salivary viral loads were also found in patients with more severe disease (16) and correlated to tissue damage (17). In a study screening 98 asymptomatic health care workers all NPS were negative, but two were positive in saliva (15) .",

SARS-CoV-2 infects human epithelial cells through the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2), which is expressed on cells lining the lungs, oral buccal and gingiva (19) . This infectious virion is both detectable in saliva and culturable on Vero E6 cells making saliva both a non-invasive sample that is easy to collect but also a potential exposure risk for front-line healthcare workers (9) . SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in a variety of oral samples, including whole saliva, oral swabs, oropharyngeal swabs, and deep saliva/sputum. There is a wide range of commercially available saliva collection devices but given the high sampling demand and limited stocks of swabs, 1-3 mL of unstimulated whole saliva expectorated into a sterile urine container or 50 mL conical tube is the easiest and most reliable sample to collect, unless the patient is a hyposalivator or intubated.",

If a patient is having difficulty salivating rubbing the outside of the cheek may help. As sample positivity is essential in hospitalized patients, due to the effect of diurnal variation on levels of salivary biomarkers, two studies collected saliva first thing in the morning prior to food or brushing of teeth (14, 15) . The other studies did not account for circadian rhythm, but found the viral load to be highest in saliva for the first week after the onset of symptoms, suggesting that adequate salivary samples can be collected at anytime. However, due to salivary enzymes, it is essential, especially if samples require transportation, that whole saliva be chilled immediately after collection (e.g. shipped on ice packs)",

Processing saliva can be laborious as viscosity varies greatly and samples high in mucin can clog spin columns and automated extractors. To overcome this problem, several studies mixed saliva in 2 mL VTM or PBS prior to extraction. As saliva contains cell-free infectious virion, it may be possible to centrifuge the saliva collected in sterile 50 mL conical tubes at 2,800 x g,10-minutes, 4 o C, aspirate the supernatant, and proceed with extraction(22). Small samples (1-2 mL) can be centrifuged at 13,000 x g, 4 minutes, 4 o C in microcentrifuge tubes. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA can then be performed with any validated LDT or commercially available assay(5). Subsequent whole genome analysis on positives using Oxford Nanopore MinION or by bait capture hybridization probes coupled with Illumina sequencing for surveillance and outbreak analysis(14,23).The utility of saliva for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 appears clinically useful, but controlled diagnostic accuracy studies comparing saliva to matched NPS in positive and negative patients are desperately needed. As outlined by the US FDA, the use of saliva for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 requires a clinical study comparing whole saliva to NPS collected at the same time from a minimum of 30 positive/30 negative pairs with discordant results resolved with further testing(24). Similar validations could also be performed for other types oral fluids. Future studies could also compare salivary and serum IgG as a screen for immunity (25). studies must be performed as soon as possible to help direct the clinical laboratory in the fight against COVID-19.",
