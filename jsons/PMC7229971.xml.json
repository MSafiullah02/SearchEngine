We then compared these to the results from the same period in 2019. All cases with excessive elevation of the INR (>8.0) were selected. Data was collated from the anticoagulant clinic record and electronic patient records, which included patient characteristics, INR test frequency, drug compliance, co-medications, and changes in diet and alcohol intake as well as patient-reported events including bleeding. Bleeding events were defined by ISTH criteria [3,4]. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to compare the incidence of high INRs during each time period. Root cause analysis was performed according to routine clinical practice, and the results reviewed by a panel of three in-house anticoagulation specialists. COVID-19 was defined as a risk factor for a high INR reading if the disease was possible or confirmed [5].",

The reasons for this are likely multifactorial, however more than half of our cases had COVID-19 (possible or confirmed) and/or antibiotic use. The use of antibiotics in patients with COVID-19 appears to be common. Given the high prevalence of COVID-19 in the community, it is important to reinforce the need for prescribers of antibiotics and patients to maintain good channels of communication with anticoagulation clinics regarding co-prescribing of interacting drugs. Subclinical derangements of coagulation and liver impairment have been reported in COVID-19 which might contribute to the problem [6,7]. Reduced vitamin K status has also been reported in patients with COVID-19 [8]; this could be associated with malabsorption due to small bowel COVID-19 involvement and/or reduced dietary intake. Other potential contributory factors include decreased access to green leafy vegetables due to stockpiling [9], increased alcohol consumption [10], and increased paracetamol prescribing may too have increased warfarin sensitivity during lockdown [11]. Furthermore, the psychological impact of social distancing and bereavement may have affected adherence to regular medications during this period [12].",
