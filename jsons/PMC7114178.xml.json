In the United States, PRRS alone costs an estimated $560 million in losses per year to the swine industry (Neumann et al., 2005). The etiologic agent of PRRS was first isolated on porcine alveolar macrophages in Europe in 1991 and this isolate was designated as Lelystad virus (LV) (Wensvoort et al., 1991). In 1992, a similar virus was isolated on an MA104-derived cell line, CL 2621, in the U.S. and the isolate was ATCC VR-2332 (Collins et al., 1992). The most recent outbreaks occurred in Vietnam and China (Normile, 2007). PRRSV is classified as a member of the family Arteriviridae (Meulenberg et al., 1993).",

North American and European isolates were found to have approximately 67% homology at the nucleotide sequence level. The genome of PRRSV is about 15 kb in length. It has a cap structure at its 5\u2032 end and a poly(A) tail at its 3\u2032 end (Meng et al., 1994, Meulenberg et al., 1998). The genome contains nine ORFs and the genome organization starts with the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), followed by nine open reading frames (ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF2a, ORF2b, and ORFs 3\u20137) and 3\u2032 UTR. ORFs 1a and 1b are located at the 5\u2032 end of the genome and comprise about 80% of the genome. ORF1a and ORF1b encode viral replicase as a polyprotein, which is proteolytically processed to 12 mature nonstructural proteins (NSPs) by virus-encoded proteases (Fang et al., 2004).",

PRRS remains the most economically important disease for swine industry though a commercial vaccine has been available for more than a decade. The high mutation rate of PRRSV replication, the high prevalence of PRRSV infection, and the lack of a broadly protective vaccine suggest the need to explore alternative strategies for PRRS control. We have demonstrated that phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) can be effective antiviral against PRRSV (Patel et al., 2008, Zhang et al., 2006). Several PMOs targeted at the 5\u2032 terminal region of PRRSV genome have been shown to be effective in inhibiting PRRSV replication in cells in a sequence-specific and dose-dependent manner.",

            "text": "PMO is structurally similar to single-stranded DNA in that each subunit includes a purine or pyramidine base. However, in PMO, each base is joined to a novel backbone consisting of one morpholine ring and phosphorodiamidate linkage per subunit (Summerton and Weller, 1997). PMO is uncharged, water-soluble, and highly resistant to nuclease degradation. PMO binds to target mRNA by Watson\u2013Crick base pairing and exerts an antisense effect by preventing access to critical segments of RNA sequence, such as a translation initiation site, through steric blockade. This is a distinctly different process from the RNase H-dependent mechanism induced by the often-used antisense structural type phosphorothioate DNA (Summerton, 1999). PMO that are conjugated with short arginine-rich cell penetrating peptides has displayed a higher efficiency in delivery into cultured cells (Moulton and Moulton, 2004). This peptide-conjugated PMO (PPMO) has been found to be fairly stable in cells and human serum for at least 24 h (Youngblood et al., 2007). The sequence-specific antiviral efficacy of peptide-conjugated PMO compounds has been documented against a number of viruses in animal models, including PPMO against Ebola virus (Enterlein et al., 2006, Warfield et al., 2006), Coxsackievirus B3 (Yuan et al., 2006), murine coronavirus (Burrer et al., 2007), Dengue virus (Stein et al., 2008), and West Nile virus (Deas et al., 2007, Deas et al., 2005).",

The PCR product was digested with NheI and SalI and subcloned into a luciferase reporter vector PciNeoLuc, as described previously (Zhang et al., 2006). This cloning placed the PRRSV 5\u2032 UTR upstream of the luciferase coding sequence. DNA sequencing was performed to confirm the presence of the desired sequence in the resulting plasmid, PciNeoLuc-5UTR. The plasmid DNA was linearized downstream of the luciferase gene with NotI. In vitro transcription was conducted with T7 RiboMAX\u2122 Express Large Scale RNA Production System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In vitro translations were carried out by rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate Translation System (Promega) with 2 \u03bcg transcribed RNA. A series of dilutions of 1, 5, 50 and 100 nM of PPMO 5UP1, 7P1, and CP1 were tested. Combinations of 5UP1 at 1 or 5 nM with 7P1 or CP1 at 5, 50 and 100 nM were compared to the mock-treatment control (no PPMO). A control without RNA and PPMO was also included in the translation assay. The luciferase yield under the absence or presence of the PPMOs was measured by the Bright-Glo\u2122 Luciferase Assay System (Promega) with VICTOR3\u2122 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Science, Wellesley, MA). Luminescence signal in test samples was expressed as relative percentage of that in the mock-treated control reaction.",

This experiment was repeated three times and similar results were observed each time. These results demonstrated that combination of 5UP1 (0.5 \u03bcM) with 4P1 or 7P1 (8 or 16 \u03bcM) was more effective in inhibiting PRRSV replication than a constituent individual PPMO of the pairs.

This region is believed to be critical in the pre-initiation of translation of viral genomic RNA (Van Den Born et al., 2004). Previous work at this lab has demonstrated that treatment of CRL11171 cells with 16 \u03bcM 5UP1 led to a significant reduction in PRRSV minus-strand RNA synthesis (Zhang et al., 2006). To assess the effect of PPMO combination on PRRSV RNA synthesis, CRL11171 cells were treated with the two pairs of PPMO combinations, 5UP1 + 4P1 and 5UP1 + 7P1 and harvested at 40 h p.i. for RNA isolation. The 5UP1 PPMO was used at the concentration of 0.5 \u03bcM, while 4P1 or 7P1 was tested at two different concentrations of 8 and 16 \u03bcM. Real-time RT-PCR was performed to assess the levels of PRRSV genomic RNA. PPMO 5UP1 at the concentration of 0.5 \u03bcM had no effect on viral RNA level, consistent with virus yield titration. PPMO 4P1 or 7P1 at the concentration of 16 \u03bcM also did not lead to much reduction of viral RNA level when compared to that in mock-treatment control (Fig. 3\n). The combination of 5UP1 (0.5 \u03bcM) with 4P1 (16 \u03bcM) or 7P1 (8 or 16 \u03bcM) led to over 1000-fold (3 log10) reduction of viral RNA level (Fig. 3). Moderate reduction in viral RNA level was observed when the combination of 5UP1 (0.5 \u03bcM) with 4P1 (8 \u03bcM) was used. The results indicate the treatment with PPMO combination had enhanced effect on the inhibition of PRRSV RNA synthesis. It was noted that the 5UP1 and CP1 combination also slightly reduced the viral RNA level compared to the mock treatment, which is consistent with viral yield reduction shown in Fig. 2B. However, this reduction in viral RNA level was much smaller than that by combination of 5UP1 with 7P1 or 4P1.",

In this assay, PPMO binding to its target RNA was expected to inhibit its translation, leading to lower luciferase yield. Cell-free transcription and translation were conducted to assess the luciferase yield in the presence and absence of PPMO. In this test, the cellular uptake of PPMO was avoided and the direct effect of PPMO combination on target mRNA translation was determined. Different concentrations of PPMOs were used to determine dose-responsive reduction of luciferase yield. The 5UP1 at the concentrations of 5 and 50 nM resulted in the reduction of luciferase yield to 26% and 11%, respectively, compared to the mock-treatment control (Fig. 5A). The 7P1 at the concentrations of 5 and 50 nM resulted in the reduction of luciferase yield to 55% and 36%, respectively. When 1 nM 5UP1 was combined with 5 and 50 nM 7P1, the luciferase production was down to 44% and 32%, respectively. When 5 nM 5UP1 was combined with 5 and 50 nM 7P1, the luciferase production was down to 12% and 9%, respectively, which were far lower than that of each of these two PPMOs alone. When 5UP1 was combined with CP1, the luciferase yields were similar to the values of 5UP1 alone. The result demonstrated that the combination PPMO's enhanced effect on inhibition of target mRNA translation was sequence-specific.",

PPMO 5UP1 was tested at 2 and 0.5 \u03bcM, respectively. To our surprise, the combination of 5UP1 at 2 \u03bcM with all the other PPMOs tested completely inhibited VR2385 replication to below detection level, while 5UP1 alone at 2 \u03bcM had a little effect. This result suggests the enhanced effect of combination of two PPMOs. PPMO 5UP1 at the concentration of 0.5 \u03bcM was paired with 8 or 16 \u03bcM of the other PPMOs. Of the total six pairs in combination, two pairs, 5UP1 + 4P1 and 5UP1 + 7P1 showed effective inhibition of PRRSV replication. But individual PPMOs alone at the concentrations tested did not have inhibitory effect. Virus titration clearly demonstrated that 5UP1 combined with 4P1 or 7P1 was effective in a dose-responsive manner in inhibiting PRRSV production in infected cells. It is not clear whether the presence of 4P1 or 7P1 enhanced the blocking effect of 5UP1 or the PPMO pairs had the combinatory effect of blocking both PPMOs complementary sites. It is likely that the combinatory effect of blocking both target sites was responsible for the reduction of PRRSV replication since combination of 5UP1 with CP1 or the other PRRSV PPMOs did not have the enhanced effect. The reason that the other pairs were less effective is not clear, but could be due to inaccessibility of PRRSV target sequence or successful PPMO/target-RNA hybrid did not affect PRRSV replication. It is also speculated that GP4 and N proteins have essential roles in PRRSV replication. However, we do not have data to support this speculation since GP4 or N gene expression was not monitored and their roles in PRRSV replication are not well understood.",

The RNA level from the cells treated with the 5UP1 at 0.5 \u03bcM with 4P1 or 7P1 at 16 \u03bcM was about 2 log10, which was unexpected since the virus yield was below detection level. The possible reasons are that some replicase had already been produced at the time of PPMO treatment or that there was no complete virion production in the cells. The first speculation might be the case since the virus RNA translation initiates right after entry into the cells. It is expected that pretreatment of the cells with the PPMOs before virus inoculation would reduce the virus RNA translation. But our previous results showed that treatment post-virus inoculation led to stronger reduction of virus yield (Zhang et al., 2006). The second speculation is more plausible since the virus titration assay did not detect PRRSV from the cells treated with the two PPMO pairs. In addition to the inhibition at RNA level, the PPMO combination also led to inhibition of viral N protein expression. This result is consistent with the reduction of PRRSV genomic RNA level. The reduction of N protein in cells treated with 5UP1 + 4P1 indicates that PRRSV subgenomic RNA synthesis was reduced since 4P1 does not bind to subgenomic RNA7 and inhibit its translation.",

Binding of PPMO pair to their RNA target sites inhibits the translation of target mRNA that encodes luciferase. Our results indicated that 5UP1 + 7P1 displayed enhanced effect in inhibition of translation of luciferase reporter mRNA in a sequence-specific and dose-responsive manner. The 5UP1 + 7P1 combination showed much lower luciferase yield than either of the two PPMOs alone at the concentration tested, while 5UP1 + CP1 combination had no effect.

Due to its easy transmission and high variability of PRRSV, and the lack of a broadly protective vaccine, the control of this disease is difficult. Current vaccines available have limited effect, especially when used against the heterologous PRRSV strains, which are commonly found in outbreaks. PPMO combinations of 5UP1 + 4P1 and 5UP1 + 7P1 inhibited replication of 10 North American PRRSV strains in our cross-strain inhibition assay. Sequence alignment showed that PRRSV sequences targeted by these PPMOs are highly conserved. Analysis of PRRSV sequences from the GenBank indicates that the complementary sequences of 5UP1 and 7P1 are highly conserved across North American PRRSV strains (Patel et al., 2008). Thus, these two pairs of PPMOs have the potential for application against most North American PRRSV strains. It would be a plausible advantage to use PPMO combinations rather than a single PPMO in consideration of heterologous PRRSV strains in the field and potential benefit to have less chance in generation of escape mutant virus. Further investigation into the pharmacokinetic, toxicological, and antiviral properties of these PPMO combinations in vivo against heterologous PRRSV strains is warranted.",
