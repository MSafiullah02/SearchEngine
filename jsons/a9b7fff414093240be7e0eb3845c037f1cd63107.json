A wide spectrum of disease severity has been described, ranging from asymptomatic, mildly symptomatic, severe symptomatic requiring hospitalization, to respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Furthermore, it has been widely reported that the prevalence of the disease is almost three times higher in males. Overall, these evidences suggest that the prognosis appears to be more conditioned by the host's response than by the infection itself, thus a precision medicine approach is highly desirable. In cardiovascular diseases, an important source of inflammatory mediators, including IL-1\u03b2, is the visceral adipose tissue (4) . Of note, activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages attenuates uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) induction and mitochondrial respiration in cultures of primary adipocytes and the NLRP3 inflammasome activation appears to link obesity and dysfunctional thermogenesis (5).",

            "text": "Inflammatory responses and the entity of the cytokines storm produced by the infection seem to be variables potentially related to this huge clinical variability. In this view, a multicenter trial on tocilizumab (TOCIVID-19), a monoclonal antibody that competitively inhibits the binding of interleukin-6 (IL-6) to its receptor (IL-6R), is ongoing on Covid 19 patients with pneumonia. To our knowledge, there are no ongoing studies on the inhibition of IL-1.Evidence suggest that COVID-19 may have been originated in bats. Bats, the only flying mammals, have the ability to asymptomatically host a large number of high-profile viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses. It has been reported that fruit bats can be infected with bat SARS coronavirus without showing any sign of infection (1). In the 'pre-Covid 19 era' Ahn et al (2), demonstrated that the ability of bats to tolerate viral disease, even during a transient phase of high viral load, could be explained by a dampened NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3)-mediated inflammatory response. This supports the hypothesis that an enhanced innate immune tolerance rather than an enhanced antiviral defense can be the key point explaining different clinical scenarios in COVID-19. NLRP3 is a critical component of the innate immune system that detects a broad range of microbial motifs, endogenous danger signals and environmental irritants, mediating caspase-1 activation and 3 secretion of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2/IL-18 in response to microbial infection and cellular damage (3).Aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is involved in the pathophysiology of various diseases including diabetes, atherosclerosis and metabolic syndrome which have been shown all comorbidities associated to worse outcome in COVID-19. In this regard, Canakinumab, a therapeutic monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-1\u03b2, significantly lowers the rate of recurrent cardiovascular events in patients with a previous of myocardial infarction.",
