In addition, the greater diagnostic ability of TEE 4 remains operant in the prone position, as illustrated in our patient with a dynamic severe mitral regurgitation. Finally, TEE solely provides a constant window to the superior vena cava to assess preload responsiveness in ventilated patients 5 , even in prone position 3 . Since TEE assessment is more cumbersome to routinely perform than TTE, especially in the setting of COVID-19 epidemic, TTE may be used to properly select those patients who require TEE monitoring during prone ventilation.",

Hemodynamic assessment using transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is challenging in prone position because acoustic windows are limited and difficult to obtain. Although the sole apical four-chamber view remains informative to evaluate central hemodynamics and identify ventricular dysfunction, it is intrinsically limited for the accurate identification of acute cor pulmonale (ACP) which involves \u224820% of ARDS patients 2 . In contrast, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) maintains a full diagnostic capacity and can be used safely for hemodynamic assessment during prone ventilation 3 . Using TEE, we monitored five patients ventilated for severe COVID-19 ARDS who were deemed at risk of hemodynamic instability at the time of prone positioning. Initially, the TEE probe was introduced under direct laryngoscopic guidance to perform a comprehensive hemodynamic assessment in the supine position. Subsequently, the patient was turned in the prone position with particular attention to prevent any inadvertent dislodgement of both the endotracheal tube and TEE probe 3 . This allowed assessing potential hemodynamic consequences of body positioning due to abrupt changes in cardiac loading conditions and ventricular interactions. TEE probe was removed in the presence of stable hemodynamics in prone position. No complication was observed during or after TEE evaluations. In 60 % of these patients, TTE image quality was suboptimal or poor in the semirecumbent supine position under high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure. ACP was solely depicted by TEE in one patient in the supine position. One hour after prone positioning, the eccentricity index measured in the transgastric short-axis view returned to normal, from 1.6 to 1.05. In another patient with severe hemodynamic instability at 3 baseline, TTE was not contributory while TEE depicted a systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve associated with a severe mitral regurgitation. SAM was ascribed to both hypovolemia and septal hypertrophy. A 1.5-L fluid loading resulted in reduction of the regurgitant volume, and both the SAM and mitral regurgitation fully regressed in prone position (Figure 1). The three remaining patients kept a normal hemodynamic profile from the supine to prone position during TEE monitoring.",

Panel A: In the semi-recumbent supine position, a systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve is evidenced (white arrow). Panel B: this abnormality was associated with a severe mitral insufficiency as reflected by a large regurgitant jet using color Doppler mapping. Panel C: After a 1.5-L fluid resuscitation to correct underlying overt hypovolemia, the systolic anterior motion disappeared. Panel D: Associated mitral regurgitation fully regressed in the prone position, whereas an aliasing during color Doppler mapping indicated the persistence of a moderate left ventricular outflow tract obstruction related to localized septal hypertrophy. Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction measured in the deep transgastric five-chamber view using continuous wave Doppler decreased from 121 mmHg to 36 mmHg after both the fluid loading and prone positioning.",
