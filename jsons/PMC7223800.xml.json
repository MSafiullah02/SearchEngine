Studies have characterized the indoor environment as crucial to students\u2019 health and academic performance (Mendell and Heath 2005; Daisey et al. 2003). With higher occupant density and more crowded campuses, the potential for contact with biological pollutants and their transmission among infected students may be greater at Chinese universities than at universities in other developed countries. Therefore, assessment of indoor biological contaminants on university campuses has become extremely important in China. Numerous studies have evaluated the levels of airborne bacteria in various indoor environments at universities: classrooms (Bhangar et al. 2014; Qian et al. 2012; Chatzidiakou et al. 2012; Grisoli et al. 2012), archives (Nunes et al. 2013), libraries (Hayleeyesus and Manaye 2014; Kalwasinska et al. 2012), dormitory rooms (Hayleeyesus et al. 2015) and laboratories (Giulio et al. 2010; Priyamvada et al. 2018). Each of the above-mentioned studies on indoor airborne bacteria at universities focused mainly on a single type of environment. Few studies have evaluated bioaerosol concentrations in multiple indoor environments and assessed the pollutant levels across these environments (Li et al. 2015; Chan et al. 2008).",

Generally, the relationship between indoor and outdoor bacterial concentration (I/O ratio) has been considered an important index for evaluating the indoor bacterial concentration on various indoor concentrations. Li et al. (2015) reported that the I/O ratios for airborne bacteria were greater than 1 in a dining hall, a clinic and a dormitory, but not in classrooms. Kim and Kim (2007) found that I/O ratios for airborne bacteria ranged from 0.26 to 0.71 in tested buildings. The I/O ratios reported by Balasubramanian et al. (2012) ranged widely, from 0.43 to 11.8. Thus, there is no clear conclusion about the factors that influence indoor bacterial levels, or the relationship between indoor and outdoor concentration.",

Existing studies on exposure to indoor contaminants were conducted with an index known as the dose rate. For example, Castro et al. (2011) assessed the health risks of gas and particulate matter generated by tobacco smoke in indoor environments and determined the dose rates of the gas and particles. A similar study by Fonseca et al. (2014) employed the dose rate to assess ultrafine particles in preschools. Recently, Madureira et al. (2015) used the dose rate to investigate the health risk of indoor airborne bioaerosols. Furthermore, because of the infectious nature and diversity of biological pollutants, bioaerosol exposure in the indoor environment should be studied in greater depth. Moreover, most of the above-mentioned studies on exposure to indoor contaminants by dose rate were focused on particles and chemical components, while exposure to airborne bacteria has been investigated less frequently.",

Airborne bacteria data were collected in 12 classrooms (four of which had a seating capacity of about 200 students, four with a capacity of over 160, and four with a capacity of over 100) on three different floors in the academic building (activities: leaning, writing, reviewing and so on); 12 dormitories (activities: cleaning, walking, sleeping and so on) and four bathrooms (i.e., 12 living/sleeping rooms and four bathrooms in building A (female dormitory) and building B (male dormitory)), where each living/sleeping room had an area of about 16 m2; and a three-story dining hall (68.4 m (length) \u00d7 36 m (width)) (activities: eating, walking and so on). The selected classrooms were equipped with standard furniture, the dormitory rooms each contained two sets of bunk beds, and general seats and tables were placed in the dining hall (Fig. 1). The cleaning procedures of the teaching building and dining hall were made by cleaning company with the same type of products, while the cleaning procedures of dorms were made by students. All the sampling sites under investigation were naturally ventilated by opening windows and doors, and heated by a radiator system that was in operation during the heating period (from November 15 to March 15 of the following year). The layout of the university campus and the measured indoor environments is shown in Fig. 1.",

The airborne bacteria in the selected classrooms were tested at 7:40 am (before the first lecture), 9:50 am (after the first lecture) and 11:50 am (after the second lecture). For the dormitories, the times of 9:00, 13:00 and 20:00 were chosen as the sampling times for a typical day. Meanwhile, the biological contaminant concentration in the dining hall was measured at 10:00 (after breakfast), 12:40 (lunchtime), and 15:00 (before dinner) during the typical day. The sampling plates (90 mm diameter, three replicate plates at one sampling site) were placed on a desk or table at a distance of 0.8 m above the ground in the classrooms and dining hall, and directly on the ground in the dormitories for layout of dorms with the furniture placed by the side of room and empty in middle of room. The outdoor sites were located next to the selected rooms, at window height and away from the wall 1.0 m with three plates in triplicates. To avoid the influence of outdoor wind, the sampling plates were fixed in a shallow box with opening skylight (Fig. 2). Details of the outdoor climate description in the sampling days are listed in Table 2. Meteorological data (T, RH, WS, WD) are from weather China forecast (1-h update) of urban station and the multi-function ventilation meter (TSI 9565, US). The samples of temperature and RH were collected for 5 min by TSI 9565. The general description, temperature (Temp), relative humidity (RH), wind speed (WS) and wind direction (WD) of the ambient outdoor environment were also recorded, and the average values are provided (Table 2).",

The daily activity patterns of university students (including studying time, dinner time and dormitory time) were recorded and analyzed. The BRWa is determined by the intensity of the activity during the exposure time. BRWa of the students was indexed as 5.8 L/min (male), and 4.8 L/min (female) for sedentary activity, and 13.4 L/min (male), and 11.1 L/min (female) for light-intensity activity. BRWa values (male and female combined) of 5.3 L/min and 12.0 L/min were used for sedentary and light-intensity activity, respectively.

The CWa was based on the median bacterial concentration, and the OF was specified as 1 because of the close relationship between the students\u2019 schedules and their respective locations. During their classes, the students had similar schedules and activity patterns, spending about 8 h per day in classrooms, with a sedentary level for both males and females. Overall, the students were sedentary for 9 h per day (in the dormitories) and engaged in light-intensity activities for 2 h (in the dining halls).",

The mean and SD (standard deviation) of temperature of the tested indoor environments was 18.4 \u00b1 2.1 \u00b0C (range of 16.0\u201323.1 \u00b0C), and that of relative humidity was 44.7 \u00b1 8.1% (ranged from 35.1 to 60.0%). The concentration of indoor airborne bacteria varied greatly among the three types of indoor environment. As a result, as shown by a comparison of the three indoor types, the mean bacterial concentration was highest in the dormitories and lowest in the classroom on the ground floor. One possible explanation for this observation may be the more crowded and higher activity level of the students in the dormitories. This prediction is also supported by previous studies in which human activities were found to affect the airborne microbial concentration by means of re-suspension (Kim and Kim 2007; Mentese et al. 2009). In addition, by comparing the concentration of bacteria in school dormitories and nursing homes, Faridi et al. (2015) found that the concentration of bacteria in nursing old homes was higher, with the explanation of incapability to maintain their personal hygiene for older people. Similar reasons of our study, with regularly disinfected twice a week for canteen and no regulative activities in dormitory, resulted in the lower bacterial concentration of the canteen than that of the dormitory.",

Further analysis showed no statistically significant differences in the bacterial concentration in the classrooms among the different floors (p < 0.05). For evaluation of the level of contamination by indoor bacteria in the dormitories, the bacterial concentration in the dorms was compared with the results of previous field studies. The average bacterial concentrations in the 12 tested dormitory rooms are listed in Table 3. The indoor biological concentrations were 2.847 \u00b1 2.554 \u00d7 103 and 1.956 \u00b1 3.407 \u00d7 103 CFU/m3, respectively, measured in the dormitory rooms of female and male students. The mean airborne bacterial concentrations indoors were similar with the value (2345 CFU/m3) observed in a field study by Hayleeyesus et al. (2015). However, the minimum bacterial concentrations were lower than that reported by Hayleeyesus et al. (2015). This difference was due to the more number of students (4\u201326) per room in their study, compared with 1\u20135 persons in the present study. Because of leftover food that was present during the sampling process, a field study by Li et al. (2015) found that the indoor bacterial concentration was 1025 CFU/m3 in a dining hall, about two times the values in this study. Even though no reasonable comparison with the standard limited value was conducted in this study for the different sampling methods, the results indicate an acceptable level of exposure to indoor airborne bacteria (2500 CFU/m3, the threshold value for biological contaminant concentration in standard of China) (NSC 2002) during the testing period, with the exception of five of the dormitory rooms.",

The average indoor bacterial concentrations in the selected classrooms, measured at 7:00 (students entering, T1), 9:40 (the break of two lessons T2) and 11:40 (after class, T3), are displayed in Fig. 3. The average concentration of indoor bacteria during windy weather (ranging from 1.40 \u00d7 103 to 2.08 \u00d7 103 CFU/m3) was the highest among the three types of weather. The indoor bacterial concentration during sunny weather remained at the same level (about 0.5 \u00d7 103 CFU/m3) of the indoor concentration during snowy weather at tested times (Fig. 3). At a > 95% confidence level, further analysis of the data indicated statistically significant differences in the sunny\u2013windy and windy\u2013snowy comparisons, but not in the sunny\u2013snowy comparison. Possible causes for these findings may be the greater air change when natural ventilation was enhanced during windy weather, and the higher outdoor bacterial counts related to the meteorological factors of cloudiness and wind speed (Mentese and Tasdibi 2014). According to the tested results, the temperature of outdoor varied less than that of indoor during the sampling period, and higher RH of outdoor (68.5%) was gained than that of indoor (35.1%) without humidifier in snowy day. On the other hand, weather conditions are closely related to outdoor pollution (Du et al. 2018); the lower bacterial concentration of outdoor is gained in sunny and snowy day than windy day, for the better disinfection of UV light in sunny day and cleaning the air in snowy day. This may be a means of weather conditions affecting the outdoor bacteria concentration, which affect the indoor air bacteria through natural ventilation. Additionally, the various relative humidity and temperatures have been found to significantly influence airborne bacteria, which would also explain the variation in bacterial concentration with weather conditions.",

Throughout the day, no statistically significant differences were observed in the bacterial concentration in the tested dormitories at the three sampling times at a > 95% confidence level. The purpose of Fig. 4 is to highlight the impact of gender on the indoor bacterial environment in all the measured dormitories. In the early afternoon, because of similar activities (resting after lunch) on the part of the women and men, the indoor bacterial concentration is approximately the same in both dormitories. According to Luongo et al. (2016a), gender influences indoor bacterial communities significantly. Furthermore, cleaning activities may result in higher bacterial concentrations (Hayleeyesus et al. 2015). As shown in Fig. 4, the average concentrations in the female dormitories in the morning and evening were significantly higher than those in the male dormitories, which might have been due to more numerous material possessions (clothes, dresses, toys and so on) and more frequent cleaning by the women than the men. This finding disagrees with the traditional view that microbial contaminant levels in female dormitories would be lower than in male dormitories. Luongo et al. (2016a) have shown that the physiological difference between male and female leads to the significant difference of bacteria species in the dormitory. Different bacteria adapt to different environments; the particularity of the environment sampled in this study is one of the reasons that resulted in the higher bacterial concentration in female dorms than male dorms.",

The outdoor concentration (103 to 105 CFU/m3) was about ten times greater than the indoor concentration (102 to 104 CFU/m3). The indoor bacterial concentration depended strongly on the outdoor concentration (Meadow et al. 2014; Hospodsky et al. 2012), with similar change trends in the classrooms and dormitories, because of the natural ventilation. As a result of human activity and occupants, the indoor bacterial concentration changed more slowly with the outdoor concentration in the dormitories than in the classrooms. For further explanation, the relationship between indoor and outdoor bacteria is defined by Eq. (3) according to the balanced theory (the indoor concentration was equal to the supplying minus the exhausting, plus the internally generating) in a building under stable conditions with steady temperature, RH, air ventilation of indoor environments.3\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$C_{\\text{i}} = \\frac{S}{{\\left( {1 + n} \\right)V}} + \\frac{n}{1 + n}C_{\\text{o}} .$$\\end{document}Ci=S1+nV+n1+nCo.Ci and Co are the bacterial concentration indoors and outdoors, respectively; S is the indoor source; n is the air change rate, which could be estimated by the decay of carbon dioxide; and V is the room volume. Due to more occupants and human activity caused more bacteria as source (Heo et al. 2017), the bacterial concentrations indoors are higher in dormitories than in classrooms at the same outdoors bacterial level. In addition, the less-straight slopes for the dormitories indicate that the ventilation was insufficient when the windows were closed during cold weather.",

Furthermore, the I/O ratio, defined as Ci/Co, is an important parameter that gives some indication of the primary source of indoor bacteria. In all the selected indoor environments, the indoor bacterial concentration was significantly lower than that outdoors. Resulted from the less students, poor ventilation and mild activity, the I/O ratios for bacteria were far lower than 1.0 for the tested indoor environments, ranging from 0.05 to 0.18, which indicates that the primary sources may have been penetration airflow through gaps around windows or doors, students\u2019 activities, and occupant density. Similar results were obtained by Kim and Kim (2007) and Balasubramanian et al. (2012), who reported that the I/O ratio for bacteria was lower than 1 in various indoor environments. However, the reported I/O values for bacteria are inconsistent with those in other studies by Li et al. (2015) and Mentese et al. (2009), due to higher occupants. Meanwhile, Balasubramanian et al. (2012) found that the I/O ratio was higher than 1 in a bedroom when cleaning activities occurred.

Because the bacterial concentration was measured during daytime hours, students\u2019 exposure to airborne bacteria while sleeping was not studied. Thus, the results regarding the dose of airborne bacteria for university students are limited, and it is difficult to calculate the exact evaluation level for health pollution and to compare the information gained with other research (Madureira et al. 2015) because of the different approaches and sampled micro-environments.",

            "text": "In this study, the bacterial concentrations were measured and analyzed in 12 university classrooms, 12 dormitory rooms, four bathrooms, and a three-story dining hall. As a result, among the three types of indoor environment, the mean bacterial concentration was highest in the dormitories and lowest in classrooms on the ground floor. One possible explanation for this observation may be the higher occupancy and greater activity level of the students in dormitories. The indoor bacterial concentration varied with the outdoor bacterial concentration. The indoor concentration depended strongly on the outdoor concentration, with similar change trends in the classrooms and dormitories, because of natural ventilation. Considering the students\u2019 higher activity level and more numerous material possessions in living spaces, the study demonstrated that these spaces are important environments for exposure to bacteria in indoor air. Students experienced about four times higher dose of airborne bacteria in the dormitories than in the classrooms and dining hall. Because of the unique characteristic of university students, special attention should be paid to the health risks presented by biological pollutants in order to ensure greater efficiency in studying and healthy development for the students.",
