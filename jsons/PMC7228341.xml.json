            "text": "The typical responses of children of different ages to emergencies include fear of future disasters, loss of interest in school, degenerative behaviors, sleep disorders and fear of the dark, and fear of natural phenomena related to disasters. At the same time, children of different ages have different reactions; for example, preschool children often feel helpless and anxious when facing disasters. They often show a loss of previously acquired development skills (regressive behavior), such as thumb sucking, bedwetting, fear of the dark or of animals, sticking to parents, fear of the night, urinary incontinence, constipation, difficulty in speaking (such as stuttering), and loss of appetite. School\u2010age children may repeatedly discuss disaster events or describe themselves as being severely troubled by fear or sadness. Clinically, they show irritability, crying, stickiness, aggressive behavior, competing with siblings for parental attention, fear of the night and dark, nightmares, truancy, and loss of interest in or inability to concentrate on work. In the face of disasters, adolescents often show sleep disorders, loss of appetite, overt rebellious behaviors, and unwillingness to do things, which may become problematic at school. They often exhibit behaviors such as fighting, losing interest, seeking attention, and experience many physical problems, such as headaches, unexplained limb pains, rashes, and problems with excretion, and often lose interest in participating in social activities with peers.",

A psychological crisis refers to a state of psychological imbalance when individuals encounter an emergency or face major setbacks and difficulties, which they can neither avoid nor resolve by using their own resources and coping methods. When an individual encounters a significant problem or change that is difficult to manage and resolve, their mental balance will be broken, normal life will be disturbed, and inner tension will continue to accumulate, leading to feelings of helplessness and even disorders of thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. This state of imbalance is a state of crisis. This crisis arises because the individual realizes that an event or situation exceeds their ability to cope, not because of the event the individual has experienced itself.",

The study of crisis intervention for children is still at the theoretical level, and there is a lack of practical skills for dealing with children in crisis. The processes of child crisis intervention are incomplete and short\u2010term now. Children\u2019s psychological crisis intervention is long\u2010term and heavy\u2010duty, which not only depends on the efforts of psychologists but also requires the joint efforts of parents, teachers, and all members of society. Although the experience of some developed countries can be used for reference, China\u2019s national conditions are different from those of other countries, there is an urgent need to establish a working system for children\u2019s psychological crisis intervention suited to China\u2019s national conditions and characteristics.",

The most crucial step in managing emotions is to be able to identify one\u2019s various emotions and to label each emotion accurately. The more emotions a child can recognize, the more clearly and accurately they can express them. This is the beginning of dealing with emotions. If they can express themselves, they can communicate and think of a way to address the crisis. Sometimes the emotions are resolved when they are expressed.",
