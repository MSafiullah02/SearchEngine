Furthermore, they are involved in many processes, including cell-cycle control, cell metabolism, apoptosis, and gene transcription control [10,14,15,16]. Hence, it is vital to understand the role of 14-3-3 during viral infection. In addition, the structure of 14-3-3 provides its great capability to bind to a multitude of functionally diverse signaling proteins. This property allows 14-3-3 proteins to affect multiple pathways in the host cell and thus become the target of a variety of viruses modulating them to alter cellular processes to their advantage.",

The cup-like structure of 14-3-3 dimers is the key to their diverse functions and target binding properties. Moreover, the rigid structure of the 14-3-3 dimer, and the frequent presence of 14-3-3 binding motifs in a single target molecule and within disordered regions, are the standard features which are essential for 14-3-3 proteins to bind to and regulate their binding partners [18]. The 14-3-3 dimers contain nine \u03b1-helices, which are organized in an anti-parallel array. Among them, helices \u03b1A, \u03b1C and \u03b1D are involved in dimerization; however, helices \u03b1C, \u03b1E, \u03b1G and \u03b1I form a concave amphipathic groove at the ligand-binding site [19,20]. Typically, 14-3-3 proteins bind to phosphorylated serine and threonine residues, with two optimal binding motifs on their targets: RSXpSXP and RXXXpSXP [21]. In some cases, they can also bind to non-phosphorylated targets [21,22].",

In contrast, in-vivo methods include yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) [33] and synthetic lethality techniques [34,35]. For in-silico techniques, usually, computer simulations are used to perform sequence- [36] and structure-based predictions [37], gene fusion [38], and in-silico two-hybrid [39], chromosome proximity [40] and gene expression-based approaches [41,42].",

In general, the host factor contributes positively to the budding of many negative-stranded RNA viruses, as reviewed elsewhere [66,67]. However, in the case of parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5), the M protein interacts with host protein 14-3-3 \u03b2 and negatively affects the production of PIV5 particles [61].

The 14-3-3 proteins interact with the accessory protein Vpr (viral protein R) of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) and significantly regulate cell cycle progression by associating with Cdc25C [62]. Hence, Vpr induces G2-M cell cycle arrest by increasing the association between 14-3-3 \u03b8 and cell cycle regulatory factors (Cdc25C, cyclin B1, and Cdk1) during HIV infection [63].

Interestingly, the Rep78 of AAV-2 does not interact with 14-3-3 proteins. Another key point is that the phosphorylation of Rep68 in the C-terminal seven amino acid (LARGHS) of Rep68 is necessary for the interaction of 14-3-3 with Rep68. Moreover, Yaffe et al. described that 14-3-3 proteins\u2019 interaction with target proteins often entails the phosphorylation of a serine residue [11]. Thus, this observation may provide a hint to understanding the role of Rep68 in AAV infections. Furthermore, 14-3-3-Rep68 interaction down-regulates the DNA binding activity of the target protein in an AAV infection [65]. This suggests that 14-3-3 proteins are functionally involved in the regulation of the Rep68 protein during the viral life cycle.",

Immunity which is 14-3-3-mediated may guide the rational design of therapeutics, and this can be seen in many virus infections [73] as well as mosquito-transmitted Zika and dengue viruses [74,75,76]. In a very recent study, the NS3 protein of the Zika virus interacted with 14-3-3 \u03b5 and 14-3-3 \u03b7 to inhibit RIG-I and the melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) signaling pathway [75]. Notably, 14-3-3 \u03b7 was also reported to promote antiviral signaling by MDA5 in HCV infection [77]. In the dengue virus, 14-3-3 \u03b5 binds to the NS3 protein and prevents RIG-I from translocating to the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein adapter, thereby blocking antiviral signaling [76]. Liu et al. reported 14-3-3 \u03b5 as a critical mediator for the relocation of RIG-I from cytosol to mitochondrial-associated MAVS, as it establishes a translocon complex with RIG-I and TRIM25, eventually triggering an antiviral response [78].",

This binding allows the regulation of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of N protein in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Additionally, our group has shown that N protein induces apoptosis by reducing the expression level of 14-3-3 \u03b8 in the absence of growth factors (serum), which contributes to the accumulation of the phosphorylated N protein in the nucleus [78]. Likewise, coronavirus 2, or COVID-19, originated from China sharing similar demographic profiles, and laboratory and radiological findings with SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [80]. In SARS, our group has demonstrated that N protein is phosphorylated by multiple kinases (cyclin-dependent kinase, glycogen synthase kinase, and casein kinase II) and significantly interferes with cellular machinery by binding to 14-3-3 proteins through phosphorylation-dependent protein\u2013protein interactions. This suggests that this discovery may provide new insights into a possible mechanism for the phosphorylation-dependent nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the N protein and could be a potential antiviral strategy against COVID-19.",

Isoforms of the 14-3-3 family are reported to play essential roles in the life cycle of DNA viruses like the hepatitis B virus (HBV), herpes simplex virus type (HSV-I) and Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) [51,82,83,84]. For instance, in the HBV life cycle, 14-3-3 \u03b6 is responsible for maintaining the HBV protein x (HBx) expression in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCC). The knockdown of 14-3-3 \u03b6 reduces the expression of HBx. This suggests that 14-3-3 \u03b6\u2013HBx interaction could be a potential therapeutic target for HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma [51]. Over the past few years, research has shown that 14-3-3 proteins are key regulators of many processes, including mitosis and apoptosis in animals [85]. According to Kim et al., HBx induces apoptosis by inhibiting the association between 14-3-3 \u03b5 and Bax, thereby enhancing mitochondrial\u2013Bax translocation and cytochrome C release [86]. Consequently, a potential 14-3-3 binding motif of HBx is crucial for stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK)/ Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNK) activitity and Fas-mediated apoptosis protection [87].",

ICP27\u201314-3-3 \u03b8 interaction sequesters Bax to the cytoplasm. Further, ICP27 inhibits the interaction between 14-3-3 \u03b8 and Bax [82]. It is interesting to note that HBV, HCV, and HSV directly associate with, or inhibit, cellular protein 14-3-3 to induce apoptosis (Figure 2). Typically, (pro-apoptotic) Bax is a member of the Bcl-2 family and a key apoptosis regulator. Upon apoptotic stimulation, Bax is activated and oligomerized in the mitochondrial membrane (MOM) to mediate its permeability [88]. Therefore, 14-3-3 proteins are shown to promote Bax-mediated apoptosis, resulting in Bax being activated and MOM permeabilization.",

Interactions between 14-3-3 and BPLF1 may participate in the regulation of many signaling pathways; ubiquitin ligases, cullin 1 (CUL1) and tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25) are the possible partners in this regulation. Furthermore, 14-3-3 proteins and TRIM25 serve as vital co-factors in the signaling of viral nucleic acid sensors, such as retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and MDA5 [78].
