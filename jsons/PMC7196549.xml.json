Face masks, for example, were unavailable for many weeks and have fueled a disreputable black market. Moreover, there were no exact provisions for physicians who were following patients at home. In Palermo, a metropolitan city of Southern Italy, in March the requests of home care assistance doubled compared to the same period of the previous year, putting stressed teams accustomed to following fewer patients. This was due to a reduced possibility of hospitalization and the shortage of beds for patients with cancer or non-cancer chronic diseases. Ironically, some patients refused the visits for fear of contagion (3).",

The government issued increasingly stringent decrees to limit the conduct of daily life with the aim of preventing contagion. Irrespective of the obligations for health personnel, serious restrictions have also been introduced for relatives, with limitations or prohibitions on visits. They too were forced to use personal protective equipment. All this caused a surreal atmosphere for palliative care in which the presence of a family member next to the patient is essential. Patients remain alone all the day without support, except that provided by the health workers. It is well known that family support in a Mediterranean country is of paramount importance. In response some patients can ask to be discharged earlier than necessary. Sadly, some others die without any final contact with relatives or say good-bye before being admitted to hospice.",

Indeed, some hospices stopped their activities. To partially overcome these issues we have been adopted \u201cWhatsApp\u201d to get family members to participate in clinical rounds (4). The family members were called live from the patient's telephone number during the doctors' visit to exchange information on the clinical progress and share the choices to be made.",

The family members of patients who were unable to communicate were excluded. A voluntary interview was performed by phone, about the use of this remote technology, just after the WhatsApp session. Four formal questions were posed: 1) Are you happy to virtually attend the clinical round? 2) Are you happy with the information gained in this occasion? 3) Do you think that your loved one was happy to see you during the clinical rounds? 4) This technology may substitute your presence during the clinical rounds? The scores were 0 = no, 1= a little bit, 2=much, 3=very much. Relatives were free to comment about these points.",

One patient did not agree with the relatives\u2019 interview. In such cases information was given by telephone. Thus, sixteen family members were interviewed. Seven patients did not have a smart telephone or an e-Paid. In these cases, a smart phone was offered by the team. The characteristics of patients and family members who agreed with the interview and scores regarding the questionnaire are reported in Table 1\n. Most family members were happy to virtually attend the visit: \u201cI was happy to see him and you while talking about the treatment\u201d; \u201cIt was a pleasure to note the smart atmosphere surrounding my loved one you created \u201c; \u201cI was happy to be updated on the results of the investigations and treatment you proposed, explaining the reasons for such decisions\u201d; \u201cI liked to share your information about the treatments and the next follow-up, albeit at a distance\u201d. \u201cI was happily surprised by this initiative\u201d. However, most of relatives also added: \u201cI recognize the actual situation is regulated by law, but no technology can provide the same effects experienced by my presence\u201d or \u201cIt could be the last time I see him/her\u201d. Thus, some of the problems related to government restrictions, could be overcome with simple technology available to most population, proposing a temporary, hopefully, communication model of adaptation to this crisis. However, as expected, this modality of communication cannot substitute the real presence bedside and should considered as a temporary measure. While patients admitted to the acute palliative care unit in the majority of cases will be discharged home, hospice patients have a high mortality rate. In fact, in Italy the mean admission time in hospice is less than three weeks, and 86% of patients will die in hospice (5). It is sad to say that patients who are admitted to hospice will say good-bye before dying.",
