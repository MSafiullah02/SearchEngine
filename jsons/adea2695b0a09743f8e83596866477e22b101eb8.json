This chapter shifts the focus from the relationship between individual health rights and state requirements, notably immunization, and responsibilities, particularly in providing security against health threats, to international requirements and responsibilities for health. Through the lens of the SARS and the H5N1, it traces the newest evolution of the International Health Regulations (IHRs). It analyses the positions and compromises of states, notably with regard to their sovereignty, in reaching the final compromise: to share responsibility in safeguarding global health. It takes to task the regulations' lack of 'teeth': the fact that despite international treaty status, the IHRs operate on a voluntary basis without an enforcement mechanism.",

Both are airborne, making them potentially more dangerous than either HIV and AIDS or Ebola Virus Disease (EVD, see above). Yet arguably because neither is especially efficient in its human-to-human transmission, clusters of cases of each are often referred to as outbreaks as opposed to epidemics or pandemics. However, these clusters do appear within countries, causing epidemics; each epidemic of infectious disease then has the ability to spread globally to become a pandemic. Both H5N1 and SARS emerged in localized outbreaks and quickly spread to become epidemics and pandemics. The emerging pattern is increasingly familiar. WHERE TO H5N1 AND SARS COME FROM?

This omission reflected the fractured relationship between the Chinese government, which insisted that the SARS outbreak was under control and refused to report new cases promptly to the WHO. 44 Its recalcitrance, and the negative international reception and reputation that it resulted in for China, would later prove an important lesson and impetus in support of the adoption of the revised and updated International Health Regulations (IHRs). While demanding especially prompt reporting-within 24 hours-compliance with the new IHRs, these included, as a reward, leniency on sanctions such as travel advisories and travel warnings. As the latter send signals that can influence the continuation or the cessation of tourism and investment, they can be a powerful tool in prompting compliance. Otherwise, however, the IHRs lack real enforcement mechanisms beyond \"naming and shaming,\" as per China and its initial response to SARS. ",

This means that hospital staff and community members should wear surgical masks and take special precautions to maintain hand hygiene. It also means that they need to take particular precautions when removing gear (mask and gloves and medical equipment). Furthermore, effective containment of any viral outbreak includes the treatment of patients in isolation (wards), and (home) quarantine. 47 Before any of this can occur, however, the presence of, in this case, H5N1 or SARS has to be identified and response measures initiated. Initiation in turn requires anticipation, identification and implementation of a plan to respond. \"Planning for epidemics, animal or human, is to a large extent based on what a disease did the last time. It is much more difficult to predict what a disease will do next.\" 48 The WHO recommends, as it cannot require, nor can it enforce its recommendations, that states nominate national laboratories designated to perform tests which can isolate and identify the infectious agent in question. These tests use virus-and antibody-rich serum obtained from suspected patients to confirm, via PCR, 49 ELISA, 50 or IFA 51 tests, or through virus isolation, the presence of the virus. Such tests are complex and expensive, take time, and are not always available at the local or community level. Resourced laboratories are meant to exist in every country. In reality, many states lack such facilities. Furthermore, the role of the WHO was, and is, largely to coordinate the international response to a disease outbreak. It is not an implementing agency as such. Ideally, it would anticipate and coordinate a response before a full-blown disease outbreak occurs. Towards that end, the WHO, together with 47 49 See first reference to PCR, Chapter 3. 50 See Biochemische Grundlagen, Chapter 3. 51 Immunofluorescence assay.",

Informed by studies such as one done in July 2015, which estimated that the flu cost the United States US$2.6 billion in lost sales, almost US$400 million in forgone taxes and 15,693 jobs, the calculations recall the dire predictions and real cost consequences with regard to the impacts of HIV and AIDS and Ebola. Economics plays a key role in mobilizing a response to these bird-borne diseases. 68 As devastating as the losses were to Iowa, Minnesota and other states, their 50 million turkeys and hens represented a small portion of the poultry industry. The largest concentrations of chickens in the United States-Georgia, which raises 1.3 billion broilers a year, and the Delmarva Peninsula, where the broiler business began in the 1920s-lie under another migration route that ducks take over the Americas. If the flu were to land in those areas and spread the way it did in the Midwest, much of the US poultry industry would be in jeopardy: almost nine billion birds, 90 billion eggs, more than US$40 billion in earnings, 1.3 million jobs. As Roth notes, \"there was almost no federal money invested in biosecurity for livestock. Basically, it is the responsibility of the producer.\" 69 IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS H5N1 and SARS pose a particular epidemic and pandemic health threat because their transmission is airborne (SARS) or has the potential to become so (H5N1). In addition, since those infected are in the main previously healthy adults, initially inconclusive symptoms do not necessarily ring alarm bells until the virus(es) have spread significantly.",

The symptoms of many upper-and lower-respiratory tract illnesses are similar. This makes laboratory tests vital. Such tests are complex and expensive, take time, and are not always available at the local or community level. Indeed, the WHO recommends that states identify national laboratories designated to perform such tests: such laboratories are meant to exist in every country. In reality, many lack such facilities. Hence it is all the more important that the local and national levels of response be linked to the international level. This is especially true when and where epidemics or pandemics have the potential to emerge. H5N1, and SARS, present just such a threat. Yet clusters identified by GOARN (see also above), or in Germany, through the Robert-Koch-Institute (RKI) can flag emerging outbreaks and prompt informative, proactive, and failing, that, reactive, responses.",

January 23, 2003: The Executive Board (EB) of the World Health Organization in EB111.R6 18 urges the adoption of a resolution on the prevention and control of influenza pandemics and annual epidemics. January 24, 2003: The Executive Board of the WHO, in EB111.R13, 19 supports the adoption of a resolution to revise the International Health Regulations (IHRs) to take into account new and emerging infectious disease agents as well as their potential use as weapons of terrorism. 2003-2004: Outbreak via domestic ducks, who, it turns out, served as a crucial reservoir for the virus, which was by then a recombinant virus composed of many viruses linked to the \"original\" goose virus. The 2003-2004 outbreak made clear that H5N1 came about through an animal-to-human viral transmission: \"the increasing spread of the viruses from existing reservoirs of infection in domestic waterfowl and live bird markets leading to greater environmental contamination.\" 20 Since 2003, HPAI H5N1 has been detected in poultry and wild birds in more than 50 countries, spanning Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East. 212003: The first HPAI H5N1 cases were confirmed in Europe. 22 17 See WHA54.14 Agenda item 13.3, \"Global Health Security: Epidemic Alert and Response,\" (May 21, 2001) available at: http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/ documents/s16356e/s16356e.pdf. 18 See WHO EB111.R6 Agenda item 5.8, \"Prevention and Control of Influenza Pandemics and Annual Epidemics,\" (January 23, 2003) available at: http://apps. who.int/gb/archive/pdf_files/EB111/eeb111r6.pdf. 19 WHO EB111.R13 Agenda item 5.12, \"Revision of the International Health Regulations,\" (January 24, 2003) available at: http://apps.who.int/gb/archive/ pdf_files/EB111/eeb111r13.pdf. 20 Sims et al.
