Instead of a single solution, a level set offers a range of solutions each meeting the goal and thus provides useful knowledge in tolerance for industrial product design. The proposed warping scheme increases performance of existing level set estimation algorithmsin particular the ambiguity acquisition function. This is done by constructing a complex covariance function to warp the Gaussian Process. The covariance function is designed to expand regions deemed to have a high potential for being at the desired level whilst contracting others. Subsequently, Bayesian optimisation using this covariance function ensures that the level set is sampled more thoroughly. Experimental results demonstrate increased efficiency of level set discovery using the warping scheme. Theoretical analysis concerning warping the covariance function, maximum information gain and bounds on the cumulative regret are provided.",

            "text": "Level set estimation is a common problem in industrial design where, instead of a single best design, it is useful to find a set of designs that meet a target. This can then be used for robust manufacturing or to further screen on subsidiary objectives. Consider designing the structure of a vehicle to achieve target crash-safety performance. Vehicle regulations require that the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) not exceed 700 under standard test conditions [6] , with lower values indicating better protection against brain injury. The design process often involves first generating a set of designs that meet the criteria via a crash simulator [9] and then filtering for cost before selecting one for actual ground testing. Generating the set of designs (or a representative set, in the case of continuous variables) can be posed as a level set estimation problem. Coupled with the fact that such simulators are computationally expensive, it is important that level sets are found in the minimum number of trials. Similarly, in alloy design, it is useful to find the set of elemental composition that produce alloys with similar mechanical properties. Such a set can then be used for robust specification of the alloy composition. Similar examples are abound in other domains [7] . Hence, level set estimation is an important problem.",

The search for the next point is guided by the optimisation of a surrogate model, known as an acquisition function. There are two major limitations in the current work on BO for level set estimation: 1) they considered only discrete sets to demonstrate convergence of the algorithm, and 2) they end up being more explorative i.e. samples are more scattered as they do not use the fact that most of the level sets for a continuous function tend to be contiguous. The first limitation restricts its application and the second provides an avenue to further improve the sample efficiency, particularly under a budget constraint. Hence, scope for a level set estimation algorithm for expensive black-box functions that works with continuous variables and exploits the continuity of the functions for improved efficiency is still open.",

We implement the warped GP through a non-stationary covariance function such that regions with high potential to be on the level are expanded, whilst others are contracted. The potential is computed by a monotonic function of the difference of the mean prediction from the intended level, scaled by the predicted variance (both the predictions are obtained from an intermediate GP with stationary kernel). The difference from mean term encourages areas close by to existing samples from the level set to have high potential (using continuity of the GP), whilst the variance scaling guards against any undue optimism. When compared against the usual stationary kernel, it tends to operate in a more exploitative manner. Under a budget constraint, exploitative sampling is more beneficial as once one point at the level is discovered, sampling close by is likely to reveal more points on that level. In contrast an explorative algorithm may find little or no points on the level before the budget expires. Theoretical analysis of our proposed warped kernel based approach shows the proposed algorithm is able to retain the sublinear growth rate of the cumulative regret and extensive experiments with both synthetic and real-world functions (including on alloy and car design) demonstrate a significant increase in sample efficiency.",

In LSE, the ambiguity acquisition function is adapted from the Straddle heuristic [4] , providing a balance between exploration and exploitation. This algorithm is an online method that utilises confidence intervals to classify points as being either above or below the level. Similar in nature to LSE in its classification, the TruVar algorithm provides functionality for both Level set estimation and BO applications, utilising the common GP based approach to unite the methods. For Level set estimation applications, the algorithm uses lookahead to select the next sample point as one which provides the greatest reduction in the sum of truncated variances within a set of unclassified points. This method further incorporates point-wise costs and heteroscedastic noise into its selection. In the application of this method in both [8] and [2] , the authors have utilised a monotonically decreasing set for unclassified points, based on the bounds of the GP. This method of classification however is suited when sampling is done on a discrete domain.",

We will make the current process [8] faster by exploiting the contiguous nature of level sets. This is by defining a warping kernel function that expands regions where the level has a higher chance of existing, while contracting regions where the chance is low. This is done by first computing a GP without warping, also referred to as the original GP (GP o ), and using its predictive mean, \u03bc t (x) and variance \u03c3 2 t (x) to construct the warped kernel used to compute the warped GP (GP w ). GP w is then used for computing the warped acquisition function. GP w ensures regions around an observation already at the level is endowed with smaller length-scales than other regions, resulting in higher acquisition function values, thus translating to a higher chance of selecting the next sample from that region. We describe the warping kernel and then analyse its properties. We then provide the warped acquisition function, followed by convergence analysis. We note it is useful to build a better understanding of the level set rather than outputting a small set of sampled points that exist at the level. For such situations we output a GP model based on the samples. As most samples tend to come from near the level, we believe that the level set produced by this GP would be more accurate than when samples come from other means e.g. existing level set estimation methods. This performance can be tested by classifying other points in the region (that are not on the level) into a super-level and sub-level set.",

Using a simplified car crash simulation, we demonstrate an important application of level set estimation for the design of safe vehicles. The problem focuses on a vehicle moving at a constant velocity and crashing into a pole, resulting in the front of the car deforming. A car must be designed to maintain the safety of passengers. In both experiments below, the input parameters represent the mass of various car components. Altering these inputs alters the rigidity of the car. If too rigid, the passengers will experience injury from the forces of impact (eg. whiplash). If not rigid enough, the front of the car may crush and intrude into the passenger space. The objective of such a problem is to maximise the \"crashworthiness\" of the vehicle. Experiment 1. In the first crash experiment there are two design parameters: mass of the front bumper bar tbumper and, mass of the front, hood and underside of the bonnet thood. Both range between 1 and 5, representing the thickness of the component. To construct the dataset, each of the two input parameters were sampled within the entire range in steps of 0.1, resulting in 1681 combinations. The output of the simulation is a Head injury criterion (HIC) with the objective being to maintain HIC < 250.",

The warping metric valued the same characteristics as the acquisition function, allowing the two to operate together. The warping metric however results in the acquisition function behaving more exploitatively, which is beneficial in level set estimation problems. Guarantees of convergence were presented as well as bounds on the length scale range and maximum information gain.",

Proof of Theorem 3 is provided in supplementary material. Note in Theorem 3, regret bounds are of order O(T ) only when the function does not have a level at h i.e. either h > f max or h < f min .
