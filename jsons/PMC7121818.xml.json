This is indeed the case for most double-stranded DNA and RNA viruses for which the genome sequence has been reported (Gorbalenya et al. 1988a,b; Gorbalenya and Koonin 1989). Many positive-strand RNA viruses too encode their own helicases presumably to remove any partial duplexes that might exist within the genome and to facilitate viral replication either directly or indirectly (Jeang and Yedavalli 2006). Some viruses have been identified to encode for more than one helicase indicating the role of helicases in other viral processes like packaging (Kadare and Haenni 1997; Luking et al. 1998). Table 20.1 gives a comprehensive list of viral genuses with their corresponding hosts.

This, however, is not a very stringent classification as many of the DNA helicases can unwind RNA and vice versa (Matson and Kaiser-Rogers 1990; Kadare and Haenni 1997; Luking et al. 1998). Helicases are also classified based on the polarity of their translocation as 3\u02b9\u21925\u02b9 helicases or 5\u02b9\u21923\u02b9 helicases. A 3\u02b9\u21925\u02b9 helicase requires a 3\u02b9single-stranded tail to load onto the nucleic-acid substrate and move unidirectionally toward the 5\u02b9 end of the substrate. Some examples of 3\u02b9\u21925\u02b9 helicase are HCV NS3 (Gwack et al. 1996), E. coli UvrD (Matson 1986), the RNA helicase from Vaccinia virus NPH-II (Shuman 1993), etc. A 5\u02b9\u21923\u02b9 helicase requires a 5\u02b9 single-stranded tail for it to load and move along the nucleic acid. Some examples of 5\u02b9\u21923\u02b9 helicases are T7 gp4 helicase\u2013primase (Matson et al. 1983), E. coli DnaB (LeBowitz and McMacken 1986), phage T4 Dda helicase (Jongeneel et al. 1984), etc. Though most helicases require a single-stranded tail to initiate unwinding, some enzymes like E. coli RecBCD can initiate the strand-separation reaction from a blunt-ended duplex (Braedt and Smith 1989).",

            "text": "The largest classification of helicases is based on their primary structure. The earliest classification of helicases by Gorbalenya and Koonin, based on amino acid sequence similarities revealed several conserved sequence motifs. Based on the extent of sequence similarity, they classified helicases into three large superfamilies: SF1, SF2, and SF3 (SF standing for superfamily) and smaller families (Fig. 20.1) (Gorbalenya and Koonin 1993). SF1 and SF2 constitute the largest of these superfamilies. The proteins of these superfamilies shared seven conserved motifs (Fig. 20.2). Two of these motifs, designated as the Walker A and the Walker B motifs are conserved among all the helicases and other nucleotide hydrolases as they are implicated in NTP binding and hydrolysis (Gorbalenya et al. 1988a,b). The SF3 superfamily of helicases contained only three conserved motifs including the Walker A and Walker B sequences (Fig. 20.2). This superfamily includes the majority of viral helicases (Gorbalenya et al. 1990). Of the two smaller families, one contained helicases related to the E. coli DnaB helicase. These proteins shared three distinct conserved motifs in addition to Walker A and Walker B sequences (Fig. 20.2). Only bacterial and bacteriophage members of this family have been identified so far and all the (putative) helicases have been shown to have a functional and/or physical association with a primase function as well (Ilyina et al. 1992). The last group of proteins showed extensive sequence similarity to the transcription terminator Rho. This group also included the AAA+ family of ATPases, demonstrating an apparent evolutionary relationship between helicases and non-helicase NTPases (Iyer et al. 2004).",

Novel protein motifs have been discovered which are conserved among helicases across different species. This called for a revision in the classification of the helicase superfamilies. In the current system of classification suggested by Singleton et al., the helicases are classified into six superfamilies SF1 through SF6. SF1 and SF2 still remain the largest of the superfamilies; SF3 continues to constitute the viral helicases. The DnaB-like family has been renamed as superfamily 4 (SF4), Rho family as SF5. The AAA+ ATPases are now classified into a stand-alone superfamily of their own in SF6 (Singleton et al. 2007). The conserved sequence motifs among SF1 and SF2 family members have been extended to include the TxGx motif (Pause and Sonenberg 1992), Q-motif (Tanner et al. 2003), motif-4a (Korolev et al. 1998), and TRG motif (Mahdi et al. 2003), some of which are specific to each superfamily or subfamilies therein(Singleton et al. 2007). Singleton et al. also propose to include the directionality of translocation as criterion for classifying the members of the superfamily into subfamilies. In their classification, subfamily A represents 3\u02b9\u2192 5\u02b9 helicases within the superfamily, while subfamily B represents 5\u02b9\u21923\u02b9 helicases (Singleton et al. 2007).",

The conserved lysine residue in both the families is responsible for binding to the \u03b2- and \u03b3-phosphates of NTP\u2013Mg complex. Mutation of this lysine residue results in deficiency of the ATPase activity (Hall and Matson 1999). However, it has no effect on nucleic-acid binding (Levin and Patel 2002). Motif Ia of both superfamilies is involved in ssDNA binding (Kim et al. 1998; Lee and Yang 2006). In a recent study on HSV-1 UL9 helicase, mutational analysis of the residues in the Ia motif implicated in DNA binding resulted in moderate to severe defects in single-stranded nucleic-acids binding and ssNA stimulated ATPase activity, while retaining the intrinsic ATPase activity similar to that of wildtype enzyme (Marintcheva and Weller 2003). Motif II has a conserved sequence of XXDEXD/H and is referred to as the Walker B motif (Linder et al. 1989). Proteins carrying a conserved D-E-A-D sequence, also referred to as the DEAD-box proteins, are predominantly RNA helicases (Koonin 1991; Koonin 1992; Linder and Daugeron 2000; Cordin et al. 2006), while proteins carrying variant of the DEAD sequence like DEAH/DEXH are usually DNA helicases (Subramanya et al. 1996; Linder 2000; Linder and Daugeron 2000). The conserved D of this motif has been shown to interact with the catalytic Mg2+ and is important for the NTPase activity. A mutation in this residue affects both the NTPase and the helicase function (Pause and Sonenberg 1992).",

An invariant arginine in this domain has been shown to be extremely important for the RNA helicase activity of HCV NS3 helicase (Kim et al. 1997). In SF1 helicases, residues in motif III are also involved in nucleic-acid binding through hydrogen-bonding and stacking interactions with the nucleic-acid bases (Hall and Matson 1999). Motifs I, IV, and V of the SF1 helicases have been shown to have direct contact with either the nucleotide in the enzyme-NTP complexes or interact with the nucleic acid through the sugar\u2013phosphate backbone (Korolev et al. 1997; Hall and Matson 1999; Velankar et al. 1999). In the SF2 family, a newly discovered motif, called the Q-motif, owing to its conserved Gln residue has been implicated in adenine recognition of these enzymes (Tanner 2003; Tanner et al. 2003; Tuteja and Tuteja 2004; Killoran and Keck 2006).",

The Walker B motif is atypical and carries a consensus of XXXXEE, while the motif C carries the consensus XXX(S/T)(S/T)N (Hall and Matson 1999; James et al. 2003). The motif C of SF3 helicases is implicated in distinguishing ATP from ADP. The conserved Asn hydrogen bonds to the \u03b3-phosphate of ATP to facilitate this function (James et al. 2003). B\u02b9 motif is characterized by a 14-residue long stretch, with a central highly conserved glycine, and positively charged residues on either end of the motif. This motif has been established to be involved in nucleotide binding and unwinding. Mutation of a Lys at one end of the motif abolishes both helicase and ATPase activity, while the mutation of the other Lys eliminates helicase but not ATPase activity (Walker et al. 1997).",

Two of the five are the Walker A and Walker B motifs common to all helicases and NTPases, while the other three are specific to this helicase family. Bacteriophage T7 helicase, the viral representative of this family, has been extensively studied, not only in terms of its structure but also biochemically and mechanistically (Matson et al. 1983; Rosenberg et al. 1992; Hingorani and Patel 1993; Patel and Hingorani 1993; Patel et al. 1994; Egelman et al. 1995; Patel and Hingorani 1995; Hingorani and Patel 1996; Washington et al. 1996; Yu et al. 1996; Ahnert and Patel 1997; Hingorani et al. 1997; Picha and Patel 1998; Sawaya et al. 1999; Ahnert et al. 2000; Patel and Picha 2000; Singleton et al. 2000; Kim et al. 2002; Toth et al. 2003; Jeong et al. 2004). From the crystal structure studies, four of the five conserved domains, 1,1a, 2, and 3 lie in the conserved C-terminal domain of the helicase and are involved in nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. Domain 4 is a part of the DNA-binding surface of the helicase and lines the region which forms the central channel when the hexamer gets assembled (Sawaya et al. 1999; Singleton et al. 2000; Toth et al. 2003).",

This observation is exemplified by the eukaryotic transcription initiation factor eIF4a, an SF2 DEAD-box helicase (Rogers et al. 2002). eIF4a protein, which is essentially just the RecA-like motor with no additional domains, is a very poor helicase (Du et al. 2002).

However, the disparities between the helicases in terms of their polarity, substrate specificity, oligomeric nature, etc., could be derived from the associated domains and/or proteins. Thus, it is often necessary to study these proteins as a part of the macromolecular complex in which they form the central functional component, rather than in isolation. This is especially true of viral helicases, where the helicase not only plays a central role in genome replication but also in other functions like mRNA capping, recombination, packaging, etc.",

            "text": "In viruses, the minimal replisome consists of a helicase, polymerase, and a single-strand binding protein (SSB). The virus hijacks the host machinery for all other accessory proteins. However, the virus-specific activities lie within the minimal replisome. Thus, many of the virus-encoded proteins are known to be multi-domain with multiple functions. Figure 20.4 gives a few examples of the accessory activities associated with some viral helicases along with their role in viral replication. In addition to the multiple functions that many viral helicase possess, they act in concert with many other proteins to carry out functions that aid viral replications. In some viruses, this kind of multi-protein interactions is required for facilitating basic functions that might reside within a single polypeptide in other viruses. For example, in herpes-simplex virus type-1, the association of three proteins, UL8, UL5, and UL52, constitutes the helicase\u2013primase activity (Crute et al. 1991). Similarly, in papillomaviruses, the E1 protein has to associate with the E2 protein for origin binding and initiation of replication (Seo et al. 1993; Masterson et al. 1998; Gillitzer et al. 2000). Helicases also interact functionally and physically with the polymerases within the replication complex. These polymerases could be either host-derived or virus derived (Smale and Tjian 1986; Gannon and Lane 1990; Park et al. 1994; Notarnicola et al. 1997; Delagoutte and von Hippel 2001; Kato et al. 2001; Piccininni et al. 2002). These interactions could be either direct protein\u2013protein interactions or mediated through an intermediary scaffolding protein. Single-strand binding proteins have also shown to interact with the helicases both in vitro and in vivo. The SSB could once again be host-derived or virus derived (For examples see: (Nakai and Richardson 1988; Hamatake et al. 1997; Kong and Richardson 1998; Lefebvre et al. 1999).",

They have evolved to have some of the smallest genomes, encoding for only those functions that are most essential and are specific to its replication. Thus from the point of view of viral evolution and host-virus specificity, hijacking host proteins for viral replication maximizes the viral perpetuation by re-routing all or most of the cellular metabolism towards virus-directed processes. Protein\u2013protein interactions between helicases and other accessory proteins also have kinetic and thermodynamic implications. The function of most helicases within such assemblies is not merely to catalyze the opening of a dsNA segment, but also to drive rearrangements in which one or both of the ssNA products end up bound to another macromolecular component. Often the inclusion of loading or trapping factors can improve helicase activity. A loading factor facilitates initiation of the helicase reaction, while a trapping component (e.g., ssNA binding protein) facilitates elongation by stabilizing ssNA intermediates in the reaction as they are formed. In the context of replication, the ssNA thus stabilized can be used by the polymerase for genome replication. Thus, a simplified replisome can be thought to be a combination of at least two motor proteins: the helicase and the polymerase.",

The polarity of the single-strand almost always depends on the polarity of the helicase translocation, i.e., a 3\u02b9\u21925\u02b9 helicase uses a short single-stranded 3\u02b9-tail, while a 5\u02b9\u21923\u02b9 helicase uses a 5\u02b9-tail. Many of the ring-helicases like T7 gene4 helicase, DnaB helicase of E. coli, etc., require a Y-shaped substrate, having both 3\u02b9 and 5\u02b9-tails. Interestingly, SF3 helicases like E1 helicase of Papillomaviruses and T-antigen from SV40 can initiate unwinding from completely dsDNA by binding to a site-specific region (origin of replication), causing duplex melting and entry of the helicase onto the single-stranded region. The site-specific DNA binding is mediated by the DNA-binding domain, while the unwinding is mediated by the ATPase/helicase domain (Wu et al. 1998; Wu et al. 2001; Enemark and Joshua-Tor 2006).",

A direct evidence for this was shown with Rep helicase binding to single-stranded dT16 containing the fluorescent base Etheno-adenosine at the 5\u02b9 end or the 3\u02b9 end. The enzyme showed different extents of fluorescence enhancements depending on position of the label (Bjornson et al. 1998). A similar observation was also demonstrated with HCV NS3 helicase domain using duplex substrates with either a 5\u02b9- or a 3\u02b9-overhang. The enzyme bound to the 3\u02b9-overhang with a 45-fold higher affinity than to the 5\u02b9-overhang (Levin et al. 2005). Another parameter that can be obtained from nucleic-acid binding experiments is the occlusion site measurement. Occlusion site can be defined as the number of bases/base pairs the enzyme protects when it binds to the nucleic-acid substrate. Nuclease foot-printing is often used to assay for the occlusion site. Occlusion site measurements also give an idea about the enzyme\u2019s interaction with the duplex region or the displaced strand.\n\n",

            "text": "It is extremely interesting to note that the enzyme\u2019s DNA-binding behavior is vastly different from its RNA-binding behavior. It has been shown that NS3h helicase binds ssRNA with a 10-fold lower affinity, at neutral pH, than it binds DNA (Levin and Patel 2002). However, the enzyme seems to have maximal RNA-binding capacity at pH 6.5 (Gwack et al. 1996). Also, the affinity of the ATP bound enzyme for RNA is increased at low pH (Lam et al. 2004). Though NS3 helicase possesses the ability to bind to any single-stranded RNA, it exhibits a preference for its genomic RNA sequences. Banerjee and Dasgupta have shown that NS3 binds to the 3\u02b9-UTR of the genomic RNA with a much higher affinity than the 5\u02b9-UTR sequence (Banerjee and Dasgupta 2001). They attribute the differential affinities to the secondary structures associated with each of these sequences (Banerjee and Dasgupta 2001). The specificity of the HCV helicase for the 3\u02b9-UTR could implicate a role for the helicase in viral replication since the negative strand synthesis would have to initiate at this terminus. Chang et al have demonstrated that the Arginine-rich motif (motif VI) of SF2 helicases is important for RNA binding (Chang et al. 2000). This motif is both structurally and functionally conserved in many flaviviruses including the HGV (Gwack et al. 1999). The conserved Arginine is critical for nucleic-acid binding and helicase activity. The dynamics of the subdomain 2, which contains this conserved motif, revealed that this domain could be responsible for the conformational change associated with ATP-binding and hydrolysis, thereby driving the helicase reaction (Liu et al. 2001). The subdomain 2 has also been implicated in dsDNA binding. Motifs IV and V of subdomain 2 have been shown to undergo local unfolding in order to accommodate the dsDNA in their DNA-binding site (Liu et al. 2003).",

One of the earliest approaches was to study the steady-state kinetics of NTP hydrolysis as a function of ssDNA length (Liu and Alberts 1981; Matson and Richardson 1983; Raney and Benkovic 1995). The steady-state kinetics of NTP hydrolysis has also been used to differentiate between the ssDNA translocation activities of PriA protein from its unwinding activity (Lee and Marians 1990). A more recent approach involves biotin labeling the oligonucleotide at either the 3\u02b9- or the 5\u02b9-end and observing the disruption of the biotin\u2013streptavidin complex by the helicase (Morris et al. 2001). This approach has been used to demonstrate both the polarity and the unidirectional translocation of bacteriophage T4 Dda helicase (Byrd and Raney 2004) HCV NS3 helicase and SV40 T-antigen (Morris et al. 2002). Kim and co-workers not only studied pre-steady state kinetics of dTTP hydrolysis as a function of ssDNA length, of bacteriophage T7 helicase, but also studied the energy coupling of the process using a coupled enzyme assay which measured the amount of inorganic phosphate (Pi) released using phosphate-binding protein (PBP) labeled with MDCC (Kim et al. 2002). This approach originally developed by the Webb lab (Hirshberg et al. 1998) has been used to obtain stepping rates and energy efficiency (coupling constants) of other enzymes including PcrA, UvrD (Raney and Benkovic 1995; Dillingham et al. 1999; Dillingham et al. 2000; Soultanas and Wigley 2000). Extensive modeling of the pre-steady state kinetics of NTP-dependent translocation of the motor proteins have been done by Fischer and Lohman (Fischer and Lohman 2004) and demonstrated on the E. coli protein UvrD (Fischer et al. 2004; Tomko et al. 2007).\n\n",

In the \u201cinchworm\u201d type stepping model (Fig. 20.6a), one site is bound to the nucleic acid tightly (H), while the other site is weakly bound (T). NTP hydrolysis results in a power stroke, causing the weak site T to dissociate, move away from the tight site H and bind ahead of it. At the new position, the weak site T initiates tight interactions and becomes the new H site, in the process weakening the interactions of the previous H site to generate the new T site. In another power stroke, the sites undergo another round of nucleic-acid affinity changes to obtain their original starting affinities. Thus, one cycle in an inchworm stepping mechanism is completed with six conformational changes (Hill and Tsuchiya 1981; Lohman 1993; Patel and Donmez 2006).",

In this mechanism, three cooperative steps of sequential DNA-binding and release are required for processive translocation along ssDNA. DNA is translocated by power strokes powered by NTP binding to the catalytic site. First, the empty NTP site gets occupied to generate the weak DNA-binding site T*. The DNA-binding step in the next subunit, T*\u2192N\u00b7T*, commences when the previous subunit in the sequence has completed its power stroke and is in the N\u00b7T state. Geometrically, this is possible if the power stroke of the previous subunit brings the DNA strand into a position where it can quickly fluctuate to the next subunit. Since hydrolysis enables release of the DNA strand, in order to ensure high processivity the unbinding of DNA in one subunit must take place after the binding of DNA to the next subunit. Thus, the transition N\u00b7T\u2192DP in one catalytic site must follow the binding of nucleotide to the next site, i.e., state T*\u2192N\u00b7T*. Finally, the power stroke N.T*\u2192N\u00b7T, results in translocation (Liao et al. 2005).",

Now the enzyme waits for the two strands to open due to thermal fraying. Once a base pair opens, the enzyme now moves ahead and this cycle continues till the duplex has completely separated. For a passive helicase, the unwinding step-size is likely to be one, since it is extremely difficult for more than one base pair to open by thermal fluctuations. In the \u201cactive\u201d mechanism of helicase action (Fig. 20.7b), the enzyme destabilizes the junction, thereby altering the energy profile of the duplexes at the junction, making them easier to melt. An active mechanism can account for larger step-sizes reported for many of the helicases (Serebrov and Pyle 2004; Spurling et al. 2006; Myong et al. 2007). Force dependence and stability dependence studies have revealed that both T7 gene 4 helicase and the HCV NS3 helicase unwind by an active mechanism (Cheng et al. 2007; Donmez et al. 2007; Johnson et al. 2007).\n\n",

However, this mechanism has now been refined. According to the new model, the separated strands no longer loop out of the double hexamer, but instead an alternative conformation is proposed where the ssDNA exit through an exit channel on the helicase domain of the double helical enzyme (Gai et al. 2004). A few other mechanisms have been used to describe strand separation by hexameric helicases and these include, the torsional model, plough-share model, etc. (Takahashi et al. 2005; Patel and Donmez 2006).\n\n",

X-ray structures often reveal important information about substrate binding and/or catalysis. In panel (a) is the E1 helicase of Papilloma virus in complex with ssDNA and ADP (PDB ID: 2GXA). In E1 helicase, the ssDNA is bound in the central channel of hexameric helicase and the ADP is co-ordinated at the interface between the subunits. Panel (b) is the structure of the bi-functional primase\u2013helicase, also a hexameric helicase, from bacteriophage T7 (PDB ID:1Q57). In this protein, the primase domain trails behind the helicase domain, giving a distinct two domain organization of the protein. It should also be noted that the primase domain of one subunit interacts with the helicase domain of the neighbouring subunit. Panel (c) is the X-ray structure of helicase domain of the Hepatitis C virus NS3 helicase co-crystallized with ssDNA (PDB ID:1A1V). Unlike E1 and T7 gene4 helicases, NS3 is a monomeric helicase. It binds to the ssDNA in the cleft between all its subdomains. Panel (d) is the crystal structure of the full length NS3 protease-helicase (PDB ID: 1C1U). The protein is a recombinant construct where the 4A peptide, the co-factor for the protease domain (Howe et al. 1999), has been covalently attached to the N-terminus of the protease domain of the full length protease-helicase. All the crystal structures in the figure were rendered in 3D using Expasy\u2019s Swiss PDB Viewer (Guex and Peitsch 1997).",

Many mechanisms of single-stranded translocation have been reported, based on structural and biochemical data. Panels (a) and (b) describe the stepping mechanism of helicase translocation. Amongst the stepping mechanisms, panel (a) represents the \u201cInchworming\u201d model of helicase translocation. This model is often used to describe the translocation of monomeric helicases with two nucleic-acid-binding sites. The two sites cycle between tight binding and weak moving as dictated by their NTP ligation states, and associated conformational changes. One cycle of inchworming is typically completed in a set of six conformational changes, with the two binding sites (or domains) always retaining their position on the nucleic acid relative to each other constant. Panel (b) describes the \u201cRolling\u201d mechanism. This model is often used to describe the translocation of dimeric helicases. In this model, the two subunits alternate their positions on the nucleic acid as they change their NTP ligation states. Panel (c) describes the \u201cBrownian Ratchet\u201d model reported for the translocation of Hepatitis C virus NS3 helicase domain. In this model, the enzyme\u2019s binding affinities for the single-stranded nucleic acid are modulated by its ATP ligation state. ATP binding weakens its affinity while ATP hydrolysis results in tight binding. In its weakly bound state, the enzyme could ratchet back and forth on the single-stranded substrate. Panel (d) represents one of the many possible NTP ligation and nucleic-acid occupancy states for the \u201cSequential hydrolysis\u201d mechanism proposed for T7 gene4 helicase. Here, the enzyme contacts the ssNA two subunits at a time. NTP hydrolysis results in translocation of the helicase and the transfer of the ssNA substrate to the adjacent subunits.",

The energy from NTP hydrolysis can be used by the helicase just for single-stranded translocation, and the enzyme relies on thermal fraying to break the base pair. This mechanism is referred to as the Passive mechanism (A) On the other hand, the energy from NTP hydrolysis is used for translocation as well as for destabilization of the base pairs (shown as a gray cloud) on the duplex, to enable strand-separation. This mechanism is referred to as the active mechanism (B).",
