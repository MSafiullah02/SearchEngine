            "text": "The mode of binding of oligosaccharides to griffithsin, an antiviral lectin from the red alga Griffithsia sp., was investigated by a combination of X-ray crystallography, isothermal titration calorimetry, and molecular modeling. The structures of complexes of griffithsin with 1?6a-mannobiose and with maltose were solved and refined at the resolution of 2.0 and 1.5 \u00c5 , respectively. The thermodynamic parameters of binding of 1?6amannobiose, maltose, and mannose to griffithsin were determined. Binding profiles of 1?6a-mannobiose and mannose were similar with K d values of 83.3 lM and 102 lM, respectively. The binding of maltose to griffithsin was significantly weaker, with a fourfold lower affinity (K d = 394 lM). In all cases the binding at 308C was entropically rather than enthalpically driven. On the basis of the experimental crystal structures, as well as on previously determined structures of complexes with monosaccharides, it was possible to create a model of a tridentate complex of griffithsin with Man 9 GlcNAc 2 , a high mannose oligosaccharide commonly found on the surface of viral glycoproteins. All shorter oligomannoses could be modeled only as bidentate or monodentate complexes with griffithsin. The ability to mediate tight multivalent and multisite interactions with high-mannose oligosaccharides helps to explain the potent antiviral activity of griffithsin. Proteins 2007;67:661-670.

            "text": "Griffithsin is one of a number of lectins that have been shown to exhibit significant activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), as well as against several other enveloped viruses. 1 Griffithsin was originally isolated from the red alga Griffithsia sp., collected from the waters off New Zealand, as part of a program at the National Cancer Institute to screen natural product extracts for their ability to inhibit the cytopathic effects of HIV. 2 This lectin was shown to inhibit the cytopathic effects of different isolates of HIV-1 at concentrations as low as 43 pM, 2 as well as exhibited activity against viruses such as the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 3 Crystal structures of two different recombinant forms of griffithsin, 3 cloned with and without additional residues on the N terminus of the protein, 4 have shown it to be a domain-swapped dimer belonging to the b-prism-I (jacalin-related) family, 5 with each molecule exhibiting almost perfect internal three-fold symmetry. Crystal structures of the complexes of griffithsin with monosaccharides such as mannose and N-acetyl glucosamine, obtained by cocrystallization and/or soaking, have shown that each molecule contains *Correspondence to: Alexander Wlodawer, Macromolecular Crystallography Laboratory, NCI, Frederick, MD 21702-1201. E-mail: wlodawer@ncifcrf.gov three binding sites that form an almost perfect equilateral triangle, with each side $15 \u00c5 long. We have postulated that multivalency of binding might be the reason for the potency of this lectin, 3 yet attempts to obtain experimental structures of complexes in the presence of oligosaccharides, such as Man 9 GlcNAc 2 , that are commonly found on viral envelope glycoproteins such as HIV1 gp120, 6 Ebola virus gp1 7 and the SARS coronavirus spike proteins 8 have so far been unsuccessful. The unique structure of griffithsin, which includes six independent sugar binding sites, provides opportunities to bind multiple individual sugars on large oligosaccharides such as Man 9 GlcNAc 2 , while viral envelope glycoproteins such as gp120 present an estimated 11 high mannose oligosaccharides to which griffithsin can bind. 8 The importance of multivalency for antiviral lectin potency has previously been elaborated for the anti-HIV protein cyanovirin-N. 9 The combination of multiple targets on one oligosaccharide together with an antiviral protein containing several lectin domains results in multivalent interactions, which are likely responsible for the unusual potency of griffithsin and also the difficulty in obtaining structural data on these large complexes. Thus a combination of crystallography, modeling, and biophysical measurements was found to be necessary in order to explain the antiviral properties of this potential future pharmaceutical agent.",

The crystal structure of snowdrop agglutinin 17 was obtained from the PDB database 18 (accession code 1msa). Oligomannose glycans were docked to single domains or molecules of griffithsin and agglutinin, respectively, by overlaying the required terminal mannose residues of Man x GlcNAc 2 on the experimentally determined mannose residues in the appropriate binding sites, and using simulated annealing to minimize the oligosaccharide structure while keeping the terminal oligosaccharide residues in the binding sites and the protein tertiary structure fixed. In all cases, minimal changes were needed to the protein side chains in order to accommodate the glycans. For bidentate binding of Man 9 GlcNAc 2 to agglutinin, the side chain conformation of Lys38 had to be adjusted to remove steric clashes, and for tridentate binding of Man 9 GlcNAc 2 to griffithsin, the side chain conformation of Tyr28 had to be adjusted very slightly in both the A and B molecules. The distances between the binding sites were taken as the distance between the C1 atoms of the monosaccharides in the binding sites. Similarly, the distance between an oligosaccharide residue and a binding site was taken as the distance between the C1 atom of the glycan residue and the C1 atom of the residue in the binding site.

As demonstrated by the isotherms (Fig. 3 , Table III ), all sugars exhibited weakly exothermic (negative DH values) binding with griffithsin. The binding isotherms were fitted to Although the bindings of the glycans at 308C were mildly exothermic, in all three cases the interactions were entropically favored (TDS were two orders of magnitude larger than DH). Such a large positive change in the entropy could only be due to that of the water molecules being excluded from the binding interface, and this then providing the driving force for association, outweighing any loss of translational and configurational entropy of the ligand or the side chains of the protein at the binding site. The higher affinity of griffithsin for 1?6a-mannobiose compared to mannose can then be rationalized by the larger glycan displacing more water from the binding site. The weaker binding of maltose compared to mannose or 1?6a-mannobiose suggested that either less water was excluded or that conformational entropy of the ligand was lost upon binding (the latter being consistent with the much greater degree of order seen for the bound maltose glycan compared to 1?6a-mannobiose, Fig. 2 ). The negative enthalpies of binding indicated that favorable protein-ligand interactions (polar, van der Waals, and hydrogen bonds) compensated for any loss of solvation. The similarities in values of DH for the glycans were consistent with the glycans making similar numbers of contacts to the protein (an extra hydrogen bond, for example, would be worth an additional 2 kcal/mol).",

The separation of the three adjacent mannose binding sites on griffithsin was relatively small, each approximately 15 \u00c5 apart from the others. Man 9 GlcNAc 2 (Fig. 4A ) was modeled to interact in a tridentate fashion to these three binding sites, in all three possible configurations (i.e. independent of which terminal mannose residue was bound to which binding site). In the model discussed here, Man11 corresponds to the terminal mannose of the D1 arm, Man8 to the terminal mannose of the D2 arm, and Man6 to the terminal mannose of the D3 arm of Man 9 GlcNAc 2 (Fig. 4B ). The resulting structure had all of the glycosidic linkages within their observed experimental ranges (Table IV) , corresponding to one of the minimum energy conformations of the oligosaccharide. 16 None of the smaller oligomannose glycans appeared to be able to bind to griffithsin in a tridentate fashion. Each of the three Man 8-GlcNAc 2 isomers (missing the terminal mannose on either of the D1, D2, or D3 arms) could form a bidentate complex using the two remaining terminal mannose residues, as could the three Man 7 GlcNAc 2 isomers missing either residues D2 and A, residues D3 and B or residues D1 and C Man 9 GlcNAc 2 . The most common Man 5-GlcNAc 2 isomer (missing terminal mannose residues on the D1, D2, D3 arms as well as the removal of a second mannose residue from the D1 arm) could only form a mondentate complex with griffithsin, binding of residue B giving a minimum distance of 6 \u00c5 between residue C and the nearest binding site. Thus, Man 9 GlcNAc 2 could bind to griffithsin with high affinity by interacting with up to three binding sites whereas Man 5 GlcNAc 2 could only bind in a mondentate fashion.",

It was not possible to model tridentate binding of Man 9 GlcNAc 2 to snowdrop agglutinin (i.e. with all three terminal mannose residues binding to the protein) because of the relatively large separation of the mannose binding sites on the protein (binding sites are separated by 20 \u00c5 or more). It was possible to dock Man 9 GlcNAc 2 to snowdrop agglutinin with two of the terminal mannose residues (on the D1 and D3 arms) binding to the protein (either sites A112 and B112, or sites C112 and D112 labeled as in the PDB file). However, this required significant distortions to the usual torsion angles for at least two of the glycosidic linkages in the oligosaccharide (Table IV) . For instance, the Mana1?2Man linkage of the D3 residue had to be in a conformation with /, w values in the region of \u00c0908, \u00c0808. This linkage is normally only observed with /, w values in the region \u00fe708, \u00c01058. 15 It was not possible to model bidentate binding of any smaller oligomannose oligosaccharides to snowdrop agglutinin.

            "text": "The combination of crystallographic and calorimetric data for the complexes of griffithsin with carbohydrates was useful in elucidating a number of aspects of sugar binding to this protein, including its specificity for mannose. The only stereochemical difference between the glucose and mannose residues of maltose and 1?6amannobiose was in the conformation at the C2 carbon of the sugar ring. Oxygen O2 pointed in the opposite direction in the structures of the two complexes, but in neither of them was it found to be involved in hydrogen bonds other than to solvent molecules. Therefore, it would appear that the principal binding site of griffithsin should not be specific for either mannose or glucose. However, in examining the calorimetric titration data, we observed clear distinction between the bindings of maltose and that of 1?6a-mannobiose (or mannose). The mannose-containing sugars bound griffithsin with more that fourfold greater affinity than did maltose. In addition, precipitation was observed only after addition of 1?2a-mannobiose and 1?3a-mannobiose to the protein solution but not 1?6a-mannobiose. If this precipitation is due to crosslinking then the lack of precipitation with the 1?6a-mannobiose could be explained by limited accessibility of the second mannose to additional griffithsin molecules. Additional studies are planned to further clarify this result.",

            "text": "Crystal structures and modeling results clearly indicated that in order to bind larger carbohydrates with high affinity, griffithsin utilizes multiple, monosaccharide-specific binding sites in a multivalent binding mode. In this respect this algal lectin is very different from other antiviral proteins of cyanobacterial origin, such as cyanovirin, 21 scytovirin, 22 or MVL, 23 which achieved high affinity through an extended binding site. The latter lectins specifically recognized larger oligosaccharide structures on the terminal branch (cyanovirin), D3 arm (scytovirin), or four-five units of the oligomannoside core (MVL). Griffithsin is also significantly different from other multivalent lectins such as mannose-binding protein (MBP). MBP consists of trimeric units of carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs), each CRD monomer of the trimer having one low-affinity mannose binding site (K d $ 3 mM). Each CRD trimer is attached to a long collagen-like domain and these oligomerize to form tetramers to hexamers of trimers, each MBP oligomer having twelve to fifteen mannose binding sites. However, the arrangement of these binding sites is such that a single oligomannose molecule cannot interact with more than one CRD. Thus, high affinity is only achieved by multiple binding to multiply presented oligomannose molecules on a cell surface, 24 as discussed above for agglutinin. Conversely, such high affinity for individual oligomannose glycans is likely to be responsible for the potent antiviral activity displayed by griffithsin against enveloped viruses such as HIV and the SARS coronavirus.",

Partial stacking of mannose molecules 21 and 22, 41 and 42, and 51 and 52 is observed in the complex with 1?6amannobiose. Nevertheless, the conformation of the second carbohydrate agreed very well with the model of binding of Man 9 GlcNAc 2 , even though only the structures of the three terminal mannose residues were used to create the model discussed here.

That structure, refined at 3.0 \u00c5 resolution, 25 included two complete molecules (A and B) of Man 9 GlcNAc 2 . Each of them made extensive contacts with the protein and carbohydrate molecules related by crystallographic symmetry and they exhibited some significant differences, although their overall structures were generally similar (Fig. 4C) . The largest differences, including a significant departure from ideal geometry, were present in the link between the D3 and B mannoses. The distances between the terminal sugars, defined as distances between their C1 atoms, were 13.2, 14.1, and 17.9 \u00c5 for molecule A, and 11.2, 13.2, and 13.7 \u00c5 for molecule B. The extreme distances (11.2 and 17.9 \u00c5 ) both involved the D3 mannoses. By comparison, the (A) Chemical structure of Man 9 GlcNAc 2 , with the three terminal mannose residues that make direct contact with griffithsin colored green.

Although all modeling results must be interpreted with care, we are confident that the proposed mode of interactions is at least feasible and it explains the known properties of griffithsin. The multiple binding sites of this lectin also explain why this protein was usually precipitated upon addition of multivalent carbohydrates. It must be stressed, however, that this property should not necessarily interfere with the antiviral activity of griffithsin, because obstruction of the carbohydrates on the viral envelope by crosslinking might be as efficient in preventing fusion as the proper, multivalent interactions with a single molecule. This does, however, explain our inability to obtain crystals of the complexes of griffithsin with carbohydrates that contain more than two sugar units. Interestingly, the terminal D1 mannose in the 2G12 complex contacts a different antibody molecule than the terminal mannoses on the D2 and D3 arms, proving that, even in that case, Man 9 GlcNAc 2 is involved in making intermolecular interactions with molecules related by crystallographic symmetry.
