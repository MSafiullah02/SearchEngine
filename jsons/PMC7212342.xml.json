Below are the rationales for applying Grounded Theory: verbal strategies for lying are dynamic structures of the language used by speakers during their ongoing interaction with their audiences, while the Grounded theory is for phenomena that \u201care not conceived of as static but as continually changing in response to prevailing conditions\u201d (Corbin and Strauss, 1990). Moreover, unlike most studies on lying in which responses are categorized dichotomously into truth-telling or lying, verbal strategies for lying could take many different forms and involve truthful statements, the speakers make \u201cchoices according to perceived options\u201d (Corbin and Strauss, 1990). Finally, children in this study were seen as \u201chaving, though not always utilizing, the means of controlling their destinies by their responses to conditions\u201d (Corbin and Strauss, 1990); therefore, this study did not only aim to \u201cuncover relevant conditions but also to determine how the actors under investigation actively respond to those conditions\u201d (Corbin and Strauss, 1990).",

Second, they read the original transcript of all the participants\u2019 responses. Third, they independently labeled each response with a provisional conceptual term (e.g., \u201clearned by watching TV\u201d) in Excel 2010. If a response is perceived as resembling the same conceptual term proposed before, then the response is labeled with that conceptual term; otherwise, a new conceptual term should be proposed. A response could be labeled with multiple terms, listed on multiple columns in Excel. Fourth, after labeling all the responses, the graduate students used the \u201cfilter\u201d in Excel to compare all the responses under the same conceptual term, and then across different conceptual terms. A term would be discarded unless it stood up to continued scrutiny through its repeated proven relevance to the phenomenon under question. Conceptual terms (e.g., \u201clearned by watching TV,\u201d \u201clearned by reading books\u201d) pertaining to the same phenomenon were grouped to form the same categories (e.g., \u201ccapability attribution\u201d), which are higher-level, more abstract concepts. Fifth, the first author of this report read the concepts and all the responses under each concept and then discussed with the graduate students for new insights and increased theoretical sensitivity. Conceptual terms were revised (e.g., \u201clucky\u201d to \u201cfortune attribution\u201d) to systematically resemble the full range of variation of the phenomena. A codebook was then developed based on the final conceptual terms. Finally, two trained coders coded each participant\u2019s linguistic strategy for lying according to the codebook. For all the codes, coder agreements were higher than 80%, kappa values higher than 0.70. The final frequency of each code was obtained after the coders reached consensus through a discussion about the initial disagreements.",
