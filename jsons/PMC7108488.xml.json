Between January 2010 and June of 2012, 2638 children were enrolled, of whom 2358 had final radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Of this cohort, 2219 had specimens tested for both viruses and bacteria and were included in the current analyses (Figure 1). Children with recent hospitalization, tracheostomy, cystic fibrosis, or severe immunosuppressive conditions were excluded [1]. Demographic and clinical data were obtained using previously described methods. Typical bacteria were detected by cultures of blood, pleural fluid, and/or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens and by PCR testing of blood or pleural fluid specimens as described elsewhere [1]. Atypical bacteria, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, were detected by PCR analysis of combined nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. Human adenovirus (hAdV), human coronavirus (hCoV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human rhinovirus (hRV), influenza A and B virus, parainfluenza virus (PIV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were also detected by PCR analysis of combined nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. Serologic testing for hAdV, hMPV, influenza A and B viruses, PIV, and RSV was also performed on acute and convalescent specimens in 44% of children [1]. The parent study protocol was approved by the University of Tennessee Health Science Center Institutional Review Board, informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians in all cases, and assent was obtained from participants when appropriate.",

Children with only viruses detected were more likely to be black than children with only typical bacterial or atypical bacterial pathogens. The age distribution and race of children with virus-bacterium coinfection most closely resembled those with viral infection alone (Table 1). Children with typical bacterial infection alone, atypical bacterial infection alone, or virus-typical bacterium coinfection were more likely to have no previous underlying medical conditions and less likely to have asthma than children with viral infection alone. No striking differences in body mass index or vaccination history were observed among types of infection. Children with a diagnosis of atypical bacterial infection alone were more likely to have received antibiotics prior to admission than the other groups (Table 1).",

Among commonly identified pathogens, influenza virus was not detected with Haemophilus influenzae, and M. pneumoniae was not detected with S. pyogenes or H. influenzae. S. pneumoniae was detected in association with the major viruses detected here in roughly equal proportions (Figure 2). For many other pathogen pairings, however, the distribution of pathogen pairings was different than expected by chance (Figures 2 and 3). For example, hAdV and hRV were detected together more commonly as a pair than expected, based on their relative frequency of detection in the EPIC study; a similar pattern was observed for hCoV and RSV. Although the fifth most common pathogen detected overall, M. pneumoniae was the ninth most common pathogen codetected with other organisms; the relative infrequency of coinfections with M. pneumoniae was noted, particularly when pairings with respiratory viruses were examined (Figure 3). Several virus pairs were also observed less frequently than expected, including hMPV with hRV, PIV, or RSV; PIV with hRV or RSV; and hRV with RSV.",

Two virus-virus coinfections (RSV and hAdV vs hAdV alone; influenza virus and RSV vs influenza virus alone) demonstrated higher rates of supplemental oxygen use in the first 24 hours of hospitalization, compared with single infections alone. Other virus-virus coinfections did not lead to similar findings, and no differences in intensive care unit admission or need for mechanical ventilation were identified (Table 3). Interestingly, children with influenza virus and RSV coinfection had a shorter length of stay than those infected with either influenza virus or RSV alone. Typical bacterial coinfection with RSV was associated with statistically significant increases in the length of hospital admission and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation as compared to infection with RSV alone (Table 3). Intensive care unit admission was also twice as frequent among children with RSV-typical bacterium coinfections, but this difference did not reach statistical significance.",

The morbidity and mortality associated with influenza and bacterial superinfections is well described [6, 8, 10\u201312], but does pairing of other pathogens engender similar modifications to the disease course relative to an infection from a single agent? Are some coinfections milder than single infections because of earlier or stronger engagement of innate immune responses? Are there particular pairs (or other multiples) of pathogens that cooperate or compete, leading to different outcomes?",

When viral and typical bacterial pathogens were codetected, virus-bacterium coinfection clinically more closely resembled typical bacterial pneumonia than viral pneumonia, with these children having a higher frequency of leukocytosis, consolidation, parapneumonic effusion, intensive care unit admission, and need for mechanical ventilation and an increased length of stay, compared with the virus only group. Differences in the outcomes measured in this study did not differ between the typical bacteria group and the viruses-typical bacteria group. RSV infection alone was less severe than RSV-typical bacterium coinfection. These are important observations, as testing algorithms in current use often restrict testing for bacterial pathogens if an initial screen for viral pathogens is positive, to reduce costs and antibiotic use. This might result in some typical bacterial coinfections going undiagnosed, leading to worse outcomes. Virus-virus infections were generally comparable to single-virus infections, with the exception of supplemental oxygen use, which was higher during the first 24 hours of hospitalization in select virus-virus pairings.",

Asthma is a well-established risk factor for hospitalization with viruses [13]. The finding that asthma and reactive airway disease were more frequent as comorbidities in the viruses group as compared to the typical bacteria group is therefore not surprising (Table 1). Interestingly, the viruses-typical bacteria group had a low prevalence rate of asthma, which, when coupled with worse outcomes, could lead to the speculation that asthmatics with viral pneumonia were more likely to be admitted for reasons related to their underlying chronic diagnosis, rather than for the severity of their CAP. Alternatively, the immune status of the allergic lung could provide protection from the consequences of these infections. As has been suggested from work in animal models, this could mitigate disease severity [14]. Obesity was identified as a risk factor for severe influenza during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic [15]. Although our analyses were limited because of the preponderance of young children in this study, obesity did not appear to be a risk factor for coinfections (Table 1).",

In influenza studies, bacterial coinfection is common in severe and fatal cases [7, 11, 16]. In particular, the presence of S. pneumoniae and S. aureus is associated with high morbidity and mortality [7, 8, 17, 18]. Similarly, while very few deaths were observed during this study, serious outcomes occurred more frequently in children with virus-bacterium coinfections as compared to those virus infections, and their length of hospital stay was longer. This finding did not extend to coinfection with atypical bacteria, which may be related to a greater frequency of antibiotic use before admission (Table 1). Intensive care unit admission, use of mechanical ventilation and length of stay were also all increased when RSV was complicated by a typical bacterial pathogen. Unfortunately, despite the extremely large size of the study, the numbers of individual pathogen pairings were too low to examine other individual combinations. Of note, severe outcomes were seen in single-virus infections with all viruses studied but were more common when typical bacteria were involved.",

            "text": "One of the most interesting observations from this study was the distribution of frequencies of specific codetections. A wealth of literature from animal models and epidemiologic studies [6] suggests that viral infections enhance acquisition of bacterial pathogens by hampering immune defenses through a variety of mechanisms. Similarly, studies of the common cold in crowded living conditions suggest similar changes to susceptibility in humans to acquisition of colonization with pathogenic bacteria [21, 22]. However, prior studies have not been large enough to adequately compare the actual frequency of specific pathogen-pathogen pairs in a coinfection to the frequency expected by chance. We report that the observed prevalence of several specific codetections was lower than expected, particularly when examining virus pairings with M. pneumoniae (Figure 3). A smaller study of M. pneumoniae infections noted that codetection with viruses was rare [23]. One hypothesis to explain the relative paucity of M. pneumoniae and virus codetections is that infections with these pathogens exhibit different age and seasonal distributions. Indeed, the mean age of children presenting with M. pneumoniae in the study was 98 months, while the mean age for children hospitalized with respiratory viruses ranged from 25 months (for hAdV and RSV) to 63 months (for influenza virus) (Supplementary Figure 1). Stratification of the analyses by age (<5 years and \u22655 years) demonstrated a similar magnitude of effect as compared to the overall study population, although the CIs were wider and crossed 0 in some cases, suggesting decreased power to examine the interactions (Supplementary Figures 2 and 3). In addition, M. pneumoniae was not detected with H. influenzae or S. pyogenes, common bacterial pathogens of the upper respiratory tract. This may be due to the low numbers of bacterial infections in the study, or it may be related to competition within the upper respiratory tract between bacteria, as has been observed in bacterial coinfection models [24].",

Interestingly, an additional virus-virus interaction, hAdV and RSV, was also significantly less common than expected when analyzing only children aged <5 years (Supplementary Figure 2). The simplest explanation would be differences in seasonality that limited temporal circulation together and thus minimized the chance of a codetection (Supplementary Figure 4). Because we were studying children hospitalized with pneumonia and not a broader population, further analyses regarding the impact of seasonality were not possible. Another hypothesis is that induction of interferon by a first virus protects against the second virus. At least 2 studies have suggested that circulation of rhinoviruses delays or reduces the circulation of other viruses, as was seen in this study with hRV pairings with RSV, PIV, and hMPV [25, 26]. This and other hypotheses should be studied in model systems. Unfortunately, the prevalence of specific bacterial infections was too low for a similar analysis to be performed for specific virus and bacterium pairings. From existing observational studies and animal models (eg, mouse and ferret models of influenza virus and S. pneumoniae coinfection [27, 28]) one would have expected an increased frequency of specific pathogen pairings relative to chance. Why this was seen for hAdV and RSV and for hCoV and RSV but not other pairings is unclear; further study is indicated to replicate and potentially explain these findings.",

Detection of bacteria in patients with CAP is difficult and may have caused misclassification of some virus-bacterium coinfections into the viruses-only group. The assays to determine etiology and define classes of infections did not include all possible viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens, which may also have caused misclassification, and only 44% of children had acute and convalescent serum specimens available for serologic testing. Some results may be confounded by factors such as age, comorbidities, or strong seasonal circulation of certain viruses; the analyses were unadjusted for these potential confounders. We also could not adjust for the likelihood of hospitalization with each pathogen, which will bias the determination of the frequency of codetection in the hospital downward if patients infected with the pathogen in the community are more likely to be admitted than patients not infected with the pathogen. Finally, the contribution of any specific pathogen to the severity of infection cannot be determined with certainty; on average, 3% of asymptomatic controls (and up to 17% with hRV) in the EPIC study had a virus detected [1].",

This allowed pathogen-specific analyses that could not have been attempted with smaller studies. The findings of differences in clinical characteristics and severity of outcomes with virus-typical bacterium coinfections as compared to viruses alone and the few observed differences in comparisons of single-virus infections to multiple-virus infections or of single-typical bacterium infections to virus-typical bacterium infections have important implications for the diagnosis and management of CAP in children. In particular, better detection methods are needed for a broad array of pathogens, and studies to update clinical testing patterns should take into account these findings.",
