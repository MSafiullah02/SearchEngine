            "text": "Before a protein structure can be analyzed in light of its biological function it is necessary to validate it, i.e., to have a clear understanding of its reliability in terms of both the overall structure and of its details at per-residue level. However, an accurate and fast validation of protein structures constitutes a long-standing problem in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy [1\u20134]. For this reason, investigators have proposed a plethora of methods to determine the accuracy and reliability of protein structures in recent years [5\u201312]. Despite this progress, there is a growing need for more sophisticated, physics-based and fast structure-validation methods [1, 2, 6, 7, 11].",

We developed recently a new, physics-based methodology [34], that makes use of observed and computed {at the Density-functional theory (DFT) level of theory [40]} 13C\u03b1 chemical shifts for an accurate validation of protein structures in solution and in crystal [41]. The first step in the development of this new methodology involved determining the factors that affect 13C\u03b1 shielding calculations, such as the protonation/deprotonation state of distant ionizable groups, sequential nearest-neighbor or covalent geometry effects (i.e., due to variations in the bond lengths and bond angles of residues) and the sensitivity of the shielding/deshielding of 13C\u03b1 nuclei to changes in side-chain conformation. Once all these factors affecting 13C\u03b1-shielding have been properly identified and considered, a very important test is to determine the accuracy and speed of the computation of the 13C\u03b1-shielding as a function of the size of the basis set chosen and the Density Functional Theory (DFT) model adopted. These are important tests because DFT-based quantum mechanical (QM) calculations are very CPU demanding, despite the ever-increasing computational power available.",

This new strategy also provides a unified, self-consistent method to determine high-quality protein structures, without relying on knowledge-based information [44]. Thus, a \u03b2-sheet or an all \u03b1-helical protein structure can be accurately determined by simply identifying a set of conformations which simultaneously satisfy a number of constraints, namely 13C\u03b1-dynamically-derived torsional angle constraints and Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) derived distance constraints [29, 44].",

It is worth noting that the theory, and details, behind alternative protein structure determination and validation methods are not discussed here and, hence, the reader is referred instead to an extensive collection of such methods [1, 5\u201312, 26, 51\u201361].",

For all functionals tested in our work the characteristic mean value (xo) appears displaced from its ideal value of 0.0 by a positive, or negative, amount, e.g., for OB98 a xo = + 3.6 ppm was found. Further analysis [30] indicates that for any of the 10 functionals tested a straightforward use of the observed TMS shielding value (188.1 ppm) is not appropriate, if no further corrections are introduced. Hence, for each functional and basis set chosen it is feasible to find an \u2018effective\u2019 TMS shielding value for which the Normal (or Gaussian) fit shows a zero displacement, i.e., an effective TMS value that gives a xo = 0.0. For example, use of OB98 with a large [6-311 + G(2d,p)/3-21G] basis set leads to an effective TMS of 184.5 ppm, i.e., by subtracting 3.6 ppm from 188.1 ppm [30], that gives a xo = 0.0 ppm. Likewise, use of a small (6-31G/3-21G) basis set leads to an effective TMS of 195.4 ppm.",

Therefore, the following approximation was used: \u03bbk = 1/\u03a9 [48]; in other words, in this approximation each conformer contributes equally to the average chemical shift obtained by fast conformational averaging. Whether a computation of a Boltzmann average, rather than the arithmetic average, would lead to a more accurate representation of the 13C\u03b1 chemical shifts needs further investigation.",

For each of these conformations the 13C\u03b1 chemical shifts are computed as described in Sect. 2.1. Examination of the chemical shifts of all the amino acids in the ensemble of conformations enables us to identify the amino acid at each position in the sequence whose computed chemical shifts most closely match the observed ones, among all these conformations. This identified set of individual amino acid conformations corresponds to only one conformation of the whole chain: the \u2018theoretical minimal-rmsd model\u2019 [33]. In this model, the 13C\u03b1 chemical shift of each residue individually best matched the experimental one, thereby providing a new set of \u03d5, \u03c8, and \u03c7 torsional angle constraints for all amino acid residues in the sequence, i.e., not just for the amino acid residues in regular structures. Because the chemical shifts are a multivalued function of the \u03d5, \u03c8, and \u03c7 torsional angles, the set of torsional angles derived from the \u2018theoretical minimal-rmsd model\u2019 does not, necessarily, represent a unique solution to a given set of observed 13C\u03b1 chemical shifts values.",

Regarding this problem, it is worth noting that \u03be could be a large number because ~30% of all residues in a protein sequence are, on average, ionizable and, hence, an accurate solution would require a fast algorithm. Consequently, in all the applications mentioned in this chapter, we used the Multiple Boundary Element (MBE) method [73, 74], in which the free energy associated with the state of ionization of the ionizable groups at a fixed pH value, namely 6.5, is calculated with the general multi-site titration formalism [75, 76]. The charges and atomic radii from the PARSE (Parameters for Solvation Energy) algorithm [77] were used for the solvation free energy calculations using the MBE method, and the internal (\u03b5int) and solvent (\u03b5solv) dielectric constants of 2 and 80, respectively [76] were adopted for the calculations of <\u03c1i,k> . The value of \u03b5int = 2 is consistent with the use of PARSE charges [78] and is also commonly assumed as an adequate representation of the protein interior. Following these approximations, for a given conformation k, the average degree of ionization of the ith ionizable group of this conformation is computed as:4\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ < \\rho_{i,k} > = Z^{ - 1} \\sum\\limits_{n = 1}^{{2^{\\xi } }} {\\rho_{i,k}^{n} } [ - \\Delta G(P_{k} ,x_{k}^{n} )/k_{B} T] $$\\end{document}<\u03c1i,k>=Z-1\u2211n=12\u03be\u03c1i,kn[-\u0394G(Pk,xkn)/kBT]where Z is the partition function, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ x_{k}^{n} = (\\rho_{1,k}^{n} , \\ldots ,\\rho_{i,k}^{n} , \\ldots ,\\rho_{N,k}^{n} ) $$\\end{document}xkn=(\u03c11,kn,\u2026,\u03c1i,kn,\u2026,\u03c1N,kn) with \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ \\rho_{i,k}^{n} $$\\end{document}\u03c1i,kn = (1 or 0) is the nth protonation microstate of conformation k for protein Pk. \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ \\Delta G(P_{k} ,x_{n}^{k} ) $$\\end{document}\u0394G(Pk,xnk) is the free energy of ionization of the nth microstate of protein Pk in conformation k [75].",

Selection of the most appropriate density functional model for a particular application becomes one of the main problems of the DFT method. For this reason we decided [28] to test several density functional models (namely B3LYP, OLYP, PBE1PBE, OPBE, O3LYP, OPW91, OB98, BPW91, BPBE and B971). The benchmarking was intended to find not only the most accurate functional with which to reproduce the observed 13C\u03b1 chemical shifts in solutions but also the fastest one, in terms of CPU time, because speed of DFT calculations could severely limit their applicability to proteins.

For each of these six basis sets, combined with the OB98 functional, the 13C\u03b1 shielding was computed for 760 amino acid residues by treating each amino acid X in the sequence as a terminally-blocked tripeptide with the sequence Ac-GXG-NMe in the conformation of the regularized experimental protein structure. Analysis of the results [28], in terms of the agreement between the computed and observed 13C\u03b1 chemical shifts shows that the accuracy with which the observed 13C\u03b1 chemical shifts are reproduced by using either the small basis set (6-31G/3-21G) or the larger basis set [6-311 + G(2d,p)/3-21G] is very similar, although, use of the small basis set leads to a significant decrease in computational time.",

The basis for such a query arises from the fact that the three torsion angles \u03d5, \u03c8 and \u03c71 are not independent on each other over the whole range because they involve a common N-C\u03b1 bond [89, 90]. To find an answer to this question, the dependence of the 13C chemical shifts on side-chain orientation was investigated [35], at DFT level of theory, for two-strand antiparallel \u03b2-sheet model peptide with the amino acid sequence Ac-A3-X-A12-NH2 where X represents any of the 17 naturally-occurring amino acids considered here, i.e., not including alanine, glycine and proline. Because the majority of \u03b2-sheets are twisted, rather than planar, with a right-hand twist in the approximately \u00b130\u00b0 range for the backbone dihedral angles [91\u201394] conformational parameters for \u03b2-sheets may deviate from those for planar pleated sheets and, hence, are difficult to model by using canonical values. The fact that \u03b2-sheets in proteins appear as parallel or antiparallel strands, or a combination of both, only exacerbates the modeling problem. For this reasons, the dihedral angles adopted for the backbone were taken, and kept fixed, from the experimental structure of an antiparallel \u03b2-sheet, specifically from the 16-residue segment (G41-G56) of the B3 binding domain of protein G (PDB id 1P7E).",

This validation process involved an exhaustive conformational search, starting from an arbitrary selected conformation of the NMR-determined ubiquitin protein (PDB id 1D3Z), in which only the torsional angles of the side chains were allowed to vary, i.e., all backbone dihedral angles (\u03d5, \u03c8, \u03c9) were fixed at their corresponding observed values. Furthermore, the correlation coefficient, R, between computed, by using the Karplus equation [95], and observed vicinal coupling constants 3JN-C\u03b3 and 3JC\u2032-C\u03b3 of 17 valine, threonine and Isoleucine residues, was used to check the accuracy of the side-chain conformational search.",

Subsequently, use of NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography and theoretical studies, based on QM calculations, have continuously evolved in their ability to determine properties of the histidine residues in solution and in the solid state [43, 79, 98\u2013116]. The reason for this persistent interest in His is due to the fact that this residue is unique among all 20 naturally occurring amino acids because ~50% of all enzymes use His in their active sites [117]. This is, mainly, because of the versatility of imidazole His ring, which includes two neutral, chemically-distinct forms, referred to as N\u03b41-\u0397 and N\u03b52-\u0397 tautomers, and a protonated form, the charged H+ form, with one form favored over the other two by the protein environment and pH. In addition, His with a pK\u00b0 of 6.6 [118] is the only ionizable residue that titrates around neutral pH, allowing the non-protonated nitrogen of its imidazole ring to serve as an effective ligand for metal binding [79], or to play a crucial role in the proton-transfer process [103].",

At a given fixed pH proteins in solution exist as an ensemble of conformations and, hence, the form of each His residue among different protein conformers may vary significantly because the tautomeric equilibrium is determined by the environment [43]. Moreover, because the exchange between different protonation states is assumed to occur in the fast exchange regime [79], the NMR resonances of a given nucleus, which include rotation, protonation and tautomerization, merge into a single average signal. Decoding the information from these exchange processes offers possibility to determine the extent to which the His residues in proteins behave as free His, where the N\u03b52-H tautomer is favored over the N\u03b41-H tautomer in a ratio of 4:1 [108].",

Afterward, the gas-phase, isotropic shielding value was computed using the method described in Sect. 2.1. Finally, the distribution of the computed shielding of the imidazole ring of His was analyzed in terms of all 13C nuclei, namely 13C\u03b3, 13C\u03b42, and 13C\u03b51 (see Fig. 4). Specifically, the histogram of the shielding distribution (among all ~35,000 conformations) was fit by a Gaussian function with a mean value \u03c3o (shown as bars in Fig. 4) and standard deviation sd (data not shown). A visual inspection of the histogram shown in Fig. 4 revealed that the mean \u03c3o shielding values obtained for the 13C\u03b51 nucleus is not sensitive to changes in the form of the imidazole ring and, therefore, we confine our interest to those nuclei that are sensitive to such changes, namely 13C\u03b42 and 13C\u03b3.\n",

Let us explain the origin of this observation. On one hand, the N\u03b41 nucleus of H250 is located only 2.9 \u00c5 from the carbonyl backbone oxygen of S248 (see Fig. 5b), presumably forming a hydrogen-bond (green dots in Fig. 5b), while the N\u03b52 nucleus is exposed to the solvent but the imidazole ring is surrounded by fully protonated R264 and R266 (data not shown) and, hence, lowering the probability that a proton binds to N\u03b52, in good agreement with the computed tautomeric distribution for H250 in Fig. 5a. On the other hand, the N\u03b52 nucleus of the imidazole ring of H226 is at 3.3 \u00c5 from a backbone carbonyl oxygen of W246 (see Fig. 5c), while the N\u03b41 is at 3.1 \u00c5 from a backbone amino group of H226 (see Fig. 5c).

Among the thousands of conformations generated by the VTF approach, i.e., during the step 1 of the protein structure determination protocol shown in Fig. 1, 25 of them (see Fig. 7a) were selected by using a clustering procedure. This small set of conformation was used to determine the theoretical minimal-rmsd model that provides us with a set of \u03d5, \u03c8, and \u03c7 torsional angle constraints for all the residues in the sequence not just for those in \u03b1-helix or \u03b2-sheet regions. Using this set of torsional angle constraints (\u03d5, \u03c8, \u03c7), combined with different number of NOE-derived constraints, 2 sets of conformations of the BS2 peptide were determined after the step 2 of the protocol. One set of 20 conformations (shown in Fig. 7b) was obtained by using 118 NOE-derived distance constraints, while the other set of 10 conformations (shown in Fig. 7c) was obtained by using 130 NOE-derived distance constraints. Regardless of the number of the NOE\u2019s-derived distance constraints used, addition of the 13C\u03b1-derived torsional constraints led to a noticeably lower ca-rmsd\u2019s (2.2 and 3.5 ppm, for the set of 20 and 10 conformations, respectively) compared to the 20 models obtained by Santiveri et al. [127] who used a full set of 130 NOE\u2019s-derived distance constraints but no 13C\u03b1 chemical shift information (4.6 ppm). In line with this finding, graphical inspection of the results shown in Fig. 7b\u2013c also indicated that use of 13C\u03b1-derived torsional constraints led to sets of conformations with less side-chain torsional angle spreading, i.e., as can be seen from comparison of Fig. 7b and c against 7d, with the latter obtained by Santiveri et al [127]. In addition, the correlation coefficient, R, between the observed and computed 13C\u03b2 chemical shifts was somewhat better for the two sets obtained using the 13C\u03b1-based determination protocol (shown in Fig. 1). Thus, R is 0.99 and 0.98 for the 20 and 10 conformation sets, respectively, while R is 0.97 for the set of conformation derived by Santiveri et al [127].\n",

Our results also suggest that for a flexible molecule in solution, like BS2, it may not be possible to determine a single structure that would satisfy all the constraints simultaneously. This is a consequence of the well-known fact that NMR parameters, such as the observed NOE-derived distances and the 13C\u03b1 chemical shifts, correspond to a dynamic ensemble of conformations and, therefore, may not be reproduced exactly by a limited set of static structures [44, 128].",

In addition, a 20 ns molecular dynamics simulations (MD) using the AMBER 8.0 package [131] were performed. The MD runs yielded a plausible atomic description of the motion of BS2 peptide in solution, as revealed by both the pattern of hydrogen bonds and the generalized Lindemann parameter [132].

The protein structure determination was carried out as follows: after generation of thousands of conformations using the VTF procedure (step 1) 10 of them, shown in Fig. 8b, were selected, i.e., those possessing a maximum NOE-derived distance violation lower than some fixed cutoff value; only one of the 10 conformations produced in step 1 was selected. The selected conformation was used as a starting one in a conformational search carried out with two types of constraints: the original fixed limited NOE-derived distance constraints and the set of \u03d5, \u03c8, \u03c7 torsional angles derived from step 1. The resulting new set of 10 conformations is shown in Fig. 8c. Repetition of the step 2 with a tighter tolerance range, than in the previous iteration, for the torsional angle constraints enabled us to determine the final set of 10 conformations shown in Fig. 8d, i.e., the so-called Set-NOE-CS.\n",

These structures consistently show good values for the RFP and DP-scores as well as for global structure quality indicators. This analysis reveals that all three sets of structures analyzed here display very good agreement with the experimental NOE data, as well as dihedral angle distributions and atomic clash scores typical of good quality protein structures. Taken together, these results indicate that the 20 conformations from the 2JVD set, the DFT-computed 10 conformations from Set-NOE-CS, and each of the three chains of the X-ray structure are highly-accurate sets of conformations which represent the YnzC protein in solution.",

A validation method is considered \u2018strong\u2019 if it is able to assess how well a structure, or an ensemble of structures, predicts experimental data not used in the structure-determination process; otherwise it should be considered \u2018weak\u2019, since it is limited to reproducing the observed experimental data used in the determination of the protein models [138]. Second, it should be able to detect fast and accurately, at residue level, the existence of structural flaws. With these goals in mind a new server (CheShift) has been developed recently to predict 13C\u03b1 chemical shifts of protein structures. It is based on a database of chemical shifts computed for 696,916 conformations as a function of the \u03d5, \u03c8, \u03c9, \u03c71 and \u03c72 torsional angles for all 20 naturally occurring amino acids. The 13C\u03b1 chemical shifts were computed at the DFT level of theory using the methodology described in Sect. 2.1. Because of the large number of conformations, the computed shielding values were obtained using a small basis set (6-31G/3-21G) and later extrapolated to a large basis set [6-311 + G(2d,p)/3-21G], as described in Methods section.",

Results indicate that for all the proteins the R values obtained using the CheShift, SHIFTX [24], SPARTA [25], SHIFTS [38, 39], and PROSHIFT [23] servers were comparable, although the CheShift values were systematically lowest. This raises the following question: do these servers provide a more sensitive validation than CheShift? To answer this question we choose protein 1RGE, solved at 1.15 \u00c5 resolution [139]. The corresponding crystal structure of this protein contains two chemically identical but crystallographically independent molecules in the asymmetric unit, named here as A and B [139]. The main structural difference between molecules A and B (with an all-heavy-atom rmsd of 1.1 \u00c5) is due to differences in side chain conformations, especially those occupying different rotameric states. For this test, that do not require a comparison with the observed 13C\u03b1 chemical shifts, we computed the correlation coefficient R between the 13C\u03b1 chemical-shift predictions obtained for molecules A and B, respectively, by using five servers listed above. The results of this test give the following R values: 0.96, 1.00, 1.00, 0.98, and 1.00 for CheShift, SHIFTX, SPARTA, SHIFTS, and PROSHIFT, respectively. Except for CheShift (0.96) and SHIFTS (0.98), none of the servers is able to discriminate, beyond doubt, between molecules A and B. From a statistical point of view the R values obtained from SHIFTX (1.00), SPARTA (1.00) and PROSHIFT (1.00) servers indicate that molecules A and B are practically indistinguishable protein models. Therefore a lower R value between the predicted and observed 13C\u03b1 chemical shifts does not necessarily mean poorer accuracy but it could mean higher sensitivity to subtle structural differences. This conclusion can be confirmed by a similar analysis carried out at a higher level of accuracy, for example, by using a larger basis set and the actual geometry of chains A and B, i.e., without need for any torsional angle interpolations as with the CheShift server. In this case, the R value (0.93) computed with the larger basis set was significantly lower than the R value obtained with CheShift (0.96), or any other server, namely, 1.00, 1.00, 0.98, and 1.00 for SHIFTX, SPARTA, SHIFTS, and PROSHIFT, respectively.",

CheShift was originally developed to return a list of 13C\u03b1 predicted chemical-shift values, one for each amino acid in the sequence of a protein, except for the first and last residues [28, 33]. The validation process, i.e., the comparison between the predicted and the observed 13C\u03b1 chemical-shift values, is left to the user of the server who can use the provided information to determine the quality of the NMR structure as a whole, e.g., by computing the ca-rmsd [33]. However, it is a highly-desirable goal of any accurate validation method [11, 34] to identify the existence of local flaws in the sequence rather than only the global quality. Therefore, we added a graphical user interface (GUI) to the CheShift server. As a result, it will be possible to facilitate the validation process by displaying the differences between the observed and computed 13C\u03b1 chemical shifts by using a three-color code mapped onto a 3D protein model. This graphic validation method, far from being only an aesthetic improvement, will enable users of CheShift-2 to detect local flaws in proteins on a per-residue basis fast and accurately without the need for the user to carry out the extensive DFT calculations on which the server is based.",

However, the ca-rmsd difference between these two ensembles (~0.30 ppm) is not large enough to assure, unambiguously, that the 1TGQ ensemble needs further refinement. In fact, a similar difference in terms of rmsd, i.e., within a range of ~0.30 ppm, was found among 5 new models of the protein ubiquitin (see grey bars in Fig. 6), all of which fit X-ray diffraction data with R and Rfree factors similar to those for the deposited X-ray structure, PDB id1UBQ, solved at 1.8 \u00c5 resolution [41]. Certainly, these 5 new models can be considered to be of comparable structural quality. Consequently, variations of ca-rmsd ~0.30 ppm cannot be used as a universal criterion to unequivocally determine if a protein, such as 1TGQ, needs further refinement.",

To further test the ability of CheShift-2 server to detect small differences between protein models, a small set of 15 obsolete/successor pairs of proteins was also considered (see Supplementary Data of [49]. The results indicate that the CheShift-2 server constitutes a fast and accurate validation tool with which to determine, at the per-residue basis, the existence of local flaws in protein models even for conformations that differ in small details, as for the obsolete and successor models of Membrane-bound Lytic Murein Transglycosylase D (fragment Lysm Domain) (see Fig. 11).\n\n",
