An open data set called the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset or CORD-19 contains large set full text scientific literature on SARS-CoV-2. The Next Strain consists of a database of SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes from since 12/3/2019. We applied an unique information mining method named lexical link analysis (LLA) to answer the call to action and help the science community answer high-priority scientific questions related to SARS-CoV-2. We first text-mined the CORD-19. We also data-mined the next strain database. Finally, we linked two databases. The linked databases and information can be used to discover the insights and help the research community to address high-priority questions related to the SARS-CoV-2's genetics, tests, and prevention. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 information mining | text mining | data mining | coronavirus | SARS-CoV-2 |COVID-19| clade | mutation | genetics | tests | prevention T his paper is to answer the call to action to the Nation's 1 data scientists and AI experts to mobilize and develop 2 new text and data mining techniques that can help the science 3 community answer high-priority scientific questions related to 4 SARS-Cov-2, the deadly and novel virus, which has caused 5 a worldwide pandemic and drastic loss of human lives and 6 economic activities. 7 Recently, an open data set, namely the COVID-19 Open Re-8 search Dataset or CORD-19 (2) containing more than 40,000 9 full text scientific literature on SARS-CoV-2, was released (1, 2) 10 for researchers across technology, academia, and the govern-11 ment.

The corpus is updated weekly as new research 16 is published in peer-reviewed publications and archival services 17 like bioRxiv, medRxiv, and others.

For example, the leadership role in a social network (7, 8) is 38 measured according to centrality measures (9). Among various cen-39 trality measures, a common practice is to sort and rank information 40 based on authority. Current automated methods, such as graph-41 based ranking used in many search engines (10), require established 42 hyperlinks, citation networks, social networks, or other forms of 43 crowd-sourced collective intelligence. However, these methods are 44 not applicable to situations where there exist no pre-established 45 relationships among network nodes such as the data set SARS-Cov-46 2. This makes traditional methods difficult to apply. Furthermore, 47 current methods mainly score popular information. High-value in-48 formation can be totally different depending on specific applications. 49 Popular and authoritative information identified by the current 50 methods can be useful for marketing applications or crowdsourcing 51",
