            "text": "The articular joints have outer fibrous tissue that attaches to bone enclosing and stabilizing the joint. The innermost tissue is called the synovial membrane (Fig. 13-1\n). Except for the articular cartilage surface, this thin discontinuous villous membrane covers the inner surface of the joint. It is composed of histiocytes (A cells), which remove debris or hemorrhage, and synoviocytes (B cells), which are secretory, stromal cells that produce synovial fluid. Normal synovial fluid is composed of hyaluronic acid, lubricin (a water-soluble glycoprotein), proteinases, and collagenase. Along with lubrication of joint surfaces, the synovial fluid provides oxygen and nutrients to chondrocytes in the articular cartilage and removes their wastes. Below the surface of the membrane are blood and lymph vessels along with variable amounts of adipose tissue.",

            "text": "Collection of synovial fluid varies to some degree depending on the joint sampled. Descriptions of approaches to various joints have been described. In general, collection of synovial fluid requires the following materials: 3- to 6-mL syringe, 18- to 22-gauge 1-inch needles, and red-top and/or lavender-top tubes. The amount of restraint and necessary levels of sedation and anesthesia will vary from animal to animal. Enough restraint should be used to minimize struggling during collection. In general, many animals will require at least some degree of sedation or anesthesia. Sterile technique is critical when preparing the site and during aspiration. The fur should be clipped and the area of aspiration scrubbed. Care should be taken not to scratch the articular surface during needle insertion. Palpation and slight flexion or hyperextension of the joint will help to identify insertion points of the needle. The location of aspiration varies with the joint aspirated. The coxofemoral joint can be aspirated cranioproximal to the trochanter major and slightly ventral and caudal. The stifle should be flexed when aspirated. Aspiration can occur medial or lateral to the patellar ligament, midway between the tibia and femur. The tarsocrural joint can be aspirated by hyperextending the joint and inserting the needle lateral or medial to the fibular tarsal bone. To aspirate the shoulder, insert the needle 1 cm distal and slightly caudal to the acromion process. The elbow should be hyperextended and the needle inserted lateral and alongside the olecranon. The carpal joints can be simply aspirated by flexing the joint and palpating the joint space. The needle should be advanced slowly through the joint capsule into the joint cavity. The amount of fluid withdrawn depends on the size of animal and joint as well as the amount of effusion present. Synovial fluid will be aspirated easily if there is a significant effusion but a few drops may be obtained from joints without an increase in synovial fluid volume. Before removing the needle from the synovial cavity, the plunger should be released to remove any negative pressure. Normal synovial fluid has a gel-like consistency that should not be mistaken for a clot. The gel-like consistency will become less viscous when shaken and return to the original viscosity upon standing; this property is referred to as thixotropy. Clotting is likely to occur if there is significant blood contamination and inflamed joints may form fibrin precipitates or clots. For these reasons, some joint fluid should be put into an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tube (lavender-top tube). EDTA will interfere with tests such as the mucin clot test and culturing. The synovial fluid should be refrigerated if not being immediately evaluated. For samples that may be cultured based on the cytologic findings, the fluid should be put into a red-top tube, left in the sterile syringe, and/or placed in an aerobic culturette. There are advocates of putting fluid in blood culture media to improve the chances for bacterial growth. The laboratory should be contacted for their recommendations. In many smaller animals, only one or two drops of joint fluid can be obtained. In these cases, immediate preparation of direct smears is the critical component of sample management (refer to Chapter 1). Regardless of the amount of fluid collected, it usually is advantageous to make direct smears immediately to best preserve cell morphology. These slides should not be refrigerated before staining.",

Red-tinged fluid indicates hemorrhage or peripheral blood contamination. True hemorrhage will be uniformly discolored throughout aspiration, whereas peripheral blood contamination often occurs at the end of aspiration. This may appear as a red tail or wisp in the fluid. The fluid should be viscous as evidenced by stringiness when suspended between fingertips, touched by an applicator stick, or expelled from the syringe (Fig. 13-2A). The fluid viscosity is related to the concentration and quality of hyaluronic acid. Normal synovial fluid has good viscosity and demonstrates thixotropy (see the earlier section).",

The mucin clot test semiquantitatively assesses the amount and/or degree of polymerization of hyaluronic acid in the joint fluid. Because EDTA interferes with this test, heparin can be used if an anticoagulant is required before performing this test. One to two drops of undiluted joint fluid are added to four to eight drops of 2% acetic acid. In a sample with normal hyaluronic acid concentration and quality, a thick, ropy clot will form (Fig. 13-2B). As the amount and/or quality of hyaluronic acid decreases in various forms of joint disease, the mucin clot is less well formed. This test is typically interpreted as good, fair, or poor. Normal joints have good mucin clot results.",

            "text": "Cell counts and the differential count are done by routine methods. If enough fluid is present, cell counts can be made using a hemocytometer. Some reference laboratories use automated cell counters for cell enumeration. Automated cell counters tend to give a higher cell count than the hemocytometer; however, the difference is not usually great enough to affect the clinical interpretation. The cells may occur in clumps and accurate assessment of cell numbers may be difficult. In an effort to minimize cell clumping, hyaluronidase can be added to the synovial fluid. Various methods have been described. The easiest procedure is to add a small amount of hyaluronidase powder (amount adherent to an applicator stick) directly into the sample tube, which may result in more accurate cell counts. If only slides are prepared, cell numbers can be roughly estimated by counting the number of cells per low-power field (10\u00d7) and multiplying the count by 100 to give an approximate number per microliter. However, estimates from smears are less accurate and tend to be higher than counts from automated counters. Normal joints will have low nucleated cell numbers, usually fewer than 3000 cells/\u03bcL in the dog and 1000 cells/\u03bcL in the cat (Pacchiana et al., 2004), although more typically the count is fewer than 500 cells/\u03bcL in both species. These counts may vary slightly based on breed, age, body weight, and joint sampled. Consequently, only 1 to 2 cells per high-power field (40\u00d7) will be observed depending on the thickness of the direct smear (Fig. 13-2D). Gibson et al (1999) demonstrated the variability in performing these estimates by a group of clinicians on synovial fluid. Cells commonly observed in synovial fluid include lymphocytes, macrophages (clasmatocytes), neutrophils, and occasionally synovial lining cells that produce glycosaminoglycans. Neutrophils typically account for less than 5% to 10% of nucleated cells in normal joints. If fluid is obtained, both direct smears and concentrated preparations can be evaluated. If available, a cytocentrifuge is useful in preparing concentrated preparations. Concentrated preparations can also be prepared by centrifuging the fluid, pouring of the supernatant, and resuspending the fluid in one or two drops of supernatant. Smears can then be prepared from this concentrated preparation. Concentrated preparations are useful in synovial fluid particularly if the cell count is low (less than 500 cells/\u03bcL).",

            "text": "Some cases of joint disease are caused by bacterial (Fig. 13-4\n) or fungal infection (Fig. 13-5\n). In general, septic joints have very high cell counts. In most cases, the cells are primarily segmented neutrophils. It is important to evaluate the condition of the neutrophils. Degenerative or karyolytic neutrophils are more commonly observed with septic joints. Degenerate neutrophils have a pale, swollen nucleus with some loss of nuclear segmentation. However, often the majority of the neutrophils will appear nondegenerative in septic arthritis. In one study, Staphylococcus sp. was the most common bacterial agent isolated in septic joints (Marchevsky and Read, 1999). Organisms may gain access to joints either hematogenously or via direct inoculation. In addition, there may be infection elsewhere in the body (e.g., endocarditis) with immune complex deposition in the synovial tissue and resultant nonseptic inflammation in the fluid. Bacterial and fungal arthritis most commonly present with solitary joint involvement but on occasion may involve multiple joints, especially in young animals. Because infectious and noninfectious arthritis can have a similar presentation, it may be advisable to culture inflamed joints, keeping in mind that a negative culture does not rule out infection as the microorganisms are sometimes limited to the synovial lining tissue. Other organisms that have been implicated as causative agents of joint disease include mycoplasma; bacterial L-forms; spirochetes (Borrelia burgdorferi); protozoa (Leishmania donovani); viruses (calicivirus, coronavirus); and rickettsia/anaplasma such as Ehrlichia canis, Ehrlichia ewingii (Fig. 13-6A&B\n), Anaplasma phagocytophilum, formerly Ehrlichia equi, and Rickettsia rickettsii (Santos et al., 2006, Harvey and Raskin, 2004). In one study of E. ewingii joint infection cases in which the diagnosis was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing of peripheral blood, nucleated cell counts ranged from 16,000 to 125,000/\u03bcL with 63% to 95% neutrophils (Goodman et al., 2003).",

Types of erosive arthritis described in animals include rheumatoid arthritis, polyarthritis of Greyhounds, and feline chronic progressive polyarthritis (Carr and Michels, 1997, Oohashi et al., 2010). The classic finding is progressive loss of subchondral bone with deformation and destruction of affected joints. Infection or neoplasia may also cause erosive joint disease. Erosive arthritis, as with other types of suppurative joint disease, is characterized by increased numbers of neutrophils in the synovial fluid. Synovial fluid analysis alone cannot distinguish erosive disease from nonerosive disease; therefore, radiographs should be done on animals with inflammatory joint disease. Other clinical features of noninfectious erosive arthritis include morning stiffness, swelling of the same or multiple joints within a 3-month period, symmetric swelling of joints, mononuclear infiltrates observed microscopically in a synovial membrane biopsy, and positive RF titer.",

Changes in the synovial fluid are not as remarkable as seen with suppurative disease (Fig. 13-9A&B\n). A mild increase in the number of mononuclear cells is the predominant finding (Stobie et al., 1995). These cells are likely a mixture of macrophages, lymphocytes, and synovial lining cells (Fig. 13-9C-E). Cranial cruciate ligament rupture of the stifle (Fig. 13-9F) is associated with nonsuppurative joint disease with synovial fluid composed predominantly of mononuclear cells (large mononuclear cells with increased numbers of lymphocytes and plasma cells) along with few neutrophils (Erne et al., 2009).

            "text": "Normal synovium consists of loose connective tissue containing blood vessels, fibroblasts, adipocytes, and histiocytes lined by a layer of synoviocytes (Fig. 13-1). In a study of 35 dogs, the most common neoplasm was canine synovium (51%) of histiocytic origin (Craig et al., 2002), followed by synovial myxomas (17%), synovial sarcomas (14%), and other mixed sarcomas (17%), including anaplastic sarcoma with giant cells (malignant fibrous histiocytoma), fibrosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, and undifferentiated sarcoma. Immunohistochemical staining was necessary to distinguish between the histologic types of synovial tumors as prognosis varied greatly among them. A recommended panel of antibodies is suggested to include cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) for synovial cell sarcoma and CD18 for histiocytic sarcoma. Synovial cell sarcomas may appear most commonly as the spindle cell form (Fig. 13-12A\n) or alternatively as a mixed spindle and epithelioid variant. Histiocytic sarcomas arise from the antigen-presenting dendritic cells of the synovium layer. These neoplasms are frequently associated with Rottweilers, Bernese Mountain Dogs, and Retrievers (Affolter and Moore, 2002, Moore, 2014). Cytologically, histiocytic sarcoma displays a round cell appearance with anaplastic characteristics, including cellular pleomorphism, multinucleation, anisokaryosis, coarse chromatin, and prominent nucleoli with abundant basophilic cytoplasm (Fig. 13-12B&C). Another neoplasm occasionally encountered in the joint is metastatic carcinoma. Cases with metastatic neoplastic cells in synovial fluid have been documented arising from the lung and mammary gland (Meinkoth et al., 1997). Recently, the presence of transitional cell carcinoma from the prostate gland was diagnosed in synovial fluid as the cause of lameness in a dog (Colledge et al., 2013). Cells in the primary site and metastatic sites (carpus and stifle) were immunoreactive to uroplakin-III, a urothelial tissue marker (Fig. 13-12D).\n",

Therefore, cytology is of limited use in diagnosing myositis.

Bone aspiration can be performed with an 18-gauge needle; if there is considerable lysis, a smaller gauge needle may be used. Both aspiration and fenestration techniques can be used to obtain a specimen for cytology. Additionally, imprints of tissue obtained for a biopsy can be used for cytology. Care must be taken to blot as much blood off the biopsy specimen as possible before making the imprints.

It may be necessary to evaluate a hemogram or peripheral blood smear on the patient to determine if there are truly increased numbers of neutrophils within the sample. Observation of intracellular bacteria is diagnostic for bacterial osteomyelitis; however, culture is recommended for all inflammatory bone aspirates.",

            "text": "Fungal osteomyelitis consists of a pyogranulomatous to suppurative inflammatory process and often consists of neutrophils, macrophages, and multinucleated giant cells. Organisms are not always observed in the aspirate, so it is important to aspirate more than once and examine all of the slides. Fungal organisms known to cause osteomyelitis include Blastomyces dermatitidis (Fig. 13-16A&B\n), Cryptococcus spp., Coccidioides immitis (Fig. 13-17A&B\n), Histoplasma capsulatum, and, less commonly, Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., Geomyces spp. (Erne et al., 2007), and Sporothrix spp. Blastomyces is a round yeast organism with a double-contoured wall and broad-based bud. Coccidioides organisms are large (10 to 100 \u03bcm) blue or clear spheres with finely granular protoplasm. Histoplasma organisms by comparison are quite small (2 to 4 \u03bcm) and are easily phagocytized by macrophages and can be observed within the cytoplasm of macrophages. The organisms are round with a thin capsule and crescent-shaped, eccentrically placed, eosinophilic nuclei. Cryptococcal organisms are round with a narrow-based bud and thick, nonstaining with Wright stain, mucoid capsule.",

            "text": "Bone tumors often cause lysis or proliferation of the bone. They can be categorized as primary bone tumors, tumors of bone marrow, tumors that invade bone, or tumors that are metastatic to bone (Rosol et al., 2003). Primary bone tumors include osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, and synovial cell sarcoma (Chun, 2005). Cytologically, these tumors can be difficult to differentiate from one another. General cytologic features include round to spindle-shaped cells with basophilic cytoplasm and an eccentrically placed nucleus, with prominent nucleoli (Fig. 13-18A\n) (Reinhardt et al., 2005). Fibrosarcoma and hemangiosarcoma are less likely to have round cells, and the majority of the cells are spindle-shaped. Osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, and hemophagocytic histiocytic sarcoma have all been reported to exhibit erythrophagia (Barger et al., 2012). Within the background, osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and synovial cell sarcomas can have varying amounts of eosinophilic proteinaceous material (Fig. 13-18B). This material can also be observed within the cytoplasm. Chondrosarcomas can have a large amount of matrix in the background, which results in understaining of the cells (Fig. 13-19A-D\n). In spite of these subtle differences, these tumors can be difficult to differentiate cytologically, and biopsy with histopathology is an important diagnostic tool. Additional cytochemical testing can be done to improve the sensitivity of cytologic diagnosis of osteosarcoma. Staining of the neoplastic cells for alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity with nitroblue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate toluidine salt (NBT/BCIP) increases the sensitivity and specificity of differentiating osteosarcoma from other mesenchymal tumors (Barger et al., 2005). One limitation of this staining technique is that reactive osteoblasts will stain positive as well, so obvious criteria of malignancy must be observed before this test is performed (Fig. 13-20A\n). Positive staining is indicated by grayish-black staining of the cytoplasm (Fig. 13-20B). Previously unstained slides must be used; however, a recent study showed that previously stained slides can be destained and subsequently stained for ALP activity (Ryseff and Bohn, 2012). After staining for ALP activity, cells can be lightly counterstained with a Romanowsky stain to examine the positive cells for the appropriate criteria of malignancy.",

This aspirate contains blood with a mixture of inflammatory cells and smudged nuclei (short arrow). There are two large, blue, spherical structures in this field (long arrow) that are Coccidioides immitis spherules. The size of the spherules prevents sharp focusing on both spherules and background cells. When focusing up and down on these spherules, variable numbers of endospores may be seen within. Aspiration of fungal myelitis lesions does not always yield observable organisms (particularly Coccidioides), and if infection is suspected, culture and appropriate serology is indicated. Because of the zoonotic potential of some fungal organisms, extreme care should be taken when culturing these lesions. (Wright; HP oil.) B, Aspirate from a lytic lesion in the proximal humerus of a 4-year-old dog with a history of lameness of the left front leg. The cellularity is low and is markedly hemodiluted, with many red blood cells observed in the background. Few inflammatory cells and one Coccidioides immitis spherule are observed. The spherule is filled with many endospores, and occasionally a spherule will rupture, allowing the much smaller endospores to be visualized. It is not uncommon to find low numbers of spherules in a bone aspirate. (Wright; HP oil.)",
