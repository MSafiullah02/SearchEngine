However, much of the biological behaviour of the virus is not known and data on the tissue and cellular tropism of SARS-CoV are limited. In this study, six fatal cases of SARS were investigated for the tissue and cellular tropism of SARS-CoV using an in-situ hybridization (ISH) technique.

Infected pneumocytes were further confirmed by immunofluorescence-fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. These results provide important information concerning the tissue tropism of SARS-CoV, which is distinct from previously identified human coronaviruses, and suggest the possible involvement of novel receptors in this infection.

The diagnosis of SARS was based on the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria [16] and in these six cases, SARS-CoV was isolated from post-mortem tissues. All patients but one had received high-dose steroids and ribarvirin treatment and all died with respiratory failure. The lungs and trachea, but not the other upper respiratory tract tissues, were studied. All other major organs and tissues, except the brain, were also available for investigation. The postmortem findings were dominated by diffuse alveolar damage [10] . Virus culture results were also available. In brief, coronavirus isolation was performed using an African green monkey kidney (Vero) cell line.

The RT-PCR product corresponds to nucleotides 26 401-27 100, matching the putative membrane protein of SARS-CoV. The nucleotide sequence of this probe does not show significant homology to the genomes of other coronaviruses, including the two known human pathogenic strains 229E and OC43. The probe was labelled with digoxigenin by nick translation (DIG-Nick Translation Mix, Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Two micrograms of the RT-PCR products was incubated at 14 \u2022 C for 2 h. Completion of labelling was checked by testing an aliquot of the reaction mix on 2.5% agarose gel electrophoresis stained with ethidium bromide. Smearing and disappearance of the \u223c700 bp band were used to judge the adequacy of labelling. Formalinfixed, paraffin wax-embedded tissues were cut into 5 \u00b5m sections. After deparaffinization and rehydration, the sections were treated with microwave heating in an 800 W domestic microwave oven at medium power for 10 min in 0.01 M sodium citrate buffer. Post-fixation was carried out in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min after washing and cooling in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS). Hybridization was performed at high stringency with 2 ng/\u00b5l denatured probe at 42 \u2022 C for 16 h in 50 \u00b5l of hybridization mix [50% formamide, 10% dextran sulphate in 2\u00d7 saline sodium citrate (SSC)] under a 22 \u00d7 50 mm coverslip in a moist chamber. Excess probe was removed by washing in 2\u00d7 SSC for 5 min at room temperature. This was followed by three high stringency washes in 0.1\u00d7 SSC for 10 min at 61 \u2022 C. Immunological detection was conducted using a DIG Nuclear Acid Detection Kit (Roche) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, after incubation with 1% Blocking Reagent (bottle 5) for 30 min, the sections were incubated with sheep anti-digoxigenin alkaline phosphatase conjugate (vial 3) diluted at 1 : 375 for 2 h at room temperature. After three separate washes with washing buffer [0.1 M maleic acid, 0.15 M NaCl (pH 7.5), 0.3% Tween 20], the signal was developed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP) and nitroblue tetrazolium salt (NBT) (vial 4), which produces an insoluble blue precipitate indicating hybrid molecules. Sections were counterstained with methyl green. Cell block preparations from Vero cell cultures with and without inoculation with SARS-CoV were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The signal specificity was also assessed by (1) digestion of the sections with RNase A (0.2 mg/ml, Sigma; RNase A was pretreated by boiling at 70 \u2022 C for 10 min to remove possible DNase contaminants) for 2 h at 37 \u2022 C before the hybridization and (2) omission of the probes in the hybridization mixture. In addition, tissue sections form three autopsy cases of non-SARS patients collected during the SARS outbreak in our hospital were included as negative controls.
