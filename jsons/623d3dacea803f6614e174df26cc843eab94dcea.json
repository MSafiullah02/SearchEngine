            "text": "To the editors, During the COVID-19 outbreak pandemic, many patients developed severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), often requiring prone positioning. Despite a \"lung-protective\" ventilation, the pulmonary vascular dysfunction associated with COVID-19 related ARDS [1] can lead to right ventricular (RV) dilatation and dysfunction, both associated with poor outcomes. RV global longitudinal strain (RVGLS) assessed by transthoracic echocardiography was recently found to predict mortality more accurately than RV fraction area change (RVFAC) in COVID-19 patients [2] . However, during prone positioning, the assessment of the RV function using transthoracic echocardiography can be very challenging [3] , and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is often necessary. To date, RVFAC is still considered as the best parameter for assessing RV systolic function by TEE [4] , but like RVGLS, it requires that the entire endocardium be clearly visible, which is sometimes difficult in the setting of acute cor pulmonale(ACP) related to mechanical ventilation.",

TMAD measurements were performed on the apical four-chamber view as recommended. Three points were placed, and the software (QLAB CMQ software, Philips Medical Systems) automatically tracked and calculated the TMAD at the RV free wall (TMAD lat ) and at the interventricular septum (TMAD sep ). The RV longitudinal shortening (RVLS) was also calculated [5] . This was an ancillary study of a cohort of critical ill patients with COVID-19 infection (NCT04354558). ",

            "text": "During the COVID-19 outbreak, 54 patients requiring mechanical ventilation were admitted to our ICU for COVID-19 related ARDS (diagnosed by rt-PCR) and 17 (32%) needed prone postioning for severe hypoxia. TEE was feasible in prone positioning for the 17 patients with no related side effects. RVFAC, TMAD and RVGLS measurements were attainable in all patients. Ten patients (83%) presented moderate ACP under mechanical ventilation and 7 patients (41%) a RV dysfunction (RVFAC<35%). Median TMAD lat was 23.5[19.0-27.9]mm, median TMAD sep 8.9[7.0-11.0]mm, median RVLS 28.1[22.2-32.6]%, median RVGLS -24.7[22.6-28.5]% and median RVFAC 43.6[33.3-52.8]%. TMAD lat had the higher area under the curve (AUC) (0.88[0.73-1]; p=0.008 vs. only 0.66[0.38-0.92]; p=0.28 for RVGLS) for identifying RV systolic dysfunction with a cut-off value of 18.5 mm (sensitivity:0.8, specificity:0.7). Intraobserver reproducibility of TMAD lat was excellent (ICC=0.98[0.93-0.99]). TMAD appears to be a feasible and reproducible strain parameter for assessing the RV systolic function during prone positioning in ARDS related to COVID-19 infection. Even if RVFAC and RVGLS were achievable in all patients, these measurements can be challenging in the setting of mechanical ventilation and prone positioning. Therefore, the use of a simple and effective angle-independent tool, such as TMAD, which is not affected by the endocardial definition may be of interest. Further larger studies investigating the prognostic impact of TMAD in COVID-19 patients are mandatory.",
