By means of analytical arguments as well as extensive computer simulations, we demonstrate that the heterogeneity in infection rate can either impede or accelerate the epidemic spreading, which depends on the amount of vaccinated individuals introduced in the population as well as the contact pattern among the individuals. Remarkably, as long as the individuals with different capability of acquiring the disease interact with unequal frequency, there always exist a cross point for the fraction of vaccinated, below which the diversity of infection rate hinders the epidemic spreading and above which expedites it. The overall results are robust to the SVIR dynamics defined on different population models; the possible applications of the results are discussed.",

For brief reviews of this research topic, we refer the reader to Refs. [20, 21] and reference therein. Bauch et al. used game theory to explain the relationship between group interest and self-interest in smallpox vaccination policy [8, 9] and found that voluntary vaccination was unlikely to reach the group-optimal level. Vardavas and co-workers investigated the effect of voluntary vaccination on the prevalence of influenza based on minority game theory and showed that severe epidemics could not be prevented unless vaccination programs offer incentives [10] . Zhang et al. studied the epidemic spreading with voluntary vaccination strategy on both Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi random graphs and Barab\u00e1si-Albert scalefree networks [12] . They found that disease outbreak can be more effectively inhibited on scale-free networks rather than * wuzhx@lzu.edu.cn \u2020 guanjy@lzu.edu.cn on random networks, which is attributed to the fact that the hub nodes of scale-free networks are more inclined to getting vaccinated after balancing the pros and cons. More recently, Fu and co-workers proposed a game-theoretic model to study the dynamics of vaccination behavior on lattice and complex networks [13, 15] . They found that the population structure causes both advantages and problems for public health: It can promote voluntary vaccination to high levels required for herd immunity when the cost for vaccination is sufficiently small, whereas small increases in the cost beyond a certain threshold will cause vaccination to plummet, and infection to rise, more dramatically than in well-mixed populations. Another research line studying the effect of human behavior on the dynamics of epidemic spreading considers mainly the coevolution of node dynamics and network structure (the so-called adaptive networks [22] ), which can affect considerably the spreading of a disease [23] [24] [25] .",

Such consideration is, however, far from the actual situation. Generally, catching a disease could be caused by many complex factors and there might be great difference among the individuals in the contact rate [28] , the infection rate (or disease transmission rate) [29, 30] , the recovery rate, the cost when the individual is infected, and so forth. One example of such a scenario would be the case where the population is divided into a relatively wealthy class (e.g., representing urban residents), which is less susceptible to infectious disease being considered due to better living conditions and/or health care, and a class of relatively impoverished (e.g., representing rural residents), which is more susceptible to infection. An alternative view is to regard roughly the whole population as composed of two main groups, say, youths and adults, where the former is more resistant to disease than the latter, owning to their stronger physique and immune system.",

For the sake of comparison, we presume that only the disease transmission rate for the individuals in the two groups are distinct and other parameters, including the recovery rate, the cost of infection, and the cost for vaccination, are identical. By doing so we hope to catch any possible effects on disease prevalence and vaccination coverage caused by the variability of susceptibility. Our results presented below show that the heterogeneity in infection rate has a significant influence on disease spreading and hence cannot be ignored in the forecast of epidemic size and vaccination coverage.",

Generally speaking, because of the diversity in social conditions or lifestyles, the individuals living in an urban area would be more likely to interact with those also living the same area and less likely to interact with those in the suburb. Therefore, we consider the distinct contact pattern among the individuals to study its impact. This is done by assuming that any pair of individuals from different (the same) groups have an interaction frequency (1-). Here is restricted to the interval [0,0.5]. In the spatially structured population model, we consider two kinds of occupation of the individuals on a square lattice to introduce the diversity of interaction pattern among them. To be more specific, in the first case, the youths and the adults are arranged in a random way such that they can interact with the same frequency, which is similar to the case of = 0.5 in the metapopulation case. In the second case, the individuals are regularly prearranged to gather together with the same type of individuals [see Fig. 1(c) ].

Following previous studies [10, 11, 13, 15] , we model the vaccination dynamics as a two-stage game. At the first stage, each individual decides whether or not to get vaccinated, which will incur a cost C V , including the immediate monetary cost for vaccine and the potential risk of vaccine side effects. Individuals catching the epidemic will suffer from an infection cost C I , which may account for disease complications, expenses for treatment, etc. Those individuals who escape infection are free riders and pay for nothing. Without loss of generality, we set C I = 1 and let c = C V /C I describe the relative cost of vaccination, whose value is restricted in the region of [0,1] (otherwise, doing nothing would be better than getting vaccinated). The second stage is the same epidemic spreading processes as described before. After each spreading season, the individuals are allowed to rechoose their choice for vaccination based on a pairwise comparison rule (more details will be given below).",

The rate for any infected individual recovering is \u03bb i (t) = g. The recovered individuals do not change state and the rate for them is therefore \u03bb i (t) = 0.

As x goes to unity, the variation of the disease transmission rate among the two groups vanishes. Let us show in Fig. 2 the influence of the cross contact coefficient on the epidemic spreading in the population without a vaccinated compartment. In the case of the limit x \u2192 1, we have r a \u2248 r b , which means that the possibilities of acquiring the disease through susceptible-infected contact for the individuals from the two groups are almost the same. As a consequence, the final epidemic size f R , i.e., the average fraction of recovered individuals in the whole population, does not change much as the parameter varies. Note that with the current parametrization settings the final epidemic size without vaccination is about 89.3% for x = 1.0 [13] . As x diminishes, f R decreases considerably. This point can be understood by considering the case of \u2192 0. In such a case, as demonstrated in Appendix V, due to the concavity of f R as a function of R 0 , the decrease of epidemic size f Ra in group A cannot be offset by the increase of f Rb in group B and consequently the final epidemic size of the whole system will decrease continuously as x decreases. In particular, when the value of x is less than 0.25, the value of R 0a will be smaller than unity, which means that the epidemic cannot spread throughout group A. Hence f R of the whole population is mainly contributed by f Rb and converges approximately to a value \u2248 0.5 for x < 0.25. With the increment of , the more frequent contact between the two groups will infect more individuals in group A, while the somewhat less frequent contact among those individuals from group B has just a slight impact on the final f Rb (see Appendix V).

The simulation results are summarized in Fig. 3 , which are in good agreement with those predicted by numerically solving Eqs. (4)-(6). The overall result is that with the involvement of the vaccinated compartment, the final epidemic size will gradually decrease with the increase of f V , which is expected since vaccination can provide perfect immunity to the infectious disease and a sufficiently large fraction of vaccinated individuals can completely prohibit the propagation of the infectious disease. Though the difference between f R for x = 1.0 and that for x < 1.0 is vanishing in the limit of large f V , there exists a qualitative difference for the variation. When the individuals from the two groups interact quite frequently = 0.5, the smaller the relative disease transmission rate x is, the smaller the final epidemic size f R is. Such a dynamic scenario, however, changes when the interaction frequency among the in-dividuals from distinct groups is decreased. Specifically, a crossover behavior of f R as a function of f V emerges as the parameter drops close to zero. We notice that there arises a critical value of f V , say, f V c (whose value is about 0.45), below which the presence of heterogeneity in infection rate for the individuals from different groups can hinder the epidemic spreading, while above which the opposite effect takes place (see Appendix VI for more details). It is worth pointing out that for sufficiently small , the individuals in the two groups almost interact with others within the same group, which leads to the clustering of susceptible individuals with a high infection rate of the disease (in group B). Consequently, the disease prevalence is enlarged as compared to the case of a homogeneous interaction pattern of the two groups [e.g., the curve for x = 0.02 in the case of = 0.1 is always above that in the case of = 0.5 (not shown here)].",

The simulation results are displayed in Fig. 4 , from which we note that the final epidemic size f R decreases much more rapidly as compared to that in the metapopulation case when the vaccination level increases. When the two types of individuals are randomly prearranged, f R decreases monotonically as the variation of infection increases for each vaccination level. Noticeably, we find that the crossover behavior of f R as a function of f V still exists when the interaction frequency between the two types of individuals reduces to a very low level. From Fig. 4(b) we can see clearly that there is a crossing point near f V c = 0.1.

From Figs. 5(a)-5(c) we observe that as the value of x goes down, i.e., the heterogeneity in infection rate for the two types of individuals becomes more notable, the final epidemic level in the randomly arranged population (the open symbols) changes much more evidently than that in the case of regularly arranged population (the closed symbols). In particular, for x = 0.5, the final f R in the randomly arranged population is always greater than that in the regularly arranged population as c increases, albeit the vaccination level in the former case is slightly larger than that in the latter case for c < \u223c 0.25 [see Fig. 5(d) ]. For x = 0.3, in the randomly arranged population, though the growth trend of f R is more apparently for small c, it attains at a smaller level for large enough values of c (when the vaccination level evolves to zero), which is comparable to the case of a regularly arranged population. As x decreases even to 0.1, f R in a randomly arranged population can just grow to a much lower level as compared to that in the case of a regularly arranged population, despite the fact that the vaccination level is zero for most c values [see Fig. 5(f) ]. The reason is that the A-type individuals are difficult to infect even though they did not receive a vaccine when x is too small and as such they play the role of a natural obstructer to prevent large-scale spreading of the disease in the population. In addition, those unvaccinated A-type individuals will attract other individuals to not get vaccinated, giving rising to very low level of vaccination in the steady state [Figs. 5(e) and 5(f)]. For a regularly arranged population, however, since the B-type individuals are clustered together, they are very prone to the attack of disease, and consequently the final epidemic can reach a rather large level.",

To keep things simple, the individuals within the same group are assumed to be identical in their infection rate. The proposed model has been investigated in a simple metapopulation and spatially structured populations, with and without involvement of vaccination, by using numerical simulations as well as analytical treatments.",

To be more specific, the heterogeneity in infection rate can always give rise to a decrease of the final epidemic size provided the individuals from different groups interact with equal likelihood. Nonetheless, as the individuals become more inclined to interact mainly with others from the same group, the heterogeneity in infection rate can hinder the epidemic spreading only in the situation that the fraction of individuals vaccinated is low enough. Very surprising, this just facilitates the epidemic spreading in a regime with the presence of a large fraction of vaccinated individuals (but not large enough to eradicate the disease completely).",

Alternatively, without such considerations, we may overshoot or undershoot the desired amount of action when developing, regulating, and making vaccine policy. In addition, when individuals are allowed to change their vaccination decisions according to their experience and observations, we find that as the heterogeneity in infection rate for the two types of individuals becomes more noticeable, the final epidemic level in randomly arranged population changes much more evidently than that in the case of a regularly arranged population, hence giving us a vital clue as to how to make efficient vaccine campaign, namely, we should distribute the vaccine in the population as widely as possible so that the spreading path of the disease can be efficiently suppressed.",

We notice that the results obtained from different methods match quite well with each other. The invisible differences may be due to the finitesystem-size effect.
