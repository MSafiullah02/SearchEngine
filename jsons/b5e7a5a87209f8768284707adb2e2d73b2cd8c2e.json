            "text": "The emergence of a pandemic affecting the respiratory system can result in a significant demand for face masks. This includes the use of cloth masks by large sections of the public, as can be seen during the current global spread of COVID-19. However, there is limited knowledge available on the performance of various commonly available fabrics used in cloth masks. Importantly, there is a need to evaluate filtration efficiencies as a function of aerosol particulate sizes in the 10 nm to 10 \u03bcm range, which is particularly relevant for respiratory virus transmission. We have carried out these studies for several common fabrics including cotton, silk, chiffon, flannel, various synthetics, and their combinations. Although the filtration efficiencies for various fabrics when a single layer was used ranged from 5 to 80% and 5 to 95% for particle sizes of <300 nm and >300 nm, respectively, the efficiencies improved when multiple layers were used and when using a specific combination of different fabrics. Filtration efficiencies of the hybrids (such as cotton\u2212silk, cotton\u2212chiffon, cotton\u2212flannel) was >80% (for particles <300 nm) and >90% (for particles >300 nm). We speculate that the enhanced performance of the hybrids is likely due to the combined effect of mechanical and electrostatic-based filtration. Cotton, the most widely used material for cloth masks performs better at higher weave densities (i.e., thread count) and can make a significant difference in filtration efficiencies. Our studies also imply that gaps (as caused by an improper fit of the mask) can result in over a 60% decrease in the filtration efficiency, implying the need for future cloth mask design studies to take into account issues of \"fit\" and leakage, while allowing the exhaled air to vent efficiently. Overall, we find that combinations of various commonly available fabrics used in cloth masks can potentially provide significant protection against the transmission of aerosol particles.",

This is also of current significance as the relative effectiveness of different droplet sizes in transmitting the SARS-CoV-2 virus is not clear, and understanding the filtration response across a large bracketed size distribution is therefore important. 13 \u221216 In this paper, we report the results of experiments where we measure the filtration efficiencies of a number of common fabrics, as well as selective combinations for use as hybrid cloth masks, as a function of aerosol sizes ranging from \u223c10 nm to 6 \u03bcm. These include cotton, the most widely used fabric in cloth masks, as well as fabric fibers that can be electrostatically charged, such as natural silk.",

            "text": "Respiratory droplets can be of various sizes 17, 18 and are commonly classified as aerosols (made of droplets that are <5 \u03bcm) and droplets that are greater than 5 \u03bcm. 3 Although the fate of these droplets largely depends on environmental factors such as humidity, temperature, etc., in general, the larger droplets settle due to gravity and do not travel distances more than 1\u22122 m. 19 However, aerosols remain suspended in the air for longer durations due to their small size and play a key role in spreading infection. 14\u221216 The use of physical barriers such as respiratory masks can be highly effective in mitigating this spread via respiratory droplets. 20\u221222 Filtration of aerosols follows five basic mechanisms: gravity sedimentation, inertial impaction, interception, diffusion, and electrostatic attraction. 23, 24 For aerosols larger than \u223c1 \u03bcm to 10 \u03bcm, the first two mechanisms play a role, where ballistic energy or gravity forces are the primary influence on the large exhaled droplets. As the aerosol size decreases, diffusion by Brownian motion and mechanical interception of particles by the filter fibers is a predominant mechanism in the 100 nm to 1 \u03bcm range. For nanometer-sized particles, which can easily slip between the openings in the network of filter fibers, electrostatic attraction predominates the removal of low mass particles which are attracted to and bind to the fibers. Electrostatic filters are generally most efficient at low velocities such as the velocity encountered by breathing through a face mask. 25 There have been a few studies reported on the use of cloth face masks mainly during or after the Influenza Pandemic in 2009; [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] 26 However, there is still a lack of information that includes (i) the performance of various fabrics as a function of particle size from the nanoscale to the micron sized (particularly important because this covers the \u223c10 nm to \u223c5 \u03bcm size scale for aerosols) and (ii) the effect of hybrid multilayer approaches for masks that can combine the benefits of different filtering mechanisms across different aerosol size ranges. 9, 26 These have been the objectives of the experimental work described in this paper. In addition, we also point out the importance of fit (that leads to gaps) while using the face mask. 27, 28 The experimental apparatus (see Figure 1 ) consists of an aerosol generation and mixing chamber and a downstream collection chamber. The air flows from the generation chamber to the collection chamber through the cloth sample that is mounted on a tube connecting the two chambers. The aerosol particles are generated using a commercial sodium chloride (NaCl) aerosol generator (TSI Particle Generator, model #8026), producing particles in the range of a few tens of nanometers to approximately 10 \u03bcm. The NaCl aerosol based testing is widely used for testing face respirators in compliance with the NIOSH 42 CFR Part 84 test protocol. 29,30 Two different particle analyzers are used to determine particle size dimensions and concentrations: a TSI Nanoscan SMPS nanoparticle sizer (Nanoscan, model #3910) and a TSI optical particle sizer (OPS, model #3330) for measurements in the range of 10 to 300 nm and 300 nm to 6 \u03bcm, respectively.",

Effective area of the cloth sample during the tests was \u223c59 cm 2 . Measurements of particle size and distribution were made by sampling air at a distance of 7.5 cm upstream and 15 cm downstream of the cloth sample. The differential pressures and air velocities were measured using a TSI digital manometer (model #AXD620) and a TSI Hot Wire anemometer (model #AVM410). The differential pressure (\u0394P) across the sample material is an indicator of the comfort and breathability of the material when used as a face mask. 31 Tests were carried out at two different airflows: 1.2 and 3.2 CFM, representative of respiration rates at rest (\u223c35 L/min) and during moderate exertion (\u223c90 L/min), respectively. 32 The effect of gaps between the contour of the face and the mask as caused by an improper fit will affect the efficiency of any face mask. 21, 27, 28, 33 This is of particular relevance to cloth and surgical masks that are used by the public and which are generally not \"fitted\", unlike N95 masks or elastomeric respirators. A preliminary study of this effect was explored by drilling holes (symmetrically) in the connecting tube onto which the fabric (or a N95 or surgical mask) is mounted. The holes, in proximity to the sample (Figure 1 ), resulted in openings of area \u223c0.5\u22122% of the active sample area. This, therefore, represented \"leakage\" of the air around the mask.",

The test specimen is held in place using a clamp for a better seal. The aerosol is sampled before (upstream, C u ) and after (downstream, C d ) it passes through the specimen. The pressure difference is measured using a manometer, and the aerosol flow velocity is measured using a velocity meter. We use two circular holes with a diameter of 0.635 cm to simulate the effect of gaps on the filtration efficiency. The sampled aerosols are analyzed using particle analyzers (OPS and Nanoscan), and the resultant particle concentrations are used to determine filter efficiencies.",

In comparison, the single-layer 80 TPI cotton does not perform as well, with efficiencies varying from \u223c5 to \u223c55% depending on the particle size across the entire range. The quilt, a commonly available household material, with a fibrous cotton batting also provided excellent filtration across the range of particle sizes (>80% for <300 nm and >90% for >300 nm). Electrostatic interactions are commonly observed in various natural and synthetic fabrics. 36, 37 For instance, polyester woven fabrics can retain more static charge compared to natural fibers or cotton due to their lower water adsorption properties. 36 The electrostatic filtering of aerosols have been well studied. 38 As a result, we investigated three fabrics expected to possess moderate electrostatic discharge value: natural silk, chiffon (polyester\u2212Spandex), and flannel (cotton\u2212polyester). 36 The results for these are shown in Figure 3b . In the case of silk, we made measurements through one, two, and four layers of the fabric as silk scarves are often wrapped in multiple layers around the face (the results for two layers of silk are presented in Figure S1 (Supporting Information) and omitted from this figure) .

It is well recognized that the \"fit\" is a critical aspect of a highperformance mask. 27, 28, 33, 41 Earlier researchers have attempted to examine this qualitatively in cloth and other masks through feedback on \"fit\" from human trials. 11, 12 In our case, we have made a preliminary examination of this effect via the use of cross-drilled holes on the tube holding the mask material (see Figure 1 ) that represents leakage of air. For example, in Figure  4b , we compare the performance of the surgical mask and the cotton/silk hybrid sample with and without a hole that represents about \u223c1% of the mask area. Whereas the surgical mask provides moderate (>60%) and excellent (close to 100%) particle exclusion below and above 300 nm, respectively, the tests carried out with the 1% opening surprisingly resulted in significant drops in the mask efficiencies across the entire size range (60% drop in the >300 nm range). In this case, the two holes were \u223c0.635 cm in diameter and the mask area was \u223c59 cm 2 . Similar trends in efficiency drops are seen in the cotton/ silk hybrid sample, as well. Hole size also had an influence on the filtration efficiency. In the case of an N95 mask, increasing hole size from 0.5 to 2% of the cloth sample area reduced the weighted average filtration efficiency from \u223c60 to 50% for a particle of size <300 nm. It is unclear at this point whether specific aerodynamic effects exacerbate the \"leakage\" effects when simulated by holes. Its determination is outside the scope of this paper. However, our measurements at both the high flow (Table S1 ). The filtration efficiencies of all of the samples that we measured at both 1.2 CFM and 3.2 CFM are detailed in the Supporting Information (Figures S2\u2212S4) .",

We find that cotton, natural silk, and chiffon can provide good protection, typically above 50% in the entire 10 nm to 6.0 \u03bcm range, provided they have a tight weave. Higher threads per inch cotton with tighter weaves resulted in better filtration efficiencies. For instance, a 600 TPI cotton sheet can provide average filtration efficiencies of 79 \u00b1 23% (in the 10 nm to 300 nm range) and 98.4 \u00b1 0.2% (in the 300 nm to 6 \u03bcm range). A cotton quilt with batting provides 96 \u00b1 2% (10 nm to 300 nm) and 96.1 \u00b1 0.3% (300 nm to 6 \u03bcm). Likely the highly tangled fibrous nature of the batting aids in the superior performance at small particle sizes. Materials such as silk and chiffon are particularly effective (considering their sheerness) at excluding particles in the nanoscale regime (<\u223c100 nm), likely due to electrostatic effects that result in charge transfer with nanoscale aerosol particles. A four-layer silk (used, for instance, as a scarf) was surprisingly effective with an average efficiency of >85% across the 10 nm \u22126 \u03bcm particle size range. As a result, we found that hybrid combinations of cloths such as high threads-per-inch cotton along with silk, chiffon, or flannel can provide broad filtration coverage across both the nanoscale (<300 nm) and micron scale (300 nm to 6 \u03bcm) range, likely due to the combined effects of electrostatic and physical filtering. Finally, it is important to note that openings and gaps (such as those between the mask edge and the facial contours) can degrade the performance. Our findings indicate that leakages around the mask area can degrade efficiencies by \u223c50% or more, pointing out the importance of \"fit\".",

Due to noise in the measurements, some FE values were below 0, which is unrealistic. As such, negative FE values were removed from consideration in figures and further calculations.
