The subjects were studied again 4 to 6 weeks postexacerbation. Participants provided nasal/throat swabs, and underwent skin allergen testing and spirometry. Participants also completed the common cold questionnaire (CCQ)21and the asthma control questionnaire (ACQ).22The ACQ is a seven-item questionnaire that has been validated to measure the goals of asthma management (ie, minimization of daytime and nighttime symptoms, activity limitation, \u03b22-agonist use, and bronchoconstriction). Analysis of asthma status using this scoring system has determined that well-controlled asthma has an optimal cut point of < 0.75, while a score of > 1.50 indicates inadequately controlled asthma.22\n",

Approximately one in four people recovering from a severe asthma exacerbation with virus infection experience minimal improvement in lung function. They continue to experience persistent airway obstruction and poor asthma control. This study is the first to examine the role of lower airway inflammation in this phenomenon. We have determined that subjects with persistent airway obstruction following virus exacerbation had, at the time of the exacerbation, levels of total inflammatory cells, eosinophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes in the airway that were similar to those in stable subjects with asthma. Furthermore, the inflammatory cell profile in the lower airways of these individuals did not change postexacerbation, despite some improvement in symptoms. This is a clinically important group, as, despite the absence of inflammatory cell influx into the airways during exacerbation, their asthma symptoms were uncontrolled during the exacerbation, and, although symptoms improved 4 to 6 weeks postexacerbation, they continued to be uncontrolled.",

The poor lung function (percent predicted FEV1) observed during the acute episode significantly improved in the airway-recovery group, with values returning to levels of stable asthma patients postexacerbation. However, there was no significant improvement in %FEV1in the persistent-airway-obstruction group (Fig 1,Table 3). Thus, while the two groups were clinically similar during exacerbations, they were distinctly different at recovery. This may reflect differences in the groups before or as a result of viral infection. Due to the design of this study, preexacerbation data are not available. However, the higher dose of maintenance ICSs used in the persistent-airway-obstruction group suggests that this group had more severe illness before the exacerbation, and it is possible that they may have had preexisting airflow obstruction.",

Seemungal et al16related exacerbation length to the magnitude of acute deterioration. While the extent of acute deterioration cannot be assessed by our study design, the data inTable 2suggest that acute episodes were of similar severity in the two groups. Another longitudinal study17in COPD patients found that, over time, clinical recovery to baseline levels (FEV1and symptoms) after an exacerbation took longer. The mechanisms by which recovery rate slows over time are unclear, but it has been suggested that this may be associated with postviral increases in airway and systemic inflammation.17Our data indicated that subjects in the persistent-airway-obstruction group had a longer duration of asthma. If this group had been followed up for a longer time, a return to baseline FEV1may eventually have been observed. An alternate study design, which allowed the assessment of airflow obstruction preexacerbation, would be required to test this hypothesis.",

This is consistent with the known effects of viral infection in the airway.11Conversely, patients in the persistent-airway-obstruction group showed a lower airway inflammatory profile during exacerbations similar to those with stable asthmaFig 2, and this did not change significantly postexacerbation(Table 4). This is surprising, considering the well-established role of the neutrophil in driving an innate immune response to viral infection. However, the apparent insensitivity of lower airway inflammation to the presence of virus suggests that there is a suppression of the innate immune response in these subjects. The persistent-airway-obstruction group had been using a higher maintenance dose of ICSs than the airway-recovery group(Table 1). It is possible that high doses of ICSs may be inhibiting the generation of inflammatory mediators32such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, IL-1, and IL-6, thereby preventing the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the airways.33\n",

Virus-induced eosinophil activation may increase the release of mediators such as ECP34and leukotriene C4,35, 36which may worsen asthma symptoms. Activated eosinophils may also drive neurogenic inflammation by releasing eosinophil major basic protein, which is an endogenous antagonist for M2 muscarinic receptors. These receptors normally inhibit the release of acetylcholine, but when blocked by major basic protein, acetylcholine is released, resulting in airway muscle hyperresponsiveness.37Viral induction of vascular leakage has also been reported, with mediators such as IL-8 and ECP38being exuded into the airway lumen, which may sustain and perpetuate the inflammatory process.39Viral activation of mast cells, leading to increases in histamine release, may also contribute to worsened asthma.40Mucus hypersecretion has also been linked to viral infection.41, 42Thus, there are a range of different virus-induced mechanisms, which may exacerbate a variety of the physiologic features that characterize asthma but do not involve infiltration of the lower airways with inflammatory cells.",
