The patient had a past medical history significant for multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, peripheral vascular disease, and parathyroid carcinoma status post parathyroidectomy. A chest x-ray (CXR) revealed possible atypical bilateral pneumonia consistent with COVID-19. The patient underwent coronavirus nasopharyngeal swab testing which was negative. However, due to the possible pneumonia and close to a 30% false negative coronavirus testing by nasopharyngeal swab, the patient was admitted for further observation. After admission to the COVID-19 hospital ward, evaluation of the patient revealed she was having word finding speech difficulties and right sided weakness. MR imaging revealed a large (5.7 \u00d7 3.9 \u00d7 2.9 cm), heterogenous contrast-enhancing left frontoparietal mass causing cerebral compression, edema, and midline shift of 7 mm (Fig. 1). The patient was started on high-dose steroids and given antiepileptics. The family was counseled on the need for a tissue diagnosis and possible surgical decompression of the tumor since the patient had evidence of right sided weakness from the tumor mass effect. However, after discussion with the family and the medical team, the decision was made to just perform a stereotactic biopsy of the mass for diagnostic purposes. Since there was no possibility for any postoperative rehabilitation due to closing of the rehabilitation unit, and the high likelihood the patient had a high-grade glioma in the setting of advanced age and comorbidities, a craniotomy was not offered to the patient. The stereotactic biopsy was performed and revealed a glioblastoma tumor. She also also had a CT scan of the chest which showed improvement of the findings on her initial CXR. The patient is starting radiation therapy and temozolomide at the end of month of April 2020 and will require high dose steroids due to edema and mass effect of the tumor.",

A head CT scan showed a large (3.9 \u00d7 3.4 \u00d7 5.5 cm) mass within the sella and suprasellar cistern with sellar expansion, moderate mass effect, and some obstructive hydrocephalus. The patient was then emergently transferred to our hospital for surgical evaluation and possible CSF diversion. She then underwent MRI, which suggested a pituitary adenoma with significant displacement of the optic apparatus, cavernous sinus, third ventricle and midbrain, along with hydrocephalus (Fig. 2). She also underwent standard pituitary tumor lab work-up, with results showing normal levels of prolactin (17.2), AM cortisol (18.9), and TSH (1.049) and low levels of IGF-1 (27), free T4 (0.68), and ACTH (2.5). Given that the prolactin level was within normal limits, we did not elect to manage the tumor medically, since it was not a prolactinoma. The hydrocephalus was from the obstruction of the 3rd ventricle due to mass effect from the large pituitary tumor. The patient was brought to the OR and underwent a right frontal ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VP) shunt and endoscopic septal fenestration with a CERTAS programmable valve. The standard of care, an endoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal approach for maximal resection of tumor, was not offered at this time to the patient due to the COVID-19 crisis and the need to mitigate surgical exploration involving the nasopharynx as a nidus of infection. Instead, the patient was offered and underwent VP shunt placement to alleviate the emergent hydrocephalus. The patient did well postoperatively and was discharged to home on postoperative day two.",

The overall alignment of the spine was maintained and there was no evidence of spinal cord compression. Given the lack of neurologic compromise and overall preserved alignment of the spine, it was decided that a minimally invasive approach could be attempted by neuro-interventional radiology. The patient underwent a C2 cement augmentation. Post procedurally, the patient did very well. However, he re-presented to the emergency department (ED) with worsening neck pain, bilateral hand numbness, and pneumonia. A cervical spine CT scan showed new dissociation between the odontoid and the cemented C2 vertebral body with resulting severe stenosis and spinal cord compression (Fig. 3). Given the underlying pneumonia and stable neurologic condition, the decision was made to keep the patient on bed rest in a rigid orthosis while he underwent treatment for the pneumonia and COVID-19 testing. Once the pulmonary issues resolved and the patient had multiple negative COVID tests, he was taken to the OR for a posterior decompression and fusion from C1-3. After surgery, his pain was significantly improved and his upper extremity numbness resolved. The initial recommendation was for inpatient rehab, however after prolonged discussion with the patient and his family, it was felt that he would be safer to be discharged home with home services and family education.",

            "text": "The severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in the State of New York, and in particular New York City, has required neurosurgeons to dramatically alter their practice in a very short period of time. The diversion of essentially all hospital facilities and resources to combatting this highly contagious disease and the cancellation of all elective procedures has required a striking shift in patient management and surgical decision-making. COVID-19 provides difficulties in the treatment of all patients who necessitate hospital-level care \u2013 both medical and surgical \u2013 however it poses unique challenges in the management of neurosurgical tumor patients. This is due to several reasons, one of which is that many tumor patients tend to be of middle or older age, and the death rate for COVID-19 is significantly higher in older adults and for those with various cardiopulmonary comorbidities [4, 5]. Patients with diabetes mellitus are also at much higher risk for severe complications [6, 7]. Second, patients with malignant brain or spine tumors may have undergone chemotherapy prior to surgical resection or in between subsequent resections, thus placing them in an immunocompromised state and further increasing their risk of acquiring COVID-19 [8]. Patients who have metastatic disease are also often immunosuppressed on systemic chemotherapeutic agents. Due to the highly contagious nature of COVID-19, it has even been recommended that cancer patients avoid treatment regimens that cause immunosuppression or have their dosages reduced should they become infected [9]. These are clearly dramatic changes from normal clinical practice, which reflect the severity of the COVID-19 virus. Risks of acquisition are only further exacerbated when a significant surgical procedure occurs that then necessitates a prolonged hospital stay. Taking the aforementioned aspects into consideration changes the calculus of the preoperative risk assessment but represents only one component of the surgical decision-making thought process needed in light of COVID-19.",

            "text": "For the cranial tumor surgeon, several factors come into play in deciding if and when to operate. In case #1, the patient was originally admitted to the hospital for pneumonia-like symptoms, suspicious for COVID-19. She later experienced a variety of neurological symptoms, including focal deficits, completely unrelated to any prior medical history or her infectious workup. She was incidentally found to have a very large mass lesion with compression of surrounding structures, the likely cause of her new symptoms, and started on high-dose steroids. At Mount Sinai in the COVID-19 era, there have been no changes to the use or dosing of steroids to treat edema from brain tumors. Of note, steroids are even being used for patients with COVID-19 who experience acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [10]. Under non-COVID-19 circumstances, the routine care at our institution would have been maximal surgical resection with preservation of neurological function given that her lesion was in a surgically-amenable location. However, neurorehabilitation services are presently not available due to the closing of the normal rehabilitation unit and the rerouting of all its staff to COVID-19 units. As such, the decision to solely conduct a stereotactic biopsy for histopathologic analysis represents a deviation from our typical standard of care. While entirely out of the neurosurgeon\u2019s control, this is a serious issue for patients with malignant lesions, which are obviously time-sensitive for growth, in that these lesions can no longer be resected in a timely manner as there is now no postoperative care for them. The reasoning for the stereotactic biopsy in this case was that at the very minimum, there would be a definite diagnosis for this severely symptomatic patient, which could elucidate whether the tumor had malignant features. Additionally, a clear tissue diagnosis, despite the present incapability for maximal resection, would guide further treatment, including possible radiation therapy and chemotherapy, and patient expectations about next steps. This change from not offering maximal surgical resection for a tumor with clear effects of edema and compression is a remarkable departure from our traditional practice. Our decision-making shares similarities with the neuro-oncologic community consensus at this time for the treatment of gliomas, in that diagnostic surgery and adjuvant therapy can be delayed if the patient is stable and if further tumor expansion will not hinder complete resection later on [11].",

Specifically, this is due to the high nasal viral titers and the potential for aerosol production during endonasal instrumentation. One particular study simulated surgical aerosolization during non-powered instrumentation, suction microdebrider, and high-speed drilling in cadavers after nasal fluorescein application [13]. They found that an intact surgical mask and VENT mask for endoscopy removed all detectable spread of aerosol particles. In addition, microdebrider and cold instrumentation use did not produce detectable aerosols, however high-speed drill generated remarkable aerosol spread, with significant risk to the endoscopic skull base surgeon.",

Given the high likelihood of a COVID-19 etiology of the pneumonia and the fact that the patient was mostly neurologically intact, the decision was made for the patient to be treated for the infection first, while being maintained in rigid orthosis in bed, and await surgery until the pneumonia had cleared. In non-COVID-19 times, patients with pneumonia are generally not operated on unless it is a surgical emergency. That is consistent with the management plan here. However, given the highly contagious nature of COVID-19 and its potential complications, extra precautions were taken to ensure the pneumonia was entirely cleared prior to bringing the patient to the OR. In other words, the preference was for the patient to be maintained in rigid orthosis as long as necessary, which is a change from standard of care.",

Our surgical decision-making process for tumor cases in light of COVID-19 is overall consistent with their global approach.

Transmission of the virus necessarily increases in the close proximity of the hospital, placing both medical staff and patients at risk. Specifically, the intubation process is considered one of the highest risk procedures for viral droplet spread [18, 19]. As the vast majority of neurosurgical procedures are conducted under general anesthesia, minimizing cases to those that are only truly emergent also protects our anesthesiologists, neurosurgeons, residents, and OR staff from acquiring the virus. As was done in our institution\u2019s tumor cases described above, maximal OR precautions were taken at all times throughout the intubation process and in the post-operative setting. Patients were generally considered to be COVID-19 positive until proven otherwise, and multiple rounds of testing were sent as soon as possible, when available. Furthermore, not taking away from other needed hospital resources, including ICU beds with ventilators, nursing capabilities, and personal protective equipment (PPE), should be considered in circumstances in which delaying surgery causes no harm to the patient. It is important to note that different hospitals have varying levels of available resources, and given that our institution is a large tertiary-care academic hospital at the epicenter of the pandemic, our facilities may differ widely from those at community hospitals. Such differences necessarily impact patient management in a time of crisis.",

In this report, we provide examples of the Mount Sinai Hospital (New York, NY) neurosurgical experience and clinical reasoning for the changes in management of brain and spine tumors. We continue to operate on neurosurgical emergencies, evaluate tumors on a case-by-case basis, and make alterations or delay procedures when clinically feasible without causing any harm to the patient. While we would operate on all the cases above in a timely fashion under normal circumstances, the reality of the COVID-19 pandemic necessitates that neurosurgeons balance providing the best care for their patients while minimizing the spread of the virus.",
