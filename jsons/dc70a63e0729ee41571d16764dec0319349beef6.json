Like the rest of the world, Downtown Los Angeles, California in the United States are experiencing an unprecedented massive outbreak of COVID-19 infections. Majority of the infected patients experienced mild to moderate symptoms, requiring supportive care with selfisolation at home. Unfortunately, there are significant and a rising number of patients requiring hospitalization. Among more severe cases, most patients experience respiratory distress leading to intubation and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) care. COVID-19 can also present itself in a variety of ways. According to Wu et al (Wu et al., 2020) , they outlined their experience with nervous system involvement, which was recently acquired from the Wuhan, China outbreak. This affected the rest 3 of the world as we are beginning to experience such deviation from our Emergency Room presentation first hand in Downtown Los Angeles, California, United States.",

She was awake, alert, lethargic but coherent. She followed commands well and was oriented to name, place, time and situation. Her neck was stiff and photophobia was present. She has non-focal body exam with normal tone, bulk and strength. Her sensory examination was normal. CT of the head without contrast was normal. Her cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed 70 white cells with 100% lymphocyte. CSF red cells was 65, protein was 100 and glucose was 120 (serum glucose was 200). Her chest x-ray was clear.

Serial chest x-ray as well as a chest CT were normal. Neurologically, she experienced worsening encephalopathy with disorientation and hallucinations. She became lethargic and oriented to name only. There was no seizure recurrence after initiation medication of levetiracetam. EEG showed generalized slowing with no epileptic discharges.

After 72 hours, results came back positive. She was started on hydroxychloroquine. Her mentation began to improve by day five of admission. She was able to ambulate, eat and use the bathroom. Her hallucinations remained intermittently.By the day of this writeup submission (day nine of admission), we are still unable to send CSF specimen for PCR testing through local commercial, government or academic laboratories to confirm for COVID-19. Hence, we cannot directly prove the existing of COVID-19 virus in the CSF. Wu et al (Wu et al., 2020) has suggested the nervous system involvement (viral encephalitis) as additional to the respiratory failure and systemic disease. In this case, we have observed a COVID-19 infection presenting as an isolated meningoencephalitis without respiratory involvement.",
