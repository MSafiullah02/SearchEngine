Pregnant women are thought to be at an increased risk of acquiring infections due to the underlying immune system modulations that are necessary to prevent fetal rejection in the gravid state [2]. There are two vector-borne infectious diseases, malaria and dengue fever, which disproportionately affect impoverished individuals and impose a major economic burden on developing nations [3]. Unfortunately, these infections are associated with an increased severity during pregnancy and worse maternofetal outcomes, an alarming issue that has only recently come to light and is currently being systematically studied [4, 5].",

            "text": "Malaria is a parasitic infection caused by the eukaryotic pathogen Plasmodium and is highly prevalent in the tropical countries of the global south, such as Pakistan [6]. The Plasmodium parasite is transmitted to humans from the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito with P. falciparum and P. vivax being the most frequently encountered species [6]. Interestingly, more than 60% of the Pakistani population is at risk of malarial infection with an estimated 100,000 new cases and approximately 1000 malaria-related deaths occurring annually [7]. In addition, malaria is currently recognized as an important risk factor not only for adverse obstetric outcomes including miscarriage, maternal anemia, cerebral malaria [4] but also poor fetal outcomes such as preterm delivery and intrauterine growth restriction [8\u201310]. In contrast, dengue fever is a viral infection caused by the \u201cdengue virus\u201d of the flavivirus family and can cause serious illness even leading to death in some cases. For example, Ong et al. reported a case fatality rate of 5.4% among non-pregnant adults with dengue hemorrhagic fever [11]. Interestingly, while the worse outcomes of malaria in pregnancy are well documented, data on the impact of dengue fever on pregnancy outcomes are sparse and conflicting. Several studies have described an increased risk of vertical transmission leading to preterm birth [12, 13], still birth [14] and low birth weight [12]; however, results have been inconclusive [15]. In addition, there is evidence that dengue fever outcomes correlate with disease severity as categorized by the World Health Organization (WHO) [16].",

As such, the WHO estimates that nearly 400 million dengue cases and more than 200 million malaria cases occur annually, highlighting the immense burden of this public health problem [21, 23]. While there are robust data examining the clinical course of dengue and malaria, the outcomes of these infections among the pregnant population, however, are not well described. Using retrospective data from a single institution, the present study sought to assess outcomes of pregnant women admitted with a dengue or malaria infection. Among the 85 patients included in the analysis, the majority were unemployed and had no antenatal booking. The cohort was relatively young with a median age of 28 years. Furthermore, more women had contracted dengue fever compared with malaria (56% vs. 21%). Of note, two fifths of the patients received a blood transfusion during admission; one quarter needed intensive care; and more than 14% required intubation. In addition, while patients with dengue became symptomatic and presented to the hospital at an earlier gestational age, patients with malarial infections were more likely to deliver low birth weight infants. Moreover, patients with multiple infections were more likely to deliver preterm and have higher WBC and ALT levels. In the current study one particularly alarming finding was the relatively high mortality rate of 7%. Collectively, these data demonstrate that women contracting dengue and/or malaria infections during pregnancy are at high risk of developing severe illness that can be fatal.",

For example, while Friedman et al. found that mothers with symptomatic dengue infections during pregnancy were more likely to deliver preterm and have low birth weight infants [12]; in a separate study, Tan et al. reported equivocal perinatal outcomes among women with and without dengue infection [24]. In the present study, we found that most dengue patients delivered at term, with an average gestational age of approximately 38 weeks. Furthermore, babies born to mothers infected with dengue were, on average, of normal birth weight (mean weight [g] = 2969, SD = 577). In addition, the finding of the present study that mothers infected with malaria were more likely to deliver low birth weight babies (mean weight [g] = 2394, SD = 840) is in accordance with that of previous investigators [25]. The mechanism through which malaria causes low birth weight is thought to be related to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) [25]. In fact, it is estimated that in certain parts of Africa, up to 70% of the risk of IUGR is attributable to malaria [26].",

In an ethnographic analysis, Mumtaz and Salway reported that women\u2019s subordinate position within the household, economic dependency, and the taboos surrounding pregnancy contribute to the reduced utilization of antenatal services [27]. Additionally, there is growing evidence that education level is closely tied to improved health. For example, higher levels of female education have shown to be correlated with increased utilization of antenatal care [27]. To this end, sustained efforts are needed at multiple levels for tackling low female enrolment in schools, as well as for providing safe, reliable, female-centric public transport services to address the sex-based disparities in healthcare provision.",

Alarmingly, the mortality rate of the present cohort was particularly high at 7% (n = 6). As such, previous studies have shown that pregnant women have a fourfold increased risk of developing severe dengue compared to non-pregnant women [29]. Indeed, previous authors have also noted the dengue case fatality rate to be higher among pregnant patients relative to the non-pregnant population [29]. In the current study, all the patients who experienced an in-hospital death had multiorgan involvement with all but one patient needing ICU admission. In contrast, in the overall cohort, one quarter of patients required ICU admission. In this context, the data in the current study are derived from a tertiary care center, and the high mortality rate should be interpreted with the caveat that patients at tertiary care hospitals are more likely to have severe disease. Of interest, in the current study the platelet levels were deranged below the lower end of normal with up to 40% of patients receiving a blood transfusion. The degree of thrombocytopenia among patients infected with dengue/malaria is an indicator of clinical severity and is thought to be due to platelet lysis by the complement cascade, platelet consumption secondary to disseminated intravascular coagulation, and disruption of the hematopoietic cells by the pathogens [30, 31]. Moreover, the diagnosis of dengue/malaria in pregnancy is made challenging due to similar symptomatology (such as thrombocytopenia, impaired liver function, and decreased urine output) as other pregnancy-related conditions such as pre-eclampsia. As such, physicians practicing in endemic regions should entertain a high index of suspicion to be able to differentiate between the two conditions and successfully manage patients [32].",

In addition, data collection spanning 5 years helped account for seasonal variation of disease incidence, as well as the annual variations in severity of dengue infections seen during outbreaks. The results of the present study, however, should be interpreted with several limitations in mind. First, this was a retrospective study and therefore subject to coding errors and selection biases. Moreover, the study analyzed data from a single institution, thereby limiting generalizability and preventing analysis of the geographical distribution of the malaria and dengue pathogens.
