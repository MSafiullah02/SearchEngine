Host manipulation is the process by which a pathogen evolves adaptations to manipulate the behavior of the host to maximize reproduction (R o ) of the pathogen. The most notable example is rabies. When a host is infected with the rabies virus it gets into the host's central nervous system and triggers hyper aggression. The virus is also present in the rabid animal's saliva so being bitten transmits the infection to a new host and the old host is left to eventually die if untreated. Toxoplasmosis is another example. When mice are infected they demonstrate a fearlessness toward cats, thus increasing their chances of being eaten.",

Recent studies have shown that exposure to toxoplasmosis in humans (e.g., through cat feces) has also been associated with behavioral changes that are predicted to enhance the spread of the pathogen. Even the common influenza virus has been shown to selectively increase in-person sociality during the 48-hour incubation period, thus producing an obvious vector for transmission. Here we hypothesize that the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, which produces the COVID-19 disease may produce similar host manipulations that maximize its transmission between humans.",

Survival is the most critical goal for different pathogens and parasites, especially concerning their chances of reproduction. Past research has shown that behavioral host manipulation can occur to promote the best interest of the pathogen [1, 2] . Host manipulation can be viewed as adaptations that commandeer the behavior and actions of the host in ways that promote the reproductive best interests of the virus. Benefits may result in increased chances of transmission and survival. Host manipulation has been recognized in a number of pathogens such as toxoplasmosis, rabies, and influenza [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] . It is important to mention that certain pathogens are neuro-invasive, and understanding how it targets and manipulates the central nervous system (CNS) can broaden possible questions about host manipulation [7, 8] .",

The best estimates are that children born to mothers infected with influenza have a 4 times greater risk of developing either schizophrenia or an affective disorder, with schizophrenia being more likely. This line of research is still preliminary and controversial. We will not be able to observe the effects of SARS-CoV2 on unborn children for some time, but the possibility that this virus manipulates fetuses for its own reproductive success is not out of the question. For example, fetal exposure could produce an early immunological response that results in a suppression of symptoms, but not the elimination of infection nor behavioral changes that could later promote reemergence. Thus, these individuals could be very powerful vectors for transmission in the future. This is of course conjecture, but not outside the realm of possibility.",

Signs of the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 mutating are already being observed [19] . There appears to be a larger divergence between the novel SARS-CoV2 virus and other known coronavirus'. Researchers also found that the virus has branched into at least two types, type L and type S, in which the S is portrayed as the ancestral version of the SARS-CoV-2. Type L is known to be more prevalent and more aggressive, which could lead to a quicker spread throughout the populations.",

Social isolation can fundamentally make people desire to be around others as well. The longer people are isolated, the more individuals will feel the need to interact with other people. It should also be considered that individuals with severe depression or suicidal tendencies may be at an increased risk of seeking social interaction as a means to execute their suicidal plan.",

This could seemingly be tested by examining spring break participation by those who test positive for COVID-19 or by looking at differences in viral status by comparing those who traveled somewhere vs. those who did not. There have been reports of young people holding so-called \"coronavirus parties\" of which at least one college-aged individual has become sick as a consequence. Some countries are making it illegal to purposefully congregate in a manner that would increase the odds of transmission. Making it illegal may actually promote these parties as young, already risky adults may blatantly ignore those laws. Obviously, these data are not ideal and have several confounds associated with them, but might provide initial insight into possible behavioral mechanisms at play.",
