            "text": "Globally, the number of people affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly increasing. In most (>80%), the illness is relatively mild and can be self-managed out of hospital. However, in about 20% the illness causes respiratory compromise severe enough to require hospital admission. [1] Patients with severe and critical disease need full active treatment. This may include oxygen for hypoxaemia and ventilatory support, along with optimal management of complications, e.g. super-imposed bacterial infection, and any underlying co-morbidities, e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure. To date, no antiviral agent has shown to be effective in treating the disease. [2] Patients with severe disease not considered suitable for escalation to intensive care, i.e. those who are frail or have multiple co-morbidities, are at very high risk of dying, with an estimated death rate of 15-22%. [3, 4] We have a moral obligation to provide good symptom control to prevent avoidable suffering. Thus, comprehensive care of the patient with COVID-19 requires identification of patients at increased risk of dying, who would benefit from a parallel approach to management. This encompasses optimal symptom management for those with severe disease but who will survive, and expert symptom management and end of life care for those that are deteriorating and in their last days-hours of life. The aim of this editorial is to provide a succinct informative overview to guide respiratory healthcare professionals on the frontline.",

The primary driver of breathlessness is the viral lung infection causing an interstitial pneumonia with a reduction in lung diffusing capacity; in some patients this evolves to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The experience of breathlessness is also influenced by emotional, environmental, cultural and social factors, and optimal management requires a holistic approach. These include non-pharmacological and pharmacological approaches. Non-pharmacological approaches include breathing techniques. [10] Although an electric hand-held fan directed at the face is helpful in other settings [10, 11] , this is not recommended in COVID-19 because of the theoretical infection control risk of spreading infected droplets. As an alternative, use of facial cooling with wet wipes (binning after each use, as for tissues) can be tried.",

            "text": "Pharmacological approaches are the mainstay of management for patients with severe disease who are likely to have rapidly worsening breathlessness at rest. Morphine is the opioid of choice. [12, 13] However, alternative strong opioids can be used. Short-acting oral opioids, given as required, may suffice when breathlessness is mild. However, in severe disease or at the end of life, continuous infusions of parenteral opioids are preferable, maximising symptom management whilst reducing nurse and community staff time, use of resource limited protective equipment and exposure. Use of the parenteral route is also preferred for speed of onset of action and ability to rapidly titrate doses. If there is distressing breathlessness at rest, opioids should be combined with an anxiolytic sedative, e.g. midazolam (Table 1) . Rapid titration of benzodiazepines may be needed. The primary role of oxygen is to correct hypoxaemia. There is a suggestion it may help breathlessness in severe hypoxaemia [14] , but not when mild or absent. [15] In a comatose/unresponsive dying patient, oxygen can be titrated down with goal of discontinuation, while concurrently managing symptoms of breathlessness. [16] Cough (70-80%) [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] : Potential mechanisms in viral respiratory infection and ARDS include inflammation, epithelial damage, mucus impaction and neuro-modulatory changes (heightened cough reflex sensitivity). [17] Evidence for effective management of acute cough is limited. [18, 19] Adequate hydration and regular small sips of water may help. [20] However, because of the likely concurrent need for breathlessness management, strong opioids are likely to be more pragmatic in practice. High-level evidence is limited [21, 22] , but relatively low doses of long-acting oral morphine (5-10mg twice daily) are helpful in refractory chronic cough (Table 1) . [21] Although these patients do not have chronic cough, opioids may be helpful in reducing cough alongside treatment for breathlessness. [22] Delirium: Delirium is common in medical illness and almost universal in the last days-hours of life. Non-pharmacological management includes regular orientation, avoiding constipation, treating pain, maintaining oxygenation and avoiding urinary retention. [23] When ineffective and where the delirium is causing significant distress, pharmacological therapy with an antipsychotic (such as haloperidol) should be considered; in the context of severe breathlessness and at the end of life, a sedative anxiolytic such as levomepromazine or midazolam should be used (See Table 1 ) to allow rapid titration if needed.",
