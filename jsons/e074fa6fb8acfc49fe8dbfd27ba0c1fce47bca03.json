Multiplex PCR panel assays were used to test CARVs in respiratory specimens. Findings: Twenty-nine out of 287 allo-HSCT recipients (10%) developed IFD after a CARV episode. The median time of IFD onset was 21 days (range, 0-158 days) from day of the first CARV detection. Generalized estimating equation model identified 4 risk factors for IFD: ATG-based conditioning regimen [odds ratio (OR) 2.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-5.2, P = .038], CARV lower respiratory tract disease (OR 10.6, 95% CI 3.7-30.8, P < .0001), CARV infection during the first year after transplant (OR 5.34, 95% CI 1.3-21.8, P = .014), and corticosteroids during CARV (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.1-6.3, P = .03). Conclusion: Allo-HSCT recipients conditioned with ATG and under corticosteroid therapy at the time of CARV LRTD during the first year after transplant may require close monitoring for subsequent IFD.",

Two-hundred and ninety-eight allo-HSCT recipients (91%) developed as a minimum of one episode of molecularly proven CARV with 633 CARV episodes (78%) overall. Thirty-six episodes (6%) were excluded since baseline disease relapse occurred before the CARV detection. Finally, 287 allo-HSCT recipients with 597 consecutive molecular-documented CARV infectious episodes met inclusion criteria. Clinical and transplant characteristics are detailed inTable 1.

Of note, this study was conducted in the setting of antifungal prophylaxis during the period at higher risk (first 3 months after transplant and/or while on corticosteroids therapy). This strategy is not universally applied worldwide.33 Thus, it is likely that the use of triazole prophylaxis may have reduced our IFD rate.The current study provides significant insights into RFs for CARV-related IFD in this particular scenario. Our first observation was that most IFD cases (92%) occurred during the first year after transplant, particularly in recipients with LRTD. This was an important observation, suggesting that prophylactic and diagnostic effort should be focused in this context. The current study confirmed that CARV LRTD was an independent RF for IFD, pointing to a direct",
