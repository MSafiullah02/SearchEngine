Later in the course of disease, and soon after ICU admission, severe renal failure with anuria needing renal replacement therapy developed. Lymphopenia was another common feature in our two patients, also noted in the report by Zaki and colleagues.3 Such a clinical presentation is reminiscent of that of patients with severe SARS, except that acute renal failure seemed less common in SARS cases. In fact, SARS-CoV was associated with a wide spectrum of clinical features\u2014infected people presented initially with fever, myalgia, chills, and rigor and subsequently developed pneumonia.14, 18 Notably, patient 1 had diarrhoea among initial symptoms, a feature not yet reported in patients with MERS-CoV, but present upon admission in a quarter of patients with SARS.19 Patient 1 died on May 28, and patient 2 remains in the ICU under ECMO. The case-fatality rate in patients infected with MERS-CoV is high\u2014it is estimated to be 50% in the 44 patients reported so far by WHO.8 This rate is higher than that of SARS, estimated at 15%, and strongly age-dependant.14 Whether this rate is higher for patients with MERS-CoV because of underreporting of milder forms of disease, a higher proportion of patients with underlying immunosuppressive disorders, as in our patients, or higher virulence of MERS-CoV compared with SARS-CoV has yet to be established.",

In the upper respiratory tract, the rate of viral shedding was initially low and increased to peak at around day 15.22 Whether MERS-CoV is present outside the respiratory tract will require additional studies. So far, there have been no reports of virus detection in stool or urine, and our preliminary data suggest that the virus might be present in blood. For SARS, the virus was readily detected in stool samples and more frequently after 10 days from onset of symptoms, whereas in blood samples detection was more frequent during the early course of illness.21 Although additional data for the kinetics and routes of viral shedding are needed for MERS-CoV, initial data suggest that for possible or suspect cases, especially when presenting early after the onset of symptoms, clinical samples from the lower respiratory tract should be obtained for confirmation of infection. Confirmation of an initially negative result on another sample taken a few days later should be recommended before exclusion of possible cases.",

            "text": "Patient 2 was admitted on April 26, at a time when pneumonia was already present in patient 1 and MERS-CoV was present in the bronchoalveolar lavage sample taken on the same day (although this result was not available at the time). For the next 3 days, the two patients shared the same room with no specific isolation measures other than standard precautions. 9\u201312 days after this exposure, patient 2 developed symptoms suggestive of lower respiratory tract infection (figure 3\n). In patient 2, infection with MERS-CoV was confirmed 2 days later on an induced sputum sample. This timeframe is at the high end of the 1\u20139 day incubation period reported in the two secondary cases from the UK10 and of the 2\u201310 day incubation period of SARS.23 In view of the very small number of patients for whom a well-defined window of exposure for MERS-CoV is available, this finding of human-to-human transmission through exposure during the upper range of reported incubation periods suggests that incubation periods beyond 10 days might be possible with MERS-CoV, with important implications for the duration of the quarantine needed to rule out infection in contacts. Furthermore, patient 2 had not recently travelled abroad, excluding any other source of contamination. However, the exact route of transmission from patient 1 to patient 2 remains unclear. Nosocomial transmission of MERS-CoV has been suspected in patients and health-care workers with respiratory symptoms in Jordan in April, 2012, and in an ongoing hospital outbreak with more than 20 cases in Saudi Arabia.24 Person-to-person transmission was further documented from one patient to two family members in the UK10 and for two cases reported in Tunisia.8 As for SARS-CoV, transmission through large respiratory droplets is currently thought to be the most likely route of MERS-CoV transmission between the two patients we describe. No aerosol-generating procedures were used with patient 1. The presence of diarrhoea in patient 1, possibly linked to MERS-CoV infection as previously described with SARS-CoV,25 might also have been a potential source of contamination of the environment. Systematic detection of MERS-CoV in stools of future patients might be important to document shedding of the virus through faeces and its potential contribution to viral transmission. During the hospital stay in Valenciennes, no personal protective equipment was used, and we did not record any secondary transmission in more than 100 health-care workers assessed for the development of symptoms or tested by RT-PCR for the presence of MERS-CoV (unpublished). Similarly, patient 2 was discharged from the hospital to his home and, up to now, no secondary cases have been detected in some 40 contacts. Low virus shedding in the upper respiratory tract might contribute to reduced transmissibility, although serological investigations will be needed to better assess the extent of transmission. The underlying disorder and immunosuppressive treatment of the two patients probably contributed to their increased susceptibility to the infection, and such background should be added to the list of criteria associated with increased suspicion of MERS-CoV infection. The risk that on acquisition of mutations MERS-CoV might become increasingly transmissible between human beings must also be kept in mind and continuously assessed as suggested.26\n",
