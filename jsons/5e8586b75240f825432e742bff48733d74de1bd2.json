They conclude that patients with severe conditions were more likely to require corticosteroids and that mortality rate was higher in patients who received glucocorticoid treatment. This study, however, has several limitations that prevent any conclusion about treatment recommendations. First, there is a lack in the literature of randomized trials on this topic. Thus, most of the included studies in the meta-analysis were retrospective cohort studies with biases and weaknesses. Second, there is a great heterogeneity between included studies with differences among design, therapeutic strategies and case-mix population, and this was also confirmed by the sensitivity analysis. And third, there are only 2 cohort studies focusing on SARS-CoV-2. Finally, this metaanalysis is unable to deliver strong evidence and powered information about beneficial or harmful effect of glucocorticoids in COVID-19 patients.",

Several questions regarding targets such as type of pulmonary lesion and severity of disease, and the best timing for corticosteroid use remain unanswered. Based on recent interim WHO guidance (4), some authors did not support corticosteroid treatment for SARS-CoV-2 lung injury (5), and glucocorticoids are rarely used in descriptive studies of critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU) (6, 7) . Interestingly, pathological findings in a deceased patient after acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to SARS-CoV-2 infection have been recently described (8) .
