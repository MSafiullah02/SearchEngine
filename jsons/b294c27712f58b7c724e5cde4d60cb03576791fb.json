The role of ubiquitin is to regulate fundamental cellular processes such as endocytosis, protein degradation, and immune signaling. Many viruses including influenza A virus (IAV) usurp ubiquitination and ubiquitin-like modifications to establish infection. In this focused review, we discuss how ubiquitin and unanchored ubiquitin regulate IAV host cell entry, and how histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), a cytoplasmic deacetylase with ubiquitin-binding activity, mediates IAV capsid uncoating. We also discuss the roles of ubiquitin in innate immunity and its implications in the IAV life cycle.",

Interferon (IFN)-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), a potent antiviral protein which inhibits IAV cytosolic entry [22, 23] , is downregulated by ubiquitination by E3 ubiquitin ligase neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated protein 4 (NEDD4), the depletion of which boosts cell resistance to IAV infection [24] . Tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) proteins, which belong to the RING family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, counteract IAV replication. For example, TRIM25 is a key mediator in antiviral retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) signaling [25] (described in Section 7). TRIM22 and TRIM32 ubiquitinate nucleoprotein (NP) and viral polymerase subunit PB1, respectively [26, 27] , targeting them for degradation. IAV proteins indirectly modulate ubiquitination events to evade immune responses and support virus replication. For example, nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) inhibits TRIM25 [28] .

The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs) mediate the sorting of ubiquitinated membrane proteins into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) [42, 43] .

The two catalytic domains CD1 and CD2 of HDAC6 form together an ellipsoid-shaped complex of pseudo-two-fold symmetry [65] . Between the two catalytic domains there is a polypeptide that binds to the dynein motor [66, 67] . Besides enzymatic activity, HDAC6 has an intrinsic ubiquitin-binding capability carried out by a zinc finger ubiquitin-binding domain (ZnF-UBP) close to the C-terminus (Figure 2 ), making it unique among HDAC family proteins [68] .",

Thus, HDAC6 ZnF-UBP only binds to free mono ubiquitin and unanchored ubiquitin chains ( Figure 2 ). Biochemical and structural analysis of the ZnF-UBP in complex with the full-length ubiquitin or the ubiquitin C-terminal RLRGG-peptide confirmed the necessity of the terminal diglycine for ZnF-UBP binding [63, 71] . When ubiquitin is anchored to a target polypeptide via the C-terminus, HDAC6 ZnF-UBP cannot bind to it.

Proteasomes do not degrade aggresomes but tend to congregate in their vicinity [12, 76] . A proteasome-associated K63-specific DUB called Poh1 is necessary for aggresome clearance because it produces unanchored K63-linked ubiquitin chains which activate HDAC6 [12] . Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a binding partner of HDAC6 [77] and contributes to aggresome clearance by stimulating Poh1 to produce unanchored ubiquitin chains [76] . Ubiquitin binding to HDAC6 regulates the repressive Hsp90-heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) complex, the dissociation of which leads to activation of HSF1 and expression of cellular chaperones [58] . In Poh1-deficient cells, aggresome clearance is inhibited but can be restored by microinjecting unanchored K63-linked ubiquitin [12] . Toxic protein aggregates are processed by autophagy after being sequestered to the MTOC, and HDAC6 regulates the formation of a cortactin-dependent F-actin network that is interspersed among such protein aggregates. This activity stimulates autophagosome-LY fusion and aggresome degradation [61] (Figure 3 ).",

Following viral fusion at LEs, these ubiquitin moieties are exposed to the cytoplasm and attract HDAC6 to the sites of fusion on the surface of LEs. HDAC6 in turn binds to the capsid, which during endocytic transit has been broken down into M1 dimers [81] , and links it to cytoskeleton motors dynein and myosin. This generates a shearing force that disassembles the capsid and releases the vRNPs into the cytoplasm (Figure 3 ). Point mutations H1094/H1098 or W1116 of the mouse HDAC6 ZnF-UBP inactivate ubiquitin binding to HDAC6 and block uncoating [66, 82] . By blocking HDAC6 binding to dynein, dynein and myosin activity, or by depolymerizing microtubules or actin, uncoating is diminished [66] . It is likely that DUBs assist in the process of IAV uncoating. This is because DUBs such as ataxin-3 [63] and Poh1 [12] that generate unanchored ubiquitin chains are required for HDAC6-mediated aggresome processing.",

To ensure proper assembly, viruses remove uncoating factors during the late stage of infection [30] . The IAV strategy is dually cunning; it not only inactivates HDAC6 but also induces a stable microtubule network that promotes viral progeny egress and budding. During replication, IAV cleaves off the HDAC6 ZnF-UBP by activating caspase 3 [83] , which prevents premature capsid uncoating. HDAC6 inactivation combined with virus replication increases acetylation of microtubules. Acetylation promotes the association of microtubules with kinesin-1 and dynein motors which regulate endosome trafficking [84] [85] [86] [87] . Cells lacking HDAC6 deliver EGFR prematurely to LE/LY compartments, resulting in faster EGFR degradation [88] . Hyperacetylated microtubules promote IAV genome egress via Rab11-positive recycling endosomes [89] [90] [91] [92] (Figure 4) . Although hyperacetylated microtubules appear to play no role in IAV uncoating [66] , we cannot exclude the possibility that kinesin, in addition to dynein and myosin, contributes to the uncoating process. . IAV uses HDAC6 differentially during entry and egress. IAV uses aggresome processing and unanchored ubiquitin chains in an HDAC6 ZnF-UBP-dependent manner to promote capsid uncoating during entry. During replication IAV induces ZnF-UBP cleavage by caspase 3 [83] which inactivates virus uncoating activity. Microtubules become hyperacetylated [59] and promote viral egress [90] . The red ubiquitin (Ub) depicts ubiquitin that is anchored, and the blue ubiquitin depicts unanchored ubiquitin with a free C-terminus.",

The incompatibility of avian IAV strains with the human host can be explained by the lack of factors supporting viral replication in human cells or the presence of restriction factors that cannot be counteracted by avian strains until adaptive mutations are selected [103] . It has been known for some time that in human cells, avian-derived IAV polymerase is poorly active. In heterokaryons formed between human and avian cells, the activity of avian IAV polymerase is restored [104] , and the responsible host factor co-opted in avian cells was recently identified as ANP32A [105] .",

It has been shown that duck TRIM25 can activate RIG-I CARD mutant lacking lysine residues by a mechanism independent of ubiquitination [106] . TRIM25 produces unanchored ubiquitin chains that activate RIG-I in vitro [13] , suggesting that interaction with unanchored ubiquitin might regulate duck RIG-I.

            "text": "RIG-I activates inflammasomes, the key components of the innate immune response to pathogens or tissue damage [107] . These large multiprotein complexes are formed rapidly in response to PAMPs and serve as scaffolds to activate caspase 1, which processes pro-interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18 into IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, respectively, which can then be secreted [95, 107] . Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor family member NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is involved in defense against infection with IAV and many other viruses including hepatitis C virus [107] [108] [109] [110] [111] . Ubiquitination and deubiquitination regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation. For example, breast cancer 1 (BRCA1)/breast cancer 2 (BRCA2)-containing complex subunit 3 (BRCC3) deubiquitinates NLRP3, and pharmaceutical inhibition of DUBs restricts inflammasome activation [79, 112, 113] , whereas E3 ubiquitin ligases LUBAC and TRIM33 promote inflammasome assembly [114, 115] . In bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) depleted of HDAC6, there is a significant boost in caspase 1 activation and IL-1\u03b2 secretion as a response to NLRP3 activation. HDAC6 ZnF-UBP interaction with NLRP3 inhibits inflammasome activation [79] , suggesting that unanchored ubiquitin regulates this pathway. NS1, the major suppressor of the IAV IFN response, antagonizes both TRIM25/Riplet-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination and NLRP3 inflammasome activation which underscores their significance in anti-viral immunity [28, 108, 116] .",

Among these are ubiquitin, cytoskeletal proteins, and tetraspanin cluster of differentiation (CD) 81 [118] [119] [120] . The biological significance of these non-viral proteins is largely unknown; encapsidated enzymes, for example, could play a regulatory role in IAV entry. In order to better understand how HDAC6 contributes to IAV uncoating, the following aspects should be addressed: (1) virion ubiquitin content (e.g., abundance of unanchored moieties and their linkages); (2) architecture of the viral fusion pore; and (3) availability of other uncoating factors in the cytoplasm.",
