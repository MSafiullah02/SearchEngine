The current standard of care for diagnosis of active infection is the detection of viral RNA from respiratory specimens by real-time, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). [[1], [2], [3], [4]] There are, however, a limited number of isothermal amplification methods that have been developed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. One such isothermal assay is the Atila iAMP COVID-19 detection kit, which targets the open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) region and nucleocapsid (N) gene in a single channel and utilizes the detection RNase P in a separate channel as the internal control. To evaluate this isothermal method, as well as two additional rRT-PCR assays, the N1 and N2 components of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assay and a commercial multiplex assay targeting the envelope (E) and spike (S) genes (Altona Diagnostics), we tested nasopharyngeal samples from individuals under investigation for COVID-19 using the Stanford Health Care (SHC) Clinical Virology Laboratory EUA assay as reference. Given the need to rapidly deploy SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, these data are important to inform laboratory decision-making and to guide clinical management.",

            "text": "These results highlight subtle differences in sensitivity, the relative importance of which may vary based on the patient population tested and how frequently low viral load specimens are expected. Slightly reduced sensitivity was observed in the Atila iAMP assay; five reference positive samples were not detected in the initial experiments and three were still not detected after re-extraction. Isothermal reverse transcription amplification methods are typically at least as analytically sensitive as rRT-PCR, so the explanation for this difference is not readily apparent. Furthermore, Atila requires the highest nucleic acid eluate input volume (18 \u00b5L) of these tests and utilizes common SARS-CoV-2 gene targets, though the details of the oligos used in the assay are not disclosed. However, this isothermal method yields results approximately 1 hour more rapidly than the rRT-PCR thermal cycling methods evaluated in this study. The decision to choose one assay over another in this setting should assess the balance between advantages in turnaround time and instrument or reagent availability, and the drawbacks of potentially reduced sensitivity. These include consideration of the underlying patient population being tested, as well as the possibly significant clinical and public health implications of missed COVID-19 cases.",
