            "text": "Classical swine fever virus (CSFV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), are currently the most important pathogens that have caused tremendous economic losses for swine industries worldwide. Under typical conditions of intensive swine production, it is ordinary for swine to be simultaneously infected with two or more viral pathogens (Hu et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2011). Multiple infections lead to atypical clinical signs. For instance, CSFV and PRRSV cause respiratory failure or abortions and/or stillbirths in pigs which can be easily confused (Lim et al., 2016; Young et al., 2010). Similarly, signs of the PEDV infection were clinically and pathologically indistinguishable from those caused by TGEV (Ducatelle et al., 1982; Haelterman, 1972). Usually, viral isolation based on cell culture is the standard laboratory methods for diagnosis of viral diseases (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988; Terpstra and Wensvoort, 1988), but is time consuming and complicated. When clinical signs can be variable and may not be pathogen-specific, a number of costly virus-specific tests are performed to diagnose accurately viral pathogens. Therefore, development of rapid and simultaneous detection assay for diagnosis of swine virus pathogens is important and urgent.",

The specific product was observed on amplification of CSFV, PRRSV, PEDV or TGEV and the amplicons exhibited the expected sizes with 116, 197, 435 and 720 bp, respectively, while no product was observed from negative control (Fig. 1\nA).

When different combinations of cDNA templates of three or four viruses were used in the optimized mRT-PCR reaction, the respective products were amplified and could be differentiated by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1B and C), suggesting that the mRT-PCR developed could be used for simultaneous detection of CSFV, PRRSV, PEDV and TGEV.",

Results from mRT-PCR assay were consistent with that of single RT-PCR. However, the specimens for virus infection or co-infections were positively detected by Taqman RT-qPCR but negatively by mRT-PCR (Table 2\n). Our results indicated that the mRT-PCR developed is a rapid and validated method for simultaneous detection of clinical specimens. Previous reports showed that co-infection of PRRSV/CSFV and procine teschovirus (PTV) (Liu et al., 2011) or PRRSV/CSFV and pseudorabies virus (PRV) (Hu et al., 2015) was detected by mRT-PCR in clinical specimens from commercial herds in China. In our experiments, five clinical specimens exhibited co-infection of PRRSV and CSFV and one specimen co-infected with PEDV and PRRSV based on mRT-PCR detection. No clinical specimens simultaneously containing three or four viruses were identified by mRT-PCR or Taqman RT-qPCR (Table 2).",

Diagnosis of virus infection is typically accomplished by viral isolation followed by immunostaining analysis and serological methods. However, viral isolation is complex, labor intensive and time-consuming. Serological methods have low specificity and/or sensitivity. Nucleic acid detection, particularly based on PCR/RT-PCR, has expanded exponentially in recent years. By simultaneously amplifying more than one target in the same reaction, multiplex PCR increasingly is used as a rapid and convenient assay in the clinical diagnosis (Henegariu et al., 1997; Hu et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2013). In this study, we developed a multiplex RT-PCR assay for simultaneously detecting four viral pathogens in clinical specimens. Compared to a single RT-PCR or RT-qPCR, mRT-PCR is a rapid, convenient and effective assay and is more advantageous to detect clinically mixed infection.",

Sensitivity of any PCR depends on multitude of factors including efficiency of the primer, reaction conditions and components (Elnifro et al., 2000; Reid et al., 1998). mRT-PCR contained multiple primer pairs in the same PCR reaction. Ideally, the primer pairs should enable similar amplification efficiencies for their respective targets and be not complementary for earh other, particularly at their 3\u2032 ends (Cha and Thilly, 1993; Dieffenbach et al., 1993; Henegariu et al., 1997). Here, we optimizedly designed specific primers with G + C content of 42\u201362% and nearly identical annealing temperatures (58\u201361 \u00b0C) for mRT-PCR (Table 1). Our results demonstrated that the amplified products in a single reaction could be easily differentiated on the basis of size and that no significant mispriming to any template or dimers occurred. Sensitivity of mRT-PCR is identical to a single RT-PCR for each virus or different combinations of two viruses. When three or four viruses existed in same reaction, sensitivity of mRT-PCR for PEDV detection decreased significantly compared to a single RT-PCR.",

The partial virus negative samples detected by mRT-PCR were virus positive by Taqman RT-qPCR assay, suggesting that mRT-PCR seems to be less sensitive than Taqman RT-qPCR. However, by adding multiple primer pairs to the same reaction system and amplifying multiple cDNA templates, the mRT-PCR can amplify multiple targeted genes at one time so as to achieve the simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens. The mRT-PCR assay has the additional benefits of using a smaller sample size and fewer reagents.
