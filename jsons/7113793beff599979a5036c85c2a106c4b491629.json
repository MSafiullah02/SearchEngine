Indeed, to date, there is satisfactory evidence that COVID-19 is mainly transmitted with close contact via respiratory droplets and fomites [2] . Especially, performing aerosol-generating surgical procedures, such as laparoscopy and endoscopy, presents increased infection risk for anesthesiologists, surgeons, and surgical staff attending in the operating room (OR).",

According to guidelines from Italy and China, two of the countries most affected by the pandemic, only emergency operations and elective cancer surgeries should be performed, although this strategy has faced opposition and criticism in other countries [4, 5] . Likewise, an Italian team suggested postponing all surgical procedures of patients suspected to have COVID-19 until confirmed infection clearance [6] . At this point, we should note that despite the fact that several cancer-related surgeries, such as biopsies, are elective, they are also considered essential and would thus not be prudent to postpone them.",
