Post-transplantation pulmonary complications and acute respiratory failure (ARF) contribute significantly to the morbidity and mortality from this procedure [1]. Although the incidence of ARF after HSCT has decreased over time, mortality remains high, particularly for patients who require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation [2]. Hence, a team approach between transplantation, intensive care, and ancillary services is essential to improve outcomes. This review will highlight an approach to ARF from this perspective, focus on identifying patients at risk for ARF before transplantation, update definitions of pulmonary complications, discuss newer insights into pathophysiology and novel therapeutic options, explore the role of brocho-alveolar lavage (BAL) in the context of newly developed infectious diagnostic arrays, and include post\u2013intensive care (ICU) rehabilitation.",

The diagnostic criteria of IPS have been updated based on an official American Thoracic Society Research Statement (Table 1\n) and classified into entities based on anatomical sites of inflammation as related either to interstitial, vascular and airway tissue, or unclassifiable (Table 2\n) [6]. Clinical symptoms include cough, dyspnea, and hypoxemia with or without fever. Chest radiography may show bilateral infiltrates. The incidence of IPS in the first 120 days after allogeneic HSCT with myeloablative conditioning is 3% to 15% 5, 7. Risk factors include total body irradiation, older recipient age, and acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) 3, 8, 9. The incidence of IPS is lower after nonmyeloablative conditioning; however, the clinical course resulting in ARF and death once the diagnosis was established is unchanged [8]. IPS-related mortality has been historically high (>50%) despite treatment with corticosteroids [7]. Noninfectious lung injury occasionally occurs after autologous HSCT [10].",

Translocation of lipopolysaccharide across a gut mucosa damaged in the early post-transplantation period stimulates the release of cytokines that contribute to lung damage and development of acute GVHD [14]. The lung is also sensitive to reactive oxygen species, whose production is enhanced in this setting [15]. Changes in exhaled nitric oxide, a marker of airway inflammation, are useful to guide risk stratification for noninfectious lung injury after lung transplantation [16]. Surfactant dysfunction caused by decreased synthesis in alveolar type II cells or degradation by oxidants likely contributes to IPS [17]. Transtracheal instillation of human surfactant protein-A attenuated the manifestations of IPS in mice [18]. Keratinocyte growth factor is a growth factor for type II pneumocytes in vivo. Keratinocyte growth factor increases lung surfactant levels, may detoxify reactive oxygen species, lowers serum TNF-\u03b1 levels, and diminishes lung injury in IPS mouse models [19].",

BiofireFilmArray Respiratory Panel (BioFire Diagnostics, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT, USA) targets 20 pathogens including 17 viruses and subtypes and 3 bacteria, and it is performed with minimal sample manipulation [32]. Although 33% of BAL specimens on HSCT patients between days 31 to 100 were positive for infection in a retrospective study performed from 2001 to 2007 [33], with improved diagnostic arrays, this yield may be higher. Procedural complications were noted in only 3.6% of cases, and only 2% of patients required intubation and mechanical ventilation within 48 hours after procedure. BAL data resulted in changes in medical management in approximately 60% of cases [33]. The diagnostic yield of BAL was as high as 75% when performed within 24 hours of clinical presentation [34]. Procedural complications occurred in only .6% of patients in this study. Pathogens detected in the lower respiratory tract with BAL often differ from those detected in the upper respiratory tract with a nasopharyngeal wash. In addition, assay for galactomannan in BAL has a 93% negative predictive value for diagnosing proven and probable invasive fungal infections (IFI) [35]. Further, institution of corticosteroid therapy for IPS may cause more harm than benefit in the context of an undiagnosed infection. The risks associated with empiric antimicrobial therapy, including medication side effects and development of resistance, compound the potential harm of delaying targeted management.",

Children with noninfectious and infectious pulmonary complications after transplantation had a significantly lower forced expiratory flow at 25% to 75% of vital capacity on pretransplantation PFT [47]. Lower FEV1, FVC, and RLD predicted worse overall survival [47]. Reduced pretransplantation FEV1 and FVC were associated with higher risk of early respiratory failure [48]. A worse lung function score, a combined measurement of FEV1 and single-breath diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide was associated with poor survival [49]. These patients may benefit from non TBI-based conditioning, lung shielding, prevention of GVHD, and close monitoring of PFT after transplantation. Patients receiving myeloablative conditioning had much greater declines in FEV1 compared with those receiving nonmyeloablative conditioning, with a higher mortality risk, especially if the pretransplantation FEV1 was less than 60% [50]. For patients with combined ventilation/diffusing capacity deficits before transplantation, reduction in lung TBI dose improved survival [51]. Further, for patients with abnormal pretransplantation lung function and others with evolving pulmonary dysfunction after transplantation, our approach is to conduct weekly multidisciplinary rounds in conjunction with the intensive care team to discuss strategies to prevent further respiratory compromise.",

Etanercept (Enbrel; Immunex, Seattle, WA) is a dimeric protein consisting of 2 soluble p75 TNF receptors fused to the Fc portion of a type I IgG1 molecule. Significant improvements in day 28 survival were reported in several single-institutional, nonrandomized studies combining etanercept with corticosteroids 52, 53, 54. A randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of etanercept for treatment of IPS after allogeneic HSCT in adults was halted because of accrual of only 34 subjects and precluded a definitive conclusion [55]. Etanercept administration was not associated with increased toxicity, increased incidence of opportunistic infections, or risk of relapse compared with placebo controls [55]. A multicenter phase II trial of etanercept with corticosteroids in children with IPS accrued 28 evaluable patients. Complete responses were seen in 20 (71%) patients, with a median time to response of 10 days. Response rates were higher in patients not requiring mechanical ventilation at study entry and overall survival at 1 year after therapy was 63%, comparing favorably with historical data [56]. Early recognition of the disorder, BAL to exclude infectious pathogens, and therapy with etanercept and corticosteroids may improve outcome after IPS.",

In some instances, it helps avoid endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation. It is of particular interest in patients who are highly susceptible to infections because it does not breach the respiratory barrier. In a recent survey that explored the variation in the care of critically ill pediatric HSCT patients in North America, all 33 centers included in the study reported the use of bontinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) before intubation [76]. A success rate (defined as the absence of subsequent endotracheal intubation) as high as 74.2% in 239 immune-compromised children has been reported [77]. Cardiovascular dysfunction was 1 of the predictive factors for NIPPV failure [77]. In a postallogeneic HSCT adult cohort, the early initiation of noninvasive ventilation was associated with better oxygenation but did not improve survival or need for mechanical ventilation [78]. The benefit from the NIPPV is usually seen early within few hours of its application. Therefore, evolving pulmonary dysfunction in patients at risk (Figure 1\n) should prompt escalation of therapy to the use of invasive mechanical ventilation.",

A common theme that is particularly true of post-transplantation patients with respiratory failure who require mechanical ventilation is the clear and early derecruitment of distal alveolar air space available for effective gas exchange. The pathophysiology of IPS involves loss of alveolar air space as a critical element leading to hypoxemia. Efforts aimed at minimizing alveolar derecruitment include judicious use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) with low tidal volume (TV) strategies (6 mL/kg). Likewise, goals of ventilation may need to be moderated toward maintaining pH > 7.25 and supporting oxygen saturation to >85%. A landmark study from the ARDS Network evaluated higher versus lower TV mechanical ventilation and demonstrated a reduction in mortality from 40% to 31% with 6 mL/kg ideal body weight TV, compared to 12 mL/kg ideal body weight TV [80]. To achieve optimal lung protection, the lowest plateau pressure and TV possible should be selected. Accumulating observational evidence suggests that TV should be limited in all mechanically ventilated patients\u2014even in those who do not have ARDS. PEEP should be set to maximize alveolar recruitment while avoiding over-distention. Judicious use of higher PEEP may be needed in clinical settings of DAH or engraftment syndrome.",

Thus, high-frequency oscillation theoretically meets the goals of a strategy of lung protective ventilation with extremely small TV (1 to 4 mL/kg) and constant lung recruitment. The benefit of HFOV in treatment of ARDS is still controversial. In patients with ARDS, HFOV reduced hospital and 30-day mortality and resulted in improved oxygenation, as measured by the partial arterial oxygen saturation/inspired oxygen fraction (PaO2/FiO2) ratio [82]. However, a recent multicenter, randomized controlled trial of HFOV versus conventional mechanical ventilation in 548 adult patients with ARDS concluded that mortality was actually higher in patients receiving early HFOV [83]. Pediatric literature is also inconclusive, but many centers reported improved gas exchange with the use of HFOV [84]. Therefore, the use of HFOV may still be suitable as a rescue treatment in patients with refractory hypoxemia, when higher mean airway pressures or FiO2 are required to maintain oxygenation.",

Although earlier studies failed to show survival benefit, recent evidence suggests that interval prone positioning in patients with severe ARDS can reduce mortality. In a recent multicenter randomized trial, 474 adult patients with severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 <150) were randomized either to standard supine or interval prone positioning with protective mechanical ventilation strategies implemented in both groups. Mortality was significantly lower in patients undergoing interval prone positioning compared with that for patients in supine position (24% versus 41%, P < .001) [85]. Although prone positioning may offer benefits in treating children with ARDS, it has to be done cautiously as it is associated with increased frequency of adverse events, such as airway obstruction, hypotension, vomiting, and accidental extubation [86].",

            "text": "Recently, the ARDS Network Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial reported that a conservative fluid management strategy, compared with a liberal fluid strategy, increased the mean number of ventilator-free days in adult patients with acute lung injury (15 versus 12 days respectively, P < .001) [87]. In addition to this beneficial effect on outcomes, the study found that the conservative fluid strategy did not increase the incidence of renal failure or the development of shock. There is growing evidence that fluid overload in critically ill children is associated with worse outcome. In a large series of 297 critically ill children receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), children with fluid overload \u226520% had a higher adjusted mortality rate of 8.5 compared with those with <20% [88]. There was a 3% increase in mortality for each 1% increase in fluid overload at CRRT initiation. Children after transplantation are at higher risk of fluid overload. In addition, in many instances, they manifest capillary leak that renders fluid management more challenging. In a retrospective review of 26 children after transplantation children with acute renal failure and fluid overload, <10% fluid overload was associated with better survival [89]. Early initiation of CRRT for treatment of fluid overload when diuretic therapy fails may help to improve oxygenation and outcome. In a retrospective review in our institution that included 30 post-transplantation pediatric patients with acute lung injury who underwent CRRT from 1994 to 2006, CRRT was associated with significant improvement of oxygenation 24 and 48 hours after initiation of this therapy. PaO2/FiO2 increased significantly with median increase of 31 and 43 in the 24- and 48-hour intervals after initiation of CRRT compared with the 24-hour interval before CRRT. This improvement in PaO2/FiO2 was associated with the reduction of fluid balance after initiation of CRRT [90]. In a cohort of 51 pediatric stem cell recipients (both autologous and allogeneic) on CRRT, survivors had lower mean airway pressure at the end of CRRT compared to nonsurvivors receiving mechanical ventilation [91]. This suggests that the etiology of underlying pulmonary dysfunction may influence the beneficial effects of CRRT.",

Cardio-pulmonary exercise testing may be performed if indicated. Overnight pulse-oximetry may be considered to assess need for supplemental oxygen during sleep, as hypoxia may go unnoticed and lead to pulmonary hypertension. Development of pulmonary hypertension has been associated with BOS in lung transplant recipients [110]. Transthoracic echocardiography is an excellent screening tool for pulmonary hypertension. Seasonal influenza vaccine and protective pneumococcal titers may be beneficial, as respiratory viral infections are not uncommon late after allogeneic HSCT [111]. Physical therapy to build cardiorespiratory endurance and avoidance of active or passive smoking is important. Repair of impaired pulmonary function with recovery of diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide was observed 10 years after allogeneic HSCT [112].",
