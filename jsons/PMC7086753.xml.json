The astrovirus genome has three open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1a encodes the non-structural polyprotein 1a, while the longer ORF1b encodes polyprotein 1ab, which includes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that is expressed through a ribosomal frameshift at the ORF1a/1b junction. ORF2 encodes the viral capsid structural polyprotein [9].",

Astroviruses have been reported to cause gastroenteritis in humans and some mammals; however, avian strains have been linked with both intestinal and extraintestinal manifestations [7, 9]. In humans, 8 classical human astrovirus types are known (HAstV1-8); however, novel and diverse groups of human astroviruses have been found recently [3, 8]. Porcine astrovirus was first identified by EM in 1980 [1] and isolated in 1990 [16], and the capsid region (ORF2) was characterized genetically in 2001 [7]. So far, only three porcine astrovirus capsid (ORF2) sequences have been published: two complete capsid sequences from the same source from Japan [7] and one partial capsid sequence from the Czech Republic in 2006 [5].",

The original aim of the study was to detect porcine calicivirus (norovirus and sapovirus) in domestic pigs [13] by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using the generic primer-pairs p289/p290 [6] designed for the calicivirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (319-nt for norovirus and 331-nt for sapovirus). RNA isolation and RT-PCR were performed as described previously [10]. For the determination of the 3\u2032-end nucleotide sequence of the novel porcine astrovirus by RT-PCR, sequence-specific oligonucleotides were designed on the basis of the conserved regions of reference human and animal astrovirus strains, and the currently available overlapping porcine astrovirus nucleotide sequences (long-range PCR and primer-walking strategy). Fecal samples were also screened for novel porcine astrovirus using sequence-specific primers (pAstV-F, 5\u2032-TGACATTTTGTGGATTTACAGTT and pAstV-R, 5\u2032-CACCCAGGGCTGACCA) amplifying a 799-nt-long ORF1b/ORF2 region at 45\u00b0C annealing temperature. PCR products were sequenced directly using a BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) with the PCR primers and run on an automated sequencer (ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer, Applied Biosystems, Stafford, USA). Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using MEGA version 4.0 [17]. The 3,625-nucleotide-long ORF1b/ORF2/3\u2032UTR sequence of porcine astrovirus type 2 (PAstV-2) strain Hungary/2007 was submitted to GenBank under accession number GU562296.",

The putative ORF2 consisted of 2,556 nt (851 aa). The nt and amino acid (aa) distances based on the partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (ORF1b), N-terminal and complete capsid (ORF2) regions between porcine astrovirus strain Hungary/2007 and the reference astroviruses are shown in Table 1. In the RdRp region (ORF1b), a high degree of nt/aa identity (58\u201361/61\u201362%) was found with classical human astroviruses, with highest similarity to HAstV-3 (AF141381). There was no porcine astrovirus RdRp sequence available in the GenBank database for comparison. The characteristic YGDD RdRp motif was encoded by ORF1b. The highly conserved consensus ORF1ab/ORF2 junction and astrovirus promoter sequence UUUGGAGNGGNGGACCNAAN4\u20138\nAUGNC initiating ORF2 (where the ORF2 AUG start codon is underlined; N stands for any of the four nucleotides) are unique in porcine astrovirus strain Hungary/2007: just before the AUG start codon, this region includes 11 nucleotides (N11) GCATAAGCCTA (compete sequence motif: UUUGGAGGGGCGGACCAAAN11\nAUGGC) as the longest known sequence motif among astroviruses. The N-terminal half of the ORF2, with multiple basic Arg (R) residues, was found to be related (33\u201348% in nt) to other astroviruses, with the highest identity to HAstV-4 (DQ070852). However, the C-terminal half is very different. In the complete ORF2, the highest aa identities (18\u201319%) were found with porcine, classical human and MLB1 astroviruses. A conserved stem-loop structure that is predicted at the 3\u2032 end of the genomic RNA of members of several astrovirus species was not found in porcine astrovirus strain Hungary/2007, which also has the shortest (23 nt) 3\u2032UTR reported to date for an astrovirus.\n",

In this study, we detected a potential member of a new species of porcine astrovirus (PAstV-2), indicating that genetically different lineages of astroviruses exist not only in humans but also in piglets. In addition, this is the first report of the nucleotide sequence of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene of any porcine astrovirus. The generic calicivirus primers p289/p290, designed for the calicivirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase region, allowed a porcine astrovirus RdRp sequence to be amplified by RT-PCR. Comparison of primer p289 and the new astrovirus sequence indicates that there is an 11-base-pair-long region of identity between the astrovirus sequence and the 3\u2032-end of the primer sequence. Reverse primer p289, which was designed for the calicivirus (noro- and sapovirus)-conserved RdRp amino acid motif YGDD, recognized the same motif that is also present in astroviruses. Interestingly, porcine kobuvirus was first identified in the same set of fecal specimens [11, 12].",

This motif was not recognized in PAstV-2, and it is also absent in turkey astrovirus 2, human astrovirus MLB1 and bat astrovirus AFCD337 [2, 3]. This means that astrovirus screening and typing primers designed for this region [15] are not able to detect these viruses by RT-PCR. Interestingly, ORF2 aa 763\u2013840 of PAstV-2 has 52% positive sequence identity to members of the DnaB-like family of DNA helicases. Its unique sequence characteristics (ORF1b/ORF2 junction, 3\u2032UTR) and phylogenetic position indicate that PAstV-2 might be an important link to other astroviruses.",
