Its nucleocapsid is spirally symmetric with a core of nonsegmented single-stranded negative RNA. Its genome has a length of 16 kb, sequentially arranged with 6 genes, N, P, M, F, HA, and L from the 3\u2032 end to respectively encode six structural or functional proteins. They are nucleoprotein (NP), phosphoprotein (P), membrane protein (M), fusion protein (F), hemagglutinin (HA), and RNA-dependent large polymerase (L). Two types of spikes, HA and hemolysin (HL), are on the envelope but with no neuraminidase. As glycoproteins, HA and HL are able to stimulate body to produce protective neutralizing antibody. HA can participate in the virus absorption to bind to viral receptors on the surface of host cells, therefore, triggering the infection. HL is hematolytic to integrate infected cells into multinucleated giant cells.",

Skin rash is caused by swelling, proliferation, and exudation of vascular endothelial cells at the superfi cial skin as well as infi ltration, congestion, and swelling of dermal lymphocytes. All these changes can be attributed to viral or immune injury. The lesions of Koplik's spots at the oral mucosa are pathologically similar to those of skin rashes. The respiratory tract is subject to infl ammatory responses at the trachea and bronchus, interstitial pneumonia, and possibly cytomegalovirus pneumonia. Infi ltration of monocytes and Warthin-Finkeldey cells can be observed at the lesion. The mucosa at the intestinal tract is subject to similar lesions to the respiratory tract mucosa. In severe cases, the organs such as the liver, heart, and kidney are subject to hydropic and fatty degeneration of the cells. The patients with measles encephalitis may sustain cerebral and spinal congestion and swelling, scattering hemorrhage lesions, perivascular hemorrhage, infi ltration of lymphocytes, and even demyelination ( Fig. 23.1 ). Measles is commonly complicated by bacterial infection to cause severe acute bronchopneumonia, lung abscess, pleurisy, suppurative thromboangiitis, and formation of thrombus, thus resulting in severe pulmonary insuffi ciency. In addition, general viremia and/or septicemia can induce multiple organ responses, such as the lung and spleen as well as suppression of lymphatic tissues. The consequent seriously compromised immunity contributes to occurrence of death.",

The disease has an acute or subacute onset with a short illness course, with occurrence of death in several weeks to several months after the onset. Experimental studies have demonstrated that measles virus might mutate in the human body with compromised immunity. They achieve higher affi nity to the central nervous system and cause pathological changes in nervous tissues. By autopsy, the brain commonly appears normal, with diffusive pathological changes at the brain and spinal cord. Inclusion bodies can be found at the cytoplasm and nucleus of neurocytes as well as in the astrocytes. A large quantity of neurocytes is subject to degeneration and microglia, and astrocytes are subject to large quantities of proliferation. The hippocampal pyramidal layer is subject to severe hypoxia. But the white matter remains normal. Occasionally, infi ltration of monocytes around the meninges and blood vessels can be observed.

However, sporadic cases or community-based outbreaks in adults tend to increase in recent years due to missed vaccination or invalid vaccination, mostly with measles viral pneumonia or bacterial pneumonia secondary to measles. Pulmonary infections in the cases of measles are mainly primary measles viral pneumonia, and measles can cause pulmonary lesions via two routes: the fi rst route is via direct infection of measles virus and the other is secondary bacterial or other pathogenic infections. Only 3-4 % of the cases of measles pneumonia are primary, which is known as simplex measles viral pneumonia. Most other cases are secondary. According to literature reports, Haemophilus and Neisseria meningitidis are the most common pathogens. Jia CY et al. reported 163 cases of measles in adults. They found that only 3-4 % of the cases sustain pneumonia, in agreement to the previous fi ndings, accounting for 1.7 % of the cases infected by measles virus during the same period. And the severe cases account for 6.1 % of infected adults in the same period. In addition, secondary bacterial infection and complications might occur in most patients.",

In children, measles pneumonia often occurs when immune defense fails to fi ght against the invasion. However, in adults, measles pneumonia often occurs in pregnant women and patients with compromised immunity, such as patients receiving the treatment for hepatopathies and organ transplantation, patients with HIV/AIDS, and patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment. Qaisar reported that the incidence rate of complications of measles is closely related to the nutrition of the pediatric patients, indicating certain relationship between measles pneumonia and the immunity. Histological studies indicated that in the cases with no complications, the patients with simplex measles virus pneumonia are demonstrated with proliferation of alveolar epithelium and extensive alveolar lesions. The epithelial proliferation is related to the alveolar squamous metaplasia around the bronchioles and bronchi. Cystic dilatation of bronchial mucous gland can be observed, which is characterized by multinucleated giant cells at the alveolar, bronchiolar, and bronchial epithelium. The imaging demonstrations of measles pneumonia resemble to those of other viral pneumonia. Simplex measles virus pneumonia might be demonstrated as reticular nodular shadow, consolidation of the air cavity, and sometimes enlarged hilar lymph nodes in children. CT scanning demonstrates ground-glass opacity, consolidation of the air cavity, and nodules at the center of lobule. The concurrent interstitial and parenchymal lesions indicate the pathological basis of extensive damages to the alveoli. In rare cases, pleural effusion can be observed. Complications may be demonstrated as corresponding lesions, such as pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema, and pulmonary edema.",

The shadows can be groundglass opacity or might progress into alveolar consolidation shadow. In rare cases, a small quantity of pleural effusion can be observed. In the cases of adenovirus pneumonia, the diseased lung lobules integrate to each other, leading to formation of pseudo lung lobes. In the cases of severe pneumonia with heart failure and pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) might occur, especially in the cases complicated by myocarditis. ARDE is typically characterized by diffuse alveolar consolidation shadow at the lungs. In the early stage, X-ray demonstrates no abnormality or small fl akes of blurry shadows. But with rapid progress of the conditions, the small fl akes of shadows develop into multiple fl akes of integrated shadows or large fl akes of consolidation shadows like ground-glass opacity.

In terms of the illness course and the histopathology, immunosuppressive measles encephalitis is different from cerebromeningitis and subacute sclerotic panencephalitis following acute infection. For children, measles is often moderate or mild, possibly with no skin rash. However, they experience lethargy and consciousness disturbance, which progressively develop into coma, with localized or generalized spasm, slight hemiplegia, myoclonus, and blindness. 2. CT scanning demonstrates multiple patches of lowdensity shadows at the basal ganglia and the interface of gray and white matters. Contrast scanning demonstrates no enhancement or slightly abnormal enhancement. 3. MR imaging demonstrates multiple fl akes of high T2WI and FLAIR signals, with poorly defi ned boundaries.
