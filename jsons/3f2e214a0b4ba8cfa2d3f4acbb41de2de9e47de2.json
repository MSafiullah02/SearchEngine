Although light-weight agile software development approaches are favored by software development service providers, additional requirements elicitation practices should be incorporated when scaling factors apply, since design team members need to have a shared understanding of the operating context and highlevel requirements. Research indicated that the organization construction diagram (OCD) could be useful to create a shared context for enterprise operation, linking detailed functional requirements to this shared context during software development. Although the OCD is concise, its associated concepts are abstract and an additional story-card method (SCM) is needed to transform existing enterprise implementations into an OCD. Since additional evaluation of the SCM was required, this study focused on a real-world demonstration of the SCM at a Fintech company where an agile software development approach is applied. The results indicate that the SCM is useful when incorporated within an agile software development approach.",

Figure 1 indicates that the benefits department was the scope-of-interest. Furthermore, multiple actor roles may be involved (indicated as rectangles), acting as an initiator (when linked to a solid line) or an executor (when linked to a solid line that ends in a filled diamond). Actor roles interact with one another via several transaction kinds (TKs). Figure 1 includes two TKs, namely T01 (claim evaluation) and T02 (claim payment). The diamond-disc representation of the TK indicates that every TK consists of a production act/fact (represented by a diamond) and multiple coordination acts/facts (represented by a disc). The actor roles are either classified as elementary or composite. An elementary actor role (indicated by a white rectangle) is the executor of only one TK, as exemplified by the evaluator in Fig. 1 . A composite actor role, indicated by a grey-shaded rectangle, is the executor of more than one TK. By default, actor roles that are outside the scope-of-interest, are modelled as composite actor roles [6] . Therefore, Fig. 1 indicates that the broker and finance department are composite actor roles. The actor role within the scope-of-interest (i.e. the evaluator) may need to have access to production facts and coordination facts that are produced outside the scope-of-interest. Figure 1 indicates that the evaluator needs information access (indicated with a dotted line) to an in-house software system facts, i.e. production and coordination facts that are produced outside the scope-of-interest.",
