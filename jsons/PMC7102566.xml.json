            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus, a gammacoronavirus belonging to the family Coronaviridae, is a large, enveloped, positive-strand-RNA virus, approximately 27.6 kb in size (Boursnell et al., 1987). The IBV genome encodes 4 structural proteins: the spike (S) and membrane (M) glycoproteins, nucleocapsid (N) phosphoprotein, and envelop (E) protein. It also encodes at least 4 accessory genes\u20143a, 3b, 5a, and 5b\u2014which occupy one-third of the genome at the 3\u2032 end. The S glycoprotein, an integral membrane protein, is posttranslationally cleaved into the N-terminal S1 and C-terminal S2 subunits (Cavanagh, 2007). The S1 subunit is responsible for selection of the host, induction of protective immunity, and neutralization of most neutralizing serotype-specific antibodies (Kant et al., 1992, Wickramasinghe et al., 2011). Because the S1 subunit of spike protein shows greater sequence diversity than other regions of IBV genome, it is most commonly used for molecular characterization, genetic classification, and genotyping of IBV. Such efforts have recently helped differentiate IBV strains worldwide into 7 IBV genotypes, 35 lineages, and a number of interlineage recombinants (Valastro et al., 2016, Chen et al., 2017, Jiang et al., 2017, Ma et al., 2019). However, new IBV genotypes and variants are frequently emerging in different parts of the world, and many factors are contributing to this emergence and evolution (Sjaak de Wit et al., 2011, Jackwood, 2012). In addition, the IBV genome contains 2 overlapping open reading frames (ORF), which occupy two-thirds of the genome and encode polyproteins 1a (pp1a) and 1 ab (pp1ab). These polyproteins undergo autoproteolytic cleavage to produce 15 nonstructural proteins (nsp2\u2013nsp16).",

Regions of the genome predicted to have a stable secondary structure have been reported to be recombination \u201chot spots\u201d in coronaviruses (Nagy and Simon, 1997). Recombination events in the coronavirus genome are believed to have promoted the emergence of viruses with novel traits such as altered tissue tropism, antigenicity, and pathogenicity. Some of these novel viruses are even able to adapt to new hosts and ecological niches, sometimes causing zoonotic events. This has been observed in the case of a turkey coronavirus which was proved to have evolved after simultaneous infection of a host with a known IBV strain and an uncharacterized coronavirus, resulting in recombination in the S1 subunit of spike gene and a subsequent shift in host tropism from chickens to turkeys (Jackwood et al., 2010). In case of IBV, many recombinants isolated in different parts of the world have shown novel traits relative to those of their predicted parental viruses (Sjaak de Wit et al., 2011, Jackwood, 2012).",

The chicken flocks in these 2 farms were from the same layer breeders and had been vaccinated under similar IB vaccination programs. Chicken in both farms showed signs of the disease at approximately 20 D of age. It was, therefore, speculated that these 2 disease outbreaks were caused by similar agents and that IB vaccine strains were likely involved in the disease, although morbidity and mortality rates varied between the 2 farms. In this study, IBVs were isolated from both chicken flocks. However, isolate LLN/111169 was found to be genetically and antigenically identical to the Conn vaccine-like strain, and isolate LJL/110302 was genetically and antigenically different from isolate LLN/111169, and the 3 vaccine strains H120, Conn, and 4/91, which implied that different IBV lineages/serotypes were involved in the 2 farms.",

            "text": "The GI-19 lineage generally has a higher prevalence in China (Xu et al., 2018), and previous epidemiologic investigations had established that LJL/110302 (GI-19)-associated infections had previously occurred on the same farm and in the vicinity. This virus lineage was involved again in the latest disease outbreak. In the present report, it was demonstrated that isolate LLN/111169 is a chimeric virus possessing an LJL/110302-like (GI-19) genome sequence, but with a unique S gene sequence which showed high similarity to that of the Conn vaccine strain and a 4/91-like (GI-13) fragment containing about a half-length of the N gene sequence at the 3\u2032 end and a complete 3\u2032 UTR. This chimeric virus was probably generated by multiple recombination events between the Conn and 4/91 vaccine strains and the circulating LJL/110302-like field strain. It is believed that recombination events can occur and can sometimes be observed in cases where birds have been vaccinated or infected with a mixture of IBV serotypes/lineages. In the present case, infection of GI-19-lineage IBVs in Conn-vaccinated and/or 4/91-vaccinated birds was possible because vaccination with the 2 vaccine strains could not provide complete protection against the GI-19 lineage (Liu et al., 2014, Han et al., 2017). Thus, mixed infection of vaccine and virulent strains might occur under such conditions, which is the premise for the occurrence of recombination events. On the basis of this phenomenon\u2014as observed in other IBV strains previously isolated in China\u2014the Conn-like and 4/91-like sequences found in the genome of isolate LLN/111169 can be assumed to have been derived from the Conn and 4/91 vaccine strains (Liu et al., 2014, Han et al., 2017).",

            "text": "Recombination is a common phenomenon in coronaviruses. It has been found to be responsible for the emergence of SARS-CoV (Ge et al., 2013, Hu et al., 2015, Lau et al., 2015) as well as new strains of other coronaviruses, including human CoV HKU1, human CoV OC43, feline CoV type II strains (Herrewegh et al., 1998, Woo et al., 2006, Lau et al., 2011), and deltacoronaviruses (Lau et al., 2018). Recombination involving the S protein is believed to be a common phenomenon that might generate new genotypes and facilitate interspecies transmission and adaptation to new animal hosts. In avian coronaviruses, recombination events involving the S protein are believed to have promoted the emergence of turkey (Jackwood et al., 2010, Mardani et al., 2010) and guineafowl (Brown et al., 2016) coronaviruses; in this case, the turkey coronavirus was proved to have evolved after simultaneous infection of a host with a known IBV strain and an uncharacterized coronavirus, resulting in recombination in the S1 subunit of spike gene and a subsequent shift in host tropism from chickens to turkeys (Jackwood et al., 2010). Infectious bronchitis virus is among the most important coronaviruses responsible for heavy economic losses worldwide. Recombination events in the S protein of IBV can not only result in the emergence of novel genotypes/serotypes and variants but also potentially result in the loss of vaccine efficacy, because the S protein plays an important role in antigenicity, tissue tropism, and virulence (Wickramasinghe et al., 2014). Vaccine efficacy could also be reduced by antigenic differences among vaccine and field strains due to mutations in the S protein and incorrect vaccine choice. In the present study, although the recombinant LLN/111169 strain had the backbone of a GI-19-like virus, it was highly similar in its S protein sequence to the Conn vaccine strain and was antigenically related to the Conn vaccine strain. However, the LLN/111169 was isolated from a commercial layer flock that were vaccinated the Mass\u2013Conn bivalent vaccine. It was possibly that other factors such as the improper use of vaccine were involved in the loss of vaccine efficacy although it was required to be confirmed by vaccination-challenge test in the further investigation. However, isolate LLN/111169 was less pathogenic to SPF chickens than isolate LJL/110302, although both isolates showed broader tissue tropism. Interestingly, LJL/110302 and LLN/111169 showed different replication patterns in the tissues of SPF chickens, with the more virulent LJL/110302 isolate showing a greater replication capacity than the LLN/111169 isolate in the earlier stages of infection and lower replication capacity at 8 dpi. This difference in replication patterns might be associated with the recombination events in the N gene and 3\u2032 UTR of isolate LLN/111169 (Tsai et al., 2018, Lo et al., 2019).",

However, strain LLN/111169 have emerged from multiple recombination events of the vaccines used, including Conn and 4/91 and another G1-19 field strain. It seems unlikely that all those recombination events have occurred simultaneously during a production cycle. It is more possible that those multiple recombination events have occurred over multiple flocks, and strain LLN/111169 emerged after the recombination of previous intermedial recombinants; the exact recombination schemes between the predicted parental viruses that produced the recombinant LLN/111169 strain remain unknown. Therefore, the present results should be interpreted with caution, and further investigations are necessary to advance our understanding of the mechanisms involved in recombination events in IBVs. Currently, IBV prevention is mainly dependent on vaccination with modified live vaccines. The identification of recombination events between field and vaccines strains, resulting in novel IBV strains with altered features, raises significant concerns over the use of IB vaccines in chicken flocks. In addition, the findings of this study highlight the significance of constant epidemiologic and molecular surveillance for IBV.",
