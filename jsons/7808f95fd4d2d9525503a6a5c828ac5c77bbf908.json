In this paper, we propose a method of Correlation aware unsupervised Anomaly detection via Deep Gaussian Mixture Model (CADGMM), which captures the complex correlation among data points for high-quality low-dimensional representation learning. More specifically, the relations among data samples are correlated firstly in forms of a graph structure, in which, the node denotes the sample and the edge denotes the correlation between two samples from the feature space. Then, a dual-encoder that consists of a graph encoder and a feature encoder, is employed to encode both the feature and correlation information of samples into the low-dimensional latent space jointly, followed by a decoder for data reconstruction. Finally, a separate estimation network as a Gaussian Mixture Model is utilized to estimate the density of the learned latent vector, and the anomalies can be detected by measuring the energy of the samples. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

            "text": "Unsupervised anomaly detection aims to detect outliers without labeled data for the scenario that only a small number of labeled anomalous data combined with plenty of unlabeled data are available, which is common in real-world applications. Existing methods for unsupervised anomaly detection can be divided into three categories: reconstruction based methods, clustering based methods, and one-class classification based methods. Reconstruction based methods, such as PCA [5] based approaches [10, 18] and autoencoder based approaches [20] [21] [22] [23] , assume that outliers cannot be effectively reconstructed from the compressed low-dimensional projections. Clustering based methods [6, 17] aim at density estimation of data points and usually adopt a two-step strategy [3] that performs dimensionality reduction firstly and then clustering. Different from previously mentioned categories, one-class classification based methods [1, 7, 11] make the effort to learn a discriminative boundary between the normal and abnormal instances. Although the above-mentioned methods had their fair share of success in anomaly detection, most of these methods neglect the complex correlation among data samples. As shown in Fig. 1 , the conventional methods attempt to conduct feature learning on the original observed feature space of data samples, while the correlation among similar samples is ignored, which can be exploited during feature learning by propagating more representative features from the neighbors to generate high-quality embedding for anomaly detection. However, modeling correlation among samples is far different from those conventional feature learning models, in which highly non-linear structure needs to be captured. Therefore, how to effectively incorporate both the original feature and relation structure of samples into an integrated feature learning framework for anomaly detection is still an open problem.",

Generally, we expect the values of these evaluation metrics as big as possible. The sample with high energy is classified as abnormal and the threshold is determined based on the ratio of anomalies in the dataset. Following the settings in [21, 23] , the training and test sets are split by 1:1 and only normal samples are used for training the model. The experimental results shown in Table 3 demonstrate that the proposed CADGMM significantly outperforms all baselines in various datasets. The performance of CADGMM is much higher than traditional anomaly detection methods such as OC-SVM and IF, because of the limited capability of feature learning or the curse of dimensionality. Moreover, CADGMM also significantly outperforms all other deep learning based methods such as DSEBM, DAGMM, AnoGAN, and ALAD, which demonstrates that additional correlation among data samples facilitates the feature learning for anomaly detection. For small datasets such as Arrhythmia, we can find that traditional methods such as IF are competitive compared with conventional deep learning based method such as DSEBM, DAGMM, AnoGAN, and ALAD, which might because that the lack of sufficient training data could have resulted in poorer performance of the data hungry deep learning based methods, while CADGMM is capable of leveraging more data power given the limited data source, by considering the correlation among data samples.
