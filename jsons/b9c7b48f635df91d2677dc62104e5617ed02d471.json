Mononucleosis is more common in young adults SEASON-tick-borne diseases are more common in spring and summer. Coxsackie virus and echovirus are more common in summer and fall. Meningococcus and parvovirus are more common in winter and spring GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION-Lyme disease in Pacific northwest, the Midwest, and the northeast USA and some southern Canadian locations. RMSF in south-central and Atlantic states. Ehrlichiosis in midwestern, south-central, and southeastern states. Tularemia in western, southeastern, and south-central states and Canada. Relapsing fever (Borrelia hermsii) in mountainous areas of the western USA.

These signs and symptoms have not been examined in combination. Laboratory testing has limited utility. In endemic areas, the combination of history of a tick bite, a solitary lesion of appropriate size, morphology and presence of systemic symptoms is consistent with erythema migrans.

            "text": "RATIONAL CLINICAL EXAMINATION SERIES: DOES THIS PATIENT HAVE INFLUENZA? APPROACH-''clinical findings identify patients with influenza-like illness but are not particularly useful for confirming or excluding the diagnosis of influenza. Clinicians should use timely epidemiologic data to ascertain if influenza is circulating in their communities, then either treat patients with influenza-like illness empirically or obtain a rapid influenza test to assist with management decisions''JAMA2005293:8 BASIC LABS-CBCD, lytes, urea, Cr, AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin, urinalysis MICROBIOLOGY-nasopharyngeal swab for rapid assays (variable sensitivity/specificity), RT-PCR (preferred), or DFA (Direct Fluorescent Antigen detection). Blood C&S, sputum Gram stain/AFB/ C&S, urine C&S IMAGING-CXR SPECIAL LUMBAR PUNCTURE-if neurologic symptoms ABG PREVENTION IS KEY-annual vaccination for the following individuals: 50 or older, children 6-24 months or taking long-term salicylates, any chronic medical condition, pregnant women, healthcare workers, household contacts of those at risk, and residents of chronic care facilities. In some jurisdictions, universal vaccination for influenza is recommended. Depending on the match between vaccine and circulating virus, the efficacy can range from 70 to 90% for a good match and 0 to 50% for poor matches TREATMENT-neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir 75 mg PO BID \u00c25 days, or zanamivir 10 mg inhaled BID \u00c25 days) are active against influenza A and B. Antiviral treatment is most effective when started within 48 h of symptom onset. Treatment decreases the duration of symptoms by 1 day, reduces viral shedding, and may reduce complications in those at risk. Inhaled zanamivir is relatively contraindicated in patients with asthma or chronic respiratory conditions. Household contacts of infected individuals should be vaccinated and may be given prophylaxis with oseltamivir 75 mg PO daily or zanamivir 10 mg inhaled daily \u00c210 days. Resistance to oseltamivir is a problem in some strains of influenza A, and amantadine or rimantidine may have a role. Treatment of pneumonia with antibiotics TREATMENT ISSUES NEURAMINIDASE INHIBITORS-neuraminidase plays an important role for viral release from the host cell. Oral oseltamivir and inhaled zanamivir are active against both influenza A and influenza B ADAMANTANES-block replication of influenza A RNA through inhibition of M2 protein ion channels. Amantadine and rimantadine are inactive against influenza B and C and resistance is now widspread in influenza A VACCINE PRODUCTION-every February/March, the World Health Organization makes recommendations regarding the three strains (two A and one B) of influenza viruses that are most likely to cause outbreaks in the fall/winter in the upcoming season. Vaccines are then produced based on this decision Rimantadine 100 mg PO BID ++ Zanamivir 10 mg INH q12-24h Neuraminidase Inhibitors. Block release of influenza virus from infected cells ++ ++ Oseltamivir 75 mg PO daily-BID ++ ++ CLASSIFICATION-fungal infections can be classified into three main categories: yeasts, molds (''filamentous fungi''), and dimorphic fungi YEASTS-grow as single cells (via budding) and include Candida, Malassezia, Rodotorula, Trichosporon MOLDS-these filamentous fungi grow as hyphae (via sexual and asexual reproduction) and include Aspergillus, zygomycetes, Fusarium, and dematiaceous (pigmented) fungi. Ubiquitous in the environment (e.g. soil, decaying vegetation, water, air). Infection may cause blood vessel invasion, thrombosis, and obstruction. Clinical syndromes include cerebral parenchymal infections, pulmonary parenchymal infections, hepatosplenic abscesses, and otitis externa DIMORPHIC FUNGI-exist as both molds and yeasts and include Coccidioides, Histoplasma, Blastomyces, and Cryptococcus. At low temperatures, found as multicellular molds (which release spores that are inhaled). In warm temperatures (e.g. inside the body), inhaled spores germinate into yeasts, which are infectious to the patient, but no longer contagious (i.e. these patients do not require isolation) PATHOPHYSIOLOGY-Candida albicans (''Germ-tube positive' ' with pseudohyphae) or non-albicans species (' 'Germ-tube negative,'' e.g. C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. krusei), mostly in patients with hematological malignancy, neutropenia, on immunosuppressants, IDU, or those in the intensive care unit with hemodialysis, broad-spectrum antibiotics, surgery, central venous catheters, and parenteral nutrition CLINICAL FEATURES-localized mucocutaneous infections (thrush and vaginitis), serious focal infections (endophthalmitis, meningitis, osteomyelitis), or disseminated infection (candidemia) with pustular skin lesions, retinal lesions. Candiduria is common in ICU patients, but represents colonization only unless patient is symptomatic TREATMENTS OROPHARYNGEAL-clotrimazole troche 10 mg 5\u00c2 daily, nystatin suspension (500,000 U) or nystatin pastilles (200,000 U) 4\u00c2 daily, fluconazole 100 mg PO/IV daily \u00c21-2 weeks ESOPHAGITIS-fluconazole 200 mg PO/IV daily \u00c22-3 weeks CANDIDURIA-remove catheter, indications for treatment include kidney transplant recipients, prior to cystoscopy or invasive GU procedure, neonates, severe illness, and possibly neutropenia (controversial). Fluconazole 200 mg PO/IV daily \u00c22 weeks ACUTE DISSEMINATED CANDIDEMIA-remove all intravascular devices. Fluconazole 800 mg then 400 mg PO/IV daily \u00c22 weeks (minimum), or one of the echinocandins, including caspofungin 70 mg then 50 mg IV daily, micafungin 100 mg IV daily, or anidulafungin 200 mg then 100 mg IV daily \u00c22 weeks (minimum) after last positive culture for C. albicans. Echinocandin and lipid formulation of amphotericin B are preferred for initial therapy in neutropenic patients. Almost all (>95%) C. albicans are sensitive to fluconazole. Some laboratories report C. albicans as ''C. albicans complex'' because of structural resemblance between albicans and dubliniensis. This is of no clinical significance because albicans and dubliniensis have same susceptibility patterns. Susceptibility patterns for other non-albicans infections may significantly differ. Consider echinocandin for non-albicans CID 2009 48:5 MICROBIOLOGY-genus contains >185 species including A. fumigatus (80% of clinical infections), A. flavus, A. niger, and A. terreus PATHOPHYSIOLOGY-mostly in patients with neutropenia, organ or stem cell transplants, advanced AIDS, or on corticosteroids. Invasive aspergillosis has mortality of >50% CLINICAL FEATURES-spectrum of pulmonary involvement includes colonization, pulmonary aspergilloma (''fungal ball''), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), chronic necrotizing aspergillus pneumonia (CNPA), and invasive aspergillosis. Second most common cause of fungal endocarditis (after Candida). Cutaneous involvement may follow trauma or dissemination from respiratory tract DIAGNOSIS-often difficult and may require biopsy with culture and histology. Check quantitative immunoglobulin, aspergillus IgG and IgE, galactomannan levels (suggestive of invasive aspergillosis). CT chest may show multiple nodular lesions (halo sign=nodule with surrounding hemorrhage, aircrescent sign=necrosis and cavitation). Sputum fungal culture and eosinophils, bronchoalveolar lavage, or lung biopsy TREATMENTS-voriconazole 6 mg/kg q12h \u00c224 h then 4 mg/kg IV q12h or 200 mg PO BID until resolved. Alternatives include caspofungin 70 mg then 50 mg IV ASPERGILLOSIS (CONT'D) q24h, lipid-formulation amphotericin B 3-5 mg/kg IV daily, micafungin 100-150 mg IV daily, posaconazole 200 mg PO QID then 400 mg BID after clinical stabilization. Some species, especially A. terreus, are resistant to amphotericin. Aspergillus is the only filamentous fungus that can be treated with echinocandins CID 2008 46:3 MICROBIOLOGY-large group of filamentous fungi including Rhizopus, Absidia, Rhizomucor, Mucor, and Cunninghamella PATHOPHYSIOLOGY-mostly affecting immunocompromised patients and those with diabetes. Prognosis extremely poor CLINICAL FEATURES-CNS, pulmonary, GI, and cutaneous involvement. Infection can cause devastating rhino-orbital-cerebral and pulmonary infections TREATMENTS-antifungal therapy frequently needs to be combined with surgical debridement. Empiric treatment options include lipid formulations of amphotericin B and pozaconazole. Note that susceptibility testing of Zygomycetes is not always reliable, and that caspofungin and ''azoles'' (apart from pozaconazole) are not generally effective HISTOPLASMOSIS PATHOPHYSIOLOGY-H. capsulatum endemic along St. Lawrence seaway and in Midwestern states located along the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys. Symptoms typically occur in patients who are immunocompromised or exposed to a large inoculum CLINICAL FEATURES-usually asymptomatic. Pulmonary manifestations may mimic sarcoidosis and include pneumonia (localized or diffuse), granuloma/cavitary lung lesions, and hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Pericarditis, arthritis, arthralgia and erythema nodosum may also occur without pulmonary symptoms. Disseminated disease may present with hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, oropharyngeal ulcers, skin, and CNS involvement DIAGNOSIS-fungal culture of blood and tissue, urine antigen, Histoplasma serology, and histopathology. Histoplasma is predominantly an intracellular pathogen; therefore cultures need to be placed in ''isolator tube'' (containing cell lysis product) TREATMENTS-itraconazole 200 mg PO TID \u00c23 days, then 200 mg PO daily-BID, lipid formulation of amphotericin B (preferred for ill patients) CID 2007 45:7",
