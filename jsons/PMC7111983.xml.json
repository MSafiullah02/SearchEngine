Mastadenovirus has been identified in mammals, including human, sea lion, canine, bovine, porcine, murine and bat (Aggarwal and Mittal, 2000, Goldstein et al., 2011, Klempa et al., 2009, Kov\u00e1cs et al., 2004, Li et al., 2010, Morrison et al., 1997, Rusvai et al., 2000). Aviadenovirus contains falcon and other fowl adenoviruses (Davison et al., 2000). Atadenovirus has been found in snake, marsupial and ruminants (Dan et al., 1998, Farkas et al., 2008, Thomson et al., 2002). Siadenovirus has been detected in frog, raptor and turkey (Beach et al., 2009, Davison and Harrach, 2002, Davison et al., 2000, Kov\u00e1cs and Benk\u00f6, 2009). A new genus, Ichtadenovirus, has been identified recently in fish (Benk\u00f6 et al., 2005).",

Other members of the genus Siadenovirus include THEV (Beach et al., 2009), RAdV-1 (Kov\u00e1cs and Benk\u00f6, 2011) and great tit adenovirus (GTAdV) (Kov\u00e1cs et al., 2010), all from avian hosts, as well as frog adenovirus 1 (FrAdV-1) (Davison et al., 2000), originating from an amphibian host. At first, we assumed that SPSAdV would belong to the Aviadenovirus genus because the South Polar skua is an Antarctic bird. However, phylogenetic analysis revealed that SPSAdV was similar to RAdV-1 and THEV (Pitcovski et al., 1998). Comparison between SPSAdV and its closest relatives (RAdV-1 and THEV) showed 21\u201343% and 25\u201352% nucleotide dissimilarity at the pol, penton base, hexon and fiber genes, and 15\u201356% and 25\u201371% amino acid difference, respectively. Also, the nucleotide sequences of the pol, penton base, hexon and fiber genes of SPSAdV, compared with FrAdV-1, showed 34\u201353% dissimilarity. Interestingly, although birds serve as host species of aviadenoviruses (Jiang et al., 1999, Oaks et al., 2005, Schrenzel et al., 2005), Aviadenovirus encodes more distinct proteins than Siadenovirus (Benk\u00f6 et al., 2000). The G + C content of the SPSAdV (34.2%) is similar with that of the other three siadenoviruses (RAdV-1: 38.5%, TAdV-3: 34.9%, FrAdV-1: 37.9%). The pVII gene of SPSAdV also shows significantly higher G + C content (46.9%). The G + C content does not vary across the genome in a systematic fashion, and this may suggest that a recombination event between disparate viruses did not occur.",

Based on these criteria, we conclude that SPSAdV represents a novel adenovirus species in the genus Siadenovirus. Recently, the entire genome of RAdV-1 was obtained by PCR without virus isolation (Kov\u00e1cs and Benk\u00f6, 2011). Thus, apart from THEV, RAdV-1 and FrAdV-1, this is only the fourth complete viral genome sequence in the genus Siadenovirus. Partial siadenovirus genomes have also been reported from the great tit (Kov\u00e1cs et al., 2010), budgerigar (Katoh et al., 2009), psittacine (Wellehan et al., 2009) and Sulawesi tortoise (Rivera et al., 2009). Siadenovirus from different avian, reptilian and amphibian host species share the same genome organization (Kov\u00e1cs and Benk\u00f6, 2009), suggesting that the evolutionary history may have involved host-switching events (Davison et al., 2003, Kov\u00e1cs and Benk\u00f6, 2009).",

It is well known that THEV infection is occasionally lethal and is characterized by depression, diarrhea, splenomegaly (Beach et al., 2009). Because of the close phylogenetic relationship between THEV and SPSAdV, we speculate that certain disease manifestations may be shared. That six of nine dead South Polar skuas had evidence of SPSAdV genomic sequences, as determined by PCR in one or more organs (heart, lung, liver, kidney, intestine and/or trachea), suggests systemic or disseminated infection, presumably with viremia and clinically significant disease outcome. SPSAdV infection in the South Polar skua may indicate acquisition and spread of infection as a result of stress from migration. Future studies are warranted to ascertain the biology, epizootiology and pathogenic potential of this newfound polar-region siadenovirus.",
