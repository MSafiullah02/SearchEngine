How are these decisions-that affect each and every one of us, some groups disproportionately and regardless of Covid-19 status-made? How far have policy makers and politicians consulted those who have experience and expertise on the secondary effects of lockdowns, social isolation measures and movement restrictions? We attempted to address these questions with a rapid analysis of 24 countries' Covid-19 task force compositions. The countries were selected to represent a range of geographies and income levels. As far as possible, we focused on governance bodies set up or activated to give scientific, or evidence-based, advice to national decision makers. In some countries, the advisory and decision-making bodies were one and the same, often taking the form of government-only interministerial committees. We excluded committees which were established to focus on a specific area, for example, research related to vaccination; rather, we examined committees whose explicit mandate (based on available information) was to provide advisory guidance on the overall national response.",

We then researched the task force members' backgrounds and triangulated from different sources to classify them based on their current professional role or area of specialisation. Experts were thus categorised based on the principal reason for their appointment to the task force. For example, a physician with a current public health role would be classified as a public health specialist and not a clinician, the assumption being that their current role is most relevant for the task force. The 'government' or 'Ministry of Health' category was allocated to career civil servants, that is, posts which are usually filled by generalists rather than specialists. Most other task force members, including public health institute staff, were categorised according to their expertise since the rationale for their task force membership is their specific skill set BMJ Global Health (mathematical modeller, virologist, etc) rather than their institutional affiliation.",

Now more than ever, the voices of those who are at risk of getting left behind need to be heard. 27 In the end, we must ensure that we do not do more harm than good with the measures in place to protect our at-risk populations.",
