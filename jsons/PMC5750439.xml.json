By the nature of their training and focus, scientists and the media tend to focus exclusively on the biological effects of such infectious diseases and rarely stop to examine the psychic havoc these epidemics leave in their wake. We will present an overview of the status of mental health in the context of epidemics and discuss the primary and secondary psychiatric conditions of emerging epidemics, including fiscal perspectives of the minimal resources for mental health issues in epidemics. Both of these points illustrate the hidden plight of mental health crises during epidemics and highlight crucial components of the need for comprehensive medical and mental health evaluations by physicians in an emergency setting.",

For instance, Borna virus, found globally among several warm-blooded hosts, has some human associations with neuropsychiatric disease.[34] In fact, certain bacterial agents have been shown to increase the risk of mental illness as well. Risk of obsessive-compulsive disorders and Tourette syndrome may be elevated in children with Group B streptococcal infection.[5] This is known as pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections. Pediatric psychiatric illnesses show an increased predominance with human B-cell antigen D8/17, the marker for elevated risk of poststreptococcal rheumatic heart disease.[45] Lyme disease, by Borrelia species through ticks, can be associated with verbal and memory loss and confusion.[46] Depression, dementia, and psychosis, and other postinfection psychiatric symptoms are reported in most parasitic infections, including leptospirosis.[47] And finally, neurocysticercosis can be linked with seizures and epilepsy.[4] These psychiatric manifestations of well-known infections demonstrate the importance of evaluating beyond the medical component. However, even without direct damage to neurons or cerebral tissue by bacteria, viruses, rickettsiae, or prions themselves, infectious diseases can have profound impact on the human psyche. This impact extends not only to the afflicted but also to health-care workers and family members who have taken care of them.",

Human transmission starts when a new host comes in contact with body fluids of a patient with active symptoms or who has died from EVD.[8] Symptoms include the following: abrupt onset of fever, chills, low-grade fever, malaise, diffuse erythematous, nonpruritic maculopapular rash developing 5\u20137 days postinfection, gastrointestinal, hemorrhagic, neurological, ocular, and other nonspecific symptoms.[8] As of June 2016, the last transmission of EVD from 2013 to 2016 West Africa epidemic occurred 42 days prior, which is equal to two cycles of the viral incubation period.[9] Over the course of the epidemic, health professionals reported that mental health services were overwhelmed due to loss of life, grief, and extreme anxiety experienced by patients, family members, and health-care professionals.[10]",

First, suicides related to EVD are most likely underreported, potentially due to societal factors or stigmas and medical record data reporting system weaknesses in countries plagued by EVD. Studies may be limited due to epidemiological and pathology factors of EVD (e.g., high mortality rate, disease onset, incidence rate, etc.). One notable study is from 1995, where 60 survivors from an EVD outbreak in Kikwit were interviewed and risk factors for social isolation were illustrated as a result, which increased the risk of suicide and other mental health conditions.[11] During convalescence, approximately one-third of participants reported feeling rejected by their social support networks (family, friends, and neighbors); approximately one-half had no income; and two out of five participants felt grief for family members who did not survive the disease. All participants reported strengthened relationships with religion due to surviving EVD. Interestingly, according to the CDC, risk factors for suicide include local epidemics of suicide, isolation, loss, physical illness, and barriers to accessing mental health treatment; protective factors include family and community support and religious beliefs that discourage suicide.[33] These emergency mental health needs call for the fiscal support for the use of social workers, community leaders, community health workers, and religious partners (e.g., hospital pastoral care professionals) as culturally appropriate case management resources to combat the tide of mental illness for a convalescing country through building in-country community resilience.",

In many cases, these two categories of disease and diseases within these categories are competing against each other for fiscal funding. The WHO places mental health in its noncommunicable disease category, and spending diverted to infectious diseases by the WHO weakens its already underfunded mental health programs.[3435] While there are additional health system strengthening and development avenues to improve mental health in areas after an epidemic, funding is insufficient. Collecting data is critical to making evidence-based funding and programmatic decision-making. Epidemiological data should be obtained to describe mental health issues that arise concomitantly with any epidemic and monitor the impact of mental health programs. New global health-care workforce with the training to address mental health issues during or after an epidemic has no new resources.[35] Thus, vital mental health services cannot be conducted without major sustainable resources committed by the global community in addition to its integration in epidemic response protocols.",
