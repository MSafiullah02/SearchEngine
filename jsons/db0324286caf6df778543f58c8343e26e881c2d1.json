In one sample parvovirus sequences were detected. These consensus sequences were 250 and 127 nt long and were represented by 24 and 2 sequence reads, respectively.

Hungarian BtBV sequences were highly similar to those viruses detected previously from bats in China (unpublished data, GenBank accession numbers: KC154061 and KC154060), which therefore are also related to bufavirus sequences. Although the Hungarian viruses were closely related to bufaviruses, they formed a separate monophyletic branch ( Fig. 2B and C) . Phylogeny revealed that bat-related bufaviruses might have had common unknown ancestors with bufaviruses identified from humans so far. In a recent publication, a novel parvovirus (WUHARV) was described in nonhuman primates, which were most closely related to bufavirus 2 genotype (Handley et al., 2012) . Based on recombination analyses (Fig. 3) , an intragenic recombination event was detected in the viral protein segment, which assumes that this nonhuman primate bufavirus might be a result of past recombination event between bat and human bufaviruses. Viral metagenomic analyses of M. schreibersii bats provide the first sequence data of bat parvoviruses from Europe with phylogenetic relatedness to the recently described human-infecting bufaviruses. The discovery of this novel BtBV along with the detailed molecular and recombination analyses expands our knowledge on the evolutionary history of bufaviruses and widens the list of human infecting viruses with possible bat origin. The shared evolutionary history between primate and bat bufaviruses seems to be interesting; however, the zoonotic transmission potential and the possible health risk posed by the newly described virus remains to be determined. High mutation rate and ability to recombination may facilitate fast evolution of bufaviruses, which might be quaint enough for investigate with further molecular characterization of both human and animal related bufavirus genomes.
