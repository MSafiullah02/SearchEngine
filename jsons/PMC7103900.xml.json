T lymphocytes are the main target cells in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) due to COVID-19, triggering cytokine storm with subsequent exhaustion of immune response [2, 3]. Importantly, there is no association between the viral load and severity of the disease [4]. The cascade of the disease pathways is reminiscent of systemic immune disturbances, particularly those in severe rheumatic flare. Based on the current knowledge of COVID-19 pathophysiology and clinical manifestations, the rationale for searching specific antivirals along with immune-modulating drugs is justifiable. A quick search through the US National Library of Medicine Clinical Trials registry (https://clinicaltrials.gov/) and the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (https://www.chictr.org.cn) may help retrieve links to studies of anti-rheumatic drugs in COVID-19. Ongoing research brings about hope for developing evidence-based anti-rheumatic therapies for the viral disease.",

For decades, these drugs have been used for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. The justification for their use in COVID-19 is largely based on the knowledge of their intracellular action [7]. These antimalarial drugs may disrupt the virus replication and subsequent cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 [8, 9]. CQ has proved efficient against the virus in COVID-19 pneumonia in Chinese clinical trials, justifying the inclusion of the drug in the Guidelines for the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by COVID-19 [10]. An open-label non-randomized clinical trial by Gauret et al. showed that HCQ reduces viral load in most COVID-19 patients and that its efficacy is enhanced in combination with azithromycin [11]. HCQ low costs and relative safety profile may secure its place in the strategy against COVID-19 [12].",
