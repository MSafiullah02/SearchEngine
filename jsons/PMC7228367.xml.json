The rapid spread of epidemic generated fear leading China authorities to restrict people movement to and from Wuhan in China, where the first start of epidemic was reported.

Moreover, Ser can act as a nucleophile in determined structural environments, such as those of enzyme active sites.

In this case, it may be speculated that due to the steric bulge and stiffness of the proline, the molecular structure of the COVID\u20102019 may undergo a local conformation perturbation compared with the proteins of the other two viruses. In Nsp3, the mutation falls near the protein similar to a phosphatase present also in the SARS coronavirus (PDB code 2acf) playing a key\u2010role in the replication process of the virus in infected cells\n17\n (Figure 3).
