            "text": "The well-known criticality hypothesis suggests that biological systems operate at the borderline between the sustained active and the sustained inactive state. This has been observed in various processes such as gene expression [1], cell growth [2], and neuronal avalanches [3]. In different contexts, the critical point enables optimal transmission and storage of information [4,5], maximal sensitivity to stimuli [6], and optimal computational capabilities [7]. Empirical studies on brain networks [8\u201310], however, exhibit a stretched critical region. The Griffiths phase, characterized by generic power laws over a broad region in the parameter space, provides an alternative mechanism for critical behavior in brain networks without fine tuning [11,12]. It is confirmed numerically and analytically that the structural heterogeneity induces the Griffiths phase, which eventually enhances the self-organization mechanism of brain networks.",

The essential characteristic of previous network models is the hierarchical level-dependent intermodule wiring probabilities. It is conjectured that plain modular networks are not able to support the Griffiths phase, and disorder in different scales significantly influences the properties of critical behaviors [11].

In this work, the hierarchical models are designed based on one such example with a finite topological dimension, the 3-regular Hanoi network [16,18,22,23]. To tune the modular feature that is present in brain networks, a single node of the original network is modified into a fully connected clique with a varying size. By introducing different classes of intermodule connections, the essential heterogeneous connectivity pattern is explored to induce the Griffiths phase on finite-dimensional networks. It turns out that the hierarchical level-dependent intermodule wiring probabilities play an important role, affecting the properties of the phase transition at criticality.",

A localized principal eigenvector of the network adjacency matrix indicates the network heterogeneity, which has been used to quantify the localization of activity on networks above the critical propagation rate in the dynamical model [24]. This concept has been applied to analytically explain the emergence of rare regions and the Griffiths phase [11,12,25]. However, the observation that a localized principal eigenvector is not necessarily the fingerprint of the Griffiths phase has been reported in highly connected networks with intrinsic weight disorder or finite-size random networks with power-law degree distributions [12,26]. As an extension to finite-dimensional models, a class of networks is found here where the Griffiths phase is absent although their principal eigenvectors are localized. As the second approach of the spectral analysis of the network connectivity matrix, the Lifschitz tails in the spectral density of the Laplacian matrix is proposed to predict the Griffiths phase analytically. Lifshitz tails have been related to the Griffiths singularity in equilibrium systems [27]. For synchronization and spreading dynamics on networks, simulation and quenched mean-field (QMF) approximation indicate a connection between the Lifshitz tail and the slow dynamics [11,28,29]. In this study, the tail distribution of the Laplacian eigenvalues is presented to test how well it predicts the Griffiths phase in the SIS model.",

In the first paradigm, the single edge in the original HN3 is now formed by two randomly chosen nodes in different cliques, which I denote HMN1. The second paradigm is inspired by previous hierarchical modular models [11,12]. To distinguish it from HMN1, I denote it HMN2. Previous models share common features, hierarchical construction of modules and level-dependent wiring probabilities. Modules are grouped to form larger modules on the next level.

In HMN2, for the first hierarchy, modules on this level are cliques themselves.

This suggests that the principal eigenvectors for HMN1 configurations are localized. Additionally, localized eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues are also found, shown in Fig. 2(b). For HMN2, I focus on level-dependent intermodule wiring probabilities, pi=4\u2212i+1 and pi=4\u2212i, in this work. The backbone as well as the first-level intermodule wiring probability is fixed at 1/4, where the modules are the basic cliques described in Sec. II. Values of IPR are shown in Fig. 3(a). The largest value comes from the network configuration where the single clique contains two nodes, and the probability is pi=4\u2212i+1. In this case, the network is statistically almost fragmented. Numerical results in Sec. IV indeed show the emergence of the Griffiths phase as a trivial consequence of the network disconnectedness. To examine the Griffiths phase in a connected network with a finite fractal dimension, the network configuration m=3 and pi=4\u2212i+1 is also chosen for the numerical simulation. For the stochastically constructed HMN2, as the clique size m or level-dependent probability increases while the other factor is kept fixed, modules become more and more connected with other modules in the same level, and the value of IPR decreases, shown in Fig. 3(a). The regime over the parameter m and the level-dependent pi that possibly supports the Griffiths phase is narrow. It is not surprising to see that the localized principal eigenvector exists for HMN2 network configurations with a finite value of IPR. In Figs. 3(b) and 3(c), I illustrate the localized eigenvectors corresponding to large eigenvalues in two network configurations.\n\n",

Near the critical point, in the inactive phase, the evolution equation of the SIS model, Eq.

This shows that the Griffiths phase is absent in HMN1, and we see a trivial phase transition at a single critical point. For the HMN2 network configuration with m=2 and pi=4\u2212i+1, the size-independent Griffiths phase emerges, shown in Fig. 7. However, the Griffiths phase is a trivial consequence of the disconnectedness of HMN2 as discussed in Sec. III B. For network configurations of HMN2 that are connected, I choose the case of m=3,pi=4\u2212i+1, at which the corresponding value of IPR is sufficiently large. Since intermodule connections are established stochastically, there is a chance that all the possible intermodule edges fail to be connected. To avoid this case, at least one intermodule connection is enforced to exist by repeating the construction of graphs in the simulation. Numerical results for a connected HMN2 are presented in Fig. 8. We see a nearly size-independent power law in a stretched regime of \u03bb. Comparing Fig. 7 with Fig. 8, as m increases while pi is kept fixed, and vice versa, the regime in the parameter space of \u03bb for the Griffiths phase is expected to become narrow until it disappears when HMN2 becomes highly connected.\n\n\n\n",

To solve the the conundrum between small-world topology and large-world architecture of brain networks, incorporating progressively weaker intermodule connections while maintaining well-defined modules is proposed as a solution [38]. In this work, I construct two classes of synthetic hierarchical modular networks that incorporate weak intermodule connections in distinguished ways. The first model, HMN1, builds the hierarchical small-world connections into planar modular networks. The second model, HMN2, organizes the modules into hierarchies, and the intermodule wiring probability is level dependent.

As a further exploration into the Griffiths phase caused by the structural heterogeneity of networks, I present numerical results for two classes of networks. The results suggest the essential role of the level-dependent intermodule wiring probability in the emergence of the Griffiths phase. The first class of hierarchical networks, HMN1, is not able to support the Griffiths phase, although they satisfy the structural criteria, such as the finite fractal dimension, the modular structure, and the hierarchical heterogeneity. The second class of hierarchical networks, HMN2, is constructed to possess a hierarchical pattern in the intermodule wiring probabilities, which therefore require a delicate tuning to maintain a connected, finite-dimensional network. The hierarchical pattern of intermodule connections results in more heterogeneous HMN2 networks, while HMN1 network configurations are more homogeneous. This can be shown by considering the Lifshitz tails for HMN1 and HMN2 in Fig. 4. The Lifshitz tail of HMN1 deviates from that of HMN2, and compared to HMn2, the spectrum of HMN1 is closer to the original network HN3 [39]. Although HN3 possesses a hierarchical structure, it is not sufficiently disordered to induce the Griffiths phase. The difference in the hierarchical patterns of HMN1 versus HMN2 significantly affects the phase transition and existence of the Griffiths phase.",

            "text": "As a complement to the computational efforts, the spectral analysis proposed in the quenched mean-field approximation suggests that a finite IPR of the principal eigenvector of the adjacency matrix can be considered to indicate the localization of activity that may result in the emergence of rare regions and the Griffiths phase under certain circumstances. Although all the network configurations of HMN1 prove to have a finite IPR and localized eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues, only when the structural disorder of intermodule connections is sufficient as in HMN2 does the Griffiths phase appear. As a counter example to previous finite-dimensional models with localized principal eigenvectors that support the Griffiths phase [11,12], a class of finite-dimensional networks with a localized principal eigenvector is found where the Griffiths phase is absent. This raises questions about a more generalized theoretical analysis of the network adjacency matrix that applies to all networks considered previously and currently. Besides the spectral analysis of the adjacency matrix, the Lifshitz tail of the Laplacian spectrum presents a power-law probability distribution at the lower edge of the spectrum of HMN2 networks, while the tail distribution in HMN1 deviates from a power law. Numerical results confirm that the property of the phase transition may be related to this difference in the Lifshitz tails of HMN1 versus HMN2.",
