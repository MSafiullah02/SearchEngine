In addition, analyses were performed to address concerns that this investigation had insufficient power to detect SARS\u2010CoV transmission aboard aircraft. Using the Poisson distribution, we calculated a hypothetical attack rate, given our sample size of 127 (the total number of participants with serologic results), an alpha of 0.05, and a beta of 0.2. We determined that the probability of observing zero cases was consistent with an attack rate of less than 3%. If the true rate of transmission aboard aircraft is greater than 3%, then there would have been a 95% probability of finding at least one case of aircraft exposure\u2010related SARS among the 127 persons tested for SARS\u2010CoV antibodies.",

Moreover, most cases of presumed secondary transmission occurred among persons who had visited SARS\u2010affected regions within the incubation period, leaving open the possibility that transmission could have occurred before boarding the flight. For example, Olsen\n10\nand colleagues reported that 22 of 119 passengers and crew were potentially infected during a flight from Hong Kong to Beijing.

The process of locating airline passengers for public health purposes could be significantly improved if data such as telephone numbers and addresses were provided from the airlines to public health agencies rapidly and in an electronic format. Another potential weakness involves the possibility that SARS symptoms might have been inaccurately recalled by participants, especially if interviews took place well after the flight occurred.

The probability of transmission is more likely to be determined by the infectiousness of the index patient rather than the physical setting (eg, aircraft, classroom, or hospital).
