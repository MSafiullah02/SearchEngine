Fear arising from the excess or unreliability of information about disease can lead to erratic behaviour, trigger the onset of psychiatric disorders, and even increase rates of suicide [7]. The daily flood of often contradictory information has led to panic buying of supplies that are unnecessary under conditions of spatial (or social) distancing, and to the misinterpretation of health care recommendations.",

Language barriers can intervene between the healthcare providers and indigenous people, whose lifestyles, foods, physical activities, and hygienic practices also vary. The immune profile of indigenous populations can also differ from those of the majority populations living in the same region.

These factors, in addition to the frustration of not being supported by a strong health care system and the fear of infecting people around them, increase the prevalence of symptoms of stress, depression and anxiety disorders with long-term consequences, as was seen during the SARS epidemic in 2003 [11]. A study of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei, China, conducted among 493 physicians and 764 nurses found that around half of them showed symptoms of depression and anxiety. Many of the participants also reported insomnia, and 70 % psychological distress. Women and nurses \u2013 who in great proportion were the first responders - were more affected. It is important to point out that the consequences of working under stressful conditions are not confined to HCP; stressful conditions also compromise their performance in caring for patients [12].",

Strategies for doing this can be not only technological; very vulnerable populations, such as elderly persons in nursing homes may not have wide access to the internet and electronic devices affording certain kinds of social support. Community action to alleviate the psychological impact of social isolation is thus even of greater importance. In spite of the imposition of strict confinement routines, nursing homes could risk continuing relatively safe social activities among the elderly to avoid the much greater risk of impairing the overall state of the residents\u2019 health.",
