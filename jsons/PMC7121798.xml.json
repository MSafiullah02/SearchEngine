The aim was to provide greater flexibility in terms of profit, and thus to incite establishments to improve the quality of the services they offered and professionalize their medical staff (Du, 2009).5 In 1992, the Ministry of Health officially granted greater autonomy to public hospitals, through an official document published in September 1992 by the State Council, \u201cInstructions on Health Reform\u201d.6 By this, public hospitals were authorized to deliver paid services and to make profits, but were made responsible for their losses and debts. They have to self-finance their investment in equipment and infrastructure as well as a salary bonus policy. They are also entitled to enter into joint ventures with private companies, including setting up for-profit departments within the public hospital itself. As a result of this 1992 reform, bigger hospital structures developed, as well as improved quality, thanks to the acquisition of high-tech equipment.",

            "text": "By 2003 central government funding had fallen to 8% of hospital expenditure. The fall in state financing was offset by charging for medicines and diagnosis procedures. In China, as in many other Asian countries, patients do not consult doctors in their doctor\u2019s office\u2014outside any healthcare facilities\u2014but in the hospital outpatient department. Prescriptions are given at the end of the consultation by default (patients are not asked if they want to purchase them). The total cost is the sum of the price of the consultation and that of the prescribed medicine. Patients do not have an explicit choice in not accepting the doctor\u2019s prescription. In this context, prescription prices can be varied in order to compensate for the fall in the hospital\u2019s central funding. This practice has been severely questioned during the recent healthcare reforms in China. Prescriptions currently account for about half of healthcare expenditure. The over-prescription of medicine and the over-use of high-tech equipment for diagnostic purposes have often been identified as the cause of the rapid increase in healthcare expenditure (Eggleston et al., 2008a\n8; Wang, 2005)9. The current healthcare system has been judged to be both too costly and more sophisticated than is medically necessary (World Bank, 2004\n10; Blumenthal and Hsiao, 2005\n11).

She decided to take her chance in Chengdu, Sichuan province, where she tried again to open a private clinic providing the most basic medical services. She failed again. During this time, she used her Weibo blog to explain part of her difficulties and the obstacles encountered along the way. When I interviewed her, the term \u201c bribery\u201d was never mentioned. As she said, she was able to explain her disappointment without going too far into detail about the local administrative process.

These sectors are medical sectors where customized services may generate higher margins. Maternity is also considered as a potentially profitable sector. For instance, by May 2013, AmCare had assisted in more than 10,000 births and its total revenue soared 50% to 300 million yuan ($49 million). In 2014, US-based Warburg Pincus LLC invested $100 million in Beijing-based AmCare Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital to support its expansion. Today AmCare accounts for about half of the high-end healthcare market for women and children in Beijing, which is now dominated by private hospitals.51\n",

The other is a pro-government group that advocates the need for a large government role in the production and distribution of health services. The latter prioritize issues of equity or fairness and aim at reducing social inequities. Depending on the period, each school of thought has had the upper hand in the direction given to reform. The last round of reform since 2013 is very much market-oriented, the market being expected to play a decisive role in the allocation of resources. The Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party, in November 2013, emphasized a higher priority for economic growth.
