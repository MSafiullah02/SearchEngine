Based on their affinity for substrates, the family is classified into two types: low-affinity NaDC1 and high-affinity NaDC3 (Pajor, 2000). NaDC3 is mainly expressed in metabolic active tissues, including kidney, liver, placenta, and brain (Wang et al., 2003, Bai et al., 2006). Recent studies in our lab have demonstrated that overexpression of NaDC3 gene accelerates cellular senescence (Chen et al., 2005b), but the mechanism is yet unclear.",

It delays or reduces the incidence of aging-related disorders (Ramsey et al., 2008, Longo and Kennedy, 2006, Qin et al., 2006, Chu et al., 2005, Chen et al., 2005a). Moreover, studies demonstrated that SIRT1 plays an important role in the regulation of cell fate and stress response in mammalian cells. SIRT1 promotes cell survival by inhibiting cellular senescence or apoptosis induced by stress, including DNA damage and oxidative stress, and can reverse the induced aging in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and cardiac myocytes, etc. (Cohen et al., 2004, Alcendor et al., 2004, Langley et al., 2002). SIRT1 activity depends on NAD+, which is an important coenzyme in Krebs cycle (Imai et al., 2000). Therefore, SIRT1 is a junction point between senescence and energy metabolism (Leonard and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, 2005).",

We propose a hypothesis that NaDC3 promotes aging by inhibiting NAD+-dependent SIRT1 pathway. To test this hypothesis, we firstly observed the change of SIRT1 activity and NaDC3 expression with aging in rat kidney tissue; investigated the change of SIRT1 and NAD+/NADH ratio after overexpression of NaDC3 gene in human embryonic lung diploid fibroblast (WI38 and MRC-5 cells), and studied the mechanism by which NaDC3 accelerated cellular senescence.",

Resveratrol, a polyphenol found in wines and thought to harbor major health benefits, is the specific agonist of SIRT1 enzymes. Studies have shown if expression of SIRT1 is suppressed by siRNA silencing or knock-out method, resveratrol will no longer play a biological function (Zhang et al., 2009). Niacinamide is a specific inhibitor of SIRT1 enzymes. SIRT1 activity will increase in the absence of nicotinamide (Liu et al., 2009, Wang et al., 2005, Chong et al., 2005). The WI38 cells treated with niacinamide (PD 37) showed increased enlargement and flattened inclusions similar to those of the senescent WI38 cells (PD 48). However, the morphology of the WI38 cells treated with resveratrol (PD 37) was similar to that of the young WI38 cells (PD 30). Moreover, we found that the replicative life span of WI38 cells treated with resveratrol (PD 55\u201360) was longer than that of the control cells (PD 48\u201351). In contrast, those cells treated with niacinamide ceased cell division (PD 35\u201338) earlier than the control group. SA-beta-gal staining indicated that the percentage of positive cells was 25% in control cells (PD 37), whereas almost all of the WI38 cells treated with niacinamide were positively stained, just like the senescent cells (PD 48). But only sporadic SA-beta-gal-positive cells were seen in WI38 cells with resveratrol, similar to that of the young WI38 cells (PD 30) (Fig. 4A). DAPI staining results also shown that resveratrol treatment can retard the aging of WI38; niacinamide can accelerate the aging of WI38 (Fig. 4B).",

The senescence-related phenotypes of WI38/hNaDC3 cells in the presence of CR serum or resveratrol are significantly improved compared with that of WI38/hNaDC3 cells in the absence of CR serum or resveratrol, as demonstrated by SA-beta-gal staining, population doublings, cell cycle analysis, proliferation capability and cell morphology.

To answer the question, we determined the intracellular NAD+/NADH ratio in WI38/hNaDC3 cells and found that this ratio was decreased. In a previous study, we also found that overexpression of NaDC3 can transport more intermediates into cells for cellular energy metabolism (He et al., 2004). It is known that there are five dehydrogenation reactions in the Krebs cycle, and four of the resulting hydrogens are accepted by NAD+, and NAD+ is reduced to NADH. Thus, the increase of concentration in Krebs cycle intermediates causes the decrease of NAD+/NADH ratio (Shawn et al., 2000).",

The first step is the cleavage of the high energy glycosidic bond that joins the ADP ribose moiety of NAD+ to nicotinamide. Upon cleavage, Sir2 then catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group to ADP ribose (Min et al., 2001, Zhao et al., 2004). When NAD+ exists or NAD+/NADH ratio increases, deacetylation by Sir2 occurs. But when NAD+ is omitted or NAD+/NADH ratio decreases, Sir2 will lose deacetylation (Lin et al., 2004). NaDC3 probably promotes cellular premature senescence through down-regulating the NAD+/NADH ratio, then inhibiting the level of SIRT1 activity. Our results confirm this hypothesis that NaDC3 inhibits SIRT1 activity to promote premature senescence, accompanied by the decreased level of NAD+/NADH ratio.",

Exogenous NAD+ could enter the cell freely (Araki et al., 2004) or be transported across the plasma membrane (Bruzzone et al., 2001). The data indicates that NaDC3-induced aging-associated phenotypes are attenuated when WI38/hNaDC3 cells are treated with NAD+. These results suggest that NaDC3 decreases NAD+/NADH ratio, and subsequently inhibits the SIRT1 pathway to promote cellular premature senescence. In this report, we attempt to determine whether NaDC3 induces premature senescence through the SIRT1 pathway. Our results show that NaDC3 inhibits SIRT1 enzymatic activity by down-regulating NAD+/NADH ratio in the process of cellular senescence. This mechanism will provide new pathways and targets for the intervention of cellular senescence (Fig. 8).",
