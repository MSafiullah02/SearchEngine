Data types captured and referenced by sophisticated research studies include high throughput genomic and proteomic data, laboratory data, data from imagery, and outcome data. In this paper, the authors present the application of an XMLbased data management system to support integration of data from disparate data sources and large data sets. This system facilitates management of XML schemas and on-demand creation and management of XML databases that conform to these schemas. They illustrate the use of this system in an application for genotype-phenotype correlation analyses. This application implements a method of phenotype-genotype correlation based on phylogenetic optimization of large data sets of mouse SNPs and phenotypic data. The application workflow requires the management and integration of genomic information and phenotypic data from external data repositories and from the results of phenotype-genotype correlation analyses. Our implementation supports the process of carrying out a complex workflow that includes large-scale phylogenetic tree optimizations and application of Maddison's concentrated changes test to large phylogenetic tree data sets. The data management system also allows collaborators to share data in a uniform way and supports complex queries that target data sets.",

These studies have also benefited from the considerable effort now under way to make phenotypic variation among inbred mice available in digital formats. 5 However, researchers are often exasperated by the vastness, complexity, and lack of interoperability in data resources. In practical terms, this means that researchers spend more and more of their time assembling, documenting, and updating data sets.",

This framework has been used in several applications, including a Gridenabled biomedical image management and analysis application and an application to manage data from SNPlex analyses.

This application is part of a larger project that studies the genetic bases of coronary artery disease. The overall application workflow incorporates novel methods to discover candidate genes, sequence similarity searches, and data integration to correlate genotypes and phenotypes. A key step in the workflow is the management and integration of genotypic and phenotypic data from multiple sources. In this paper, we propose and implement a schema for storing and managing output from phylogenetic tree optimization operations. We also describe how the framework is used to create and manage local caches of external data sources for data integration and analysis. The key contribution of this research study is to elucidate a middleware framework designed to provide investigators with a uniform way of interacting with a heterogeneous collection of data sources. Investigators can use these tools to invoke complex queries and design workflows. To demonstrate the value of this approach, we describe our implementation of a complex workflow that includes largescale phylogenetic tree optimizations and application of Maddison's concentrated changes test to large phylogenetic tree data sets. We should note that this article focuses on the design and implementation of the software system to support the application. The scientific findings from synthesis of information from databases supported by our implementation will be presented in a future publication.",

Their system enables linking of data at the semantic level that encodes the domain specific knowledge about data elements and their relationships. Mediation-based knowledge integration layers need to interact with a data management layer to access data sources; that is, semantic queries submitted by clients through a portal interface are translated into queries against databases controlled by the data management layer.

The Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA), 17, 18 the core set of standards developed by the Global Grid Forum (GGF), 19 builds on and extends the Web Services technologies 20 to address standard mechanisms and definitions for creating, naming, and integrating Grid services. There are some recent efforts to develop database technologies on Grid and Web services. Bell et al. 21 develop interfaces, data models, and security support for relational databases using Web services. Smith et al. 22 address the problems associated with distributed execution of queries in a Grid environment. They describe an object-oriented database prototype running on Globus. 23 Narayanan et al. 24 implement a Grid-enabled infrastructure to support management and querying of scientific data sets stored in distributed collections of flat files. The OGSA Data Access and Integration Services 25 (DAIS) working group of the GGF is a focused effort that has been developing the service definitions and standards, drawing from the core OGSA standards, for data access and integration in the Grid. Our software system has been designed as a Grid-aware system and can take advantage of emerging standards. In fact, the XML-based data management system employed in this paper builds on the evolving OGSA-DAIS standards.",

The Shared Pathology Informatics Network (SPIN) 27 initiative is intended to provide a virtual database of human tissue specimens. It develops an Internet-based software infrastructure to support a network of tissue specimen data sets and the clinical information associated with these data sets. It allows searches and requests from approved researchers into these data sets while making sure that patient confidentiality requirements are met. Several multi-institutional research projects have been funded by the European Union to investigate the application of Grid technologies for manipulating large medical image databases. [28] [29] [30] The caBIG is an initiative supported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The goal of this initiative is to develop applications and the underlying systems architecture for a nationwide cancer research network. The caBIG Grid software infrastructure (called caGrid) will facilitate distributed management and sharing of a vast array of data sources and analytical tools hosted at multiple institutions. The Mobius Global Model Exchange (GME) component of our framework is used in the caGrid infrastructure to manage XML schemas, which represent the structure of data objects that are managed and shared in the caBIG environment.",

Often underlying data are aggregated, projected, and denormalized into the corresponding XML view, making attributes of interest easily accessible via XPath queries. While this approach has been very successful, we have identified that there are still occasions when a higher level of expressivity is required by some clients and data aggregation scenarios. The root of this limitation is that XPath does not support expression of joins between documents and document collections. It is solely a data access or location language. Queries, therefore, are limited to accessing the data model as designed by the virtualization process. To support more complex userdefined filters, joins, and more complex queries, we are in the process of developing XQuery support in Mobius.",

Alternatively, the application developer can implement data extraction and translation components, which will interact with the individual data sources and create XML documents that conform to the schemas registered in the metadata service. Using the distributed execution service, the data extraction and translation components can be executed on a cluster system and the local caches of the remote sources can be created.

The emerging field of in silico association of genetic variants to disease traits has shown some success. [36] [37] [38] A major limiting factor in the field remains the availability of densely sampled DNA data across diverse strains of mice. This limitation should be substantially reduced because sequencing of whole genomes for 15 diverse mouse strains is underway (http://mouse.perlegen.com/mouse). In silico methods have been controversial as they appear quite powerful for penetrant (the likelihood that a given gene will result in disease) traits but less powerful for incompletely penetrant traits such as those that have quantitative variation or are controlled by multiple genes. 39 However, the labor and expense necessary for mapping of quantitative and polygenic traits in mouse breeding regimens are considerable. 40 Another limitation of mouse studies in general is that genetic components of complex traits in mice are not necessarily relevant to human etiologies. For instance, the human gene CETP plays a role in cholesterol processing, but no mouse CETP gene has been discovered. 41 Thus, our workflow includes means to rapidly evaluate the applicability to human disease of a candidate gene discovered in mice.",

We have adopted a phylogenetic approach because the hereditary relationships of laboratory mice strains mean that they are not statistically independent entities, thus rendering standard statistical tests inappropriate. 42 Our method takes a global approach by optimizing the SNP data into phylogenetic trees to minimize the mutations necessary to explain the observed variation. Phylogenetics sorts variation into attributes that result from common ancestry and those that have evolved independently. In doing so, it can identify mutations that occur in step with the phenotypic changes of interest. Once a set of putative phenotype-genotype correlations has been established, we assess the statistical strength of the correlation and the human biomedical relevance of candidate genes. This filtering process needs to take into account both phylogenetic treerelated statistics, merged with preexisting information contained in mouse and human gene annotations. The results can be used to (1) identify candidate genes that are already known to be relevant to the human disease under study, (2) detect novel candidate genes that are then prioritized for empirical follow-up, and (3) identify false positives. While some results are well-known candidate genes for CAD, other genes have not previously been described as candidates. Such novel candidates are prioritized for empirical follow-up.",

The application consists of two main parts. In the first part, a researcher calculates one or more phylogenetic trees from SNPs using a phylogenetic tree optimization program called POY. 43 The researcher may incorporate phenotypic data into the construction of the trees or optimize the phenotypic data onto a tree based only on genotypic data. Once a satisfactory tree has been found, the researcher creates, using POY and the phylogenetic tree, a table of inferred mutations and phenotypic changes among strains of mice (an example of the table is provided in Figure 1 ). The inferred mutations and the phenotypic changes are then examined using Maddison's 44 concentrated changes test to score putative correlations among the mutations and the phenotypic changes. Any highly correlated SNPs are output for each phenotype. The actual implementation of these steps is explained for our use cases in the section ''Finding Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms of Interest in Specific Use Cases.'' The second part of the application carries out an evaluation of the biomedical relevance of the candidate SNPs. Using a graphical user interface, the researcher selects the list of well-correlated SNPs to guide the search for haplotype blocks. The researcher then gathers annotation data on the biomedical relevance of genes contained in the haplotype blocks from multiple sources, including Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI). 45 Finally, the researcher assesses the relevance of the candidate gene(s) based on the annotation data, primary biomedical literature, and the presence of human orthologs. These steps are described in detail in the section ''Estimating Haplotypes in Strains of Interest and Using Annotation Data to Assess Biomedical Relevance of Candidate Genes.'' Execution of all the steps in the application requires sharing data among the researchers responsible for various analyses and the integration of the results with public data sources.",

The data are compiled into a database and flat files for download. In addition, a large number of SNP data sets are now publicly available in the MPD. The mpd146 data set available in the MPD is a compilation of 439,942 single and multiple nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped by many research groups for 17 mouse strains. We analyzed SNP data for 15 strains represented in mpd146, for which there were accompanying phenotype data in the MPD. The phenotype data were selected from a lipid study data set titled ''Paigen2'' 46 in the MPD. The GNF2 database contains 8,944 SNPs. 38 Although the GNF2 data have fewer SNPs, the data sets are more uniform in strain coverage, include a larger number of strains (a total of 48 strains), and are more evenly distributed along the genome.

For instance, one can look for transformations that occur in a group of branches but do not occur in another branch.

In this experiment, the data extraction and loading time for the Gene Association data set was about 20 minutes. The reason for this is that the data set used in the experiment contained about 90,000 rows. The XML schema for this data set generates an XML document for each row, containing all the attributes as XML node elements. Hence, the extractor had to submit 90,000 documents to the data server, thus incurred a large network communication overhead. The data loading time for the coordinate data set was much less because there were about 18,000 rows in total. We observe that the execution time increases linearly as the number of rows increases. This is a performance bottleneck in our current implementation. The network overheads would be more pronounced in a more distributed environment (e.g., the Grid). To reduce the network overhead, multiple documents could be combined into one buffer by the runtime system, and this buffer could be submitted to the server. This requires that the server can handle buffers containing more than one XML document. We are in the process of adding this functionality to the data service component.",

The first query type specifies an SNP identification (rsID) and two strains. In the second type of query, the client inputs a chromosome and a genomic location range. Our experimental results show that the first type of query takes on average about eight times longer to execute than the second type of query. We tried three different queries for each query type; the first query returned one result row, the second 33 result rows, and the last one 241 result rows. The average execution time of the first query type was 76 seconds, whereas the second type of query took 9 seconds on average. When the first type of query is submitted, the mpd146 data set is first searched to find the chromosome corresponding to the rsID and a corresponding genomic location. Next, a region of genetic similarity between the two query strains is computed as follows: multiple accesses to the mpd146 data set are made to find the third mismatch in alleles between the strains in regions downstream and upstream from the location identified by the rsID. On the other hand, the second type of query requires only two accesses to the mpd146 data set to extract the corresponding SNP accession numbers and other information required. In either query, once the range values are determined, the upper and lower bound values are used to find the list of marker accession IDs (see Figure 4 , the left-most column). The marker accession IDs are used as join attributes to extract information from other databases, where the marker accession ID of a data element matches one of the marker accession IDs in the list obtained from the coordinate data set. Figure 6 shows the execution time of the second type of query as the query size is scaled up. We executed three different queries in this experiment; the number of rows returned was 27, 161, and 472 rows. ",

In our implementation, queries involving joins between different data sources have been implemented as client side operations; that is, individual data sets are accessed using XPath queries and any joins between the data subsets are performed in the client application. We are currently working on integrating a subset of XQuery functionality (i.e., support for XQuery FLWR expressions) in our framework.

There are a number of standardization efforts such as SNOMED (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine), LOINC (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes), and DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine) for naming and description of data attributes and data. In cancer research, the NCI Center for Bioinformatics has developed the Cancer Data Standards Repository and the Enterprise Vocabulary Services to serve as a controlled vocabulary source in order to enable common semantics across related databases. There is also an ongoing effort in the caBIG initiative to define common data elements and controlled vocabularies to support multi-institutional basic and clinical cancer research projects. We have implemented a prototype service in Mobius to support management of semantic information using resource description framework (RDF). We plan to extend this prototype and integrate it in our software system.

A network overhead is incurred if data extractors and Mako servers are located on different machines.

This overhead could be reduced by combining multiple documents into a message buffer that is submitted to the server. Our current implementation does not support multiple documents in a single buffer. We plan to incorporate this performance optimization into our implementation in future. Another approach to reduce the data loading overhead would be to colocate extractors and Mako-servers. We also observed that the cost of executing the first type of query (as explained in the section ''Performance: Creation of Local Caches and Data Querying'' is expensive. This is because of the need for multiple accesses to the database to find the bounds for the region of genetic similarity. This overhead could be reduced by implementing data prefetching and in-memory caching. In this strategy, the entire set of attributes required for computing the bounds would be prefetched from the database and cached in an in-memory data structure (e.g., an array) in the application client when the client is started. This would reduce the overhead of querying the database multiple times. However, a caching mechanism would need to be implemented in the client to manage the in-core data structure if the set of required attributes did not fit in memory.",
