            "text": "Bronchiolitis is a common distressing, potentially life\u2010threatening respiratory condition that affects infants. Hospital admission rates in the USA and Europe for bronchiolitis are reported to be around 30 per 1,000 for children younger than 12 months and this rate has increased significantly over the past 10 years [Smyth and Openshaw, 2006]. Hospital admission is required for infants with moderate disease because mucus obstruction interferes with feeding and may induce apnoea. In the most severe cases, there is hypoxia and respiratory distress that may require mechanical ventilation [Wainwright, 2010]. Bronchiolitis is an important manifestation of viral respiratory tract infections and a large variety of viral pathogens are recognized to be implicated in majority of the hospitalized cases [Jacques et al., 2006; Mahony, 2008; Marguet et al., 2009; Wainwright, 2010]. Previous studies showed that human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) and picornaviruses [enterovirus (EVs) and rhinovirus (HRVs)] are the leading etiological causes of bronchiolitis in cohorts of French children presenting with acute respiratory pathologies including acute wheezing illnesses or bronchiolitis and asthma [Jacques et al., 2006; Jacques et al., 2008a; Frobert et al., 2011]. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), coronavirus (HCoV), human bocavirus (HBoV) have also been frequently detected in France in acute bronchiolitis in hospitalized children as well as in the community [Jacques et al., 2008b; Marguet et al., 2009; Freymuth et al., 2010].",

Among these new molecular tools, new systems based on multiplex RT\u2010PCR assays followed by low density microarray analysis have been developed and recently evaluated in a limited number of clinical samples taken from hospitalized infants [Frobert et al., 2011; Ginocchio, 2011]. These new assays could allow a rapid detection and type or subtype identification of a broad panel of common and newly identified respiratory viruses [Frobert et al., 2011; Ginocchio, 2011]. They could also improve the clinical management of infants and the prevention of the nosocomial transmission in pediatric wards and allow the development of new epidemiological survey systems for respiratory viral infections [David et al., 2010]. The aim of this study was to evaluate the analytical and clinical performances of a European Community (CE)\u2010 and in vitro diagnosis (IVD)\u2010marked commercially available multiplex RT\u2010PCR DNA microarray, the CLART\u00ae PneumoVir kit (Genomica SAU, Madrid, Spain), allowing a rapid and simultaneous detection of 17 DNA and RNA human respiratory viruses in clinical specimens.",

They were 12 months old at the most (mean age = 4 months, SD \u00b1 1.36) and were admitted in the pediatric unit within 3 days of symptoms onset [David et al., 2010]. Nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were collected at the admission and routinely addressed to the virology laboratory for respiratory viruses detection by direct immunofluorescence and virus isolation on cell culture, divided in aliquots and then stored at \u221280\u00b0C until processing with the multiplex RT\u2010PCR DNA microarray. The severity of the bronchiolitis was retrospectively analyzed using a set of five classical criteria including intensive care unit admission, O2 supply, O2 saturation percentage (pulse oxymetry) at hospital admission, O2 length and length of stay at the hospital [Marguet et al., 2009]. Informed consent was obtained from the infant's family.

            "text": "Using the CLART\u00ae PneumoVir kit, a retrospective screening of 17 respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirate samples taken from a cohort of 138 infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis in the Northern France during a full year epidemiological survey was performed. Two recent publications have described the use of this DNA microarray to study respiratory viruses in hospitalized infants admitted to intensive care units as well as in pediatrics, and in adult patients with influenza\u2010like illnesses [Renois et al., 2010; Frobert et al., 2011]. The current study compared for the first time the results obtained with the DNA microarray to those of both conventional virological methods (direct immunofluorescence and virus isolation) and (RT)\u2010PCRs for the detection of respiratory viruses. Unlike the (RT)\u2010PCRs, the DNA microarray displayed similar performances for all of the detectable viruses, except the HCoV\u2010229E suggesting lower sensitivity regarding the detection of these strains (Table I). As expected, the global detection rates appeared to be higher with the DNA microarray compared to those obtained from classical techniques (91 vs. 70%, P < 10\u22123), even for common respiratory viruses (78 vs. 68%, P = 0.01) (Table I). This result could be explained by the large number of virus species, serotypes, or subtypes detected by the DNA microarray as well as by its high sensitivity ranging from 10 to 100 copies of viral genomes per amplification tube [Coiras et al., 2003; Coiras et al., 2004; Renois et al., 2010]. The viral detection rates were comparable to those published in recent studies using multiplex detection of respiratory viruses, which reported a viral identification ranging from 61% to 95% in bronchiolitis cases [Heymann et al., 2004; Choi et al., 2006; Mahony, 2008; Marguet et al., 2009; Stempel et al., 2009]. The lower number of HRVs infections (6%) evidenced in the present work by both the DNA microarray and the (RT)\u2010PCRs could be explained by the distinction made between rhinoviruses and EVs infections often reported as a unique picornavirus group [Mahony, 2008; Ginocchio, 2011]. Furthermore, a sensitivity defect regarding HRV\u2010C detection of the molecular tools used here could not be ruled out and should be further investigated. Besides, the DNA microarray was able to identify 85 (67%) mixed respiratory tract infections, whereas none was detected by the conventional respiratory virus detection assays (Tables I and II). This rate of multiple respiratory tract infections appeared to be higher than those previously published reporting from 10% to 45% of mixed infections [Heymann et al., 2004; Choi et al., 2006; Marguet et al., 2009; Stempel et al., 2009]. These findings were confirmed by the use of the (RT)\u2010PCRs and they were not likely due to false positive results but rather to low viral loads that were below the detection levels of classical techniques previously estimated to 104 viruses per ml of nasopharyngeal aspirates [Kuypers et al., 2006]. Interestingly, in the 96 cases of hRSVA, AdVs, and PIV3 infections identified by classical techniques, it could be considered that the viral load levels were equal or superior to 104 viruses per ml of nasopharyngeal aspirate samples, and that these viral strains could be considered as the predominant respiratory viral pathogen even in cases of mixed infections identified by RT\u2010PCR assays (Tables I and II). Although the diagnostic value of the viral load in the nasopharyngeal aspirates remains unclear, the quantitation of respiratory viruses may provide important information about the role of viral pathogens in single or multiple respiratory tract infections [Kuypers et al., 2006]. In the present report, DNA microarray was only qualitative. Thus, the influence of the viral load on the disease severity could not be analyzed. Hence, in cases of mixed viral respiratory tract infections, specifically with viruses not detectable by classical techniques, it was neither possible to determine which virus was predominant and could be considered as the etiological agent nor to demonstrate whether the virus detection could be linked to beginning, ongoing, or past viral respiratory tract infections [Nokso\u2010Koivisto et al., 2002; Kuypers et al., 2006; Mahony, 2008].",

This approach confirmed that several viruses as HBoV, HRVs, AdVs, hMPV\u2010A/B, and PIV3 could be frequently detected (Table I) [Papadopoulos et al., 2002; Jartti et al., 2004; L\u00f3pez\u2010Huertas et al., 2005; Jacques et al., 2006; Pozo et al., 2007; Mahony, 2008]. In addition to the classical epidemic circulation of hRSV\u2010A/B during the winter season, the DNA microarray showed a concomitant epidemic circulation of AdVs, PIV3, HBoV, hMPV\u2010A/B, HRVs, and EVs resulting in (73/85) 86% of the mixed RTIs detected. In addition, the epidemiological survey conducted over 1 year confirmed a spring peak of HBoV infections that was not detected by use of conventional techniques (Fig. 1).",

Statistical analyses revealed that none of the bronchiolitis severity criteria was significantly increased in cases of mixed infections compared to single infections, and that no specific viral combination was associated with the severity of the disease (Table III). These findings were not in agreement with previous studies reporting that dual hMPV/hRSV infection conferred an increased risk of admission to pediatric intensive care unit [Semple et al., 2005; Richard et al., 2008; Stempel et al., 2009]. The results presented here could be explained by the low proportion of premature newborns and the low rate of hMPV infections detected. However, as previously reported, only infants infected by hRSV stayed longer in hospital [Marguet et al., 2009]. This suggests that hRSV might be the most aggressive viral agent for bronchiolitis in infants younger than 12 months [Marguet et al., 2009]. Given the large panel of multiple viral infections detected in the present study (Table II), further multicenter studies will be necessary to assess whether specific viral associations could confer an elevated risk of severe bronchiolitis.",
