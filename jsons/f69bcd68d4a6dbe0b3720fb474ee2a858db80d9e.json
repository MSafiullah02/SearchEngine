An increasing amount of social scientific research has looked at the role of public message framing, for instance, but few studies have thus far examined the role of individual differences in emotional and personality-based variables in predicting virus-mitigating behaviors. In this study, we recruited a large international community sample (N = 324) to complete measures of self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19, fear of the virus, moral foundations, political orientation, and behavior change in response to the pandemic. Consistently, the only predictor of positive behavior change (e.g., social distancing, improved hand hygiene) was fear of COVID-19, with no effect of politically relevant variables. We discuss these data in relation to the potentially functional nature of fear in global health crises.",

This claim was supported through a comparison of confirmed case rates between South Korea (who adopted widespread public testing for COVID-19 in February 2020) and Italy (who tested only those with symptoms), with Backhaus (2020) reporting how, in South Korea, substantially higher rates of younger people (below the age of 30) tested positive for the virus in the absence of noticeable symptoms.",

China, for example, appeared to have halted the exponential increase of confirmed cases of the virus by limiting the freedom of citizens to move around their cities, provinces, and the country as a whole (Graham-Harrison and Kuo 2020) . The Italian government has implemented a similar strategy, placing much of the country into lockdown and preventing groups of people from congregating in public spaces. Other countries have been slower to respond with such drastic action. The USA, for example, waited more than 2 weeks after the first confirmed case within its borders to enact localized testing procedures (Baird 2020) . Elsewhere, the British government followed the instructions of its scientific advisors to delay the cancellation of mass gatherings and the closure of schools, instead favoring a policy that looked akin to pursuing herd immunity (whereby vulnerable groups are isolated, and healthier individuals are exposed to the virus to gain immunity at the population level; Fine et al. 2011) .",

This means that everybody should be limiting non-essential social interactions, not travel unless absolutely necessary, and work from home wherever possible to slow the interpersonal transmission of the virus. However, this is being practiced inconsistently in the absence of government enforcement. In this paper, we explore some of the potential psychological triggers for this inconsistency in social distancing behavior.",

This research examines how to encourage prosocial and virus-mitigating responses (e.g., social distancing, or the non-hoarding of food and household supplies, and good hand hygiene). For example, Everett et al. (2020) reported how communicating advice using deontological moral advice (i.e., in ways that invoke a sense of civic duty) has a modest effect on increasing a propensity to engage in behaviors that enhance a delay in the transmission of the virus (e.g., hand washing, avoiding large gatherings, and sharing government advice on preventing the spread of . This sense of duty taps into themes of interpersonal empathy, with Oosterhoff and Palmer (2020) findings that American adolescents who demonstrated higher levels of subjective self-interest were more likely to hoard supplies and less likely to refrain from nonessential social interactions. Pfattheicher et al. (2020) reported how trait empathy for vulnerable members of the population encourages the reduction of physical social interactions, while inducing empathy maintains this behavior. Further, a rapid review of the evidence into compliance with quarantine advice during pandemics recently reported that appealing to altruistic motivations to comply with distancing instructions appears to maintain motivation to maintain social distance from others over an extended period of time (Brooks et al. 2020) .",

            "text": "While this raft of empirical work appears to be focused around persuading the community to follow social distancing advice, there may also be intrinsic or individual difference reasons for following such isolating practices. Moral foundations theory (for a review, see Haidt and Joseph 2004) asserts that individuals make social and political judgments based on their endorsement of propositions rooted in a finite set of intuitive moral domains. In the main, political liberals value making decisions on the basis of care/harm (i.e., protection of the vulnerable) and fairness/reciprocity (i.e., proportionality) principles, while political conservatives also value authority/respect, ingroup/loyalty, and purity/sanctity. There is a case to be made that these moral foundations may play a role in decisions to engage in advice about delaying the spread of COVID-19. For example, framing of vulnerability among certain demographic groups (e.g., the elderly, pregnant, and chronically ill) has the potential to trigger the care/harm foundation. Further, the advice coming from governmental or scientifically authoritative sources may trigger instincts related to the authority foundation, while the infectious nature of the virus, by definition, is likely to trigger a behavioral response associated with pathogen avoidance via the disgust foundation. For these reasons, it is unlikely that \"political orientation\" as a composite or self-identified variable would predict behavioral responses to COVID-19. However, specific moral foundations that are associated with positions across the ideological spectrum may differentially predict actions that mitigate the risk of the virus being spread.",

            "text": "According to Ahorsu et al. (2020) , one unique feature of pandemic viral infections is the fear that they can instill across large swathes of the population. Fear is a negative emotion symptomized by extreme levels of emotive avoidance in relation to specific stimuli (Perin et al. 2015) . It is associated with clinical phobias and social anxiety disorder (Krueger et al. 2018) , and as such the potential for widespread public fear caused by pandemic viral infections could lead to significant levels of mental distress at the population level. This was implicated in a tweet published by Dr. David Murphy (president of the British Psychological Society) that highlighted fear and anxiety (operationalized as managing health anxiety and coping with worry about relatives) as targets for psychological input within the COVID-19 pandemic (Murphy 2020) . In spite of the documented negative wellbeing implications of fear and anxiety, these negative emotions do also motivate a range of behaviors that reduce the engagement in risky behaviors. For example, early levels of anxiety in children are associated with lower levels of alcohol use (Kaplow et al. 2001 ) and cigarette and marijuana use (Colder et al. 2013) . Further, pathological low levels of fear are widely associated with psychopathic personality traits (see Patrick et al. 2009; Patrick and Drislane 2015) , and this has been related to various risk-taking for social and recreational purposes (Satchell et al. 2018) . This is also consistent with emerging evidence that higher levels of so-called dark personality traits (e.g., psychopathy, meanness, and disinhibition) are associated with a lack of engagement with health-promoting behaviors in the COVID-19 pandemic (Blagov 2020) . As such, the potential utility of a fear or anxiety response in the current context should be explored.",

This claim is supported by Zettler et al. (2020) , who reported that the HEXACO personality domain of emotionality (characterized by exaggerated levels of anxiety, fear, and emotional reactivity) was associated with a greater level of acceptance of government-mandated personal restrictions. Further, Kuper-Smith et al. (2020) found that community members in the USA, the UK, and Germany consistently underestimated their likelihood of both becoming infected and transmitting COVID-19 in comparison with estimates about the \"average\" member of the public (see also Raude et al. 2020) . They also reported negative correlations between self-perceived likelihood of infecting others and engaging in hygiene-related behaviors (e.g., hand washing and social distancing), suggesting that increasing fears about contracting the virus might lead to less risky social behaviors.",

This is in response to an apparent mismatch between established psychopathological research into the potential utility and fear and anxiety in reducing risky behaviors, and the suggestion by Ahorsu et al.

Finally, we investigated the role of political ideology in changing behaviors in response to COVID-19. In doing so, we acknowledged the partisan nature of some social attitudes toward the virus itself (Pennycook et al. 2020) and governmental responses to the pandemic (see Pepinsky 2020) while contemplating the potential for intuitive moral foundations to overcome these identity-based political differences.",

Critically, these relationships were generally positive, in that those participants who were more concerned about COVID-19 (as measured by the FCV-19S) were those who engaged more with public health-compliant behaviors (e.g., regular hand washing, and social distancing). It is of interest that the measures of fear and anxiety symptoms were stronger predictors than moral and political orientation, all of which explained small to no variance, potentially suggesting more emotional (rather than sociopolitical) influences on compliant behavior. There was also no notable decline in quality of life in relation to behavior change. However, fear of COVID-19 was related to decreased physical and environmental wellbeing.

            "text": "Functional \"Fear\" In the development of the FCV-19S the authors rightly state that \"[w]ith high levels of fear, individuals may not think clearly and rationally when reacting to COVID-19\" (Ahorsu et al. 2020, p. 2) . This is true for the pure emotion of fear, which represents the reactive removal of oneself from a position of immediate risk. However, many of the items in the FCV-19S scale are pertinent to anxiety, a preparatory reaction to ambiguous or distant stimuli. Beyond the conceptual similarity in the wording of items, our analysis revealed a strong relationship between the FCV-19S and DSM-based measures of anxiety. This is important as fear and anxiety are behaviorally and neuroendocrinologically distinct responses (McNaughton and Corr 2008), with anxiety potentially having a functional preparative role to encounter future negative stimuli consistent with the data we have presented here. Indeed, as has been described in detail previously (for a review, see Perkins and Corr 2014), negative emotions, broadly, may have evolved to serve more adaptive and protective functions and may, in certain contexts, help to keep us safe. In the current context, this appears to be the case with negative emotions being protective (i.e., encouraging of public health-promoting behaviors) during the COVID-19 pandemic. That is, the results of the current study suggest that negative emotions in response to the current pandemic predict adaptive public health-compliant behavior change (e.g., hand washing, social distancing). These findings, situated within the aforementioned larger literature pertaining to the oftentimes adaptive nature of the experience of negative emotions, raise serious concerns with efforts to identify \"mental health issues\" associated with strong emotional responses, which, for the majority of individuals, are both normative and protective. That is, for most individuals, the anxious responses being assessed by the FCV-19 may represent a normal and adaptive response to a real and present danger that one cannot fight or flee from, within the environment (i.e., the COVID-19 pandemic). Those working in the mental health field should be sensitive to the context in which behaviors emerge, especially when these behaviors exist in a culture of preparedness for coping with the new cultural and governmental demands that may be critical for personal and family survival.",

Indeed, increased and prolonged exposure to a community crisis, like the pandemic we are currently experiencing, has been found to result in increased maladaptive levels of anxiety leading to unnecessary behaviors associated with increased levels of impairments within individuals as well as overburdening of community resources (Garfin et al. 2020) . Overall, we believe that mental health professionals have an important role to play in supporting the wellbeing of the public in this current time. However, it is not clear how this work is supported by the classification of rational concerns about a pandemic and the labelling of functional \"fear\" as a psychological issue.",

            "text": "In this previously reported work, US-based Democrats were more likely than Republicans to engage in health-promoting behaviors (e.g., regular hand washing, social distancing, and self-quarantining), and to express attitudes that were critical of governmental responses to the pandemic (e.g., that inadequate testing was available, or that more money should be made available to tackle the virus). An obvious difference in our data is the political contextslightly less than 80% of our sample were British, rather than American. However, it could be that this work reflects the stage of the pandemic in which the partisan data were collected. At the time of writing, the USA is in an earlier phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a manner consistent with a social intuitionist account of political and moral decision-making (Haidt 2001) , it is therefore plausible that initial (and perhaps intuitive) judgments of the pandemic in the US context were guided by President Trump's initial rejection of COVID-19 as a serious and unique public health concern (Trump 2020). These initial intuitions then led to asymmetrical responses between partisans in Pepinsky's (2020) work: ambivalence and inaction among Republicans, and concern and derision of the response among Democrats. However, in the UK (where the majority of our participants were based), the pandemic is at a slightly more advanced stage, meaning that the seriousness of the situation is clearer. We argue that the lack of any significant political orientation or moral foundations effects on behavior change is a positive point from a social perspective, and suggests that, in times of (inter)national crisis, people can forgo their ideological commitments and behave consistently with governmental advice in pursuit of a common public health good.",

            "text": "The results of this study are not without limitation. First, the data presented here are entirely self-reported and so may be subject to response biases. Specifically, virus-mitigating behavior changes such as increased hand washing, working from home, and social distancing are all targets of governmental strategy to \"flatten the curve\" and reduce the spread of the virus (e.g., Public Health England 2020). As such, it may be expected that this constellation of behavioral changes will be reported to a greater degree as a function of a reluctance to deviate from this normative social shift. The collection of \"other-reported\" data on the participants would help to mitigate this limitation. Second, while our regression models have utility for informing how public health behavioral compliance can be predicted from an individual differences perspective, it lacks the identification and understanding of any potential barriers to bringing about said change. It is here where experimental studies emerging about the response to COVID-19 (e.g., Everett et al. 2020) can be supplemented by correlational data such as ours in order to bring about a more comprehensive view of public health compliance and the effectiveness of government messaging. Finally, we are mindful that data has been collected at a single time point within an unprecedented period of time. Therefore, not only do results of this investigating warrant replication, but also future investigations should consider any potential variation in governmental guidance, policy, or social perception pertaining to COVID-19 in their discussion and interpretation of results.",
