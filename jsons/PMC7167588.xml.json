ACE2 receptor also converts angiotensin I into angiotensin1-9, which in turn is converted to angiotensin1-7 by ACE and neprilisin (Figure 1\n). The catalytic efficiency of ACE2 is 400 times higher on angiotensin II than on angiotensin I.

[7] Notably, SARS-CoV and Sars-CoV2 share a 76% identity in the amino acid sequence, [8] thereby explaining the propensity of these viruses for binding with ACE2. Some structural variations of human ACE2 have been identified that are characterized by a lower binding affinity with the spike viral protein, with potential protective implications. [9] The first step of viral entry process is the binding of the N-terminal portion of the viral protein unit S1 to a pocket of the ACE2 receptor. The second step, which is believed to be of utmost importance for viral entry, is the protein cleavage between the S1 and S2 units, which is operated by the receptor transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), a member of the Hepsin/TMPRSS subfamily. [10] TMPRSS2 is stechiometrically contiguous to ACE2 receptor. [10] The cleavage of the viral protein by TMPRSS2 is a crucial step because, after S1 detachment, the remaining viral S2unit undergoes a conformational rearrangement which drives and completes the fusion between the viral and cellular membrane, with subsequent entry of the virus into cell, release of its content, replication, and infection of other cells. The importance of TMPSRR2 is supported by the evidence that entry of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 into cells is partially blocked by camostat mesylate, an inhibitor of TMPSRR2. [2]\n",

[45] After ovariectomy, female animals showed similar reactions as in males. [45] These data suggest that ACE2 deficiency may favor obesity-induced hypertension. [45] ACE2 is also expressed in the cardiac adipocytes. [46] Obese patients with heart failure have an increased amount of epicardial adipose tissue [46] and it has been suggested that ACE2 deficiency can induce heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in animals.

[52] Therefore, the damage of pneumocytes type II due to the binding of coronavirus to ACE2 receptors is devastating for at least three reasons: 1) local unopposed ACE\u2192Angiotensin II\u2192AT1 receptor axis over-activity; 2) reduced production of alveolar surfactant by injured pneumocytes type II leading to reduced lung elasticity; 3) reduced repair of pneumocytes type I leading to impaired gas exchanges and fibrosis.

For example, ACE2 expression in the lungs markedly decreases with ageing, [60] to a greater extent in men than women. [60] Diabetes mellitus has been associated with reduced ACE2 expression, possibly as effect of glycosylation. [61], [62], [63] Several experimental and clinical studies indicate that ACE2 deficiency obtained through deletion or inhibition may be a causative factor for hypertension. [14,64] Treatment with soluble recombinant ACE2 reduces the blood pressure rise provoked by angiotensin II, increases angiotensin1-7 and reduces angiotensin II. [65] ACE2 deficiency has been associated with exacerbation of hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy induced by angiotensin II, [66] and maladaptive left ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction. [67] Furthermore, deficiency of ACE2 enhances the susceptibility to heart failure. [14] A heterozygote loss of ACE2 is believed sufficient to increase the susceptibility to heart disease. [68]\n",

[76], [77], [78], [79], [80], [81], [82], [83], [84] Several Scientific Societies and various experts in this area expressed the position that discontinuation of these drugs is not justified by evidence and could be dangerous. [76,77,81,82] On the other hand, several experimental data discussed above suggest the potential utility of ARBs, particularly to limit lung inflammation during viral invasion. [80,83] It is hoped that the results of the above mentioned NCT04312009 and NCT04311177 trials will answer this question.",

Some degree of ACE2 deficiency has been associated with a variety of conditions including older age, hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, which also characterize people more likely to be infected and to present more severe complications. In a setting of enhanced ACE2 deficiency produced by the viral invasion, the marked dysregulation between the \u2018adverse\u2019 ACE\u2192Angiotensin II\u2192AT1 axis and the \u2018protective\u2019 ACE2\u2192Angiotensin1-7\u2192Mas axis would contribute to enhance the progression of inflammatory and thrombotic processes. These considerations provide a rationale for investigating the role of therapeutic approaches conceptually linked to ACE2 receptor activity. These include the use of soluble recombinant ACE2, angiotensin1-7, and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers, which are currently being evaluated.",
