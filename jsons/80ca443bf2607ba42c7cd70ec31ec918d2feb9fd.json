So far, prognosis factors of COVID-19 mainly focus on the immune cells. In our study, we found that older age, higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein (CRP), RDW (the coefficient of variation of red blood cell distribution width), DBIL (direct bilirubin), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and lower albumin (ALB) on admission correlated with higher odds of severe COVID-19. Based on these indexes, we developed and validated an effective prognostic nomogram with high sensitivity and specificity for accurate individualized assessment of the incidence of severe COVID-19. Among these indexes, the prognostic role of RDW in COVID-19 is underestimated, which is associated with the increased turnover of erythrocytes. Our results hinted that the turnover of RBC might be involved in severe illness. Of all potential predictors in the dataset, 0.09 % of the fields had missing values. Predictor exclusion was limited to those with more than 7% missing rate to minimize the bias of the regression coefficient. [16] . Little's MCAR test (R package BaylorEdPsych) was used to assess the suitability of the remaining missing values for imputation. This test is used to test whether missing values are \"missing completely at random\" (MCAR) or biased. The missing values were imputed by expectation-maximization (EM) method using SPSS statistical software, version 25 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).",

Furthermore, we developed an effective prognostic nomogram composed of 7 features, had significantly high sensitivity and specificity to distinguish individuals with severe COVID-19 from non-severe COVID-19. DCA and CICA further indicated that our nomogram conferred significantly high clinical net benefit, which is of great value for accurate individualized assessment of the incidence of severe COVID-19. NLR, a widely used marker for the assessment of system inflammation, was not identified by LASSO as an important feature instead of LDH and CRP, which are associated with the systemic inflammatory response [9] . However, LDH could predict severity of tissue damage in early stage of diseases as an auxiliary marker [10] . These might be reasons why the lasso model did not identified NLR as a more important feature. Consistent with other reports, our results indicate that patients with higher levels of inflammation at admission might be at higher risk for severe COVID-19 as well.",

In addition, INF-\u03b3 contributes to apoptosis of the erythroid progenitors and decrease the EPO receptor expression [18] . 3) RBC are dynamic reservoirs of cytokines [19] . Decreased deformability of RBC in severe illness leads to RBC lysis and release of intracellular contents into the circulation [20] , including some inflammatory cytokines. This positive feedback could greatly promote the apparent shortened RBC survival and ultimately more morphological variations in cell sizes (i.e., elevated RDW), increased inflammatory response, and lead to severe illness. RDW can be regarded as an index of enhanced patient fragility and higher vulnerability to adverse outcomes [21] . The elevated RDW may explain fatigue experienced by severe COVID-19 patients.",

Suspected cases of COVID-19 requires meeting any of the following epidemiology history criteria or any two of the following clinical manifestations: (A) Epidemiological history: a history of travel to or residence in Wuhan in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset; contact with a confirmed or suspected case of 2019-nCOV infection in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset; aggressive disease onset. (B) Clinical manifestation: Fever and/or respiratory infection, or with normal/decreased white blood cells counts and normal/decreased lymphocyte counts. In the absence of the above mentioned criteria for epidemiological history, the suspected case should meet with all of the above mentioned criteria for clinical manifestation. A confirmed case was defined as an individual with laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 which required positive results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms. For diagnosis of Severe COVID-19 group, at least one of the following conditions should be met: (1) Shortness of breath, Respiratory rate (RR) \u226530times/min, (2) Arterial oxygen saturation (Resting status) \u226493%, or (3) the ratio of Partial pressure of oxygen to Fraction of inspiration O2(PaO-2/ FiO-2)\u2264300mmHg.",

However, a nomogram could present a quantitive and practical predictor tool for risk stratification of non-severe COVID-19 patients at admission. Though Liu et al developed a nomogram from a single center with a small sample size and no external validation[6], our nomogram has a significantly higher AUC in the training and validation cohorts than Liu's nomogram (0.912/0.853 vs 0.849). Our nomogram predicted a total of 188.6358 points at a 19.0 % probability threshold, which was close prevalence of severe COVID-19 (14.8%) in the training cohort and hence consistent with the reality. This cut-off value may lead to a slight increase of false positive rates but in the setting of this COVID-19 outbreak, a little high false positive rates are acceptable in order to minimize risks of missed diagnosis. Meanwhile, application of the nomogram in the training cohort and validation cohort showed good differentiation with AUC values of 0.912 and 0.853 respectively, as well as high sensitivity and specificity.Furthermore, only seven easy-access features were included in our nomogram, including older age, higher LDH and CRP, DBIL, RDW, BUN, and lower ALB. Among of them, age, NLR and LDH has been reported to be risk factors for severe patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection[3,[6][7][8].",
