The reported incidence of emerging and re-emerging zoonotic disease is increasing in many parts of the world. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) first emerged 17 years ago (Drosten et al., 2003). In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) crossed species barriers to infect humans (Gorbalenya et al., 2020) and was effectively transmitted from person to person, leading to a pneumonia outbreak first reported in Wuhan, China (Guan et al., 2020, Jiang et al., 2020, Zhou et al., 2020b). This virus causes coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) with influenza-like symptoms ranging from mild disease to severe lung injury and multi-organ failure, eventually leading to death, especially in older patients with other co-morbidities. The WHO has declared that COVID-19 is a public health emergency of pandemic proportions (https://www.who.int/). The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is not only an enormous burden to public health but has already markedly affected civil societies and the global economy.",

Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated that this virus belongs to lineage B of the betacoronavirus genus (Chan et al., 2020, Letko et al., 2020). The receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the SARS-CoV RBD, suggesting a possible common host cell receptor. ACE2 was identified as the functional SARS-CoV receptor in vitro and, by our group, in vivo (Imai et al., 2005, Kuba et al., 2005). Overexpression of human ACE2 enhanced disease severity in mice infected with SARS-CoV, demonstrating that ACE2-dependent viral entry into cells is a critical step (Yang et al., 2007). We reported that injecting SARS-CoV spike into mice decreased ACE2 expression levels, thereby worsening lung injury (Imai et al., 2005, Kuba et al., 2005). Thus, ACE2 serves both as the entry receptor of SARS-CoV and to protect the lung from injury (Zhang et al., 2020b).",

Recently, it has been demonstrated in cell culture that soluble ACE2 fused to Ig (Wrapp et al., 2020) or a nonspecific protease inhibitor called camostat mesylate (Hoffmann et al., 2020), can inhibit infections with a pseudovirus bearing the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. High doses (100 \u03bcg/mL) of camostat mesylate were also shown to partially reduce SARS-CoV-2 growth, as expected from previous studies with other viruses (Hoffmann et al., 2020).",

            "text": "In a normal adult human lung, ACE2 is expressed primarily in alveolar epithelial type II cells, which can serve as a viral reservoir (Zhao et al., 2020). These cells produce surfactant that reduces surface tension, thus preventing alveoli from collapsing, and hence are critical to the gas exchange function of the lung (Dobbs, 1989). Injury to these cells could explain the severe lung injury observed in COVID-19 patients. We and others have also shown that ACE2 is expressed in multiple extrapulmonary tissues including heart, kidneys, blood vessels, and intestine (Crackower et al., 2002, Danilczyk and Penninger, 2006, Ding et al., 2004, Gu et al., 2005, Hamming et al., 2004, Zhang et al., 2020b). The ACE2 tissue distribution in these organs may explain the multi-organ dysfunction observed in patients (Guan et al., 2020, Huang et al., 2020). Here, we report that clinical-grade human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2), which has already been tested in phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials (Haschke et al., 2013, Khan et al., 2017), can reduce viral growth in Vero E6 cells by a factor of 1,000\u20135,000. Moreover, we show that human blood vessel organoids and kidney organoids can be readily infected, which can be significantly inhibited by hrsACE2 at the early stage of infection.",

To this end, we infected Vero-E6 cells (cells used for SARS-CoV-2 isolation) with different numbers of SARS-CoV-2: 103 plaque-forming units (PFUs; MOI 0.02), 105 PFUs (MOI 2), and 106 PFUs (MOI 20). Viral RNA as a marker for replication was purified from cells and assayed by qRT-PCR (Figure 2\nA).

In contrast to hsrACE-2, the equivalent mouse recombinant soluble ACE2 (mrsACE2), produced in the same way as hrsACE2, did not inhibit the infection (Figure 2B). Finally, we performed experiments where cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of hrsACE2 or mrsACE2 for 15 h, to capture any newly produced virus particles during the 15 h that could infect neighboring cells. Again, we observed significantly reduced virus infections in the presence of hrsACE2 (Figure 2C), but not mrsACE2 (Figure 2D). Of note, addition of human or mouse rsACE2 was not toxic to the Vero-E6 cells, monitored for 15 h (data not shown).

Moreover, viremia is established during the course of the disease, although viral RNA in blood is only infrequently observed (Wang et al., 2020). However, the virus has a size of 80\u2013100 nm indicating that viremic SARS-CoV-2 must first infect blood vessels prior to local tissue infections. To test this hypothesis, we established human capillary organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Figure 3\nA) and infected them with our SARS-CoV-2 isolate. Of note, these organoids closely resemble human capillaries with a lumen, CD31+ endothelial lining, PDGFR+ pericyte coverage, as well as formation of a basal membrane (Wimmer et al., 2019). The capillary organoids were analyzed by qRT-PCR for the presence of viral RNA at day 3 and 6 after primary SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Importantly, following infection, we could detect viral RNA in the blood vessel organoids with viral RNA increasing from day 3 to day 6 post-infection (Figure 3B), indicating active replication of SARS-CoV-2.",

To test whether SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect human tubular kidney cells, we generated kidney organoids from human embryonic stem cells into 3D suspension culture, adapting our own protocol (Garreta et al., 2019). Importantly, kidney differentiation organoids demonstrated prominent tubular-like structures as detected by Lotus tetraglobus lectin (LTL) as a marker of proximal tubular epithelial cells (Figure 4\nA). Tubular-like cells also expressed the solute carrier SCL3A1 (Figure S1\nA) together with SCL27A2 and SCL5A12. Furthermore, LTL-positive (LTL+) cell fractions from organoids expressed markers of proximal tubular identity (Figures S1B and S1C). Single-cell profiling of kidney organoids showed the presence of cells expressing ACE2 in the proximal tubule and podocyte II cell clusters that express key marker genes of proximal tubular cells (SLC3A1 and SLC27A2) and podocytes (PODXL, NPHS1, and NPHS2), respectively (Figure S2\n). Thus, kidney organoids contain cell clusters that express ACE2 in a similar fashion to that observed in the native tissue (Lin et al., 2020).",

Progeny virus was determined as above using re-infections of Vero E6 cells. As expected from cells and tissues that express ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 replicated in kidney organoids (Figure 4B). Supernatant of infected kidney organoids collected at day 6 post-infection could efficiently infect Vero E6 cells (Figure 4C), showing that the engineered kidney organoids produced infectious progeny virus. Importantly, addition of hrsACE2 significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 infections of the human kidney organoids in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4D). Of note, addition of human or mouse rsACE2 was not toxic to the kidney, monitored for 3 days (data not shown). These data indicate that besides blood vessels, engineered human kidney organoids can also be infected with SARS-CoV-2, and this infection can be inhibited by hrsACE2.",

Second, we did not study lung organoids, and the lung is the major target organ for COVID-19. Finally, the RAS system represents a complex network of pathways that are influenced by external processes that are not simulated in our model systems. To address these issues, further studies are needed to illuminate the effect of hrsACE2 at later stages of infection in vitro and in vivo.",

Principal component analysis was performed, and 20 components were kept for further analysis. Clustering was performed by setting the resolution parameter to 0.4. Dimensional reduction was done using the RunUMAP function of the Seurat R package. Cell markers were identified by using a Wilcoxon test. Genes with adjusted p.value < 0.5 were retained. Clusters were labeled by comparing the expression of the identified markers with publicly available databases (Wu et al., 2018b) located in KIT (Kidney Interactive Transcriptomics webpage (http://humphreyslab.com/SingleCell/).",
