            "text": "Influenza A and B virus infections are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The three influenza types, A, B and C, are divided based on antigenic differences in their nucleoproteins (NP). Matrix (M) proteins have also been used for wide-range classification (Widjaja et al., 2004) . Influenza A viruses are further classified into subtypes based on antigenic differences of the surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) . Currently, there are 16 distinct HA (H1-H16) and 9 NA (N1-N9) subtypes. Three subtypes of HA (H1-H3) and two subtypes of NA (N1 and N2) are found among influenza A viruses that have caused epidemics among humans (Gregory et al., 2002) . Influenza A virus HA and NA glycoproteins undergo gradual point mutations known as antigenic drift. In contrast, antigenic shifts are saltatory evolutionary events due to reassortment of RNA segments from different subtypes in co-infected cells. Influenza B and C viruses display a lower variability than influenza A viruses, and human strains with antigenic shift have not yet been observed (Murphy and Webster, 1996) . However, B and C viruses are represented by a smaller number of sequences than those from influenza A, which might bias the judgement of their variability. Although study of influenza C is lacking, it is known to cause both trivial and more serious respiratory diseases (Matsuzaki et al., 2005) . Possible animal reservoirs of influenza B and C are not completely known and should be investigated.",

The current subtypes of influenza A viruses found in humans include two HA subtypes (H1 and H3) and two NA subtypes (N1 and N2). During the past few years, sporadic human cases of infection with other subtypes of influenza A, including H5N1, H5N2, H7N7, H7N3 and H9N2, which are all hosted by birds, have been reported (Fouchier et al., 2004; Kuiken et al., 2005; Ogata et al., 2008; Saito et al., 2001; Tweed et al., 2004) .

To achieve the goal of broad targeting the highly variable influenza A target sequence, we developed a new kind of probe, MegB. MegB allows for the use of very long and mismatch-tolerant nuclease-degradable probes. Such probes are hard to synthesise as conventional TaqMan \u00ae probes because of the necessity to introduce an internal quencher in a long oligonucleotide.",

The number of variant nucleotides (up to four) and the percent of nucleotides identical to the most frequent nucleotide (the consensus nucleotide) per position in an alignment can also be visualised graphically (see Fig. 1S in the Supplementary Material). This program has been used in several publications where it is described further (Bindra et al., 2007; Elfaitouri et al., 2006; Escutenaire et al., 2007; Forsman et al., 2003; Gyarmati et al., 2007; Mohamed et al., 2004 Mohamed et al., , 2006 Muradrasoli et al., 2006 Muradrasoli et al., , 2009 Yacoub et al., 2009) .",

This method is further referred to as 3QPCR. The 3QPCR method and its results are elaborated in the Supplementary Material. Due to a few false negative results with a few influenza A samples and the InfluANP-probe, a new broadly targeted probe (MegB) was designed. In further developments using 3QPCR-MegB, rTth polymerase was replaced with the iScript one-step RT-PCR kit for probes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA) because a lower amplification efficiency and lower fluorescence signal was attained when rTth was used. However, UNG cannot be used with iScript because it interferes with reverse transcription in this enzyme mixture. The iScript kit was used in further experiments with 3QPCR-MegB. Primer and probes for influenza B and C were the same as for 3QPCR. The primers for influenza A were also the same, but the probe was changed to MegB. 3QPCR-MegB was carried out in a total volume of 50 l containing 25 l of 2\u00d7 RT-PCR reaction mix for probes, 5 l of RNA extract, a final concentration of 500 nM of each forward and reverse primer, 150 nM of a dual-labelled fluorogenic probe for influenza A, B and C viruses, respectively, and 1 l of iScript reverse transcriptase. The subsequent RT step was performed at 50 \u2022 C for 30 min, immediately followed by an initial denaturation at 95 \u2022 C for 10 min. A total of 55 cycles were then performed, each consisting of a denaturation step at 94 \u2022 C for 30 s and an annealingextension step in which the annealing temperature was 56 \u2022 C for 30 s in the first two cycles and was then decreased by 2 \u2022 C every second cycle down to 46 \u2022 C, according to the touch-down principle (Korbie and Mattick, 2008; Mohamed et al., 2006) . Fluorescence data were collected during each annealing-extension step in the FAM channel for influenza A virus, the ROX channel for influenza B and the Cy5 channel for influenza C. Negative and positive PCR controls were included in each analytical round. 3QPCR-MegB was performed using the Corbett Research RotorGene Real Time Amplification system (RG 2000; Corbett Research, Mortlake, NSW Australia). RotorGene TM software version 6.4 (Corbett Research) was used for threshold selection and standard curve interpolation to derive approximate RNA concentrations relative to RNA and DNA standards. The term \"genome equivalents\" is preferable to the term \"copies\". Here, this term refers to the concentrations interpolated from the standard curve of 10-fold dilution series of synthetic influenza A, B and C target DNA oligonucleotides ( Fig. 1A-D) .",

This search was reiterated in January 2006 to check for new sequence variants. Another check was performed in 2008. The searches were made in the entire \"Viruses\" subset of GenBank. The presentation options \"query anchored with identities\" and \"-v 8000 -b 8000\" were specified to ensure that all sequence variants were included in the output alignment. The reference strains of influenza A, B and C that were used for querying the database were AY684707, NC002208 and M17700, respectively. The BLAST alignments were examined by ConSort \u00a9 to detect conserved regions suitable for primer and probe construction. Conserved stretches were found in the NP gene. One pair of degenerate primers was designed for each influenza type to amplify a fragment of 152, 119 and 100 bp for influenza A, B and C, respectively. A score cutoff of 46 was set in order to include influenza sequence hits belonging to the same virus type and exclude hits from other influenza types and other viruses. Conserved regions were also aligned using CLUSTAL W 1.83 and were analysed with ConSort \u00a9 . During this process, a few new influenza A variants with mismatches occurring at the 3 end of both forward and reverse influenza A primers were found in GenBank. We then tested the primers with and without these 3 nucleotides (i.e., forward 5 GARRTYATAARRATGATGGA3 and 5 GARRTYATAARRATGATGG3 , and reverse 5 ATTGTCT-CCGAAGAAATAAGA3 and 5 ATTGTCTCCGAAGAAATAAG3 ). The C t values for 10 reference influenza A strains and ten clinical samples (H3N2) were the same, within half of a C t step (data not shown). We cannot state that the shorter primers will perform as well as the original, one-nucleotide longer primers for all of the samples. However, an equal mixture of shorter and longer primers at the same final primer concentration, as reported in Table 1 , also gave the same result. Thus, a safe way of handling this ambiguity seems to be using an equimolar mixture of the two primer variants for both forward and reverse primers. The primer sequences shown in Table 1 are the shorter variants.",

Molecular beacons (MBs) are singlestranded DNA probes that are useful for nucleic acid detection. MBs contain a fluorophore at the 5 end and a quencher at the 3 end and form a hairpin-like, stem-loop structure independently. The mismatch-tolerant of MegB is due to its long (55 nt) virus-specific sequence, which results in a high T m for virus-specific annealing. MegB is a modified MB with a stem-loop structure that has TaqMan \u00ae properties, i.e., it can be released by the 5 -3 exonuclease of the thermostable polymerase ( Fig. 2A) . MegB is not only complementary to the target sequence within the loop region, but it also has an additional 5 stem of 10 self-complementary nucleotides. Taq polymerase can degrade MegB and cleave the dual fluorescent dye-labelled MegB during PCR through its 5 -3 exonuclease activity. When the MegB is on its own, the quencher is bound to the fluorophore, and does not fluoresce below the T m of the stem. Both the quenching of uncleaved probe at \u223c70 \u2022 C and the consumption of probe during the amplification process due to exonuclease The correlation of residual fluorescence (\"probe consumption\") with amount of amplimer is evident and derives from cleaved probes as well as probes hybridising to amplimer. Negative samples occasionally gave an atypical amplification curve with the MegaBeacon influenza A probe. These curves could be discriminated from true positive amplification curves based on (i) curve form, if the curve started after a few cycles and remained low, (ii) if the sample was found to be negative in the probe consumption test and (iii) if the sample lacked a band of the expected size in agarose gel electrophoresis. All data were obtained using a Corbett Rotorgene \u00a9 instrument and its software.",

Three clinical samples that were positive for influenza A, B and C were titrated in 10-fold dilution steps for influenza A and C and in 2-fold dilution steps for influenza B down to complete negativity. An incomplete, stochastic, titration positivity (i.e., one to five positives per dilution step with six observations) at the last positive dilution step was observed for all three samples with 3QPCR-MegB. As expected, variation increased in the last two positive dilutions, just before the observed stochastic positivity in the last positive dilution. This result indicates that all three PCR assays have sensitivities of approximately 1-10 viral genomes per PCR reaction. The amplification efficiencies observed in the serial titrations of the three samples were 98, 92 and 96% for influenza A, B and C, respectively; illustrating that amplification from RNA has approximately the same efficiency as amplification from DNA in the two systems. However, it is likely that occasional mutations that compromise quantification can occur in practice. Absolute quantification can be somewhat erroneous. As stated above, we therefore prefer the term \"genome equivalents\". Using synthetic DNA as a standard in QPCR, the quantity of influenza RNA was shown to range from 10 to 10 7 influenza A, B and C genome equivalents per PCR reaction, which corresponds to around a 100-fold increase per ml of the nasopharyngeal specimens. No fluorescence signal was generated in the negative controls, which contained RNase-free water.",

            "text": "The great variability of orthomyxoviruses is a problem for sequence-based nucleic acid detection methods. Broadly targeted methods that utilize the most conserved portions of the virus genome are needed. NP and matrix genes are conserved within, but not between, influenza types. A widely used, broadly targeted system for influenza A detection uses the matrix protein gene (Fouchier et al., 2000; Kuiken et al., 2003; Whiley and Sloots, 2005) . However, the high variability of influenza, which includes the frequent emergence of radically new variants such as the avian and swine influenzas, makes it important to have alternative broadly targeted PCR assays. As shown here, the NP gene is also relatively conserved, somewhat more so than the matrix gene for influenza B and C. In an analysis of conservation of influenza A genes (Obenauer et al., 2006) , the nucleoprotein gene was among the more conserved genes; it had 1.81-1.85 variants per nucleotide position. The relative conservation of NP makes it a good choice for PCRs that cover a wide range of targets. In addition, influenza types A, B and C are based on the antigenicity of the NP gene, and it is, therefore, logical to detect and simultaneously type the three influenza types using NP as a target. The NP gene forms a complex with the polymerase subunits, which is necessary for RNA replication, and is probably conserved for similar reasons as the polymerase subunits. NP has been previously used for conventional PCR (Shu et al., 1993) . However, our 3QPCR-MegB technique is unique in that it was optimised from a large sequence base of human and animal viruses in order to facilitate broad detection. In addition, its primers and probes were optimised to allow for simultaneous detection of a broad range of the three influenza types. A disadvantage of the high sequence conservation is that the NP amplimers are of limited use for molecular epidemiology. If further characterisation is needed, hemagglutinin PCR assays should be performed (Lu et al., 2005) .",

            "text": "Target sequence variability is a significant problem for probebased detection of orthomyxoviruses, but also of caliciviruses, retroviruses and flaviviruses. The increased fault tolerance of the MegB strategy has the potential to improve detection of variable viruses in general and to enable detection of entire virus families, such as Coronaviridae (Muradrasoli et al., in preparation) . The basis of the MegB strategy is to extend the length of the probe to increase its T m and to disperse hybridisation over a longer nucleotide stretch, encompassing variation in the entire region. As long as there are sufficient perfectly matching sequence regions, the probe will bind. This concept differs from the T m -increasing LNA or Minor Groove Binding (MGB) oligonucleotide modifications, which increase the T m of short probes that target conserved stretches, but remain sensitive to mismatches within those stretches. MegB differs from a traditional MB in that it also functions as a nucleasedegradable probe, like TaqMan \u00ae probes. This quality allows for a gradual accumulation of free fluorophore during amplification, thus enhancing the fluorescence signal. The signal from open MegB probes, which were bound to amplimers, but not degraded by the 5 exonuclease activity of the polymerase, will be added to the total signal from the MegB probes. To ensure degradability of the 5 end of MegB, the 5 end should bind to a perfectly matching target sequence. We have placed LNA in this MegB region, which also ensures hybridisation of the 5 end to its complementary 3 end at temperatures below the hairpin T m when MegB is not bound to amplimer. Thus, MegB is a hybrid between a MB and a TaqMan \u00ae . MegB probes can be much longer than traditional TaqMan \u00ae probes because the former do not rely on an intact oligonucleotide chain for FRET. Instead, FRET is delivered by the proximity of the 5 and 3 ends in the hairpin. Judging from theoretical predictions and from the model experiments shown here, the influenza A MegB probe should be able to detect most influenza A strains with an upper limit of 10 evenly spaced mismatches. An alternative design could be a partially double-stranded probe in which the quencher is situated on the strand opposite to the reporter (Huang et al., 2007) .",

The proper role of LNA in diagnostic oligonucleotide design needs to be further defined. In our case, the introduction of LNA in theMegB influenza A and the influenza C probes allowed for the shortening of the probe in spite of maintaining a relatively high T m . Normally, TaqMan \u00ae probes are around 30 nucleotides long. The use of LNA allowed us to focus the probe on a shorter (A: 25 nt; InflAprobe, see Supplementary Material, C: 22 nt), highly conserved NP region than for InflBprobe (which was 31 nt long), avoiding the more variable flanks. It is reasonable to assume that introduction of LNA nucleotide(s) surrounding a mismatch site could increase fault tolerance and allow for shortening of the TaqMan \u00ae probe, which is desirable for good-quality quenching, i.e., a close distance between the fluorophores. The influenza B probe was antisense to avoid 5 G quenching. These versions gave a higher signal than the sense version of the same target sequence. As demonstrated here, the probes showed a remarkable tolerance to mismatches. The MegB influenza A probe was tested with and without LNA in the stem. These three LNA residues were necessary to generate a good signal. We cannot presently distinguish between possible better quenching of the LNA-containing version, higher 5 degradability, or better binding to the amplimer as causes of this effect.",

However, in the case of the highly variable influenza A, this fault tolerance did not prove to be enough. As discussed above, the influenza A MegB probe tolerated up to 10 mismatches, i.e., the entire recorded variation in the probe region. Evidently, the longer MegB length invited more possible mismatches than the shorter TaqMan \u00ae probes. However, it is unlikely that all possible mismatches would occur simultaneously in a wild-type virus. Therefore, the long MegB probe is more suitable to tolerate unanticipated variation than the shorter TaqMan \u00ae probes. More systematic tests of probe designs with LNA and the MegB principle are needed in order to encompass an even higher number of mismatches.",

PCR is an important tool in the diagnosis of influenza infections. Rapid, diagnostic, antigen-based methods are the first line of tests used for clinical management.
