The syndrome is characterized by rapid onset of fever, hypotension, and multisystem failure with desquamating rash occurring in convalescence [4] .

In contrast, STSS has no menstrual association, is more common at extremes of age and is a much more lethal condition compared to TSS with case fatality rates of approximately 50 % as compared to 5 -10 % respectively [5, 10 -14] . STSS is occasionally associated with the severe soft tissue infection necrotizing fasciitis, which has been popularly called \"flesh eating disease\" by the media [15] .",

Since the mid 1980s rates of NMTSS have been similar to those for MTSS. The overall incidence of TSS has been less well documented since the late 1980s but rates did not evidently increase for years after until just recently when an increase in cases was noted in the Minneapolis-St. Paul (Twin Cities) area in the United States [24, 25] . The case fatality rate for TSS is lowest for vaginally associated disease in young females under 15 years old (2 %) and highest in men (17 %) and non-vaginally associated cases in women (13 %) over 45 years old [26] .",

The global burden of invasive GAS disease is estimated at more than 600,000 cases yearly with rates dramatically higher in less developed countries [27] .

Skin trauma or breakdown is observed as a preceding event to invasive GAS disease in approximately one-third of cases but the relative risk associated with this is unknown.

The evidence supporting a toxic pathogenesis in TSS includes the clinical findings of multisystem involvement in the absence of systemic infection (positive blood cultures in less than 10 % of cases) and the ability to reproduce a TSS-like illness in rabbits using purified S. aureus toxins [5, 31, 32] . There is strong evidence implicating toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) and the staphylococcal enterotoxins as the etiologic agents of TSS [33] . TSST-1 was identified independently by Bergdoll et al. and Schlievert et al. in 1981 and its role in TSS is widely accepted [34, 35] . This protein is produced by over 90 % of MTSS isolates and the majority of NMTSS isolates [33, 35] . The staphylococcal enterotoxins are commonly co-produced with TSST-1 and are likely responsible for the syndrome in non-TSST-1 producing isolates from TSS cases [33, 36] . Staphylococcal enterotoxin B is produced by the majority of NMTSS isolates in which TSST-1 is not produced and is likely the cause of the disease in these cases [5, 36 -38] . TSST-1 negative TSS has a higher case-fatality rate which may reflect the higher rate of co-morbid medical conditions typical of NMTSS patients or the different toxins mediating the illness [33] .",

Retrospective studies have identified that S. aureus has had the ability to produce TSST-1 since at least the 1950s [39] . The onset of MTSS in the 1980s appears to be closely related to the use of superabsorbent tampons, as these products probably increase the risk of MTSS by altering the vaginal milieu to encourage S. aureus colonization and promote toxin production. In vitro studies of TSST-1 expression by S. aureus have identified that production is highly variable according to the environment and that an aerobic, pH neutral, low magnesium environment optimizes toxin production [40] . Tampons may increase the risk of TSS by promoting these conditions. A recent study conducted in North America found that colonization by TSST-1 producing S. aureus strains was common in young women and that most had neutralizing titers of antibodies [41] . It is less clear which factors have been involved in the development of NMTSS. It is possible that this condition has been present at a low baseline rate for many years but not widely identified until surveillance for MTSS brought it to attention. MTSS and NMTSS appear to be distinct microbiologically as one clone appears to be responsible for the majority of cases of MTSS whereas isolates from NMTSS are heterogeneous [42] .",

In the usual cell mediated immune response, T cells recognize antigen presented by the major histocompatibility complex II positive antigen presenting cells with high specificity. The population of T cells that respond are selected based on the specificity of their T cell receptor, which is determined by the combination of the variable gene segments V [ , V q , J [ , J q , and D q [43] . However, superantigens bypass the usual antigen presenting process and activate T cells based on V q specificity alone [43, 46] . This leads to a relatively non-specific activation of large populations of T cells. For instance, TSST-1 is V q 2 restricted and may stimulate up to 50 % of all T cells [47] . The result of this activation is the release of potent mediators of inflammation including interleukins 1 and 6 and tumor necrosis factor, which ultimately lead to the clinical manifestations of TSS.",

Unlike in TSS where systemic effects are observed typically in association with a localized infection, STSS is characterized by severe bacteremic infection typically in with a rapidly progressive local focus of disease. No single factor has been identified that enables S. pyogenes to aggressively invade tissue but potential virulence determinants include M proteins and enzymes such as streptokinase, hyaluronidase, deoxyribonucleases, and proteinases [49] . Although there is a broad range of M protein types observed with severe GAS disease, M1 and M3 have been observed to occur at higher rates with invasive infection [28, 50] .

The diagnosis of TSS requires a high index of suspicion because it is a clinical diagnosis having no single diagnostic test and the infection source is often mild or clinically not readily evident. The diagnosis of TSS does not necessarily require isolation of S. aureus although most cases will have evidence of this infection. STSS is usually easier to diagnose than TSS because of the usually fulminant illness and high rate of blood culture positivity (> 90 %) in this condition [10] . However, the early presentation of patients who later develop STSS is often non-specific and delays in diagnosis and treatment are not uncommon. Unlike in TSS where the causative agent does not need to be isolated, the definition of STSS requires the isolation of GAS from the patient [4, 9] .",

The myocardial dysfunction when it occurs demonstrates the picture of a reversible toxic cardiomyopathy or myocarditis. The shock state commonly leads to renal impairment from pre-renal failure or acute tubular necrosis [59] . Electrolyte abnormalities are non-specific and may include low serum calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, and phosphate. The elevated transaminase and bilirubin levels commonly observed are most likely related to shock liver. Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is more common in STSS but may also occur in TSS.

This diagnosis may also be made if tissue necrosis is evident clinically or at surgical exploration. Necrotizing fasciitis is a rapidly progressive infection that is often difficult to diagnose clinically. In the early stages there may be necrosis of the underlying fascia despite normal overlying skin. Clues to the diagnosis include pain out of proportion to physical findings, edema, and/or erythema in the setting of symptoms and signs of infection including fever, arthralgias, and myalgias [62] . Rapid changes in clinical findings are particularly worrisome for this diagnosis. Creatine kinase levels are often elevated but this test is both insensitive and non-specific and therefore inadequate to rule out necrotizing fasciitis. Soft tissue radiograms rarely show air in tissue in necrotizing fasciitis due to GAS and are unhelpful to exclude this diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging has been proposed as a test to diagnose necrotizing fasciitis but performance of this test should not delay definitive diagnosis by sur-gical exploration and biopsy which is the standard of care [62] . Since no symptom, sign, or non-invasive investigation reliably rules out a diagnosis of potentially limb or life-threatening necrotizing fasciitis, surgical exploration should be performed in all cases for which the diagnosis is entertained. The procedure has minimal morbidity but a missed or delayed diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis has very serious and often lethal consequences.",

Antibiotics for TSS are most important for preventing relapse in MTSS but are usually also needed to treat the local infection in NMTSS [73] . Prompt use of antibiotics in STSS is critical because this is nearly always a systemic infection. S. aureus is usually resistant to penicillin and in some regions it is commonly methicillin resistant. S. pyogenes is universally susceptible to penicillin. However, even if in vitro susceptible, in TSS and STSS beta-lactam antibiotics may be limited in treatment because of the \"inoculum effect\" [74] . This occurs when the bacteria are present in high concentrations and are in stationary phase with the subsequent reduced production of penicillin binding proteins, the target of beta-lactam antibiotics. Clindamycin is a protein synthesis inhibitor antibiotic that has in vitro activity against both S. aureus and S. pyogenes. It is not affected by the inoculum effect and also may treat toxic shock by inhibiting toxin production [75] . Clindamycin has been shown to be more effective than penicillin in mouse models of GAS myositis and in case-control studies in humans with STSS [76] . Our recommendations are that high doses of clindamycin should be used with a penicillinase resistant penicillin in TSS, and with penicillin in STSS unless susceptibility testing demonstrates resistance. Since in many cases it is difficult to differentiate among TSS, STSS, and Gramnegative septic shock in the initial presentation, clindamycin should be used with a broad spectrum, q -lactamase resistant agent until microbiologic diagnosis is achieved. In regions where MRSA is a concern, vancomycin or linezolid should be added to this empiric regimen.",

Intravenous immunoglobulin contains neutralizing antibodies to staphylococcal and streptococcal superantigens and has anti-cytokine ac-tivity [15, 79, 80] . Although there is rationale for IVIG use in these syndromes based in theory, several lines of laboratory investigation, and retrospective clinical series, no definitive clinical trial has been conducted and there remains clinical equipoise as to whether IVIG should be used in the treatment of TSS and STSS [81] . One prospective, randomized control comparing IVIG and placebo in the treatment of STSS has been reported [82] . However, this study was ended prematurely after enrolling only 21 patients and as a result was underpowered to detect any significant mortality difference. We recommend the use of IVIG as an adjunctive therapy for STSS and TSS where the disease presentation is particularly severe or rapidly progressive despite prompt institution of other recommended therapies. In children with TSS or STSS it is important to exclude Kawasaki disease as this condition shares many features with toxic shock and may be diagnosed simultaneously [63] . If there are clinical criteria for Kawasaki disease or evidence of coronary involvement then IVIG is clearly indicated based on its proven efficacy in reducing the risk of developing coronary aneurysms from 23 % to 2 % [83] . Echocardiography is the screening procedure of choice to detect coronary aneurysms and it is our recommendation that this test is performed on all children with TSS or STSS.",

If these products are used then the absorbency and amount of time they are left in place may best be minimized [25] . Risks for NMTSS may be reduced by careful wound care and prompt treatment of infection in surgical cases. Recurrence is common in TSS and there may be a role for eliminating S. aureus asymptomatic carriage in the nares using topical mupirocin [2, 84] . Invasive GAS disease has an estimated household contact transmission risk of 3 per 1,000 that is comparable to rates observed for meningococcal disease [10] . Antibiotic prophylaxis for close contacts of patients with STSS may be beneficial but the best way to approach this issue remains to be defined [85, 86] . In children, 16 % of all cases of invasive GAS disease are complications of varicella infection and it has been estimated that 10 % of all invasive GAS in children would be prevented by routine vaccination for varicella at 1 year of age [13] .",
