The challenge in any less invasive method is that the nasal mucosa is heavily colonized with normal bacterial fl ora. Cultures of the middle meatus obtained by the use of an endoscope have been used as a surrogate for sinus aspiration. The maxillary, frontal, and anterior air cells of the ethmoid sinuses drain into the middle meatus via the osteomeatal complex. The endoscope is inserted into the nose, and a sample is obtained from material in the middle meatus via a swab or aspiration. The mucosa of the anterior nares must be disinfected, and meticulous care must be taken to be sure the endoscope does not touch the nasal vestibule and become contaminated. Benninger et al. performed a meta-analysis of studies in a mainly adult population comparing endoscopically obtained cultures of the middle meatus to maxillary sinus puncture [ 5 ] . When all bacterial isolates are considered, endoscopically obtained cultures show a sensitivity of 80 %, specifi city of 70 %, positive predictive value of 78 %, negative predictive value of 75 %, and an overall accuracy of 76 % when compared with maxillary sinus aspiration. If only the sinus pathogens S. pneumoniae , H. infl uenzae , and M. catarrhalis are taken into account, the test performs somewhat better with a sensitivity and specifi city of 81 and 83 %, positive and negative predictive value of 91 and 89 %, and overall accuracy of 87 %. Given that the caliber of the nasal passage in children is signifi cantly smaller than adults, one might expect a greater rate of contamination of endoscopically obtained cultures when this procedure is performed in children. Hsin et al. compared endoscopic middle meatal cultures to maxillary sinus puncture in children 2-12 years with subacute and chronic sinusitis [ 6 ] .

In the absence of high-quality data from sinus aspirates, important information may be learned from cultures of middle ear aspirates in children with acute otitis media (AOM). AOM may be used as a surrogate for sinusitis as the middle ear is, in fact, a paranasal sinus [ 19 ] . The anatomy and physiology of the middle ear are very similar to that of the sinuses. The middle ear drains via the Eustachian tube into the nasopharynx, analogous to sinus drainage via the osteomeatal complex into the nose. A viral upper respiratory infection is often the predisposing factor for both of these infections causing impairment of drainage with subsequent bacterial growth and infl ammation.

Further assessment of this microbiological shift will be important as the use of PCV-13 becomes more widespread. Overall, we can anticipate that the prevalence of S. pneumoniae will continue to decrease and H. infl uenzae increase as the causative organism in children with AOM in the United States. It is likely the same phenomenon is occurring with acute bacterial sinusitis, since the source of the pathogens in both diseases is ultimately the nasopharynx.

Thus, an understanding of the viral epidemiology of sinusitis may lead to methods to prevent this infection. Once again using the analogy of AOM is useful in understanding what is occurring during episodes of sinusitis.

They are more resistant to the effects of antibiotics than free-fl oating planktonic bacteria. This is accomplished by several mechanisms: (1) greater cell-cell contact to facilitate plasmid exchange for the evolution of resistance, (2) production of beta-lactamases, (3) slow bacterial growth resulting in decreased effect of antibiotics that rely on cell growth and turnover for killing effect, and (4) the presence of \"persister\" cells that reform the biofi lm when the antibiotic is discontinued [ 50 ] .

Thus, selecting an antimicrobial that is beta-lactamase stable or has a beta-lactamase inhibitor is important in treating children with sinusitis. Future studies that address methods of noninvasively detecting bacteria in the sinus would be helpful so that changes in the microbiology may be more readily monitored. Furthermore, additional research is needed to explore the role of viruses in the pathogenesis of AOM in children.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Bacteriology of the maxillary sinus of rhesus monkeys", "authors": [{"first": "E", "middle": ["D"], "last": "Shapiro", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "E", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Wald", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "W", "middle": [], "last": "Doyle", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": [], "last": "Rohn", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1982, "venue": "Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol", "volume": "91", "issn": "", "pages": "150--151", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Sinusitis of the maxillary antrum", "authors": [{"first": "F", "middle": ["O"], "last": "Evans", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["B"], "last": "Sydnor", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "W", "middle": ["E"], "last": "Moore", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1975, "venue": "N Engl J Med", "volume": "293", "issn": "", "pages": "735--744", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Acute maxillary sinusitis in children", "authors": [{"first": "E", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Wald", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Milmoe", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Bowen", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Ledesma-Medina", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "N", "middle": [], "last": "Salamon", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": ["D"], "last": "Bluestone", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1981, "venue": "N Engl J Med", "volume": "304", "issn": "", "pages": "749--54", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Treatment of acute maxillary sinusitis in childhood: a comparative study of amoxicillin and cefaclor", "authors": [{"first": "E", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Wald", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Reilly", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Casselbrant", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1984, "venue": "J Pediatr", "volume": "104", "issn": "", "pages": "297--302", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "Endoscopically directed middle meatal cultures versus maxillary sinus taps in acute bacterial maxillary rhinosinusitis: a meta-analysis", "authors": [{"first": "M", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Benninger", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": ["C"], "last": "Payne", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "B", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Ferguson", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Hadley", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "N", "middle": [], "last": "Ahmad", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2006, "venue": "Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg", "volume": "134", "issn": "", "pages": "3--9", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF5": {"ref_id": "b5", "title": "Comparison of maxillary sinus puncture with endoscopic middle meatal culture in pediatric rhinosinusitis", "authors": [{"first": "C", "middle": ["H"], "last": "Hsin", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": ["H"], "last": "Tsao", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["C"], "last": "Su", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["C"], "last": "Chou", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Liu", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2008, "venue": "Am J Rhinol", "volume": "22", "issn": "", "pages": "280--284", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF6": {"ref_id": "b6", "title": "Maxillary sinus puncture and culture in the diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis: the case for pursuing alternative culture methods", "authors": [{"first": "M", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Benninger", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": ["C"], "last": "Appelbaum", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["C"], "last": "Denneny", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Osguthorpe", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Stankiewicz", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2002, "venue": "Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg", "volume": "127", "issn": "", "pages": "7--12", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF7": {"ref_id": "b7", "title": "Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Infections of the Sinuses", "authors": [{"first": "I", "middle": [], "last": "Brook", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2008, "venue": "Curr Infect Dis Rep", "volume": "10", "issn": "", "pages": "180--181", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF8": {"ref_id": "b8", "title": "Staphylococcus aureus is a major pathogen in acute bacterial rhinosinusitis: a meta-analysis", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": ["C"], "last": "Payne", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Benninger", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2007, "venue": "Clin Infect Dis", "volume": "45", "issn": "", "pages": "121--128", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF9": {"ref_id": "b9", "title": "Sub committee on management of sinusitis and committee on Quality Improvement.

Two studies have compared the relative rates of isolation of otitis pathogens before and after the introduction of PCV-7 in 2000 for universal immunization in the United States. Block et al. performed tympanocentesis on 381 children aged 7-24 months with otitis media in a practice setting in rural Kentucky [ 20 ]. After the introduction of PCV-7, the rate of isolation of S. pneumoniae decreased signifi cantly from 48 to 21 % of all isolates. Meanwhile, H. infl uenzae was isolated more frequently during this time period, shifting from 41 to 56 % of isolates. The rate of isolation of Moraxella was not changed in this study. In the second study, covering the period from 1995 to 2003, Casey et al. cultured middle ear fl uid obtained from children who had failed treatment for AOM or had persistent AOM [ 21 ]. During this time period, the rate of isolation of S. pneumoniae decreased from 48 to 31 %, H. infl uenzae increased from 38 to 57 %, and Moraxella did not change. This same group, however, found a near reversal of this trend between 2007 and 2009 (before the introduction of the 13-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine in 2010). During this time frame, S. pneumoniae and H. infl uenzae were isolated 44 and 41 % of the time from middle ear fl uid", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": ".1 Bacteriology of acute sinusitis in 79 sinus aspirates in 50 children with acute sinusitis based on sinus puncture[ 3 , 4 ]", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Rate of isolation of pathogens from middle ear fl uid in children with acute otitis media before and after the introduction of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7)", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td> S. pneumoniae </td><td> H. infl uenzae </td><td>\u00a0</td><td> M. catarrhalis </td></tr><tr><td> Study </td><td> Pre-PCV-7 </td><td> Post-PCV-7 </td><td> Pre-PCV-7 </td><td> Post-PCV-7 </td><td> Pre-PCV-7 </td><td> Post-PCV-7 </td></tr><tr><td> Block, 2004 [ 20 ] </td><td> 48 </td><td> 31 </td><td> 41 </td><td> 56 </td><td> 9 </td><td> 11 </td></tr><tr><td> Casey, 2004 [ 21 ] </td><td> 48 </td><td> 31 </td><td> 38 </td><td> 57 </td><td> 4 </td><td> 1 </td></tr><tr><td> Kaur , 2010 [ 51 ] </td><td> - </td><td> 25 </td><td> - </td><td> 35 </td><td> - </td><td> 9 </td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF2": {"text": "", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF3": {"text": "Microbiology of the orbital and intracranial complications of sinusitis", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td> Orbital (125 isolates) </td><td> Intracranial (142 isolates) </td></tr><tr><td> Gram positive </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td> S. aureus </td><td> 58 </td><td> 6 </td></tr><tr><td> S. pneumoniae </td><td> 2 </td><td> 4 </td></tr><tr><td> S. anginosus </td><td> 4 </td><td> 49 </td></tr><tr><td> S. pyogenes </td><td> 9 </td><td> 9 </td></tr><tr><td> Other \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci </td><td> 1 </td><td> 4 </td></tr><tr><td> Other \u03b1-hemolytic streptococci </td><td> 14 </td><td> 20 </td></tr><tr><td> Coagulase-negative staphylococci </td><td> 4 </td><td> 12 </td></tr><tr><td> Other gram positive </td><td>\u00a0</td><td> 1 </td></tr><tr><td> Gram negative </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td> Enteric gram-negative rods </td><td> 9 </td><td> 5 </td></tr><tr><td> NTHi </td><td> 6 </td><td> 2 </td></tr><tr><td> Other Haemophilus spp. </td><td> 2 </td><td> 1 </td></tr><tr><td> M. catarrhalis </td><td>\u00a0</td><td> 1 </td></tr><tr><td> Neisseria spp . </td><td> 2 </td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td> Anaerobes </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td> Bacteroides spp. </td><td> 1 </td><td> 6 </td></tr><tr><td> Eikenella spp. </td><td> 3 </td><td> 2 </td></tr><tr><td> Fusobacterium spp. </td><td> 3 </td><td> 3 </td></tr><tr><td> Peptostreptococcus </td><td> 3 </td><td> 6 </td></tr><tr><td> Prevotella </td><td> 1 </td><td> 2 </td></tr><tr><td> Other </td><td> 3 </td><td> 9 </td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td> From Refs.
