            "text": "The Main protease (Mpro) also known as 3-C like protease (3CLpro) received great attention because of its important role in post-translational processing of replicase polyproteins (Boopathi et al., 2020; Elmezayen et al., 2020; Khan, Jha, et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2016). The enzymatic activity of this protein leads to processing of viral polyproteins. The \u223c306 amino acid long main protease has high structural and sequence similarity to that of SARS-CoV 3CLpro (Liu & Wang, 2020). The SARS-CoV-2 Main protease (Mpro) monomer consists of N-terminal domain-I, N-terminal domain-II, and C-terminal domain-III (Mirza & Froeyen, 2020). The active site of enzyme contains a catalytic dyad having Cys145 and His41 (Bacha et al., 2004; Khan, Zia, et al., 2020). HIV drugs including lopinavir and ritonavir have been explored recently against MERS-CoV (Sheahan et al., 2020). In addition, peptidomimetic \u03b1-ketoamides were designed and synthesized to test their performance against the main proteases of betacoronaviruses, alphacoronaviruses, and the 3CLpro of enteroviruses. In a recent follow-up study, Zhang et al. resolved the crystal structure of Mpro complex of SARS-CoV-2 with modified \u03b1-ketoamide inhibitors (Zhang et al., 2020). After the outbreak, several types of drugs alone or with combination have been using in many countries (Colson et al., 2020; Gautret et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). However, still there is no definite antiviral drug to fight against the deadly virus.",

Herein, we have selected 40 known phytochemicals isolated from natural herbs and fruits. These phytochemicals have already showed antiviral activity against different viruses. The aim of this study is to explore and identify the binding affinities and interactions of these antiviral phytochemicals against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 using computational and statistical tools. Molecular docking, molecular dynamics, principal component analysis (PCA), and quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) are performed to assess the performance of these phytochemicals. In addition, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion properties of the best candidates are evaluated.",

Optimization of the phytochemicals and calculation of vibrational frequency were performed using Gaussian 09 software package (Frisch et al., 2009). The structure of the phytochemicals was optimized at semi-empirical PM6 method (Stewart, 2007). The crystal structure of the main protease was taken from the RSCB Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 6LU7). Then the crystal structure of the protease was optimized and checked by Swiss-PDB viewer software packages (version 4.1.0) based on their least energy. Some significant factors, such as improper bond order, side chain geometry, and missing hydrogen, were observed in the crystal structure of the protease. PyMol (version 1.1) software package was used to erase all the hetero atoms, water molecules, and inhibitor present in the structure (DeLano, 2002). Finally, the non-covalent interaction of phytochemicals-protease was calculated using Autodock Vina software package for the docking analysis (Trott & Olson, 2009). Using this method, binding affinities of ligand-protease were determined and reported in kcal/mol unit. The grid box in Autodock Vina was generated targeting the active site of the main protease, where the center was at X: \u221211.76, Y: 15.17, Z: 69.19 and the dimensions of the grid box were, X: 25.22, Y: 29.33 and Z: 29.22 (unit of the dimensions, \u00c5). To get more insights of these results, GOLD (Jones et al., 1997) docking program was also employed.",

In this study, MD simulation was conducted by YASARA Dynamics software (Krieger et al., 2012). The AMBER14 force field was employed for this study to describe the macromolecular system (Dickson et al., 2014). Water and Na+/Cl- ions were also added to the system. Periodic boundary condition was incorporated to perform the simulation, where the cell size was 20 \u00c5 larger than the protease size in all cases. By employing steepest gradient approach (5000 cycles), the initial energy minimization for each system was performed. MD simulations were performed using the PME method to designate long-range electrostatic interactions at a cut off distance of 8 \u00c5, and defining physiological conditions at 310 K, pH 7.4, 0.9% NaCl (Krieger et al., 2006). The simulation temperature was controlled using the Berendsen thermostat, where the pressure kept constant throughout the simulation. A multiple time step algorithm was employed, where the simulation time step was selected as 1.25 fs (Krieger & Vriend, 2015). Finally, MD simulation was performed for 100 ns long and snapshots were saved at every 100 ps into MD trajectory for further analysis. Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg), solvent accessible surface area (SASA), and total number of H-bond count were calculated from the MD simulations similar to other studies (Elfiky & Azzam, 2020; Enayatkhani et al., 2020; Muralidharan et al., 2020; Pant et al., 2020).",

Interestingly, cyanidin 3-glucoside complex shows quite similar fluctuations from 60 to 100 ns as exhibited by \u03b1-ketoamide-11r complex. It signifies its SASA mediated behavior as it is also observed by \u03b1-ketoamide-11r complex. Although the SASA of glabridin complex is observed in the median till 46 ns compared to other complexes as described earlier, the fluctuations are quite irregular from 66 to 78 ns. The average SASA value of all systems are 14160.7, 13985.1, 14209.3, 14039.9, 13958.4, and 13955.1 for apo-protein, \u03b1-ketoamide-11r, baicalin, cyanidin 3-glucoside, glabridin, and hypericin, respectively.

Besides, the Rg of \u03b1-ketoamide-11r is increased from 22 to 95.6 ns (average Rg \u223c 22.82). The greater change of Rg might be the result of protein folding, or unique conformational changes.

In case of cyanidin 3-glucoside complex, the lowest Rg value is observed from 80 to 100 ns, which indicates greater rigidness in contrast to the other complexes. Besides, the glabridin complex seems to have lowest Rg corresponding to its highest rigidity from 0 to 40 ns and 63 ns to 77 ns. The Rg value of hypericin is much higher after 20 ns (average Rg \u223c 23.16) indicating its slackness of packing compared to all other complexes.

On the other hand, in the test set L27 (Figure 5b) reveals the lowest standardized residuals may be the presence of hetero N, S, and O atoms. L33 exhibits a high standardized residual may be due to the large asymmetric molecule and their conformational change. The lowest standardized residual indicates that the predicted binding energies have close agreement to the binding energies obtained by molecular docking. The predicted QSAR binding energies and the docking binding energies obtained from the ligands with similar SAR typically have similar chemical reactivity, pharmacological activity, behavior, and efficacy.

It is observed that hypericin, cyanidin 3-glucoside, baicalin, glabridin, and \u03b1-ketoamide-11r could be used as potential inhibitors for the main protease. Hypericin shows the highest binding affinity of \u221210.7 kcal/mol and forms a pi-alkyl interaction with the catalytic binding residue Cys145.

All the top scored phytochemicals demonstrate strong noncovalent interactions with the binding site residues. More specifically, the selected five phytochemicals form non-covalent interactions with both the two (Cys145 and His41) or at least one of the catalytic residues, and thereby can act as inhibitors of the main protease.

MD results show that in the physiological environment, baicalin, cyanidin 3-glucoside, and \u03b1-ketoamide-11r are the most stable ligands and they are making a greater number of interactions through hydrogen bonds with the main protease. Pharmacokinetic and ADMET analysis indicate their efficacy as drug molecules. PCA of QSAR results show that the ligands, e.g. L6, L7, L12, L15, L16, L22, and L25 containing -OH, -COOH, and C = O functional groups attached to their benzene ring are grouped together in the first and second quadrants of the score plot.

Therefore, PCA analysis successfully divides the studied phytochemicals into two groups. The MLR model calculates the value of R2, which is 0.842 for the training set and 0.753 for the test set.
