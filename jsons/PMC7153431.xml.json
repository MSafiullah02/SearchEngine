Breath sounds were diminished in intensity without adventitious sounds. Chest radiographs showed reticular interstitial opacities (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this case at NEJM.org). Laboratory tests (Table 1) were unremarkable except for lymphopenia, which has been reported to occur in patients with Covid-19.1 A nonstress test confirmed a reactive fetal heart rate, and ultrasonographic evaluation revealed a normal singleton pregnancy. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were obtained to test for influenza, Covid-19, and other respiratory viral infections; all tests except Covid-19 were negative within 6 hours. The patient was admitted to a private regular hospital room.",

During her labor course, tests for Covid-19 were determined to be positive 21 hours after samples were obtained. Other than a transient temperature increase to 38.5\u00b0C just before delivery, which resolved without treatment, she had an uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery on hospital day 3, with Apgar scores of 8 and 9. Delayed cord clamping was not performed, and skin-to-skin contact between the mother and infant was not permitted. There was no evidence of neonatal or intraamniotic infection. After delivery, the neonate was placed in a radiant warmer bed away from the mother and was moved to a separate room once the condition was stabilized, to remain there until discharge. The neonate was nourished with formula and expressed breast milk.",
