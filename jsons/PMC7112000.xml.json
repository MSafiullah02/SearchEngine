However, growth\nof pullets can be reduced by infectious diseases (Yegani and Korver, 2008) and all ages and physiological stages require a strong,\nfunctional immune system to protect against pathogens. At hatch, the immune system is not\nwell developed and it matures with age: the lymphoid organs and tissues increase in size\nreaching their maxima before or soon after pullets become sexually mature (Ciriaco et al.,\n2003; Rodr\u00edguez-M\u00e9ndez et al., 2010; Ol\u00e1h et al., 2014). However, there is variation in the maximum sizes and rates of development\nand involution of the immune organs among different strains and breeds of poultry (Zhang\net al., 2006).",

(2016)\nshowed that supplementing the diet of layer pullets aged 8 to 18 wk with a lower\nconcentration (1 g/100 g diet) of the same IF product as used here (Arbocel RC Fine), did\nnot result in an increase in live BW either after 5 or 10 wk of feeding the supplemented\ndiet. Thus, the age at which dietary supplements are given and the dietary fiber\nconcentration and chemical composition can be important if BW is to be improved. Other\nresearchers have found that fiber supplements can improve BW gain in layer strain\nchickens. Guzm\u00e1n et al. (2015) found, in younger\nlayer pullets than used here (from hatching to 5 wk-of-age), that inclusion in the diet of\n2 or 4% cereal straw as IF or sugar beet pulp as MF, slightly increased average daily\ngain. Incharoen and Maneechote (2013) showed that\nBW of similar aged (4 to 8 wk) layer pullets of a different strain, H and N Brown Nick,\nwas significantly increased as a result of including 3 or 6% whole rice hulls as IF in the\nfeed. Fiber has also been shown to have beneficial effects on weight gain of meat-type\npoultry (eg Bogus\u0142awska-Tryk, 2005;\nGonz\u00e1lez-Alvarado et al., 2010; Sarikhan et al.,\n2010).",

The development of the spleen can be influenced by both the bursa (Glick and\nDreesen, 1967; Heller and Perek, 1973) and the thymus glands (Hoshi and Mori, 1973) and it is possible that the larger size in the\nyoung pullets in Experiment 1 could be associated with the significantly larger bursal and\nthymus weights (Table 2).

A slowing of\ngrowth rate and involution at about 12 to 16 wk-of-age occurs in the thymus gland (Ciriaco\net al., 2003; Ol\u00e1h et al., 2014) and in the older pullets in Experiment 2, the thymus glands in\nGroup IF were not significantly heavier than those of Control or MF group pullets\n(Table 3).

(2005) who showed that\nfeeding purified \u03b2-glucan to day old White Leghorn male chicks for 4 days significantly\nincreased phagocytic ability of heterophils as well as oxidative burst. Similarly,\nMcReynolds et al. (2009) found that alfalfa,\nwhich is mainly composed of IF (Chen et al., 2013), enhanced oxidative burst production and degranulation of heterophils in\nlaying hens compared to those in an unfed group of hens during the molting period. The\nauthors suggested that this enhancement might be due to the long transit time of alfalfa\nin the gastrointestinal tract stimulating bacterial degradation of alfalfa cellulose into\nFOS and thereafter into fermentable substrates such as short chain fatty acids. These\ncompounds could then increase mucosal structure and functionality of the small and large\nintestines as well beneficially modifying bacterial content of the GIT. The results of the\ncurrent studies are consistent with outcomes of studies in broiler chicks. Guo et al.\n(2003) showed that supplementing broiler\nchickens with \u03b2-1,3/1,6-glucan as IF for 4 wk improved macrophage (a component of innate\nimmune function) phagocytic activity. In a study by Vetvicka and Oliveira (2014) supplementing starter diets for 28 days with\n\u03b2-1,3/1,6-D-glucan significantly enhanced the ability of neutrophils (heterophils) of 28\nday old Leghorn chickens to phagocytose synthetic particles when compared to an\nun-supplemented control group.",

The products of degradation could in turn\ncontribute to decreasing digesta viscosity, accelerating small intestinal fermentation and\nincreasing the digestibility and availability of nutrients (Zhang et al., 2014). Increasing the viscosity of digesta as a\nresult of xylanase degradation of arabinoxylans will slow down its passage rate and\nsubsequently change the balance of microorganisms by increasing of the fermentative\nmicroflora thus producing great amounts of short chain fatty acids and lactic acid (Gao\net al., 2007).

Further study would be required to determine possible\nmodes of action of the different fiber types in eliciting beneficial effects on the immune\nsystem. Because of the wide variety of ingredients used experimentally to increase dietary\nfiber content across published experiments, and the variation in chemical structure of\nfibers in those diets it is not possible to derive specific recommendations regarding\neffective concentrations of different dietary fibers that will improve growth and immune\nfunctions. However, from the positive results described here, both types of commercial\ndietary lignocellulose fibers (MF and IF) and especially IF, might be useful alternatives\nto antibiotics for enhancement of growth and the innate, cell-mediated and gut associated\nimmune functions of 4 to 8 wk and 10 to 18 wk old pullets prior to egg laying.",
