We use a wildlife-pathogen system-prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) and the plague bacterium (Yersinia pestis)-to describe aspects of disease ecology that apply to many cases of emerging infectious disease. We show that the monitoring and surveillance of hosts and vectors during the buildup to disease outbreaks are crucial for understanding pathogen-transmission dynamics and that a community-ecology framework is important to identify reservoir hosts. Incorporating multidisciplinary approaches and frameworks may improve wildlife-pathogen surveillance and our understanding of seemingly sporadic and rare pathogen outbreaks.",

Zoonotic spillovers can be difficult to predict because they result from complex multifaceted ecological interactions and often exhibit patterns of sporadic epidemics that affect local host populations, interspersed by periods of \"disappearance\" into long-term quiescent phases of cryptic persistence in unknown reservoirs.

MERS-CoV was first discovered in a patient in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and has since infected more than 950 people globally, resulting in more than 350 deaths (Rasmussen et al. 2015) . Camels are believed to be the infectious source for humans, and retrospective antibody surveys indicate that the virus circulated in camels for a substantial time-at least 20 years-before MERS was identified in humans (e.g., Azhar et al. 2014 , Meyer et al. 2014 . But this type of pathogen discovery does not tell the whole story of spillover and zoonosis emergence. The 2014 Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa revealed that virus transmission can change from a local, rural, and rare zoonotic spillover to an urban epidemic with thousands of fatalities. With rapid international transport, several infected travelers died after transit from West Africa to other parts of the word, which demonstrates the potential of a worldwide epidemic. Although fruit bats have been touted as potential Ebola virus reservoirs, no consensus exists on the identity of the Ebola virus reservoir species or even of the natural history of the virus in putative wildlife hosts (Olival and Hayman 2014) . The ongoing MERS-CoV and Ebola virus outbreaks underscore the inherent difficulties in predicting the emergence, transmission, and sporadic outbreaks of zoonotic pathogens that persist in multihost systems but lack a clearly identified wildlife reservoir.",

Furthermore, control initiatives to protect public health from disease originating in wildlife may involve culling and other disruptions of wildlife (e.g., badger culling and bovine tuberculosis in the United Kingdom), which gives rise to controversies over the value of ecosystem function, protection, and environmental ethics. Ideally, to control or predict the size and frequency of outbreaks, we should understand how pathogens persist in the cryptic phase, and we need to identify and predict conditions that cause outbreaks. Persistence and outbreaks can be affected by rates of transmission that are influenced by multiple factors, such as rainfall and temperature, host and vector abundance, exposure rates, and host behavior. But not all hosts are equal: Pathogens often display broad host ranges, infecting multiple host species that vary in predisposition to infectiousness, susceptibility to disease, and modes of transmission (e.g., direct contact, vector borne, and environmental exposure). Detection of the pathogen can be difficult if incidence becomes so low that ongoing surveillance efforts cannot detect outbreaks without an increase in sampling efforts. Similarly, efforts to study pathogen ecology may be stymied by environments that present logistic challenges for field studies-for instance, subterranean burrows, marine environments, forest canopies, and cave networks-and therefore affect our ability to detect disease dynamics before a full-scale outbreak is underway.",

Plague is most famous for the Black Death that devastated human populations of medieval Europe beginning in 1347 and persisting with repeated outbreaks for four centuries. During the late nineteenth century, plague spread from its endemic range in Asia to Africa and the Americas, and outbreaks still cause hundreds of human cases annually, especially in Africa . Introduced into the United States circa 1900, Y. pestis is now established and affects wildlife populations throughout the western United States, with occasional spillover to humans (approximately 10 cases per year) and domestic animals (Antolin et al. 2002, Gage and .",

            "text": "On the Great Plains, plague sporadically erupts in outbreaks that decimate populations of black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus; hereafter, prairie dogs). Prairie dogs are diurnal, social ground squirrels (figure 1) that occupy spatially distinct colonies that can extend across several hundred hectares of grassland habitat. Within colonies, prairie dogs are organized into smaller social groups called coteries (1-2 adult males, 2-4 adult females, yearlings and juvenile offspring) that inhabit a well-developed burrow system within a territory that they defend from neighboring individuals (Hoogland 1995) . During plague outbreaks, it is common for 95%-100% of individuals in colonies to die, making plague the most important nonanthropogenic threat to prairie dog populations (Cully and Williams 2001 , Antolin et al. 2002 , Pauli et al. 2006 , whose abundance was already reduced (estimated as high as 90%) as a result of habitat loss and poisoning programs for agriculture and urban development. Plague's impact in altering the prairie ecosystem can be profound because prairie dogs are ecosystem engineers that modify the environment by their grazing and burrowing activities and thereby can create habitat for a variety of other species (Antolin et al. 2002 , Kotliar et al. 2006 . Consequently, plague-induced die-offs can have effects that reverberate throughout the prairie ecosystem. For example, the black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes), one of the most endangered mammals in the world, depends on large complexes of prairie dog colonies as its primary source of prey and is itself highly susceptible to plague (Antolin et al. 2002 , Matchett et al. 2010 ). Here, we describe recent research into the plague-prairie dog system, which employed approaches such as community ecology, population biology, and epidemiology. We use this investigation as a model for illustrating how disease ecology may prove helpful in developing strategies for understanding and predicting the emergence of other pathogens, such as MERS-CoV or Ebola virus.",

            "text": "The plague bacterium possesses multiple modes of transmission. Classically, flea-borne transmission was thought to be most efficient after Y. pestis forms a biofilm that blocks the flea's proventriculus and midgut, typically 2-3 weeks postinfection. The blockage causes fleas to starve and escalate feeding attempts, which increases Y. pestis transmission (Bacot and Martin 1914 , Eisen et al. 2006 , Wilder et al. 2008 ). Black-tailed prairie dogs are most commonly infested by the prairie dog flea Oropsylla hirsuta (figure 1), and although blockage of the proventriculus had been demonstrated in O. hirsuta, it is an infrequent and inefficient mode of infection in this species (Wilder et al. 2008 ). An epidemiologic SEI (susceptible-exposed-infected) model suggested that Y. pestis transmission by blocked fleas is incapable of driving plague outbreaks in prairie dog colonies because of the temporal delay until blockage occurs (Webb et al. 2006) . Laboratory investigations have since demonstrated that fleas are also capable of early-phase transmission-that is, transmitting plague during the first few days following ingestion of an infectious blood meal and prior to the development of a proventricular blockage (Eisen et al. 2006 , Wilder et al. 2008 ). Both O. hirsuta and the other main prairie dog flea, Oropsylla tuberculata cynomuris, can transmit plague for the 24-48 hours postinfection-and at much higher rates than had been previously measured (Wilder et al. 2008) . Models incorporating early-phase transmission have been able to simulate plague dynamics observed during prairie dog dieoffs (Eisen et al. 2006 , Salkeld et al. 2010 , Buhnerkempe et al. 2011 .",

Prairie dogs are highly social, exhibiting close contact within burrows and while grooming ectoparasites from each other. Like other grounddwelling squirrels, prairie dogs are known to engage in cannibalism (Hoogland 1995) . Therefore, transmission via direct contact may be expected in prairie dogs, and the conditions of subterranean nesting chambers may also be conducive to pneumonic transmission. Laboratory experiments have shown that rodents can be infected with plague by consuming infected prey tissue (Thomas et al. 1989) , and pneumonic transmission has been demonstrated between carnivores and between carnivores and humans (Salkeld and Stapp 2006, Wong et al. 2009 ). Webb and colleagues' (2006) SEI model, however, suggested that pneumonic transmission is unlikely to be important in driving plague outbreaks, and flea-dusting with insecticides slows or stops die-offs in the field (Seery et al. 2003) , implying that vector-borne transmission is likely the predominant mechanism during outbreaks. Although the relative importance of pneumonic, contact, or trophic transmission mechanisms in plague persistence and outbreaks in wild prairie dog colonies remains largely unknown, human exposures are known to have occurred by these routes and by flea-borne transmission .",

In northern Colorado, the probability of colony extinction was influenced by the size and fate of adjacent colonies (Stapp et al. 2004 , Savage et al. 2011 , although the timing of die-offs did not reveal neat colony-to-colony waves of plague spread at a timescale consistent with rapid die-offs. Consequently, one interpretation has been that the bacterium was unlikely to persist within prairie dog populations, and instead, it was thought that plague was normally absent from prairie dog colonies between outbreaks and persisted either in diseaseresistant alternate hosts that shared the same habitat (e.g., deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus) or in nearby locations, such as the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, with occasional incursions into prairie dog populations (Cully and Williams 2001 , Brinkerhoff et al. 2009 .",

During plague outbreaks, both the prevalence and abundance of fleas (O. hirsuta, O. cynomuris tuberculata, and Pulex simulans-the last a flea found on both carnivores and prairie dogs) on prairie dogs increase (figure 2) as hungry, infected fleas search for living prairie dogs after the death of their hosts (Pauli et al. 2006 ). At the same time, fleas in prairie dog burrows become more abundant, and the prevalence of Y. pestis in the fleas increases (St. Romain et al. 2013) . The close-knit nature of the prairie dog coterie suggests that invasion by Y. pestis-in an infectious flea or an infected prairie dog-will almost certainly result in exposure to all of the coterie members. When a coterie perishes or is abandoned, the territory is usually absorbed by an adjacent coterie (Hoogland 1995) , which would imply that infected and hungry fleas can infest exploring Y. pestis-naive prairie dogs, which are then carried back to the home coterie, resulting in coterie-to-coterie pathogen transmission. In this scenario, as plague begins to spread, transmission rates snowball because of increased abundance of fleas searching for meals and the consequent increased opportunities for Y. pestis transmission ).",

That is, if one or two individuals within a coterie die from plague, remaining individuals may be motivated to disperse, carrying Y. pestis with them. Although a modeling scenario that incorporated dispersal and breeding seasons did not reveal noticeable changes in plague transmission rates (Salkeld et al. 2010) , the relationship between coterie boundary dynamics and prairie dog density requires more investigation, especially under the circumstances of a plague outbreak.",

Annual monitoring programs that track size and fate of colonies rely on noticeable declines in prairie dog numbers and lack the fine temporal resolution required to accurately describe spatiotemporal patterns of mortality leading up to and during outbreaks. PCR analysis of prairie dog fleas in northern Colorado demonstrates that plague activity can occur for 6-15 months before obvious prairie dog mortality that may signal an outbreak (figure 2; St. Romain et al. 2013) .

In the case of flea-dusting, reduced prairie dog mortality may have occurred because of the suppression of other unrecognized vector-borne pathogens. Increased survival of black-footed ferrets after vaccination may be caused by protection when animals are exposed to soil or carcasses that harbor viable Y. pestis.

The frequency of colony die-offs varies across years, and an epidemiologic challenge is to discover the degree to which different disease clusters are linked. Determining the distance that Y. pestis travels between and during outbreaks will provide insight into complex underlying mechanisms that dictate longterm persistence of Y. pestis in the environment. Molecular genetic analyses of Y. pestis in Colorado (Lowell et al. 2015) revealed locally confined genotypes, suggesting that the clones of bacteria are maintained at local scales representative of rodent dispersal patterns. This supports the idea that distinct Y. pestis genotypes persist in localized plague foci at spatial scales reflecting prairie dog spatial dynamics and that the transmission and persistence of Y. pestis are facilitated by prairie dog colonies recovering before subsequent reinvasion by Y. pestis. Furthermore, genetic evidence does not support the hypothesis that plague outbreaks on the grasslands occur because Y. pestis is transmitted from a distant maintenance reservoir, such as in the Rocky Mountain foothills, about 100 kilometers (km) from the Pawnee National Grassland (PNG). Interpreted in this way, widespread regional plague activity is the result of Y. pestis clones propagating locally and simultaneously rather than the result of sweeping clonal spread across the landscape. More systematic sampling (spatially and geographically) and improved genotyping of Y. pestis clones are required to determine the spatial extent of Y. pestis foci even though favorable climatic conditions spur plague outbreaks at several locales in chorus (Ben Ari et al. 2011 , Savage et al. 2011 , Lowell et al. 2015 .",

            "text": "The exact mechanism(s) of Y. pestis movement between colonies are still debated. Given the distances between colonies, some authors have presumed that Y. pestis is transported by dispersing prairie dogs that are infected or carrying infected fleas (figure 3; Girard et al. 2004 , Stapp et al. 2004 . Field observations of dispersing black-tailed prairie dogs demonstrate that prairie dogs can move easily between nearby colonies, often negotiating distances of 2-7 km (Garrett and Franklin 1988 ) and occasionally moving up to 10 km (Knowles 1985) . These distances readily encompass the estimated mean dispersal distance for plague (6.9 km) generated for a complex of prairie dog colonies in Montana (Snall et al. 2008) . Genetic studies suggest that that dispersal and gene flow continues on prairie dog colonies after initial colonization, probably along drainage routes, although there is some isolation by distance (Garrett and Franklin 1988 , Roach et al. 2001 , Jones and Britten 2010 . Studies of prairie dog fleas have failed to show an effect of distance on flea gene flow, suggesting that flea dispersal can be widespread Britten 2010, Brinkerhoff et al. 2011) . Given that prairie dog dispersal is commonplace, the movement of infected prairie dogs-or the movement of infectious fleas on prairie dogs-can account for a large portion of plague spread and persistence at the landscape level (Stapp et al. 2004 ) and corroborates recent analyses that show outbreaks can be predicted by connectivity to other towns experiencing plague (as well as current-year climatic conditions). Thus, plague outbreaks cluster in groups of prairie dog colonies with short intercolony distances, whereas isolated colonies experience fewer plague outbreaks (figure 3; Savage et al. 2011) .",

For example, on the PNG, deer mice and ground squirrels are sometimes found seropositive after a prairie dog die-off but do not seem to be involved in Y. pestis transmission dynamics before or during the die-off (Stapp et al. 2008 ). The inherent difficulty in studying rare pathogens prior to noticeable outbreaks is understated, but greater recognition that outbreaks are the zenith of longer-term, possibly cryptic transmission dynamics may allow improved insights into a pathogen's persistence and dynamics by motivating the monitoring and surveillance of wildlife populations prior to outbreaks.",

A plague outbreak in population A may cause a die-off in the hosts, but the pathogen is transmitted to nearby populations (light gray arrows). In the new populations, Y. pestis may (a) smolder and transmit slowly (e.g., population B), (b) cause a new outbreak (e.g., population C), or (c) fade out (e.g., population E). Subsequent spread (dark gray arrows) may occur from populations actively experiencing die-offs (e.g., population C to population D) or from populations experiencing smoldering plague transmission (e.g., population B to population C). Across a mosaic of prairie dog colonies on the landscape, plague may therefore be absent, smoldering, fading out, or causing die-offs.

On the PNG, the northern grasshopper mouse (Onychomys leucogaster) has been implicated as an important component in the ecology of plague outbreaks. Grasshopper mice are common residents of prairie dog colonies, have large active ranges that may encompass multiple coterie territories, and regularly visit multiple prairie dog burrows each night, which, in effect, functionally connects prairie dog coteries despite prairie dog territorial behavior (Kraft and Stapp 2013) . Plague outbreaks tend to occur on prairie dog colonies with high numbers of grasshopper mice or during periods when these mice are abundant (figure 2; Stapp et al. 2009 ). Grasshopper mouse populations decline by approximately two-thirds during prairie dog die-offs, but they exhibit some degree of plague resistance because they frequently seroconvert (Stapp et al. 2008) . During plague outbreaks grasshopper mice become infested and bitten by O. hirsute-a flea normally host specific to prairie dogs , Franklin et al. 2010 ). Both O. hirsuta and Pleochaetis exilis-the latter a flea specific to grasshopper mice-have been found infected with Y. pestis while infesting grasshopper mice, suggesting that grasshopper mice can be infectious hosts . A spatially explicit agent-based model that incorporated grasshopper mouse movements, their ability to harbor prairie dog fleas, prairie dog social structure, and early-phase transmission suggested that higher grasshopper mouse density may increase the rate of spread of plague between coteries that would otherwise be socially isolated (Salkeld et al. 2010) .",

Like the prairie dog-plague system, previous arguments about Ebola virus dynamics have suggested that the high lethality of Ebola virus in nonhuman primate populations indicates the need for a nonprimate reservoir host (Olival and Hayman 2014) . Also like prairie dog plague, most surveys of possible Ebola virus-reservoir species have occurred in the wake of observed outbreaks, which can lead to false interpretations of seropositive species post-outbreak as being integral in Ebola virus ecology prior to the outbreak. If, as in prairie dog systems, host carcasses can be hard to find, there may also be a bias in determining which species are affected by the Ebola virus. The putative Ebola virus reservoir is a fruit bat species, on the basis of experimental inoculations of the virus into bats, similar geographic distributions between Ebola virus outbreaks and bats, and the identification of nucleotide and antibody presence in wild-caught bats (Olival and Hayman 2014) . Some fruit bat species may have reservoir potential, but it is important to remember that this may be only one facet in Ebola virus ecology and that surveys identifying seropositive fruit bats after human outbreaks may have biased subsequent investigations toward bat-Ebola virus ecology, with the consequence that the potential role of nonhuman primates or other ungulates in Ebola virus circulation may have been neglected.",

Or are seropositive fruit bats simply indicative of recent Ebola virus transmission in an unidentified reservoir host some months prior? Without directly addressing these questions, precious public health resources may be misdirected into inappropriate monitoring and surveillance programs. We recognize that an ecological understanding of rare pathogens that cause sporadic outbreaks in wildlife and human populations is no trivial undertaking. We nonetheless encourage the development of integrated surveillance programs for zoonotic diseases within wildlife populations that recognize ecological context before, during, and after outbreaks that occur in humans or animal species of conservation concern.",

The numbers of prairie dogs infected with Yersinia pestis are shown in dark gray. A plague outbreak in population A may cause a die-off in the hosts, but the pathogen is transmitted to nearby populations (light gray arrows). In the new populations, Y. pestis may (a) smolder and transmit slowly (e.g., population B), (b) cause a new outbreak (e.g., population C), or (c) fade out (e.g., population E). Subsequent spread (dark gray arrows) may occur from populations actively experiencing die-offs (e.g., population C to population D) or from populations experiencing smoldering plague transmission (e.g., population B to population C). Across a mosaic of prairie dog colonies on the landscape, plague may therefore be absent, smoldering, fading out, or causing die-offs. Researchers monitoring prairie dog colonies may not notice declines in population density (background gray) in the cases in which fade-out or smoldering transmission occurs; therefore, there is an observer bias in understanding Y. pestis' presence and spread.",
