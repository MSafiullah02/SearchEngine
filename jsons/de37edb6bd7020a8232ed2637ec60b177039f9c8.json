Second, even though the point estimates of our subgroup analyses were largely consistent with our main findings, we had a limited number of influenza infections detected during the study period, and these were largely restricted to a single respiratory season. A larger number of infections from multiple seasons would have been useful to increase the precision of some estimates.

Previous studies using animal models suggested that expression of neuraminidase, an enzyme that cleaves sialic acid on the cell surface and that is produced by influenza, PIV, and pneumococcus, but not the other respiratory viruses tested, could be a common factor that facilitates bacterial adherence, NP pneumococcal colonization, and thus pneumococcal diseases [2] [3] [4] 13] .

Facilitating acquisition of new serotypes through elimination of existing colonizing pneumococcus would not explain our findings, as elimination was similar across exposure groups. Previous experimental studies in animal models have largely focused on new pneumococcal colonization, but there is limited information on the risk of acquisition by replacing colonizing serotype(s) [2, 21, 22] . Although pneumococcal conjugate vaccines prevent acquisition of vaccine serotypes [37] , vaccine use started during the study years in our population and was overall relatively low. This allowed us to explore the natural synergism between respiratory viruses and the pneumococcus in subgroup analysis of unvaccinated children. Finally, the risk of pneumococcal acquisition is modulated by immune and other environmental factors, including the intensity of exposure to the new pneumococcal serotype [2] [3] [4] . However, these factors were not measured in our study, and additional research, including other populations, is warranted to clarify this intriguing observation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 811, "end": 814, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 815, "end": 818, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 819, "end": 822, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 907, "end": 911, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1323, "end": 1326, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1327, "end": 1330, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1331, "end": 1334, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In summary, this study assessed the role of influenza and other common respiratory viruses, including PIV, respiratory syncytial virus, MPV, HRV, and adenovirus on pneumococcal acquisition. Exposure to an influenza or PIV ARI facilitated acquisition of new pneumococcal serotypes in young children, whereas exposure to other study respiratory viruses did not. This association seemed to be especially strong among children who were already colonized with pneumococcus. Our study findings suggest a selective synergism between certain respiratory viruses and pneumococcus. Further research into the specific mechanisms of pneumococcal interaction with influenza and PIV is warranted.
