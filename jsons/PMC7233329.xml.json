            "text": "Some data suggest persons with cancer are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2-infection and to develop coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) compared with normals (1% [95% Confidence Interval (CI), 0.6, 1.7%] versus 0.1% [0, 0.12%]), but these estimates are controversial and it is unclear if this increased risk applies to persons with all cancer types [1\u20138]. One study of 125 hospitalised persons with haematological cancers had a 10 percent (6, 17%) case rate of COVID-19 but none of their subjects had chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) [9]. We performed a cross-sectional survey of non-hospitalized persons with CML receiving tyrosine kinase-inhibitor (TKI)-therapy in Hubei Province to explore the prevalence and clinical features of COVID-19 during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Prevalence of COVID-19 in persons with CML, 0.9 percent (0.1, 1.8%) was substantially higher than normals but lower than hospitalised persons with haematological cancers. Clinical features of COVID-19 in our subjects and otherwise normal persons were similar. We identified co-variates associated with an increased risk of developing COVID-19. Persons with these co-variates may benefit from increased SARS-CoV-2-infection surveillance and possible protective isolation.",

An online questionnaire was distributed and collected by physicians at each centre. Persons with CML or their family (if they were too sick or died) were asked to complete the questionnaire which included two dimensions (Supplementary 1). The 1st included 16 questions assessing demographics, co-morbidities, CML-related data including diagnosis, therapy and response. The 2nd included 12 questions related to COVID-19 including exposure history, symptoms of acute respiratory illness such as fever, cough, shortness of breath and fatigue, diagnosis, treatment and outcome. Missing or unclear data items were collected and clarified by direct communication between physicians and the patient, their family and/or health-care providers.
