            "text": "The URIs are in 69% of viral origin (M\u00e4kel\u00e4 et al. 1998). Orthomyxoviruses (influenza A and B), paramyxoviruses (parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial viruses), coronaviruses, adenoviruses, and enteroviruses (coxsackie and ECHO viruses) cause common cold. However, most colds are caused by more than 89 types of rhinoviruses (Musher 2003; Cooper et al. 2001). More than 40 strains of adenoviruses cause pharyngitis resembling a strep throat. Rhinoviruses are unresponsive to antibiotics and other medications that control bacterial infections. Antibiotic treatment of adenovirus infections is of no value and sometimes can even be harmful, because it supresses normal bacterial flora and enables the resistant opportunistic pathogens to grow in an uncontrolled way (Nester et al. 1995). Different bacteria, including Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Sreptococcus pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus are involved with the upper respiratory system (Murray et al. 2005). The most common URI of bacterial origin is pharyngitis caused by Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, with Streptococcous pyogenes as a main representative, which accounts for 5\u201310% of pharyngitides (Poole and Portugal 2005). Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are the most important bacterial pathogens in otitis media and bacterial conjunctivitis. Less commonly, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcous pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus are the causative agents in otitis media. A study carried out in the Czech Republic in 2004/05 in 16 different cities among healthy children aged 3\u20136 years show that the overall carriage of pathogens was 62.8%, with Streptococcus pneumoniae 38.1%, Haemophilus influenzae 24.9%, Moraxella catarrhalis 22.1%, and Staphylococcus aureus 16% being the most prevalent (Zemlickova et al. 2006).",

Targeted therapy is not available for most viruses that cause URI. Therefore, viral testing is rarely indicated for uncomplicated URIs in the outpatient setting. However, confirmation of a viral condition such as influenza may reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics (Balentine and Siamak 2015). Considering the benfits for patient, the speed to identify the etiologic agent clearly favors the FilmArray System. This method readily identified the etiologic agent in both patients in whom it was applied in the present study, whereas the HIT identified the virus only in the repeat sample of the second patient. However, identification of the etiologic agent did not have any benefit for the first patient with mild symptomatology of coryza because no targeted treatment for human rhinovirus/enterovirus infection was needed. The symptomatology in the second patient was severe and the speed of pathogen identification is crucial for the commencement of appropriate treatment, especially in suspected cases of influenza where early administration of neuraminidase inhibitors significantly reduces mortality rates. In such cases, accuratelly targeted therapy has an enormous benefit for the patient. The laboratory costs to run one examination with different methods showed that the FilmArray multiplex PCR respiratory panel is more expensive than the ELISA, HIT, and the cultivation. One examination with the FilmArray panel brought a 181.50 \u20ac per patient profit for the laboratory, whereas the profit from running ELISA together with cultivation was 34.62 \u20ac, and that from HIT was 38.80 \u20ac per patient.

However, advantages of those methods are that they are readily available in many laboratories and are least pricey for health insurance. The disadvantage is that the spectrum of pathogens detected is small. A clinical benefit of the FilmArray respiratory panel is that it is quick and exact and may identify a broader spectrum of possible pathogens. Since most URIs are viral in origin and there is no treatment available, the diagnosis provided by the FilmArray panel is not always necessary and the method should be used on an individual basis when clinically justified. From the economic standpoint, FilmArray respiratory panel is the most profitable for the laboratory. In critically ill patients, a spectrum of diagnostic methods should be used to obtain diagnosis as fast as possible. In patients with minor respiratory tract infections, a more rational approach should be undertaken since the speed and accuracy of diagnosis are less crucial. The decision to choose a specific diagnostic method rests with the medical caregiving staff.",
