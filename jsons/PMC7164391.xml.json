COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (2). Two other coronaviruses have caused world-wide outbreaks in the past two decades, namely SARS-CoV (2002\u20132003) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (2012\u2013present). The surface spike glycoprotein (S), which is critical for virus entry through engaging the host receptor and mediating virus-host membrane fusion, is the major antigen of coronaviruses. The S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which are phylogenetically closely related, have an amino-acid sequence identity of around 77% (3). Such a high degree of sequence similarity raises the possibility that cross-reactive epitopes may exist.",

            "text": "CR3022, which was previously isolated from a convalescent SARS patient, is a neutralizing antibody that targets the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV (4). The immunoglobulin heavy chain variable, diversity, and joining (IGHV, IGHD, and IGHJ) regions are encoded by germline genes IGHV5-51, IGHD3-10, and IGHJ6, while the light chain variable and joining regions are encoded by IGKV4-1 and IGKJ2 (4). Based on IgBlast analysis (5), the IGHV of CR3022 is 3.1% somatically mutated at the nucleotide sequence level, which results in eight amino-acid changes from the germline sequence, whereas IGKV of CR3022 is 1.3% somatically mutated resulting in three amino-acid changes from the germline sequence (fig. S1). A recent study has shown that CR3022 can also bind to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 (6). This finding provides an opportunity to uncover a cross-reactive epitope. We therefore determined the crystal structure of CR3022 with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Fig. 1A) at 3.1 \u00c5 resolution (table S1 and fig. S2, A and B) (7). CR3022 uses both heavy and light chains (Fig. 1B), and all six complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops (Fig. 1C) for interaction with the RBD. The buried surface area on the epitope is 917 \u00c52 and SARS-CoV-2 recognition by CR3022 is largely driven by hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 1E). Five out of 11 somatic mutations are found in the paratope region (defined as residues on the antibody buried by RBD) (fig. S2C), implying their likely importance in the affinity maturation process.",

            "text": "Out of 28 residues in the epitope (defined as residues buried by CR3022), 24 (86%) are conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (Figs. 1D and 2A). This high sequence conservation explains the cross-reactivity of CR3022. Nonetheless, despite having a high conservation of the epitope residues, CR3022 Fab binds to SARS-CoV RBD (Kd = 1 nM) with a much higher affinity than to SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Kd = 115 nM) (Table 1 and fig. S3). The difference in binding affinity of CR3022 between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBDs is likely due to the non-conserved residues in the epitope (Fig. 2). The most dramatic difference is an additional N-glycosylation site at N370 on SARS-CoV (N357 in SARS-CoV numbering). The N-glycan sequon (NxS/T) arises from an amino-acid difference at residue 372, where SARS-CoV has a Thr compared to Ala in SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2B). Mass spectrometry analysis shows that a complex glycan is indeed present at this N-glycosylation site in SARS-CoV (8). An N-glycan at N370 would fit into a groove formed between heavy and light chains (Fig. 2C), which could increase contact and, hence, binding affinity to CR3022. This result also suggests that the difference in antigenicity between the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV can at least be partially attributed to the N-glycosylation site at residue 370. We tested whether CR3022 was able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in an in vitro microneutralization assay (7). While CR3022 could neutralize SARS-CoV, it did not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 at the highest concentration tested (400 \u03bcg/mL) (fig. S4). This in vitro neutralization result is consistent with lower affinity binding of CR3022 for SARS-CoV-2, although other explanations are possible as outlined below.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 uses the same host receptor, angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as SARS-CoV (3, 9\u201311). Interestingly, the epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2-binding site (Fig. 3A). Structural alignment of the CR3022-SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex with the ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex (11) further indicates that binding of CR3022 would not clash with ACE2 (12). This analysis implies that the neutralization mechanism of CR3022 for SARS-CoV does not depend on direct blocking of receptor binding, which is consistent with the observation that CR3022 does not compete with ACE2 for binding to the RBD (6). Unlike CR3022, most known SARS RBD-targeted antibodies compete with ACE2 for binding to RBD (4, 13\u201316). The epitopes of these antibodies are very different from that of CR3022 (Fig. 3B). In fact, it has been shown that CR3022 can synergize with other RBD-targeted antibodies to neutralize SARS-CoV (4). Although CR3022 itself cannot neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in this in vitro assay, whether CR3022 can synergize with other SARS-CoV-2 RBD-targeted monoclonal antibodies for neutralization remains to be determined.",

            "text": "The recently determined cryo-EM structure of homotrimeric SARS-CoV-2 S protein (17, 18) demonstrated that the RBD, as in other coronaviruses (19, 20) can undergo a hinge-like movement to transition between \u201cup\u201d or \u201cdown\u201d conformations (Fig. 4A). ACE2 host receptor can only interact with the RBD when it is in the \u201cup\u201d conformation, whereas the \u201cdown\u201d conformation is inaccessible to ACE2. Interestingly, the epitope of CR3022 is also only accessible when the RBD is in the \u201cup\u201d conformation (Fig. 4, B and C). However, even when one RBD in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is in the \u201cup\u201d conformation, the binding of CR3022 to RBD can still be sterically hindered. Structural alignment of CR3022-SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (17, 18) indicates that CR3022 variable region would clash with the RBD on the adjacent protomer if the latter adopted a \u201cdown\u201d conformation. In addition, CR3022 variable domain would clash with the S2 underneath the RBD, and CR3022 constant region would clash with the N-terminal domain (Fig. 4D). Although as compared to SARS-CoV-2, the \u201cup\u201d conformation of the RBD in SARS-CoV has a larger dihedral angle to the horizontal plane of the S protein (fig. S5), the same clashes described above would exist in SARS-CoV S protein (fig. S6).",

The clash with the CR3022 variable domain can be partially relieved when the targeted RBD on one protomer of the trimer and the RBD on the adjacent protomer are both in the \u201cup\u201d conformation (Fig. 4E). Of note, SARS-CoV S protein with two RBDs in the \u201cup\u201d conformation has been observed in cryo-EM studies (19, 21, 22). Nevertheless, clashes to N-terminal domain (NTD) and S2 would still exist in the two-\u201cup\u201d configuration. Further structural modeling shows that all clashes can be avoided with a slight rotation of the targeted-RBD in the double-\u201cup\u201d configuration (Fig. 4F). This conformational change is likely to be physiological relevant since CR3022 can neutralize SARS-CoV. In addition, our ELISA experiment demonstrated that CR3022 is able to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. While the binding signals of CR3022 and m396, which is a SARS-CoV-specific antibody (Fig. 4G, left panel) (6, 17) to SARS-CoV virus were comparable in ELISA (p-value > 0.05, two-tailed t test), CR3022 had a significantly higher binding signal compared to m396 to the SARS-CoV-2 virus (p-value = 0.003, two-tailed t test) (Fig. 4G, right panel), although less than to SARS CoV, consistent with their relative binding to the RBD (Table 1 and fig. S3).",

Recently, our group and others have identified a conserved epitope on influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) that is located in the trimeric interface and is only exposed through protein \u201cbreathing\u201d (23\u201325), which is somewhat analogous to the epitope of CR3022. Antibodies to this influenza HA trimeric interface epitope do not exhibit in vitro neutralization activity but can confer in vivo protection. Similarly, antibodies to another conserved epitope that partially overlaps with the influenza HA trimeric interface also are non-neutralizing in vitro, but protective in vivo (26). Examples of antibodies that do not have in vitro neutralization activity but confer in vivo protection, have also been reported for influenza virus (27), herpesvirus (28), cytomegalovirus (29), alphavirus (30), and dengue virus (31). Therefore, although CR3022 does not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, it is possible that this epitope can confer in vivo protection. Further studies will require suitable animal models, which have yet to be established.",

(F) All clashes can be resolved if the targeted RBD is slightly rotated in the double-\u201cup\u201d configuration. The curved arrow indicates the change in CR3022 orientation due to the slight rotation of the \u00adRBD. Of note, given the elbow angle between the constant and variable domains of CR3022 is the same as observed in our crystal structure, our model shows a maximum rotation angle of around 45\u00b0 for the RBD would avoid all clashes. However, the elbow region of an antibody is known to be highly flexible. Therefore, the rotation angle of the RBD could be much smaller when the spike trimer is bound to CR3022.
