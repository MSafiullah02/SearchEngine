These residents are by no means the only victims within the health care system; this virus has claimed the lives of attendings, nurses, and other essential healthcare providers.",

We were taught that the most important thing is to make sure you are safe, your partner is safe, and then worry about the patient. We do not let firefighters run into buildings without the proper equipment; it follows that we should not let doctors and nurses tend to the ill unprotected. When we took the Hippocratic Oath, we agreed to run into a burning building for the sick, but we did not agree to do it naked. Without protecting our healthcare workers, our healthcare system will fail.",

The Department of Homeland Security was trying to redirect the PPE that the hospital was trying to purchase.

Governors and other state officials have called on us to donate our PPE to hospitals, but still expect us to see emergency patients in the private setting to reduce the strain on the emergency system.
