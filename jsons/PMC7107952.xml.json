Published studies of the association between MBL deficiency and bacterial infection or sepsis were identified by search of the PubMed database, and investigators were invited to share individual patient data. These studies [6, 10\u201312, 16, 20] included 675 patients for whom MBL levels and/or MBL2 genotypes had been determined. Specifically, MBL levels were measured in 558 patients (table 1). Blood samples for MBL assays were obtained on the day of diagnosis of sepsis [6, 10, 20] or within 48 h [11, 12, 16] after the diagnosis. MBL levels were determined by double-sandwich ELISA in all studies other than the Dutch peritonitis series [20] in which mannan-binding ELISA was used. The patients in this study of combined data were classified as being MBL deficient or replete with use of the MBL serum level cutoff derived from the preceding analysis of healthy control subjects. Data on the specific organism causing sepsis were present for 482 patients; 287 of these patients had bacteremia. Data on the presence or absence of comorbidities were recorded for a total of 326 patients. These included information on the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hepatopathy, cancer, diabetes, and HIV infection in 264 patients. An additional 62 patients had comorbidities classified on the basis of the McCabe score [24]. The quality of the genetic associations reported by these studies was assessed on the basis of published criteria [25].

The MBL levels in patients with the YA/O genotype were clearly intermediate between these obviously low-producing MBL2 genotypes and the high-producing MBL groups of YA/YA, YA/XA, and XA/XA. The XA/O and O/O groups were chosen to definitively represent the MBL2-deficient genotypes. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that MBL level was a reliable predictor of these MBL2 genotypes (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.90) (figure 2). An MBL serum level of 0.50 \u226ag/mL maximized sensitivity and specificity for predicting low-producing MBL2 genotypes (both were 82%). This cutoff had a positive predictive value of 31% and a negative predictive value of 98%. This level is proposed as a useful indicator of MBL deficiency, particularly for screening purposes, because of its high negative predictive value.",

These median quality scores are higher than those found in a systematic review of studies of genetic association and sepsis [25]. The most common deficiencies of the studies used in the review were the absence of power calculations and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium analysis. A power calculation for the present study was performed assuming a 25% mortality rate and a frequency of MBL deficiency of 30%. This mortality rate was chosen because it is midway between the reported mortalities for pneumococcal bacteremia [26] and severe sepsis [27], and the majority of this cohort consists of patient groups with these conditions. Assuming a relative risk of death of 2 among MBL-deficient patients, 168 patients would be required to achieve 80% power to detect a difference between groups at a P value of .05. We were able to evaluate survival among 477 patients who had their MBL levels determined; this is substantially more than the number required to power this observation. Overall, there were 123 deaths among 591 patients (mortality, 21%) for whom information on in-hospital survival relating to the episode of severe infection was available.",

Therefore, the presence of bacteremia and patient comorbidities were used instead to assess independent risk factors for death.

The size of the cohort (n=1642) made it possible to generalize with far greater certainty than with previous studies about the MBL levels to be expected in those with the lowest-producing MBL2 genotypes. Assessment of the MBL levels found in each of the MBL2 genotype groups revealed that the interquartile ranges in patients with XA/O and O/O genotypes are substantially lower than 0.50 \u226ag/mL and that this level coincides with the median in patients with the YA/O genotype. Furthermore, the lower quartile (0.28 \u226ag/mL) in patients with the YA/O approximates the upper quartile (0.39 \u226ag/mL) in patients with the XA/O genotype. The patients with the other MBL2 genotypes (YA/YA, YA/XA, and XA/XA) had median MBL levels that were clearly higher than this cutoff. On the basis of these findings, we propose that patients with the XA/O or O/O genotype can be considered to be clearly MBL deficient. It would be inappropriate to use the O/O group alone to determine MBL deficiency because of the very substantial overlap with patients with the XA/O genotype. Subsequently, receiver operating characteristic analysis confirmed that an MBL level \u2a7e0.50 \u226ag/mL is a valid indicator of the presence of MBL2-deficient genotypes.",

Although our study revealed that a serum MBL level \u2a7e0.5 \u226ag/mL is a valid indicator of the presence of the low-producing MBL2 genotypes XA/O and O/O, such low levels have also been found in a significant number of persons with alternative genotypes.

MBL binds to pneumococcus [30], but this may be abrogated in the presence of a polysaccharide capsule [31]. It must be recognized that the MBL pathway is a minor contributor to complement-mediated defence against S. pneumoniae, compared with the classic pathway [32]. MBL does, however, also contribute to bacterial killing by noncomplement mechanisms, such as opsonophagocytosis. Pathogens other than S. pneumoniae were isolated in samples from fewer patients in our study than was S. pneumoniae. Specifically, the smaller numbers of patients with S. aureus infection may explain the absence of an apparent significant association between MBL deficiency and death in these patients because of insufficient statistical power (multivariable analysis data not shown). MBL appears to play a role in the response to S. aureus infection, binding to the organism and precipitating C4 deposition with increased neutrophil phagocytosis [33]. Compelling evidence from a MBL knockout mouse model revealed reduced survival in S. aureus\u2013infected MBL-null animals [34]. MBL deficiency appears to predispose to meningococcal sepsis [35], another severe infection caused by an encapsulated organism. This clinical association is also supported by investigations of the ability of MBL to bind to and facilitate killing of Neisseria meningitidis [36]. There was only a small number of patients with N. meningitidis infection in the current study, because patients from a previous large study did not have MBL levels or MBL2 promoter haplotypes determined [35].",

In the context of surgical injury, MBL levels were not shown to alter substantially, in marked comparison to the known acute-phase reactants CRP and IL-6 [38]. It is unlikely, therefore, that a substantial decrease in MBL levels as a result of consumption from sepsis is the cause of the association between low MBL level, sepsis, and poor outcome. This is particularly pertinent to the association demonstrated between MBL deficiency and death in patients with pneumococcal sepsis. Although changes in MBL have been correlated with the type of organism causing sepsis, it has been shown that MBL is consumed in sepsis due to gram-negative, but not gram-positive, organisms [39].",

            "text": "MBL may be extracted from plasma or produced by recombinant means for clinical use in deficient or septic patients. Phase I studies of MBL infusion have been performed [40]. MBL has a long serum half-life, and there is limited experience of its use for cystic fibrosis [41] and other chronic infections. Recombinant human MBL replacement therapy is now being studied in clinical trials involving patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplantation and liver transplantation. The data from the large patient cohort that we report suggest a serum level that reliably indicates MBL deficiency. It is clear from this data that low MBL level is a more reliable indicator of deficiency than is the presence of low-producing MBL2 genotypes. This rationally derived MBL serum level cutoff for deficiency could be used to guide replacement therapy with MBL. Because death in the context of severe bacterial infection, especially when due to pneumococcus, was associated with MBL deficiency after adjustment for bacteremia, age, and comorbidity, severe bacterial pneumonia could be an important future target for study of MBL therapy. Mortality associated with bacteremic pneumococcal infection has remained largely unchanged, despite 50 years of advancements in supportive care. Treatment with an innate, immune-based therapy may provide a new opportunity to reduce this substantial disease burden.",
