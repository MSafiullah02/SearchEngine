Three-year-old male cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), 4-week-old female BALB/c mice, and 4-week-old F344 rats were used. Monkeys were inoculated intranasally with 10 3 or 10 6 TCID 50 of SARS-CoV in 3.5 ml of medium, or intratracheally with 10 8 TCID 50 in 5 ml of medium. BALB/c mice and F344 rats were inoculated intranasally with 2x10 6 TCID 50 of SARS-CoV in 20 \u00b5l of medium and 10 7 TCID 50 in 100 \u00b5l of medium, respectively. After inoculation, these animals were observed for clinical symptoms and sacrificed for pathological examination. Virus isolation and viral infectivity titers were investigated in National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Musashimurayama, Tokyo 208-0011, Japan. * *",

In one of the two monkeys inoculated intratracheally with 10 8 TCID 50 of SARS-CoV, virus and viral genome were detected in throat swabs collected on day 2 p.i. and in rectal swabs collected from days 4 to 7 p.i., respectively. Virus antigen-positive alveolar cells and macrophages were detected in the lower lobes of the lungs on day 7 p.i. in monkeys after intratracheal inoculation ( Figure 1A ). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2, a receptor for SARS-CoV 2 antigen-positive cells were observed in the virus-infected area and were repairing swelled type II alveolar epithelium in the lung of monkeys ( Figure  1A , B, and C). In BALB/c mice, the virus was detected in nasal and lung washes on days 3 and 5 after intranasal inoculation with 10 6 TCID 50 of SARS-CoV. Virus antigen was found in the epithelial cells in the lung alveolar and nasal cavities on day 3 as well as slight inflammatory reaction. In contrast, virus antigen was observed in the epithelial cells of intrapulmonary bronchi with inflammatory cells, including macrophages, in F344 rats after intranasal inoculation with 10 7 TCID 50 of SARS-CoV ( Figure 1D ). ACE2 antigen was observed in the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract in mock-infected F344 rats ( Figure 1E ). In BALB/c mice, ACE2 antigen-positive cells were not detected in noninfected areas ( Figure 1F ). In these experimental animals, ACE2 antigen-positive cells were observed in the virus-infected area and were repairing swelled type II alveolar epithelium (Table 1 ). In BALB/c mice and F344 rats, the virus was eliminated by day 7 p.i. None of the three experimental animals developed any clinical symptoms similar to SARS-like disease.",

However, there were differences in pathological findings, such as distribution of SARS-CoV and ACE2 antigen in the lungs between monkey, mouse, and rat ( Table 1 ). The localization of infection with SARS-CoV was associated with the distribution of ACE2 antigen. These results indicated that ACE2 was used as a receptor for SARS-CoV infection in these animals. Furthermore, pathological dissimilarities in infectious and inflammatory reactions were observed between BALB/c mice and F334 rats. It was reported previously that monkeys were not suitable for studies of SARS. 3, 4 Although none of the three types of experimental animal examined here developed any SARS-like symptoms, SARS-CoV could infect and replicate in these animals after intranasal or intratracheal inoculation. Therefore, these animal models are thought to be useful not only for studies on SARS-CoV infection and pathogenesis, but also for evaluation of novel vaccine and antiviral drugs against this virus.
