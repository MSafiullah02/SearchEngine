In normal tissues most M\u03a6 and DC are considered to be \u2018tissue-resident\u2019, populating the tissue early in life, often specifically named. In the CNS, the resident M\u03a6 are microglia. They originate from the yolk sac [1] and are renewed in situ\n[2]. During inflammation, however, monocytes can migrate from the bloodstream into affected tissues, including the CNS, where they differentiate into \u201cinfiltrating\u201d M\u03a6 or DC. Whilst these resident and infiltrating cells may play prominent roles in the CNS during viral or autoimmune disease, the methods by which the inflamed CNS induce the mobilisation of monocytes in the bone marrow is poorly understood. Moreover, the signalling events responsible for alternate monocyte or DC differentiation in the local inflammatory environment of the CNS are not well described. As these signalling events dictate the nature and progression of the immune response to CNS pathologies, an understanding of the mechanisms involved is crucial to identify novel targets for immune modulating therapy in these diseases.",

They can be identified in human and mouse by flow cytometry, using a combination of cell surface markers. Under normal conditions, the entire monocyte population is identified as CD14+ (including CD14lo and CD14hi subpopulations) in humans, and CD115+CD11b+ in mice and humans. In both species, two principle populations and an \u2018intermediate\u2019 population are identifiable. Classical (also termed \u2018inflammatory\u2019) monocytes are CD14hi CD16\u2212 in humans and Ly6Chi (CD43lo CCR2hi CX3 CR1lo) in mice and are the major monocyte population in the blood [3], [4]. Non-classical (also termed \u2018patrolling\u2019) monocytes, represent a much smaller subset (approximately 10%) of blood monocytes and are CD14lo CD16hi in humans, and Ly6Clo (CD43hi CCR2lo CX3 CR1hi) in mice [3], [4]. The intermediate group is CD14hiCD16hi in humans and Ly6ChiCD43hi population in mice. There are transcriptional similarities between humans and mice comparing their respective subsets, but functionally, mouse classical monocytes appear to be more related to human intermediate monocytes, based on their pro-inflammatory roles [5]. During normal hematopoiesis in mice, the M\u03a6/DC progenitor (MDP) gives rise to a pre-DC [6] and a recently-described common monocyte progenitor (cMoP), distinguished from the MDP by its downregulated CD135 and upregulated Ly6C, although it still lacks CD11b. The cMoP differentiates into c-kit\u2212 CD115+ CD11b+ Ly6C+ monocytes and in turn into c-kit\u2212 CD115+ CD11b+ Ly6C\u2212 monocytes [7].",

Under homeostatic conditions, Ly6Clo CX3CR1hi monocytes patrol the luminal side of vascular endothelium in a programmatic, albeit peripatetic manner [8]. During inflammation, however, Ly6Chi monocytes emigrate from the BM along the CCR2\u2013CCL2 axis into foci of tissue inflammation, differentiating into inflammatory M\u03a6, TipDC, or inflammatory DC, which may then migrate to the draining lymph node (DLN), presumably transporting antigen acquired on the way [5], [9]. While microglia are normally self-renewing [2], they may be supplemented and/or replenished by infiltrating Ly6Chi monocytes during CNS infection and/or irradiative inflammation [10], [11] and these immigrants become Ly6Clo on entry into inflamed tissue [5], [9]. Ly6Clo monocytes are also recruited in later stages of inflammation where they are involved in tissue repair. These cells typically differentiate into M2, i.e., anti-inflammatory, M\u03a6, supporting healing in the injured spinal cord [12]. However, the developmental connection between these 2 phenotypically similar but often temporally disparate populations is not completely clear.",

Recently, BM stromal cells, but not HSC, were shown to secrete CCL2 in response to low levels of circulating Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands [5]. This induced monocyte migration towards the vascular sinuses, and was dependent on myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88) (involved in responses to TLR ligand binding in all but TLR-3 [15]), but was independent of TNF and type-I interferon (IFN) expression.

This signal is presumably provided by direct inflammatory stimulation of HSC or other progenitors, inducing increased differentiation of self-renewing HSC into downstream progenitors [13]. Direct inflammatory modulation of HSC (which are CCR2+) by circulating TLR has been described, inducing such differentiation [16]. Furthermore, soluble immune-mediators may induce BM changes; Seo et al. showed that IFN-\u03b1 signalling to HSC was required for the generation of Ly6Chi monocytes in a model of viral pneumonia [17] and type I IFN, produced in the spleen in response to infection with Listeria monocytogenes, promoted monocyte emigration from the BM [16]. Interestingly, mice deficient in either MyD88 or IFN-\u03b1 receptor (IFNAR) still had significant monocyte migration from the BM to the site of inflammation, whereas mice deficient in both did not [16]. Interestingly, in these studies, IFN-\u03b3 did not play an important role in monocytopoiesis. However, in a model of chronic Mycobacterium avium infection, IFN-\u03b3, but not IFN-\u03b1, was found to activate HSC, resulting in differentiation into downstream myeloid and lymphoid progenitors replacing the diminished populations [18], [19]. On the other hand, in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), GM-CSF produced by CNS cells triggers monocyte mobilisation and emigration from the BM [20].",

            "text": "In CNS-initiated mobilisation of the BM, it is unclear if there is a difference in initiating events that predisposes to the preferential differentiation of monocytes towards a M\u03a6 or DC phenotype, prior to entering the CNS. The fact that TLR, type-I and -II IFN, and GM-CSF each induce monocyte emigration and the production of monocytes from progenitors in different situations may explain some differences in the manner of BM mobilisation by different CNS pathologies. Monocyte infiltration during viral encephalitis is rapid, with lethality in animal models occurring within days of initial infiltration [10], [21]. The pathogenesis of EAE, on the other hand, is chronic and/or relapsing and depends on T cell responses against myelin proteins that are initially induced by DC [22]. Nevertheless, a potential connection exists between viral and auto-immune causes of CNS infiltration by monocytes. In multiple sclerosis (MS), there is evidence to suggest that reactivity against myelin proteins may occur following CNS viral infection, if anti-viral responses cross-react with myelin proteins [23]. The initial presence of viral RNA or DNA in the circulation could certainly induce monocyte emigration from the BM, via binding of intracellular RNA by TLR within BM stromal cells [24], and TLR stimulation or direct infection of HSC could induce downstream differentiation of these cells [13]. However, although TLR ligands may be present initially, recurrent episodes of MS would have few if any virus-associated TLR ligands. It is also possible that whilst type I IFN (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) and type II IFN (IFN-\u03b3) are involved in both CNS diseases, the innate differential production of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, crucial for virus control in the early response against CNS viruses [25], by a variety of cell types during infection [26] may induce monocyte mobilisation differently from that seen in MS/EAE. High levels of IFN-\u03b3, which play a role in viral disease pathogenesis [27], is associated with the later development of the adaptive immune response, and may contribute here to the continued recruitment of monocytes. In contrast to acute viral infection, in EAE that progresses as a relapsing or chronic condition, IFN-\u03b3 production occurs over a long period of time, similar to the role of IFN-\u03b3 in HSC stimulation in chronic infection of the lung [18], [19]. As such, the differences in type-I and type-II IFN production may differentially skew the monocyte phenotype towards a M\u03a6 profile in acute infection and a DC profile in a chronic non-infectious setting. However, this has not been investigated experimentally.",

CCR2, which is upregulated on monocytes in a variety of CNS pathologies, binds to CCL2 (or CCL7), which is produced at high levels by infected neurons in animal models of WNV encephalitis [10] and likely by glial cells in EAE [29]. CCL2 neutralisation in WNV encephalitis [10] or CCL2 (or CCL7) deletion in bacterial infection [30] result in reduced monocyte recruitment. Whilst this resulted in higher bacterial loads, in the latter case, reduced monocyte infiltration during WNV encephalitis led to extended, but not permanent survival in mice [10]. This highlights the severity of the immunopathology induced by infiltrating monocytes in the CNS. CCL5 is highly upregulated in a variety of viral CNS infections [10], [31] and binds to CCR5 (expressed on Ly6Chi monocytes) and CCR1. In MS, infiltrating monocytes express both CCR1 and CCR5, with their ligands being expressed in the inflamed CNS [32], [33]. CCL2 and CCL5 are both upregulated in CNS infection with WNV [10], [31]. In EAE, mRNA and protein levels of CX3CL1 and CX3CR1 are elevated in the dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord [34]. Whilst these studies were focused on neuropathic pain, they highlight the potential for recruiting CX3CR1+ non-classical monocytes to the inflamed CNS during EAE/MS. Interestingly, in atherosclerosis, CCR2lo monocytes did not rely on CX3CR1 to enter plaques, instead using CCR5 to some extent, while CCR2hi monocytes used CX3CR1, CCR2, and CCR5 [35], emphasising the ability of monocytes to adapt in different disease settings.",

VLA-4 antibody blockade reduced monocyte infiltration by \u223c60% and increased survival by up to 60% in infected mice. Not surprisingly, as VLA-4 antibody blockade is used in MS to reduce T cell infiltration, this treatment also reduced T cell infiltration into the CNS in these animals, however, importantly, this was not sufficient to abrogate virus clearance. On the other hand, despite reducing monocyte infiltration by >30% in these experiments, LFA-1 blockade had no effect on survival [21]. It has been shown that patrolling of the luminal side of vascular endothelium by Ly6Clo monocytes is mediated by LFA-1 [8]. This raises the possibility that interfering with LFA-1-mediated interactions might prevent Ly6Clo, potentially M2 monocytes, from entering the CNS, which may abrogate normal anti-inflammatory processes in viral encephalitis and enhance immunopathology mediated by infiltrating Ly6Chi monocytes. However, this was not explored in these studies. This study highlights the differential function of monocyte subsets using different adhesion molecule-integrin receptor pairs, and the importance of VLA-4 use by Ly6Chi monocytes in CNS invasion. Moreover, this was the first study to demonstrate in vivo that carefully timed suppression of specific elements of the innate immune system during an acute lethal neurotropic infection could enhance survival by reducing immunopathology without interfering with the generation of immunity.",

This infiltrate typically contains monocytes, which differentiate into M\u03a6 or activated microglial phenotypes in the brain, and these have been implicated in several diseases. Thus, inflammatory M\u03a6 infiltration precedes the onset and peak of disease symptoms in neurotropic coronavirus infection [40]. In lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), monocytes (as well as neutrophils) play a highly pathogenic role [41]. Theiler\u2019s encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection results in major inflammatory monocyte infiltration into the CNS within 48 h and ultimately induces severe monocyte-dependent CNS damage, with subsequent differentiation into activated M\u03a6 linked to the development of CNS lesions [42], [43], [44]. Several other neuroinvasive viruses, such as neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and WNV, are associated with M\u03a6 infiltration into the CNS [45], [46], [47], [48]. Inflammatory (Ly6Chi) monocyte differentiation into Ly6Chi M\u03a6 and/or activated microglia upon entry into the CNS is a key feature of WNV encephalitis and plays a significant role in the pathology (and lethality) of this disease [10].",

In EAE, the mouse model widely used to study T cell-mediated autoimmune disease in general and MS specifically, inflammatory monocytes have a major impact. Breaking peripheral tolerance to myelin proteins, leads to activation of myelin-specific T cells in secondary lymphoid organs. Once these T cells arrive in the CNS they become re-activated by APCs, resulting in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IFN-\u03b3, IL-17, GM-CSF and TNF, as well as chemokines by T cells. The circulating Ly6Chi monocyte population, which expands exponentially before EAE onset, represents a major proportion of the inflammatory cells in the EAE CNS and are DC precursors. Although M\u03a6 are observed in the CNS of EAE mice, DC are more efficient APC and activated DC co-localize with CD4+ T cells responsible for demyelination in the CNS, implicating DC, rather than M\u03a6, in the amplification of responses [20], [50], [51].",

Interestingly, however, dramatically reducing immigration of inflammatory monocytes into the CNS at particular timepoints in either of these diseases using negatively charged microparticles, which mediate sequestration and apoptosis of these cells in the spleen, abrogates the symptomatology and in the case of WNV encephalitis, results in up to 60% survival with immunity in an otherwise lethal disease [52]. This suggests that these cells are very similar, if not the same, in the blood stream in both diseases, and that their differentiation is mediated in the CNS, presumably by the prevailing milieu, despite their different fates there. Alternatively, it is possible that separate M\u03a6 and DC precursors may share a common receptor that mediates particle uptake, resulting in both being sequestered by the spleen with the same apoptotic outcomes.",

A separate study utilizing microspheres as monocyte markers, also suggests that the decision of monocytes to differentiate into M\u03a6 or DC might not solely be determined by cytokines. The authors found that adding microspheres to phagocytic monocytes travelling to the lymph node (LN) induced differentiation into DCs, while monocytes staying at the site of activation became M\u03a6 [54]. The differentiation of monocyte-derived DC (MDDC) in the absence of inflammatory stimuli is likely a result of basal levels of signaling factors present in this environment. These studies, while useful, do not account for the confounding possibility that the microspheres themselves, once phagocytosed, may have their own influence on the subsequent differentiation of monocytes [52].",

GM-CSF, also known as CSF-2, is secreted by a broad range of cells upon stimulation with cytokines, microbial products and/or antigens, and regulates survival, differentiation, and activation of target cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, M\u03a6 and DC [55], [56]. M-CSF, also known as CSF-1, through its receptor, CD115, influences several cell types and its effects include mediating the regulation, development, survival, proliferation and differentiation of M\u03a6 [57]. Culturing human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with M-CSF alone favors the differentiation of monocytes to M\u03a6. The outcome of PBMC culture with GM-CSF, on the other hand, depends on the density of GM-CSF receptors (GM-CSFR) on the surface of the monocytes; low GM-CSFR expression is associated with M\u03a6 differentiation, higher GM-CSFR density with differentiation towards DC. The addition of IL-4, which has a M-CSF inhibiting function, overrides the effect of different levels of GM-CSFR and blocks differentiation towards M\u03a6, thus favoring a DC phenotype [58], [59].",

The fate of monocytes in inflammatory scenarios such as EAE or viral encephalitis is difficult to predict due to the intricate interplay between cytokines, chemokines and receptor-ligand interactions. As would be expected, simulating an \u201cinflammatory\u201d environment by adding pro-inflammatory factors alters the differentiation outcome. In M-CSF- and GM-CSF-directed differentiation of BM monocytes (BMM) to M\u03a6, LPS induced high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, TNF and IL-23, from GM-BMM, whereas M-BMM produced higher levels of IL-10 and CCL2. This raises the possibility that GM-CSF-induced M\u03a6 represent differentiation down the Classical/M1 activated pathway and M-CSF-induced M\u03a6 represent differentiation down the Alternative/M2 regulatory pathway associated with IL-10 production. These two M\u03a6 populations were not terminally differentiated, as the addition or removal of M-CSF or GM-CSF to the relevant cultures results in an interchange between M\u03a6 phenotypes [68].",

            "text": "Current dogma suggests that GM-CSF is crucial for the differentiation of MDDC from inflammatory monocytes, and although this is true for several in vitro experiments, the in vivo scenario is markedly different. MDDC differentiation in the absence of GM-CSF was examined in several disease models in vivo, including infection with Influenza A, Streptococcus pneumonia, Salmonella typhimurium, L. monocytogenes, LPS stimulation and EAE [71]. CSF-2rb\u2212/\u2212 and CSF-2rb2\u2212/\u2212 mice in all these inflammatory scenarios had similar inflammatory DC numbers compared to wild type (WT) mice. These DC were identified as fully functional TipDC, indicating that GM-CSF is not required for monocyte accumulation and differentiation into DC during these inflammatory conditions. The authors did however detect high levels of M-CSFR and M-CSF levels on DC and in inflamed tissues, respectively. Removing the M-CSF signal by antibody blockade of M-CSF or the excision of M-CSFR allele did not alter the number of Ly6Chi monocytes infiltrating inflamed tissue. However, MDDC numbers were significantly reduced, indicating that M-CSFR signaling is likely critical for the differentiation of MDDC in vivo but not for the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes [71]. The importance of M-CSF in DC differentiation was also confirmed in an inflammatory skin model. UV irradiation resulted in homing of circulating GR1hi (Ly6C/G complex) monocytes to the inflamed dermis and epidermis, which differentiated into Langerhans cells (LC) upon entry. M-CSFR-deficient mice exhibited impaired LC differentiation and tissue M\u03a6 development. Although these mice had similar monocyte numbers homing to inflamed skin, they possessed significantly fewer LC, indicating that M-CSFR is directly involved in monocyte-to-DC differentiation in the skin [72].",

            "text": "During infection, inflammatory stimuli are not only derived from pathogens (e.g. LPS from bacteria) but cells from the host also contribute factors changing the microenvironment, which directly influence monocyte differentiation. The differentiation of monocytes derived from the blood occurs once they reach target tissue [72] and cross the endothelium [20]. Stromal cells like fibroblasts have been shown to impact upon this differentiation. Although monocytes cultured with GM-CSF and IL-4 yield DC [64], the co-culture of these cells with fibroblasts in steady-state conditions, skews the differentiation to M\u03a6. Monocytes, which become activated when they cross the endothelium, secrete M-CSF and stimulate the release of IL-6 from fibroblasts. IL-6 in turn increases the expression of functional M-CSFR responsible for transducing the M-CSF signal and thereby initiates M\u03a6 differentiation [73]. However, co-culturing these human PBMC with fibroblasts, IL-4, GM-CSF and TNF, induces a terminally differentiated DC phenotype. This occurs because IL-6 facilitates the utilization of M-CSF, whereas TNF induces the internalization of M-CSFR resulting in monocytes being unresponsive to autocrine IL-6 and M-CSF. These results suggest that the balance of the TNF/IL-6 may be crucial in determining the fate of monocytes during inflammation [73]. This is further supported by the overexpression of CCL2 in the brain induced by adeno-associated virus, which results in microglial activation and elevated IL-6 and GM-CSF levels [74]. IL-6, which is involved in monocyte-to-M\u03a6 differentiation, is elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid of JEV-infected patients [75]. Activated murine microglia in JEV and HSV infection release pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 [76], [77], [78]. This release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from microglia likely occurs via a RIG-I-mediated pathway [79]. Infiltrating M\u03a6 are also a major source of IL-6 in TMEV infection of mice; along with the IL-6 produced by microglia this might induce monocyte to M\u03a6 proliferation through an autocrine loop [47], [77]. High levels of IL-6 are present in the WNV-infected brain although it is not clear which cells produce it [80].",

These actively dying cells release soluble mediators, directing monocyte differentiation towards M\u03a6 [82]. The activation of the caspase pathway associated with apoptosis, has also been identified as playing a role in the fate of monocyte differentiation. Caspase-8 deletion arrested the M-CSF-induced differentiation of BM-derived monocytes to M\u03a6 [83]. Caspase-8 and caspase-9 were specifically activated in human PBMC stimulated with M-CSF to become M\u03a6 but not by GM-CSF and IL-4. Treatment with a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor induced a switch from M\u03a6 differentiation to death, further implicating these proteins as crucial factors in the pathway of monocyte differentiation [84]. Human cytomegalovirus-stimulated monocytes relied on caspase-3 rather than the caspase-8 activation seen in M-CSF-induced differentiation [85]. This raises the possibility that infected neurons undergoing apoptosis may skew the differentiation of infiltrating monocytes towards a M\u03a6 phenotype.",

Differentiation of monocytes into either M\u03a6 or DC in vivo can be triggered indirectly by the recognition of microbial ligands by pattern recognition receptors (PRR) or directly by cytokine activation. PRR are a very diverse group of receptors that function by signalling from a cell membrane or cytoplasmic location, or following endocytosis of pathogens in order to destroy them. TLR are important and abundant PRR on monocytes that contribute crucially to the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses. Binding of microbial or viral products by TLR results in dimerization of the receptors and the subsequent triggering of intracellular signalling pathways that operate via NF-\u03baB and MAP kinase pathways and result in the production and release of cytokines potentially inducing M\u03a6 or DC differentiation. Both TLR2/1 and IL-1\u03b2 receptor signalling have been implicated in monocyte differentiation through the common MyD88 signalling pathway. Impairing TLR-4 signalling by using tunicamycin-induced ER stress to suppress NF-\u03baB activation, markedly suppressed the ability of LPS-stimulated monocytes to differentiate into M\u03a6 [86].",

Netea et al. showed that IL-32 directly induced the differentiation of monocytes to a cell type that exhibited the morphology and functionality of a M\u03a6 but possessed some DC-specific markers [93]. Interestingly, NOD2L activation primarily induced the differentiation of human PBMC to CD1b+ DC, whereas TLR2/1 activation resulted in both M\u03a6 and DC populations. The DC derived from NOD2L-activated cells were superior APC to TLR2/1-induced DC. Transfection with siRNA resulting in the knockdown of IL-32 RNA, subsequently blocked the NOD2L- but not TLR2/1-mediated differentiation of PBMC into CD1b+ DC. In this study, increased IL-32 mRNA and NOD2 expression in patients with T-Lep correlated with higher CD1b+ DC numbers present in lesions. This identifies NOD2L-induced IL-32 as a distinct pathway of DC differentiation in humans [94]. Thus, IL-1\u03b2 seems to be a more potent stimulator of monocyte-to-M\u03a6 differentiation, whereas TLR2/1 and especially NOD2 favor differentiation to DC.",

            "text": "Interferon regulatory factors (IRF), which are activated by TLR and RIG-1-like receptors, are transcription factors playing a crucial role in host defense mainly by controlling the production of IFN [95], [96]. Increased IRF expression can be found in several CNS pathologies associated with M\u03a6 or DC infiltration, although the extent to which these factors may be involved in modulating the monocyte differentiation in the CNS has not been examined. IRF-7 is crucial for the control of WNV infection and spread to the CNS [97] and along with IRF-9 and -5 is upregulated in lymphocytic choriomeningitis infection [98]. IRF-3 is necessary to control viral replication and IL-6 production in TMEV [99] and flaviviruses such as JEV and dengue virus can induce IRF-3, -7 and -1 in culture, respectively. Although in the periphery IRF-7 is mainly expressed in pDC, in the CNS IRF-7 can be upregulated on neurons during viral encephalitis and correlates with Type I IFN production [100]. However, increased IRF-7 gene expression is also present in EAE CNS disease progression, with the absence of IRF-7 associated with increased severity of disease and M\u03a6 infiltration [101]. IRF-8 is well known for its role in the differentiation of non-monocyte-derived DC and maturation of myeloid DC [102], [103], [104], as well as the normal differentiation of microglia [105]. There are several examples of IRF-7 and -8 directing monocyte differentiation to M\u03a6 in vitro\n[106], [107]. Interestingly, IRF-8 has been shown to negatively regulate TLR3, which is constitutively expressed upon monocyte-to-DC differentiation. IRF-8 and IRF-1 compete for binding, which induces TLR3 promoter activity on MDDC [108]. IRF-4, in turn, has been associated with monocyte-to-MDDC differentiation in vitro\n[109], [110]. Although no established link has been made between IRF in the CNS and monocyte differentiation, in vitro studies suggest that these factors might form a link in the sequence of events steering monocyte differentiation during viral infection or autoimmune disease.",

However, IFN-\u03b3 has also been implicated in M\u03a6 induction. NK cells isolated from the blood of patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis induced differentiation of monocytes into DC in a cell contact-, GM-CSF- and CD154-dependent manner. These MDDC differ phenotypically from DC obtained from in vitro culture of monocytes with GM-CSF and IL-4, but still efficiently presented antigen and activated CD4+ T cells, which were polarized toward Th1 [111].

Activation and function of this subset was severely impaired in T. gondii-infected CXCR3 knockout (KO) mice and disease symptoms were exacerbated. CXCR3 KO mice also show impaired recruitment of CD4+ T cells and production of IFN-\u03b3 by these cells. CXCR3 was identified as important for CD4+ T cell trafficking and consequent IFN-\u03b3 production in inflamed intestine. Adoptively transferred IFN+/+ CD4+ T cells but not IFN\u2212/\u2212 CD4+ T cells restored Ly6C+ monocyte function and activation [114]. NK cell-produced IFN-\u03b3 may also regulate the differentiation of monocytes to DC, and IL-12 production during intraperitoneal infection with T. gondii. These experiments identify IFN-\u03b3, produced by either NK or CD4+ T cells, as a key player in monocyte activation and differentiation to DC during inflammation [113], [114]. In the autoimmune scenario represented by EAE, CXCR3 KO mice also presented with exacerbated disease; however, in contrast to the effect of CXCR3 deletion in T. gondii infection, the number of T cells trafficking to the CNS was not affected. In EAE and MS, infiltrating activated T cells expressing CXCR3 are attracted to CXCR3 ligands, CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 produced in and around the perivascular space and are thus restricted to this location. Deletion of CXCR3 leads to uncontrolled spread of T cells throughout the CNS but also reduces the recruitment of Foxp3+ T cells and effector T cell interaction, and therefore results in more severe autoimmune-mediated tissue damage [115].",

            "text": "Although the factors determining monocyte fate are not completely understood, studies to date strongly suggest that multiple factors at the site of differentiation, including those secreted by resident and immune effector cells, play crucial roles in this process. Clear differences between mediators in an infectious setting, such as viral encephalitis, and the autoimmune response, which drives EAE, likely determine the outcome of monocyte differentiation into M\u03a6 or DC, respectively. These differences may also affect the mechanisms by which the CNS mobilizes monocytes in the bone marrow. As monocyte differentiation can have both protective and immunopathological outcomes in CNS disease, it is crucial to gain better insight into defining factors that govern differentiation to inform more tailored approaches for intervention in these diseases.",
