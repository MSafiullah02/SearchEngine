It is highly likely that all autotransporters share a common translocation mechanism for the following reasons: first, they share features across all the different stages of translocation. This has allowed one to connect individual discoveries from one subset of the family to others. Second, they share an N-terminal signal sequence for Sec-dependent translocation into the periplasm, a central passenger domain with various functional domains, and a conserved outer membrane channel-forming \u03b2-barrel at the C-terminus that is required for the export of the passenger domain to the outside [9]. Third, the C-terminal domain always resembles OMP85 family of proteins, which are monomeric proteins with a structurally conserved 12-stranded \u03b2-barrel in the outer membrane. In TAAs, each monomer in the obligate trimer contributes four \u03b2-strands to the final barrel [10], but the nature of the \u03b2-barrel remains the same.",

            "text": "All type V secretion proteins pass the inner membrane via the Sec machinery. They are recognized by an N-terminal signal peptide, which is cleaved after translocation [10]. For most autotransporters, the signal peptide consists of a stretch of 20\u201330 amino acids that has a basic N-terminal region, a hydrophobic core, and a somewhat polar C-terminus but is highly variable in sequence. TAAs contain an N-terminal extension to the typical signal peptide [11]. This extension has implications in the transport process across the periplasmic space as it inhibits signal recognition particle (SRP) binding, slowing down the transport across the inner membrane [12]. This kinetic constraint may help to recruit periplasmic chaperones and the inner-membrane anchored protein TamB of the translocation and assembly module. We speculate that this prevents premature folding of TAAs in the periplasm and subsequent degradation of these proteins by periplasmic proteases.",

            "text": "Outer membrane translocation of TAAs is initiated by the formation of a hairpin structure originating at the C-terminus of the passenger domain [13], which is also the area of highest sequence conservation among TAAs. The energy of translocation has to come from the folding process of the autotransporter itself, as the periplasm is devoid of ATP and no pH gradient exists at the outer membrane which could provide the energy for this process. This implies a mechanism in which the translocation is coupled to the export process at both membranes, similar to the Lpt pathway that transports lipopolysaccharides across both membranes [14]. As the C-terminal end of the passenger domain emerges from the \u03b2-barrel first, free energy can be obtained from \u201cpulling out\u201d the rest of the passenger domain from the barrel pore in a sequential manner [15]. This progressive folding model prevents retrograde slipping into the periplasmic space but also depends on additional factors to translocate passenger domains with intrinsically disordered domains. To obtain a complete model of translocation for TAAs, TAM and BAM must be considered as well as the Sec translocon and the periplasmic chaperones.",

            "text": "Translocation competence of autotransporter can be affected by the folding state of passenger domains in the periplasm. This was shown by experiments on chimeric passenger domains of the type Va cholera toxin B subunit fused with the N. gonorrhoeae IgA protease \u03b2-barrel domain in which the passenger domain could only be secreted when reducing agents were present which would disrupt disulphide bridges that would otherwise hinder translocation [16]. In TAAs, the A354P mutation in the C-terminal region of YadA affected translocation and folding competence even though the \u03b2-barrel domain was still inserted into the outer membrane [17]. These two examples show that even small changes to the autotransporter molecule can affect the translocation efficiency significantly. Further studies have led to the following general rules for translocation of passenger domains: (1) the sequence of the C-terminal region of the passenger domain is very important [18], (2) the net charge of the passenger domain influences the periplasmic folding state [19], and (3) secretion kinetics and translocation efficiency are correlated [20]. These findings need to be considered when creating chimeric proteins for surface display as recently shown by the creation of an affibody library fused to the translocator domain of the autotransporter Adhesin Involved in Diffuse Adherence (AIDA-I). Here, the authors exchange the passenger domain of the autotransporter AIDA-I from Escherichia coli with the \u201caffibody\u201d library system; affibodies are small (< 10 kDa), inert antibody mimetics each with a unique antigen binding site. This can potentially complement methods like phage display in the search for high affinity binding modules [21].",

This is further highlighted by the fact that the BAM complex is responsible for the insertion of all transmembrane pore domains of type V secretion systems [8] with BamA as the central component in autotransporter biogenesis for trimeric autotransporters [23]. In the case of TAAs, trimerization of the \u03b2-barrel seems to occur in the periplasm [24]. This is consistent with the presence of trimeric periplasmic helper proteins like the inner membrane lipoprotein SadB, which is required for the TAA SadA to be displayed on the surface of Salmonella typhimurium [25] or the trimeric chaperone Skp of E. coli which forms 1:1 complexes with OMPs [26].

In contrast to tamA, tamB homologs are present in most, if not all gram-negative pathogens [35].

They vary dramatically in size with YadA (422 aa) being one of the shorter TAAs with a length of about 23 nm [36], while BadA (3082 aa) is one of the longest TAAs, with a length of about 240 nm [37]. This initial classification originated from the assumption that the head domain, rich in \u03b2-strands, is the sole effector of protein function. It was thought that the stalk domain, formed from an \u03b1-helical coiled coil extended beyond the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) layer of gram-negative pathogens to allow the head domain to interact with various host factors [38]. While the head domains do mediate many molecular interactions ranging from autoagglutination to the attachment to extracellular matrix (ECM) components, the stalk domains also contribute; for instance the stalk of BadA binds to fibronectin [39] and two different regions of the stalk of EibD bind to IgA and IgG, respectively [40]. Therefore, to identify the interaction partners of a TAA, all regions of the passenger domain, not just the N-terminal head domains, must be considered.",

The other type of structure is the \u03b2-prism module with each wall of the trimer being composed of a set of five \u03b2-strands. This structural element is present for example in the head domain of Bartonella henselae autotransporter BadA (GIN, Fig. 2e) [42].

However, parts of passenger domains of one TAA often have high structural similarity to parts of another TAA, even if the similarity cannot be seen based on the sequence. One example are the left-handed \u03b2-roll \u201chead domains\u201d of Hia and BadA: they have superimposable folds but sequence identity of just 20% [42]. The structures cannot diverge as they have to trimerize in their native state, and the trimers are not formed by independently folded-domains, but by highly intertwined \u03b2-sheets and coiled-coil stalk domains [43]. This leads to the presence of short, structure-driven sequence patterns. Lupas and colleagues developed the bioinformatic tool daTAA [44], which treats domains of TAAs like a dictionary: short motifs or features are identified and compared to structures of representative exemplars for each domain. Conserved motifs allow the identification of structural elements by just \u201creading\u201d the sequence of the passenger domain without any a priori information about the structure of the protein itself. This domain conservation can also be extended to other proteins, like the TrpRing and GIN domain of Hia and BadA which show yet again superimposable folds [31]. The number of common motifs for head and neck domains has been expanded, with motifs being split up in fine-grained submotifs as shown for the various neck domains (Table 1).",

Structures of uncharacterized proteins can, therefore, be solved by a divide-and-conquer approach with individual fragments of head, connector, and stalk domains being combined to generate a complete model.

Furthermore, FGG motifs occur in BpaC as they do in BpaA (3la9, [47]), where they introduce a 120\u00b0 rotation of the two linked coiled-coil segments. The identification of coiled-coils is made simple by the occurrence of neck motifs with the (DAVNxxQL) consensus, which in the published TAA structures signify the start of a coiled-coil segment as in BpaB (4usx, [48]).

            "text": "Burkholderia pseudomallei is a motile gram-negative pathogen that lives in dead organic matter in tropical and sub-tropical soils and water [56]. It causes melioidosis, which is a febrile illness with acute and chronic disease states with a high mortality rate. B. pseudomallei can infect humans via the cutaneous or aerosol route upon contact with infected horses [57]. A major focus of research is on the prevention of infection by B. pseudomallei, as it is considered a potential bioweapon due to its ability to readily form infectious aerosols and the very low infectious dose required [58, 59], there has been an increase in research efforts, leading to successful vaccination in 2018 of mice using a live attenuated strain of B. pseudomallei expressing the trimeric autotransporter protein BatA, protecting them from a harmful aerosol infection [60]. Consequently, autotransporters are important in the virulence of this pathogen, implying that they may be targets for vaccine development against other gram-negative bacteria in the future. Although the majority of autotransporters in B. pseudomallei play some role in the virulence of the pathogen, only the TAA BpaC seems not only to increase virulence, but also to protect against macrophages and enhance serum survival [56]. Lafontaine et al. [61] showed in a series of adherence assays with human respiratory epithelial cells that deletion or overexpression of bpaC has different effects on the adhesion properties of the pathogen depending on the strain in which it is expressed. This strain-specific selectivity for certain types of epithelial cells implies either that there are other adhesion molecules compensating for the effect of the bpaC knockout deletion in B. pseudomallei compared to B. mallei or that other factors like a difference in thickness and composition of the LPS layer are responsible for the protein\u2019s behaviour [62]. There is clearly a need for elucidating the exact molecular mode of action of this protein. Thus, BpaC is of particular interest in fully understanding B. pseudomallei pathogenicity.",

BpaC fulfils various functions that allow the bacterium to adhere to certain epithelial cells, to survive and to proliferate in the host environment. Each function can be encoded on a different domain (Fig. 2): we speculate that this modular design allows the bacterium\u2014in evolutionarily short timescales\u2014to adapt to changes in the environment or the host. The structural conservation of trimeric autotransporter domains allows one to cross-correlate functional studies between two seemingly unrelated TAAs which make them of particular interest for the drug discovery pipeline from the structural biology point of view. A promising approach has been the development of a vaccine containing a recombinant virus that expresses the Va autotransporter BatA from B. pseudomallei as an antigen vector [60]. Studies in mice using this approach cleared an otherwise lethal aerosol dose of B. pseudomallei and B. mallei. The method also can serve as a blueprint for vaccination trials against other autotransporter antigens like BpaC.",

One successful bacterial vaccine is the multicomponent vaccine 4CMenB, which protects against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B. Components of the vaccine target specifically the interaction of the TAA Neisserial adhesin A3 (NadA3) with its binding partner, the human receptor LOX-1. Liguori et al. [63] were able to demonstrate the specificity of NadA3 for LOX-1 by solving the structure of the N-terminal head domain and parts of the stalk of NadA3 and comparing it with the closely related TAA NadA5. This enabled them to identify key residues that explain the specificity of NadA3 towards LOX-1 [63]. A combination of functional studies and structural techniques demonstrates the power of structural-based vaccine design in the field of TAAs.",
