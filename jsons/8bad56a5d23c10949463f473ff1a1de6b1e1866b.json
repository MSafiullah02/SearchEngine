            "text": "Objective To retrospectively analyze the chest computed tomography (CT) features in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. Methods From January 9, 2020, to February 26, 2020, totally 56 laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19 underwent chest CT. For 40 patients, follow-up CT scans were obtained. The CT images were evaluated for the number, type and distribution of the opacity, and the affected lung lobes. Furthermore, the initial CT scan and the follow-up CT scans were compared. Results Forty patients (83.6%) had two or more opacities in the lung. Eighteen (32.7%) patients had only ground-glass opacities; twenty-nine patients (52.7%) had ground-glass and consolidative opacities; and eight patients (14.5%) had only consolidation. A total of 43 patients (78.2%) showed two or more lobes involved. The opacities tended to be both in peripheral and central (30/55, 54.5%) or purely peripheral distribution (25/55, 45.5%). Fifty patients (90.9%) had the lower lobe involved. The first follow-up CT scans showed that twelve patients (30%) had improvement, 26 (65%) patients had mild-moderate progression, and two patients (5%) had severe progression with \"white lungs.\" The second follow-up CT showed that 22 patients (71%) showed improvement compared with the first follow-up CT, four patients (12.9%) had aggravated progression, and five patients (16.1%) showed unchanged radiographic appearance. Conclusions The common CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia are multiple lung opacities, multiple types of the opacity (ground-glass, ground-glass and consolidation, and consolidation alone), and multiple lobes especially the lower lobe involved. Follow-up CT could demonstrate the rapid progression of COVID-19 pneumonia (either in aggravation or absorption). Key Points \u2022 The predominant CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia are multiple ground-glass opacities with or without consolidation and, with both lungs, multiple lobes and especially the lower lobe affected. \u2022 CT plays a crucial role in early diagnosis and assessment of COVID-19 pneumonia progression.",

            "text": "In mid-December 2019, a cluster of unidentified pneumonia cases named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China, with clinical symptoms resembling viral pneumonia. Real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of respiratory specimens revealed a novel beta corona virus to be present, which has subsequently been named severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the World Health Organization (WHO) [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . COVID-19 pneumonia is characterized by fast spread, wide epidemic range, and major respiratory dysfunction. The number of reported cases rose rapidly and by 26 February 2020, there were more than 78,100 confirmed cases (65,596 in Hubei Province) with 2718 deaths (2104 in Hubei) reported, and with an additional 2019 suspected cases in China [6] . In addition, 2918 confirmed cases had appeared in many other countries throughout the world [6] . Global attention was soon focused on the situation because of the increasing number of new cases and the high death rate associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Early diagnosis will enable patients to be isolated and treated in good time, essential for avoiding the spread of disease, improving prognosis, and reducing mortality. Thus, early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia is of great significance.",

Furthermore, some of the original ground-glass opacities begin to consolidate. Thus, ground-glass opacities and consolidation are commonly seen. At this stage, if the patients could not receive effective treatment promptly or if the immunity is low, COVID-19 pneumonia may be life-threatening. CT images may show diffuse opacities to be present in both lungs and *Numbers in parentheses are percentages in severe cases so-called white lung manifestation. However, there are fewer patients in the stage. In the study, only two cases showed \"white lungs.\" If the patient accepts effective treatment or if immunity is enhanced, pneumonia will be gradually absorbed and the opacity will be diminished [14] . The disease will improve, possibly leaving the lung fibrous stripes and thickened pleural. In the present study, 40 patients were cured and discharged and before discharge, the RT-PCR test result for each patient was negative and the appearance of opacities in both lungs was improved and their size obviously diminished. Nevertheless, we found that COVID-19 pneumonia has many similar CT features to those reported with SARS [15, 16] and MERS [17, 18] ; thus, it is difficult to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from them. Our findings were in accordance with the present studies [12, 19] . It is not surprising since the responsible viruses of SARS and MERS are also coronaviruses and viruses in the same viral family have similar pathogenesis.",

Therefore, when the result of the RT-PCR test is negative for a patient with CT features typical of viral pneumonia and history of potential exposure, the patient should be isolated, closely observed, and undergo further RT-PCR testing.",

Their CT images revealed multiples opacities to be present in the lungs, and subsequently, they also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on a RT-PCR test. In addition, some patients showed obvious improvements of symptoms after receiving treatment but the follow-up CT suggested there would have been a significant progression. Therefore, for some suspicious patients with mild clinical symptoms, CT examination is recommended for the detection of lesions, early diagnosis, and assessment of the disease Air bronchograms 20 28 Fibrous stripes 3 13 progression. Moreover, follow-up CT scans should be performed for evaluating the efficacy of treatment during hospitalization. Incidentally, we additionally found that COVID-19 pneumonia showed obvious characteristics of crowd aggregation, especially family aggregation in that sixteen patients who were members of just five families were all infected with SARS-CoV-2.",
