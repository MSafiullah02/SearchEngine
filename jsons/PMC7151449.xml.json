These mainly encode four major structural proteins: the spike (S), nucleocapsid, membrane, and envelope proteins. The S protein is a glycoprotein and can form homotrimers to mediate membrane fusion and gain entry into host cells (Bosch et al., 2003). It is known that the S protein of coronavirus plays a crucial role in the induction of neutralizing antibodies, and it has been used to prepare effective vaccines (Brian and Baric, 2005; Tuboly and Nagy, 2001). The amino-terminal portion of the S protein of several coronaviruses has been shown to contain key antigenic sites that are responsible for eliciting humoral and cellular immune responses (Gebauer et al., 1991).",

Antibodies of the secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) class act as the first line of antigen-specific immunity in the gut, and can recognize both pathogens and commensals (Song and Park, 2012). In contrast to serum IgA, which is derived from plasma cells in the bone marrow, SIgA is generated locally by plasma cells in the lamina propria, which lies beneath the intestinal epithelium (Kaetzel, 2005). The protective action of SIgA in the infant gut is a result of many processes, including intracellular neutralization and viral particle excretion, immune exclusion, whereby SIgA agglutinates bacteria and viruses, as well as prevents the binding of pathogens to mucosal surfaces, and interference with bacterial motility (van Egmond et al., 2001v). At high endogenous concentrations of SIgA, infants are less likely to have experienced illness in the preceding and subsequent months (Breakey et al., 2015).",

Tools to monitor PEDV mucosal immunity and colostral immunity could be useful for the development of preventative programs on affected farms. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a simple and rapid immunochromatographic test strip incorporating a colloidal gold-labeled anti-SIgA SC mAb probe for the detection of anti-PEDV-specific SIgA in swine, and to compare its performance with an indirect SIgA ELISA based on the whole PEDV virus (Cong et al., 2019).",

The conjugate pad was covered with an appropriate volume of colloidal gold-labeled anti-SIgA SC mAbs (2F9) using a XYZ3060 dispense platform (BioDot, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA), and then dried at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h and stored dry. Purified PEDV particles were dispensed onto the nitrocellulose (NC) membrane to serve as the test line, and goat anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody (pAb) was dispensed onto the NC membrane, (being separated by a distance of 7 mm) to serve as the control line. The PEDV particles and goat anti-mouse IgG pAb were diluted with coating buffer to a final concentration of 0.02 and 1.0 mg/mL, respectively. Then, the NC membrane was dried at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h and stored in the dry at room temperature until use.",

IgA plays an important role in providing protection at mucosal surfaces, and it is effective in neutralizing bacterial toxins. Furthermore, polymeric IgA has been shown to be more effective at neutralizing exotoxins from Clostridium difficile when compared to either monomeric IgA or IgG with the same variable regions (Stubbe et al., 2000). SIgA consists of the SC, two IgA molecules, and a linking chain. SC protects SIgA from proteolytic degradation (Kaetzel, 2005), making the SIgA more stable. It has been estimated that approximately 3 g of SIgA is transported daily into the intestines of the average adult (Mestecky et al., 1986; Conley and Delacroix, 1987), where SIgA forms the first line of antigen-specific immune protection against ingested, inhaled, or sexually transmitted pathogens and antigens at mucosal surfaces (Kaetzel, 2005), making it more important than IgA. In this study, we investigated the SC portion to detect SIgA in colostrum samples, as this can eliminate the effect of monomeric IgA.",

By determining the SIgA level, we could assess whether pig herds (Unvaccinated) have been infected by PEDV, as well as pigs (vaccinated) could been protected against PEDV, highlighting the versatility of our method.",
