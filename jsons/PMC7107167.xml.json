            "text": "Female turkeys (hens), like chicken hens and other female birds, are able to \u201cstore\u201d sperm in their reproductive tracts after copulation, thus allowing the continuous fertilization of eggs as they are produced over a period of weeks (Bobr et al., 1964a,b; Bakst, 1998; Sasanami et al., 2013). The sperm are stored where the turkey hen's vagina meets the shell gland (uterus), the uterovaginal junction (UVJ), in specialized invaginations of the surface epithelium termed sperm storage tubules (SST). Two salient biological questions about turkey SSTs remain to be fully understood: how they maintain sperm viability over time and how they release sperm.",

            "text": "Cell and molecular biology studies being conducted by multiple laboratories around the world seek to answer these fundamental questions, and in vitro models of SST could contribute to these efforts. Presently, in vitro models of the SSTs of turkeys or chickens do not exist. Numerous examples of the short-term cell culture or organ culture of chicken UVJ, infundibulum, magnum, and shell gland (uterus) epithelium have been published, and they encompassed a wide array of scientific investigations (Ashizawa et al., 1976; Ashizawa and Nishiyama, 1983; Seaver et al., 1984; Sanders and McKnight, 1985; Jung-Testas et al., 1986; Jung et al., 2011; Kasperczyk et al., 2012; Ariyadi et al., 2013; Mork et al., 2014). The report of Kasperczyk et al., (2012) detailed several approaches to the primary culture, in a monolayer format, of chicken magnum or infundibulum tissue after various mechanical cell harvesting methods combined with collagenase digestion. Also of note is the paper by Jung et al., (2011), where the effects of hormone treatments on magnum epithelial cells were examined, because the authors established the cells as finite cell lines and sustained their continuous culture for 25 passages for cells from juvenile hens (10 wk old) and for at least 6 passages from mature hens (30 wk old). In contrast to the chicken, apparently, no reports exist for the turkey concerning the culture of oviductal tissues other than a published method for the isolation of individual SSTs that was proposed to be useful as the starting point for in vitro studies (King et al., 1999).",

The UVJ tissue was dissected from the reproductive tract as previously described (Bakst, 1992). Briefly, the uterus and vagina were dissected from the reproductive tract together, and the extraneous connective tissue was removed from the UVJ before cutting longitudinally with scissors to expose the mucosa containing the SSTs.

N4888; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and supplemented with 12% v/v fetal bovine serum (FBS; Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA) and 2 mM L-glutamine (12% DMEM/F12). Primary cultures of SST cells were begun by transferring the UVJ tissue sections to a 35-mm plastic petri dish containing 12% DMEM/F12 medium. Individual SSTs were dissected from the UVJ tissue sections using 27 G hypodermic needles while under observation through a binocular dissection microscope (Nikon, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Single SSTs were transferred to various culture substrates and media conditions using a mouth-controlled, finely drawn, sterile, Pasteur pipet. All primary SST cell cultures were established as explants cultures in 4-well culture plates (Nalgen Nunc International, Rochester, NY) placed in cell culture incubators (Sanyo Scientific, Osaka, Japan) with a 92.5% air/7.5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37\u00b0C. The cultures\u2019 media were exchanged with fresh 12% DMEM/F12 medium every 2 to 3 d. Culture substrates included a thin layer of polymerized collagen type I (PureCol, Advanced Matrix, Inc., San Diego, CA) prepared as previously described (Talbot et al., 2010a), a thin-layer (1:40 dilution in 12% DMEM/F12) of Matrigel (Becton/Dickson, Lincoln Park, NJ), and mouse fibroblast feeder layers. The preparation of feeder cells was as previously described using 8 Krad of gamma radiation to inactivate Sandoz inbred strain, thioguanine- and ouabain-resistance (STO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (CRL 1503, American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) or primary cultures of CF-1 strain mouse fibroblasts (Talbot et al., 2012). Stock STO and CF-1 cells were grown in 10% DMEM high glucose (Hyclone) supplemented with 4 mM L-glutamine (Hyclone) and penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Grand Island, NY). Feeder layers consisted of irradiated STO or CF-1 cells plated at 2.5 \u00d7 104 cells/cm2 and maintained with weekly feeding of 10% DMEM until use for the culture of SST cells.",

Either trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [trypsin-EDTA (0.05% trypsin/0.2 g/l EDTA\u20224Na); Hyclone, ThermoFisher] or Accutase dissociation solution (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to dissociate the SST cells from one another and their culture substrate.

In all cases, at least some individual SST attached to each of the substrates over a 24 h period in culture. The cells of the SST slowly spread out over each substrate in 3 to 5 d. Those SST cells cultured on bare tissue culture plastic slowly enlarged because of the colony's individual cells spreading out flatter and flatter over a period of weeks in primary culture until the cells lost any semblance of normal epithelial morphology, i.e., cuboidal cells. The cells of SSTs plated on polymerized collagen or Matrigel did not flatten out and retained an epithelial morphology for a period of at least 2 to 3 wk, but these primary colonies did not noticeably proliferate. Only the SST explant cultures on STO feeder cells appeared to be continuously dividing over the first 2 to 3 wk of primary culture.",

Presumably the ciliated cells were from UVJ lumenal epithelial cells that remained attached to the proximal end of the SSTs because the SST epithelium was found to be composed of non-ciliated cells in its entirety (see ultrastructure analysis below; Schuppin et al., 1984). Thus, despite every effort to dissect only the SST epithelium, some of the UVJ epithelium, consisting of ciliated epithelial cells and mucus-secreting epithelial cells, must have contaminated the SST cells established in the explant cultures. The cilia of the multiciliated cells beat continuously for the entirety of the primary culture period (2 to 3 wk with refeeding every 48 h), but their numbers did not increase in the primary explant colony outgrowths. Also, the ciliated cells did not survive, or, alternatively, they did not regenerate their cilia, after the first secondary passage of the cultures using trypsin-EDTA as the dissociating agent.",

The SST-1 and SST-2 cell lines were established from whole-dissected SSTs that in their primary outgrowth had contaminating ciliated cells present. The SST-3 cell line was distinct in being cultured from the \u201ctip-end\u201d distal portion of an SST, to avoid any contamination of the SST-3 cell line by UVJ ciliated or mucus-secreting cells, i.e., epithelial cells lining the lumen of the UVJ. Secondary passage of SST primary outgrowths also revealed that dissociation of the primary SST cells from the underlying substrate and themselves resulted in catastrophic cell blebbing, as with the dissociation of primary pig epiblast cells or human embryonic stem cells from one another (Talbot and Garrett, 2001; Watanabe et al., 2007). Pretreatment of the SST cultures with ROCK inhibitor, Y27632, prevented the catastrophic blebbing and enabled the SST cells to survive and reattach in new flasks. Secondary culture of the cells also confirmed that only the SST cells grown on STO feeder layers continued to divide to increase their numbers. These non-ciliated, closely knit epithelial cells were dividing and doubled in their total numbers of cells several times. The primary outgrowths were expanded to T12.5 flasks containing STO feeder cells and finite cell lines were established that were capable of being passaged up to at least 8 times and being expanded to millions of cells (Figures 1B and 2). After 10 to 12 passages, however, the cell lines growth slowed with the cell population apparently becoming senescent. The 3 SST cell lines, each established from an independent turkey reproductive tract, were readily cryopreserved and were frozen at the third passage level for later culture and analysis.",

Potential enhancement of growth rate was assessed by microscopic observations. Adult chicken serum (10% v/v) in place of FBS in the DMEM/F12 medium did not improve the growth of the SST-1 cells. Amendment of the FBS-containing 12% DMEM/F12 medium with estradiol (100 nM), progesterone (20 ng/mL), epidermal growth factor (100 ng/mL), leukemia inhibitory factor (10 ng/mL), or basic fibroblast growth factor (8 ng/mL) for a 2-wk period did not obviously change of the rate of growth of the SST-2 cell line. Reducing the height of the medium in the flasks, to increase the oxygen content of the medium at the level of the cells (Taylor and Camalier, 1982; Pettersen et al., 2005; Oze et al., 2012), had no observable effect on growth rate. The opposite condition of culturing in a low oxygen atmosphere (5% v/v) also did not appear to improve the growth rate. However, growth rate of the SST cells was increased at a lower, slightly acidic pH (Figure 2). The 12% DMEM/F12 medium typically had a pH of approximately 6.9 when incubated at 37\u00b0C in a 7.5% CO2 atmosphere. This was a result of the F12 component of the medium not containing any sodium bicarbonate. Therefore, our \u201cstandard\u201d 12% DMEM/F12 medium had additional sodium bicarbonate added to it to adjust the pH of the medium to the \u201cnormal\u201d physiological level of pH 7.3. Thus, without the added sodium bicarbonate the cells grew much better (Figure 2). Figure 2 also illustrates that the cells usually grew to an approximate 50% of confluent condition over a 7 to 10 d culture period after each passage.",

Adjacent cells had numerous interdigitating cytoplasmic folds at their lateral surfaces (Figure 3A and B), and there was not a well-developed basement membrane associated with the bottom of the cells. The cells were polarized in character with apical microvilli and numerous secretory vesicles typical of mucus-containing vesicles in the upper half of the cells, often amassed under the apical cell membrane (Figure 3A and C). Positive PAS staining of the SST-1 and -2 cell sheet was consistent with the vesicles being mucus-containing vesicles (Figure 1C). No cilia were observed on the cells. Cell organelles that were well represented in the cells\u2019 cytoplasm were mitochondria with flat cristae, Golgi apparatus, usually arranged around the nuclei of the cells, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and relatively small lipid vacuoles.

            "text": "The better propagation of the SST cell lines at relatively acidic pH (approximately 6.9) may reflect the pH of the turkey UVJ which was reported to range from pH 6.93 min after oviposition to pH 7.24, 8 to 12 h postoviposition (Bakst, 1980). Similarly, the chicken UVJ pH ranged from 6.92 to 7.18 (Bakst, 1980). Also, in the chicken, mating with insemination was found to upregulate numerous genes involved with pH regulation (Atikuzzaman et al., 2015). It has also been shown that the motility of sperm from domestic birds is effectively inhibited by lowering the pH in vitro (Holm and Wishart, 1998), and this has been proposed as a possible mechanism for making sperm quiescent in vivo in the oviduct's SSTs (Holm et al., 1996).",

Moreover, the cells of the SST cell lines adopted a non\u2013in vivo-like secretory phenotype, i.e., mucus vacuole production and secretion (Figures 3 and 4; Schuppin et al., 1984). Our electron microscopy examinations of UVJ tissues from 4 turkey hens in egg production, 2 inseminated and 2 non-inseminated, confirmed past studies of chicken and turkey SST cell morphology. After sampling multiple SSTs in their longitudinal aspect, it was unequivocal that the columnar epithelial cells comprising the turkey SSTs were non-ciliated, as previously reported (Schuppin et al., 1984), had a pronounced lipid vacuole over most nuclei, also as previously reported (Schuppin et al., 1984), and appeared to be non-secretory in character\u2014also as previously described for the SSTs of birds and reptiles (Schuppin et al., 1984; Bakst, 1998; Sever and Hamlett, 2002).",

The turkey proteins found in the SST SFCM were disappointing in being mostly cytoplasmic proteins common to most cells (Table 1). Similarly, the 2D-gel survey of the cellular proteins from a crude cell lysate of SST-1 cells resulted in the identification of mostly common cellular proteins. However, taken together, the proteomic analysis revealed some proteins of interest, either as marker proteins or for their potential biological function. Two groups of proteins identified as turkey that were of possible note were cytokeratins (types 1, 2, and 6A; Table 1) and annexins (A2, A4, A5, and A8; Table 1). Cytokeratins confirmed the epithelial nature of the cells (Moll et al., 1982). The annexins could be of significance because annexin-A1 and -A2 were detected on the surface epithelium of the avian oviduct and in gene expression analysis of the chicken egg gland (Chailley and Pradel, 1992; Yang et al., 2007). Also, annexin-A1, -A2, -A4, and -A5 are involved with sperm/oviductal cell adhesion and release in other species (reviewed in Talevi and Gualtieri, 2010).",

AGR-2 can be a secreted protein, and it is strongly expressed in mucus-secreting tissues, which is consistent with the observation of the numerous mucus vesicles in the SST cell line cells (Park et al., 2009; Li et al., 2012a). AGR-2 may also be significant because it was found to have specific expression in the avian oviduct (Kim et al., 2007), its expression interrelated with estrogen and the estrogen receptor (Vanderlaag et al., 2010; Bu et al., 2013), and it has been shown to be involved with cell growth, tissue repair, and tissue regeneration (Wodziak et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2017).

Exosome-mediated secretion of HSP90 (Takeuchi et al., 2015) supports its potential involvement in the hypothetical support of sperm in the SSTs by the SST epithelium's robust microvillar exosome (extracellular vesicle) production (Figure 4; Schuppin et al., 1984; Bakst and Bauchan, 2015).",

Briefly, MIF treatment of human sperm was found to inhibit sperm capacitation and decrease sperm motility (Carli et al., 2007). Both these effects are proposed to be fundamental to the function of the turkey's SSTs in their storage of sperm (Bakst, 1998; Sasanami et al., 2013). Clusterin is a chaperone protein that is, among other things, expressed in the male mammalian reproductive tract in association with sperm, where it may function in improving cell survival (Law and Griswold, 1994; Ammar and Closset, 2008). Similarly, galectin-3 was found in seminal fluid of various mammals and is also expressed in the female mammalian reproductive tract (Jones et al., 2010; Nio-Kobayashi, 2017). Matrilysin (matrix metalloproteinase-7) has been shown to be expressed in the glandular epithelium of the chicken oviduct (Le\u015bniak-Walentyn and Hrabia, 2016). Maestro heat-like repeat-containing protein family members were found to be constituents of the chicken egg shell membrane (Makkar et al., 2015). Finally, zonadhesin-like protein is related to zonadhesin, a protein component of sperm that functions in mammalian sperm\u2013zona pellucida binding (Lea et al., 2001). The detection of zonadhesin-like protein in the conditioned medium of the SST cells may therefore be related to avian sperm\u2013egg interaction.",

The cultured SST cells are polarized epithelial cells with apical microvilli, and, while they do contain some lipid vacuoles, their primary feature is their apparent secretion of mucus from the numerous vesicles arrayed under their apical cell membranes. Since contamination of the SST cell lines with the mucus-secreting cells of the UVJ seems unlikely\u2014since the SST-3 cell line was carefully derived from the distal end of an SST, where no mucus-secreting UVJ cells would be present\u2014there seemingly must be another explanation for our results. One hypothesis could be that the in vivo SST epithelium evolutionarily derives from the non-ciliated, mucus-secreting epithelium of the UVJ, and, along with the evolution of the tubule structure, the cells have evolved to downregulate mucus production and instead store more lipid, presumably for the nutritional support of sperm while they are resident in the SSTs (Bakst et al., 1994). The artificial environment of in vitro culture may then have caused the resumption of the mucus-secreting phenotype for unknown reasons. Further investigations of culture environments and methods need to be tested in the hope of finding in vitro conditions that result in retention of the in vivo characteristics of the SST cells. If in vivo phenotypic fidelity can be achieved, it is likely that the SST cell lines would be a useful in vitro model for investigations of the mechanisms of in vivo SST function.",
