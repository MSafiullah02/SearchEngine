To bill, there must be proper documentation and the patient must be informed. The physician may find it awkward to return an emergent call and inform the patient they will bill for the call. Patient requested non-urgent calls could be scheduled as a visit by the office, documented, and submitted for reimbursement. Remote patient monitoring is also available and billable but is not yet scaled16.

Regulatory and billing issues were important, albeit secondary considerations. Using workflow diagrams (see Figure 1\n) to map the entire visit cycle in the practice helps to ensure a new service integrates well. By adding or changing only the parts of the workflow required to incorporate telemedicine, the new offering becomes seamlessly delivered in daily operations. We addressed one use case at a time, with plans to grow with each success facilitating adoption. Many practices may first start by looking for a mobile platform and then adapt their workflow to the technology. The authors advocate for the alternative approach of conceptualizing the desired future state first and then finding the right technology for the workflow. Some options are large platforms branded with the practice\u2019s name, while others are a simple link to join a visit. Technology is replaceable; however, a robust process to integrate that technology allows a program to thrive.",

Furthermore we found it better to use of large screens to more readily visualize the patient (tablets instead of mobile phones for conducting VVs, for example). Video visits can be converted to a telephone call if the video connection is unsuccessful. In addition, the team has found value in involving the provider when deciding if the patient can be scheduled for a VV, telephone call, or if they need to be seen emergently.

Using the same method to check visual acuity each time allows the provider to trend the measured vision, which becomes more useful data.

It is unlikely that one could obtain all the information necessary to submit an eye code. Low level E/M codes are recommended. The authors recommend to check Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Academy of Ophthalmology resources for up-to-date billing changes, as the billing requirements are in a constant state of flux. Briefly, there are three main types of reimbursable visits6\n1.Telehealth visit \u2013 VVs with supporting documentation for established patients and, under the waiver, new patient visits.2.Virtual Check-in \u2013 Telephone calls with supporting documentation. The phone encounter cannot be tied to an office visit within the last 7 days nor can it result in an in-office appointment within the next 24 hours or next available.3.Digital Encounters \u2013 a patient-initiated communication through a HIPAA compliant portal used to perform E/M services, normally done during a face-to-face communication. These services may be billed once during a 7 day cumulative period. This does not include global periods and is available for established patients.\n",

Despite the fact that the technology for remote ophthalmic monitoring is not scalable or ready, it seems that our patients are willing to adopt this approach. This crisis will likely spur innovation that will transform care delivery. For ophthalmology that could mean scalable and more accurate home testing. There may be improved near focus on smartphone cameras or attachments for self-photography. Remotely controlled slit lamp devices, non-mydriatic fundus cameras and OCT machines may become more available in public areas. Perhaps the ophthalmologist will routinely have scheduled telephone calls and VVs with patients to review test results, check on medication adherence, or triage patients.",

For glaucoma, VVs are particularly useful for medicine reconciliation and assessment of glaucoma medication tolerance. Retinal telehealth is best supported by store-and-forward asynchronous models which are already well-established in some settings29\n,\n30.
