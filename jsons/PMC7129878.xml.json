The host reservoir from which humans were infected remains to be determined. However, molecular phylogenetics can be used to assess SARS-CoV\u2019s evolutionary origin and history of change by analyzing genes from SARS-CoV with homologous genes from other coronaviruses. Though surveys and sampling of coronaviruses from both wild and domestic host-species are limiting, comparative phylogenetic analyses for viruses and hosts is important in elucidating the history of host associations as well.",

To date, group 3 coronaviruses have been found only in birds, group 1 coronaviruses have been found in carnivores, cetartiodactyls and primates, and group 2 coronaviruses have been found in cetartiodactyls, perissodactyls, rodents, and birds. Previous phylogenetic analyses, all of which were unrooted, suggested that SARS-CoV represents a relatively early diverging coronavirus lineage equally distantly related to the three groups of coronaviruses noted above. On this basis, SARS-CoV was proposed as representing a fourth, distinct group within the genus Coronavirus (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). These previous studies, which focused on characterizing and sequencing SARS-CoV, did not yield evidence for recombination within the SARS-CoV genome, although Marra et al. (2003) commented that the s2m motif within the SARS-CoV UTR may be the product of horizontal transfer, given the disjunct presence of s2m in many if not all astroviruses, a picornavirus (ERBV) and only one group 3 coronavirus (avian infectious bronchitis viruses (IBV)).",

This approach is analogous to bootscanning (e.g. Salminen et al., 1995), however, we use Bayesian inference rather than neighbor joining (NJ) and amino acid sequences rather than nucleotides. For BI, four chains were run for 200 K generations with a 100 K generation burn-in using a \u03b3 distribution of rates and the transition matrices WAG for S and N, and rtREV for RDRP (Dimmic et al., 2002) in MrBayes v.3b4 (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001) and summarized as a 50% majority rule consensus tree. We used the differential phylogenetic position of different SARS-CoV gene fragments (\u2018windows\u2019) with respect to other coronavirus groups to identify potential recombination breakpoints and to divide the alignment into segments for additional phylogenetic analyses (Fig. 2A for RDRP) with BI and NJ bootstrap. For the analysis of these segments, BI parameters were as above, except each chain was run for 1 million generations. For NJ bootstrap, we used 1000 bootstrap replicates and NJ searches under default parameters in PAUP*, summarized as a 50% majority rule consensus tree. We used the approximately unbiased (AU) test (Shimodaira, 2002) to assess the validity of these breakpoints by determining whether alternative phylogenetic placements for different SARS-CoV gene regions can be statistically rejected using the program CONSEL (Shimodaira and Hasegawa, 2001) with branch lengths and model parameters estimated in PAML (Yang, 1997).",

We used TreeFitter v.1 (Ronquist, 2000) which incorporates differential costs to the four types of potential events of a host\u2013parasite association: codivergence (C), duplication (D), sorting (S) and host switching (H). We used various event costs to test a variety of situations (see Desdevises et al., 2002, Ronquist and Liljeblad, 2001). Significance of fit was determined by comparing the cost of the observed tree with 10,000 random permutations of the coronavirus tree terminals.",

These unrooted topologies (not shown) are compatible with the rooted topologies, indicating that the results for SARS-CoV in Fig. 1 are not due to long branch attraction involving the outgroup. We then used the approximately unbiased (AU) tree selection test (Shimodaira, 2002) to see if the alternative, competing trees for each gene fragment can be statistically rejected in favor of the optimal tree, or if the conflicting results between the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 regions are not statistically significant.

As further evidence of this, when the program settings are changed to maximize codivergence events (H=0; or H=0 and C=\u22121) the global fit between the two trees is no longer significant (P\u2aa20.05).

We say \u2018ancient\u2019 to denote that both regions are sister to clades of other sequences, rather than to any single recently diverged sequence. These results indicate that the two SARS-CoV RDRP regions do indeed represent two unique histories. Thus, it is preferable not to analyze them together, as has been done in previous analyses (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003) because their history cannot be represented by a single tree. These previous analyses used distance methods (NJ) less able to accommodate heterogeneity in rates of sequence character change, and found RDRP as a whole to be closest to group 2 coronaviruses. This may result from conflicts within the data stemming from recombination and/or from effects of rate heterogeneity. The authors do not report whether alternative trees could be rejected based on their analyses of multiple genes, though it seems unlikely, as when we performed similar analyses for the S and N proteins we were not able to differentiate between alternative SARS-CoV sister relationships using the AU test. We note that the approach for detecting recombination implemented here is rigorous in comparison to traditional bootscanning, in that it analyzes more conserved amino acids using Bayesian inference rather than NJ, and explicitly tests the significance of alternative topologies using the AU test. It is possible and likely that more recombination events have happened within RDRP, N, S or other SARS-CoV genes, than we have detected here, although the evidence for recombination generally becomes more difficult to discern over time.",

They may have even been incorporated concomitantly, perhaps on transmission from an ancestor of IBV, the only coronavirus with s2m (Jonassen et al., 1998). As the 5\u2032 region of RDRP and the s2m motif are disjunct in the SARS-CoV genome, putative replication-dependent recombination would have involved several consecutive template switches, as was inferred for the transfer of s2m to IBV (Jonassen et al., 1998). Alternatively, horizontal transfer from astroviruses or a picornavirus cannot be ruled out, as horizontal transfer of s2m accounts for its presence in three different virus families (Jonassen et al., 1998).",

Coronavirus genomes generally appear resilient and able to tolerate deletions, insertions and rearrangements (de Haan et al., 2002). Similar to our findings, Decimo et al. (1993) suggested that N genes from murine hepatitis viruses were the result of double recombination, and several authors have reported evidence for recombination among natural isolates of IBV (e.g. Jia et al., 1995, Wang et al., 1993). Recombination can be important in gain of novel functions. For example, in HIV recombination is considered to be a powerful adaptive mechanism for antiviral agent resistance and cytotoxic T-cell escape (e.g. Morris et al., 1999). The combination of horizontal transfer and recombination results in complex phylogenies that may blur the evolutionary history of genes (e.g. Keeling and Palmer, 2001, Rest and Mindell, 2003), especially since horizontal transfer and recombination are often associated processes.",

However, based on current sampling and analyses summarized in Fig. 3, some host switching events are implicated in accounting for incongruence between the host and coronavirus phylogenies. For example, chicken and turkey are sister taxa within the host phylogeny, yet isolates from each do not form host-specific monophyletic groups. Rather, some isolates from chicken are most closely related to turkey isolates, suggesting host-shifts for coronaviruses between these two bird species (Fig. 3). A third avian species, the manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus) is the host to a group 2 coronavirus (Kirkwood et al., 1995), which are otherwise known only from mammals. The phylogenetically nested position of this avian coronavirus within mammalian-host isolates suggests a possible bird\u2013mammal host-shift. Coronavirus host-shifts between mouse and rat are implicated in the same manner as for chicken and turkey; isolates from the two rodent species are not reciprocally monophyletic. Similarly, isolates from pig are not monophyletic, including two group 1 and one group 2 coronavirus in Fig. 3. With the outbreak of SARS, coronavirus isolates from humans are also non-monophyletic.",

Inclusion of additional host and virus sampling in Fig. 3, including two isolates from dogs, implicates potential host-shift between dogs and pigs, rather than cats and pigs. This demonstrates sensitivity to sampling, although the implication of host-shifting as a phenomenon remains. The emerging picture of coronavirus host associations is increasingly indicative of host-shifts. This is supported in Fig. 3 by the observations mentioned above as well as (1) the sister relationship between human coronavirus 229E and porcine (pig) epidemic diarrhea virus and (2) non-monophyly for human coronavirus 229E and SARS-CoV. Further, according to statistical tests in TreeFitter, allowing host-shifts to occur results in significant fit while duplication, codivergence and sorting play no detectable role. Depending on the assigned costs, TreeFitter estimates between 9 and 15 host-shifts in reconciling the host and coronavirus phylogenies shown in Fig. 3, though the actual number is unknown. In light of the genomic disparity among diverse coronaviruses from some individual host-species (e.g. humans, pigs), it seems unlikely that increased sampling of coronaviruses will yield monophyly for all isolates from each of the individual host-species in Fig. 3.",

Demonstration of recombination in the SARS associated coronavirus lineage indicates its potential for rapid unpredictable change, a potentially important challenge for public health management and for drug and vaccine development. The known non-human coronaviruses come from only nine, mostly domestic, mammal or bird species, and searches for the zoonotic reservoir might reasonably focus on other species, including non-domesticated animals, that are used as food for humans in the geographic region of the SARS outbreak.",

The sister relationship of SARS-CoV RDRP with other coronavirus groups (1, 2 and/or 3) for each fragment is indicated by color code and numbers. BI phylogenies are shown for the entire 5\u2032 (B) and 3\u2032 (C) regions of RDRP. Numbers by each node are posterior probabilities, and when applicable, are followed by neighbor joining bootstrap percentages in italics.
