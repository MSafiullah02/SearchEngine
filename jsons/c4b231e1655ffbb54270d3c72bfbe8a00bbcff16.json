Habitat features and dominant benthic groups were noted for each site. For each species encountered, a sample portion of the colony was taken; more colonies \\\\ere sampled when unusual forms or undescribed species were encountered. hlost specimens were photographed in situ before collection. A tentative identification, colour of the colon)-, and depth at which it occurred, were recorded, along with other relevant features such as unusual size or colony shape. A numbered plastic label was attached to each specimen as it was collected. After the dive, specimens were bleached in household bleach (sodium hypochlorite), rinsed in fresh watrr, and dried. Specimens were returned to the Museum of Tropical Queensland in Australia, where they were re-examined, identified, registered into the specimenbased database (using an RBASE system) labelled and stored in the Museum's permanent collection.",

Umbgrove (1940) noted that these islands are protected from prevailing winds and occupy a position between two major monsoonal influences; he did not, however, record any unusual species, probably because his investigation was limited to shallow water. Our studies of only 13 sites within these islands (see Appendix) revealed a composite fauna comprising endemic species, rare species (such as A. caroliniana and A. multiacuta), and the species mentioned above with disjunct distributions. Most unusually, all of these species occur abundantly, making this the most unusual Acropora fauna we have ever seen. A 'Tethyan-relictual' origin was proposed to explain the unusual coral assemblages of these islands (Wallace, 1997b) . The hypothesis is that contained within the fauna of the islands is a relictual element of the earler coral fauna of the Tethys Sea, which was gradually closed by movement and docking of terranes from its borders during the Miocene period. The three major patterns of distribution of drropora species discussed above are identified by \\$'allace (1 997b) as: 'duality', 'endemicity' and 'Tethyan-relictual', and it is concluded that the Acropora species composition of Indonesia is a composite with origins in a number of events in space and time.",

The multiple axial corallites feature of the Isopora subgenus is the least developed in this species, its colonies mostly appearing to have cylindrical branches: however, it is included in the subgenus because some branches bear more than one axial cordite and because of its similarity in all other characters to the other species in the subgenus. manuscript is gratefully acknowledged. The paper benefited greatly from the field photography of Michael Aw and Robin Aiello. The colleagues who sent us specimens from Indonesian localities are listed in 'Methods' (see p. 202); we greatly appreciate the trouble they went to in order to enhance the value of this revision.
