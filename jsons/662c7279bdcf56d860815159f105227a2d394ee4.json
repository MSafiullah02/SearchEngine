Third, once the condition of patient changes, it can be quickly examined by ultrasound to further determine whether there is pneumothorax or increasing of pleural effusion. Bedside puncture can be performed by the direction of the lung ultrasound. It also can be clear if there is an increase of lung edema, combined with the parameters of oxygenation, which can direct whether mechanical ventilation and other treatments are needed. Forth, with the evaluation of the condition of the lung, combining parameters of oxygenation, hemodynamics and ventilator determine the timing of the implementation of the Extractorporeal membrane oxygenation.Fifth, for the critically ill patients who have been treated with mechanical ventilation or ECMO, we can dynamically evaluate the condition of the lungs, further clarifying the prognosis.",
