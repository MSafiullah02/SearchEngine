The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV2 (also referred to as COVID-19) coronavirus pandemic highlights the importance of understanding shared disease pathophysiology potentially informing therapeutic choices in individuals with Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Two coronavirus receptor proteins, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP4) are also established transducers of metabolic signals and pathways regulating inflammation, renal and cardiovascular physiology, and glucose homeostasis. Moreover, glucose-lowering agents such as the DPP4 inhibitors, widely used in subjects with T2D, are known to modify the biological activities of multiple immunomodulatory substrates. Here we review the basic and clinical science spanning the intersections of diabetes, coronavirus infections, ACE2, and DPP4 biology, highlighting clinical relevance and evolving areas of uncertainty underlying the pathophysiology and treatment of T2D in the context of coronavirus infection",

Analysis of 124 consecutive ICU admissions in a single center in Lille France from February 27-April 5 2020 revealed greater rates of obesity and severe obesity among SARS-CoV-2 patients, relative to historical non-SARS-CoV-2 controls (21). The frequency of obesity was 47.5% in this observational study, compared to 25.8% in a historical control group of ICU subjects with non-SARS-CoV-2 illness, and the requirement for intubation and mechanical ventilation was higher in subjects with obesity. Related observations were reported in a retrospective analysis of 3,615 SARS-CoV-2+ subjected presenting to the emergency room at a single medical center in New York from March 4-April 4 2020. Individuals with obesity or severe obesity <60 years old were more likely to require acute medical care and admission to the intensive care unit (22) . Consistent with these findings, a great proportion of 3,883 critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to ICUs from March 1-April 5 2020 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were reported to have a BMI >30, relative to critically ill historical controls hospitalized in the ICU from 2017-2019 with viral pneumonia (23).

Moreover, infection, severe illness, and medications such as glucocorticoids impair insulin sensitivity and often necessitates adjustment of glucose-lowering medications and insulin dosage in the hospital. Worldwide, infectious diseases contribute to excess mortality in individuals with diabetes (25) . Mortality was increased in older patients with diabetes in a retrospective analysis of people in French intensive care units hospitalized with pulmonary and invasive pneumococcal infection (26) . Nevertheless, some studies show no differences, when corrected for age and co-morbidities, in plasma biomarker responses or hospitalization outcomes in people with diabetes hospitalized in the intensive care unit with sepsis (27) . The diagnosis of diabetes has been linked to increased susceptibility to and adverse outcomes associated with bacterial, mycotic, parasitic and viral infections (28), attributed to a combination of dysregulated innate immunity and maladaptive inflammatory responses (3) . Pulmonary and systemic coronavirus infection, including SARS-CoV-2 may be complicated by secondary bacterial infection, M a n u s c r i p t 7 reflecting compromise of epithelial barrier function in the lungs and in the gastrointestinal tract.

Moreover, a healthy gut is essential for the absorption and action of several glucose-lowering medications, including widely used metformin (31), delivered orally for the treatment of T2D. Of potential clinical relevance, DPP4, ACE2 and TMPRRSS2 are substantially expressed beyond the lung within epithelial tissues including small and large bowel enterocytes (2, 32, 33) . Experimental inoculation of MERS-CoV into the murine gut of human DPP4+ transgenic mice produces a lethal infection, associated with progressive systemic viral dissemination (34). Initial reports describing clinical symptoms in 1,099 hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients in China reported a low rate (<5%) of gastrointestinal complaints. Consistent with the potential importance of enterocyte viral entry, symptoms of gut inflammation, including nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, are reported in some severely ill individuals with MERS (8) . Notably, subjects with SARS-Cov-2 may present with gastrointestinal distress without symptoms of pulmonary infection (33). A subset of these individuals also exhibit clinical evidence of liver injury, and glucose levels were higher in more severely ill patients (35). Whether oral absorption of medications for T2D, or the actions of some of these drugs on the liver, might be impaired in a proportion of infected subjects with T2D and gastrointestinal dysfunction has not been determined.",

Notably, liraglutide had no effect on glucose control or insulin levels in this model, consistent with the possibility that direct augmentation of pulmonary GLP-1R signaling, rather than indirect GLP-1 actions on islet hormones, contributes to the restoration of the pulmonary renin-angiotensin system. Similarly, administration of the DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin once daily, or liraglutide twice daily for 4 weeks, attenuated cardiac fibrosis and prevented the Ang II-mediated reduction in cardiac ACE2 activity in rats with AngII-induced hypertension (59). However, the putative pathophysiological significance of these findings in the context of experimental coronavirus infection has not been explored.",

TMPRSS2 cleaves and activates some influenza A and influenza B virus hemagglutinin envelope glycoproteins, thereby enabling viral membrane infusion and infectivity in human airway cells and type 2 pneumocytes (60). TMPRSS2 also cleaves and activates the spike protein of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, enabling virus-membrane fusion. Indeed, genetic M a n u s c r i p t 9 inactivation of TMPRSS2 in mice attenuates the extent of lung damage and inflammation induced by experimental infection with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV (61) . The importance of TMPRSS2 for viral pathogenicity is also revealed through studies employing TMPRSS2 inhibitors, such as camostat mesylate, which attenuates SARS-CoV-2 infection of human lung cells cultured ex vivo (62) . Camostat mesylate has been improved in Japan for the treatment of pancreatitis and short term use for 28 days reduced urinary protein excretion, evident by 7 days, in 3 subjects with nephrotic syndrome secondary to diabetic kidney disease, without co-existent pancreatitis (63). There is little information informing whether the regulation of TMPRSS2 expression or activity is regulated by glucose, or dysregulated in the context of experimental or clinical diabetes.",

DPP4 also cleaves a wide range of peptide hormones, chemokines and bioactive immunomodulatory proteins ( Figure 2 ) (65) , most commonly at the position 2 alanine or proline, resulting in inactivation of peptide action, or switching of peptide receptor affinity (64) . DPP4, like ACE2, is also shed from the cell membrane, and circulates as a 727 amino acid soluble moiety (sDPP4) containing amino acid residues 39-766 that retains catalytic activity. sDPP4 exerts pro-inflammatory activity alone, or through association with factor Xa, independent of its catalytic actions by interacting with cell-associated caveolin-1 or Proteinase Activated Receptor 2 on macrophages or lymphocytes (66) . Circulating DPP4 activity and levels of sDPP4 are increased in humans with hepatitis C and miscellaneous viral infections (67) . However, sDPP4 levels were lower when measured in 14 subjects with MERS-CoV infection (68) . Similarly, circulating sDPP4 levels were also reduced in humans with primary HIV infection (69) . Within the human respiratory tract, immunoreactive DPP4 has been localized to immune and endothelial cells, pleural mesothelium, lymphatics and both type 1 and type 2 pneumocytes (70). Increased DPP4 RNA and protein expression was detected in pneumocytes from subjects with a history of smoking, or lung disease, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (70, 71) .",

Humanized (hDPP4) mice may represent useful preclinical models for assessment of anti-viral therapeutics. Studies administering two human antibodies (REGN3051 and REGN3048), demonstrate interruption of the interaction of the MERS-CoV spike protein with hDPP4, and attenuated lung pathology in mice with experimental MERS-CoV infection (83) . Surprisingly, transgenic mice over-expressing hDPP4 exhibited relative resistance to MERS-CoV infection, exemplified by less lung inflammation and reduced rates of mortality. Intriguingly, these hDPP4 transgenic with higher levels of hDPP4 expression mice also exhibited increased circulating levels of sDPP4 and administration of recombinant sDPP4 attenuated lung histopathology and reduced the titers of virus recovered from lung tissue (84) . In a small study of 14 subjects hospitalized in Korea, circulating levels of sDPP4 were lower in human subjects with MERS-CoV, relative to healthy controls (68) . Levels of sDPP4 found effective for partial suppression of viral MERS-CoV entry into cells ex vivo were much higher than circulating levels of sDPP4 in human subjects. Hence, whether sDPP4 exhibits therapeutic potential for use as a soluble decoy receptor (Figure 2 ), binding to and partially sequestering circulating MERS-CoV requires further investigation. Intriguingly, MERS-CoV strains with point mutations in the RBD of the viral spike (S) protein have been isolated from an outbreak in South Korean subjects and these strains exhibit reduced binding to human DPP4 and decreased viral entry into cells ex vivo (85) .

When used in people with T2D, DPP4 inhibitors produce ~50-95% inhibition of DPP4 activity over a 24h period (92) . Hence, some residual DPP4 enzyme activity is always present within tissues and in the circulation of subjects treated with DPP4 inhibitors. Extensive preclinical studies using highly selective DPP4 inhibitors have not demonstrated evidence of impaired T cell-dependent immune responses (93) . Despite initial concerns surrounding the potential safety of DPP4 inhibitors (64) , there have been no major safety concerns related to infections or compromised immune function after more than 13 years of clinical experience. A population-based cohort study of subjects with T2D assessed data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink, and found no increased risk of pneumonia in 22,435 subjects treated with DPP4 inhibitors, compared to 188,614 individuals treated with other non-insulin glucose lowering agents (94) . These findings are consistent with a meta-analysis of multiple DPP4 inhibitor trials encompassing 23,456 study participants with T2D treated with a DPP4 inhibitor compared to 15,300 controls in studies ranging from 18 to 104 weeks (95) . No increased risk of infection was detected in subjects treated with DPP4 inhibitors. Consistent with these findings, results of large trials examining the safety of saxagliptin, alogliptin, sitagliptin, and linagliptin in humans with T2D at risk for cardiovascular or renal disease did not reveal clinically relevant safety concerns related to infections, immune or inflammatory disorders (96-100).",

DPP4 activity also potentially modulates the levels and bioactivity of multiple immunomodulatory chemokines and cytokines ( Figure 2) (64) . However, preclinical studies of mice with genetic or chemical reduction of DPP4 activity in the setting of diet-induced inflammation did not reveal dysregulation of tissue or systemic inflammatory markers, despite complete absence or marked reduction of DPP4 activity (104) . The available evidence is insufficient to determine the impact, if any, of sustained partial reduction of DPP4 activity, as achieved clinically in subjects with T2D treated with DPP4 inhibitors, on clinical outcomes in humans with active coronavirus infection. In individuals with active SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinically significant volume depletion or systemic sepsis, a reduction in renal function may necessitate adjustment of the dose of some DPP4 inhibitors. (105) . Circulating GLP-1 levels are induced by lipopolysaccharide in animals and humans (106) , are increased in human subjects with sepsis and critical illness and correlate with illness severity and mortality (107, 108) . Multiple preclinical studies demonstrate that GLP-1R agonists attenuate pulmonary inflammation, reduce cytokine production and preserve lung function in mice and rats with experimental lung injury (109) (110) (111) .

However, there is insufficient experience with these agents to suggest they might safely replace insulin in critically ill subjects with A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 14 coronavirus infection. Hence, the extensive historical experience with the use of insulin, bolstered by increasing adoption of continuous glucose monitoring, supports the ongoing use of insulin as the agent of choice in the management of severely ill subjects with diabetes and coronavirus infections. There is insufficient experience with diabetes and pregnancy in subjects with SARS-CoV-2 to make tailored therapeutic recommendations, however modified screening guidelines for gestational diabetes have been proposed in the context of SARS-CoV-2 for individuals with limited access to regular clinics (127). The expression of ACE2 within the exocrine and endocrine pancreas highlights the need for vigilance in consideration of whether pancreatic inflammation reported in some individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection may contribute to the exacerbation or development of diabetes in a subset of acutely ill patients. In hospitalized individuals with deteriorating renal function, the use of SGLT2 inhibitors and exenatide should be re-considered or discontinued, and metformin and sulfonylurea dosing may also need to be reduced or stopped.",

Both molecular isoforms of ACE2 are capable of binding a subset of coronavirus spike proteins, including the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. TMPRSS2, the membrane-anchored protease important for activation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and one of its inhibitors, camostat mesylate, is depicted Peptidase-4 exists as a membrane anchored and smaller circulating smaller form (left panel), with both molecules retaining enzymatic activity.
