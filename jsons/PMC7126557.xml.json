People in the western world can spend up to 90% of their lives indoors [1], [2]. Leaky roofs, problems with the HVAC systems, construction of overly tight buildings, the use of synthetic building materials, and chemical based personal care products are primary causes for a variety of health related problems. The exposure to air pollutants (CO2, VOCs, CO, radon, mold, atmospheric particulate matter, and microbial contaminants) may lead to immediate or long-term effects health issues. Immediate symptoms may be as mild as headaches, dizziness, fatigue, and irritation of the sinuses [3]. People most susceptible to these air pollutants include the young, the elderly, and the chronically ill [3]. These effects may also be amplified for people suffering from asthma, which affects approximately 26 million people in the US [4], resulting in 2 million hospital visits in 2010 [3], and costing Americans approximately $56 billion from 2002 to 2007 [4]. Long-term exposure may lead to respiratory disease, heart disease, cancer, and can even be fatal [3]. Due to these factors, improving or maintaining indoor air quality (IAQ) is essential during the design process, construction, and the operating lifetime of buildings.",

Examples of extreme events include chemical and biological warfare (CBW) attacks as well as the transmission of infectious diseases (TID). Particular examples of CBW attacks are the Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway system in 1995 [5], and the anthrax attacks in Florida, New York City, and Washington D.C. in 2001 [6]. The agents used during these attaches were highly lethal, and a rapid detection may have mitigated their impact. The TID are of concern in highly populated and confined areas such as close office quarters, train/subway stations, train/subway cars, airports, aircraft, hospitals, and schools. Documented cases of the spread of influenza [7] and the SARS virus [8] have been reported in aircraft travel, outbreak of measles in office spaces [9], and tuberculosis infection of health care workers [10]. A recent outbreak is the MERS-CoV outbreak in health care facilities in South Korea and China [11]. As in the case of the CBW agents, rapid detection may have helped isolate the spread of the infections before a large number of people were exposed to these diseases.",

The common link between these steps are the design, deployment, data collection, and data analysis of sensors in the building. The risk assessment stage relies on predictive modeling (zonal airflow network modeling, CFD and contaminant transport simulations, design of sensor locations, and construction of sensor estimators) to provide a priori design information for effective systems. The identification stage depends on sensors to provide critical information about contaminant levels and sources locations (using the sensor estimations for real-time estimation and control). The response strategies help control, isolate, or remove the detected contaminants (using sensor estimators for source identification, determine where to disperse neutralizing agents, and using real-time data to develop an evacuation strategy). In the application of IAQ the response strategies are HVAC controls for demand response of HVAC systems, which have been shown to be a viable energy saving control strategy and to increase IAQ [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. For CBW/TID applications, the response strategies can include evacuation plans, a plan for dispersion of a neutralizing agent, or an isolation plan to prevent further spread of the CBW agent/TID pathogen.",

The number of sensors in this scenario may be very large, which for fairly expensive sensors may not be feasible.

An objective/cost/fitness function is created based on the goals of the deployed sensors. This cost function is maximized using an optimization algorithm. Optimization methods typically result in understanding some notion of the sensor locations, coverage volume, and response time for a given set of release scenarios. There has been some investigation as to which air flow model is most appropriate (CFD, zonal, or multizone) for optimization problems [31], [32]. During this investigation multizone air flow models seem to perform just as well as CFD airflow models, and may be easier to setup and solve.

Other examples include optimal sensor location for aircraft cabins starting from a set of initial sensor locations and a set of release scenarios [26]. General recommendations for sensor locations for an aircraft cabin have been given in Ref. [27]. The applicability of inverse methods for advection-diffusion problems have been recently reviewed [28]. The adjoint probability inverse modeling method has been shown to work well in a multizone airflow model where the number of potential sensor locations is relatively small [29]. However, when the number of potential locations for a sensor is fairly large, the method (especially when involving CFD for the forward problem) may become computationally prohibitive. The use of some heuristics is usually needed to alleviate some of the computational complexity. Inverse methods [23] along with artificial neural networks [33] have been used to quickly find the source location in a building through both CFD and multizone methods.",

Such a formulation also allows novel developments in control theory to be applied for identifying sensor locations for multizone and CFD airflow simulations. Furthermore, such a formulation can leverage the impressive body of work on sensor placement, which is a classical problem in dynamical systems and state space systems. For instance, the continuous form of the Perron-Frobenius (PF) operator has been effectively used to determine where density (of, say, contaminants) gathers under the effect of non-linear vector fields [34]. More recently, the discrete finite dimensional form of the PF operator, which takes the form of a Markov Matrix, has been used to identify optimal sensing locations [35], [36]. Utilizing the finite dimensional PF operator has been shown to be a simple way to calculating real-time contaminant transport in buildings [37]. Additionally, such analysis also provides insight into the age of the air and where contaminants spend the most time [38]. The critical advantage of this method is that the finite dimensional PF operator method is relatively computationally inexpensive, as they do not require solving the (direct or adjoint) advection-diffusion PDE or minimization of a complicated cost function.",

The main idea is determining sensor locations from velocity vector fields (acquired from analytical methods, CFD, particle imaging velocimetry, etc.). We leverage the finite dimensional PF operator framework and showcase a sensor placement algorithm that is very easy to solve. This algorithm naturally accounts for complex geometries, constraints in sensor placement, as well as sensing constraints. We illustrate the capabilities of this framework by comparing results with established recommendations from published literature. The sensor placement strategy for a given building zone is investigated for both IAQ and CBW applications. This approach is a data driven method that maximizes the sensing volume by taking into account the number of sensors and the response time for a given accuracy of the sensors. The method described in this paper has the potential to provide designers, engineers, and architects with not only the sensor locations and sensor coverage for deployed wireless sensors, but also the framework for classical estimator problems and real time contaminant transport.",

Location constraints exist because some practical limitations exist that preclude placing a sensor in a given state. Some practical limitations include the following: the sensor location is not serviceable; occupants have the ability to move or bump into the sensor, damage the sensor, or be annoyed by the location of the sensor; and sensor design limits the placement to a wall or ceiling. Location constraints exist for IAQ, CBW, and TID applications. Often expensive CBW and TID sensors would have to be placed outside the occupied zone, such that the sensors are not tampered with or easily damaged. Occupants may not want CO2 and VOC sensors in the occupied space such that they have to walk around them, avoid stepping on them, or for ascetic reasons. The placement of sensors at the top of a tall atrium may not be a good location, because if a sensor malfunctions the sensor may not be easily replaced or serviced.

Another situation where the response time is the same is when there are multiple sensor locations that can cover the state that are not yet observable (ex: placement of 3 sensors and 2 obstructions). Coverage maps are mostly similar, which is to be expected since the regions of low air speed do not change by simply adding placement or sensing constraints.

For this reason, a sensing constraint is added to the contaminant tracking matrix such that only the occupied zone is sensed. Just like the CBW and TID applications, sensors also should not be placed where occupants can damage or move the sensors. For this reason, a location constraint is also added in this situation to constrain the sensors to locations outside the occupied space. Because the sensing volume is smaller, the response times are faster than the other two applications, Fig. 12. For this application sensors tend to be placed near the occupied zone or at the outlet. Also in this situation for the case 3 algorithm, the entire occupied space may become observable before the desired number of sensors is reached. In the examples of 4 sensors for both the isothermal and 2 obstruction cases, 3 sensors are required to sense the entire occupied space and a placement of a 4th sensor provides only redundant information. This is due to the telescoping nature of the placement algorithm. When considering the union of the column supports for multiple sensor locations, this situation may not occur.",

We illustrated this methodology for three different steady state flow fields under different sensor placement constraints and sensing constraints that are relevant to CBW and IAQ applications. While the methodology is general, we choose to illustrate the approach using steady state flow fields for simplicity. In reality, flow fields experience perturbations by occupants moving around the space, changes in air flow conditions (boundary conditions), and are usually transient. The flow fields produced by these perturbations and the changes in supply air temperature, supply air flow rate, and changes in the building envelope surface temperatures or thermal loads are transient in nature. The elegance of considering the flow field (and the associated contaminant transport dynamics) from a dynamical systems perspective allows leveraging rigorous mathematical tools for sensor placement. More importantly, this methodology can be naturally extended to transient flow fields (as formulated in Eq. (17) and also to uncertain (stochastic) flow fields [48]. This is the basis of two forthcoming papers that 1) investigate sensor locations for transient flow fields or multiple operating conditions, and 2) incorporate uncertainty in boundary conditions and the flow field to determine robust sensor locations.",

The contributions of this paper has the ability to help designers, engineers, and researches better understand the coverage maps, response times, and number of sensors needed to effectively control the mechanical systems in buildings and design response and evacuation strategies during extreme events.
