In such experiments, all cells in a culture are infected simultaneously, i.e., at high multiplicity of infection. Unadsorbed input virus is removed or neutralized, usually after 1 hour, and the increase in infectious virions over time is followed by titrating cell-free and cell-associated infectivity. Shortly after infection, the inoculated virus \u201cdisappears\u201d; infectious particles cannot be demonstrated, even intracellularly. This eclipse period (Fig. 4-1\n) continues until the first progeny virions become detectable some hours later. Nonenveloped viruses mature within the cell and are detectable for some hours as intracellular virions before they are released by cell lysis. Many enveloped viruses, on the other hand, mature by budding from the plasma membrane and are thus immediately released into the medium. The eclipse period ranges from 5 to 15 hours for the various DNA viruses and from 3 to 10 hours for RNA viruses (see Table 4-2\n).",

Certain early viral genes are transcribed into RNA which may then be processed in a number of ways, including splicing. The early gene-products translated from this messenger RNA (mRNA) are of two main types: proteins that regulate the expression of the viral and cellular genomes, and enzymes required for the replication of viral nucleic acid (Table 4-1\n). Following viral nucleic acid replication, late viral genes are transcribed. The late proteins are principally viral structural proteins; some of these are subject to posttranslational modification, such as glycosylation and/or cleavage. Assembly of icosahedral virions occurs in the nucleus or cytoplasm, depending on the particular family. Enveloped viruses are completed by \u201cbudding\u201d through cellular membranes.

Orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses bind via the hemagglutinin, an envelope glycoprotein, to glycoprotein or glycolipid cellular receptors with oligosaccharide side chains terminating in N-acetyl-neuraminic acid. Most enteroviruses of humans, swine, and chickens are highly host cell-specific, because only the homologous cells carry receptors to which the relevant viral capsid protein attachment site can bind.",

Viruses may use receptor-mediated endocytosis to initiate infection (Plate 4-1\n). Following attachment to receptors, virions move down into coated pits. These pits, coated with clathrin, fold inward to produce coated vesicles that enter the cytoplasm and fuse with a lysosome to form a phagolysosome. With enveloped viruses, the envelope of endocytosed virions fuses with the lysosomal membrane, releasing the viral nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm. In this way a virion can be uncoated by a lysosome but escape total degradation by the lysosome's hydrolytic enzymes. Recent studies with influenza virus have identified a pH 5-mediated conformational change in the hemagglutinin molecule which enables fusion to occur between the viral envelope and the membrane of the phagolysosome.",

With viruses that enter the cell by fusion of their envelope with either the plasma membrane or the membrane of a phagolysosome, the nucleocapsid is discharged directly into the cytoplasm. In the case of viruses with helical nucleocapsids, transcription begins from viral RNA while it is still associated with nucleoprotein. In the case of the icosahedral reoviruses only certain capsid proteins are removed and the viral genome expresses all its functions, even though it is never fully released from the core (\u201csubviral particle\u201d; Plate 4-2\n). Poxviruses are uncoated in two stages: first, to a core, from which half the genome is transcribed; then completely, following the synthesis of a virus-coded uncoating protein. With the picornaviruses, the process of attachment of the virion to the cell leads to a conformational change in the capsid, resulting in the loss of capsid proteins VP4 and VP2 and rendering the particle susceptible to proteases; the attachment step itself triggers the process of uncoating. For some viruses that replicate in the nucleus there is evidence that the later stages of uncoating occur there, rather than in the cytoplasm.",

To synthesize viral proteins, viral mRNAs must be produced in a form capable of being recognized and translated on cellular ribosomes. Eukaryotic cells synthesize their own mRNA in the nucleus by transcription of the cellular DNA followed by processing of the transcript. They lack the enzymes necessary for synthesizing mRNA off a viral RNA genome and they cannot transcribe viral DNA located in the cytoplasm. Therefore, only those DNA viruses that replicate in the nucleus utilize the cellular machinery for transcription. All other viruses provide their own enzymes to produce mRNAs. Eukaryotic cells have a further constraint, namely, that the protein-synthesizing machinery apparently cannot recognize internal initiation sites within polycistronic mRNAs. Hence viruses must synthesize a separate (monocistronic) mRNA corresponding to each gene in their genome, or, alternatively, a polycistronic mRNA must be translated into a large precursor \u201cpolyprotein\u201d which is then cleaved into individual proteins.",

At different stages of the viral replication cycle\u2014\u201dpre-early,\u201d \u201cearly,\u201d \u201cintermediate,\u201d and \u201clate\u201d\u2014the various transcription units are transcribed in a given temporal sequence. A product of the early-region E1A induces the other early regions including E1B, but following viral DNA replication, there is a 50-fold increase in the rate of transcription from the major late promoter relative to early promoters such as E1B, and a decrease in E1A mRNA levels. A second control operates at the point of termination of transcription.",

First, a cap, consisting of 7-methylguanosine (m7Gppp) is added to the 5' terminus. The function of this poly(A) tail is uncertain, but it may act as a recognition signal for processing and for transport of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and it may stabilize mRNA against degradation in the cytoplasm. Third, a methyl group is added at the 6 position to about 1% of the adenylate residues throughout the RNA (methylation). Fourth, introns are removed from the primary transcript and the exons are linked together in a process known as splicing; the precise mechanism is not known but may involve excision of the introns by endonucleases, followed by ligation. Splicing is an important mechanism for regulating gene expression in nuclear DNA viruses. A given RNA transcript can have two or more splicing sites and be spliced in several different ways to produce a variety of mRNA species coding for distinct proteins; both the preferred poly(A) site and the splicing pattern may change in a regulated fashion as infection proceeds. The rate of degradation of mRNA provides another level of regulation. Not only do different mRNA species have different half-lives, but the half-life of a given mRNA species may change as the replication cycle progresses.",

Completion of the virion often involves proteolytic cleavage of one or more species of capsid protein. The best-studied examples among animal viruses are the picornaviruses (Fig. 4-9\n). The capsomer precursor protein (noncapsid viral protein, NCVP1a) aggregates to form pentamers; each of the 5 NCVP1a molecules is then cleaved by virus-specific proteases into VP0, VP1, and VP3. Twelve such pentamers aggregate to form a procapsid. A final proteolytic event, which cleaves the VP0 molecule into VP2 and VP4, is required for RNA incorporation. The mature virion is a dodecahedron with 60 capsomers, each of which is made up of one molecule each of VP1, 2, 3, and 4. There are also one or two uncleaved molecules of VP0 in the virion. X-Ray crystallography shows that the assembling units are not just rigid preformed \u201cbricks\u201d; they have extensions that reach across adjacent units to form second- and third-nearest neighbor relationships. Such studies have also shown that there is no fixed way in which RNA interacts with ordered parts of the protein.",

The hydrophobicity of the signal sequence facilitates binding of the growing polypeptide chain to a receptor site on the cytoplasmic side of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and its passage through the lipid bilayer to the luminal side. A signal peptidase then removes the signal sequence. Oligosaccharides are added to asparagine residues of the nascent polypeptide in the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum by en bloc transfer of a mannose-rich core of preformed oligosaccharides from a lipid-linked intermediate, an oligosaccharide pyrophosphoryldolichol. Glucose residues are then removed by glycosidases, a process known as \u201ctrimming\u201d of the core. The viral glycoprotein is then transported from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex, probably within a coated vesicle. Here the core carbohydrate is further modified by the removal of several mannose residues and the addition of further N-acetylglucosamine, galactose, and the terminal sugars, sialic acid and fucose. The completed side chains are a mixture of simple (\u201chigh-mannose\u201d) and complex oligosaccharides. While in the Golgi complex the glycoprotein may become acylated, by the covalent attachment of fatty acids such as methyl palmitate to the hydrophobic membrane attachment end of the molecule.

Most enveloped viruses, on the other hand, are released by budding, a process which can occur over a prolonged period without much damage to the cell, hence many such viruses (e.g., arenaviruses, retroviruses) are noncytopathogenic and are associated with persistent infections.
