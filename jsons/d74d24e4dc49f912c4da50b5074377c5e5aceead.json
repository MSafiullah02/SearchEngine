This has not been the case during this current pandemic, we have largely been bystanders, playing a supporting role. COVID-19 has forced the focus to be on emergency and intensive care, with surgeons being essentially furloughed, re-deployed or limited to emergency care provision.",

Support services vary -many use predominantly non-interventional investigations whilst others require more invasive modalities such as angiography and endoscopy. Some specialties practice predominantly open surgery whilst others are more suited to laparoscopic, radiological or robotic approaches. Surgical leaders nationally and locally will need to embrace these challenges, work closely with healthcare managers and give clear guidance, whilst still allowing for a degree of flexibility. This is a pandemic and countries, regions (and hospitals) will continue to differ in their response. Re-establishing elective activity will correctly focus on cancer patients already on delayed pathways. There are many other patients without cancer who also require urgent or life-saving operations and these must also be factored in. The pandemic has driven much of the public to alter their healthcare seeking behaviour and many will potentially seek alternative access or present with more advanced diseases. Most countries have seen reduced emergency patient activity during the pandemic and a rebound surge in demand is likely as work, travel and sport resume. It may therefore be prudent to retain some additional short-term emergency care capacity alongside re-establishing the elective service",

Most will have had their training 'on hold' and struggled with poorly defined roles during this crisis. Procedures providing opportunities to learn and develop have either disappeared, been managed conservatively or resulted in exclusion where consultant operating is the rule. Clinics and endoscopy opportunities have also essentially ceased. The resumption of some elective activity does not assume a return to normality and for some surgeons, a period of extended training seems inevitable.",
