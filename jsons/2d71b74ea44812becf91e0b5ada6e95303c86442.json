[2] Another comorbidity, MAFLD, also affects COVID-19 severity, as pointed out by Ji et al.. Since excess liver fat is seen in up to a quarter of people, [3] we hypothesized that its impact on severity might be modulated by age. We considered that disease severity of older patients with a greater burden of cardiac and respiratory illness would more likely be impacted by their comorbid conditions, than the presence of liver fat. In this study, we investigated the effects of MAFLD on COVID-19 severity in older versus younger patients.",

COVID-19 was diagnosed by high-throughput sequencing or RT-PCR assay of oropharyngeal swab specimens. Some of these patients were the subject of a previous report. [4] All subjects underwent screening for fatty liver by computed tomography. MAFLD was diagnosed based on the recent consensus criteria. [5, 6] Overweight was defined as body mass index (BMI) \u226523 kg/m 2 , and obesity was defined as BMI \u226525 kg/m 2 in Asians. [7] Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed based on the history or hemoglobin A1c \u22656.5%. [8] Hypertension was defined as blood pressure \u2265130/85 mmHg or specific drug treatment. The requirement for written informed consent was waived by the ethics committees of all four centers due to the emergent epidemic and the anonymized retrospective nature of the analysis.",

In patients younger than 60 years, hypertension occurred in 45 (17.3%) patients, and diabetes were noted in 29 (11.2%) patients. In patients older than 60 years, there were 32 (43.2%) cases of hypertension and 18 (24.3%) of diabetes; this was significantly higher than in younger patients (P <0.001 and P=0.004, respectively). In contrast to the findings in younger patients (age <60 years), no significant difference in C-reactive protein, prevalence of diabetes and hypertension, or blood lipids was observed between non-MAFLD and MAFLD groups in elderly patients (all P >0.05). Moreover, an association between presence of MAFLD and COVID-19 severity was only observed in younger (Chi-square test P = 0.001), but not in elderly patients (Chi-square test P = 0.66).",

[10] Thus, it might be postulated that hepatic and systemic immune responses caused by MAFLD [11] contributes to the cytokine storm in younger patients with COVID-19. In the elderly however, other comorbidities like coronary heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are more prevalent and any association with MAFLD might be masked by their impact.
