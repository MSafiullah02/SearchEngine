Control of animal-to-animal transmission of disease agents is a key concept in infectious disease epidemiology; however, a more sensible approach might be to prevent the types of contact that lead to transmission in the first place. In humans, it is often difficult to prevent contacts, particularly with the ease of long-distance travel [1]. However, in livestock and animals, movements can be the subject of legislation or strict controls and there is a real opportunity to reduce disease transmission. The importance of animal movements is, of course, well understood and international regulations [e.g. from the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE; Box 1)] exist to mitigate the risks involved [2]. In spite of these regulations, outbreaks occur regularly as a result of both legal and illegal animal movements.Box 1Useful web addressesInternational organizationsFood and Agriculture Organization: www.fao.org\nWorld Health Organization: www.who.int\nWorld Organization for Animal Health: www.oie.int\nWorld Trade Organization: www.wto.int\nAfrican Union\u2013Inter African Bureau for Animal Research: www.au-ibar.org\nOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development: www.oecd.org\nInternational regulatory bodiesCouncil of Europe: www.coe.int\nEuropean Union: europa.eu.intConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora: www.cites.org\nWorld Conservation Union: www.iucn.org\nConvention on Biological Diversity: www.biodiv.org\nInternational Air Transport Association: www.iata.org\nNational regulatory and research bodiesUnited Kingdom Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs: www.defra.gov.uk\nUnited Kingdom PET Passport Scheme: www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/quarantine/index.htm\nUnited Kingdom Foresight Project: www.foresight.gov.uk\nUnited States Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service: www.aphis.usda.gov\nUnited States Centers for Disease Control: www.cdc.gov\nUniversity of Edinburgh: www.ed.ac.uk\n",

            "text": "Unregulated (illegal or informal) trade is, by its nature, difficult to quantify, although available data for some regions of the world show that unregulated trade is substantial. Although there are no official records, it has been documented that, for example, 75 000 head of cattle move from Somalia to Kenya annually, and that up to 850 000 goats move from Somalia to the Middle East (which accounts for >95% of all goat imports from the eastern Africa region) [8]. Indeed, in the case of cattle trading with Kenya, political instability resulted in a large increase in the value of unofficial trade. This coincided with a collapse in the animal health infrastructure of Somalia and a resulting lack of animal export controls. Diseases known to have been circulating in Somalia include both zoonotic and non-zoonotic infectious diseases: anthrax, babesiosis, brucellosis, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, contagious caprine pleuropneumonia, foot and mouth disease (FMD), heartwater, peste des petits ruminants, rabies, Rift Valley fever, rinderpest and trypanosomiasis, among others [9]. Unofficially traded animals are a much greater risk factor for disease spread because they are not necessarily subject to veterinary controls. It has been reported that much of the human brucellosis problem in Saudi Arabia, which has an incidence of 40 cases per 100 000 people nationally, is the result of unscreened and unregulated imports that come mainly from Africa [10]. The picture that emerges from a consideration of these various data sources is one of a highly interconnected world in which animals move locally, regionally and across large international distances.",

Both diseases are maintained in wildlife reservoir hosts: H5N1 in wild fowl and SARS in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus species) in China 15, 16. For SARS, the trade in bats is likely to have brought infected animals into contact with susceptible amplifying hosts such as the masked palm civet (Parguma larvata) at some point in the wildlife supply chain, establishing a market cycle in which susceptible people and animals could subsequently become infected 15, 16. For avian influenza, these \u2018wet markets\u2019 could also function as network hubs for potential cross-species transmission. However, the international trade in birds also poses considerable risks for long-distance transmission of H5N1, as highlighted by the detection of infected hawk eagles imported illegally from Thailand to Belgium [17]. The disease risks of the wild bird trade have been brought into sharp relief by the importation of H5N1-infected birds destined for the UK pet market [18] and, at the time of submission of this review, a temporary ban on the importation of wild birds had been implemented by the UK government.",

Also, chytridiomycosis has appeared recently in the UK, with confirmed cases in an established breeding population of North American bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana), which is an introduced species [21].

It is doubtful whether the disease risks associated with the international wildlife trade, let alone additional welfare and conservation-related problems, can ever be justified simply to supply a demand for pets or recreational hunting. The dilemma is perhaps more acute in areas where the wildlife trade is associated with food and medicines, particularly in Asia, where the trade could be an important element in rural livelihoods and food security. In addition, translocation of wildlife can be an important tool for both conservation and animal welfare.",

This represented the first major change in UK quarantine regulations since the 1901 Importation of Dogs Act. The scheme is primarily designed to prevent the importation of rabies, with secondary measures to prevent the introduction of the cestode parasite Echinococcus multilocularis, which is currently endemic in continental Europe and can be transmitted from canids to humans to cause potentially fatal alveolar echinococcosis. Eighty-one countries now qualify under the scheme but quarantine remains the only option for non-listed countries. The PETS is a model for the use of legislation to minimize risks: the risks of importing rabies under the scheme are small. However, other zoonotic diseases continue to pose a substantial risk and there are few formal checks for these under the system. Figure 1\nshows the volume of dog and cat movements into the UK following the introduction of the PETS.",

Seropositivity rates of canine leishmaniasis can be >30% [24] in the Mediterranean, with patterns of infection that reflect the distribution of the sand fly vector (Phelobotomus species) 25, 26. In Brazil, where canine visceral leishmaniasis is an important emerging disease, canine infection in endemic areas can be as high as 67% [27]. To control the disease, a mass culling of seropositive dogs has been adopted in several areas but has not been effective [28]. A feasible alternative to culling dogs is to fit collars treated with the insecticide deltamethrin; preliminary results have shown a large drop in the number of bites by sand flies and infection rates in dogs 29, 30, 31. This might be the only way to control the increasing spread of canine visceral leishmaniasis and could be recommended as a control measure for dogs leaving and re-entering the UK under PETS. Quarantine is not effective in preventing the introduction of leishmaniasis due to the long incubation period of the disease. Outbreaks of leishmaniasis have occurred in dogs in the USA as a result of Mediterranean-based military personnel who have returned home with their pets. In addition, there has been an apparent increase in the incidence of leishmaniasis in US hunting dogs [32] \u2013 although the cause remains unclear, it could be a result of either animal movements or spread of the vector. The chances of leishmaniasis becoming established in domestic dogs in the UK are small because, currently, Phelobotomus species are not known to be present in the UK. However, if climate change does affect air temperatures substantially, the sand fly vector could become established in the UK and, potentially, could maintain endemic leishmaniasis and other \u2018exotic\u2019 parasitic diseases [33], the introduction of which would probably result from the movement of domestic pets.",

While also highlighting environmental, wildlife and other factors in the short-range spread of bTB in the UK, Gilbert et al.\n[46] quantified the strong association between the proportion of inward movements from infected areas and the breakdown of herds, which highlighted the strong predictive power of cattle movements for later disease distributions. The importance of contact networks in the spread of infectious diseases of livestock in the UK has been clearly highlighted [47]; in addition, a small proportion (20%) of farm holdings contributes to the majority (80%) of movements. If one of these high-contact farms was infected with bTB, its impact on long-range spread to many other farms would be substantial.

This was caused by movement of the cattle reservoir of the trypanosome parasite through markets without proper screening or disease control.

Disease spread through this pig herd probably occurred with three waves of infection and amplification. However, FMD was not notified to the authorities until it was identified during a routine meat inspection at an abattoir in the south east of the country (several hundred miles away) on 19 February; FMD was confirmed on 20 February [50]. At the time of disease identification in the abattoir, the virus had already spread to a neighbouring farm where sheep and cattle were infected, probably by airborne spread [51]. Sheep from this farm were sold to a local market on 13 February and sold again two days later at a larger market [52]. By the time the first case was confirmed, an estimated 30\u201379 farms had been infected across the UK 52, 53. Rapid tracing identified the pig farm but a movement ban for the whole of the UK was delayed for three days (although all international movements were stopped immediately). This three-day delay might have caused a further 17 farms to become infected, mostly from contacts with markets [54]. The virus spread to France through the movement of infected sheep before the ban. In addition, calves bound for the Netherlands were in a vehicle next to these sheep at a stopping point and it is thought that the virus was transmitted between these two consignments \u2013 FMD was confirmed in the Netherlands on 21 March [55]. This outbreak clearly demonstrates the risks associated with large-scale movements of animals over long distances across international borders.

There are well-established trade routes across the continent that supply the large coastal populations of west and central Africa and the Arabian peninsula. These animal movements are of major importance for the dissemination of new strains of FMD and other diseases such as Rift Valley fever [56]. Modern DNA sequencing techniques make it possible to compare isolates and identify probable sources of infection. For example, these techniques enabled the tracing of outbreaks caused by the SAT2 FMD serotype as it spread up the east African coast into Saudi Arabia through cattle movements from Somalia and Eritrea [57] and its subsequent spread west into Cameroon [58]. In these regions, herdsmen are nomadic or semi-nomadic and move with their animals on a seasonal transhumance in search of grazing, which brings different herds into contact with one other and increases the risk of spread of FMD [59].",

Movements can result in the introduction of exotic animal diseases or human pathogens, which might themselves have important economic and/or public health impacts. One example occurred in 2003 when humans in the USA became infected with monkey pox [60], which originated from the importation of wild west African rodents. Minimizing such risks should be a high priority and, in some cases, this might involve preventing the animal trade altogether: from the perspective of disease introductions and animal welfare, it is difficult to justify the movement of exotic birds or mammals simply for the pet trade. Attempting to ban such movement, however, is likely to drive it underground, which makes risk-mitigation far more difficult. With livestock, there is a strong case for trading only in livestock products \u2013 a commodity-based approach \u2013 rather than live animals themselves [61] but this, of course, is dependent on the appropriate investment and infrastructure being available to process animal products and to provide adequate quality assurance.",

Markets serve as contact nodes between infected herds and the ease of transportation can result in the widespread dissemination of animals that have been in contact in a market. Contact nodes such as quarantine facilities, markets and ports of entry can also result in the transmission of agents between individuals and species, with rapid subsequent dissemination.

Simple risk assessments that focus on the individual country trying to protect itself from disease introductions are no longer sufficient and passive detection of disease at ports of entry is an increasingly dangerous strategy as the volume of movements increases. A holistic understanding of risk at the global level is required to understand disease risks by species and by country, supplemented by an efficient global surveillance network in which different animal species are regularly screened, particularly before moving from their source areas. Control of disease threats should be dealt with locally rather than when movement has already occurred, which requires knowledge of species, volumes moved and fine-scale information on point of origin. Knowledge of movement routes is the key to predicting the pattern of spread of infectious diseases of humans [62], and similar data could be crucial to understand animal disease risks. Databases already exist 63, 64, 65 that list pathogens, hosts and probable risks of emergence; additional layers of information on the movements of host species and their impacts on the risks of emergence should be added, and the information should be made publicly available. Such global cooperation and international level disease control will lead to better risk management and mitigation.",
