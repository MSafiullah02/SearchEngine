The combination of innate immunity and maternal immunoglobulin-G (IgG), transferred during the last trimester of pregnancy, provides some protection against the organisms causing URTI. It has been estimated that young children may have as many as 12 respiratory infections per year if he or she attends nursery, 9 infections per year if a sibling attends school, and 6 or 7 per year if the child and a sibling are not at school [1] .",

Leukocytosis is common in the absence of bacterial infection. A chest X-ray is rarely indicated, unless the diagnosis is uncertain, in patients with fever >39\u00b0C and in case of severe asthma. Measurement of oxygen saturation is always indicated when a child is admitted to hospital. For older children, measurement of the peak flow is important and should be repeatedly performed. Allergy skin tests (to detect IgE antibody in the skin to inhalants such as pollens and house dust mites) and the radioallergosorbent test (RAST, detecting IgE to various allergens in the serum) are often performed, but they do not seem to be of great diagnostic or therapeutic value. The most important principle of therapy is rapid reversal of the airway obstruction. Nebulized \u03b2-2 agonists remain the first line of treatment. Theophyllin may be added in severe asthma. Children with mild-moderate asthma who are not taking adequate fluids by mouth and all children with severe asthma should have intravenous (i.v.) fluid therapy. Corticosteroids are recommended for patients with acute severe asthma, but their effects are slow. Steroid therapy reduces symptoms and bronchial hyper-responsiveness and is currently widely used as an anti-inflammatory agent in asthma. Oxygen should be administered in all cases with hypoxia, delivered through a face mask to bring the oxygen saturation to > 92%. Inhaled steroids are used prophylactically for patients who have more frequent asthma attacks and who have not improved on beta-2 agonist alone.",

By 1940, pneumonia was relegated to third, with approximately 70 deaths per 100,000 [16] . In children, pneumonia is common, but its true incidence is not established owing to the lack of an accepted clinical definition of pneumonia. Peak incidence occurs between 6 months and 5 years. Factors that increase the risk of pneumonia include malnutrition, parental smoking, immunosuppression, low socioeconomic status, and prematurity. The lungs are not only involved in gas exchange but also in mediating host defense. This includes nonimmunological defense mechanisms (such as lysozyme secretion by macrophages) and immunological defense mechanisms (such as activation of macrophages and B and T lymphocytes). The alveolar macrophages respond to activation by exogenous pyrogens (such as endotoxin released by Gram-negative bacteria) by releasing potent inflammatory mediators, including IL-1, TNF, and IL-8. This leads to a febrile response, accumulation of neutrophils at the site of infection, and inhibition and repair of tissue injury. IL-8 is particularly important for neutrophil chemotaxis.",

Neurological symptoms, particularly convulsion, are among the most frequent extraintestinal manifestations of shigellosis occurring with or without evidence of the production of Shiga's toxin (neurotoxin). Death can occur in children with poor nutritional state. Amoebic dysentery, caused by Entameba histolytica, may cause colitis simulating shigellosis. Virulence of E. histolytica depends on the trophozoites being able to bind to colonic epithelium. The infection tends to run a more chronic course with intermittent watery or semiformed diarrhea (containing blood and mucosa) without or with a low-grade fever. Young children tend to present with acute symptoms similar to cases with Shigella infection. Liver abscess may occur a few months after the intestinal infection, causing discomfort over the liver, intermittent fever with chills and sweats, and weight loss. Findings suggestive of amoebic liver abscess include an elevated right diaphragm, hepatomegaly, and a history of colitis. The diagnosis of amoebiasis is confirmed by demonstration of E. histolytica in a stool (motile trophozoites during the diarrhea, cyst if the diarrhea is not present) or in tissues. The indirect hemagglutination (HA) test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are positive in almost all patients with amoebic liver abscess and in the majority of those with intestinal infection. E. coli cause either non-bloody diarrhoea (e.g., enterotoxigenic E. coli = ETEC, enteropathogenic E. coli = EPEC) or bloody diarrhea (e.g., Shigatoxin-producing E. coli = STEC, enteroinvasive E. coli = EIEC). Enteroaggregative E.coli (EAggEC) cause significant fluid loss and dehydration, but bloody stools are relatively infrequent.",

This has lead to an increase of the median age of patients with bacterial meningitis to 39 years. In developing world with low immunization rates, however, these types of bacterial meningitis still occur.

Once bacteria reach the CSF, they are likely to survive because humural defenses, including immunoglobulin and complement and opsonic activities, are virtually absent. Meningitis may also result from hematogenous dissemination, or rarely by direct invasion from ear or sinus infection.

IL-10 is known to suppress the macrophages, which may explain the paucity of cytokines secreted by these cells. Diagnosis is by identifying the parasite from bone marrow or splenic aspirate. Treatment is presently with Miltefosine, orally 2.5 mg kg \u22121 per day for 4 weeks. Pentavalent antimony compounds and liposomal amphotericin B are also used. Defervescence usually occurs after a median of 6 days of treatment.",

Malnutrition was an underlying cause in over 50% of the deaths. These children are particularly susceptible to measles and tuberculosis. Chronic infections, on the other hand, may lead to loss of nutrients and malnutrition. Protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM) has been divided into severe (kwashiorkor, marasmus, and intermediate cases), moderate severe (nutritional, dwarfing, or stunting and wasting), and early (clinically detectable only by anthropometric measurement). In developing countries, the severe form of malnutrition is common as a result of several factors, including severe dietary imbalance. Marasmus results from deficiency of all nutrients, whereas kwashiorkor is due primarily to protein deficiency. In developed countries, PCM may result from debilitating chronic diseases.",
