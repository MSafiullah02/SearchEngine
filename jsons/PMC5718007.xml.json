Two independent multiplex reverse transcription nested RT-PCR assays able to detect from 1 to 10 copies of viral genomes were performed [8, 9]. One nested RT-PCR was performed using specific primers for influenza viruses (Flu-A, Flu-B and Flu-C), respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV-A and RSV-B) and adenovirus (ADV). Another, nested RT-PCR was prepared with specific primers for detection of human parainfluenza viruses (PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3 and PIV-4), corona viruses (CoV-229E and CoV-OC43), human rhinoviruses (HRV), and enteroviruses (HEV). For the PCR, a single step combined RT-PCR amplification reaction, henceforth called multiplex assay 2, was performed as described previously [8, 9] (Additional file 1).",
