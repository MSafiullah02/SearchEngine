The PRIME scheme was launched to provide early and enhanced scientific\nand regulatory support to medicines that have the potential to address unmet medical\nneeds. Developers of medicines and vaccines benefitting from PRIME will be eligible\nfor accelerated assessment, reducing the time frame for the EMA to review\napplications for market authorisation. The EMA can also grant a conditional\nmarketing authorisation for vaccines where the benefits of immediate availability\noutweigh the risks of less comprehensive data than normally required. Developers\nworking on vaccines that could be used for the prevention of COVID-19 are encouraged\nto contact the EMA and discuss their research as soon as possible.12 Once a safe\nand effective vaccine has been developed, there are further hurdles, including\nlarge-scale manufacturing. Many organisations researching a vaccine do not have the\nrequired manufacturing capacity. Vaccine development is high risk, with many\ncandidates failing to reach clinical application. Further, manufacturing facilities\ntend to be tailored to specific vaccines. Scaling up these facilities when the\nfuture deployment of a vaccine is still in the uncertain early stages is not\ncommercially viable. However, CEPI can shoulder some of this risk by providing\nfunding not only to research facilities developing vaccine candidates but also to\nmanufacturing facilities in parallel. At the same time as clinical trials are taking\nplace in Oxford, production of the vaccine is being scaled up ready for larger\ntrials and possible future deployment.5 With early-stage scale-up,\nresearchers can ensure that sufficient doses will be available as soon as possible\nif the trials prove that the vaccine is safe and effective.",

Genetic analysis from a man in the USA who tested positive in January has\nshown that it is possible to be infected by both strains. Any vaccine candidate will\nhave to target features present in both strains in order to be effective. The\ngenetic differences between the two strains are small at present and unlikely to\naffect the production of proteins that act as antigens to promote an immune\nresponse. Genetic diversity does not necessarily mean the virus is changing.\nHowever, we can expect more strains to emerge. It is generally agreed that once\ninfected, individuals are unlikely to be infected again, unless the virus mutates to\novercome host immunity. It is possible that this selection process will lead to an\noutbreak of a new strain in a similar fashion to seasonal influenza. As is the case\nwith influenza, new variants can emerge that infect individuals, whether or not they\nhave been infected in the past. This will clearly have an impact on the long-term\nefficacy of vaccines currently in development.",
