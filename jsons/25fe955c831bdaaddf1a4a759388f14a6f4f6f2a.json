As a public health emergency of international concern, the COVID-19 epidemic brings about great psychological pressure to the public and may lead to various mental problems. The limited knowledge of COVID-19 and a number of related news reports may aggravate anxiety and fear of healthy people and those who originally had psychological problems. 4 In this condition, attention should be paid on potentially vulnerable patients suffering from autoimmune diseases due to immuonospression state caused by therapy and requirement of long-term elaborate management. Synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome is a rare chronic autoimmune disease characterized by osteoarticular and cutaneous manifestations. 5 Owing to the high rate of false and/or delayed diagnoses and non-ideal therapeutic effect, patients have to endure long-lasting bone and joint pain, which causes increased physical and psychological pressure as well as declining quality of life. Previous studies in in patients with rheumatic diseases revealed that psychological stress induced exacerbation of disease activity. 6, 7 Thus, mental health and quality of life of SAPHO syndrome require attention. Meanwhile, stringent containment measures during the COVID-19 epidemic also bring great challenges in chronic disease management. Accoding to a survey in inflammatory bowel disease, the scheduled follw-up of 70.4% of patients were affected by COVID-19 pandemic. 8 Thus, it is crucial to clarifying the effects of COVID-19 on patients with SAPHO syndrome.",

Different disease manifestations also had different influence on SAPHO patients' mentalities.A greater percentage of patients with nail involvement felt worried about their disease conditions than patients without (59.6% vs 31.0%, p=0.001).

Owing to restrictions on personal movement, quarantine measures, and fear for COVID-19 infection in the hospital, the majority of patients possibly did not visit the hospital for regular follow-up. Patients with aggravated or recurred diseases might fail to obtain doctors' advices and help to adjust their treatment plan in time. Consequently, they were more worried about their own disease conditions in the COVID-19 epidemic, which was demonstrated by our data. In addition, a lack of medicine caused by restrictions on movement made patients unable to take medicine regularly and cannot maintain effective treatment.

First of all, pay attention to patients' psychological and disease conditions. For patients with aggravated or relapsed disease, provide available psychological support and guidance. Psychological problems as stress and anxiety of patients with severe ostealgia or nail involvement should be noted. In addition, ensure timely follow-up visits and adequate medication supply by online consultant and medication distribution. Timely and effective treatment can help relieve patients' pain, thereby improving their psychological conditions. Additionally, psychological intervention would help reduce the incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety. 24, 25 China has now widely launched online psychological intervention services, including psychological counseling via telephone hotlines and intervention platforms. 26 Considering that the current epidemic of Covid-19 has spread worldwide, the psychological problems of the public might persist or further develop for a long period.
