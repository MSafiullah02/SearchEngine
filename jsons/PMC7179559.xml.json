Various drugs have been applied to treat patients who contract SARS. Specific new drugs [6, 7] and vaccines [8] to SARS-CoV have been widely developed. However, specific cures are yet to be produced for SARS. Thus, further experimental and clinical research is required to produce effective therapeutic agents, nucleic acid medicines show promise in this area.",

            "text": "Engineered inactivation of gene function is important for elucidating the function of particular genes, and may also be used in gene therapy, treatment of viral infection, cancer, and other diseases caused by aberrant gene expression. Gene function can be inactivated at the DNA level by nucleic acid medicines such as antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, or at the RNA level by ribozymes and siRNAs. The development of a specific molecular antiviral therapy would be a landmark advance in medical care. A major stumbling block to this has been the achievement of specificity: compounds toxic to a virus are most often also toxic to the host cell in which these obligate intracellular pathogens reside. Recently, antisense technologies, in which specificity is conferred at the level of the nucleic acid sequence, have been tested for therapeutic potential. One such approach utilizes ribozymes. Ribozymes are RNA molecules that hybridize and cleave specific target RNAs. Once the target has been cleaved, the ribozyme can dissociate from the cleaved transcript and repeat the process with another RNA molecule [9]. The major advantage of ribozymes is that they can sequence-specifically cleave multiple target mRNA molecules, whereas antisense molecules do not cleave the target molecule themselves, but rely on the RNAi machinery, and act only at an equimolar ratio [10]. In the last 15 years, ribozymes have progressed from subjects of scientific study to potential therapeutic agents for treatment of both acquired and inherited diseases [3]. We have developed chimeric DNA-RNA hammerhead ribozymes targeted against growth factors for cardiovascular and renal diseases [11, 12]. Ribozymes have been shown to successfully inhibit gene expression in cancer [13] and human immunodeficiency virus [14]. This demonstrates the promise of this technology.",

On the other hand, short interfering RNA (siRNA) (composed of double-stranded RNA which also triggers the silencing of gene expression in a sequence-specific manner) has shown potential as a strong nucleic acid medicine for severe disease. siRNA has been successfully shown to inhibit different stages of HIV-1 replication [20].

There are several classes of ribozyme, one of which is the hammerhead, found in vivo in plant viroids and virusoids and in transcripts of new satellite DNA [23, 24]. In their natural environment, these enzymes cleave intramolecularly, cutting 3\u2032 to a required sequence, usually GUC. Hammerhead ribozymes contain two functional modules: a catalytic core which cleaves the target RNA and contains several conserved bases, and flanking regions which, through nucleic acid complementarity, direct the ribozyme core to a specific target site. By exploiting the flexibility of these two modular functions, ribozymes could potentially be designed to specifically cleave almost any target RNA molecule [25]. Cleaved mRNA is rapidly degraded, allowing the ribozyme to dissociate and react with new target RNA.",

First of all, the cleavage site should be located within an important functional region of the target gene to ensure the corresponding protein's function is lost after cleavage. In addition, the flanking sequences around the cleavage site should be as conserved as possible so that the ribozyme cleavage spectrum will remain broad [26]. SARS-CoV structure is composed of RNAs encoding repricase, spike, envelope, membrane glycoprotein, and nucleocapside protein [27, 28]. Since the spike structure RNA sequence is subject to rapid mutagenesis, the target cleavage site of a ribozyme should be located in the other viral RNA sequences. If the target GUC cleavage sequence of a ribozyme is located within a stem structure of target mRNA, the mRNA function is not suppressed. This is because the secondary structure makes the site less accessible. To ensure a stem structure was not present at the target GUC cleavage site, we analyzed the secondary structure of SARS-CoV RNA [27], and selected an optimal cleavage site where both binding arms target a loop structure that exposes the RNA sequence for the ribozyme cleavage interaction.",

The ability of the ribozyme to cleave synthetic target RNA encoding a SARS-CoV RNA was then assessed in vitro, and effectiveness of the ribozyme to inhibit MVH virus multiplication evaluated in DBT cells. MHV is a single-stranded RNA virus of the family Coronaviridae and belongs to the group II coronaviruses. Clinical infection occurs when the virus is introduced into a naive colony of mice. Coronaviruses typically have narrow host ranges and are fastidious in cell culture. Mice are the only host for MHV, although other rodent species may carry serum antibodies to the virus. In cell culture, MHV forms plaques upon multiplication in DBT cells. In the present study, inhibition on the multiplication of MVH was approximately 60%, with 60% transfection efficiency of the chimeric DNA-RNA ribozyme targeting SARS-CoV into DBT cells. This indicated that the ribozyme inhibited viral activity. In addition, it was demonstrated that the chimeric ribozyme significantly inhibited expression of synthetic SARS-CoV RNA transcribed from pCR3 plasmid in 3T3 cells. These findings suggest that this ribozyme could be useful for the treatment of SARS.",

For in vivo application of the chimeric ribozyme, the optimal method of delivery should be assessed. The advantage of the application of a ribozyme targeting SARS, compared to vaccines, is the expected rapid application possible and higher effectiveness of ribozyme treatment. However, one significant problem for the use of ribozymes as gene therapeutics is the degradation of ribozyme in vivo. RNA ribozymes are rapidly degraded in both culture medium and living cells by RNase, which diminishes copy number of the ribozyme. Thus, ribozyme therapy is not suitable for chronic diseases, but is suitable for acute diseases such as SARS. For ribozymes to be applied in tissues, a high catalytic efficiency, stability, and adequate levels of the ribozyme are necessary. A number of modifications can improve stability, specificity, and efficacy of ribozymes. Ribozymes can also be successfully delivered exogenously by transfection of cells with cationic liposomes [29]. A recent study showed that the chimeric DNA-RNA hammerhead ribozyme had enhanced catalytic turnover and stability [30]. In addition, a chimeric ribozyme containing phosphorothioate linkage further improved its resistance to nucleases [31, 32].
