            "text": "Purpose of Review This investigation aims to understand the role and burden of viral co-infections for acute respiratory illnesses in children. Co-infection can be either viral-viral or viral-bacterial and with new technology there is more information on the role they play on the health of children. Recent Findings With the proliferation of multiplex PCR for rapid diagnosis of multiple viruses as well as innovations on identification of bacterial infections, research has been attempting to discover how these co-infections affect each other and the host. Studies are aiming to discern if the epidemiology of viruses seen at a population level is related to the interaction between different viruses on a host level. Studies are also attempting to discover the burden of morbidity and mortality of these viral-viral co-infections on the pediatric population. It is also becoming important to understand the interplay of certain viruses with specific bacteria and understanding the impact of viral-bacterial co-infections. Summary RSV continues to contribute to a large burden of disease for pediatric patients with acute respiratory illnesses. However, recent literature suggests that viral-viral co-infections do not add to this burden and might, in some cases, be protective of severe disease. Viral-bacterial co-infections, on the other hand, are most likely adding to the burden of morbidity in pediatric patients because of the synergistic way they can infect the nasopharyngeal space. Future research needs to focus on confirming these conclusions as it could affect hospital cohorting, role of molecular testing, and therapeutic interventions.",

In particular, pneumonia is responsible for approximately 1.4-1.8 million fatal cases in children under age five globally [2] . Beyond the mortality burden, there is significant morbidity with symptomatic viral infections estimated at more than five episodes per year in children under age three [3] . While single viral infections are relatively straightforward, there is interest in understanding the role of dual respiratory infections in pediatric patients. Dual infections could either be viral-viral or viral-bacterial as the human respiratory tract is a reservoir for many organisms.",

In an evaluation of children under 18 years old admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of pneumonia, the most common cause of infection, whether bacterial or viral, was RSV quickly followed by rhinovirus [12] . Rhinovirus is the most common cause of respiratory viral illness during all seasons except winter when RSV is predominant [13] . Rhinovirus is second only to RSV in causing bronchiolitis in hospitalized patients [14] . Unfortunately, the true burden of rhinovirus is under-reported as many studies do not include this virus in there molecular diagnostic testing as the rates of asymptomatic shedding are quite high and it is difficult to differentiate shedding from actual cause of disease [13] .",

Viral loads can be compared among patients with one or multiple infections. One study found that viral loads were consistently high regardless of co-infection status (such as RSV, influenza A, and HMPV) but others had viral load vary based on coinfection status (such as PIV1 and adenovirus) [24] . Of these viruses, influenza A is least likely to be identified in coinfected patients.

Given the high rates of RSV and rhinovirus infections, it makes sense that they are the most commonly identified viruses in co-infected patients across multiple studies [14, [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] . However, one study did conclude that the odds of rhinovirus detection were lower when RSV was present and the odds of rhinovirus were significantly higher in those patients who received RSV immunoprophylaxis [56] . This indicates that despite the high prevalence of co-infection with these viruses, there is still viral interference occurring.",

In this review, viral co-infections did not influence risks of all outcomes assessed: mean length of stay, length of supplemental oxygen, need for hospitalization, need for intensive care admission, mechanical ventilation, or death. They also looked at sub-analyses of specific viral combinations and did not see any influence on outcomes. Lim et al. [68] did a systemic review for children under age 5 years with respiratory illness and found insufficient evidence to suggest a difference in any clinical outcome based on co-infected status. In a very small subset of patients, they found a suggestion that children without co-morbidities actually did worse when only a single virus was identified. Goka et al.

During viral infections, there are cascades of proinflammatory responses leading to the upregulation of adhesion proteins found on epithelial cells, which leads to the cellular invasion of pathogenic organisms [26] . For example, RSVand parainfluenza viruses upregulate intracellular and outer membranes proteins such as intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), P5-homologous fimbriae (P5 fimbriae), carcinoembryonic adhesion molecule-1 (CEACAM-1), and platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFr) [36, 37] . With the expression of these proteins, several bacterial organisms, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, are able to adhere to these molecules leading to invasion of the host's cells [36, 37] . 4) Production of viral factors: production of viral components such as neuramindase (NA), a glycoprotein produced by influenza and parainfluenza, and protein-Gexpressed on RSV cells-destroy the integrity of infected cells. This destruction exposes bacterial receptors and aids in bacterial co-infections [38] [39] [40] [41] . 5) Dysfunction of immune system components: respiratory viruses may affect the immune system by impairing neutrophil function, decreasing oxidative burst, and enhancing neutrophil apoptosis, thus increasing the susceptibility to bacterial superinfection [42, 43] . Also, viruses can predispose to bacteria superinfection by rendering natural killer (NK) cells recruitment and activation ineffective, which is seen with influenza and S. pneumoniae [44] . Viruses also alter monocyte function, decrease production and activity of cytokines, and prevent appropriate immune response routing, leading to enhanced bacterial colonization and increasing risk for mortality [45] [46] [47] [48] .",

            "text": "Because of the interaction between viruses and bacteria, there are many known specific virus-bacteria relationships ( Table 1) . For example, influenza interacts with both Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. The most common bacteria found in viral, secondary bacterial infections is S. pneumoniae [15] . S. pneumoniae has over 97 distinct serotypes and is a common cause of acute otitis media (AOM), pneumonia, sepsis, and bacterial meningitis [85] [86] [87] . One of the most common complications of influenza infection is AOM from either S. pneumonia or S. aureus [15, 88] . Since influenza is one of the common viral contributors to pneumonia, it also increases the rates of bacterial pneumonia from S. pneumoniae and S. aureus. This is because influenza with both of these bacteria has synergistic relationships using the mechanisms listed above [15, 26] . In addition, the bacteria increase influenza's infectivity by activating hemagglutinin on the membrane, thus neutralizing antibodies and allowing more virions to be replicated inside the host cell [15, 89] . Table 1 reviews the most common viral-bacterial co-infections and their associated complications. There are also reports of preceding bacterial infections leading to increase viral susceptibilities [26] . For example, S. pneumoniae and HMPV have a unidirectional synergistic relationship where S. pneumoniae predisposes children less than 2 years old to HMPV infections [90] . Similarly, H. influenza stimulates adhesion proteins on human epithelial cells, creating an entry point for rhinovirus [91] . Rhinovirus also has a bi-directional relationship with S. aureus: rhinovirus aids in the bacterial adhesion and engulfment into the epithelium cell and S. aureus promotes the replication of rhinovirus [70] . Rhinovirus can actually increase the nasal load of S. aureus by 39% over baseline [70] .",

In this study, RSV and S. pneumoniae co-detection was significantly associated with severe disease in the regression analysis. In a cohort study of children admitted with acute respiratory disease, bacterial superinfections were significantly associated with higher illness severity scores (OR = 2.12), more severe respiratory distress (OR = 4.4), required more respiratory support (OR 3.4), and have longer hospital length of stay [93] .

Looking at viral-viral co-infections, it seems that ultimately RSV seems to be the major decider of severity of infection whether or not the child has one or multiple viruses identified [96] . This information could influence the role of molecular testing in routine hospitalized patients. Viralbacterial co-infections, on the other hand, usually lead to more severe diseases. Overall, being able to better understand coinfection relationships can aid in the development of therapeutic methods as well as potentially affect the role of molecular testing.",
