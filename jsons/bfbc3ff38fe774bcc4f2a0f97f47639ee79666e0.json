Eighteen of the 20 amino acids in prokaryotes are encoded by more than one synonymous codon. The use of a synonymous codon is not random. During an organism's evolutionary history, a bias for a particular synonymous codon will be formed within a species or gene, which ensures that the most frequently used codons can pair with the anticodons of the most abundant tRNA genes. 15, 16 Since viruses do not encode translational functions and depend exclusively on the host cell machinery to synthesize viral proteins, the expression of viral genes is temporally regulated by adjusting the codons usage to match or contrast the host tRNA resources. The expression levels of papillomaviruses capsid proteins L1 and L2 depend on the match between the codon usage and tRNA availability in the host cells. 17, 18 The presence of low prevalence codons in hepatitis A virus genes facilitates the correct folding of HAV proteins. 19 Herpesviruses and human immunodeficiency virus maintain low prevalence codons in their genes. 20, 21 Considering such intimate dependence, codon usage bias analyses can provide useful insights into the adaptation of virus, the effect of the host on its codon usage, the factors driving the codon usage bias, and the regulation of viral gene expression.",

Cytosine deamination and selection of CpG suppressed clones by the immune system are major selective forces that shape codon usage bias in coronavirus genomes. 22 The nucleotide biases are more pronounced in the unpaired regions of the structured RNA genome, creating a virus-specific signature that may suggest a certain biological function for these distinctive sequence signatures. 23, 24 The codon usage bias analyses of MERS-CoV PLpro and 3CLpro proteases indicate a disproportional effect of compositional constraints and directed mutation pressure on codon usage in each protein. 25 The comparative analysis of human and animal MERS-CoV isolates suggests that mutational bias is a major determinant of codon usage bias in human/camel isolates, whereas natural selection pressure appeared to be the key determinant of codon usage in bat/hedgehog isolates. 26 Although the MERS-CoV genome is a mono-partite RNA, as many as 10 different proteins are expressed from a series of subgenomic mRNAs produced during virus infection. Nonstructural proteins are required for early stages of the viral life cycle and the presence of optimal codons may be desired for the rapid accumulation of these proteins in infected cells. On the other hand, structural proteins are potentially immunogenic and often required for late stages of the virus life cycle; therefore, the gradual accumulation of these proteins may be beneficial for virus replication without mounting a host immune response.",

We analyzed 4751 MERS-CoV genes from 664 complete or partial genomic sequences to determine the extent of codon usage bias and the relative contribution of various evolutionary forces in shaping codon usage. The effective number of codons (ENC) value showed a moderate, gene-specific codon usage bias in MERS-CoV genome. Codon usage bias is mainly shaped by translational selection, while mutational pressure emerged as a minor factor in some genes. CpG suppression and cytosine deamination along with the physical and chemical properties of encoded proteins are other factors that affect MERS-CoV codon usage preferences.",

The neutrality plot is an analytical method used to investigate the mutation-selection equilibrium in shaping the codon usage bias. 44 In a neutrality plot, average GC contents at the first and second synonymous codon positions (GC12) are plotted against GC content at the third synonymous codon (GC3s) position. The regression coefficient against GC3s is regarded as the mutation-selection equilibrium coefficient and the evolutionary speed of the mutation pressure and natural selection pressure is expressed as the slope of a regression line. A regression plot with a slope of zero indicates no effect of directional mutation pressure, while a slope of 1 is suggestive of complete neutrality.",

As shown in Figure 1A , the mean GC and AU compositions of MERS-CoV genome were 42.68 \u00b1 3.14% and 57.31 \u00b1 3.14%, respectively. The individual MERS-CoV genes exhibit similar strong compositional bias, except N and ORF8b genes with 47.309 \u00b1 0.20 and 49.283 \u00b1 0.19% G + C contents, respectively. The G + C content in the MERS-CoV coding sequence is not uniformly distributed. The G + C at first codon position is highest in all genes; however, the G + C at second and third codon positions are variable. In ORF4a, E, M, and ORF8b, the G + C at second codon position are lowest, while in ORF1ab, S, ORF3, ORF4b, ORF5, and N gene, the G + C at third codon position are lowest ( Figure 1B ). Further analyses of third-position wobble nucleotides revealed a significant abundance of A3s (0.309 \u00b1 0.053) and U3s (0.462 \u00b1 0.105), as compared to C3s (0.239 \u00b1 0.033) and G3s (0.195 \u00b1 0.06) ( Figure S1 ).

To determine the relative contribution of mutation pressure or natural selection on codon usage, the correlation among three codon positions (GC12vs GC3s) was determined. When GC3 was plotted against GC12 for all genes, no significant correlation was found (r = -.0.026, P = .074), suggesting that codon usage is not influenced by the mutational pressure. However, when GC3 of individual genes were plotted against the corresponding GC12, a significant correlation between GC3 and GC12 was observed for all genes, except ORF 4b (r = 0.028, P < .54). The slope of the individual neutrality plots indicates relative neutralities ranging from 1.6% to 35.52% ( Figure 3B ). The ORF3 had the highest relative neutrality values of 35.52% indicating a significant impact of neutral evolution (mutational pressure) on codon preference in this gene. Although highly significant correlations between GC3 and GC12 was observed in remaining genes, the slopes of regression lines indicate that less than 16% of codon usage bias in these genes is explained by mutational pressure. These data suggest that different evolutionary pressures are acting disproportionally on MERS-CoV genes. Mutational pressure appeared as a minor factor, affecting the codon usage preferences in some MERS-CoV genes, while natural selection emerged as the dominant factor influencing the codon usage in all MERS-CoV genes.",

The dinucleotide bias in MERS-CoV genome is not acute and only two dinucleotides, the CpG and UpA were markedly under-and over-represented, respectively ( Figure Among the differentially used dinucleotides, only CpG depletion was common across 9/10 MERS-CoV genes. To determine if CpG depletion is due to evolutionary pressures specifically acting on CpG dinucleotide and not due to composition constraint or pressures acting upon constituent nucleotides, CpG/GpC odds ratio were calculated ( Figure 4B ). High odds ratio would indicate that depletion was due to pressure acting upon constituent nucleotides, while low odds ratio would suggest implication of evolutionary pressures specifically acting upon CpG dinucleotide. With exception of ORF 3, ORF5A, and Envelope genes (CpG/GpC O/E 0.66, 0.70, and 0.859, respectively), the CpG/GpC odds ratio for all other MERS-CoV genes were less than 0.60, indicating that CpG depletion is not mere consequence of compositional constraints, rather it is due to evolutionary pressures specifically acting on CpG dinucleotides. To further understand the mechanism of CpG depletion, the loss of CpG dinucleotides, 1 \u2212 (O/E) CpG (20978) were over-represented. Taken together, these data suggest that depletion of CpG dinucleotides significantly affected the usage of CpG-containing codons in the MERS-CoV genome.",

            "text": "Natural selection and mutation pressure are two main factors that account for codon usage variation in different organisms. 34, 63 The ENC plot suggested that codon usage bias in MERS-CoV was not the sole result of the random accumulation of mutations. Despite the significant correlation between GC12 and GC3 for most of the genes, the slope of the neutrality plot suggests that only a fraction (< 16%) of codon usage bias in these genes is due to mutational pressure. Translational selection appears to be the major determinant of codon usage in MERS-CoV. Like many mammalian RNA viruses and retroviruses, 64, 65 the CpG dinucleotide is markedly underrepresented in the MERS-CoV coding sequence. The precise mechanism that contributes to CpG under-representation in RNA viruses is still largely unknown; the selection of CpG suppressed clones by host immune system and methylationdeamination are the most likely mechanisms responsible for CpG suppression in RNA viruses. 22 Studies of influenza and picornaviruses indicate that the innate immune response might recognize RNA-specific CpG motifs, such that the suppression of CpG in viruses could assist immune evasion. 66, 67 In contrast, other studies have suggested that dinucleotide bias in viruses simply reflects background mutation pressure. 55, 68 Comparative analysis of CpG suppression in coding and noncoding regions of the MERS-CoV genome indicates significantly lower CpG content in the MERS-CoV coding region than the non-coding region. The loss of CpG dinucleotides by deamination of methylated cytosines within CpG dinucleotides results in a gain of TpG and CpA dinucleotides. 64 However, the increase in UpG and CpA dinucleotides in the coding region was not much different than that in the noncoding region. This suggests that CpG suppression was not simply a consequence of host methylation capabilities; rather, it was a combined effect of multiple biochemical and evolutionary pressures specifically acting on CpG dinucleotide. 22 Viruses acquire replicative fitness by controlling the expression of viral proteins. Some viruses achieve high replicative rates by codon usage optimized genomes, while others evade host immune system and attain latency by codon usage deoptimized genomes. 19, 65 The mean CAI values in 0.708 \u00b1 0.027 in humans and 0.577 \u00b1 0.028 in dromedary camels indicate that MERS-CoV genes are significantly less expressive in dromedary camels as compared to humans. Similarly, the RCDI value of > 1.568 \u00b1 0.206 in humans and 1.805 \u00b1 0.275 indicate that MERS proteins are expressed in latency phases or even that the virus might present a low replication rate in dromedary camels. These subtle differences in protein expression among two hosts may explain the clinical manifestation of MERS-CoV infection. The MERS-CoV infection in humans is often acute with a high mortality rate, while clinical symptoms in camels infected with MERS-CoV are rare and generally mild.",

The formation of codon usage bias in the MERS-CoV genome is affected mainly by natural selection. Mutational pressure emerged as a minor factor affecting codon usage in some MERS-CoV genes. Dinucleotide bias, specifically the CpG suppression has significantly limited the use of CG containing codon. The depletion of CpG was a combined effect of evolutionary pressures specifically acting on CpG dinucleotide and compositional constraints imposed by the nucleotide composition of the genome. Other factors that influenced codon usage included the gene length and protein properties. The subtle differences in the levels of MERS-CoV gene expression in humans and dromedary camel and the sharp contrast in the severity of diseases between two hosts warrant further studies to determine the relationship between viral gene expression and severity of the disease. Several coronavirus proteins have been identified as interferon antagonist 69 and, by inference, optimal expression of these genes is essential for viral pathogenesis. Taken together, these results provided considerable insight into the genome composition and evolution of MERS-CoV and may provide a theoretical basis for optimizing MERS-CoV gene expression to study the functional relevance of various MERS-CoV proteins. Alternatively, with affordable and readily available gene manipulation tools, attenuated vaccine strains containing hundreds of silent mutations can be engineered to mitigate the chances of reversal to pathogenic wild type. 70 ",
