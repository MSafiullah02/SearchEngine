A data science solution [8]\u2014such as predictive analytics framework [1, 7]\u2014helps mining data from various big data sources to find useful information and discover knowledge, which can then be transformed into wisdom for appropriate actions. In this paper, we present an innovative big data predictive analytics framework over hybrid big data sources. Here, our predictive analytics model uses a hybrid of three different kernels (i.e., mathematical functions) in support vector machine (SVM):linear kernel,polynomial kernel, andRadial basis function (RBF) kernel.\n",

According to the WHO2, dengue virus has been transmitted by female mosquitoes\u2014mainly of the species Aedes aegypti (aka yellow fever mosquito) and Aedes albopictus (aka Stegomyia albopicta, Asian tiger mosquito, or forest mosquito)\u2014in recent years. Their incubation period ranges from 4 to 10 days. These mosquitoes are also vectors of other viruses such as chikungunya, yellow fever and Zika. Dengue is widespread throughout the tropics, with local variations in risk influenced by rainfall, temperature, relative humidity, and unplanned rapid urbanization. It has outbreaks in more than 100 countries worldwide, and is estimated to infect 50\u2013100 million people yearly. As infected humans are source of contamination for non-infected mosquitoes, the spread of the disease can be very fast. The first symptoms appear 2\u20137 days after the mosquito bite. There are four dengue virus (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4) with different severities in which symptoms range from severe headaches, fever, muscle and joint pains until plasma leaking, severe bleeding or organ damaged that can lead to death. A person that was infected by one of the virus gets immunized only for the specific one. There are no vaccinations available for dengue. The only way to stop the spread of the disease is preventing the procreation of the mosquito. Among the methods for prevention are the proper covering of water containers or any other material that accumulates water as the female mosquito needs water in order to lay its eggs. Also, during outbreaks the population can wear repellents, clothing that covers skin and install screens at windows and doors. The procreation occurs under some weather conditions (e.g., rainfall, temperature, relative humidity) and the population density.",

This lag comprehends the time that takes for the egg hatching, larvae period and lastly the mosquito born. High incidences of dengue cases in 9\u201316 weeks after some weather events in their findings are consequences of cumulative rainfalls, average high temperatures and humidity.",

Specifically, they used Google as the web-search tool for querying the frequency of the terms. They observed that people tend to search on the Internet for treatments and symptoms of a particular disease once they get sick. Hence, high frequency of a term (e.g., \u201cdengue\u201d) could be an indication of an epidemic. Back in 2005 and 2006, there were a high frequency of the search term \u201cbird flu\u201d due to the global spread of bird flu, especially in China and Turkey. Models for predicting influenza and dengue were created based on the frequency of terms. Such an idea has been incorporated into platforms such as (i) Google Flu Trends and (ii) Google Dengue Trends4, which are no longer publishing current estimates of flu or dengue fever based on search patterns. Despite the positive impacts of their approach, they also observed that external factors (e.g., media influence, language barriers, false positives) may affect the number of searches not correlating with actual cases of diseases. For example, media can drive such scenarios depending on what they publish. As another example, the same terms can be used to describe a variety of different situations with no correlation to diseases. Hence, as their models would need to be validated in each specific scenario before being used by health agencies, the models were not yet ready as replacement of existing methods used by health agencies.",

For example, for people go online searching for dengue, the model assumes the people have already contracted dengue (instead of suffering from other disease with similar symptoms). Moreover, there is possibility that people may misdiagnose their symptoms. Depending on the studied regions, there may be insufficient data due to limitations on Internet access by the population in the studied countries.
