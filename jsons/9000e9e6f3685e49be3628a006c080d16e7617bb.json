An interactive web-based mapping platform 1 (as shown in Fig. 1 ) that provides timely quantitative information on how people in different counties and states reacted to the social distancing guidelines was developed with the support of the National Science Foundation (NSF). It integrates geographic information systems (GIS) and daily updated human mobility statistical patterns derived from large-scale anonymized and aggregated smartphone location big data at the county-level in the United States [8, 7, 4, 3] , and aims to increase risk awareness of the public, support governmental decision-making, and help enhance community responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

People tend to change their travel behavior to slow down the spread of the novel coronavirus but spatial and temporal heterogeneity still exists. We use the U.S. mobility data released by the Descartes Labs [7] to map the daily human mobility changes. The mobility is represented by the maximum travel distance (km) to a location from the initial location of the day given a unique mobile device (i.e., individual max-distance mobility). To investigate the mobility changes, a baseline was first determined [7] , which was defined as the median of the max-distance mobility on the weekdays between 2/17/2020 and 3/7/2020 in the specified region (i.e., by county). By comparing daily mobility with baseline mobility, we can measure how people in each county react to COVID-19 by reducing daily travel distance (i.e., Social Distancing).",

The color saturation reflects the degree of changes. The darker the more mobility changes in a county. As March 15, 2020, two days after the U.S. Federal Government announced the national emergency, the people in most states in the Pacific Coast, Midwest, and East Coast had reacted actively to the social distancing guidelines and reduced their daily mobility (in Fig. 1 ). By zooming into the New York state (in Fig. 3 ), its median max-distance reduced to less than 0.1 km and decreased about 73% of that compared to the baseline. Despite warnings from health experts that drastic control measures are needed to slow the spread of the virus, people in the Franklin County (Florida) and the Monroe County (Florida), and many other counties in Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah and Wyoming still have increased daily mobility patterns (Fig. 1) since there was no statewide lock-down order yet. As of March 31, 2020, most states in the U.S. had issued fully shelter-in-place or partially safer-at-home and no large-group gatherings orders [1] , asking residents to stay at home and go out only for essential services, such as grocery shopping and medical cares. Thus, the spatial distribution of the mobility changes was dominantly in blue (decreased mobility) on that day except for some counties (as shown in Fig. 5 ), including Sutton County (Texas), Carbon County (Wyoming), Big Horn County (Montana), Millard County (Utah), Yuma, Prowers, and Lincoln counties (Colorado), and Pocahontas and Decatur counties in Iowa. The county/state mobility patterns may change over time if there will be some inevitable gathering events in near future (e.g., inperson voting in presidential primary).",
