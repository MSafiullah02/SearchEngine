The targeted tacrolimus level was determined to be between 6 and 8 ng/mL. During our first clinical evaluation, the patient's vital signs were within normal limits. The results of a physical examination of the heart, lungs, and abdomen were unremarkable. Only mild hyperemia of the tonsils and pharyngeal mucosa was noted as prominent findings. No other pathological findings were reported. Routine blood tests were run, and nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected for influenza A/B, respiratory syncytial virus. Since, at our institution, the prerequisites for COVID-19 testing were a reported body temperature over 38\u00b0C or cough and/or respiratory distress and an epidemiologic risk of contact, no swabs were collected for COVID-19. According to the blood test results, the patient's creatinine level was 0.92 mg/dL, GFR was 85 mL/min, white blood cell count was 3120/\u00b5L, total lymphocyte count was 300/\u00b5l, hemoglobin level was 11,4 gr/dl, platelet count was 211 000/\u00b5L, and tacrolimus level was 7.23 ng/ml. However, her CRP level was slightly elevated, at 5.7 ng/L. No pathological findings were reported on chest x-ray.",

Physical examination findings were unremarkable, including breath sounds on chest auscultation. The blood test results were similar to those from the previous day.

            "text": "Six days later, her swabs tests were reported to be positive for COVID-19. In the meantime, although she reported no high fevers or additional symptoms, the patient was admitted to the hospital for close monitoring and further testing. At the time of this admission, the patient had no complaints, and there were no positive physical examination findings suggesting a respiratory tract infection. A CT scan of the chest showed no pathological changes. All laboratory tests evaluating liver enzymes, kidney function, and acute phase reactants, including CRP, were within normal range except her total lymphocyte count, which was 800/\u00b5L. No change in vital signs or respiratory functions were observed during the 24-hour hospitalization for monitoring. She was discharged after 24 hours. Seven days after the discharge from the hospital she was seen in the clinic and swab tests were collected for COVID-19, which were reported to be negative afterward. To date, she has been healthy with no complaints at home for 14 days. et al also used hydroxychloroquine in addition to \"lopinavir + ritonavir\" or \"darunavir + cobicistat\"t treatment. They mentioned that the administration of colchicine may reduce the exaggerated inflammatory response observed in these patients. Unlike these previous cases, none of the five patients reported by Zhang et al were treated with hydroxychloroquine. Instead, their approach included supportive care and antiviral treatment of oseltamivir or arbidol. In addition, they did not reduce the immunosuppression in one of their patients. 14 Our review of the clinical courses revealed that most of the transplant patients were managed successfully without any progression of the disease. Only one transplant patient was lost due to quick respiratory deterioration before intubation.. 13 We did not discontinue our patient's immunosuppressive medication, because she was clinically stable and not critically ill. It is postulated that the over-activation of complement system or discordant expressions of type I and type II cytokines might lead to deficient viral clearance and exaggerated, prolonged inflammatory responses, which could result in a cytokine storm and the grave clinical course observed in coronavirus infections. 16, 17 Corticosteroids facilitate a reduction in systemic symptoms, such as fever or fatigue, and decrease alveolar exudation caused by the cytokine storm. 18 Colchicine may also alleviate this cytokine storm through a distinct pathway. 19 Therefore, we believe that strict precautions are necessary for contact isolation in transplant centers.",

            "text": "COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. The clinical manifestations are quite variable, which include asymptomatic carrier status, mild flu-like disease, acute respiratory disease, and severe disease, which necessitates intubation and mechanical ventilator support. Most of the patients with COVID-19 are reported to present with similar symptoms, such as fever, malaise, and cough. 5,6 Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are uncommon symptoms associated with this disease. Based on current epidemiological studies, the incubation period is between 1 and 14 days. No data have been published regarding the incidence and fate of asymptomatic carriers. According to analyses from China, 16%-18% of confirmed cases were severely ill patients. 5,7 The mortality rate of hospitalized patients could be as high as 28%, depending on different series. 1,4,5,8 So far, many potential drugs have been tested for the treatment of COVID-19. However, only remdesivir and chloroquine seem to be effective. 9,10 Older age, accompanying chronic illnesses, lymphopenia, and elevated procalcitonin and d-dimer levels were found to be related to severe disease and mortality. 8 Theoretically, renal transplant patients under immunosuppression may have deficiencies in clearing the SARS-CoV-2 virus and may exhibit more atypical clinical presentations than do the general population. Reports on the clinical course and treatment of renal transplant patients with COVID-19 are scarce, and currently, only a few case reports exist in the literature. 11-14All patients from these case reports presented with overt manifestations of COVID-19 symptoms. The most prominent symptoms were high fever and cough, both of which were reported in all patients.Table 1highlights the clinical manifestations, treatment choices, and clinical courses of the patients. Discontinuing immunosuppressive agents and starting wide-spectrum antibiotics were the initial treatment approaches for most of the patients. Zhu et al reported that they administered IVIG, steroids, and interferon \u03b1 in the treatment of their patient after the COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed. Guillen et al initiated hydroxychloroquine treatment in the following phase. Gandolfini",

            "text": ", she did not require either a specific treatment or placement in the intensive care unit during the disease. Our treatment strategy was to monitor the patient closely and intervene immedi-ately if needed.We agree with the general principle that viral infections mayhave a fatal course in transplant patients. Nevertheless, the risk factors defined for severe COVID-19, such as age, gender, and comorbidities, are also important in defining the course of COVID-19 in transplant patients. Our patient was a young woman without any accompanying disease. She appeared to have more favorable prognostic factors compared with the patients presented in the previous reports. The only possible negative prognostic factor for our patient was her high neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). However, the patient has had some degree of chronic lymphopenia for a long time, similar to many other transplant patients, and we think the validity of the NLR for these patients should be questioned. 15 When all these cases are taken into consideration, we can easily see the two extreme aspects of COVID-19: mild disease at one end of the spectrum and life-threatening, very severe respiratory disease at the other end of the spectrum. Our patient likely experienced the most common and mild form of the disease, as expected in the general population. However, extrapolating from such a small group of patients is impossible. Large-scale, multicentric studies with a high number of transplant patients are necessary to determine the percentages of different clinical manifestations of COVID-19.",
