With the increasing availability of complete genome sequences from multiple, closely related species, such comparisons are providing a powerful tool for genomic analysis. Using suffix trees-data structures that contains all of the subsequences from a particular sequence and can be built and searched in linear time-this computational task can be accomplished in minimal time and space. Because the suffix tree algorithm is both time and space efficient, it is able to align large eukaryotic chromosomes with only slightly greater requirements than those for bacterial genomes (2) .",

One such well-characterized region is the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) in the enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC). Thus, an EPEC infection results in effacement of the intestinal microvilli and the intimate adherence of bacterial cells to enterocytes. Furthermore, EPEC also subverts the structural integrity of the cell and forces the polymerization of actin, which accumulates below the adhered EPEC cells, forming cup-like pedestals (12) . This is called an attachment and effacing (AE) lesion. Subsequently, LEE was found in all bacteria known to be able to elicit an AE lesion (5).",

Even though the large PAIs play a major role in defining the phenotypes of different strains of the enteric bacteria, there are many other differences resulting from small insertions and deletions, which must be taken into account when considering the overall genomic picture of Enterobacteriaceae (5) . Thus, the comparisons between E. coli K12 and E. coli O157:H7 and between S. typhi and S. typhimurium have indicated the existence of many small differences that exist aside from the large pathogenicity islands. For example, the number of separate insertion and deletion events has shown that there are 145 events of 10 genes or fewer compared with 12 events of 20 genes or more for the S. typhi and S. typhimurium comparison. Furthermore, comparison between S. typhi and E. coli revealed 504 events of 10 genes or fewer compared with just 25 events of 20 genes or more. Even taking into account that the larger islands contain many more genes per insertion or deletion event, it becomes clear that nearly equivalent numbers of speciesspecific genes are attributable to insertion or deletion events involving 10 genes or fewer as are due to events involving 20 genes or more. These data should lend credence to the assertion that the acquisition and exchange of small islands is important in defining the overall phenotype of the organism (5) . In the majority of cases studied to date, there is no evidence to suggest the presence of genes that may allow these small islands to be self-mobile. It is far more likely that small islands of this type are exchanged between members of a species and constitute part of the species gene pool. Once acquired by one member of the species, they can be easily exchanged by generalized transduction mechanisms, followed by homologous recombination between the near identical flanking genes to allow integration into the chromosome (5) .",

A specific example to illustrate such a possibility is the observed capsular switching of Neisseria meningitides (34) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (35, 36) for which different sets of genes responsible for the biosynthesis of different capsular polysaccharides are found at identical regions in the chromosome and flanked by conserved genes. The implied mechanism for capsular switching involves replacement of the polysaccharide-specific gene sites by homologous recombination between the chromosome and exogenous DNA in the flanking genes (5) .",

Upon analysis, the genome of S. typhi contained more than 200 pseudogenes (15) , whereas it was predicted that the number of pseudogenes in the genome of S. typhimurium would be around 39 (16) . From this observation, it becomes clear that the pseudogenes in S. typhi were not randomly spread throughout its genome-in fact, they were overrepresented in genes that were unique to S. typhi when compared with E. coli, and many of the pseudogenes in S. typhi have intact counterparts in S. typhimurium that have been shown to be involved in aspects of virulence and host interaction. Given this distribution of pseudogenes, it has been suggested that the host specificity of S. typhi may be the result of the loss of its ability to interact with a broader range of hosts caused by functional inactivation of the necessary genes (15) . In contrast with other microorganisms containing multiple pseudogenes, such as Mycobacterium leprae (37) , most of the pseudogenes in S. typhi were caused by a single mutation, suggesting that they have been inactivated relatively recently.",

A critical step during the 2D PAGE procedure is the sample preparation, as there is no single method that can be universally applied because different reagents are superior with respect to different samples. To this end, chaotropes such as urea, which act by changing the parameters of the solvent, are used in most 2D PAGE procedures.

To this end, NIAID has made significant investments in large-scale sequencing projects, including projects to sequence the complete genomes of many pathogens, such as the bacteria that cause tuberculosis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and cholera, as well as organisms that are considered agents of bioterrorism. In addition, NIAID is collaborating with other funding agencies to sequence larger genomes of protozoan pathogens such as the organism causing malaria. The availability of microbial and human DNA sequences opens up new opportunities and allows scientists to perform functional analyses of genes and proteins in whole genomes and cells, as well as the host's immune response and an individual's genetic susceptibility to pathogens. When scientists identify microbial genes that play a role in disease, drugs can be designed to block the activities controlled by those genes. Because most genes contain the instructions for making proteins, drugs can be designed to inhibit specific proteins or to use those proteins as candidates for vaccine testing. Genetic variations can also be used to study the spread of a virulent or drug-resistant form of a pathogen.",

            "text": "r Large-Scale Sequence Analysis of Avian Influenza Isolates. Avian influenza is a significant global human health threat because of its potential to infect humans and result in a global influenza pandemic. However, very little sequence information for avian influenza virus (AIV) has been in the public domain. A more comprehensive collection of publicly available sequence data for AIV is necessary for research on influenza to understand how flu evolves, spreads, and causes disease, to shed light on the emergence of influenza epidemics and pandemics, and to uncover new targets for drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics. In this study, the investigators released genomic data from the first large-scale sequencing of AIV isolates, doubling the amount of AIV sequence data in the public domain. These sequence data include 2,196 AIV genes and 169 complete genomes from a diverse sample of birds. The preliminary analysis of these sequences, along with other AIV data from the public domain, revealed new information about AIV, including the identification of a genome sequence that may be a determinant of virulence. This study provides valuable sequencing data to the scientific community and demonstrates how informative large-scale sequence analysis can be in identifying potential markers of disease (50) .",

            "text": "Genome Sequencing Project. The analysis of the first 209 full genome sequences from human influenza strains, deposited in GenBank through the NIAID Influenza Genome Sequencing Project, was published in 2006 (51) . Influenza isolates were chosen in a relatively unbiased manner, allowing a comprehensive look at the influenza virus population circulating within the same geographic region over several seasons, which provided a real picture of the dynamics of influenza virus mutation and evolution. Analysis demonstrated that the circulating strains of influenza included alternative minor lineages that could provide genetic variation for the dominant strain. This may allow a novel strain to emerge within a human host and would explain the unexpected emergence of the Fujian influenza strain in 2003-2004 that resulted in a vaccine mismatch. These findings demonstrate the usefulness of full genomic sequences for providing new information on influenza viruses and lend further support for the need for large-scale influenza sequencing and the availability of sequence data in the public domain. Within the influenza community, public availability of influenza sequence data and sharing of strains has been an important issue. The NIAID has been instrumental in promoting the sharing of influenza sequence information, notably by sequencing more than 1,400 complete influenza genome sequences and depositing the sequences in the public domain through Gen-Bank as soon as sequencing has been completed.",

GAIN is a public-private partnership alliance with Pfizer Corp., Affymetrix, and NIH and managed by the NIH Foundation to bring new scientific and financial resources to NIH for genome-wide association studies (www.fnih.org/GAIN/GAIN home.shtml). Initially, Pfizer Corp. has committed US$20 million for management and genotyping capacity for five common diseases in partnership with Perlegen Sciences. Investigators were invited initially to submit applications to have genotyping performed on existing DNA samples from patients with specific diseases and control individuals in case control studies. The GAIN initiative proposes to raise additional private funds for genotyping of more common diseases. GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Studies). GWAS is a trans-NIH committee that is focused on developing an NIH-wide policy for sharing data obtained in NIH-supported or conducted Genome-Wide Association Studies. The policy is to focus on data sharing procedures, data access principles, intellectual policy, and issues related to protection of research participants. In 2006, the proposed policy has been shared with the scientific community for public comment as a NIH Guide Request for Information (RFI).",
