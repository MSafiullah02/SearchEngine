One of us (C.A.G.) was the Emergency Department (ED) consultant on-call for our 1400-bed teaching hospital over New Year and he correctly suspected that this was not a good omen for 2020. Unfortunately, that perception has come true with the emergence of the disease COVID-19, caused by the virus now known as 'SARS-CoV-2'. Hong Kong has vast experience of dealing with infectious disease outbreaks. Our hospital was the epicentre of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, and many of our staff have painful memories of the challenges and terrors brought by SARS. We have subsequently dealt with outbreaks of avian influenza, swine flu and now COVID-19 [2] . Our experience with multiple disease outbreaks has profoundly influenced our preparedness for the current epidemic. This outbreak comes at a difficult time for Hong Kong, which has had multiple episodes of civil unrest since May 2019 [3] .",

However, a local survey found that there are difficulties in fully adopting social distancing and in some cases, delays in diagnosis have increased the risk of community spread [7] . Memories of SARS from 2003 are still very fresh for many Hong Kong people and there has been great concern about the consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak. Surgical masks have been in very short supply, and for a time there was panic buying of rice, toilet paper and other basic goods despite there being no overall shortages throughout the city [8] .",

The switch to 'working from home' and 'schooling from home' in very small apartments has led to additional new pressures for a population which is much more familiar with daily commuting. Social distancing is good for infectious disease control, but social isolation can worsen mental health [11] and anxiety levels are reported to be borderline abnormal [7] .
