In China, the ocean economy is now seen as a critical component of that engine. Following the reform of economic trade policy, especially in the period 2001\u20142010, China's ocean economy has been growing rapidly, in line with national GDP. Also, as the second largest economy in the world, China is paying more attention to the sustainable development of its ocean economy. One important reason for this is that since joining the World Trade Organization (WTO), Chinese trade with other nations has steadily expanded as a proportion of national economic activity, to the point where it affects approximately 70% of China's economy [2]. China also has access to a significant marine resource base with a coastline of more than 32,000 km [3] and more than 7300 islands [4] in its territorial waters. Coupled with this, China has sovereign jurisdiction over a vast area of continental shelves and exclusive economic zones (EEZs) (as defined by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea) equal to approximately 3 million km2 of offshore waters. China also has marine oil reserves of an estimated 24 billion tons and natural gas reserves of over 1.6 billion cubic meters [5].",

According to Cheng [6], \u201cwithout trade, China could not sustain its economy, let alone maintain the growth rates necessary to maintain high employment figures\u201d. Ocean commerce in 2008 alone represented approximately 10% of China's gross domestic product (GDP), with a value of approximately $456 billion. Moreover, some 85% of its international trade moves by the sea lanes [2]. China's increasing reliance on oil imports to sustain its rapid economic expansion is a key element of this marine commerce. China imported over half of the oil it consumed in 2009, the majority of which was transported by tankers [7].",

            "text": "Since the productive land resources in China, as well as other countries around the world, are increasingly reaching the limits of economic and ecological exploitation, the value of the oceans as a resource for economic development has become increasingly more prominent. A number of coastal countries have launched programs explicitly aimed at strategic initiatives for the development of their ocean resources [2]. For example, in 2002 the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans launched Canada's Oceans Strategy which provides an overall strategic approach to oceans management in that country [8]. In July 2010, U.S. President Obama signed Executive Order #13547 establishing a National Policy for the Stewardship of the Ocean, Coasts, and the Great Lakes which aims to significantly improve the management of the U.S.'s marine resources [9]. Elsewhere, in 2011, the Irish prime minister launched Ireland's first national integrated marine plan entitled \u201cHarvesting our Ocean Wealth\u2014An Integrated Marine Plan for Ireland\u201d [10]. The Plan sets out actions and an implementation model which includes a number of integrated Government delivery mechanisms aimed at supporting an integrated system of policy and program planning for Irish marine affairs. Similar to these other nations, China has also been planning for the strategic development of the oceans as a resource for economic development. In 1996 the Chinese government unveiled the China Ocean Agenda 21 which put forward a sustainable development strategy for China's marine resources. The main aims of this strategy were to effectively safeguard the state's marine rights and interests internationally, provide protection for delicate marine ecosystems and realize the sustainable development of China's ocean economy [11].",

This paper provides a critique of this system and also uses it to define and quantify the ocean economy in China. While Song et al.

This paper also compares the Chinese OEAS to the marine economic accounting system used in the US and examines how closely the Chinese ocean economy follows the general movement in Chinese GDP.",

Compared with the commercial development of land, there is a relative lack of experience in relation to ocean development in China. There are many aspects of this ocean zonal approach that needs to be explored, not least the need to balance increasing the economic opportunities from China's vast marine resources with the need to protect the marine environment. Given this need, the Chinese State Department decided to choose some provinces as pilot marine economic development test sites. Now within the top strategic plan for the country, the development plans for 11 ocean economic development zones have become national strategies in China [18].",

The basic goal of defining and quantifying major ocean industries within the elementary account of the OEAS is to permit consistent measurement of the contribution of the ocean to the China economy across time and regions. Similar to many other ocean economy reporting exercises [19], [20], [21], [22], five basic steps are followed to quantify the Chinese ocean economy:1.\nSource the data.\nIn this step, the ocean economy activities are identified via government collected data within national accounts. These sources in China's case are outlined in Section 4.2.\nEstimate the ocean proportion within a sector.\nThis involves estimating the proportion of total economic activity within a particular sector that is ocean-related. For example, within the pharmaceutical sector a number of companies produce marine based bio-products. Distinguishing between marine and non-marine businesses within such a sector requires a more disaggregated look at the profile of the companies within this sector.3.\nCompile the data.\nThis involves recording the levels of value-added, employment and new measures for each industry that is identified within the marine sector.4.\nIdentify gaps.\nCertain ocean sectors are clearly identifiable within national account (for example marine transport and fishing) but for some other industries, in particular emerging ocean industries, it is more difficult to quantify the size and composition of the sectors. These industries and the data deficiencies need to be highlighted.5.\nOcean economy as a percentage of GDP.\nEstimate the value of the ocean economy relative to total economic activity in the wider economy.\n",

As previously noted, identifying the marine activity in national accounts can be difficult and often requires additional national accounts manipulation [23]. Examples of difficulties that can occur when trying to complete marine economic accounts include incomplete data on marine sectors, marine activities being part of statistical classes which also include non-marine businesses, indicators of marine activity being available at country level but not at local level and the issues surrounding the confidentiality of certain marine activities either for reasons of national security (in the case of defense) or for various other reasons, such as commercially sensitive activities or in cases where one business makes up too high a percentage of the total turnover of a given statistical class and can thus be too easily identified. These issues aside, Colgan [24] proposes four principles for developing a robust profile of ocean industries:1.\nComparability across industries and space.\nFor example, the definition of a unit of employment should be the same across all locations and industries.2.\nComparability across time.\nIndustry data should be observed and measured in a consistent manner over successive time periods in order to allow for trend analysis.3.\nTheoretical and accounting consistency.\nThe data should reflect standard economic theory describing the measurement of economic activity.4.\nReplicability.\nThe data should be replicable over time and form the basis of a future data series.\n",

This document sought to establish a statistical standard for ocean economy data collecting across all regions in China. The ocean industrial classifications within this document divided the marine sector into two parts; ocean industries and ocean related industries.\u2212Ocean industries refers to industries involved in the production or supply of service for developing, utilizing and/or protecting the ocean. This part of the ocean economy includes 12 major marine industries such as offshore oil and gas, marine mining, marine salt manufacturing, the marine chemical industry, marine biomedicine, marine electric power generation, seawater utilization, marine shipbuilding, marine engineering and construction, marine communications and transportation, coastal tourism, marine scientific research, and education.\u2212Ocean-related industries refer to the enterprises that form a technical and economic link with the major marine industries. These industries are defined as suppliers and customers of the ocean industries; they produce inputs for the latter or use outputs from the latter in the production process. Some of these activities are not necessarily performed at sea or even in the coastal zones. These industries include agriculture and mangrove forestry (that for example provide feed for marine use and that in turn use sea water to irrigate certain species of plants cultivated on Chinese wetlands), marine equipment manufacturing, ocean-related building and installation, marine wholesale and retail services, etc.\n",

In 2003, the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus broke out in China. SARS was the first severe and readily transmissible new disease to emerge in the 21st century [25]. This hit the Chinese economy heavily, especially the industries involved in international trade. Due to their export-oriented characteristics, the ocean industries were greatly affected. The fall in the growth rate of the ocean economy in 2009 was due to the financial crisis of 2007/2008, which is considered by many economists to be the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s [26]. A massive stimulus package from the Chinese government saw the economy through the worst of the financial crisis but still the growth rates of national GDP went down significantly, especially for the ocean related industries. It would therefore appear that the major ocean industries are more vulnerable to the impact of unexpected events (e.g. the SARS outbreak in 2003 and global recession in 2007) than the general economy. Also any events impacting on international trade have a higher impact on the ocean economy.

Coastal tourism was the largest contributor to China's ocean economy from 2006 to 2010. Coastal tourism includes hotels and lodging places, coastal tourism services, amusements and recreation, and coastal tourism and cultural services. The coastal tourism sector had been achieving growth rates of over 20% almost every year throughout the decade, greatly boosting the development of China's marine economy. For China's coastal tourism, 2003 was a significant year due to the outbreak of the SARS virus. Total tourism output had decreased dramatically in the first half of the year, and in the whole of 2003, the added value created by coastal tourism was $13.37 billion, down 27.39% compared to 2002. By the time that the World Health Organization lifted its two-month advisory warning against non-essential travel to China in late June 2003 the outbreak had cost China's travel and tourism industry sectors an estimated US$20.4 billion [27]. The tourism sector bounced back strongly in 2004 due in part to a rescue package from the government that included tax rebates, employment and training measures and financial aid. Also domestic and pan-Asian tourism boards put in place action plans to revitalize the stricken sector.",

The marine communication and transportation industry has long been the dominant support of China's international trade and continues to integrate markets between China and other countries. In the decade of 2001\u20142010, the marine communication and transportation industry had been growing rapidly due to the fast development of China's international trade.

In 2010, marine oil and gas output exceeded 50 million tons of oil equivalent, which makes China one of the world's major marine oil and gas producers. China's offshore exploration platforms are distributed both on coastal waters and in its deepwater territorial seas which increases the risk of ocean environmental pollution of the coastal area. The sharp drop in the value of the offshore oil and gas industry in 2009 was in line with global trends and was mainly due to the decline in international oil prices caused by the financial crisis.",

However, the share of the ocean based income in overall GDP is quite different, in China it is 4.03% (and this includes only the 12 major ocean industries classified in Table 1) while in the US it is only 1.82% (based on the fact that the national GDP of the USA is almost twice that of China). It would also appear that the indicative employment in China's ocean economy is much larger than that of America. The discrepancy between the shares of employment in the sector and the share of ocean based activity in the countries respective GDP would appear to indicate that labor productivity might be relatively lower in the Chinese ocean economy compared to the US ocean economy. However the real explanation is more likely to be reflected in the fact that in China 553,000 individuals are employed in the labor intensives primary production activity that is the marine fishery industry. In comparison, more persons are employed in higher value added industries in the US ocean economy. While shifting up this value added chain is an important objective for the Chinese ocean economy sector (as can be seen in the government's support for emerging industries such as marine energy, marine bio-medicine and marine technology and the fact that industries using marine high technologies have been growing rapidly at an average annual rate of more than 20% in the last decade), the importance of the primary fisheries jobs to rural China in particular should not be underestimated.",

Using a similar methodology to that developed in previous international studies, it was found that the major ocean industries produced US$239.09 billion in value added output in 2010 and accounted for 4.03% of China's national GDP. The major ocean industries were found to employ 9,253,000 individuals. This analysis also found that coastal tourism, marine communication and transportation industry and the marine fishing industry dominate in China's ocean economy. A time series analysis for the period 2001 to 2010 found that the Chinese ocean economy follows a very similar growth path to that of the national economy.
