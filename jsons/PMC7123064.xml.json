Looking back at its history, Taiwan used to have close relations with WHO. Chiang Kai-Shek\u2019s Republic of China (ROC) government was the founding member of WHO in 1948. After Chiang was defeated in the Chinese civil war and retreated to Taiwan, the ROC government maintained its membership for more than two decades. Under the aid and programs directed by WHO, Taiwan gradually improved its primary healthcare system. This connection was cut off when the Taiwanese government lost its UN seat to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in 1971 under UN resolution No. 2758. In the following year, the World Health Assembly (WHA), the main decision body of WHO, passed Resolution 25.1. In this Resolution, PRC also restored its rights as the representative of China in WHO. Taiwan\u2019s formal communication with the organization stopped. Taiwanese health officials interacted with WHO through indirect means, usually bridged by unofficial channels.1\n",

There were many unofficial activities pushing for Taiwan\u2019s return to WHO before the Taiwanese government took the initiative. The most significant example was the efforts made by the Foundation of Medical Professionals Alliance in Taiwan (FMPAT). FMPAT held lobbies for Taiwan\u2019s representation in WHO since 1995.2 These efforts initially received a cold response from the Taiwanese government. The government at the time believed it did not require professional assistance from WHO. The necessity of Taiwan\u2019s participation in WHO was relatively weak in terms of health policies (Chang 2010b).",

WHO was a good candidate because it dealt with professional issues concerning vital humanitarian needs.

Specifically, Taiwan\u2019s effort focused on joining the World Health Assembly (WHA), the ministerial intergovernmental meeting held every year in May. Taiwan did not apply for WHO membership because WHA Resolution 25.1 rejected Taiwan\u2019s legal status as a state. Taiwan would face the same sovereignty problem in the UN bidding if it attempted to overrule the WHA Resolution. It would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to successfully obtain a WHO membership. And there was no observer status in WHO. However, the WHA received observers. The WHO Constitution and Rule of Procedure of the WHA regulated an observer status that left a grey area for Taiwan. Under article three of the Rule, Taiwan might participate in the WHA under an invitation from WHO Director-General (DG) without being officially recognized as state or territory. In practice, WHA observers included a variety of sovereignty statuses. They included internationally recognized states like the Holy See, self-governing territories like Palestine, and international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) like the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The rules offered Taiwan an opportunity to participate in the WHA without clarifying its legal status. Therefore, being a WHA observer was an opportunity to participate in intergovernmental governance that was not available in other intergovernmental organizations (IGOs). This made the WHA bid a primary target for Taiwan\u2019s foreign policy.",

In terms of health governance, WHO had become the main body where states formulated and enforced health-related regulations (Frenk and Moon 2013). Global health governance focuses on transnational health risk, such as the spread of infectious diseases, border control and examination, food safety, and joint research and laboratory standards on examinations and treatments. In practice, WHO health governance consists of various networks or regulations, including International Health Regulations (IHR), the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN), and the International Medical Products Anti-Counterfeiting Taskforce (IMPACT). WHO contains the negative externalities of transnational health threats by providing public goods or medical services sponsored by developed countries. The networks it established since the end of Cold War allow health policy makers to exchange health information. They create professional cooperation among professional medical experts. WHO members regularly convene to review the progress of WHO projects. This makes WHO an effective monitoring power in global health governance. Although non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are also important contributors to global health, their governing power and ability to build networks between national health authorities cannot match the scale of WHO.3\n",

Instead of being a deserter of global health regulations, Taiwan showed great interest in conforming to the decisions made in the health governing bodies. Its compliance was grounded in two reasons. The first one was voluntary implementation. Taiwan voluntarily conformed to health-related rules and standards for two reasons. First, it wanted to improve its own health governance by \u201ccatching up\u201d to the global standards. These rules created short cuts for health policy formulation or provided reference for law-making in Taiwan. For example, the Taiwanese government voluntarily enforced the guidelines made by FCTC. Taiwan\u2019s tobacco control policy depends on the recommendations and research reports developed under FCTC conferences. Secondly, from Taiwan\u2019s perspective, its voluntary participation demonstrated the country\u2019s resolution to join intergovernmental health bodies such as the WHA and FCTC Convention of Parties. Taiwan\u2019s compliance echoed the government\u2019s foreign policy, showing that Taiwan was willing to take its part in global health governance. As a result, Taiwan\u2019s exclusion made its health authority more willing to implement international standards.",

The US usually provided consultations that facilitated the work of Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Taiwan gained the latest information about WHO activities from the US representatives who took part in WHO. Taiwan\u2019s diplomatic allies also create professional channels that connected Taiwan\u2019s internal health governance with the global one.

And Taiwan\u2019s representatives are absent in almost every intergovernmental meetings. Therefore, the Taiwanese government adopts indirect channels to acquire information regarding WHO activities. The most significant problem of Taiwan\u2019s current mode of participation is efficiency. The lack of a direct communication channel between Taiwan and the governing body creates an information gap. Taiwan cannot obtain the latest information released by WHO, neither can WHO obtain the latest health information inside Taiwan. Taiwan has no obligation to report its health information to WHO, and WHO will not request information from the Taiwanese government. According to the UN resolution, China is responsible for Taiwan\u2019s internal affairs, but in reality Beijing does not administer Taiwan\u2019s health affairs and therefore it is unable to report health figures regarding Taiwan. Even if the Taiwanese government voluntarily report its health figure to WHO, WHO might not accept because of the political dispute.",

Once Taiwan fails to contain a health risk, WHO cannot intervene, nor can it provide assistance to prevent further spread of the health risk. Information concerning a local health risk only passes through bilateral communication channels between Taiwan and its neighboring states. WHO members are thus exposed to potential health risks brought by Taiwan, and they can only rely on Taiwan\u2019s friendly allies to pressure the Taiwanese government to be a competent and responsible actor when dealing with transnational health emergencies.",

Despite the fact that being a WHA observer did not necessarily indicate the status of statehood, it was still a sensitive issue and the WHO/WHA bidding was difficult. The political ambition behind Taiwan\u2019s pursuit of being a WHA observer had been very obvious. Unsurprisingly, China adamantly opposed Taiwan\u2019s WHO/WHA bidding from the start. Between 1997 and 2008, Taiwan mobilized all its diplomatic relationships to participate in WHO, mostly aimed at attending the WHA. It rallied its diplomatic allies, lobbied foreign governments and their congresses, organized NGO support, and directed media attention to its bids. These activities aimed to raise issue salience and earn international support to fight against China\u2019s diplomatic blockade. Every year immediately after the WHA in May, the Taiwanese government began a new round of bidding. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) and Department of Health (DOH, now the Ministry of Health and Welfare) jointly set up main tactics for the next year. They mobilized overseas Foreign Service offices, produced media propaganda, and organized a series of conferences and activities. Government officials regularly established connections with important INGO leaders, foreign government officers, foreign congressmen, and even WHO officers. The Taiwanese government wanted to rally enough support from the international community to outweigh China and its allies. The following table shows Taiwan\u2019s bids from 1997 to 2016 (Table 1)\n",

Taiwan also gained support from professional INGOs. For example, the World Medical Association (WMA) has been a reliable ally.

The improvement of the cross-Strait relationship gave the Taiwanese government leverage to pressure Beijing through domestic politics. Under the doctrine of diplomatic truce, the government claimed in public that engaging China, rather than clashing with it, would bring more international space for Taiwan. This claim tied the hands of Ma\u2019s government (Fearon 1997), and the WHA bidding played a key role. The public held high expectations that China would lower its diplomatic barrier and help Taiwan\u2019s WHA accession. The failure of the WHA bidding would have resulted in a credibility crisis for Ma\u2019s foreign policy. The \u201cdiplomatic truce\u201d might have collapsed, and Ma\u2019s cross-Strait policy would have drowned with it. It would have decreased Ma\u2019s support, shaken the KMT government, and forced Mr. Ma to reconsider his Mainland policy. China would not welcome this development. China preferred KMT to remain in office rather than the DPP; it also preferred Ma\u2019s Mainland policy to his predecessor\u2019s. Moreover, the domestic criticism in Taiwan further strengthened the \u201ctying hands\u201d effect. The greater the domestic pressure on the WHA issue in Taiwanese politics, the more audience cost Ma had to suffer if the WHA bidding did not work out. China recognized that the domestic audience cost for the Taiwanese government would be high if there was no substantive outcome for Taiwan\u2019s WHA bidding. As a result, it made a mutually acceptable arrangement for Taiwan\u2019s observership. And it made sure that Taiwan was satisfied with the arrangement so Ma\u2019s government could demonstrate the effectiveness of \u201cdiplomatic truce\u201d to its people.

Its absence does not invalidate the governing network established by WHO. On the other hand, Taiwan has good performance in public health administration and a record of voluntary compliance with international standards. Zacher and Keefe (2008) argue that health governance arises when governments feel the threat of transnational health crises. The cost of non-compliance encourages states to increase surveillance and strengthen governance power. Taiwan is the opposite side of the story. The Taiwanese government makes substantive efforts to create a robust public health system, which makes Taiwan less likely a source of public health threats. Consequently, neither WHO members nor the WHO Secretariat find it necessary to include Taiwan in the current health governance system.",

Its geographical isolation also makes it easier for Taiwan to contain local epidemics from spreading to neighboring countries. Additionally, Taiwan finds it easier to filter foreign imported health risks given its modernized custom control and quarantine procedures. But the lack of immediate threat does not suggest that the current governance pattern is reliable, and it is certainly not risk-free. It is not inconceivable that Taiwan could pose a health threat to other countries. The food product scandals are examples. In 2011, the health authority in Taiwan accidentally found that an illegal plasticizer, DEHP, was used as a clouding agent to produce food, beverages, tablets, and powders. Later it was confirmed that the industry had used DEHP for decades. Products made of DEHP were exported to 22 countries (Wu et al. 2012; Yen et al. 2011). In 2014, another food safety incident involving cooking oil was discovered. Food made with recycled oil was exported to 12 countries (Wu 2014).",

The Taiwanese government has acted swiftly whenever health-related problems emerge, and it has promptly informed the affected countries through bilateral channels. The lack of monitoring mechanism means other countries depend on the merits of the Taiwanese government. There is no enforcement power that pressures the Taiwanese government to report a domestic health incident. Other countries, especially those who are affected, can only press for solutions through bilateral dialogue. The pressure from a global governance power is absent in the case of Taiwan. Moreover, WHO\u2019s advisory group cannot intervene even if such assistance helps Taiwan to resolve a health emergency more efficiently. Due to the difficulty acquiring help from WHO, Taiwan relies heavily on the US for technical advice. In sum, Taiwan\u2019s current pattern of participating in global health governance creates unnecessary risk for other countries. The restraint on Taiwan\u2019s compliance is obscure and uninsured. It is not guaranteed that Taiwan is capable of dealing with the health risk spreading to or emerging from the island. There is little force, if any, to ask Taiwan to behave responsibly in transnational health emergencies.",

It is uncertain whether the current governance pattern can protect other WHO members from any health risks originating in Taiwan. The problem remains that Taiwan\u2019s self-governance lacks transparency to the international community. The risk of Taiwan being a source of global health risk may be small, but WHO will find it difficult to contain health threats originating from Taiwan if Taiwan fails to contain a local epidemic outbreak or if it fails to secure the safety of its exported food products. Taiwan is deeply integrated into the global economy. Local health risks will easily transfer to the rest of the world.

The Taiwanese government maintains that being a responsible member will bring more friendship in Geneva and therefore more chances of participation.
