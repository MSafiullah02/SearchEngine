The larger granules, identified by a dense crystalloid matrix at electron microscopy, contain the characteristic cationic proteins major basic protein (MBP), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), and the enzymatic protein eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) [1, 2]. The smaller amorphous granules contain arylsulfatase and acid phosphatase. The process of degranulation by activated eosinophil releases cationic proteins into the extracellular space, with potential direct toxicity to the heart, brain, and bronchial epithelium. Degranulated eosinophils can be identified at electron microscopy by presence of cytoplasmic vacuoles, and loss of electron density of the central core of the granules (inversion or disappearance of core density). Molecular and intracellular pathways regulating eosinophil differentiation, priming, activation, degranulation, and mediator secretion, and how the release of toxic substances contributes to the pathophysiology of eosinophilic disorders, have become better understood on a molecular standpoint and are reviewed elsewhere [2]. In addition to cationic proteins, eosinophils release proinflammatory cytokines, lipid- and arachidonic acid\u2013derived mediators, enzymes, reactive oxygen species, and matrix metalloproteases, all of which may contribute to the pathophysiology of eosinophilic lung diseases.",

            "text": "The eosinophil is involved in many allergic or inflammatory processes through its interaction with other cells, including especially T helper (Th) lymphocytes, but also mast cells and basophils, endothelial cells, macrophages, platelets, and fibroblasts. Intercellular signaling is mediated by surface expression of adhesion molecules, apoptotic signaling molecules, chemokines, complement receptors, chemotactic factor receptors, cytokine receptors, and immunoglobulin receptors. For instance, eosinophils are capable of regulating mast cell function and histamine release. Eosinophils have further immune properties. They express the major histocompatibility complex II protein human leukocyte antigen (HLA)\u2013DR, can present the antigen to T-helper lymphocytes, and secrete an array of cytokines, thereby promoting effector T-cell proliferation. They can synthetise IL-4 and promote IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 secretion by CD4+ T cells (promoting Th2 lymphocyte activation), and secrete indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (indirectly promoting Th1 apoptosis), modulating the Th1/Th2 balance. Abnormalities in the T-cell receptor repertoire and T-cell clonotype of BAL lymphocytes and peripheral blood lymphocytes seem to contribute to the pathophysiology of eosinophilic lung diseases [3]. Overall, the paradigm of eosinophil function has changed from a terminal effector cell in allergic airway diseases to their being involved in the initial stages of pathophysiology.",

As the recruitment of eosinophils to the lung mostly implicates IL-5 and the eotaxin subfamily of chemokines (itself regulated by the Th2 cell\u2013derived IL-13 cytokine), those are the target of several drugs in development, which can potentially change dramatically the therapeutic landscape of eosinophilic disorders in the near future [4]. Other promising targets for therapy include the IL-5 receptor, CD2 binding protein, IgE, and IL-4/IL-13 receptor, with a few agents already at the stage of clinical evaluation. Although histopathologic lesions in eosinophilic pneumonias are largely reversible, tissue damage can occur especially in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), and in eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) (Churg-Strauss syndrome, CSS), with possible remodeling and fibrosis in the bronchial mucosa. It is unknown yet whether anti-IL-5 antibodies and other therapeutic agents that target eosinophil-specific molecules, may prevent tissue damage. In addition, newer drugs specifically targeting cytokines of the eosinophil lineage contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenic role of eosinophils [4].",

Although they can show characteristic features of eosinophilic pneumonia, transbronchial lung biopsies are generally not recommended due to the small size of the specimen that allows only partial morphologic evaluation. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is now considered a good surrogate of lung biopsy to demonstrate lung eosinophilia, although no study has definitely established a correlation between increased eosinophils at differential cell count and eosinophilic pneumonia at lung pathology. In normal subjects, BAL eosinophilia is lower than 1 % of cells at differential count. In contrast, BAL eosinophilia greater than 40 % is found mainly in patients with chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, whereas BAL eosinophilia between 3 and 40 % (and especially between 3 and 9 %) may be found in various interstitial lung diseases other than eosinophilic pneumonia. A conservative cutoff of 40 % of eosinophils at BAL differential cell count has been adopted for the diagnosis of ICEP in clinical studies [12, 13], and a cutoff of 25 % has been proposed for the diagnosis of IAEP [14]. We recommend that a clinical diagnosis of eosinophilic pneumonia be supported by alveolar eosinophilia when the eosinophils (1) are the predominant cell population of BAL cell count (macrophages excepted) and (2) represent more than 25 % of differential cell count (with greater specificity when greater than 40 %).",

It may be missing in patients who have already received systemic corticosteroids, and it is often absent at presentation in IAEP. Blood cell count must thus be done before starting corticosteroids. Blood eosinophilia is defined by an eosinophil blood count greater than 0.5 \u00d7 109/L, and hypereosinophilia by an eosinophil blood count greater than 1.5 \u00d7 109/L on two examinations at least 1 month interval, and/or tissue hypereosinophilia [15]. Blood eosinophilia greater than 1 \u00d7 109/L (and preferably hypereosinophilia) may obviate the need to perform BAL in individual cases with typical presentation. For example, BAL may occasionally be omitted to confirm L\u00f6ffler\u2019s syndrome (as it occurs in ascariasis) in a patient with mild cough, wheezes, transient pulmonary opacities at chest radiograph, and frank blood eosinophilia. However BAL is generally useful to rule out alternative diagnoses (such as bacterial or parasitic pneumonia, or pulmonary infiltrates related to Hodgkin disease), and BAL is recommended to confirm the diagnosis of eosinophilic pneumonia in most cases.",

Centrilobular nodules (less than 20 % of cases) [19], consolidation with segmental or lobar atelectasis, can also be seen. Upon corticosteroid treatment, consolidation rapidly decreases in extent and density, possibly evolving to ground-glass attenuation or inhomogeneous opacities, and later to streaky or bandlike opacities parallel to the chest wall. Cavitary lesions are extremely rare and should lead to reconsideration of the diagnosis. Reverse halo sign that is very suggestive of organizing pneumonia is rare contrary in ICEP. Pleural effusions (which are common in IAEP) are rare and usually mild or moderate in ICEP. Mediastinal lymph node enlargement may be seen in 15\u201320 % of cases [13].\n",

Long-term steroid use may lead to osteoporosis.

Most patients have no prior asthma history [17]. However, taking a thorough exposure history is mandatory, as a causative role of cigarette smoke is established. Most patients have been recently exposed to dust or cigarette smoke within the days before onset of disease, and often will have begun to smoke, restarted to smoke, or increased the number of cigarettes smoked daily, especially within 1 month before the onset of \u201cidiopathic\u201d AEP [29, 31]. The disease is therefore often not \u201cidiopathic\u201d, being initiated or triggered by inhaled nonspecific causative agents in susceptible individuals, however it can occur in the absence of any inhaled exogenous trigger. AEP may develop soon after the initiation of smoking especially when starting with large quantities, and may relapse \u2013 not always \u2013 in patients who resume cigarette smoking [29, 31]. Flavoring components of smoked cigars have been suspected. In addition, the onset of IAEP seem to follow in some patients outdoor activities or peculiar exposures, such as cave exploration, plant repotting, wood pile moving, smokehouse cleaning, motocross racing in dusty conditions, indoor renovation work, gasoline tank cleaning, explosion of a tear gas bomb, or exposure to World Trade Center dust [14, 30, 32].",

The chest x-ray returns to normal within 3 weeks [14, 30], with pleural effusions being the last abnormality to disappear [14]. Typical computed tomography (CT) abnormalities include ground-glass attenuation and air space consolidation (Fig. 15.4), with poorly defined nodules. Interlobular septal thickening and bilateral pleural effusion seen in a majority of patients are highly suggestive of the diagnosis in the setting of eosinophilic pneumonia [14, 18, 27, 30, 33] (or in a patient spuriously suspected to have infectious pneumonia).\n\n",

Recovery of IAEP can occur without corticosteroid treatment [30, 34], and therefore improvement concomitant with corticosteroid treatment is not a diagnostic criterion of IAEP. In most patients diagnosed with IAEP, a corticosteroid treatment is initiated, with initially intravenous methyl prednisolone later changed to oral prednisone or prednisolone that can be tapered over 2\u20134 weeks [14]. FiO2 may be decreased within a few hours of corticosteroid treatment in many patients initially requiring oxygen [14]; most patients are rapidly weaned from the ventilator. The clinical improvement begins within 3 days [29]. The chest x-ray is normalized within 1 week in 85 % of patients, but mild pulmonary infiltrates and pleural effusion may still be present at CT at 2 weeks [29]. One recent study of 137 patients suggested that a treatment duration of 2 weeks may be sufficient, with an initial daily dose of 30 mg of prednisone (or 60 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone every 6 h in patients with respiratory failure) [29]. No relapse occurs after stopping corticosteroid treatment, in contrast with ICEP (Table 15.4).\n",

Heart involvement mostly results from eosinophilic myocarditis, and rarely from arteritis of the larger coronary arteries [51, 52]. Although marked improvement usually occurs with corticosteroid treatment, heart involvement in EGPA may require heart transplantation, with possible recurrence of eosinophilic vasculitis in the transplanted heart. A strict cardiac evaluation is therefore warranted in any patient with suspected EGPA, generally including electrocardiogram, echocardiography, serum level of troponin, and magnetic resonance imaging of the heart. Cardiac MRI frequently shows late enhancement of the myocardium [53\u201355], which may correspond to myocarditis, however the absence of a gold standard, it is difficult at a given point in time to differentiate irreversible scar lesions from active inflammation requiring intense immunosuppression, and incidental findings from clinically relevant myocardial involvement. Treatment decisions are eventually based on critical clinical evaluation, taking into account results from several investigations, including electrocardiogram, echocardiography, troponine level, and possibly a combination of cardiac MRI and positron emission tomography. In addition to myocardial involvement, asymptomatic pericarditis with limited effusion at echocardiography is common, with rare cases of tamponade, and the risk of venous thromboembolic events [56] is increased in patients with EGPA. Endomyocardial involvement (typically seen in idiopathic HES) is uncommon in EGPA.",

In contrast to GPA, pulmonary cavitary lesions are exceptional. The chest x-ray may remain normal throughout the course of the disease. Mild pleural effusion and phrenic nerve palsy can be observed. On thin-section CT, ground-glass attenuation and air space consolidation predominate, with peripheral or random distribution (Fig. 15.6). Bronchial wall thickening or dilation, interlobular septal thickening, hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pleural effusion, or pericardial effusion [18, 58, 59] are less commonly found. In one study, centrilobular nodules were more frequent in EGPA than in patients with ICEP [19]. However, EGPA is difficult to differentiate from other causes of eosinophilic lung diseases on the basis of HRCT imaging [18]. Importantly, pleural effusion when present may correspond to either inflammatory eosinophilic exudate directly related to EGPA or to a transudate caused by cardiomyopathy.\n",

Other possible triggering factors include Aspergillus, allergic bronchopulmonary candidiasis, Ascaris, bird exposure, or smoked cocaine. Some drugs have been suspected to induce EGPA, especially sulfonamides (used together with antiserum), diflunisal, macrolides, diphenylhydantoin, and more recently the anti-IgE antibody omalizumab [65]. In addition, leukotriene-receptor antagonists (montelukast, zafirlukast, pranlukast) have been suspected to be involved in the development of EGPA, although their role is controversial [49, 66\u201370]. The occurrence of EGPA is more frequent in patients receiving leukotriene receptor antagonists, however there is conflicting evidence whether the association is coincidental, whether some cases of smoldering EGPA flare because of reducing oral or inhaled corticosteroids, or whether these drugs really exert a direct facilitating or triggering role on the vasculitis [24, 68]. A possible mechanistic link has been proposed [71]. Since EGPA may follow montelukast treatment in asthmatic patients without smoldering EGPA, may recur on rechallenge with the drug, and may remit on its withdrawal [66, 68], a causal relationship cannot be excluded [70], and we advocate that leukotriene receptor antagonists be avoided in patients with asthma, eosinophilia, and/or established or smoldering extrapulmonary manifestations.",

She had no history of allergic manifestations. Severity of asthma had increased over the past year, and montelukast had been prescribed 4 months ago by her general physician in addition to her long-term treatment with inhaled long-acting corticosteroids and bronchodilators. On admission, she presented with acute exacerbation of asthma, nasal obstruction with nasal crusts, asthenia, arthralgia, palpable purpura of the lower extremities, and was further diagnosed with mononeuritis multiplex. The chest radiograph showed areas of ground glass opacity, with further patchy peripheral bilateral alveolar consolidation at chest CT. Peripheral blood eosinophils were 5.6 \u00d7 109/L. Differential cell count of bronchoalveolar lavage demonstrated 65 % eosinophils, 4 % neutrophils, 7 % lymphocytes, and 24 % macrophages. Skin biopsy showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. Electrocardiogram, echocardiography, and serum troponine level were normal. Pulmonary function tests showed airflow obstruction, with marginal improvement with inhaled bronchodilators. The patient was diagnosed with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and was treated with oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg per day for 1 month then progressively tapered). Montelukast was discontinued. Complete remission was obtained. Three years later, the patient complains of chronic rhinosinusitis, dyspnea on exertion with nonreversible moderate airflow obstruction despite high-dose inhaled anti-asthmatic therapy and 5 mg/day of oral prednisolone. Peripheral blood eosinophils are in the normal range. There are no sequelae of systemic manifestations.",

Patients with ANCA have a vasculitic phenotype of disease with an increased frequency of extracapillary glomerular lesions, peripheral neuropathy, purpura, and biopsy-proven vasculitis. In contrast, patients without ANCA have more frequent cardiac and pulmonary involvement (and fever), suggesting an eosinophilic tissue disease phenotype, and conceivably representing a variant of the HES with systemic manifestations [61]. Interestingly, genetic predisposition affects the phenotype of EGPA. The vasculitic phenotype of EGPA is more frequent in individuals carrying the major histopathology complex DRB4 allele, whereas the IL-10-3575/1082/592 TAC haplotype is associated with ANCA-negative EGPA phenotype.\n",

Lymphocyte phenotyping by flow cytometry to detect a phenotypically aberrant T-cell subset, and analysis of the rearrangement of the TCR genes in search of T-cell clonality on the peripheral blood (and possibly bone marrow), are therefore key to the diagnosis. Demonstration of increased IL-5 expression from cultured T-cells can also contribute to the diagnosis.

It has been reported mostly in Indians, and occasionally in patients originating from India or Asia and living in western countries. It is characterized by severe spasmodic bronchitis or chronic dry cough (exacerbated at night), often associated with expiratory dyspnea and wheezing, fever, loss of weight, anorexia, leukocytosis, high blood eosinophilia, and disseminated bilateral opacities at chest x-ray. Eosinophilic pneumonia is generally seen 1\u20133 months after infestation. Blood eosinophilia is prominent, with more than 2 \u00d7 109 eosinophils/L in all cases, and up to 60 \u00d7 109/L in some cases. BAL shows intense alveolitis with a mean percentage of 54 % of eosinophils with marked degranulation. Because the circulating microfilariae are trapped in the lung vasculature, they are usually not found in the blood or the lung. BAL eosinophils drop within 2 weeks upon anti-parasitic treatment. Lung function tests show a restrictive ventilatory defect, with a reversible obstructive ventilatory defect and hypoxemia in about a quarter of the patients. Nonspecific opacities are present on chest x-ray and CT in a majority of patients; irregular basilar opacities may persist for longer than 1 year. The diagnosis is made by the combination of cough worse at night; residence in a filarial endemic area; eosinophil count greater than 3,300 cells/mm3; and clinical and hematologic response to diethylcarbamazine. The latter is the only effective drug for tropical eosinophilia. Association of corticosteroids to diethylcarbamazine may be beneficial.",

In addition to mechanisms associated with innate and acquired immunity, ABPA can occur preferentially in genetically susceptible hosts, as suggested by increased prevalence of heterozygotic cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene mutations [111, 112], and association with a polymorphism within the IL-4 receptor \u03b1-chain gene and HLA DR subtypes. Infection with nontuberculous mycobacteria [113], infliximab therapy for sarcoidosis [114], and occupational exposures (in workers in the bagasse-containing sites in sugar cane mills) [115] may also contribute to the pathogenesis of ABPA. In addition to Aspergillosis, other fungi or yeasts can cause a similar syndrome of allergic bronchopulmonary disease (reviewed in [116]), with difficulties in assessing the sensitization to the specific fungi probably accounting for part of the low frequency of this condition as compared to ABPA.",

The expectoration of mucous plugs, the presence of Aspergillus in sputum, and late skin reactivity to Aspergillus antigen [117] are also frequent findings that contribute to the diagnosis when present. Typical proximal bronchiectasis may be absent in cases designated ABPA-seropositive [119]. Of note, patients who are negative for Aspergillus fumigatus-specific IgE are unlikely to have ABPA, a feature that is helpful to rule out the disease in severe asthmatics [108].

Bronchiectasis represent the ultimate consequence of damage to the large bronchi by chronic inflammation. Mucoid impaction of high attenuation on CT represent mucous plugs containing Aspergillus obstructing the airways with subsequent atelectasis. Mosaic attenuation, centrilobular nodules, and tree-in-bud opacities are also commonly seen. The presence of bronchiectasis, centrilobular nodules, and mucoid impaction on CT scan are highly suggestive of ABPA in an asthmatic (Figs. 15.8, 15.9 and 15.10) [123]. Agarwal et al. have suggested a classification based on CT imaging pattern between serological ABPA (without bronchiectasis), ABPA with bronchiectasis, ABPA with high-attenuation mucus, and ABPA with pleuropulmonary fibrosis [108].\n\n\n",

            "text": "Management of asthma is of primary importance in ABPA, often requiring high dose inhaled corticosteroids (which may reduce the need for long-term oral corticosteroids) and long acting bronchodilators. In addition, oral corticosteroids are used during acute exacerbations, with rapid tapering. Oral corticosteroids are maintained on the long-term only in patients with frequent symptomatic attacks or chronic symptoms, with the objective of preventing the progression to the fibrotic end stage, although with low-level evidence. In two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies [124, 125], oral itraconazole allowed reduction of the doses of corticosteroids, decrease in the number of exacerbations [125], and improvement of biologic (sputum eosinophils, sputum ECP levels, serum IgE levels, and serum IgG levels to A. fumigatus) and physiologic criteria, suggesting a clinical benefit in approximatively 60 % of patients with ABPA [126], especially those with corticosteroid-dependent ABPA; no significant effect was observed on pulmonary infiltrates [127]. Itraconazole is therefore recommended in ABPA in asthmatics [128]. It may also be useful in ABPA patients with cystic fibrosis [126, 129]. Itraconazole therapy is generally continued for a minimum of 4\u20136 months. Monitoring total serum IgE level may be helpful, with an objective of reducing the serum total IgE level by \u226525 % with therapy [108]. Itraconazole interacts with many medications, with a risk of adrenal insufficiency; due to frequent drug interactions, the use of oral prednisone, and inhaled beclomethasone or ciclesonide, should be preferred to that of oral methylprednisolone and inhaled budesonide or fluticasone [126].",

Patients often have a history of asthma or allergy, presumably with a Th2-oriented lymphocyte response. Pulmonary opacities at imaging may be unilateral (irradiated lung) or bilateral, and occasionally migrate. Peripheral blood eosinophilia greater than 1.0 \u00d7 109/L and/or eosinophilia greater than 40 % on the BAL differential cell count distinguish this syndrome from organizing pneumonia primed by radiation therapy to the breast. Rapid improvement is obtained with oral corticosteroids, with possible relapse after treatment withdrawal.",

Asthma is frequent in eosinophilic lung diseases, especially ABPA, ICEP, and EGPA. BAL has shown mildly increased levels of eosinophils (usually <5 %) on differential cell count in asthmatics. The eosinophilic phenotype of asthma, with eosinophilic airway inflammation and often little or no increase in the peripheral blood eosinophil numbers, is a marker of steroid-responsive disease, with a high risk of exacerbations, and may respond to anti-IL5 monoclonal antibodies [139]. Patients with asthma and high-level blood hypereosinophilia (i.e., >1.0 and especially >1.5.10\u22129) or alveolar eosinophilia (>25 % and especially >40 %), considered to have \u201chypereosinophilic asthma\u201d [140, 141], frequently require high-dose inhaled or even oral corticosteroids, and should be monitored closely as they may progress to EGPA, ABPA, hypereosinophilic obliterative bronchiolitis, or ICEP.",
