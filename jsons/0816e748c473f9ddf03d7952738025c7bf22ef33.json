Methods: In this nationwide prospective study on Swedish lung transplant patients, we evaluated the microbiological panorama of bacteria, fungi, and virus found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) obtained the first year after lung transplantation (LTx). Differences in microbiological findings depending of concomitant signs of infection and background factors were assessed. Results: A total of 470 bronchoscopies from 126 patients were evaluated. Sixty-two percent (n = 293) of BALF samples had positive microbiological finding(s). Forty-six percent (n = 217) had bacterial growth, 29% (n = 137) fungal growth, and 9% (n = 43) were positive in viral PCR. In 38% of BALF samples (n = 181), a single microbe was found, whereas a combination of bacteria, fungi or virus was found in 24% (n = 112) of bronchoscopies. The most common microbiological findings were Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and coagulase negative Staphylococcus (in 42 (33%), 36 (29%), and 25 (20%) patients, respectively). Microbiological findings were similar in BALF from patients with and without signs of lung infection and the frequency of multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria was low. No significant association was found between background factors and time to first lung infection. Conclusion: This study gives important epidemiologic insights and reinforces that microbiological findings have to be evaluated in the light of clinical symptoms and endobronchial appearance in the assessment of lung infections in lung transplant patients.

Most studies on microbiology in lung transplant patients evaluate infection episodes, but very few report all microbiological findings in BALF. In this prospective study, we analyzed for the first time the total microbiological panorama found in BALF in Swedish lung transplant recipients. We found that 85% of patients had samples with positive microbiologic finding(s), and only 15% of patients remained negative throughout their bronchoscopies. In line with our findings, Charlson et al 13 found that lung transplant recipients have a higher bacterial burden in BALF than healthy control subjects, regardless of underlying indication for transplantation. The single most common bacterium was P. aeruginosa, both overall and in samples with signs of lung infection. P. aeruginosa is previously well described as an important pathogen in lung transplanted patients. 2,5,14 Not surprisingly, P. aeruginosa, and other Gram-negative bacteria, were significantly more frequent in patients with cystic fibrosis. The fact that the study participants underwent varying numbers of bronchoscopies may result in overrepresentation of individual microbes.

Thus, our results indicate that the peri-operative antibiotic prophylaxis and later empiric antibiotic therapy at present not necessarily has to include specific targeting of MDR bacteria in Swedish lung transplant patients. Candida dominated in BALF-cultures the first post-operative month. In line with our data, Kovats et al 17 report a high Candida burden the first months after LTx. Candida was present in 32% of all samples with concomitant signs of lung infection, but only 15%had Candida as a single pathogen. All had signs of tracheobronchitis, which corresponds to an incidence of Candida tracheobronchitis of 12%, assuming that Candida was the causative pathogen. This number is high compared to a study on 384 heart and/or lung transplant recipients, where an overall incidence of invasive Candida infections of 8.3% was described, of which tracheobronchitis represented 38% and pneumonia 3.1%.21 However, a broad antimicrobial postoperative treatment the first month after LTx may cause negative bacterial BALF cultures and promote Candida dominance in lung infections in our study.Forty-five percent of patients experienced at least one episode with symptoms of lung infection during the first year after transplantation. A limitation of the study is that we did not take additional cultures/PCR from blood, sputum or nasopharyngeal into account. Another limitation is that we did not evaluate patients with culture-negative samples for signs of infection, which is why the true frequency of lung infections may be underestimated.Although, our results are comparable to other studies that report a frequency of lung infections between 30% and 70%.2,4,6,14,22,23 The incidence of lung infections in our study decreased over time.Similar results have been reported in other studies, where the first three post-operative months have been defined as the critical period for infections in lung transplanted patients, especially for bacterial etiology.5,24 Consistent with previous studies, we found no significant association between positive donor cultures and later microbiological findings in the absence or presence of lung infections.25,26 The microbiologic panorama found in BALF from patients with clinical signs of lung infection was similar to that found in samples from patients without symptoms in our study. However, it is important to note that we did not evaluate the probable causative pathogen. Since several microbiologic agents were found in 40% of BALF from patients with signs of lung infection, the causative microbe was difficult to determine. In addition, we lack information about concomitant antimicrobial treatment that may interfere with microbiological results, as well as how treatment of specific patho-gens influences the clinical outcome. About half of the patients with signs of lung infection had a previous bronchoscopy with the same microbe found in BALF, suggesting that the microbiology results of a previous bronchoscopy could guide antibiotic treatment in about half of the cases. In particular, previous cultures with P. aeruginosa should be targeted in empiric treatment. In conclusion, a majority of bronchoscopies from lung transplant patients during the first year after LTx had positive microbiologic findings, often with several pathogens. Previous BAL cultures, in particular findings of P. aeruginosa, could guide empiric treatment of airway infections, which suggests a role for surveillance bronchoscopies. The frequency of MDR bacteria was low in our study, indicating that empiric therapy does not need to include MDR bacteria at present in Sweden. Microbiological findings were similar in BALF from patients with and without signs of lung infection. The results reinforce that microbiological findings have to be evaluated in the light of clinical symptoms and endobronchial appearance in the assessment of lung infections in lung transplant patients.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
