Ferritin, PCT, and phosphorus levels were not only useful in identifying mimics of swine influenza pneumonia, i.e., bacterial causes of CAPs, including legionnaire's disease, but were an additional check to rule out H1N1 pneumonia. Swine influenza (H1N1) pneumonia is not associated with increased PCT, ferritin levels or hypophosphatemia.

            "text": "The present case is emblematic of other cases of fatal H1N1 pneumonia in young adults. It is important to note that the age distribution of fatalities differs between human seasonal influenza A and pandemic influenza (human, avian, and swine). The hallmark of pandemic influenza is a change in the age distribution of early fatalities among the population. With nonpandemic human seasonal influenza, most fatalities are among the very young, and the elderly. In contrast, most early fatalities in pandemic influenza (human, avian, and swine) are among healthy young adults. This difference in the distribution of fatalities is known as the \u201cpandemic signature.\u201d The same \u201cpandemic signature\u201d was evident during the 1918-1919 influenza A pandemic.11, 12 The majority of fatalities in the 1918-1919 pandemic were healthy young adults, e.g., military recruits. Much of the confusion regarding the main cause of death during the 1918-1919 influenza A pandemic relates to bacteriologic reports. Bacteriologic specimens were taken from lung autopsy specimens under the suboptimal conditions imposed by warfare in staging areas. Autopsy lung cultures, under the best of conditions, are often contaminated with respiratory flora by non-aseptic specimen collection. The suggestion that most deaths were caused by a bacterial superinfection during the 1918-1919 pandemic are based on such questionable microbiologic data.11, 12 However, the predominant and irrefutable pathologic evidence indicates that the majority of deaths in young healthy adults were attributable to influenza pneumonia without bacterial infection.13, 14, 15, 16, 17\n",

These cases were clinically recognizable because, in addition to the findings of influenza, the patients presented with infiltrates on CXR that rapidly cavitated within 72 hours. Such individuals also had high spiking fevers, cyanosis, and hypotension and a fatal outcome was not uncommon. Other individuals, usually older patients with comorbidities, subsequently developed S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae CAP after \u223c1 week of improvement following influenza.

Although SARS is arguably not an ILI, it is transmitted via aerosol or droplets, and is often fatal, in common with pandemic influenza (human, avian, and swine). In terms of pathology, not pandemic spread, the avian influenza H5N1 experience in Asia and Europe provides a more accurate, comparison with H1N1 pneumonia in terms of bacterial superinfection. The fatalities of avian influenza (H5N1) pneumonia were exceedingly high, e.g., about 60%. The mortalities with avian influenza (H5N1) occurred predominantly among healthy children and young adults. Although avian influenza (H5N1) strains are highly virulent, the efficiency of bird-to-human or human-to-human transmission has fortunately been inefficient, limiting its pandemic potential. Importantly, in fatalities associated with avian influenza (H5N1), deaths occurred within 1 to 2 weeks, and were not complicated by simultaneous or subsequent bacterial CAPs.26, 27, 28, 29, 30\n",

When the pandemic returns and even larger numbers of the worldwide population will be affected, there will certainly be cases of H1N1 pneumonia with simultaneous or subsequent bacterial CAPs. During the \u201cherald wave\u201d of H1N1 pneumonia, our experience not incidence with early totalities was not unlike that with avian influenza (H5N1), in that most mortalities were related to the severe, prolonged hypoxemia of H1N1 pneumonia, and were not attributable to concurrent or subsequent bacterial CAPs.4, 7 We should expect some cases of bacterial CAP to occur as the pandemic progresses. If patients with H1N1 pneumonia present together with rapidly cavitating necrotic CAP, indicative of S. aureus (MSSA or CA-MRSA) pneumonia, then empiric antibiotic coverage should not be directed against the usual CAP pathogens. If H1N1 pneumonia presents together with MSSA/CA-MRSA pneumonia, then empiric therapy should be directed against S. aureus, e.g., linezolid and tigecycline rather than CAP regimens that exhibit no activity against these pathogens, i.e., ceftriaxone plus azithromycin. If patients with H1N1 pneumonia improve and later present with a bacterial CAP, then the usual CAP-recommended regimens should be sufficient, because S. aureus is not a pathogen with subsequent CAP.8, 9, 22, 23\n",

The swine influenza triad allows clinicians to make a rapid, clinical, presumptive diagnosis of H1N1 in hospitalized adults with ILIs and negative RIDTs. Hopefully, as the pandemic progresses, RT-PCR testing will be more widely available, and results reported more rapidly. The entry criteria for applying the swine influenza diagnostic triad include an admission CXR. The CXR is of critical importance, not only in ruling out other conditions, but also in diagnosing mimics of H1N1 pneumonia, e.g., legionnaire's disease. The CXR is also of critical importance in H1N1 pneumonia to identify patients with superimposed S. aureus methicillin-sensitive S. aureus/Community-Associated Methicillin-Resistant S.
