Swelling of tissues, dropsy, red sores, necrosis, ulceration, and hemorrhagic septicemia are typical symptoms of MAS [3], [4]. Many fish species can be affected by MAS, including tilapia [5], [6], catfish [7], [8], goldfish [9], [10], common carp [11], [12], and eel [13]. As an opportunistic pathogen, A. hydrophila caused outbreaks in fish farms with high mortality rates [14], [15], [16]. In West Alabama, MAS disease outbreak caused by A. hydrophila in 2009 alone has led to an estimated loss of more than 3 million pounds of food size channel catfish [17]. Virulence studies have revealed that AL09-71, a 2009 West Alabama isolate of A. hydrophila used in this study, is highly virulent to channel catfish, killing fish within 24 h post exposure [18].",

Immunity of fish to bacterial infections is largely mediated by cellular immune responses with humoral antibodies having a secondary role [20], [21]. It was reported that live attenuated A. hydrophila induced the up-regulation of multiple immune genes in channel catfish [22]. In addition, infection with A. hydrophila induced peak up-regulation of several genes at 6 h post injection (hpi) [22]. However, it was unknown whether gene expression levels in channel catfish after re-infection with A. hydrophila were induced higher compared to that by the first infection. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to: 1) identify up-regulated genes in channel catfish after a second infection of A. hydrophila compared to a single infection at 6 hpi by suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH); 2) compare the gene expression patterns of at different time (0, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hpi) after the first infection and the re-infection to determine the peak response time; and 3) screen genes that were reported in literature and identify genes up-regulated by the first infection and the re-infection at the peak response time.",

Two-step subtractive hybridizations were performed according to procedures described previously [22]. Briefly, two primary hybridization reactions (A and B) were formed by adding excess amounts of first infection cDNA (driver) to second infection cDNA (tester) samples at a 50:1 ratio. The samples were denatured for 2 min at 98 \u00b0C and allowed to anneal for 8 h at 68 \u00b0C. The remaining single-stranded, adaptor-ligated tester cDNAs were substantially enriched in each hybridization reaction for over-expressed sequences because non-target cDNAs present in the tester and driver could form hybrids. After filling in the adapter ends with DNA polymerase, over-expressed sequences (tester cDNA) had different annealing sites on their 3\u2032- and 5\u2032- ends. The molecules were then subjected to suppression subtraction PCR. The PCR products were then cloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI).

The fluorescence intensities of the control and treatment products for each gene, as measured by cycle threshold (C\nt) values, were compared and converted to fold differences by the relative quantification method [23] using the Relative Expression Software Tool 384 v. 1 (REST) and assuming 100% efficiencies. Expression differences between control and treatment groups were assessed for statistical significance using a randomization test in the REST software. The mRNA expression levels of all samples were normalized to the levels of 18S ribosomal RNA gene in the same sample. Expression levels of 18S were constant between all samples (<0.30 change in C\nt). Each primer set amplified a single product as indicated by a single peak present for each gene during melting curve analysis. The relative transcriptional levels of different genes were determined by subtracting the cycle threshold (C\nt) of the sample by that of the 18S rRNA, the calibrator or internal control, as per the formula: \u0394C\nt = C\nt (sample) \u2212 C\nt (calibrator). The relative expression level of a specific gene at different time points were compared to that of fish at time 0 using formula 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct where \u0394\u0394C\nt = \u0394C\nt (time point x) \u2212 \u0394C\nt (time point 0) as described previously [22].",

At 12 and 24 hpi, TLR2 was significantly (P < 0.05) more induced by the first infection compared to that by the second infection (Fig. 3A). Similar pattern was also observed for TLR3 (Fig. 3B) and TLR21 (Fig. 3D). However, the expression pattern of TLR5 (Fig. 3C) after the first infection of A. hydrophila was not statistically different from that after the second infection. The significantly (P < 0.05) higher expression level of TLR5 in fish injected with A. hydrophila compared to that with TSB peaked at 3 hpi (Fig. 3C).",

Of the eight ESTs, two Xba elements (XbaI element 5 and XbaI element 7) were up-regulated greater than 6-fold by the second infection. In channel catfish, Xba elements were A/T-rich tandem repetitive non-coding sequences [31]. Non-coding RNA sequences play important roles in regulating transcription of protein-coding genes [32], including immunity-related genes [33]. Transcriptome analysis of the host response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection across four founder mouse strains has revealed differential expression of 500 ncRNAs during infection [34], indicating that differential expression of ncRNAs is widespread in response to infection. Taken together, these results suggest that the overexpression of ncRNAs such as XbaI elements might play important roles in immunity.",

Therefore, 3 hpi was chosen to screen the 96 selected genes. Of the 96 genes selected from literature, 19 were found to be significantly induced by A. hydrophila at 3 hpi compared to that by TSB, regardless the infection time (first infection or second infection). The fact that SSH failed to identify these genes could be due to the following reasons. Firstly, we used cDNAs from the second infection as tester in an attempt to identify genes that are more up-regulated in adaptive response, which might have contributed to the failed discovery of other genes. Secondary, we chose 6 hpi instead of 3 hpi as the time point for SSH which might have contributed to the failed discovery of the known immunity-related genes identified by the screen. Nonetheless, SSH identified differentially expressed genes that were previously reported to be up-regulated by bacteria infections, including TLR20 and NADH dehydrogenase, both of which were reported to be up-regulated in channel catfish by Edwardsiella icatluri infection [24], [26]. In addition, SSH also identified genes that were previously not reported to be induced by infection in channel catfish, such as XbaI elements, prolactin, and inward rectifier potassium channel. Prolactin, a peptide hormone that shares many properties with cytokines [35], plays an important role in immunity by inducing the expression of the genes encoding the major phagocyte NADPH oxidase components and ROS production in fish macrophages via the JAK2/Stat/IRF-1 signaling pathway [36], [37]. Macrophages have two types of potassium channels: inwardly rectifying potassium channel and voltage-gated potassium channel [38], [39]. Potassium channel activity is required for the induction of nitric oxide and respiratory burst response in activated macrophages in goldfish (Carassius auratus) [40].",

Expression kinetics study revealed that the expression pattern of TLR2, TLR3, or TLR21 after the second infection was different from that after the firs infection. However, TLR5 exhibited similar expression patterns after the first and the second infections, with significant peaked up-regulation at 3 hpi. TLRs are evolutionarily conserved receptors that function in innate immunity through recognition of the conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of an invading pathogen and eliciting inflammatory and immune responses [41]. The best characterized ligand that TLRs recognize include: (1) lipoproteins by TLR2; (2) dsRNA by TLR3; (3) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by TLR4; and (4) bacterial flagellins by TLR5 [42]. The recognition of PAMPs by TLRs will trigger an intracellular signaling cascade which activates signaling molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, interferons (IFNs), and co-stimulatory molecules that aid in the development of the immune response [43]. In addition to significant up-regulation of TLR5 at 3 hpi, four signaling proteins were also found to be significantly up-regulated at 3 hpi after the first infection or the second infection, including cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptor 1, very large inducible GTPase 1, arginine deiminase, and lymphokine-activated killer T-cell originated protein kinase. At 3 hpi, the expression of the four cytokine or chemokine also peaked, although the expression of IL-1\u03b2 and chemokine CXCL-10 after the first infection were the highest.",

At 6 hpi, the expression levels of transferrin and IL-1\u03b2 were the highest. At 12 hpi, the expression levels of IL-10 and chemokine CXCL-10 were the highest. At 24 hpi, the expression levels of XbaI element 5 and XbaI element 7 were the highest. At 48 hpi, transferrin had the highest expression. IL-1\u03b2 is an important early response pro-inflammatory cytokine that mediates immune regulation in both innate and adaptive immunity [44]. When IL-1\u03b2 was over-expressed in common carp (Cyprinus carpio), the macrophage functions such as production of superoxide anion and phagocytosis were significantly stimulated [45]. IL-10 is reported to be an anti-inflammatory cytokine that plays a crucial role in the regulation of inflammation by down-regulating expression of other cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 [46]. In consistent with previous report, we also observed the lowest expression level (<10 fold) of IL-1\u03b2 at 12 hpi when IL-10 was expressed the highest (\u223c60 fold). Significant up-regulation of hepcidin and transferrin has been reported in channel catfish after infection with E. ictaluri or A. hydrophila\n[22], [30]. In consistent with previous reports, this study also revealed that hepcidin and transferrin were induced by infection with A. hydrophila. Taken together, these results suggest that transcriptional regulation of immune genes plays and important role in the immunity of channel catfish against bacterial infections.",

Taken together, these results suggest that adaptive immunity might play an important role in the defense against the re-infection. Significantly higher bactericidal activity of serum samples at 28 days post infection with A. hydrophila was observed in this study when compared to that of fish serum treated only with TSB. In addition, peaked expression and activity of lysozyme after the first infection was at 24 hpi, whereas that after the second infection was at 12 hpi, further suggesting that adaptive immunity in fish must have developed, therefore enabling faster production of lysozyme c to kill the bacteria.",
