In these contexts, real time operation, mobility, location awareness and smart data fusion from different sensors (environment, location, bio sensors...) are actually a matter. Such systems prove to be effective when diagnosing virus infections in an initial state so that proper treatment can be given on time to enable fast recovery. An interesting case is presented in [55] where a solution to diagnose and prevent the outbreak of Chikungunya is discussed. A fog-based system analyzes user\u2019s health symptoms and surrounding environmental conditions for diagnosing the presence of the virus; it\u2019s also able to send alert messages to make users aware of infected and risk-prone areas. [54] also propose a system to prevent and control the spread of Zika virus disease by implementing a MCC paradigm; the goal is to diagnose the possibly infected users and represent them together with mosquito-dense sites and breeding sites on the Google map to help the government healthcare authorities to control risk-prone areas. In both cases, a fog layer is used for processing and a preliminary analysis while cloud services are used for storage, deep analysis and remote access. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has raised a dramatic need for rapid screening tools to evaluate, in contactless conditions (at least 1 m away), the presence of the main symptoms of infection (fever, cyanosis, tiredness...), so that some IoT prototypes, based on low cost hardware, are beginning to appear. For instance, the AutoTriage system, presented in [27], is able to run in real-time DL algorithms at the edge level to detect forehead and lip regions, allowing to estimate the temperature of the forehead-eye area by an infrared camera, while cyanosis is assessed from lips region in the visible spectrum. In a similar way, [35] propose a design study for predicting COVID-19 disease by applying multimodal AI approaches on smartphone embedded sensors readings. The possibility to share information about the location allows smart IoT devices to maximize the safety of their human owners. [12] discuss a trust-based approach for information sharing in a IoMT framework where data from sensors are used to derive a health loss risk for a user entering a given location at a given time, according to her vulnerabilities.

For example, [7] discuss a novel technique to predict type-2 diabetes risks, while [19] use a J48Graft decision tree classifier, implemented on a smartphone, to discover the risk level of diabetic patients. Finally, a deep learning model to predict diabetes, stress types and hypertension attacks from wearable sensor data is discussed in [49], where a fog architecture is also proposed.",

            "text": "In the previous section, we have provided an overview of the most relevant IoT applications and solutions in literature that use a combination of edge, fog and cloud computing for addressing health care problems. The aforementioned studies have confirmed that a wide range of AI and ML based approaches can be effectively adopted for decision making, anomaly detection, predictive risk monitoring, treatment support and so on. Most cases still offload deep analysis tasks to the cloud, due to limited resources on edge low power devices, but an increasing trend towards solutions implementing a functional cooperation between edge, fog and cloud services can be actually observed. Many applications using ML/DL techniques such as multimodal activity prediction or recognition, pre-incident monitoring (fall detection and prevention), disease treatment (medical automation) and emergency care require the inference to be performed as close as possible to the sensor nodes to reduce latency, meet the requirement of realtime operation and minimize energy consumption. In static monitoring, fog architectures with GPU enhanced local servers seem to be the most adopted solution for addressing high demanding ML inference tasks. In dynamic monitoring problems, where a small sized low power computing node is employed, other optimization strategies come into play. On one hand, edge stream-computing techniques that aim at parallelizing the inference process between different edge peers can be a concrete answer; on the other, the adoption of DL lightweight models, optimized for running inference on embedded devices, allows to achieve very interesting results. In this context, the advent of deep learning mobile frameworks has been accompanied by the proliferation of studies about strategies and techniques to transform and adapt DL models for running in constrained resource conditions. Such transformations range from model compression and quantization up to approximation and pruning aimed at obtaining networks with a very small footprint without penalizing performance. A different matter concerns on-line or active learning systems, where training performed at the edge level could suffer from:\u2022\nbiased training samples - performing at a local level, the edge device is able to capture polarized samples (about the same user or case) that can lead to overfitting when updating/re-training the model;\u2022\nunsufficient computational power - re-training can be computationally very expensive also if compressed/lightweight models are employed. This often leads to offloading the retraining stage to the cloud.\n",

            "text": "To address such issues, a number of interesting works discussing the suitability of AI methods for the IoT concept are being proposed [37]. Leveraging early studies about distributed deep networks training [18], some proposals investigate P2P approaches as in [15], where the authors discuss a distributed learning system with each edge node implementing a common neural network and exchanging weights with other peer nodes. On the same line, distributed approaches to deep networks training and collaborative machine learning at the edge level are also widely discussed by [46], where both theoretical and technical enablers for decentralized edge training are investigated. In addition to other features, these approaches can be beneficial for facing the problems deriving from changes in data distribution over time that, particularly in health applications, could negatively affect the performance of the whole system. Covariate shift, for example, can be efficiently faced when segmentation of deep networks on the edge [62] is introduced. In this case, in fact, only the device containing the first layers of the network has to be modified in order to correct the shift. We strongly expect these findings about edge ML to flourish in health care applications within the next few years, triggering further investigations in different settings.",

            "text": "IoT solutions for healthcare are evolving from simple architectures to collect, transmit and visualize data acquired by field and wearable sensor networks towards complex smart systems able to provide analytics, recognize activities and making decisions. In this transition, AI and machine learning techniques play an important role but their implementation require computational capacity that is often available only by means of cloud services. Actually, with the exponential growth of the data produced by the sensors, a cloud centric vision of the ML processing presents several weaknesses for different reasons. The quality of the service is strongly influenced by the quality of the internet connection, which also poses an availability problem. In particular, where a real time performance must be ensured, as in early-detection, risk prevention or activity recognition, the response time must be low to allow healthcare providers to proactively react to possible degradation of health conditions. Data storage and security are also critical issues when dealing with health related services, due to the large amount of personal data to be managed. After all, the choice of a fully local management is still impracticable due to limitations in processing power and storage, especially in the case of dynamic monitoring. Some proposals that try to map a proper computing model to the IoT tiers are being introduced to meet the requirements of IoMT systems. They aim at distributing the DL workload between the cloud and fog nodes, often relegating the model training to the cloud and moving the decision making to the edge. The interest towards these approaches is well motivated by the diffusion of compact GPU embedded hardware which allows the deployment of powerful and effective fog nodes. In cases where the DL training phase is still computationally unmanageable by the fog/edge node, DNN partitioning and distributed training represents a promising trend at present.",
