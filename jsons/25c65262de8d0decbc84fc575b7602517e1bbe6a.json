Firstly, if frailty states in COVID-19 are not associated with mortality, then this has only limited value as a consideration in older people who may require ventilatory support. This is in contrast to the central NICE guidance that recommends a frailty assessment as the first step in the assessment for critical care.",

In general, the pathophysiology described in COVID-19 patients in critical care indicates substantial immune hyperactivation [14] . However, given survival in the CFS range 7-9 was similar in cases and controls, this may reflect death from COVID-19 is occurring in the same way as for other common illness and immune hyperactivation is unlikely to be a significant feature in this group. One might speculate that older people with frailty have pre-existing immunesenescence such that they are unable to mount excess immune responses and may be otherwise by dying from the direct effects of viral infection.",

In the multivariable model, these relationships remained consistent: age (HR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.07, p<0.01), South Asian ethnicity (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.13 to 3.51, p=0.02) (Table 2).The different associations with frailty according to COVID-19 status was confirmed by demonstrating an interaction term (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.71, p<0.01). The coefficient direction suggests that mortality is proportionally higher in fitter patients. Estimated in this way, the overall mortality attributable to COVID-19 was extremely high in this population (HR 213, 95% CI 24.6 to 1841, p<0.01).
