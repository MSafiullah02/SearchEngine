In epithelial cells, viral proteins, which utilize the cell\u2019s metabolic machinery, have provided efficient tools as markers for intracellular protein transport because they can be distinguished from the cell\u2019s endogenous proteins and, therefore, permit the tracing of a protein from its site of origin to its destination. Certain proteins of enveloped ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses are targeted to the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells, while others to the basolateral domain. Such a selective viral protein distribution enables the study of protein sorting mechanisms 20, 38.",

For these purposes, viruses that bud at the plasma membrane have commonly been used as reporters, but viruses that assemble on intracellular membranes are given increased interest [19]. In a series of studies using rotavirus, which assemble in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), we have made the interesting observation that two viral proteins, which both are retained in the ER [28], show differences in their distribution in neurons. The nonstructural protein NSP4 remains in the cell body while the outer capsid protein VP7 appears also in axons. Although VP7 is a luminal ER-associated glycoprotein, its axonal transport could not be inhibited with brefeldin A [50], which is a drug that disrupts the organization of the Golgi apparatus [7], indicating that it can bypass the Golgi apparatus to reach the axons. The present study was undertaken with a view to compare the appearance of these newly formed viral proteins with the distribution of endogenous ER-retained proteins in neurons.",

In the present study we compare the distribution in neurons of different ER-retained proteins, which contain the KDEL sequence, with proteins that lack this sequence. The former included the luminal chaperones immunoglobulin heavy chains binding protein (BiP) 1, 10, 11, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) [11]and calreticulin, which also is a major Ca2+-binding protein in nonmuscle cells 29, 30, 42.

One type was characterized by the presence of DRG neurons attached to a collagen matrix and maintained in media complemented with sera. The neurons were well preserved for long periods of time and were used after 12\u201314 days in culture. However, in spite of the use of antimitotic agents, non-neuronal cells tended to overgrow the neurons and their processes. In the other type of the DRG culture, the cells were seeded on the Matrigel substrate, which although effective in promoting the outgrowth of neuronal processes, could only maintain the cultures for a limited period of time. These cultures were maintained in serum-free medium, which diminished significantly the presence of nonneuronal cells and this allowed clear observations on axons. Such cultures were used for infection after 2 days in culture. In both types of cultures, the DRG neurons were characterized by the presence of well developed axons, which often formed thick bundles projecting from the cell bodies. The axonal processes were labeled with the antibody to tau (Fig. 1A), while immunolabeling with the MAP2 antibody was confined to the cell bodies in both types of cultures (Fig. 1B and C). After infection with rotavirus, the distribution of these microtubule-associated proteins was maintained. The rotavirus VP7 glycoprotein appeared in both cell bodies and axons (Fig. 1D), but the NSP4 protein was restricted to the cell bodies even at 48 h after infection (Fig. 1E and F).\n",

The dendrites were prominent and could be identified by their tapering and branching at acute angles.

The axons were thin and, due to the overgrowth by glial cells, they were much more difficult to distinguish than the thick and prominent dendrites. In rotavirus-infected neurons, VP7-immunopositive material was seen as distinct and relatively large granules in the perikarya and far out into both dendrites (beyond the third division) and axons (Fig. 3A; Fig. 4C and D). The granules accumulated in larger groups at dendritic branching sites. The NSP4 immunolabeling was found in granules localized to both the cell body and dendrites, where they also extended beyond the third division (Fig. 3B), but it could not be detected in axon-like structures. Calreticulin immunopositivity extended equally far into dendrites and into axons (Fig. 3C), while that of the other proteins (BiP and PDI) and the peptide containing the KDEL sequence was restricted to the cell bodies and proximal parts of the dendrites.

            "text": "The two ER-retained proteins BiP and PDI are soluble and serve the function of chaperones in protein folding [11]. Although originally described as restricted to the rough ER, both proteins seem to be located in the lumen of the entire ER and have, therefore, been considered to be general markers for the ER [41]. As shown previously and in the present study, both proteins were present in neurons. Villa et al. 52, 53reported that BiP immunoreactivity extended from the cell bodies to the dendritic spines of rat Purkinje cells in vivo and at the ultrastructural level the molecule was detected even in axons within the cerebellar cortex. In cultured hippocampal neurons, Krijnse-Locker et al. [22]also observed that some BiP and PDI-immunopositive granules occurred in thin axon-like structures, while the receptor for the KDEL sequence was almost limited to cell bodies. This contrasts the present observation in which these two molecules, as well as the KDEL-peptide sequence, did not seem to enter the axons of the DRG neurons, but extended into dendrites of the hippocampal neurons. However, another soluble luminal ER-protein, calreticulin, appeared in axons of the DRG in spite of the fact that this protein also contains a KDEL sequence. Calreticulin is a major calcium-binding protein in nonmuscle cells 29, 30, 42. The protein is galactosylated, which indicates that it must have passed through the trans Golgi cisterns, where galactosylation occurs, before being retrieved back to the ER [34]. It has been postulated that different ER-proteins can escape into different post-ER compartments and that ER-retained proteins can, therefore, be progressively retrieved from a series of positions along the secretory pathways 16, 24. Besides calcium-binding effects, calreticulin also serves the function of a chaperone in the ER, where it acts in concert with the transmembrane ER-protein calnexin in the control of folding of glycoproteins 3, 13. The cytoplasmic tail of calnexin carries a RKPRRE sequence that serves as a signal to localize this protein to the ER. In the present study these two chaperones co-localized not only in the somatodendritic domains but also in axons, which corroborates previous observations on the distribution of these proteins in rat and monkey cerebellar neurons 17, 53.",

            "text": "The intermediate compartment is an extensive structure of a complex tubulo-vesicular organization that transfers molecules from the ER to the Golgi apparatus 32, 33. Proteins in this compartment may occupy different subregions [21]. Viral proteins have served as markers for protein transport through the intermediate compartment vesicles and certain viruses can also assemble and mature at this site. For instance, the hepatitis B virus surface antigen co-localizes with rab2 [15]and vesicular stomatitis virus G protein with rab2 and p58 26, 36. A coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus, buds into intermediate compartment vesicles containing rab2 and p58, but also into PDI-containing structures [21], and the vesicles that enwrap and ultimately form double envelopes around intracellular vaccinia virus particles may represent intermediate compartment vesicles 31, 43. In the present study the endogenous intermediate compartment protein ERGIC-53 was confined to the cell bodies and dendrites, while rab2 was found in both dendrites and axons. The latter observation is in contrast to the study on hippocampal neurons by Krijnse-Locker et al. [22], in which rab2 could not be detected in axons. In the DRG axons, the small rab2 vesicles did not colocalize with the VP7 protein, which indicates that also in axons the intermediate compartment vesicles are distinct from the ER. Rab2 belongs to the family of GTP-binding proteins, which use GTP hydrolysis to catalyze the association of recognition molecules in the docking of vesicles and target membranes in a cell 35, 46. Rab2 is considered to be involved in the traffic between ER and cis Golgi cisterns and its appearance in axons, in which Golgi apparatus is lacking, is unexpected. In cultured rat embryonic neurons, obtained from tectum and ventral midbrain, injection of purified rab2 protein caused an enhanced adhesion of the cells and an increased outgrowth of dendrite-like neurites. It was suggested that the protein may be involved in the transport and fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane at the level of the growth cones [2].",

The two rotavirus proteins, VP7 and NSP4, which both lack a KDEL sequence, showed marked differences in their distribution. The NSP4 protein had a polarized distribution and appeared in the somatodendritic domain of the neurons, while the VP7 protein also occurred in axons. The NSP4 protein seemed to be distinct in its distribution from the other ER-associated proteins. It did not enter axons but extended into dendrites beyond the level of BiP and PDI. NSP4 is a nonstructural transmembrane rough ER viral protein. It has been suggested to serve as a receptor for subviral particles in the cytosol to mediate their budding through the ER membrane in the process of virus morphogenesis [9]. The motif for retaining the high mannose containing NSP4 to the rough ER has not been identified. In addition to its role as a receptor, NSP4 has been suggested to regulate the intracellular calcium levels of infected cells. This may promote the acquisition of correct protein configuration during virus maturation, but may also be involved in the cytotoxicity [45].",

Previously, we have observed that VP7 does not pass through the Golgi apparatus on its way to axons [50]. The mechanisms by which the endo-H sensitive VP7 is retained in the ER remains an interesting question in cell biology since it does not contain a KDEL or RKPRRE sequence and it is not membrane spanning. Although the localization of VP7 and calreticulin to axonal ER-like structures may be similar, their routes to reach this compartment may differ; calreticulin being transferred through the Golgi apparatus to become galactosylated and VP7 being directly transferred. Anatomically, a direct communication between the rough ER of the nerve cell bodies and the smooth ER of the axons has repeatedly been proposed 4, 14, 25, 37and VP7 may, therefore, be a reporter to study this route of delivery of molecules to axons. Recently, a nonclassical pathway for vesicular transport to the apical cell surface that bypasses the Golgi apparatus has been detected also in epithelial cells by the use of rotavirus [18].",
