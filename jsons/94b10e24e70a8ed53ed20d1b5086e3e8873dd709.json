By the mid-1970s, China was already undergoing the epidemiologic transition, years ahead of other nations of similar economic status, and by 1980, life expectancy (67 years) exceeded that of most similarly low-income nations by 7 years. Almost 30 years later, China's 2009 health reforms were a response to deep inequity in access to affordable, quality healthcare resulting from three decades of marketization, including de facto privatization of the health sector, along with decentralized accountability and, to a large degree, financing of public health services. The reforms are built on earlier, equity-enhancing initiatives, particularly the reintroduction of social health insurance since 2003, and are planned to continue until 2020, with gradual achievement of overarching objectives on universal and equitable access to health services. The second phase of reform commenced in early 2012. China's health reforms remain encouragingly specific but not prescriptive on strategy; set in the decentralized governance structure, they avoid the issue of reliance on local government support for the national equity objective, leaving the detailed design of health service financing, human resource distribution and accountability, essential drug lists and application of clinical care pathways, etc. to local health authorities answerable to local government, not the Ministry of Health. Community engagement in government processes, including in provision of healthcare, remains limited. This chapter uses the documentation and literature on health reform in China to provide a comprehensive overview of the current situation of the health sector and its reform in the People's Republic.

In land area, China is the world's third largest nation, theoretically spanning 4 h of time difference from west to east (while officially operating on one time zone). Its 2010 census revealed a population approaching 1.34 billion, the world's largest. China's population grew most rapidly from the late 1950s to the early 1970s, due to the formerly high fecundity of its women alongside a rapid fall in the crude death rate due to communicable disease control (CDC) and basic public health measures. Life expectancy also rose rapidly during this period ( Fig. 1 ) (Hipgrave 2011a ). The second familiar aspect is China's meteoric economic development, with an average annual growth rate of around 10% for most of the last 30 years, only falling to 7-8% since the global financial crisis.",

China will soon become the first large nation to age before achieving developed nation status. Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) now account for over 80% of deaths in China and almost 70% of its total disease burden (The World Bank Human Development Unit 2011). A World Bank analysis of NCDs in China (The World Bank Human Development Unit 2011) concluded that \"a reduced ratio of healthy workers to sicker, older dependents will certainly increase the odds of a future economic slowdown and pose a significant social challenge in China\" (page 2). Equally challenging is the provision of new services for the prevention and management of chronic illness and the government's averred commitment to equity and universal health coverage. These challenges and commitments were among the stimuli to the major health system reform (HSR) that China commenced in 2009 (State Council 2009).",

It again commits to expanding insurance benefits and introduces priority to unifying China's several health insurance schemes; it encourages development of commercial insurance and the introduction of capitation and other payment reforms to separate doctors from the financial management of hospitals; it suggests that the private sector should manage 20% of health services by 2015; family general practice is promoted alongside expanding community and public health services, and the drug production, prescription, and pricing will be further consolidated and regulated; performancebased funding of health staff is also mentioned.

Another major problem remains the difficulty of reforming hospital management, effectively undoing the private, for-profit system that evolved over recent decades.

In the past, when the health sector was of low priority, this severely limited the implementation of national laws relevant to the health sector. For example, the 1989 Law on Control of Infectious Diseases conferred on local government's responsibility for various forms of reporting and action, but was weakly implemented, culminating in the wake-up call of SARS in 2003, redrafting of the law and major reform of CDC (Hipgrave 2011a; Wang et al. 2008a) . Initiatives depending on countrywide uptake such as the 2010 national measles vaccination campaign still rely heavily on local funding and prioritization; recent environmental degradation and food and drug safety scandals are further evidence of the lack of cross-sectoral priority given to the health sector in China. The partial rollback of the one-child policy announced at national level in 2013 remains subject to interpretation and optional implementation by provincial governments. Despite its evident high priority (Tang et al. 2014a ), many aspects of the HSR itself are dependent on the same support and follow-up by provincial and even county governments Brixi et al. 2012) .",

In some provinces, a few key HSR targets such as health insurance coverage were incorporated into subnational officials' performance evaluation criteria, which has been effective in ensuring progress. However, in other, more complicated reform areas, such as strengthening primary healthcare, public hospital reforms, and others, ensuring progress has been more difficult. Indeed, the reform of public hospitals suffers from a lack of consensus or clear national guidance on direction, limiting its prioritization and implementation outside pilot areas, particularly at low levels.

Moreover, while banking, communications, etc. are carefully regulated and monitored from above, like most social sectors, health services are largely organized and monitored at the local level. It is too costly for China's undermanned central government to independently monitor and evaluate subnational health performance (Wong 2010; Zhou 2010b) . These circumstances explain the limited ability of national health officials to ensure the HSR is fully pursued at grassroots level.",

However, many Congress members are unelected (in the western democratic sense) appointees, and the People's Congress generally rubber-stamps the documents presented. However, with the increasing attention of the Party and government in China to public comment through social media, albeit increasingly censored (Osnos 2014) , and local protests, there is growing acknowledgment of their answerability to the general public. Therefore, while during local planning there is almost no formal process for the public to make input, there are opportunities for the general population to voice concerns through the courts, social media, petitions, protests, etc., especially when issues affect a significant proportion of a community. Although the process is usually slow (the HSR took many years to be formalized (Tang et al. 2014a )), there is usually gradual recognition and acknowledgment of the need to act. On the other hand, implementation of plans usually requires higher-level pressure on the various lower tiers of government, and this pressure progressively dissipates further down the hierarchy; it may be ignored for issues that don't have high-level and cross-sectoral support and the support of local government. Hence, targets for insurance coverage and drug price control are accepted, but controlling the environmental impact of local industry is often ignored (Human Rights Watch 2011). In this process, public influence is rather indirect and can be ignored if local economic, political, or vested interests override it.",

There is no ombudsman or independent regulator in China's health system, and senior appointments are normally approved by the ruling Party organization. However, since launching the HSR, government is learning that empowering patients and regularly collecting their feedback on key parameters such as service prices and quality strengthens accountability across the government levels and can help achieve the overall goals of the reform (State Council 2014).

With major events as the HSR, new changes and innovations are often seen in the plans year on year. At subnational levels, healthrelated authorities (not only health bureaux) in provinces, prefectures, and counties submit annual planning and budget proposals in line with health service delivery needs and stewardship to the development planning and finance authorities at the corresponding tier. Implementation is financed by local budget supplemented by transfers from higher tiers of government (explained below). Local data should be used in formulating plans, but as there is little tradition of regular, independent, or audited data gathering in China, desensitization of administrative and economic data is suspected (Cai 2008; Hu et al. 2011; Walter and Howie 2011; Kaiman 2013; Anonymous 2012) .",

China does not have a tradition of locally representative, populationbased surveys on health outcomes; those which are undertaken are almost never independent. The disaggregated impact of health initiatives and local health status remains unknown except at crude (regional and urban-rural) levels (Meng et al. 2012 ; Ministry of Health Centre for Health Statistics and Information 2009). This lack of data reduces the ability of governments to allocate resources according to local demography and disease epidemiology (which are changing rapidly with urbanization). In this context, quality implementation of new HMIS initiatives (Hipgrave 2011b) will be critical; however, again these are national initiatives reliant on local funding. The HMIS is mentioned as a priority for the second phase of the HSR (Ministry of Health 2012a), but in general the monitoring and evaluation of China's health sector remains weak and non-independent and is not prioritized at subnational level.",

Subsidies for these provinces impact the shape of the line of best fit in Fig. 2 , which depicts provincial expenditure on health in relation to provincial GDP, per capita. aligned with policy priorities across sectors and programs. There are four distinct components of the national budget system, two of which impact on social sector spending: the general government budget (which relies on various taxation revenues and allocates funds to publicly funded services and activities) and the social security budget. The first of these allocates funds at the sectoral level; line ministries can then decide on and allocate earmarked transfers to the provinces (Wong 2010; Zhou 2010b ).

For example, the number of hospital beds per 1000 population in 2011 was around 4, among the lowest in the world (Ministry of Health 2012b). Health infrastructure in China also suffered from a major urban-rural divide in the earlier stages of social and economic development. Not only did urban health infrastructure enjoy greater public financial support, it attracted loans and other financial instruments because it was profitable and boosted the local economy. For many years, rural facilities received very limited government subsidy and relied on collective funding among farmers. Rural health infrastructure lagged seriously, in terms of both the basic condition of health facilities (buildings, beds, etc.) and the equipment, while big urban hospitals acquired technical equipment of high quality. In 2005, there were 3.6 hospital beds per 1000 urban residents, but only 0.78 in rural townships (Ministry of Health 2007). This inequity was recognized by national government, and in 2006 the majority of a national bond issue was used to finance a project earmarked for rural health, specifically to finance the rebuilding, renovation, and updating of medical equipment for rural providers, including primary health facilities such as CDC and MCH institutions. The NDRC and its local branches approved the funding proposals for physical health infrastructure. More recently, the 2009 HSR allocated large sums to further improve physical health sector infrastructure (focusing on rural remote rural areas, but also urban community health centers). Progress on this aspect of the Reform has been very positive (Yip et al. 2012 ).",

One of the main objectives of China's HSR is to regulate the remuneration of doctors and to separate their income from choices on clinical care. However, while China has reduced the level of out-ofpocket expenditure on health to around 35% through increases in public funding and insurance initiatives (Yip et al. 2012) , household health expenditure has not decreased either numerically or as a proportion of total household expenditure (Meng et al. 2012) . Although there is indirect evidence of increased non-health expenditure by insured households in comparison to before the schemes were introduced (Bai and Wu 2014), this objective of the HSR is proving to be the most difficult to achieve. China's THE is increasing at around 17% per year, and a large proportion of the increase is due to payment of health facilities, doctors, and other providers by individuals or insurers. As patient expectations rise but out-ofpocket expenses remain numerically high, an increasing number of assaults of doctors by patients' families are being reported. On the other hand, the scheduled fees payable to doctors for listed services are set below cost, forcing clinicians and facilities to charge for other services, investigations, procedures, and drugs (including those not on the essential drugs list with unregulated prices) (Blumenthal and Hsiao 2005; Ho and Gostin 2009; Wang et al. 2007; Tian et al. 2008) or through accepting bribes and kickbacks (Yang and Fan 2012) . While the government has committed to improving both the quality of care provided by health providers, and is exploring remunerating them through capitation, diagnostic-related groups and performance-based incentives (Ministry of Health 2012a), separating hospital management from doctors' income is proving to be the most difficult element of the current HSR (Yip et al. 2012 ).",

In 2008, 42.7% of China's THE was on drugs (Hu 2010 ), compared to 17% in developed nations (Seiter et al. 2010) . Excessive drug prescription was common in rural China (Zhan et al. 1998; Pavin et al. 2003; Dong et al. 2008; Chen et al. 2010; Yu et al. 2010) , and there is evidence that China's rural health insurance scheme was encouraging overprescription (Chen et al. 2010; Sun et al. 2009 ). Drug sales continue to provide the largest income source for China's county health facilities; doctors have a pecuniary incentive to prescribe more and more expensive drugs (Chen et al. 2010; Yu et al. 2010) . Hospitals and doctors profit significantly from the sale of drugs (Yu et al. 2010 ; The World Bank Group East Asia Pacific Region 2010), affecting financial access to healthcare Meng et al. 2012) . Weak regulation of drug manufacture and distribution raises safety concerns (Yu et al. 2010; Guan et al. 2011) . Previous efforts to improve the pharmaceutical sector had limited effect. The impact of laws, decrees, and 24 separate price reductions over 1996-2007 was constrained by hospital financing/income generation, market influences, and patient preferences (Chen et al. 2010; Yu et al. 2010) . Price controls were undermined by manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers and by hospitals and physicians controlling the prescription of price-controlled drugs (Hu 2010; Yu et al. 2010; Chen and Schweitzer 2008) . New drug approvals were issued at astonishing rates (Ho and Gostin 2009) and the former head of the national drug administration authority was executed in 2007 for accepting bribes. Kickbacks and corruption continue to mar the sector (Yip et al. 2012; Yang and Fan 2012) .",

The Scheme covers drug production, pricing, distribution, procurement, prescribing, and payment (Hu 2010 ) and a new National Essential Drugs List (NEDL) for primary healthcare institutions. The 2012 NEDL comprises 317 western drugs and 203 TCM commodities (increased from 205 western and 102 in 2009) for storage and use by grassroots facilities. Bidding prices for 296 NEDL drugs were capped (Schatz and Nowlin 2010) , and a \"zero markup\" (no profit) policy was introduced, although markups remain allowed at county-level and higher facilities. By late January 2012, 99.8% of township hospitals and 58.1% of village clinics had implemented the policy (Ministry of Health 2012d). In addition, most (urban) districts and (rural) counties had made NEDL medicines reimbursable by the various health insurance schemes, with higher reimbursement rates than for nonessential medicines (Ministry of Health 2011c). Finally, to regulate the pharmaceutical market and distribution of essential drugs, the NEMS introduced province-wise, collective, internet-based public bidding and procurement for NEDL medicines.",

However, the official HSR documents encourage local adaptation of the broad design (Ho 2010) , including the NEDL (which has indeed been widely augmented (Guan et al. 2011; Shi et al. 2011) ) and strategies to compensate providers for the zero markup policy. Few evaluations of the impact of the Scheme have emerged. Very early indications suggested little change in prescribing practices (Yip et al. 2012) , but a small field evaluation found that while drug procurement has been systematized and the cost of care had declined coincident with reduced drug prices, manufacturers have not uniformly supported the changes, and some drug prices have actually increased. Provider compensation for reduced income was mostly ineffective, forcing some to seek alternative sources of income within and outside the health sector. Rational drug prescribing had improved in this study. The loss of drug income had forced health facilities to rely more on public financing, and providers complained of higher workload and lower incomes (Yang et al. 2013a) . Similar issues were found in another study in different locations (Xiao et al. 2013) .",

For example, in 2005, private hospitals accounted for only 17.2% of total hospitals, but the share had increased to 38.4% by 2011. In 2011 among all 954,389 health facilities (hospitals, clinics, and other institutions), 47% operated as \"private\" entities. Reports indicated that private health providers can offer services at a cheaper price and shorter physical distance and waiting time for patients (Deng et al. 2013) and are highly active in the provision of healthcare in China. However, most private facilities are small and poorly equipped, and collectively they only employed 17.5% of the total labor force, owned 9.7% of total medical beds, and received 9.1% of total patient hospital visits (Ministry of Health 2012b). Compared with public facilities, a large percentage of elderly physicians and new laborers in health market are practicing in private clinics (Tang et al. 2014b ). This staffing structure could have negative impact on quality of services.",

One major reason is that the evolution and current standing of national policy generally still favors public providers in terms of resource allocation, stewardship (entry and registration control), opportunities for promotion, and social insurance entitlements. This accounts for common challenges in the private sector, i.e., lack of technical capacity, poor infrastructure, and thus compromised service quality. Health authorities are now promoting a robust private sector to encourage competition and efficiency within the health sector, aiming for 20% of beds and services to be privately provided by 2015. However, subsidization of grassroots level public institutions may prevent moves in this direction.",

There are even suggestions that child mortality rates in China actually rose in the 1980s (Banister and Hill 2000) , with the breakup of the communebased health cooperatives. Moreover, improvement in certain indicators has been slow. For example, urban maternal mortality has been slow to fall, almost certainly because reductions in maternity risk for urban residents have been diluted by the much higher risk of death in pregnancy among urban migrants (Fig. 12) . Geographic disparities also remain great, particularly between eastern and western provinces . In general, the priority given to China's recent HSR acknowledges that progress in its population's health status was less than could have occurred, given the nation's economic growth since the 1980s (Yip et al. 2012) . Acknowledgement of this is the government target of a one-year increase in life expectancy by 2015 (Ministry of Health 2012a). The most comprehensive analysis of the causes of death and disability in China, published in mid-2013, highlighted the dramatic evolution of its demographic transition, with NCDs now making up all but two of the top 30 causes of lost life years, and most infectious diseases having fallen precipitously. The report also noted the contribution of air and household pollution to mortality and morbidity and the need for cross-sectoral action to tackle the major causes of ill-health in China (Yang et al. 2013b) .",
