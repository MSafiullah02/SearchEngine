There are several threats to transplantation but one particularly important threat is that of an emerging infectious disease. Since the 1980s, there have been several emerging viral diseases including HIV in the late 1980s/early 1990s, SARS\u2010CoV, West Nile Virus, pandemic influenza A/H1N1, Zika, Ebola, and now pandemic COVID\u201019 caused by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. For each of these threats, transplant programs have responded in a coordinated fashion by assessing the risk of donor transmission, assessing the severity of disease in the recipient, and recognizing the potential for transmission to health\u2010care workers.\n1\n, \n2\n, \n3\n, \n4\n, \n5\n This knowledge has then been used to generate algorithms for donor screening, not using organs from potentially infected donors, and recipient management. Many of these emerging viruses have been manageable, sometimes only limited to certain geographic areas, and transplantation/donation has been able to adapt and continue to provide this life\u2010saving therapy in a safe and effective manner. The current COVID\u201019 pandemic is unique and unprecedented in modern times. It has crossed borders and infected >180 000 persons worldwide that we know of, with likely many more undiagnosed cases. It has been difficult to contain partly due to the contagious nature of the virus and mild illness in a majority of individuals. Nevertheless, the emergence of COVID\u201019 has impacted transplantation worldwide. The impact has not been just restricted to issues around donors or recipients, but also health\u2010care resource utilization as the intensity of cases in certain jurisdictions exceeds available capacity. Based on our collective experience, we suggest mitigation strategies such as donor screening approaches, resource planning, and a staged approach to transplant volume considerations as local resource issues demand. We also discuss issues related to the management of immunosuppression trials during the pandemic, and the role of transplant infectious diseases and transplant societies for education and disseminating current information. We believe our collective experience will be valuable to the transplant community in the absence of hard published research findings this early in the pandemic.",

            "text": "There is a potential for COVID\u201019 to be transmitted by organ donation although the risk of this is unclear and we are not aware of any reports of transmission. The virus is primarily isolated from the respiratory tract suggesting the lung is a very high\u2010risk for transmission when used from an infected donor. However, virus is also been reported to be isolated from the blood in up to 15% of cases and therefore, all organs may be at risk of acquisition.\n6\n With the SARS epidemic of 2003, autopsy data demonstrated virus in almost all organs including the liver, kidney, and intestines.\n7\n Donor screening from both a clinical and laboratory perspective is therefore an important consideration and has been the subject of much discussion.\n8\n In areas with significant community transmission, if organ donation is to proceed in a safe manner, the authors recommend that both clinical and rapid laboratory screening is required. This approach to donation may differ in countries depending on the degree of community\u2010transmission of COVID\u201019. However, many areas have noted that due to limitations in test availability the true rate of community penetration may be unknown. During the SARS\u2010CoV outbreak of 2003 in Toronto, a clinical donor screening tool was instituted, incorporating epidemiological and clinical features of the donor, which then allowed deceased\u2010donor transplantation to continue.\n2\n However, unlike in 2003, there has been rapid development of nucleic acid testing (NAT) for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and therefore, testing of nasopharyngeal specimens has been incorporated and is the cornerstone of donor screening algorithms in several jurisdictions. Real\u2010time NP swab donor screening has been successfully deployed in organ procurement organizations (OPOs) within Canada, Italy, Spain, and South Korea. However, many questions remain, including the false negative rates of testing which can be due to inappropriate collection or a patient early in the incubation period. Since SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is known to use the ACE2 receptor for viral entry, a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimen may be more appropriate than naso/oropharyngeal swab. However, bronchoscopy would have the potential risk of aerosolization and may not be logistically feasible. For this approach to be successful, the test result must also be rapidly available. Laboratory\u2010developed or commercial NAT testing needs to be made available to OPOs with results in hours. Ruling out COVID\u201019 in a donor is also essential for the safety of organ procurement teams. Shortages of testing kits, reagents, and laboratory resources to carry out donor screening in the midst of a pandemic are also a major consideration.",

In the latter case, NAT testing would play a much larger role but the tool allows a second layer of redundancy in the screening process.

            "text": "In the face of a pandemic that may impact transplant recipients adversely, decisions to continue or cease transplantation need to be made by programs. Although donor transmission is an ominous possibility, many of these decisions are actually independent of donor transmission and have to do with the following considerations: (1) introducing immunosuppression into patients in the midst of a pandemic, (2) the risk vs benefit ratio of postponing transplant vs proceeding, and (3) rationing of healthcare resources including both inpatient and outpatient resources. Lack of ventilator capacity is also an extremely important consideration once widespread activity is present. For example, kidney transplantation reduces the morbidity of dialysis and is cost\u2010saving but is not immediately life saving. The majority of cases of living donor kidney transplantation can be postponed without significant impact on the recipient. Although the clinical outcomes of transplant recipients with COVID\u201019 are not known, based on previous SARS and MERS publications, the mortality could be high and nasopharyngeal and tissue viral loads may be greater than in immune competence. Therefore, a decision must be made by individual programs whether to newly immunosuppress patients and send them out into the community during the COVID\u201019 pandemic. The other part of the decision is how much health\u2010care resource is utilized by newly transplanted patients with regard to readmission rates and whether during a period of strained hospital resources, it would be appropriate to perform kidney transplantation. It has been suggested, that the risk of infection in the community for a newly transplanted recipient may be mitigated by either not using induction therapy or using an IL2 receptor antagonist for induction rather than polyclonal globulin induction. This is unknown but is a logical extension of data from other viral infections. Another possibility is to temporarily pause kidney transplantation but continue to transplant highly sensitized patients. This has been done in some jurisdictions.",

During the COVID\u201019 pandemic, the TID physician can serve as a critical resource in an evolving environment. Although there are no publications on transplant recipients currently, transplant recipients have acquired COVID\u201019 and anecdotal information suggests that there is a spectrum of illness ranging from mild to severe disease. It is likely that these patients may also have higher viral loads with prolonged shedding. This may require longer quarantine periods until patients can be confirmed swab negative (eg, we use 2 consecutive negative swabs to terminate quarantine). With regard to treatment of an infected transplant recipient, the ID physician can be instrumental in obtaining and suggesting experimental therapies. Currently, there are many clinical trials and experimental therapies for COVID\u201019 including remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir\u2010cobicistat, interferon beta and (hydroxy)chloroquine, as well as combinations of these therapies. Passive high\u2010titer immunoglobulin from recovered COVID patients has been used. Blunting the inflammatory response with a trial of corticosteroids is controversial.\n9\n, \n10\n However, reduction of IL\u20106 in critically ill patients with tocilizumab has also been attempted. Detailed treatment algorithms are beyond the scope of this viewpoint, and are continually evolving as new data emerge. Numerous centers and groups have developed treatment guidelines for transplant and nontransplant patients. Antimicrobial management of the critically ill transplant patient (including potential drug interaction between antivirals and immunosuppressive drugs), an understanding of experimental therapies and clinical trials, as well as working with the transplant physician in reducing immunosuppression are all roles of a transplant infectious disease physician. The TID physician is also important at a programmatic level. Since surges in hospital capacity are predicted to occur with COVID\u201019, the TID physician can also determine whether non\u2010COVID\u201019 patients with infections can be safely discharged home on oral or home IV therapies. Transplant ID physicians can also serve as an educational resource for other transplant physicians and coordinators, assist in answering patient queries regarding COVID\u201019. They can also be instrumental in building screening strategies for transplant patients, that is decide who can be safely managed as outpatient and who needs hospital admission. Overall, TID physicians can act as a linchpin of the transplant program during the COVID\u201019 pandemic by establishing safety procedures of donor and recipients, providing up\u2010to\u2010date educational tools, and prioritizing transplant activities according to evolution of the epidemiology of the pandemic.",

Experts within societies should disseminate donor screening algorithms, share advice for transplant programs, and management of transplant recipients. The American Society of Transplantation has rapidly created an information sheet for transplant professionals including suggestions for donor screening. In addition, information specific for transplant recipients has also been created. Similarly, The Transplantation Society has also provided information on COVID\u201019 for transplant professionals. Platforms such as webinars, virtual town halls, chat groups can be used to quickly exchange information. Transplant societies can also act as a conduit for research collaborations on COVID\u201019. For instance, the Spanish Group for the Study of Infection in Transplantation and the Immunocompromised Host (GESITRA\u2010IC/SEIMC) has drafted a consensus guideline for the therapeutic management of transplant recipients with COVID\u201019 and has established a prospective multicenter registry to obtain real\u2010time data from clinical experience.",
