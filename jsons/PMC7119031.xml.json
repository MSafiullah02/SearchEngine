Depending on the method of sequence analysis used, SARS-CoV either constitutes a new phylogenetic group or a subgroup of group II CoVs 10, 11. The organization of the positive-stranded RNA genome of SARS-CoV, which is 29.7 kb in size, resembles that of other coronaviruses and harbors open-reading frames (ORFs) that encode a large polyprotein required for genome replication, four structural proteins and eight additional polypeptides of unclear function (Figure 1\n) [1]. Replication of SARS-CoV is briefly described in Box 1\n. The S, M and E proteins are incorporated into the viral envelope, and S-protein dimers or trimers protrude from the viral membrane, providing CoVs with a characteristic corona-resembling shape.Box 1Replication of coronavirusesThe spike protein (S) of coronavirus (CoV) particles binds to a cellular receptor that promotes fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. Thereby, the positive-stranded RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm, where the host cell machinery immediately translates the first large overlapping open-reading frames ORF1a/b. The resulting protein, the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, is responsible for replication of the viral genome as well as for generation of a set of subgenomic mRNAs. These comprise RNAs encoding the nucleocapsid protein (N) and the envelope glycoproteins E (small envelope protein), M (membrane protein), the S-protein and 8 proteins of unknown function. The envelope proteins are processed in the ER\u2013Golgi apparatus and transported to the budding compartment, where the M-protein associates with the helical nucleocapsid and the E- and S-proteins. Progeny virions are released from infected cells by exocytosis.",

            "text": "Binding of viral GPs to cellular factors other than the receptor(s) does not enable entry but can enhance viral infection. Therefore, various pathogens, including HIV, are thought to interact with factors on dendritic cells (DCs) to promote their spread within infected individuals [12]. Binding of HIV to DCs facilitates infection of nearby susceptible cells through a mechanism that is not completely understood. The lectin DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific ICAM-grabbing non-integrin) or related molecules might be instrumental to this process because DC-SIGN expressed on cell lines binds to the GP of HIV and catalyzes infection of adjacent receptor-positive cells [12]. DC-SIGN also interacts with SARS-CoV S-protein and augments infection with retroviral particles bearing the S-protein in their envelope 13, 14. This observation is reflected by efficient DC-mediated SARS-CoV transmission to target cells 13, 14, however, factors other than DC-SIGN are clearly involved in viral transfer [13]. Notably, DCs are not permissive to virus infection, indicating that productive infection is not required for transmission 13, 14. However, the interaction of SARS-CoV with DCs could contribute to SARS pathogenesis. Attachment of SARS-CoV to dermal DCs might facilitate viral spread in the skin, whereas DC-SIGN-positive alveolar macrophages could promote SARS-CoV replication in the lung. Moreover, internalization of SARS-CoV by DCs might provide the virus with a means of immune escape.",

The first essential step in CoV S-driven infection is therefore the interaction of the S-protein with cellular receptors. Consequently, the S-protein ectodomain is the sole determinant of CoV cell-tropism [15]. The receptor-binding domain located in the S1 subunit exhibits little conservation between CoVs, reflecting the interaction with different cellular receptors (Figure 1; Table 1). Thus, residues 407 to 547 in the S-protein of 229E interact with the metalloprotease CD13 16, 17, whereas residues 1 to 330 of the murine hepatitis virus (MHV) S-protein bind to carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) 17, 18.

They had used a soluble S1\u2013immunoglobulin (Ig) fusion protein for immunoprecipitation experiments with lysates from Vero E6 cells, the cell type used for the isolation of SARS-CoV. Subsequent proteomic analysis revealed ACE2 to be a high-affinity binding partner of S1. Inhibition of SARS-CoV infection of susceptible cells using antibodies against ACE2, in conjunction with the observation that ACE2 expression in an otherwise poorly susceptible cell line strongly augmented viral replication, indicated that the protein facilitated SARS-CoV infection [21].

            "text": "Binding studies using soluble fragments of SARS-CoV S-protein revealed residues 318 to 510 to be the minimal receptor-binding domain 23, 24, 25. An initial search for S-protein residues that are important for ACE2 binding pointed to E452 and D454, with the latter being crucial for association with ACE2 [24]. However, the exact regions of ACE2 that are in contact with the S-protein remain undetermined. Recently, the structure of the ACE2 ectodomain has been resolved, revealing two ridges flanking the catalytic site [26]. Molecular modeling suggests that these ridges might interact with the S-protein [27]. Interestingly, binding of ACE2 to an inhibitor and probably also to substrate induces structural changes within these ridges [26] and might interfere with binding to the S-protein. Detailed analysis will be required to identify residues within the S-protein and ACE2 that are critical for their interaction; and therefore represent attractive targets for inhibitors. These studies might also have important implications for the development of small animal models. Thus, ACE2 from African green monkeys enables efficient entry of SARS-CoV [28], and infection of some macaque species reproduces aspects of SARS in humans 5, 6, while viral replication in mice is less robust and does not induce disease [29]. It will therefore be important to determine if a potentially reduced interaction of SARS-CoV S-protein with murine ACE2 limits viral spread in these animals. If so, the generation of transgenic animals is warranted [21].",

            "text": "ACE2, a carboxypeptidase that cleaves polypeptides from the renal-angiotensin system [30], is essential for cardiac function [31] and is expressed in various tissues and organs [32]. Importantly, major target cells of SARS-CoV, such as pneumocytes 4, 33, 34, 35, express ACE2 [32], and expression in cell lines correlates with permissiveness to SARS-CoV S-driven infection [28], indicating that ACE2 plays a central role in SARS-CoV replication. Notably, evidence for the requirement of a coreceptor or the existence of alternative receptors for SARS-CoV entry into certain tissues has not been reported to date. However, ACE2-dependent infection of organs other than the lung might contribute to SARS pathogenesis. For example, small intestinal enterocytes express ACE2 [32] and are permissive for SARS-CoV 35, 36, 37. Moreover, the efficient infection of renal epithelial cells of different species [14] and isolation of the virus from kidney tissue of a SARS patient [3] suggests that SARS-CoV infection of kidney cells might contribute to acute renal failure observed in some SARS patients 14, 38. Infection of intestinal enterocytes and kidney cells could facilitate viral transmission via feces. Viral RNA has been detected in stool samples from SARS patients 4, 37, 39, however, it is unclear if transmission via feces promoted viral spread during the 2003 outbreak. Hepatocytes from SARS patients were also found to be infected [36], and some ACE2-expressing hepatoma cell lines are highly permissive to replication of SARS-CoV 14, 28, 40, 41. Infection of hepatocytes might therefore partially account for the altered levels of liver-specific enzymes commonly observed in SARS patients 4, 40. Because liver tissue has been found to be largely negative for ACE2 protein expression [32], it will be interesting to examine if viral entry is facilitated by low levels of ACE2 or different factors.",

First, binding to receptor can directly activate the fusion process 42, 43, which is the case for HIV and murine leukemia virus (MLV) GPs. Alternatively, receptor engagement can trigger the internalization of viral particles into endosomes where protonation activates GP-driven membrane fusion 42, 43. Influenza hemagglutinin and the vesicular stomatitis virus G-protein (VSV-G) are activated by low pH. Inhibitors of vacuolar acidification block infection by S-bearing pseudotypes, indicating that low pH triggers the fusion activity of SARS-CoV S-protein (Figure 2) 14, 40, 41. However, SARS-CoV S-driven cell-to-cell fusion can occur in the absence of low pH 25, 44, at least under conditions of GP and receptor overexpression. Therefore, the S-protein of SARS-CoV might be able to mediate membrane fusion in a pH-dependent and independent fashion, and several parameters might control which stimulus is required.",

By contrast, S-proteins of group I CoVs are not cleaved at all and cleavage of the S-protein of MHV, a group II CoV, appears to be cell-type dependent and not required for function 45, 46. No obvious consensus sites for cellular proteases were detected in SARS-CoV S 7, 8 and efficient cleavage of the protein has not been reported 25, 45, 47, 48, although more cell types need to be examined. Notably, protease treatment of S-expressing cells increased cell-to-cell fusion [41], indicating that cleavage of S might enable pH-independent, receptor-dependent triggering of the fusion activity.

The function of these elements has been elucidated in the context of prototype class I fusion proteins, such as HIV gp160 [49]. Cleavage of gp160 produces the fusion active form of the transmembrane subunit gp41, which is oriented perpendicular to the viral membrane and contains a fusion peptide (a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids) at its N-terminus. Two HRs (HR1 and HR2) are located between the fusion peptide and the transmembrane domain. During the fusion process, the fusion peptide inserts into the target cell membrane, HR2 folds back onto HR1, and a six-helix bundle structure (trimer of dimers) is formed. In this conformation, the HRs are oriented in an anti-parallel fashion, thereby bringing the fusion peptide (inserted into the target cell membrane) and the transmembrane domain (inserted into the viral membrane) into close contact, which ultimately promotes membrane fusion [49].",

Cleavage of many CoV S-proteins, including that of SARS-CoV, is dispensable for function and therefore these proteins must harbor an internal fusion peptide similar to the G-protein of VSV. A computer-based analysis has predicted a potential fusion peptide at the N-terminus of HR1 in SARS-CoV S 45, 51. In the light of these observations, the model for membrane fusion illustrated previously must be revised for the SARS-CoV S-protein. Thus, upon exposure to low pH it is probable that an internal fusion peptide, which is covalently associated with both the S1 and S2 subunits, inserts into the target cell membrane, and membrane fusion is driven by the formation of the six-helix bundle between HR1 and HR2 (Figure 3). In case of influenza HA, a low pH environment triggers irreversible conformational changes associated with membrane fusion, whereas exposure of VSV-G to low pH induces a reversible transition into the fusion active state [49]. The nature of pH-induced conformational changes in SARS-CoV S-protein remains to be determined.",

These data, in conjunction with neutralization of S-driven infection using sera obtained from convalescent SARS patients 40, 41 and also using a monoclonal antibody directed against the S1 subunit [58], indicate that S-based vaccines are promising for future human trials. However, triggering inflammation in S-vaccinated but not in control animals has also been reported [59] and an enhancing effect of S-specific antibodies on feline infectious peritonitis virus replication is well established [60]. Therefore, S-based vaccines need to be carefully characterized in several animal models before being administered to humans.",

Vaccines designed on the basis of the S-protein are promising, but require thorough evaluation in various animal models before administration to humans.

S-proteins of coronaviruses exhibit a domain organization that is characteristic of class I fusion proteins. Prototype members of this group of proteins include hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza virus and the gp160 envelope protein of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [49], which are also shown. Generally, these viral glycoproteins can be subdivided into the N-terminal receptor-binding S1 subunit, followed by the S2 subunit containing structural elements required for membrane fusion: a fusogenic peptide and two amino acid stretches with helical symmetry (HR1 and HR2) 17, 50. Proteolytic cleavage into the S1 and S2 subunits by host-cell proteases is indicated by a triangular arrow. Functional regions within the NL63 S-protein were predicted using sequence similarity to the closest related coronavirus member hCoV-229E [61].

Binding of a viral glycoprotein (GP) to a receptor can induce conformational alterations, which facilitate fusion of the viral and plasma membrane leading to release of the viral nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm (left). Alternatively, binding to the receptor can be followed by uptake of the virion into an endosomal compartment (right) 42, 43. Proton influx into the endosome can then trigger the membrane fusion activity in GP. Inhibitors of acidification, such as ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) or bafilomycin A (BAF), can be used to dissect both pathways because they specifically block pH-dependent membrane fusion. For entry of SARS-CoV S-bearing particles, the endosomal pathway appears to be important 14, 40, 41. However, an acid environment has been shown to be dispensable for the fusion of cells that express the S-protein to adjoining cells that express the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) 25, 41.",

Binding of SARS-CoV spike (S)-protein to ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) promotes internalization into endosomes, where the low pH environment triggers fusion activity in the S-protein. Membrane fusion is driven by the S2 subunit of S, which contains a putative fusion peptide and two heptad repeats (HRs) 7, 8. Upon insertion of the fusion peptide into the host cell membrane, HR1 folds back onto HR2, forming a highly stable six-helix bundle 45, 47, 51, 54. The formation of the six helix bundle brings the viral and the host cell membrane in close proximity and ultimately promotes membrane fusion (upper panel). The HRs are attractive targets for antiviral therapy; synthetic peptides mimicking HR2 can complex the HR1 regions, which inhibits the formation of the six-helix bundle (lower panel) 45, 47, 53.",
