            "text": "Mathematical modeling of the UV disinfection process provides a basis for sizing ultraviolet disinfection equipment and for interpreting test results. It also allows for adaptation of UV systems to specific disinfection processes and for the disinfection of specific microorganisms. Disinfection is generally modeled in terms of the survival, or its converse the inactivation rate, and may be rendered as a fraction or a percentage. Disinfection is invariably a logarithmic process, as is microbial growth. The disinfection rate of the microorganisms varies widely and is subject to many complexities, including shoulder effects, second stage decay, relative humidity effects, and photoreactivation. Not all these processes need be considered for every design application, but a familiarity with these effects is essential for understanding UV disinfection. Furthermore, not all of these processes can be completely and accurately modeled at present, but enough is known to adequately design reliable UV disinfection systems. All of these processes can be modeled with basic exponential equations and by using computational methods if necessary. For more detailed background information on theoretical decay models for general disinfection purposes see Kowalski (2006), Chick et al. (1963), or Hiatt (1964).",

If the irradiance forms a contour across a surface, such as a wall, floor, or cooling coil, then the surface can be subdivided and the total UV dose can be summed per unit area to get an area-weighted average dose. Since the irradiance field of a UV lamp on a surface can be subject to exponential variations, in which the near-field has a wide range of irradiance while the far field becomes relatively constant, it is often necessary to either use a very fine grid (i.e. 50 \u00d7 50 or 100 \u00d7 100) or to arrange the grid logarithmically so as to concentrate more gridlines in near-field areas of great variation.",

When the exposure dose is sufficient to cause several logs of reduction (i.e. 99% disinfection or higher) in the microbial population, the surviving population is often an order of magnitude more resistant to UV. That is, the UV rate constant for the resistant population may be ten times lower than for the first stage. This effect will, of course, only be apparent if the disinfection rate is very high, sometime as much as six logs of disinfection. In effect, most microbial populations behave as if two separate populations were present \u2013 one relatively susceptible and one relatively resistant. The first stage of decay (fast decay) will then be defined by the susceptible portion of the population and the second stage of decay (slow decay) will be defined by the resistant population. Since the resistant fraction is often on the order of about 1% or less, the second stage only becomes manifest at about the D99 value or higher.

Shoulder curves start out with a horizontal slope before developing into full exponential decay. The lag in response to the stimulus implies that either a threshold dose is necessary before measurable effects occur or that that repair mechanisms actively deal with low-level damage at low doses (Casarett 1968). Once the threshold is passed the exponential decay curve becomes fully developed (as a single stage or two stage curve). The effect is species dependent and also appears to be a function of the intensity of irradiation. In many cases it can be neglected, especially for susceptible microbes or for high doses. However, for low irradiance levels and for spores and certain resistant bacteria the shoulder can be significant and prolonged. There are at least two separate mathematical models that can deal with shoulder effects \u2013 the classic model, and the multihit target model (Kowalski et al. 2000). Various similar target models have been proposed, including recovery models, split-dose recovery models, and empirical models (Russell 1982, Harm 1980, Casarett 1968), but the multihit model, is the most convenient approach for most applications and it is the one addressed here.

It presumably represents the number of discrete critical sites that must be hit to inactivate the microorganism. In theory n is an integer, but in practice this is not always the case. The value of n is unique to each species and values may range from near-unity to over 1000. Figure 3.3shows data for UV-irradiated Staphylococcus in which a shoulder is evident. The rate constant, k = 0.1702 m2/J and the exponent value is n = 4.92. The extrapolated first stage is shown with a dotted line, where it can be seen that the y-axis is intercepted at the exponent of n = 4.92.\n\n",

In fact, these differences may be barely beyond the testing accuracy in most cases and therefore the conclusion that virus sensitivity decreases as RH increases must be considered a tenuous one until such time as more definitive data is accumulated on a larger number of viruses. Although DNA viruses go though a conformational change from the A form to the B form as RH increases, RNA viruses may not. RNA viruses are typically in the A conformation and if the conformation change is entirely responsible for RH effect, it could be expected that RNA viruses would not respond to RH changes. There is, however, a possible secondary effect from RH \u2013increased bonding of water to the virus may increases the effective diameter and causes more UV scattering.

Although it would be convenient if the UV rate constant at 100% RH equaled the UV rate constant in water there is no conclusive evidence that this occurs. In fact, photoprotective effects due to UV scattering in air (refractive index = 1.0003) must be different from those in water (refractive index = 1.33) and therefore even at 100% RH the UV rate constant in air is unlikely to be identical to that in water.

Photoreactivation occurs when microorganisms are exposed to visible light during or after UV irradiation (Setlow and Carrier 1966, Fletcher et al. 2003). This process can result in self-repair of damaged microbes and can cause a fraction of the population to recover from UV inactivation. Photoreactivation has been studied at length in water-based UV experiments but the data for photoreactivation of airborne microbes is limited at present (Linden and Darby 1994, Masschelein 2002). One study indicates the decay rate of Mycobacterium parafortuitum under UV exposure in liquid suspension is effectively decreased by simultaneous exposure to visible light (Peccia and Hernandez 2001). The same study suggests that airborne microbial populations can recover significantly if allowed sufficient time. Knudson (1986) investigated the photoreactivation of Bacillus anthracis and found that although vegetative cells had a 1\u20132 log higher survival rate after exposure to photoreactivating light, the spore forms had no detectable photoreactivation.",

Ideally, the RH would be kept below approximately 65% in any UVGI system, and the UVGI enclosure should admit little or no internal visible light. Studies on photoreactivation generally involve narrow band UVC lamps, whereas the evidence suggests that broad band UV lamps inhibit photoreactivation (Masschelein 2002). Damage to the enzymes needed for photoreactivation may occur more easily under broadband UVC/UVB radiation, since the peak absorption efficiency for enzymes is at higher wavelengths than that for DNA. Harm (1980) showed that absorption by proteins in the UVA and UVB region equaled the absorption by DNA at 265 nm. Hu et al. (2005) have shown that the DNA of Escherichia coli was repaired following irradiation with a low pressure, narrow-band UV lamp while there was no photorepair following irradiation with a medium pressure, broad-band UV lamp. Zimmer and Slawson (2002) found that high levels of photorepair, peaking after 2\u20133 hours, occurred in E. coli after exposure from low pressure lamps, virtually no photorepair occurred after exposure from medium pressure lamps.",

            "text": "The air temperature has a negligible impact on microbial survival during UVGI irradiation provided that neither heat damage nor freezing occurs (Rentschler et al. 1941). It is possible that high indoor temperatures combined with high humidity may alter the effects of UV to some unknown degree. Most building ventilation systems maintain air temperatures in a narrow range between approximately 13\u201327\u00b0C (55\u201380\u00b0F) and moderate relative humidity (<70%), and therefore the effect of temperature on microbes can be ignored. However, air temperature may impact UV lamp output by overcooling the lamp, especially when air velocity is beyond design limits. See 10.1007/978-3-642-01999-9_5 for information on modeling lamp cooling effects.",
