First, while we addressed confounding via restriction 137 and statistical adjustment, baseline characteristics suggest that chloroquine users with cardiac 138 history were channeled away from azithromycin, and residual confounding may have masked 139 subtle effects. For example, patients with higher risk for cardiac adverse events may be intentionally prescribed other antibiotics when azithromycin would be on option, thus 141 mitigating the effect. Second, we may have underestimated the actual risk of cardiac adverse 142 events among new users of the chloroquine and azithromycin combination, because our 143 population included patients with long-term chloroquine use who may have been tolerating the 144 drug well. Ideally, patients who initiate both drugs simultaneously, as proposed for COVID-19 145 treatment, would be studied, but restriction our analysis to such a population was prohibitive in 146 terms of sample size.
