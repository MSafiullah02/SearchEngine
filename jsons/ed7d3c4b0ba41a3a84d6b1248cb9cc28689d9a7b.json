            "text": "In late December of 2019, a new coronavirus was discovered in China. On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization named the disease caused by this virus COVID-19. The disease quickly spread to Chinese cities and other parts of the world, including Thailand, Japan, Taiwan and Iran. 1 The number of infected patients increased daily until the World Health Organization in June declared the outbreak a serious and urgent threat to public health. Most people infected with the virus recover well, but some also may experience fatal complications, such as acute organ failure, septic shock, acute pulmonary edema, acute pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. 1 As infection has been transmitted from individual to individual, 2 the first cases of the disease in areas outside of Wuhan, occurred in travelers from Wuhan; as The First Case of COVID-19 was confirmed to be a 35-year-old woman living in Wuhan who traveled to Korea. 3 On January 20, 2020, a 55-year-old woman working in Wuhan, arrived at Taiwan and was referred to quarantine authorities with symptoms of sore throat, dry cough, fatigue, and feeling low-grade fever on January 11. 4 While COVID-19 infection seems to be more prevalent in adults than in children, rare cases of children infection are being reported, mainly seen in family clusters. 5 The presented case is a 75-day-old infant that was referred to the pediatric emergency department, with a history of severe dry cough and abnormal noisy breathing sound (heard without a stethoscope) during the last 11 days. The patient had been suffering from fever since about 7 days ago; the fever was having a good response to antipyretic. But mother had not been using a thermometer for screening the fever. About three days ago coughs got more severe, along with an increased breathing sound and dyspnea appeared. On arrival, the infant had a respiratory rate of 50 per minute, a temperature of 37.6 centigrade, Pulse Rate of 172 and O2 saturation of 85%. In physical examination, an intercostal retraction was seen and lung auscultation revealed diminished wheeze and ralse in both sides. After taking oxygen with the hood, the O2 saturation got increased to 97% and intercostal retraction disappeared. Therefore, respiratory rate reduced to 35 times per minute. A normal complete blood count and levels of Na \u00fe and K \u00fe were reported upon the patient's arrival. The High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the patient after two hours of patient arrival is shown in Fig. 1 , which shows bilateral peripheral consolidation with a ground glass view. While, as reviewed in Cao et al. study, most studies have reported the infection to be more severe in adults rather than the child, the dissemination of COVID-19 in children implies that it has high transmitting potential in a specific transmission dynamics. 5 Pediatricians have to know more about the epidemiological and clinical aspects of the disease to diagnose and control COVID-19.
