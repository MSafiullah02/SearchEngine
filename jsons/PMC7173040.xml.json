            "text": "The innate immunity is composed of several families of pattern recognition receptors (PPRs). The latter receptors serve to identify pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). The PPRs act as the primary defense against pathogenic entities and control the activation and progression of the adaptive immunity by activating the production not only of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and interferons, but also B and T cells. Among the PPRs, the Toll-like Receptors (TLRs) are of special interest. Their discovery more than 30 years ago has improved knowledge in the regulation of innate immunity, inflammation and cytokines induction.",

Among endosomal TLRs, TLR7 and TLR8 have a high degree of sequence homology and function similarity. Both receptors recognize viral single-stranded RNAs, as well as synthetic tricyclic derivatives belonging to the imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline series such as resiquimod (1), a TLRs 7/8 agonist (Fig. 1\n). Many novel TLRs 7/8 agonists from different chemical series have been developed these last years. The immunostimulating activity of these agonists allows them to intervene in the therapy of several diseases and to be valuable vaccine adjuvant candidates. In contrast, chronic immune activation by a sustained TLR activation is a hallmark of several infectious, autoimmune and malignant diseases. Therefore, the development of TLRs 7/8 antagonists may also play an important role in the therapy of these diseases. The evidence of the therapeutic potential of TLRs 7/8 ligands has prompted many pharmaceutical companies and research institutes to design, synthetize and optimize TLRs modulators.",

The structural analogies between our synthetized imidazo[1,5-a]quinoxalines, pyrazolo[1,5-a]quinoxalines, imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazines and imiquimod, set the future lines of our research both in chemistry and biology, allowing us to focus on the TLRs 7/8 immunomodulatory effects of bi- and tri-cyclic derivatives [[9], [10], [11]]. In this review, we gather more than 340 publications until January 2020 relating to TLR7 and TLR8 modulators. By the extent of these data, we show in this review that the modulation of TLR activity is not easy despite many SAR studies around various recognized chemical cores. Not only minimal structures but also macromolecules have been considered and prepared by researchers. In the first chapter, we briefly present data concerning the expression, the structure and the signaling pathways of TLR7 and TLR8. This information will help to better understand the importance of targeting these receptors and the interest of preparing compounds able to modulate the inherent biological responses. We then focus in a second and a third chapter on the implication of TLR7 and TLR8 agonists and antagonists, respectively, in therapeutic treatments, and describe the natural and synthetic ligands focusing mainly on small organic compounds. In a final chapter, we have exposed all the clinical cases using agonist and antagonist ligands clearly referring to receptors.",

Low levels of TLR7 have also been observed in non-immune cells such as hepatocytes, epithelial cells and keratinocytes [[22], [23], [24], [25]]. Contrary to TLR7, TLR8 is more strongly expressed in myeloid dendritic cells, monocytes and to a lesser extent in pDC [13,26]. Under certain circumstances, TLR7 expression is inducible in cells expressing a basal, undetectable level of TLR7, including immune cells such as macrophages, myeloid dendritic cells and non-immune cells such as hepatocytes and keratinocytes [[27], [28], [29]]. For example, TLR7 mRNA expression is induced by the stimulation of IFN\u03b3 in macrophage level. Similarly, viral infections such as hepatitis C, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the influenza A virus lead to upregulation of TLR7 expression in hepatocytes, circulating immune cells and primary macrophages respectively [27,30]. Under these circumstances, it seems that the cytokines induced by the viral infection are responsible for triggering the induction of TLR7 expression. In fact, infection of primary macrophages by the influenza virus leads to upregulation of TLR7 mRNA in a type I IFN dependent manner [30]. In addition, the increased expression of TLRs 7 and 8 is observed in cancer and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [28,31,32].",

Following the activation of TLRs 7/8, MyD88 interacts, through its death domain, with the death domains of members of the IRAK (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase) protein kinase family, including IRAK1, IRAK2, IRAK4 and IRAK-M [39,40]. IRAK4 phosphorylates and activates IRAK1. After phosphorylation of IRAK4 and IRAK1, these two kinases dissociate from MyD88 and interact with TRAF6 with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. TRAF6, together with the ubiquitin E3: UBC13 and UEV1A conjugation enzyme, favor the lysine-related polyubiquitination of TRAF6 itself and the TAK1 protein kinase complex [41]. The latter is a member of the MAPKKK family and forms a complex with the regulatory subunits TAB1, TAB2 and TAB3 that will interact with the TRAF6-generated polyubiquitin chains to allow activation of TAK1 [41]. TAK1 then activates two signaling pathways: NF-\u03ba\u03b2 and MAPK pathways. The IKK complex is composed of two catalytic subunits: IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 and a regulatory subunit NEMO (or IKK\u03b3). TAK1 binds to the IKK complex via ubiquitin chains, allowing it to phosphorylate and activate IKK\u03b2. The IKK complex phosphorylates the inhibitory protein of NF-\u03ba\u03b2: I\u03ba\u03b2\u03b1, which will undergo degradation in the cytoplasm, thus allowing NF-\u03ba\u03b2 to translocate to the nucleus to induce the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. In addition, TAK1 also activates members of the MAPKs family such as ERK1/2, p38 and JNK, which mediate the activation of the AP-1 transcription factor, responsible for the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and IFN\u03b2 (Fig. 2) [42,43].",

They studied the production of IL12 and IFN\u03b1 by dendritic cells during TLR7 agonist stimulation. They found that the cytokine induction pattern differs between myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) and pDCs. pDCs produce IFN\u03b1 while mDCs produce IL12 [44]. Given the large amounts of IFN\u03b1 produced by pDCs expressing TLRs 7 and 9, much work has been published in the literature to elucidate the signaling pathway leading to activation and secretion of IFN\u03b1 especially by dendritic cells. TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 induce antiviral responses by the production of IFN\u03b1 as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines. These three receptors use the MyD88 adapter protein to initiate the signaling pathways. The IRF7 transcription factor (Interferon regulatory factor 7) is responsible for the expression and production of IFN\u03b1. MyD88 interacts directly with IRF7 at the endosome [45]. IRF7 also interacts with TRAF6, another adapter molecule that operates downstream of MyD88, and after receptor activation (TLRs 7, 8 or 9), IRF7 is activated in a MyD88 and TRAF6 dependent manner. Splenic pDCs from IRF7-deficient mice show a significant decrease in IFN\u03b1 induction following viral infection or exposure to synthetic TLR7 or 9 ligands [46]. On the other hand, this induction is normal in IRF1, IRF3 or IRF5-deficient pDCs. This shows that induction of IFN\u03b1 in pDCs requires IRF7 [46]. In addition, MyD88 mutation studies have shown that this protein interacts with IRF7 via its death domain. This death domain also interacts with the serine/threonine kinase family (IRAK), which will transduce the signal between MyD88 and TRAF6, indicating that IRAKs are involved in the signaling of IRF7 [47]. pDCs from IRAK1 or IRAK4-deficient mice are unable to produce IFN\u03b1 upon activation of TLRs 7, 8 or 9 [46]. In addition, one study has shown that IKK\u03b1 is also essential for activation of IRF7 [48], indicating that activation of IRF7 requires a cascade of IRAK4-IRAK1-IKK\u03b1 protein kinases. Studies have also shown that TRAF3 plays an important role in this IRF7-dependent signaling [46].",

Activation of the MyD88-dependent signaling pathway by TLR7 or TLR9 ligands leads to translocation of IRF5 to the nucleus where it will activate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [50]. In 2005, Schoenemeyer et al. have shown that stimulation of TLR7 and TLR8 by resiquimod induces the activation of IRF5 as well as IRF7, and they also found that IRF5 is a central mediator in TLRs 7/8 signaling pathway. IRF5 contributes to the induction of IFN type I in human cells, and in addition, is important not only for IFN\u03b1 induction but also for IFN\u03b2 induction [50]. In 2009, a study showed that mDCs, and not pDCs or macrophages, are capable of inducing a large amount of IFN\u03b2 after bacterial degradation in phagolysosomes and such response requires the intervention of TLR7, MyD88 and IRF1 [51].",

This response to viral infection is mediated through several TLR signaling pathways including TLR3, TLRs 7/8/9, TLR4 and TLR2. The contribution of each TLR is different depending on the virus, cell type and infection model examined. TLR7 and 8 are able to detect GU-rich and AU-rich ssRNA sequences of RNA viruses [36,52]. They are known to serve as endosomal PRRs for a number of ssRNA viruses as influenza, HIV-1, vesicular stomatitis virus, Sendai virus, flaviviruses, and coronaviruses [36,[53], [54], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60]]. Moreover, TLR7 signaling is well described in human and mice for type I IFN production by pDCs in response to ssRNA viral stimuli [52], and TLR8 signaling mainly results in NF-\u03baB activation and subsequent inflammatory cytokine expression [61]. Shortly after TLR7 and TLR8 description, it was shown that both receptors respond to potent antiviral imidazoquinoline compounds.

The efficacy of the resulting immunization strongly varies with the ingredients of the vaccine. As the vaccine employed in the early stages of vaccinology were live attenuated or killed organisms, adjuvants were not systematically required. Currently employed adjuvants in human vaccines are aluminum salts, oil in water emulsions (e.g. MF59) and TLR9 adjuvants which have limitations and require multiple administrations to induce protection and drive Th2- over Th1-polarized immunity. Moreover, vaccinology moves toward the use of inactivated antigens which lack the immunological information needed to enhance an adaptive immunity response. Hence, the development of novel adjuvants and delivery systems to replace the ones actually used has become crucial to improve vaccine-induced protective immunity [63]. TLR7 and TLR8 together mediate recognition of purine-rich ssRNA to elicit an immune response to pathogens recognized in the endosome. TLRs 7 and 8 are implicated in the recognition of naturally derived uridine\u2013rich ssRNAs of influenza and HIV [36]. In addition TLR7 and TLR8 recognize bacterial RNA [51,64]. Furthermore, TLR7 and 8 are expressed in human plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), in T and B cells, monocytes and macrophages [65,66]. Naive human B cells express low levels of TLR7 and, whereas activated and memory human B cells also express a broader range of TLRs including TLR7. B cell intrinsic TLR7 signaling may play a role in B cell responses during chronic infections which could be used to activate memory B cells and boost humoral immune responses during immunization [67]. Synthetic small molecules agonists, which activate TLRs 7 and 8 and could be used as adjuvants, have been identified and presented herein. However, the challenge in the development of these molecules remains their formulation.",

TLRs agonists could be promising elements for novel therapies. Whereas many studies suggest that the activation of TLRs may have potential applications in oncotherapy, others have proved that TLRs signaling is also implicated in tumorigenesis. Even if fighting cancers by TLRs targeting is always under investigation, human clinical trials often failed. Many patients are immunosuppressed due to the traditional anticancer therapies. By this way, it is difficult to induce a positive immune response able to help organism to combat tumors. Understanding the role of TLRs in all cancer cells types remains the main obstacle for clinical therapeutic application. Combination of modulators and traditional approaches (chemotherapy or radiotherapy) could be the key for a successful anticancer therapy [[68], [69], [70]].",

Asthma affects more than 350 million people worldwide. Allergy and atopy are the main causes of asthma. Genetic and environmental triggers modulating the activation and regulation of the immune system are also implicated in the pathophysiology of asthma. Bronchial inflammation, smooth muscle spasm, and mucus production in allergic asthma are triggered by IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, which are released by Th2 cells. TLR7 ligands play an important role in reduction of airway inflammation, promoting Th1 responses in immune cells, reversing airway hyper-responsiveness, and preventing airway remodeling (including smooth muscle proliferation and goblet cell hyperplasia). Acute and chronic asthma attacks can be managed by precisely identifying the regulators of these pathogenic pathways and targeting their molecular mediators [73,74].",

In addition, studies have shown that adenosine- and uridine-rich oligoribonucleotides (ORNs) are capable of activating TLR8, without any effect on TLR7, while guanosine-rich ORNs activate TLR7 and TLR8-dependent signaling [52]. In quest of TLR7 and TLR8 agonists, a range of chemical modifications was done to natural ORN ligands in order to increase their selectivity for TLR7 and/or TLR8 and stability against nucleases [[75], [76], [77], [78]].",

Similarly, ssRNA enhances the affinity of guanosine, dG, 8-OHG, and 8-OHdG to TLR7. Considering that these nucleotides are metabolites present in the physiological or pathological state, they can be considered as endogenous ligands of TLR7. These results were confirmed by Zhang et al. by showing in 2016 that TLR7 also recognizes the degraded form of ssRNA: guanosine binds to the first site while the oligonucleotide (polyU) binds to the second site, and the combination of these two products activates the dimerization of TLR7 in a synergistic way [80].",

SAR studies showed that the presence of a benzyl group at the N9 position as well as a C8 hydroxyl group in compound 5 is essential for IFN induction. The introduction of a R substituent such as alkyl, alkylthio, alkylamino and alkoxy groups to the 8-hydroxyadenine moiety resulted in a remarkable increase in activity. The 2-alkylthio (6 to 8), 2-butylamino (9) and 2-butoxy (10) analogues showed important activities after oral administration in mice. IFN-inducing activity of compound 11 is 10 times higher than that of imiquimod after oral administration in mice. Furthermore, compound 11 has a better oral tolerance compared to imiquimod (Fig. 20) in mice. These results indicate that compound 11 has a better efficacy and safety profile compared to imiquimod.",

SM-360320 is a TLR7 agonist and is able to activate immune responses against the HCV, as shown by Lee et al. [99] It induces IFN\u03b1 in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with an EC50 value of 0.14 \u03bcM [100]. At 10 \u03bcM, SM-360320 was shown to reduce HCV levels by 60% in 24 h in the human hepatocyte cell line Huh7, which carries a HCV replicon [99]. It induces IFN in mice with a minimal effective dose of approximately 0.03 mg/kg, making it approximately 100-fold more potent than imiquimod [98]. The mechanism of action is still studied, notably by Russo et al., which showed a higher concentration of this TLR7 agonist in the MIIC of pDC, the acidic compartment protonating and charging positively the compound [101]. SM-360320 is not only a potential treatment for hepatitis C [102] but also for colon cancer [103].",

The first generation was represented by TMX-101, which is a liquid formulation of imiquimod originally developed as alternative for BCG to produce a local immune response leading to antitumor activity but circumventing the use of live attenuated mycobacteria preventing side effects. Prepared for intravesical instillation of imiquimod and developed by UroGen Pharma (formerly TheraCoat), TMX-101 (Vesimune\u2122) was already tested for pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics [106] and was the subject of clinical trials [[107], [108], [109]]. TMX-202 (14, Fig. 8\n) is a second-generation SM-360320 prodrug, which conjugates the TLR7 ligand to a C12 phospholipid via a benzoic acid functional group [110]. Discovered through a collaboration with the University of California San Diego, TMX-202 has already successfully completed many in vivo studies. TMX-202 is safe and efficacious without causing excessive adverse effects and could be an alternative to imiquimod for the treatment of proliferative skin disorders [111]. It is in preclinical development for the topical treatment of skin cancers, bladder cancers, and other indications. TMX-302 and TMX-306 (15 and 16 respectively, Fig. 8) are PEGylated SM-360320 purine-like compounds characterized by TLR7 partial agonist activity. The clinical application of TMX-302 in lung disorders should be examined with caution because of its direct pro-inflammatory effects. TMX-306 seems to be comparatively more effective and safer, deserving further investigations in drug development particularly for silicosis. This third generation is focused on developing candidates for treating autoimmune diseases [112].",

Moreover, Diao et al. demonstrated that intratumoral SZU-101 injections can reduce both injected and distant tumors in the 4T1 murine breast tumor model by generation of systemic antitumor immunity [114].

Significant inhibition of B16 melanoma lung tumor metastasis was observed in mice receiving a single injection of 2 mg loxoribine at day 3 of tumor growth. The greatest inhibition (96%) corresponds to four injections of loxoribine on alternate days starting the day before tumor injection. The combination of loxoribine and IL-2 significantly greater inhibition of metastasis. As guanosine analogues display adjuvant activity in B cell systems, loxoribine was evaluated as adjuvant in a tumor protection model. Mice immunized with both irradiated tumor cells and loxoribine developed a significantly lower number of lung tumors when challenged by live B16 tumor cells, whereas mice injected with either vaccine or loxoribine alone were not protected [123]. Loxoribine was also tested in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia [[124], [125], [126]]. By this way, loxoribine may be useful in tumor therapy as an immunomodulator or as an adjuvant.",

GS-9620 was administered to HBV infected three chimpanzees for 8 weeks with an interval of 1 week [145]. Consequently, serum concentrations of HBV surface antigen and HBV antigen, and the number of HBV antigen\u2013positive hepatocytes, were decreased as hepatocyte apoptosis increased. In a phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of GS-9620, treatment of GS-9620 results in dose dependent increases in select cytokines, chemokines, and ISGs beginning at 2 mg and is safe in a single dose up to 12 mg. Increases in percentages of immunocytes, like T cells, B cells and NK cells, expressing CD69 were also noted in subjects receiving GS-9620 treatment [[146], [147], [148]]. A dose-dependent pharmacodynamic induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) was demonstrated without a significant systemic induction of IFN\u03b1 expression or related symptoms.

It was also demonstrated that GS-9620 induced HIV RNA expression ex vivo in PBMC isolated from patients on suppressive antiretroviral therapy [[152], [153], [154]]. Although GS-9620 was inactive against HIV in purified CD4+ T cells and macrophages, HIV replication was potently inhibited by conditioned medium derived from GS-9620-treated pDC cultures when added to CD4+ T cells prior to infection. GS-9620-treated PBMCs primarily showed increased production of IFN-\u03b1, and cotreatment with IFN-\u03b1-blocking antibodies reversed the HIV-1-inhibitory effect of GS-9620. Supplementary studies demonstrated that GS-9620 inhibited a post-entry event in HIV replication at a step coincident with or prior to reverse transcription. GS-9620 induced phagocytic cell maturation and improved effector-mediated killing of HIV-infected CD4 T cells by the HIV envelope-specific broadly neutralizing antibody PGT121. All data show that the compound enhanced antibody-mediated clearance of HIV-infected cells by improving immune effector functions targeting specifically those cells. GS-9620 is under clinical evaluation for reducing latent reservoirs in virally suppressed HIV-infected patients. The viral reservoir in latently infected cells is responsible for viral rebound in the vast majority of HIV-1-infected individuals who stop taking antiretroviral therapy. The key challenge to cure for HIV-1 infection is represented by the more extensively studied therapeutic strategies known as \u201cShock and kill\u201d. These strategies are aimed toward the reactivation of the latent reservoir using a latency-reversal agent (LRA) with the subsequent killing of the reactivated cell either by the cytotoxic arm of the immune system, including NK and CD8 T cells, or by viral cytopathic mechanisms [155,156]. Borducchi et al. show that administration of the V3 glycan-dependent bNAb PGT121 together with GS-9620 during ART delayed viral rebound following discontinuation of ART in simian\u2013human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-SF162P3-infected rhesus monkeys in which ART was initiated during early acute infection [157]. More contrasted results were obtained by Del Prete et al. [158] GS-986, another structurally-unpublished TLR7 agonist, was also evaluated to reduce latent reservoir in SIV-infected rhesus monkeys [159].",

It maintains embryonic stem cell self-renewal in the absence of feeder cells and exogenous factors. Long-term SC1-expanded murine embryonic stem cells can be differentiated into cells of the three primary germ layers in vitro and also can generate chimeric mice and contribute to the germ line in vivo [161]. Intravenously administered SC1 mediates systemic release of type I IFN, but not of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF\u03b1 and IL6, and results in activation of circulating immune cells. Intratumoral CD8+ T cells and CD11b + are significantly increased, pDCs are strongly activated and macrophages are M1 phenotype polarized, whereas myeloid-derived suppressor cells are decreased. SC1 prevents spontaneous lung metastasis, retards tumor growth, results in tumor rejection, prolongs survival and, most importantly, protects from tumor rechallenge, as demonstrated by Vascotto et al. in melanoma and colorectal cancer tumor models. SC1 treatment of mice inhibits the growth of established syngeneic tumors and results in significantly prolonged survival. Tumor-free mice treated with SC1 are protected from subsequent tumor rechallenge [162,163]. SC1 is also efficient in preventing lung metastases in a pulmonary metastatic Renca model [164]. Mice bearing the NK cell-sensitive lymphoma RMA-S are cured by repeated s. c. SC1 administrations as efficiently as with resiquimod. No relevant toxicities were observed. Mechanistically, SC1 reverses NK cell anergy and restores NK cell-mediated tumor cell killing in an IFN-dependent manner [165]. SC-2 (unpublished structure) is a dual-specific TLRs 7/8 agonist which displays a more pronounced pro-inflammatory cytokines release than SC-1. Additional experiments showed a significant up-regulation of activation marker CD69 on NK cells and increased cytolytic activity of peripheral blood cells [164].",

By coordinated activation of TLR8 and NLRP3, VTX-2337 activates NK cells and augments ADCC [166,167]. When treated with VTX-2337, TLR8 stimulates TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12 production at lower concentrations in human PBMCs. It also induces TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12 secretion from monocytes and myeloid DCs through the NF-\u03baB pathway. IFN\u03b3 secretion was observed when NK cells were treated with VTX-2337, which can enhance the lytic capability and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity of NK cells. VTX-2337 also improves the efficacy of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in treatment of ovarian cancer in a mouse model with humanized immune system that has been reconstituted with human CD34+ cells. This compound is evaluated for treatment of a variety of cancers, including head and neck cancer, colorectal, pancreatic, melanoma, breast, renal cell carcinoma, non small\u2013cell lung carcinoma, and other solid neoplasms. Evaluated as a stand-alone drug for treatment of lymphoma, VTX-2337 was essentially used in combination with other drugs [166,168]. Thanks to its potential immunostimulating and anticancer activities, VTX-2337 is currently under clinical development as an immunotherapy for multiple oncology indications such as ovarian cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck [169].

The presence of an alkyl or hydroxyalkyl chain at R1 position and no substitution at R2 show good IFN induction in human PBMCs (Fig. 21\n). However, the activity is not improved compared to the unsubstituted compound at R1. When longer alkyl chains (heptyl or more) or bulkier alkyl substituents (i.e., tert-butyl) are considered at R1, the activity is abolished. The activity is also lost when a phenyl group is directly linked to the R1 position. The substitution by an alkyl group at the R2 position improves the IFN induction for small chains, butyl bringing the better activity (MEC = 0.01 \u03bcg/mL or 0.05 \u03bcg/mL for butyl (40) or pentyl (41) respectively). Phenoxymethyl and benzyl groups at R2 also increase activity. The amine in C4 position is essential for the activity. All other modifications on this position rule out the IFN production. Overall, a simple substitution on the benzene ring appears to be detrimental since most of the synthesized compounds are not efficient in inducing IFN. However, C7-substituted compounds preserve the activity of the unsubstituted scaffold.",

The in vitro immunostimulatory activities of CL075-PS on human newborn and adult monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) were benchmarked against conventional adjuvants and human vaccines, including the live attenuated BCG vaccine, which elicits moderate TH1 immunity in neonates and is safe and effective at birth. Compared with BCG, CL075-PS induced greater production of IL-12p70, a cytokine that enhances TH1-polarized immune responses and promotes cytotoxic T-cell proliferation and survival. Considering all their results, Dowing et al. suggest a strong potential for CL075-PS to serve as a dual antigen/adjuvant vaccine delivery system for human neonatal vaccines.",

Even if 3M \u2212 052 is retained at the sight of injection limiting systemic exposure upon intratumoral administration, it also generated systemic antitumor immunity. The agonist is able to suppress not only both injected and distant uninjected wild-type poorly immunogenic B16\u2013F10 melanomas in mice, but also in the more immunogenic version B16.OVA melanoma. Treated tumors showed increased level of CCL2 chemokines and infiltration of M1 phenotype-shifted macrophages, which could kill tumor cells directly through production of nitric oxide and CCL2. 3M \u2212 052 therapy potentiated checkpoint blockade therapy (with anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies), that was also confirmed by Mullins et al. [238] Zhao et al. showed that combining 3M \u2212 052 with CpG ODN increases cytotoxic T cell activity and Th1 cytokine production while downregulating the activity of immunosuppressing myeloid derived suppressor cells. This combination allows tumor suppression in CT26 colon cancer bearing mice and establishment of long-term immunity [239]. In 2017, Hoeven et al. described 3M-052 formulation development studies [240]. The hydrophobicity of 3M \u2212 052 allows its incorporation in lipid-based formulations (anionic, cationic, PEGylated or neutral liposomes or oil-in-water emulsion), which were able to protect both mice and ferrets from infections caused by lethal H5N1 homologous virus. Furthermore, they demonstrated the ability of 3M-052 adjuvant formulations to broaden responses to H5N1 hemagglutinin-based antigens.",

Based on these data, Shukla et al. hypothesized that the C2 ethylaminomethylene substituent of the gardiquimod brings sufficient polarity to prevent its efficient transcutaneous penetration and stimulation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Hydrophobic analogues of gardiquimod were later synthesized and their TLR7 and TLR8 agonist activities were studied using HEK293 cells expressing either TLR7 or TLR8 [247]. Compounds with modifications of the secondary amine at the C2 position are not convenient to keep the agonist activity. Replacing the imidazole ring with a triazole ring leads to a total loss of activity. The 4-amino group is absolutely necessary to obtain maximum activity. In a series of synthesized lipophilic compounds carrying a benzyl group in the N1 position and a C2 alkyl chain show a link between the length of the alkyl chain and the TLR7 agonist activity. The optimal activity was observed for compound 47 carrying a C2 butyl chain (Fig. 24) with a minimum effective concentration at which IFN induction was observed of 0.5 \u03bcg/mL as suggested by Gerster et al. [224] The rearrangement of the substituents in N1 and C2 of gardiquimod and of compound 47 leads to the identification of the highly active compound 48, agonist TLR7 with an EC50 of 8.6 nM (Fig. 24). These compounds are selective for TLR7 without any agonistic activity for TLR8.",

They showed that the elimination of the C2 ethoxymethyl chain of resiquimod results in a significant decrease in the TLR7 agonist activity and a complete loss of the TLR8 agonist activity. The activity is restored and even improved, by the addition of a butyl chain in C2 position (EC50 TLR7 = 0.1 \u00b1 0.02 \u03bcM, EC50 TLR8 = 0.1 \u00b1 0.003 \u03bcM). The unsubstituted in C2 position and carrying a methoxycarbonyl group in C7 position compound lacked TLRs 7/8 agonist activity, however, it was able to induce a high production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF\u03b1, IL12, IL1\u03b2). This suggests the existence of an alternative mechanism of action by which imidazoquinolines can stimulate the production of cytokines. The addition of the alkyl (butyl) chain in C2 position restored TLR7 and TLR8 agonist activity. All this indicates that C7 substitution may be important for cytokine production, whereas TLRs 7/8 agonist activity requires C2 substitution.",

Several studies using TLR-deficient mice have investigated the role of TLRs 7, 8 and 9 in the development of SLE in mice prone to lupus.

            "text": "The role of TLR8 in autoimmune diseases has not been extensively studied, perhaps because of a lack of response to TLR8 ligands in murine models. There is a difference in the response immune profile after TLR 7 or TLR8 stimulation [37]. TLR7 responses are characterized by a high production of type I IFNs such as IFN\u03b1, which appears to play a major role in autoimmune diseases, while TLR8 stimulates very low levels of IFN\u03b1 but induces a strong production of other pro-inflammatory cytokines [62,256,291]. However, TNF\u03b1 produced during TLR8 activation may exert pro-inflammatory effects in autoimmune diseases [292,293]. TLR8 being stimulated by ribonucleoproteins [294] and TLR8 mRNA over-regulated in patients with Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome [295] indicates a possible role of TLR8 in autoimmune processes. In psoriasis, a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease of the skin, extracellular RNA forms complexes with the cationic antimicrobial peptide LL37. These complexes are highly protected against degradation of RNAs and have access to the endosomal compartments of pDCs and mDCs. The RNA-LL37 complexes induce the activation of TLR7 in PDCs and trigger IFN\u03b1 secretion. RNA-LL37 complexes also trigger direct activation of mDCs to secrete TNF\u03b1 and IL6 and differentiate into mature dendritic cells. This maturation of MDCs is triggered by endosomal TLR8 and is enhanced by the concomitant activation of pDCs to produce IFN\u03b1. These data identify RNA-LL37 complexes as endogenous triggers of TLR7 and TLR8 in human dendritic cells thus leading to the development of psoriasis [296].",

In 2010, Cherfils-Vicini et al. have shown that TLR7 and TLR8 are highly expressed on primary tumor cells of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Additionally to the chemoresistance in patients with NSCLC, TLR7 agonist induce an important protumurogenic effect in vitro [297]. These effects were also verified in immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) and immunocompetent (C57BL/6) murine models, using subcutaneously grafted lung carcinoma cells [298]. In both models, the repeated administration of TLR7 agonists, such as CL264, loxoribine or imiquimod resulted in increased tumor volume. This protumorigenic effect could be mediated by direct stimulation of tumor cells expressing TLR7 or by increased recruitment and differentiation of immunosuppressive cells into the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, research teams find similar results in various tumor models. Stimulation of TLR7 in a pancreatic cancer model expressing TLR7 induces tumor growth acceleration and reduction in antitumor molecules expression [299,300]. Similarly, TLR7 stimulation in hepatocellular carcinoma model expressing TLR7 boost malignant cells proliferation [301].",

HIV ssRNA is a potent immune activator that triggers TLR7-mediated signaling. The HIV virus itself directly contributes to the activation of the immune system and its dysfunction by stimulating TLR7 [302]. Recent studies have shown that activation of TLR7 in human CD4+ T cells triggers an anergic state that may contribute to CD4+ T cell hyporeactivity after infection with HIV-1 and may also increase the spread of this virus. This unexpected role of TLR7, whose activation facilitates infection of CD4+ T cells by HIV-1, was blocked using a TLR7 inhibitor. The presence of this inhibitor has led to an attenuation of the infection. The authors concluded that HIV-1 use the anergic state induced by TLR7 activation to support its own spread [303].",

Docking studies reveal that CU-CPT8m is sandwiched between the two monomers of TLR8 and is localized in a hydrophobic pocket at the protein-protein interface of the two monomers TLR8. This new binding site is close, but distinct from the identified agonist site, whose occupation prevents the activation of TLR8. This implies a new inhibitory mechanism by CU-CPT8m.",

By blocking the newly identified site, these TLR8 inhibitors appear to antagonize the binding of TLR8 agonists such as R848 and uridine, and/or block a conformational change necessary for the receptor activation. In addition, authors explored the effects of CU-CPT8m and CU-CPT9a in human samples from various patients with inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The study showed that treatment with CU-CPT9a has potent anti-inflammatory effects in the samples of patients with osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and adult Still\u2019s disease, thus confirming previously published work showing that TLR8 may play a role in inflammatory disorders and autoimmune diseases.",

Other mechanisms include inhibition of MAPK signaling and phospholipase A2, antiproliferation, photoprotection as well as reduction of matrix metalloproteinase-9 activities [[309], [310], [311], [312]]. All these mechanisms of action highlight the anti-inflammatory and immuno-suppressive activity of this antimalarial drugs by acting on endosomal TLR signaling (TLRs 7/8/9). Moreover, CQ was under investigation for diseases associated with uncontrolled acute or chronic inflammation (severe sepsis [313]), to prevent and treat viral infections (HIV, influenza, and dengue) [314,315], cardiovascular diseases [316] or cancer by notably modulating autophagy [317].

These compounds have been tested for their TLR7 or TLR8 agonistic and antagonistic activities. Several of them are shown to be selective TLR7 antagonists without any TLR7 or TLR8 agonistic activity. The selectivity was confirmed by a comparative ligand-docking study suggesting a specific binding mode in a novel TLR7 antagonist site. Two compounds of the pyrazolo[1,5-a]quinoxaline series (76 and 77, IC50 = 8.2 and 10.0 \u03bcM respectively, Fig. 40\n) are potent selective TLR7 antagonists and may be considered as promising starting points for further rational development of low molecular TLRs 7/8 ligands.",

SM934 possesses better bioavailability and better immunosuppressive activity than traditional arteminisin derivatives, and displays antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory properties [324,325]. In vitro, SM934 inhibited IFN\u03b3 and IL-17 production from polyclonal CD4+ T cells activated by T cell receptor engagement and the differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells into Th1 and Th17 cells, but not Treg cells. Ex vivo, SM934 treatment elevated the percentage of Treg cells, impeded the comprehensive activation of STAT-1, STAT-3, and STAT-5 proteins in splenocytes, suppressed the TLR-triggered activation and proliferation of B cells, as well as antibody secretion. SM934 interfered with the B-cell intrinsic pathway by downregulating TLRs 7/9 mRNA expression, MyD88 protein expression and NF-\u03ba\u03b2 phosphorylation. Studies have shown the therapeutic effects of the orally administered SM934 on lupus-prone MRL/lpr mice by inhibiting Th1 and Th17 cell responses suppressing the B cell activation and plasma cell production, ameliorating proteinurea and renal lesion severity. SM934 exhibited protective effects in two mouse models of SLE, MRL/lpr and NZB/W F1 mice by suppressing pathogenic T-cell development [[326], [327], [328]]. On a murine model of Multiple Sclerosis (EAE), SM934 is able to stop the progression and to reverse the clinical and histopathological signs, via modulating the balance of T cell subsets, especially by promoting Treg cell generation [329]. On the collagen-induced arthritis in DBA/1 mice, SM934 ameliorated the severity of arthritis by inhibiting development of Tfh and Th17 cells as well as autoantibodies production. SM934 could prohibit the IL-21-mediated signaling pathway by preventing the activation of STAT3 [330].",

As confirmed by in vitro studies, cell imaging and co-immunoprecipitation, 2R9 binds TIRAP with nanomolar affinity as a result of a fast association rate coupled with slow dissociation of the complex. 2R9 binds albumin with micromolar affinity. 2R9 diminished systemic cytokine responses elicited in vivo by synthetic TLR2 and TLR7 agonists. It inhibited the activation of macrophages infected with influenza strain A/PR/8/34 (PR8) and significantly improved the survival of PR8-infected mice.

IRS-954 treatment showed a reduction of serum levels of nucleic-acid specific autoantibodies and improvement of disease symptoms in lupus-prone mice (decrease of proteinurea, glomerulonephritis and end-organ damage) resulting in an increasing survival [357]. IRS-954 could also reverse TLR7/9-mediated glucocorticoid resistance of SLE, and thus could be potentially used as corticosteroid-sparing drug [358].

Among the three FDA or EMA-approved TLR agonists, only one of them targets a TLR which is discussed in this review: the TLR7 agonist imiquimod. Regarding others, BCG is agonist of TLRs 2/3/4 and possibly 9, and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) is agonist of TLR 4. Indeed, despite efforts from researchers, few pharmacological modulators reach final stages of clinical studies either as drugs or as adjuvants, due to obstacles that are difficult to overcome. For example, toxicity related to immunomodulating compounds could be modulated by delivering potent therapies locally (intratumorally or intradermally) thus directly targeting pathological sites and/or cell populations [369]. Moreover, animal models do not reflect exactly the human immunological pathways, which did not allow appreciating the potentialities of certain compounds. With less genetic variability in animal models, a margin of error is possible to predict safety but active doses in humans. Specific molecular alterations or mutations due to the evolution of pathologies could also prevent potent modulators to mediate the expected therapeutic effect, in addition of host-related characteristics, such as gender, age or gene polymorphic variants.

Continuing researches around TLR biology would allow finding novel therapies to address unmet medical needs, such as cancers, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and chronic neuropathic pain.",
