Geneticin, for example, has been shown to inhibit pestivirus assembly 31 or release and the replication or translation of flaviviruses. 32 Even though these viruses belong to the same family (Flaviviridae), they are inhibited by two different mechanisms. We demonstrate here that, unlike the case for HIV and coronaviruses, LCTA-949 inhibits HCV replication at a post-entry event. Indeed, the molecule inhibits the replication of HCV subgenomic replicons (which do not encode structural proteins) and the activity in replicons is comparable to that in the infectious HCV system. Furthermore, LCTA-949 is still active when added to HCV-infected cultures. Whether inhibition of intracellular replication is the result of a direct interaction with viral proteins or is mediated by interference with host cell factors remains to be elucidated. So far, we have not been able to select drug-resistant variants despite several months of attempts. Interestingly, oritavancin has been shown to interfere with intracellular cholesterol and phospholipid metabolism 33 and membrane organization and permeability. 34 Both host cell lipid metabolism 35 and membrane organization 36 are important during HCV replication. It is thus possible that LCTA-949 might (i) target cellular factor(s) that is (are) essential for HCV replication or (ii) influence the cell's lipid metabolism in such a way that it counteracts HCV replication or disturbs membrane organization, which is important in the HCV replication cycle.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 97, "end": 100, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 101, "end": 103, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 167, "end": 169, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 381, "end": 383, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 447, "end": 449, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1365, "end": 1367, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1412, "end": 1414, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1447, "end": 1449, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In the subgenomic replicon model, LCTA-949 was more efficient in clearing cells of their HCV replicons than NS3 protease or NS5B polymerase inhibitors at the concentration tested ( Figure 5 ). Future HCV therapy will consist of a combination of two or more selective inhibitors. 37 In line with this, we aimed to study the combined effect of LCTA-949 with either IFN or other HCV inhibitors (protease or polymerase inhibitors). Each of the combinations resulted in an overall additive antiviral effect ( Figure 4) . Hence, these compounds probably do not interfere with the mechanism of action of these selective inhibitors. This is further supported by the observation that LCTA-949 was equipotent against wild-type replicons and replicons resistant to various inhibitors of NS3 protease or nucleoside or nonnucleoside NS5B polymerase. LCTA-949 delayed or prevented resistance development (of replicons) to the protease inhibitor VX-950. More importantly, even after 4 months of continuous culture in the presence of a suboptimal concentration of LCTA-949, no HCV replicons with reduced susceptibility to LCTA-949 emerged. The barrier to resistance of this class of compounds might therefore be high, assuming that the HCV quasispecies is equally diverse in vitro and in vivo.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 279, "end": 281, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 181, "end": 189, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 504, "end": 513, "text": "Figure 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In conclusion, an aglycone analogue(s) of teicoplanin inhibit(s) in vitro HCV replication and in particular is (are) potent in clearing hepatoma cells of their replicons.
