There are fields within biology that require a working definition of life for publishing (Cleland and Chyba, 2002). For example, exobiology is concerned with the study of life beyond the Earth, but the search for extraterrestrial life needs to distinguish between inanimate and living entities (Oliver and Perry, 2006). When studying the origin of life, researchers can use model chemical systems to simulate how life may have begun on the Earth. Some definition of life is needed to show the transition from inanimate molecules to biological systems (van Hateren, 2013). Finally, the field of artificial life (Alife) aims to fully simulate living organisms electronically. Researchers in this field need a definition of life to understand what properties are essential for something to be living and thus improve their simulations (Machery, 2012).",

Since we are still discovering new species and have competing hypotheses for how life originated, many feel that the issue of defining the concept of \u2018life\u2019 is a worthless pursuit as we do not understand enough about it (Raoult, 2009; Szostak, 2012).",

This immediately excluded viruses and all non-cellular life forms (which at the time had not been discovered) from the definition. As cell theory became universally accepted, the definition of life being strictly cellular was also accepted (Wolfe, 1972).",

This is analogous to the organization of organs in multicellular organisms. This definition also conforms to the tenets of cell theory even though Lwoff was himself a virologist.

Program refers to coding molecules, Improvization refers to evolution, Compartmentalization means organized in some sort of structure, Energy refers to metabolism, Regeneration means some sort of healing process, Adaptability means changing according to the environment and Seclusion is being able to protect against the environment. This definition was well received by his contemporaries as each of these criteria allow for flexibility, meaning that it is usable in a variety of contexts (Zhuravlev and Avetiso, 2006). However, it was criticized by origin-of-life researchers as these criteria were absent or had no equivalent when looking at early primordial life (Zhuravlev and Avetiso, 2006).",

Instead of defining life descriptively, he took all the varying definitions of life (123 in his study) and by looking at the common vocabulary he synthesized a consensus definition: \u2018Self-replication with variation\u2019 (Trifonov, 2011), which happened to be almost exactly the same as a definition by the Russian biochemist and origin-of-life researcher Oparin in 1924: \u2018Any system capable of replication and mutation is alive\u2019 (Oparin, 1924). This novel approach sidestepped the history and debate of defining life and attempted to find common ground within the Biological disciplines. Regardless of older conventions such as cell theory, Trifonov also stated that this approach would be able to define all life, including artificial and extraterrestrial life, by looking at common characteristics (Trifonov, 2012).",

For example, homoeostasis and metabolism were missing and the definition included viruses and computer viruses (Trifonov, 2012). Moreover, there was no reference to the cell, which also invited criticisms from many fields (Trifonov, 2012). Trifonov was criticized for focussing his definition on the origins of life and not on what distinguishes life from non-life (Trifonov, 2012). He wrote considerably on experiments with self-replicating RNA in his paper (Trifonov, 2011), which led to critics to suggest that this was a more Earth-centric practical definition rather than a holistic one (Trifonov, 2012). Trifonov himself partially showed this as he envisaged later molecular origin-of-life experiments to prove this definition and approach (Trifonov, 2011). He also pointed to a practical use for this definition for molecular experiments such as GCCn repeats replication errors in the origin-of-life field (Pino, Trifonov and Di Mauro, 2011). More noticeable is the fact that Trifonov\u2019s definition is almost exactly the same as that of Alexander Oparin, who proposed the Oparin\u2013Haldane hypothesis for how the early atmosphere could have produced molecules leading to life (Oparin, 1924). As a consequence, critics were sceptical of his claim that this approach could be used universally (Popa, 2012).",

Many advances in science have come from challenging past conventional wisdom and this approach may not represent competing viewpoints in fast moving fields (Popa, 2012). There are still competing hypotheses for the origin of life (Altstein, 2015) and so this approach could not represent all viewpoints, only the hypothesis that received the most attention in the literature (Popa, 2012). There were also many minor criticisms of his methodology as Trifonov grouped together words with similar meaning (Trifonov, 2012). The classification of these groups invited controversy notably from biochemists, who argued that metabolism should be grouped in the \u2018System\u2019 and not \u2018Chemical\u2019 category (Trifonov, 2012). There were also criticisms of the words within the groups, for example, \u2018force\u2019 and \u2018energy\u2019 were grouped together and so were \u2018replication\u2019 and \u2018self-reproduction\u2019 (Trifonov, 2012). Many critics pointed out that these had different definitions and that grouping them together made the overall definition less accurate (Trifonov, 2012). Trifonov did acknowledge their concerns but stressed that there had to be some middle ground otherwise no consensus would be reached (Trifonov, 2012). Moreover, as all these definitions were synthesized at different times, they were based on varying levels of knowledge about life. This meant that many definitions were outdated or had later been made redundant and diluted the more knowledgeable recent definitions (Trifonov, 2012), especially when considering artificial life, knowledge of which is far more recent.",

            "text": "The first hurdle is what type of definition should be used? If a stipulative or descriptive definition is used there is a long list of criteria each with its own exceptions. Ultimately this leads to either a very strict definition with each criterion sieving out some undeniably living organisms or a broad definition that includes fire or crystals as living (Oliver and Perry, 2006). There are difficulties with a theoretical definition as this requires a robust theory of living organisms that we do not yet have. Biologists are asking for a definition that can (i) apply to all life forms across the past, present and future, (ii) be descriptive enough to discriminate between ambiguous cases on a case-by-case basis without any counterexamples, (iii) state the universal but essential elements of all life forms and (iv) be linguistically unambiguous (Zhuravlev and Avetiso, 2006). No definition to date can fulfil these criteria. As an example, Joyce\u2019s definition described above as \u2018a self-sustained chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution\u2019 excludes sterile hybrids as they are not capable of Darwinian evolution since they cannot replicate. The term \u2018self-sustaining\u2019 has implications, as a lone sexually reproducing organism is treated as not living, whereas a mating pair is (Koshland, 2002). Therefore, lone sexually reproducing organisms cannot be considered as self-sustaining. Chemical systems can also be capable of error prone reproduction but need constant monitoring so cannot be self-sustaining (Benner, 2010). However for origin-of-life researchers, these systems are considered as living. Finally, it is problematic from a practical standpoint to determine whether a system is capable of Darwinian evolution as this requires studies over many generations and under different selection pressures (Oliver and Perry, 2006).",

In the first instance, we assume that people\u2019s collective judgements on what is living or not can lead to a definition. However there is a strong evidence both in psychology and empirically that folk concepts are not strict definitions and that people\u2019s collective judgements are too contradictory to lead to one definition (Machery, 2012). In this case, Machery argues that trying to define life is impossible. Treating life as a theoretical concept is also problematic as different fields try to define life according to an agenda. Figure 1 illustrates this problem as this leads to varying working definitions of life that aid one field but with little or no overlap with others (Machery, 2012). In this case, defining life universally is unnecessary as there are practical definitions already available.",

We are trying to describe a process having only seen it start once (Cleland and Chyba, 2002), such that all life on the Earth had one common origin and possibly one last universal common ancestor (LUCA).

The virologist Andre Lwoff observed that viruses transform the whole infected cell into a virion factory (Lwoff, 1967). The virion factory (also called viroplasm or virus induced inclusion bodies) is the apparatus where new viral particles are assembled in the host and can be seen as a large organelle-like structure in the cytoplasm or nucleus (Neuman, Angelini and Buchmeier, 2014; Risco, Fernandez and Sanz-Sanchez, 2014). Virion factories usually have single or double membranes either taken from the host plasma membrane or made from lipids redirected from the endoplasmic reticulum (Neuman, Angelini and Buchmeier, 2014; Risco, Fernandez and Sanz-Sanchez, 2014). Virion factories show properties of cellular life such as \u2018metabolism, growth and reproduction\u2019. Therefore, life is effectively present (Bandea, 1983). In this view, the extracellular virions are inert but the intracellular virus seen as a virion factory is living (Bandea, 1983). When this argument was first proposed in 1983, it was largely rejected by the scientific community as a biased attempt by virologists to classify their studied organism as living (Forterre, 2010).",

            "text": "This virus had some novel characteristics that had previously only been found in cellular organisms. First, it was bigger than many cellular organisms in diameter (750 nm) and was the first to be visible under a light microscope. Its genome was large too at 1.2 Mb and with 911 functional protein coding genes, far beyond that needed for a viral life cycle (Claverie, 2006). Since viruses need only code for their own capsid, receptors for host entry and hijacking the cell, they had not been expected to carry more than around 200 genes (Claverie, 2006). Moreover, viral genomes are limited by the structural instability of large amounts of naked DNA. This suggests that the virus was using other genes for purposes other than a typical viral life cycle, otherwise these extra genes would have been lost through evolution (Claverie, 2006). The non-coding regions were also interesting as they had unique and strongly conserved promotor elements, hinting to the fact that this was a part of a long lineage existing at the same time as the first cells (Claverie and Abergel, 2009). This notion is supported by more recent proteome analysis that concluded that viruses originated from ancient cells that had segmented RNA genomes (Nasir and Caetano-Anoll\u00e9s, 2015). These RNA cells coexisted with the ancestors of the last universal modern ancestor (LUCA). Due to the selection pressure of genome and particle sizes these RNA cells eventually became viruses and became similar to parasitic bacteria that had similar pressures (Nasir and Caetano-Anoll\u00e9s, 2015). The nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses which include the mimivirus form one paraphyletic group that diverged at varying times before the emergence of modern Archaea and Eukaryotes (Nasir and Caetano-Anoll\u00e9s, 2015).",

In fact, the mimivirus viral factory is membrane bound and can take up huge volumes inside the cell, setting it apart from other viral factories (Forterre, 2010). This rekindled the argument made by Bandea (Bandea, 1983), emphasizing the fact that the viral factory is the virus organism itself, with the virions that are produced being vectors for this organism to be spread to other cells (Claverie, 2006). This argument was extended to say that during the life cycle the whole infected cell becomes a virus and because of this we should consider viruses as both living and \u2018a particular form of cellular organism\u2019 (Forterre, 2010), with the proviso that they borrow from the cell they infect. The virion factory is also very similar to some intracellular parasitic bacteria such as Rickettsia buchnera, which also depend on the host metabolism to reproduce and are unanimously counted as living (Nasir and Caetano-Anoll\u00e9s, 2015). This metaphor can be extended to say that the virion and a host can be viewed as two gametes that fuse to create the virion factory, which then creates more virion progeny (Nasir and Caetano-Anoll\u00e9s, 2015). This metaphor has been used to depict viruses as living (Hegde et al., 2009).",

The sputnik virophage requires coinfection with the mimivirus and both reduce the overall mimivirus particles created by 70% and increases the number of dysfunctional and misshapen mimiviruses (La Scola, Desnues and Pagnier, 2008). It acts like any other virus, using the enzymes in the mimivirus factory for its own replication (Desnues and Raoult, 2010). This implies that the mimivirus is functionally similar to a cellular organism as it can be infected by a virus (Claverie and Abergel, 2009).

Schulz suggested that the giant virus family had originated from smaller viruses by gradually accumulating host genes and not from an ancient cellular ancestor (Schulz, 2017). Translation-related genes were advantageous as the host could shut down their own translational apparatus as an antiviral response (Schulz, 2017). Another notable giant virus discovery is the Turpanvirus, which was found in Brazil and had all the translational machinery required apart from the ribosome.

There are some strongly supported phylogenetic trees that put the NCLDVs between Eukaryotes and archaea in a fourth domain (Br\u00fcssow, 2009; Boyer et al. 2010). It has also been noted that traditional phylogenies were based on ribosomal proteins and were not representative of life as they precluded viruses (Boyer et al. 2010; Forterre, 2010).

Two virologists proposed a new classification with the highest division being between organisms containing ribosomes and those containing capsids (Forterre, 2010). Subviral entities like plasmids, prions and viroids (Kejnovskya and Trifonov, 2016) were grouped together as \u2018orphan replicons\u2019 but separate from this tree (Forterre, 2010). However, this overhaul of taxonomy led to criticism that it was a stunt to gain more academic attention and an ungrounded attempt to class viruses as living. There were other issues such that all ribosome-encoding organisms contained common rRNA proteins but there was no protein universally shared in the capsid-encoding organisms (Forterre, 2010). The authors acknowledged that this would incite controversy but emphasized the need to promote more academic debate on this subject (Forterre, 2010).",
