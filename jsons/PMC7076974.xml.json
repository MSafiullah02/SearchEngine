Abnormally high ScvO2 values have been related to higher mortality in septic shock patients [4], while lactate clearance has proved to be as beneficial as the ScvO2 in the hemodynamic management of sepsis. However, when clinicians face the uncertainty of a high lactate value, they have to identify whether it indicates persistent hypoperfusion or whether it will eventually normalize. Therefore, normalized ScvO2 values and lactate values do not rule out persistent hypoxia and hypoperfusion during initial resuscitation.",

Under steady states of both CO2 production and oxygen consumption, the gapCO2 was observed to be increased in parallel with the reduction in cardiac output [9]. However, spontaneous breathing and hyperventilation may reduce the partial pressure of CO2 in arteries (PaCO2) and prevent the CO2 stagnation-induced rise in central venous carbon dioxide pressure (PvCO2). Mallat et al. demonstrated that acute hyperventilation provoked a significant increase in gapCO2 and oxygen consumption (VO2) [10]. To date, little is known about the gapCO2 and respiratory rate (RR) in septic shock patients undergoing volume mechanical ventilation. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the underlying effect of the RR on the gapCO2 in septic shock patients undergoing volume mechanical ventilation.",

Our results showed that the PcvCO2 and PaCO2 decreased with an increasing respiratory rate, and this difference was statistically significant. However, the decreasing trend of the PaCO2 was more obvious than that of the PcvCO2. Consequently, the difference in the gapCO2 values when the RR varied from 10 to 16 breaths/min was significant.

            "text": "The combination of oxygen and hemoglobin can promote the release of CO2. Furthermore, CO2 more easily combines with hemoglobin at lower oxygen saturation, which is a phenomenon called the Haldane effect [15]. Clearly an increase in alveolar ventilation increases CO2 excretion and alveolar PaO2. Increased alveolar ventilation causes respiratory alkalosis with immediate changes in hydrogen ion concentrations and bicarbonate concentrations. There are transcellular shifts with H ions coming out cells into the plasma and shifts of potassium from the plasma into cells. Renal compensation with bicarbonate excretion takes hours. Nevertheless, respiratory alkalosis can cause peripheral vasoconstriction and decreased flow through the various vascular beds. This is probably not a uniform effect in all vessels and may or may not occur in patients with sepsis. However, if blood flow decreases but metabolism is unchanged, then the CO2 content of venous blood should increase, leading to a higher gapCO2. If patients with sepsis have disordered cellular metabolism, then the production CO2 may decrease, which in turn results in a lower gapCO2. Furthermore, the depression of oxidative adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production also led to pulmonary vasoconstriction [16]. Nitric oxide synthesis defect has shown to be another cause [17]. As a consequence, the reducing trend of the CO2 partial pressure of venous blood is less marked than that of arterial blood. This has been demonstrated by other scholars as well [18]. The increase in alveolar ventilation increases CO2 excretion and should increase the alveolar PaO2 provided other factors stay the same. Increased alveolar ventilation causes respiratory alkalosis with immediate changes in hydrogen ion concentrations and bicarbonate concentrations. There should be transcellular shifts with hydrogen ion coming out cells into the plasma and shifts of potassium from the plasma into cells. Respiratory alkalosis can cause peripheral vasoconstriction and decreased flow through various vascular beds. This is probably not a uniform effect in all vessels and may or may not occur in patients with sepsis. However, if blood flow decreases but metabolism is unchanged, then the CO2 content of venous blood should increase, resulting in a gapCO2. If patients with sepsis have dysfunctional cellular metabolism, then the production CO2 may decrease, which would result in a lower gapCO2. This likely varies in the vascular bed from tissue to tissue. CO2 binding hemoglobin may not have an important effect in these experiments.",

Hence, when patients are in hypocapnia provoked by hyperventilation, the CO2 partial pressure of the venous blood does not obviously decrease compared with the CO2 partial pressure of the arterial blood. For instance, Khambatta et al. reported that mechanically ventilated dogs undergoing 2 h of hyperventilation had 20% CO2 production and 25% O2 consumption [20]. In this study, the ScvO2 significantly increased with the RR increase from 10 to 14 breaths/min, but there was no significant decreasing trend in ScvO2 between 14 and 16 breaths/min, which was consistent with a previous report [21]. Moreover, it is widely accepted that the gapCO2 depends on measurements from the superior vena cava (SVC) but does not reflect measurements from the inferior vena cava (IVC) and tissues draining into the IVC [22].",

Acidosis and excess CO2 can cause mitochondrial dysfunction [23, 24]. Metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis due to excessive hyperventilation further reduce the function of mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation, which may impact CO2 production. In summary, our data suggested that in septic patients with mechanical ventilation, respiratory alkalosis induced by hyperventilation enabled the increase of gapCO2. Clinicians should be cautious when interpreting the gapCO2 as low cardiac output and inadequate perfusion in hemodynamically stable ventilated septic shock patients.",
