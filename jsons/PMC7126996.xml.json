Annual donations reached 12.6 million in 2001, more than a 3-fold increase in less than 3 years, with an average rate of increase of 51% as shown in Figure 1\n[2], [8]. Despite the negative impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome on blood donations and transfusions in 2003, and the slow recovery in the following year, overall donations continued to increase by more than 10% during the next 5 years. This phase of rapid growth in donations ended in 2010. In the years since, units obtained by donation have remained relatively constant, but the rate of annual increase has fallen sharply, down to 1% to 2.4% since 2012.",

The World Health Organization estimates that a gross donation rate of no less than 1% to 3% of a population is required to meet their basic clinical transfusion demands [9]. However, the donation rate in China was barely 1% in 2015. Given the already low donation rate and the slow growth rate, the number of available blood units must continue to increase by at least 10% to meet the increasing demand for blood. According to the Year Books of Chinese Health released by the National Health and Family Planning Commission (equivalent to a Ministry of Health in other nations), the number of inpatient admissions to hospitals has been increasing at an annual rate of 11.48% or more since 2008 [2]. There is no doubt that the most urgent priority for blood services is to motivate new potential donors and to stimulate those who have historically donated to continue to donate on a regular basis. At the same time, researchers, policy makers, and practitioners of blood service society need to understand the underlying cause of the current slow rate of growth in annual blood collections.",

            "text": "Since the World Health Assembly released its resolution WHA 28.72 in 1975, which calls for member states to promote the development of national blood services based on VNRBD, this altruistically motivated form of donation has been proven to be the cornerstone for both safety and adequacy of blood supply globally (WHA Resolution 58.13, 2005) [10]. The World Health Organization defines VNRBD as a donation in which \u201ca person gives blood, plasma, or cellular components of his/her own free will and receives no payment for it, either in the form of cash, or in kind which could be considered a substitute for money. This would include time off work other than that reasonably needed for the donation and travel. Small tokens, refreshments, and reimbursements of direct travel costs are compatible with voluntary non-remunerated donation\u201d [11]. This definition has been adopted by almost all international organizations devoted to transfusion medicine and by most of national authorities. With this principle, donors do not receive direct benefits or repayment for blood donation in monetary form or its substitutes; the motivation is altruistic. Because of the deeply rooted traditional belief in the personal value of blood to one's own health, the general public in China does not intrinsically see benefit in taking time and effort to donate blood for unknown others without personal return. As a result, it was predictable that implementation of a system of blood donation based on altruistic motivation in China would result in an initial slow growth phase. It takes considerable effort to disseminate information on the importance of blood donation and transfusion and to build a case for altruistic donation practices. Once people have accepted the altruistic principle and become donors, naturally there will be high chances that they will remain regular donors. With more people accepting the altruistic principle, blood collection is expected to enter a sustainable growth phase with a steady increase in the number of blood donations. The authors believe this 2 phase growth pattern to be inevitable: a slowly growing initial phase followed by a sustainable growing phase. Time is also needed for blood services to become more efficient, and to eliminate spurious altruism or nonmonetary forms of compensation, which harm efforts to increase altruistic and voluntary donation [12]. In the long term, as has been proven globally, altruistic blood donation is expected to meet the demands of hospitals and patients. In contrast, blood donation based on personal incentives may be less sustainable and studies have suggested that personal incentives may reduce the number of blood donors in the long term [13], [14]. The anticipated effects of a blood donation system based on either altruistic motivation or on motivation by personal incentives are illustrated in Figure 2\n.",

The Law banned monetary compensations (previously termed \u201cnutrition fees\u201d) to donors by either the agencies collecting the blood or the patients receiving blood transfusion. The Blood Donation Law does allow some form of compensation for donors, however, in exchange for donation. For example, the law ensures that the donors, their spouses, and their immediate family members can receive blood transfusion at no cost. In cases where blood is in a short supply, donors and their families may be prioritized to receive blood that is available should they require transfusion. These privileges are referred to as the \u201cGive Blood Voluntarily and Use Blood for Free\u201d provision. The amount of blood that one shall donate to receive these benefits differs by regional regulations. In some places, a single unit donated enables the donor unlimited free transfusions throughout their lifetime. The waived costs are borne by the blood service facility that collected their blood originally. As shown in Figure 1, the rate of donation increased substantially over the initial 12 years of implementation, but has since slowed substantially. This trend is consistent with the biphasic trajectory of the benefit-driven mode of blood donation depicted with the predications by the authors as shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 3\n.",

It has led to the eradication of paid donation, while increasing donations 4-fold in less than 13 years (1998-2011). However, the free transfusions obtained in exchange by donations represent personal benefits and thus are inconsistent with the altruistic principles of VNRBD. It is apparent, by both theoretical analysis and the very real stagnation of blood donations China currently faces, that the Give Blood Voluntarily and Use Blood for Free model is not sustainable. The ability to provide sufficient blood will become increasingly constrained and will not keep pace with increasing demand for blood. The consequent impact on health services will be visible more often, from cases of surgery cancellations to the restriction on the overall development of health care system.",

Proposed benefits include quicker reimbursement for the costs of free transfusions prepaid by patients and extending the policy coverage of one donation for lifelong unlimited free transfusions [15], [16], [17]. It is not clear yet whether these proposals will bring in more donors, or whether any long-term increases in donation will be seen. Additional incentives will create a substantial new fiscal commitment by blood establishments that cannot be honored without a proportional commitment from Health authorities. Increasing the effectiveness of VNRBD requires disseminating the right messages, building cultural consciousness and societal awareness around voluntary donation, and eliminating any pretense that a donation system based on direct personal benefit is a viable strategy for meeting China's long-term blood unit needs [17], [18].",

Occasionally, higher government departments may provide funding for specific purposes, but neither these nor the local government subsidies should be counted on for routine revenue or to cover substantial expenditures. Donations from industry or individuals are negligible in China.

The survey collected data on operations and services in 2011 from 174 blood establishments across the country. According to this report, for many blood establishments, funding received for provision of services was significantly less than the cost of providing them. For example, a blood service facility bears a net loss of 52.33 RMB (US $8.18) when collecting and supplying a standard unit (200 mL) of whole blood, or the packed red cells and plasma separated from it (Table 1\n).",

Although the 200-mL collection volume is not favored by blood collection agencies, until the law is amended, the collection volume remains the decision of the donor. When a donation is made for a double unit (400 mL), the revenues to be collected will be doubled too. More double-unit donations will also save indirect expenses that cannot be attributed to a specific unit of blood, such as the expense of public education and donor recruitment, as well as fixed running costs such as human resource, electricity, water, and so on. Among the 174 institutions that participated in the survey, 38% of the blood collected was in double units. This may partially explain how a blood service could remain functional in spite of an unbalanced financial sheet. Another explanation was the significant indebtedness of these institutions. The survey indicated an average debt-to-fixed assets ratio of 21%, ranging from 0 to 180%, which was equivalent to an average debt of RMB 71400 (US $11156) per employee. It should be noted that debts are not allowed for government-sponsored establishments in China. These debts and increasing financial burden threaten the viability of organizations providing vital blood services. It could be a significant concern if these establishments are suddenly required to pay off these debts.",

Nevertheless, subsidies are not mandated, being left to local decisions and fiscal capacities. By law, blood service establishments are required to deposit all revenues to designated government-supervised accounts. As for the expenditures, they should have their budgets approved first by supervising agencies of the government. After budget approval, the actual expenses can be reimbursed from the deposited revenues. Governments may add subsidies if the amount of depositions cannot balance the approved expenses. The survey showed that two-thirds of the institutions that participated in the survey were permitted to use up all revenues they collected, and some were granted subsidies from local governments. However, for one-third of institutions, only 70% to 85% of revenues were returned to cover costs. The balance of funds was retained in the accounts under supervision. In these cases, no local subsidies will be given under normal conditions.",

The natural consequence is that the capacity to plan for quality and service improvement is very limited. The implementation of nuclear acid testing is a practical example of how new screening assays could be impaired if real costs cannot be properly assessed and covered. Although nuclear acid testing pilot studies were conducted in China as early as in 2002, it took 9 years before its adoption in some developed regions on the eastern coast in 2011 [22]. Nationwide adoption was achieved at the end of 2015, nearly 12 years behind the United States. In comparison, the HIV and HCV antibody tests were adopted in 1992 in eastern coast regions, only 7 and 2 years behind the very first assays adopted in the developed world. The entire country followed the leading institutions and made these 2 antibody tests routine in 1993. At that time, costs were being fully recovered based on local assessments.",

Challenges are likely to be encountered, particularly related to meeting ever-increasing clinical demands for blood products while maintaining the safety, integrity, and sustainability of the service. Most of these challenges are already being addressed, including but not limited to inappropriate blood utilization [29], the high prevalence of transfusion-transmitted infections [30], restrictions on eligible donation ages and intervals, regional differences in development, and isolated information management systems. There are other challenges, however, that are not linked directly to any specific issues, but that are of more strategic significance and have greater long-term implications.

First, the amount of blood donated annually has not kept pace with demand. Second, blood services are being impaired by cost-assessment standards that were inadequate from the very beginning. Third and finally, there is not enough performance measurement in the blood collection and processing system. A number of questions on these issues remain: shall the current mode of donation motivation remain driven by personal incentives, or would it be appropriate to embrace a major change and reaffirm the original principle of VNRBD? Shall blood establishments remain fiscally squeezed, or will cost recovery and government subsides be reassessed and revised regularly? Is it time to implement hemovigilance programs, and if so, shall they be made mandatory or voluntary? The authors believe that highlighting such matters is of primary importance for a sustainable blood program in China.",

Eventually, the rate of donations will reach or exceed demand and the growth rate will plateau. The dotted line represents donations based on an incentive system. Personal benefits or monetary incentives are strong and direct forces. There is a very fast initial growth phase.
