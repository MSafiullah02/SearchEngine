            "text": "Three thousand forty-nine tracheobronchial smears randomly collected on a daily basis between April 1, 1973 and March 31, 1975 were reviewed for the presence of cytoplasmic viral inclusion bodies (Fig 1\n). The smears were obtained from consenting patients undergoing general endotracheal anesthesia for elective surgery; 5 ml of physiologic saline solution was instilled down the tracheal tube immediately after intubation and was suctioned for return within 30 seconds with a transparent catheter. The catheter was cut where it was seen to contain mucus. Secretions were retrieved with an applicator stick, smeared on slides, spray-fixed at once, and stained (Papanicolaou and PAS methods). Information obtained from all patients during a preoperative visit included age, sex, and smoking habit. In addition, all medical records were screened both before and after surgery to ascertain (1) the reason for surgery, (2) any associated unrelated pathologic findings, (3) the histopathologic findings from surgical specimens, (4) the results of other diagnostic tests, and (5) the date of surgery. Smears from patients who had suffered from known viral infections within 15 days preceding surgery and from those with prediagnosed cardiac and infective pulmonary diseases were not included in the study. All patients were screened for the first seven postoperative days; and the development of temperature elevations above 38.4\u00b0C (101.1\u00b0F), positive physical signs in the chest, and roentgenologic changes were noted.6 The epidemiologic approach of Goldsmith and Berglund7 was used. Variables among patients were listed, including age, sex, smoking habit, preoperative respiratory status, preoperative and postoperative diagnoses, and other associated diseases contributing to the physical status of the patient. The contribution of each variable to the factor studied was assessed. Significance of statistical correlations was calculated by the chi-square method, using the Yates correction factor, at values of P < 0.05, because the series was small in comparison to the total group of patients screened.",

All were PAS-positive. Of these, 11 (31 percent) came from patients with extrathoracic malignant disease, one (3 percent) came from a subject with asymptomatic bronchogenic carcinoma diagnosed by routine roentgenographic study, eight (23 percent) came from subjects with benign tumors (uterus, breast, and prostate), and 15 (43 percent) came from patients suffering from a wide variety of conditions (inguinal hernia, retinal detachment, cholecystitis, fractures of the extremities, complications of pregnancy, tonsillitis, and peptic ulcer). No correlation could be found between the presence of inclusion bodies in smears and the age, sex, or smoking habit of patients. Although the incidences of malignant and benign tumors among patients with inclusion bodies appeared to be high (34 percent and 23 percent, respectively), they were not found to be significant when compared with the incidences of these tumors in the entire population screened (26 percent and 20.4 percent, respectively). No relationship was found between the presence of viral inclusion bodies and other abnormalities noted in smears; however, when the frequency of occurrence of inclusion bodies was assessed in relation to the season of the year, 60 percent (20) of all these smears (Fig 2\n) were found to have been collected during the months of January through March.",

Unlike other descriptions of patients with such inclusions, our subjects had no respiratory symptoms. Our findings are more in line with those of Str\u00f6m,4 who found viral shedding in the urinary tract of apparently healthy individuals. The Tecumseh and other studies of respiratory infections10, 11, 12 have demonstrated an increased incidence of infection with coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus during the winter months; and it is, therefore, probable that the majority of our patients had asymptomatic infections with these viruses.",
