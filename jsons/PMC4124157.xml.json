These examples are the most striking in an array of spectacular achievements of public health interventions coordinated by WHO for the last 60 years.

Pathogen richness is indeed generally higher in the tropics than in temperate areas [7] and in many cases, vector biodiversity further adds to the complexity of the transmission system [8]. Emblematic examples include malaria in Africa [9] where both the parasite and its mosquito vector species have now developed high levels of resistance to the most widely used drugs and insecticides, further jeopardizing control as well as elimination efforts [10, 11]. Yellow fever is another frustrating example where the pathogen remains endemic in many countries [12] despite the availability of an easily deliverable (lyophilized) and affordable vaccine [13] and because of uncontrolled sylvatic transmission cycles [14] allowing virus maintenance In turn, the current eradication campaign against poliomyelitis illustrates a tradeoff between limited available economic resources and their allocation to solve the myriad of problems that conflict or post-conflict countries have to confront without functioning governance and public administrations [15]. Moreover, in Pakistan and Afghanistan, although funding for polio eradication might not be an issue owing to substantial input from international and non governmental agencies, societal concerns about vaccination as well as the circulation of vaccine-derived polio viruses may represent the biggest roadblocks to successful eradication [16, 17]. Last but not least, the HIV pandemic, as well, still defies efficient control because 80% of the infected individuals live in countries where current antiretroviral therapies remain prohibitively expensive [18].",

During the last decades, the accumulation of ecological and evolutionary studies focusing on infectious diseases has shown that the niche of a pathogen holds more dimensions than just the host immune system targeted by vaccination. More specifically, the niche of a pathogen encompasses diverse intra- and inter-host levels (Figure 1). Consequently, its boundaries and evolution will depend upon a number of biotic and abiotic interactions that go far beyond competition for the resource in susceptible hosts, the presence of pathogens in the environment or the activation of the immune system machinery in the host and/or the vector.",

This competition can take several forms, through competition for resources such as red blood cells between different species of Plasmodium\n[38] or specialized cells within an organ like in the interaction between influenza viruses and pneumococcal bacteria in lungs [39]. Pathogens interactions are also mediated by the immune system, such as in the case of malaria and helminths [40] where each pathogen activates different and inter-dependent immune paths (Th1 and Th2). It is also the case for HIV that depresses the whole host immune system therefore fostering the development of opportunistic infections, especially to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) where individuals infected by HIV are 20 to 30 times more likely to develop an infection [41], a phenomenon enhanced by a higher fatality rate during treatment of co-infected patients. Finally, the within-host conditions also play an important role [42], through for instance malnutrition [43] or vaccine history that alters immune system efficiency [44].",

Indeed, with a given financial resource, it may be more efficient to dedicate a proportion of this money to one control measure, e.g., targeted vaccination, and the rest into another control measure, such as vector control, rather than 100% in either of the two. This clearly calls for theoretical studies that will inform on the expected outcomes of the different control methods, used alone and in combination, as well as foster the development of a modeling framework to identify the most suitable strategies admixtures that will allow optimal efficiency in terms of prevention and mitigation of infections. Such modeling framework could benefit from the last methodological developments in mathematical epidemiology [30] and optimization theory [53].",

Similarly, maternally inherited endosymbiotic bacterial Wolbachia infections were shown to directly reduce the susceptibility of insects to infection with a range of insect and human pathogens [55], above and beyond their impact on vector\u2019s life history traits relevant to vector capacity and transmission (e.g., blood feeding frequency, longevity, fecundity\u2026). Niche alteration can also result from a temporary mismatch between pathogens and hosts abundance. Many pathogens reproduce at a given period of time when resources are abundant and of good quality. It is known, for instance, that apparent competition can take place between two pathogens because one removes susceptible hosts to the other one, such as in the case of measles and whooping-cough [56].

This could be unrealistic is some settings (see above). In this context, the ecological theory suggests the importance of multiplying targets, rather than increasing selective pressure on a single mechanism, in order to circumvent the apparition of resistances. As an example, Dengue control mainly focuses on vector control while other strategies, such as the use of Wolbachia that constrain virus development in its mosquito vector or the currently-tested vaccine are emerging and should prompt a new approach to dengue control programs in a near future. For diseases where vaccine is the only control possibility, an immunization strategy finely-tuned to the pathogen spatio-temporal dynamics could still improve significantly its effectiveness. First attempts considering only temporal dimension have already shown the potential of such approach [61] and should be extended to the spatial dimension, by focusing on disease (or transmission) hotspots.",

Indeed, the necessity to include spatio-temporal dynamics of pathogens to understand local transmission, as well as efficiency of control programs, has been extensively demonstrated [62, 63]. As previously exposed, the pathogen niche moves in space and time. This implies that a period of time exists where control could be most efficient, which generally precedes the observation of optimal conditions for pathogen transmission. As an example, if vector abundance presents a seasonal pattern, it could be more efficient to enforce vector control strategies when abundance is low as vector populations might then be more amenable to control in otherwise adverse environmental conditions.",

First, it relies on the availability of several control tools with different targets that can be implemented together at the same time in the same place, or sequentially in time and space. Pathogens and vectors are known to be extremely plastic in their behavior with a high adaptive potential. Failures in implementation or incorrect planning might result in pathogen escape and niche shift with unforeseen consequences for human health and the environment. The second challenge therefore resides in the ability of public health managers to act fast and implement several control strategies together locally, within a short time-frame, but also to repeat such actions during several years in order to ensure an efficient pathogen control over the long-term. From the point of view of economic resources, the costs can be decreased quite significantly (lower level of drug use, less storage, shortening the necessity of cold chain,\u2026), but the logistics and organization could be more complex to sort out.",
