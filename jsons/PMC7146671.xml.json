Group activities in nursing homes were also prohibited. As a consequence, the residents of nursing homes became more socially isolated. We have observed that under the dual stress of fear of infection and worries about the residents' condition, the level of anxiety among staff in nursing homes increased and they developed signs of exhaustion and burnout after a month-long full lockdown of the facilities.",

For example, mental health professionals, social workers, nursing home administrators, and volunteers should deliver mental health care for people living with dementia collaboratively. Within such a team, dementia experts could take the lead and support team members from other disciplines. Self-help guidance for reducing stress, such as relaxation or meditation exercise, could be delivered through electronic media. Service teams could support behavioural management through telephone hotlines. Psychological counsellors could provide online consultation for carers at home and in nursing homes.11 In addition, we encourage people who have a parent with dementia to have more frequent contact or spend more time with their parent, or to take on some of the caregiving duties so as to give the carer some respite time.",
