Hand washing, for example, will only interrupt transmission mediated by hand contact and only be an effective intervention if hand contact poses a high infection risk, relative to the other routes.",

The contact route involves the deposition of virus on the eyes, nostrils, and/or lips by touching virus\u2010contaminated objects, that is, the fingertip, to those tissues, followed by transport of virus to the appropriate receptors.(\n\n11\n, \n12\n\n) The inhalation route involves the inhalation of virus\u2010containing respirable particles (aerodynamic diameters, da \u2264 10 \n\u03bcm), which deposit throughout the respiratory tract, including the lung. The inspiration route involves the inhalation of inspirable particles (10 < da \u2264 100 \n\u03bcm), which deposit in the mouth and naso\u2010pharynx region. The inhalation and inspiration routes are distinguished because respirable and inspirable particles deposit in different regions of the respiratory tract;(\n\n13\n\n) and influenza receptor localization and temperature gradients in respiratory tract differentially influence the likelihood of infection in each region.(\n\n14\n, \n15\n, \n16\n, \n17\n\n) \nIn vivo studies demonstrate that the location of virus deposition differentially impacts infection risk.(\n\n18\n, \n19\n, \n20\n, \n21\n\n) The direct spray route involves the direct projection of virus carried in cough and sneeze particles (generally da > 100 \n\u03bcm) onto the eyes, nostrils, and lips.",

While Nicas and Jones,(\n\n20\n\n) using point estimates for all model parameters, found that all four routes may contribute significantly to influenza infection risk, Atkinson and Wein(\n\n22\n\n) concluded that inhalation was the predominate route of transmission. One reason for the different results is the parameterization of the contact route. Atkinson and Wein(\n\n22\n\n) used a composite parameter to represent the transfer of virus from the surface to the facial membranes via hand contact (5 \u00d7 10\u22126 m2/h in the infectors bedroom), that is, two orders of magnitude lower than the equivalent rate estimated by Nicas and Jones(\n\n20\n\n) (8.8 \u00d7 10\u22124 m2/h).

Variation in experimental designs has led to inactivation rates that vary by an order of magnitude, such as influenza A PR8 inactivation in air as studied by Hemmes et al.\n(\n\n62\n\n) and Harper(\n\n61\n\n) ( per hour vs.  per hour at 15\u201340% RH and room temperature) and influenza A on glass versus steel and formica as studied by Buckland and Tyrell(\n\n68\n\n) and Bean et al.\n(\n\n63\n\n) ( per hour vs.  per hour at room temperature). Even for less striking differences, absent variability data, it is difficult to assess if inactivation rates truly vary by virus type (A or B) or substrate. In uncertainty analyses presented here, variability in influenza virus inactivation on substrates has been based on the CV observed for related viruses. Due to uncertainty in variability, the viruses have been grouped for analysis: in air at room temperature, on porous substrates, on steel and formica, and on glass.",

Understanding of influenza inactivation and transfer has been limited by a lack of realism and documentation of variability: increasing the realism in contact scenarios and virus matrix, and documenting study replicate results would contribute significantly to the knowledge about how the environment, virus strain, and human activity affects the transport of virus through the environment. Factors that have been rarely or never studied include: the transfer of influenza A between skin, including during self\u2010contact, environmental contact rates, and frequency of direct spray events. All of these factors directly affect the likelihood of exposure through contact, inspiration, and direct spray. None of the limitations are insurmountable.",
