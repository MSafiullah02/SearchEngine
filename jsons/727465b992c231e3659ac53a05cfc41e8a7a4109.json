Diagnosis was confirmed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasal exudate or sputum samples. Clinical, analytical, and radiographic findings were registered. Results RT-PCR detected COVID-19 infection in all patients, affecting males and people with a cervical level of injury more often (five out of seven). The average delay for diagnostic confirmation was 4 days (interquartile range, 1-10). Fever was the most frequent symptom (six out of seven). The second most common symptom was asthenia (four out of seven), followed by dyspnea, cough, and expectoration (three out of seven for each symptom). The Modified Early Warning System score for Covid-19 severity rating was classified as severe in five out of seven cases. All but one patient showed radiological alterations evident in chest X-rays at the time of diagnosis. All patients recovered gradually. Conclusion Our patients with SCI and Covid-19 infection exhibited fewer symptoms than the general population. Furthermore, they presented similar or greater clinical severity. The clinical evolution was not as pronounced as had been expected. This study recommends close supervision of the SCI population to detect early compatible signs and symptoms of Covid-19 infection.",

            "text": "In late December 2019, an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began in Wuhan and spread rapidly throughout the world [1] . The World Health Organization declared the 2019 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic on March 11, 2020 and as of April 2, 2020, a total of 1,002,159 cases were confirmed worldwide with 51,485 deaths [2] . The first confirmed imported case of Covid-19 was detected in Spain in La Gomera (Canary Islands) on January 31, 2020 [2] . Since then and up to April 2, 2020, a total of 110,286 cases have been confirmed in Spain, including 10,096 deaths [2] . On March 17, 2020, the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed at the Hospital Nacional de Parapl\u00e9jicos (HNP) in Toledo Spain, a 212-bed national spinal cord injury (SCI) monographic hospital classified as a long-term healthcare facility dedicated to the comprehensive rehabilitation of people with acute SCI as well as people with chronic SCI with multiple comorbidities. The source of the first patient\u00b4s infection was close contact with their relative, who was also later diagnosed with Covid-19. Since then, despite having isolated the infected patient in the hospital and the use of personal protective equipment against infection by both the healthcare workers and the noninfected patients in quarantine, it was inevitable that new cases of infection were also detected among patients with up to a total of seven currently confirmed as of April 7, 2020. SCI involves multiple neurological and systemic complications, which drastically interfere with the quality of life and life expectancy [3] . Several demographic and clinical factors associated with the more aggressive Covid-19 phenotype have been identified: male gender, age over 60 years, and the presence of previous comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, cardiac ischemic disease, lung disease, and immunosuppression [4] . It is reasonable to assume SCI as a high-risk comorbidity, mostly due to the presence of respiratory failure as a result of thoracoabdominal muscle weakness [5] and also because of systemic immunosuppression due to injury [6, 7] . Suppression of the immune system after SCI is due to noradrenergic overactivation and excess glucocorticoid release via hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis stimulation [8] and also to autoimmunity [9] . Both phenomena, respiratory failure and injury-induced immunosuppression, are more pronounced after cervical or high-thoracic compared with low-thoracic SCI level, which explains why pneumonia is the leading cause of mortality in SCI patients [10] . As Covid-19 is a novel viral respiratory infection, its epidemiology and clinical course among people with SCI are yet unknown. However, recently the first survey has been published which addresses COVID-19-related practices and adaptations among health care professionals working with individuals with SCI [11] . So far, only one case of Covid-19 infection with SCI has been reported [12] . Considering all the secondary complications associated with SCI, it is reasonable to expect a harsh prognosis with Covid-19 infection.",

The vulnerability of people with SCI is well known [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . We have found that more than half of our patients showed one or two symptoms at the moment of Covid-19 confirmation, which is lower than the symptomatic expression in other published case series [18] . We hypothesized that the Covid-19 symptoms overlapped with some of the signs of respiratory failure due to SCI, which would have complicated the accurate clinical diagnosis. The average time delay between diagnosis in our case series was shorter than that found in other series, which may reflect rapid early identification of the initial Covid-19 symptoms in a cohort of hospitalized patients who were already receiving close attention for their SCI. At the onset of Covid-19 infection, fever and asthenia were the most frequently observed symptoms, which slightly differed from other published series that identified cough and fever as initial symptoms in the general population [18] [19] [20] . We agree with the previous case of Covid-19 SCI in a patient with SCI which reported that cough was not the prevalent symptom [12] . However, despite the less evident symptomatology in our cohort, the MEWS score confirmed that they presented a higher risk of clinical worsening compared with the general population [18] . Before the clinical onset of Covid-19 infection, only half of the patients had a tracheostomy, which required bronchial aspiration and hyperinflation techniques to remove respiratory secretions.",
