CoVs are classified into three different genetic and antigenic genera, each of which is divided into several subgenera. Bovine-like CoVs and bovine CoVs (BCoVs), which belong to Betacoronavirus 1, contain five major structural proteins: nucleocapsid (N), transmembrane (M), spike (S), small membrane (E), and hemagglutinin/esterase (HE) (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997). Betacoronavirus 1 also include the human CoVs-OC43 (HCoV-OC43), porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), equine coronavirus (ECoV), canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) and bubaline coronavirus (BuCoV) (Decaro et al., 2008, Erles et al., 2007, Guy et al., 2000, Haring and Perlman, 2001, Vijgen et al., 2006).",

BcoV uses N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid) as a receptor to initiate infection (Schultze and Herrler, 1992). Although S protein has an affinity for 9-O-acetylated sialic acid, HE protein has been identified as the principal BcoV sialic acid-binding protein (Schultze et al., 1991a, Schultze et al., 1991b). Therefore, HE may be involved in virus entry and/or virus release from infected cells (Schultze et al., 1991a). The S protein, which is composed of two subunits, S1 and S2, has several important functions during the virus\u2013host interaction. The S1 subunit is associated with binding to host cell receptors, whereas the S2 subunit is the viral M protein that mediates the fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Thus, S protein is critical for virus entry and pathogenesis (Schultze et al., 1991b). The variation in host range and tissue tropism among CoV is largely attributable to variations in the S protein (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001).",

Korean BcoVs strains collected before 2004 were divided into several clusters. A BcoV-white-tailed deer strain isolated in 1994 (Tsumemitsu et al., 1995) formed a cluster together with Korean BcoV-KWD1\u201310 isolates, with the exception of KWD 7.",

However, no relationship between Korean bovine-like CoVs and those from wild ruminants at other locations was detected. Sequence analysis of the S and HE genes, however, indicated that the strains show a high similarity to BcoV. This was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis, thus supporting data obtained previously (Alekseev et al., 2008). The CoV strain isolated in this study appears to derive from the same ancestor as the BcoV 05/01 and BcoV 05/02 strains isolated from cattle in Korea. Also, the sequences of the S and HE genes of Korean CoV strains represented on the tree grouped according to year of isolation. These data support the hypothesis that genetic difference may be related more to the time of the appearance of an outbreak than to its geographic location (Alekseev et al., 2008, Jeong et al., 2005b).",
