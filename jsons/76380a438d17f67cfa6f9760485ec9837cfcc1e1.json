            "text": "Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the chest computed tomography (CT) findings in patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 and to evaluate its relationship with clinical features. Materials and Methods: Study sample consisted of 80 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 from January to February 2020. The chest CT images and clinical data were reviewed, and the relationship between them was analyzed. Results: Totally, 80 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included. With regards to the clinical manifestations, 58 (73%) of the 80 patients had cough, and 61 (76%) of the 80 patients had high temperature levels. The most frequent CT abnormalities observed were ground glass opacity (73/80 cases, 91%), consolidation (50/80 cases, 63%), and interlobular septal thickening (47/80, 59%). Most of the lesions were multiple, with an average of 12 \u00b1 6 lung segments involved. The most common involved lung segments were the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe (69/80, 86%), the posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe (68/80, 85%), the lateral basal segment of the right lower lobe (64/80, 80%), the dorsal segment of the left lower lobe (61/80, 76%), and the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe (65/80, 81%). The average pulmonary inflammation index value was (34% \u00b1 20%) for all the patients. Correlation analysis showed that the pulmonary inflammation index value was significantly correlated with the values of lymphocyte count, monocyte count, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, days from illness onset, and body temperature (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The common chest CT findings of COVID-19 are multiple ground glass opacity, consolidation, and interlobular septal thickening in both lungs, which are mostly distributed under the pleura. There are significant correlations between the degree of pulmonary inflammation and the main clinical symptoms and laboratory results. Computed tomography plays an important role in the diagnosis and evaluation of this emerging global health emergency.",

Soon afterwards, an increasing number of patients without being exposed to the animal market started to grow exponetially, indicating a fact of human-tohuman transmission. At present, this kind of pneumonia has been confirmed as a new type of acute respiratory infectious disease caused by coronavirus infection. 2, 3 However, it is not clear how expeditiously and sustainably the virus spreads from person to person. On February 12, 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses announced that the official classification of the new coronavirus was severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The same day, the World Health Organization announced that the official name of the disease caused by the virus was coronavirus disease 2019 . The coronavirus has been spreading rapidly around the world, infecting no fewer than 70,000 people and leading to a certain degree of public panic. [4] [5] [6] On January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a \"public health emergency of international concernexternal icon.\" The epidemic caused by the new coronavirus has become a public health emergency of international concern.",

Common clinical symptoms of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 include fever fatigue and dry cough. Besides, a small number of patients could have nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, or diarrhea. Furthermore, in some aggravated cases, infection has led to severe acute respiratory syndrome, renal failure, and even death. In severe cases, patients present with dyspnea and/or hypoxemia 1 week after the onset of the disease, and develop rapidly into acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulation dysfunction, which are hard to correct.

All the patients were scanned in a supine position during breath-holding at full inspiration. All CT images were evaluated using a lung window, with a window level of \u2212500 HU and window width of 1500 HU. Two certificated chest radiologists with 10 and 8 years' experience independently reviewed the CT images while they were blinded to the names and clinical data of the patients. The CT imaging features were fully assessed, and the following findings were highlighted: ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, interlobular septal thickening, bronchial wall thickening, subpleural line, lymph node enlargement, pleural effusion, and pericardial effusion in accordance with the standard morphologic descriptors based on the Fleischner Society Nomenclature Committee recommendations and similar studies. 7,8 As a rule, a consensus had to be reached between the 2 radiologists about the abnormalities, and discrepancies were reconciled and tackled via discussion. Specifically, the evaluation of the size and extent of lung involvement was based on the segments of the lung anatomy: 10 segments in the right lung and 10 segments in the left lung (2 segments were considered in the apicoposterior segment of the left upper lobe and 2 segments were considered in the inferior front segment of the left lower lobe). According to the evaluation criterion established by Chongqing Radiologist Association of China, the pulmonary inflammation index (PII) was obtained from each patient. PII = (distribution score + size score)/40 \u00c2 100% (Fig. 1 ). Distribution score: scored according to the lesion distribution, one score for each lung segment, and 20 scores for left and right lung. Lesion size was scored according to whether the lesion occupied more than 50% of the lung segment volume, one score for \u226550%, and zero score for <50%. Spearman correlations were performed to evaluate the relationships between the PII value and the clinical symptom and laboratory results of the patients. All statistical analyses were conducted using Statistical Package for Social Sciences software version 23.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).

Early identification and early intervention are vital to reduce the incidence and mortality of severe cases. In this study, most patients were adults, and there was no significant difference between the numbers of either male or female. Cough and fever were the most common clinical symptoms. The incidence of expectoration, chest pain, muscle ache, abdominal pain or diarrhea, pharyngeal discomfort, headache or dizziness, and dyspnea were less common. This is similar to other types of coronavirus infections such as the SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). [11] [12] [13] This implies that they can presumably be classified as the same kind of infection and the target cells of SARS-CoV-2 may also be located in the lower respiratory tract.",

            "text": "For chest CT, 76 cases (95%) had abnormalities indicating the pneumonia. On the whole, in comparison with other types of pneumonia, COVID-19 seemed to cause milder symptoms and severer pulmonary changes on CT. Most of the patients had mild symptoms and mild temperature rise, but their lung manifestations were serious. Multiple lesions were found in multiple segments and lobes of both lungs, which was different from the bacterial pneumonia. In other words, multiple and large lesions of 2 lungs involved simultaneously is not generally spotted in the typical bacterial pneumonia. 14, 15 The most common involved lung segments were the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe, the posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe, the lateral basal segment of the right lower lobe, the dorsal segment of the left lower lobe, and the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe. There were significant correlations among the degree of pulmonary inflammation and the main clinical symptoms and laboratory results. Our results suggested that chest CT could be used to evaluate the severity of the disease and played an important role in clinical practice. For CT features, GGO was the most common of all the abnormalities, followed by consolidation and interlobular septal thickening. This is consistent with the results of the recently published studies. [16] [17] [18] Occasionally, the subpleural line and bronchial wall thickening could be seen, whereas pleura effusion, pericardial effusion, or lymph node enlargement were rare to identify. Some of the GGO was characterized by the reticular interlobular septa thickening, which was called \"crazy paving pattern.\" It resulted from the alveolar edema and interstitial inflammatory of acute lung injury, which had been reported in SARS. 9, 10 In another situation, some of the GGO showed a triangular or angular shape under the pleura with the internal interlobular septa thickened like a net. The adjacent pleura were pulled and formed a spider web-like shape in the corner. Thus, we named it \"spider web sign.\" However, the pathological basis needs further pathological confirmation. It is a specific sign for COVID-19, which has not been reported in other diseases in the literature. At present, it is not clear whether it has clinical value in evaluating the prognosis of patients. Recently, Pan et al have analyzed the time course of lung changes in 21 mild patients with confirmed COVID-19. They found that the initial lung manifestation was subpleural GGO, which turned to consolidation 2 weeks after the onset of the disease, and then the lesions were gradually absorbed, leaving a wide range of GGO and subpleural parenchymal bands. 17 In another article, the authors found that after 7 days of treatment for the mild patients, there was a significant reduction in GGO on chest CT. On the 13th day after admission, most of the ground glass disappeared. Our patients constituted FIGURE 3 . A-C, Chest CT of a 44-year-old man. The clinical manifestations were fever (38.5\u00b0C), cough, dizziness, and headache. C-reactive protein level was increased. \"Spider web signs\" (white thin arrow) were seen. a complete group with mild, severe, and critical types. 19 All patients completed CT examination within 2 days after admission, which was 7 \u00b1 4 days from the onset of the disease.",

Computed tomography played an important role in the diagnosis and evaluation of this emerging global health emergency. Nevertheless, this study has 3 limitations. First of all, this was a retrospective study involving a small number of patients with proven SARS-CoV-2 infection. Second, none of the patients had a lung biopsy or autopsy to reflect the histopathological changes. Third, this study was a cross-sectional study, and we could not analyze the dynamic CT changes in different stages. In the future work, we will investigate the chest CT features of differential stages of COVID-19 by using larger, more diverse samples.",
