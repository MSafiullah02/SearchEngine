Thus, those persons wearing standard surgical facemasks are still atrisk for droplet exposure via the lateral, unsealed portions of the face mask.4\u20136 On the contrary, standard respirators approved by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), namely N95 masks, are fit and seal tested to ensure filtration of atleast 95% of airborne droplets. Few studies characterizing efficacy of cloth masks exist. To a lesser extent, viral transmission occurs by spread of microdroplets from contaminated surfaces onto the face, nasopharyngeal, and oropharyngeal mucosa. Therefore, most mask options are intended for single use only, and must be carefully doffed and disposed. In the setting of a pandemic, the reuse of respirators is also being entertained and warrants careful consideration.",

Interestingly, the benefit of either mask was significantly dependent on adherence of facemask use. Moreover, Aiello et al13 observed that therisk reduction of viral contraction with surgical facemask use was significant with concomitant hand washing practices. Such findings collectively suggest that theadherent use of even suboptimal facemasks, along with recommended hand washing practices, may provide meaningful decrement in the risk of contracting respiratory viral illnesses.",
