Methods A retrospective case-control study of patients with severe infection who were treated with tigecycline was conducted. Patients were assigned to the hypofibrinogenaemia group (< 2.0 g/L) and normal fibrinogen (normal) group (\u2265 2.0 g/L) to assess the clinical features of patients with tigecycline-associated hypofibrinogenaemia. The traits of patients treated with cefoperazone/ sulbactam in the hypofibrinogenaemia group were also analyzed. Results In total, 127 patients were enrolled in the study, including 71 patients with hypofibrinogenaemia and 56 patients with normal fibrinogen levels. Hypofibrinogenaemia developed at a median of 6 (4-8) days after tigecycline treatment, and the fibrinogen level returned to normal at a median of 3 (3-5) days after tigecycline discontinuation. In the multivariate analysis, intra-abdominal infection (p = 0.005), fibrinogen level at tigecycline initiation (p < 0.001), maintenance dose (p = 0.039), and treatment duration (p = 0.002) were found to be related to hypofibrinogenaemia. Treatment with cefoperazone/sulbactam was not associated with hypofibrinogenaemia (p = 0.681), but patients treated with cefoperazone/sulbactam had a higher incidence of coagulopathy (p = 0.009) and needed more blood products (p = 0.003) than those treated without cefoperazone/sulbactam. Conclusion Tigecycline-associated hypofibrinogenaemia often developed on the 6th (4th-8th) day of tigecycline use and was associated with intra-abdominal infection, fibrinogen level at tigecycline initiation, maintenance dose, and treatment duration of tigecycline but not cefoperazone/sulbactam.",

Tigecycline, the first glycylcycline discovered, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in June 2005 and entered the Chinese market in November 2011. It has been widely used since 2015 [1] and requires intravenous administration with a loading dose of 100 mg followed by 50 mg twice daily. Tigecycline has broad-spectrum activity; it inhibits protein synthesis by acting on the 30S ribosomal subunit, blocking entry of aminoacyl-transfer ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules into the ribosome site [2] . Tigecycline is active against resistant pathogens such as methicillinresistant staphylococci, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci [3] . The main indications for tigecycline are complicated intraabdominal infection, complicated skin and skin-and-softtissue infection, and community-acquired pneumonia caused by bacteria sensitive to tigecycline.",

Dong et al. [16] reported that combinations of rifampin/tigecycline and sulbactam/tigecycline show good in vitro activity against extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strains. Another in vitro study revealed that combination therapies (tigecycline/colistin and tigecycline/sulbactam) could achieve lower mutant prevention concentrations (MPCs) of tigecycline than tigecycline use alone [17] . A review showed that tigecycline plus sulbactam, carbapenem, or rifampicin showed synergistic effects against different bacteria [18] . Cefoperazone/sulbactam, the combination of a thirdgeneration cephalosporin and a \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor, is mostly used in China to treat severe bacterial infections and as a combination therapy with tigecycline to treat drug-resistant pathogens. It has low renal toxicity and high safety levels [19] , but long-term high-dose use may lead to vitamin Kdependent coagulation dysfunction. Hu [20] reported a fatal vitamin K-dependent coagulopathy associated with cefoperazone/sulbactam in a 79-year-old man with normal coagulation function and no history of blood or liver disease. However, whether cefoperazone/sulbactam combined with tigecycline aggravates coagulopathy or hypofibrinogenaemia is unclear.",

Extensively drug-resistant bacteria (XDR) are defined as being non-susceptible to at least one agent in all but two or fewer antimicrobial categories (i.e., bacterial isolates remain susceptible to only one or two categories) [24] .",

The normal range of the fibrinogen level in the bloodstream is 2 to 4 g/L. Hypofibrinogenaemia can occur in pa ; patients with acquired hepatic dysfunction, such as cirrhosis, hepatitis, and metastatic hepatoma [26] ; and patients with severe malnutrition. Acute hypofibrinogenaemia is associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), severe sepsis, malignancy, and drug administration (valproic acid, synthetic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), prednisolone, L-asparaginase, allopurinol, and tigecycline) [4] . In this study, there was no difference in medical history, age, sex, or infection indices or liver function at the time of tigecycline initiation between the two groups. Indeed, the fibrinogen levels of 42 out of 51 patients recovered after the discontinuation of tigecycline. Therefore, all of the cases of hypofibrinogenaemia were most likely caused by tigecycline. In the hypofibrinogenaemia group, 71 patients (56%) developed hypofibrinogenaemia at a median (25-75th percentile) of 6 (4-8) days. This is in agreement with prior reports: Sabanis et al. [4] showed that coagulation parameters worsened markedly on day 7 after the start of tigecycline, and Rossitto et al. [7] and Duran et al. [11] demonstrated that hypofibrinogenaemia developed on days 5 and 10, respectively. Routsi et al. [7] , in a study of 45 ICU patients on tigecycline, reported that a progressive increase in the plasma fibrinogen concentration occurred from day 0 to 7 and in two case reports on days 2 and 19 [4, 10] . In this study, the fibrinogen level of 82% of the patients (42/52) returned to within the normal range in a median of 3 (3) (4) (5) days. This is also in accord with previous cases [4, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Hypofibrinogenaemia induced by tigecycline has not been analyzed in large clinical trials, and the risk factors for tigecycline-associated hypofibrinogenaemia are unclear. Only two clinical studies [5, 12] have reported a significantly decreased fibrinogen level in patients treated with a high dose, and Wu et al. [10] showed that female sex, renal insufficiency, and a high dose may be risk factors for adverse reactions in patients with tigecyclineassociated coagulation disorder. Univariate analyses in our study also showed that the maintenance dose (p = 0.027) was a risk factor for hypofibrinogenaemia, and a loading dose of 50 mg (p = 0.045) and maintenance dose of 50 mg Q12H (p = 0.016) may protect against hypofibrinogenaemia.",

Cunha and colleagues first reported that HD tigecycline is effective and it became the preferred dosing regimen for treating serious systemic infections due to susceptible and MDR pathogens [27] ; thereafter, some studies confirmed HD tigecycline is associated with improved outcomes (including clinical outcome, microbiological eradication rate, increased survival time, and decreased mortality) compared with LD tigecycline [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . However, a retrospective study including 134 patients who were diagnosed with ventilatorassociated pneumonia (VAP) showed no significant difference in the incidence of 28-day mortality among different dose groups (LD, HD, and non-standard HD groups) [33] . In addition, a meta-analysis including 17 studies (11 studies from China, 3 published in English, and 8 in Chinese) showed that all-cause mortality for patients treated with HD tigecycline was significantly lower than that for patients treated with LD tigecycline; however, subgroup analyses by country showed no significant difference in the non-Chinese studies. The microbiological eradication rate of the HD regimen was also significantly higher than that of the LD regimen, whereas a non-Chinese study presented a negative result in the subgroup analyses [34] . Hence, both efficacy and safety should be taken into account when a physician chooses tigecycline as an antibacterial agent.",

This may be linked to the mechanism by which tigecycline induces hypofibrinogenaemia. Antibiotics in general are associated with coagulation disorders, as they reduce the microflora of the colon and the distal ileum, which synthesize vitamin K 2 (menaquinone) [35] . The underlying mechanism for this effect is unclear. Moreover, intra-abdominal infection can further reduce the intestinal microflora. Compared with the mortality due to sepsis in patients in a prior study [36] , patients in our study had an increased 28-day ICU mortality rate (52.1% vs. 58.9%). Increased SOFA scores (9.54 \u00b1 6.20 vs. 10.95 \u00b1 7.23) and multiple or extensively drug-resistant bacteria (40.9% and 48.8% Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively) may be an explanation; moreover, 41 patients suffering from bloodstream infection may be another reason.",

Longterm high-dose use of cefoperazone/sulbactam can cause vitamin K deficiency, leading to reduced levels of vitamin Kdependent coagulation factors and resulting in coagulation disorder. Although alteration of the microflora of the colon and the distal ileum, which synthesize vitamin K 2 , is a commonly cited mechanism of antibiotic-associated coagulopathy, the mechanism of hypofibrinogenaemia is unclear. It has been suggested that the tigecycline-mediated inhibition of cytokines interferes with fibrinogen production [9] . Sabanis et al. [4] showed that coagulopathy induced by the inhibition of MK-producing bacteria or by a direct effect on hepatic vitamin K activation and impaired liver function is implicated in the fibrinogen-level reduction. Furthermore, they recommended that the mechanisms be investigated, focusing on the role of genetic factors [4] . Therefore, further studies of the mechanisms underlying tigecycline-associated hypofibrinogenaemia are warranted.",
