During SARS epidemic period, it showed that the decoctions of traditional Chinese herbs could significantly alleviate SARS symptoms in clinic [3,4,[6], [7], [8]]. Thus, we have been studying the phytochemicals and pharmacological activities of Nervilia fordii since 2009 [[9], [10], [11], [12], [13]]. Modern pharmacological studies demonstrated that Nervilia fordii has antitumor, antiviral, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory activities [[14], [15], [16], [17]]. In our previous work, we found that the flavonoids and polysaccharides are two main constituents in Nervilia fordii which display compelling anti- inflammatory activities [10,11,13].",

Thereafter, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and the radical NO releasing from LPS-activated RAW264.7 macrophages which have been treated with NFP-1 of different concentrations were significantly decreased as compared to those of LPS-vehicle group (Fig. 8A, B, C, E). It was worthy to be noted that IL-10 releasing from LPS-activated RAW264.7 macrophages which have been treated with NFP-1 of different concentrations were assuredly promoted as compared to that of LPS-vehicle group (Fig. 8D). It is well known that IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine which can predominantly inhibit LPS mediated induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 [45,46]. This assay further confirmed that NFP-1 has immunomodulatory potential, particularly on inflammation.",

Botanical polysaccharides could induce a variety of immune responses in macrophages, such as promoting the proliferation, inducing the production of NO, promoting the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Activated macrophages play an important role in the occurrence and development of inflammation disease. However, the pro-inflammatory mediators cascade would break out when macrophages were excessively activated by the severe infection, such as bacteria and viruses [49]. In vitro studies have demonstrated that NFP-1 could modulate the immune responses in macrophages with or without LPS. Therefore, it was considered that NFP-1 possessed dual function in immunomodulatory.",
