The models attempt to minimize outbreak morbidity and mortality through various vaccination policies and procedures. Smallpox vaccination complication rates with the currently available live vaccinia virus are of significant concern to individuals and public health response planners. More recent information on vaccination complication rates, especially for healthcare workers (HCWs), is now available from the experience of vaccinia virus vaccination in the USA over the last five years. Combining the more recent knowledge on vaccination complications and potential immunologic mechanisms with the mathematical models will allow public health leaders and HCWs opportunities for the most informed decisions. No model can be truly predictive, no one control measure identified as best, but evidence exists for the prevaccination of HCWs prior to the first recognized case.",

In their computer simulation, the hospital had 686 workers (a relatively small facility compared to many tertiary care institutions) and 133 of these made close contact with smallpox cases prior to the initiation of isolation measures. Of 828 cases, 50% originated in the hospital and 13% of the contacts were untraceable. Preemptive smallpox (vaccinia virus) vaccination of 10% of the hospital workers, in addition to surveillance and containment, had a small effect on the average number of cases; however, preemptive vaccination of 50% of the hospital workers had a relatively large effect on case reduction. The larger number of preemptive vaccinations required less contact tracing and \u2018ring\u2019 containment vaccinations.

As of April 28, 2006, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) has administered over 1 004 000 Dryvax\u2122 (Wyeth; New York City Board of Health strain vaccinia) live virus vaccinations to military operational forces and HCWs. Most adverse events were at rates below historical values, and the death rate directly attributed to vaccination was one per million in this select population of male and female military members.8 Other vaccinia strains, such as the Lister strain utilized in some European countries, may have higher estimated complication rates (8.4 deaths per million vaccinations).9 Of the initial screened military population, ninety thousand members were medically exempt, a majority for a history of atopic dermatitis/eczema or family member with the condition. The one unfortunate attributable death was a 22-year-old female United States Army Reservist undergoing mobilization. A lupus-like syndrome developed a month after receiving five vaccinations including smallpox and anthrax. The evidence favored a causal relationship to the vaccinia vaccination. Pathology showed a lymphocytic pericarditis with eosinophils and diffuse alveolar damage.10 As of October 2004, 24 DoD vaccinees were hospitalized with myocardial ischemia 2\u201324 days post vaccination. Myocardial infarction occurred in 13 military members, with one fatality. Many individuals presenting with cardiac ischemia had significant preexisting cardiovascular disease.11 The coronary events were judged unrelated to smallpox vaccination. An expert panel also concluded that the ischemic events did not exceed the expected level of 40 cardiac admissions in unvaccinated DoD personnel. The authors of the myocardial ischemia review, which included the senior leadership of the DoD smallpox vaccination effort, concluded that the available data \u201cdo not support a causal relation between ischemic cardiac events and receipt of the smallpox vaccine; however this possibility cannot be excluded.\u201d",

The serious events included 21 cases of myopericarditis and 10 cardiac ischemic events. The 10 ischemic events included four cases of increased angina and six myocardial infarctions with two fatalities among women, ages 55 and 57 years old, one and four days after vaccination, respectively. The interval between vaccination and cardiac symptoms was seven to 14 days with a median of eight days in the majority of cases. Two cases of insidious onset dilated cardiomyopathy occurred two to three months after vaccination. Statistically speaking, the rate of ischemic cardiac events in civilian vaccinees did not appear to exceed the rate in a comparable unvaccinated population. The older revaccinees had a higher risk of adverse events due to age-related underlying chronic disease, especially coronary artery disease. Among the nearly 38 000 live virus vaccine recipients, there was no transmission of vaccinia to others; specifically, no nosocomial transmissions occurred.",

Langerhans cells, at the base of the epidermis, are implicated as antigen processing sites, and replication of the vaccinia virus in the lower epidermis is important to developing effective immunity. The skin of atopic individuals involves multiple abnormal immunologic responses including increased expression of Th2 cytokines such as IL-4.24 Atopic individuals also have keratinocytes producing abnormal chemokines favoring Th2 lymphocyte production of IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13.
