You probably don't eat bushmeat, but Western consumerism adds to the deforestation and habitat destruction that increasingly brings humans into contact with animal viruses. The world is in turmoil due to a virus unleashed in part by greed, and how do we respond? By going shopping.",

Not exactly a feast to write home about, but, supplemented by the dwindling contents of my cupboards, they became an excellent curry. It felt like a triumph of thrift and ingenuity.
