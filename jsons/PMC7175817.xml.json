Italian epidemiologic data updated to March 24th, show a very critical situation with a total of 69,176 confirmed infected people, of which 8326 have recovered and 6820 are deceased [3]. Therefore, at this time this is written, Italy is the nation with the most deaths due to COVID-19 worldwide; the reason of this may be related to different factors such as timing and modalities of confinement, older median age, rate of smoking and pollution. Moreover, reported deaths in our system include all cases deceased with coronavirus rather than for coronavirus; clinical chart review is ongoing to detect causality. The lack of the precise number of asymptomatic subjects also prevents the possibility to calculate the true infection fatality rate, that strictly depends on the extent of the swab test to the whole general population. While asymptomatic infections have in fact been described, their exact prevalence is still unknown [4]. In order to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic subjects all 3711 people on board of the Diamond Princess cruise ship were tested, and the percentage of asymptomatic subjects was 17.9% (95% CI 15.5\u201320.2%) [5].",

Sars-CoV-2 gains entrance in lung cells thanks to the interaction between the S protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [6, 7]. Following replication and sub-genomic RNA synthesis, the viral structural proteins, S, E, and M are inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where viral genomes forms mature virions, that are transported to the cell surface in vesicles and released by exocytosis [8].",

Full-genome sequencing revealed that Sars-CoV-2 belongs to betacoronavirus but diverges from MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV [6, 9]. Considering SARS-Cov-2 genetic similarity to RaTG13 bat coronavirus, with whom it shares 96% of the genome, the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is likely [10]. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats and were transmitted to human by an intermediate host [11]; in analogy, some authors suggest that pangolin, mink, snake or turtle may be potential intermediate hosts for the virus [12\u201318].",

Both asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients can transmit the infection [19, 20] and the spread seems to occur mainly via droplets. Some authors detected peak concentration of the virus in upper airways before day 5 from the onset, with the shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasting the end of symptoms [20]. As far as clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pregnancy is concerned, currently we have very limited knowledge, but there is currently no evidence of vertical transmission during the third trimester [21].",

They considered asymptomatic those children with positive laboratory tests without any clinical signs or symptoms or radiological chest findings, mild those with symptoms of acute upper respiratory tract infection in the absence of auscultatory abnormalities or children with only digestive symptoms, and moderate those with pneumonia, but no obvious hypoxemia. The spectrum of manifestations observed in the pediatric age includes fever (frequently low grade), cough, pharyngeal erythema, tachycardia, and tachypnea, less usually rhinorrhea, diarrhea, vomiting, and fatigue [31]. Children may show a coinfection with other viral pneumonia, and in a series of 20 Chinese children eight showed a concomitant infection with influenza viruses A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae or cytomegalovirus [32]. The majority of pediatric patients have a normal blood count, with 15% showing leukocytosis and 15% leukopenia. CRP and ESR are also frequently in normal range [33]. Hence, while in adults lymphocyte and platelet counts, CRP, and albumin levels have been proposed as signs for severe infection, in children the potential prognostic value of these indicators is not clear [33]. Chest CT findings are documented in almost half of children, and appear to be similar, but milder when compared to those found in adults [33, 34]. Plain chest X-rays may fail to detect the lesions or may be unable the detail pathologic features [32].",

Lee et al. showed concerns on the risk of infections in JIA patients receiving TNF inhibitors [41]. They identified an increased risk of bacterial infections requiring hospitalization compared to DMARDs users, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.72 (95% CI: 1.08\u20136.86); however, they did not consider the possible influence of previous MTX treatment.",

Studies have demonstrated that both drugs in vitro are able to interfere with different viruses [50, 51]. In vitro CQ decreases the glycosylation of ACE2 hindering the entrance of the virus in the host cells. Furthermore, CQ and HCQ increase the pH of endosomes in cells preventing the fusion process between host and viral membrane [52]. HCQ therapy may be useful in COVID-19 infections not only for its anti-viral activity; the ability to decrease cytokine production, suppress TLR signaling, and decrease interferon pathway activation may dampen the inflammatory phase of the disease [52]. Finally, HCQ has also proven some efficacy in preventing recurrent acute respiratory distress syndrome in children with interstitial lung disease due to monogenic surfactant deficiency [53]. At least 16 different trials are ongoing in China, and six others are registered, for testing the efficacy of CQ and HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19. Preliminary results by Gautret et al. suggest that HCQ 600 mg daily may decrease viral load in nasal swabs [54]; furthermore, Gao reports that \u201cchloroquine phosphate is superior to the control treatment in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promoting a virus negative conversion, and shortening the disease course\u201d [55]. In a recent report Yao et al. have demonstrated in a pharmacokinetic model in vitro that HCQ is 3-times more potent than CQ; according to this study a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of HCQ given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is the therapeutic regimen recommended [56].",

Based upon these findings a single arm phase 2 study has also been approved by the Italian Regulatory Drug Agency and will enroll patients with pneumonia and early respiratory failure, with mortality reduction at 1 month as primary outcome (EudraCT number 2020\u2013001110-38). Participants will receive 1 dose of TCZ (8 mg/Kg), and a second dose could be given after 12 h if respiratory function has not recovered. In the U.S. another phase 2 trial with the IL-6 blocker Sarilumab is currently ongoing (NCT04315298).",

Emergency department visits have to be avoided unless strictly necessary, but the primary care physician or pediatrician should be contacted in case of fever or respiratory symptoms.

At the present time swabs are not prescribed for asymptomatic individuals, but screening on health care providers is discussed. These (ie ourselves) are the next most important people to protect, since everyday contact is allowed by definition for physicians and asymptomatic people could theoretically carry the virus and potentially be a contagious source, with dangerous spread not only for children but for family contacts and in particular elderly subjects who are at risk for severe course of disease.
