Droplets smaller than this size evaporate faster than they settle, forming droplet nuclei that can stay airborne for hours and may be transported over long distances.",

The first two routes associated with large droplets are referred to as the \"droplet\" and \"contact\" routes of transmission, whereas the third is the so-called \"airborne\" transmission route (Jones & Brosseau 2015) . Respiratory infections hijack our respiratory apparatus to increase the frequency and intensity of expiratory events such as coughing and sneezing, which are particularly effective in generating and dispersing virus-carrying droplets.",

            "text": "Each stage in the transmission process is mediated by complex flow phenomena ranging from air-mucous interaction, liquid sheet fragmentation, turbulent jets, and droplet evaporation and deposition, to flow-induced particle dispersion and sedimentation. Thus, flow-physics is central to the transmission of COVID-19. Furthermore, given the centrality of flow phenomena to the transmission process, the methods, devices and practices employed to mitigate respiratory infections are also rooted in the principles of fluid dynamics. These include simple methods such as handwashing and wearing face masks, to fogging machines, ventilation (Tang et al. 2006) and even practices such as social distancing. However, despite the long history of medical research and experience in the transmission of respiratory infections (a fascinating account of the Spanish Flu can be found in Soper (1919) ), the rapid advance of COVID-19 around the world, has laid bare the limits of our knowledge regarding the physics underlying the transmission process, as well as the inadequacy of the methods/devices/practices used to curtail transmission rates. For instance, one factor that is contributing to the rapid growth of COVID-19 infections is the higher viral load of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the upper respiratory tract of asymptomatic hosts who shed virus-laden droplets during normal activities such as talking and breathing (Bai et al. 2020) . This knowledge gap has also manifested through guidelines on practices such as social distancing and the wearing of face masks (Dwyer & Aubrey 2020; Elegant 2020), which are based on outdated science (Asadi et al. 2020; Bourouiba 2020; Anchordoqui & Chudnovsky 2020) .",

One important site for this mechanism is in the terminal bronchioles during breathing. These sub-millimeter sized passages collapse during exhalation and the subsequent reopening during inhalation ruptures the mucus meniscus, resulting in the generation of micronsized droplets (Almstrand et al. 2010; Johnson et al. 2011) . A similar mechanism likely occurs in the larynx during activities such as talking and coughing, which involve the opening and closing of the vocal folds (Mittal et al. 2013) . Finally, movement and contact of the tongue and lips, particularly during violent events such as sneezing, generates salivary droplets via this mechanism. The fluid dynamics of meniscus breakup associated with this mechanism are difficult to predict, especially given the non-Newtonian properties of the fluids involved, the dominant role of moving boundaries, and the large range of length-and time-scales involved in this phenomenon.",

A single sneeze can generate O(10 4 ) or more droplets with velocities upwards of 20 m/s (Han et al. 2013) . Coughing generates 10-100 times fewer droplets than sneezing with velocities of about 10 m/s, but even talking can generate about 50 particles per second (Asadi et al. 2019) . Measured droplet sizes range over four orders of magnitude: from O(0.1) to O(1000) microns. Recent studies have noted that while breathing generates droplets at a much lower rate, it likely accounts for more expired bioaerosols over the course of a day than intermittent events such as coughing and sneezing (Fiegel et al. 2006; Atkinson & Wein 2008) . Consensus on all these droplet characteristics continues to be elusive due to the multifactorial nature of the phenomena as well as the difficulty of making such measurements (Han et al. 2013; Chao et al. 2009; Morawska et al. 2009 ).",

Violent expiratory events like coughing and sneezing on the other hand generate turbulent jets with Reynolds numbers of O(10 4 ) and higher (Bourouiba et al. 2014) . Mucus and saliva that are expelled out of the nose and mouth can be stretched into ligaments and sheets and eventually fragmented into small droplets if the Weber number is large enough (Jain et al. 2015) . This breakup process likely contributes to the generation of large droplets that fall ballistically and contaminate nearby surfaces (Bourouiba et al. 2014 ).",

Subsequent analysis has shown that typical temperature and humidity variations expand the critical size range from about 50 to 150 microns (Xie et al. 2007) . For the droplet transmission route, an important consideration is the horizontal distance traveled by the large droplets. Thus the 3-6 ft. social distancing guidelines (WHO 2020; CDC 2020a) likely originate from Wells' original work. However, studies indicate that while this distance might be adequate for droplets expelled during breathing and coughing (Xie et al. 2007; Wei & Li 2015) , large droplets expelled from sneezes may travel 20 feet of more (Xie et al. 2007; Bourouiba et al. 2014) .

While large droplets are mostly not affected by the cloud dynamics, small and medium size droplets can be suspended in the turbulent cloud for a longer time by its circulatory flow, thereby extending the travel distance significantly (Bourouiba et al. 2014) . This also has important implications for transmission via indirect contact with contaminated surfaces and social distancing guidelines, since SARS-CoV-2 is able to survive on many types of surfaces for hours (van Doremalen et al. 2020) . The turbulent cloud also moves upward due to buoyancy (Bourouiba et al. 2014) , thereby enabling small droplets and droplet nuclei to reach heights where they can enter the ventilation system and accelerate airborne transmissions (see Sec. 2.5). The notion of a critical droplet size that was introduced by Wells (1934) might need to be reexamined in the light of our rapidly evolving knowledge about these expiratory events (Xie et al. 2007; Bourouiba et al. 2014 ).",

Thus, Reynolds, Nusselt, and Sherwood numbers for the droplets are just some of the non-dimensional parameters that determine this phenomenon (Xie et al. 2007 ). This dependence of evaporation rates on the ambient temperature and humidity has implications for the very important, and yet unresolved questions regarding seasonal and geographic variations in transmission (Tang 2009; Ma et al. 2020 ) rates as well as transmission in various indoor environments (Tang et al. 2006; Li et al. 2007) .",

This is not only due to the fact that these factors modulate the relative importance of the droplet and airborne routes of transmission, but also because survivability of enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 seem to be linked to these factors in a complex, non-monotonic manner (Geller et al. 2012) .

The deposition of a solid particle is governed primarily by the mechanism of transport, whereas for liquid aerosols, the evaporation/diffusion process contributes significantly to the deposition mechanism. The latter is, however, a complex subject and has not been studied extensively so far (Rostami 2009 ). There are six mechanisms that determine the deposition location: impaction, sedimentation, interception, diffusion, electrostatic precipitation, and convection (Hinds 1999) . The relative importance of these mechanisms depends on the particle size and the region of the airway where deposition occurs. In general, for larger particles, impaction, sedimentation, and interception are more important than diffusion and convection (Rostami 2009 ). For droplet-nuclei-sized particles, sedimentation will drive significant deposition in the upper respiratory tract of the host ).",

For small droplets, deposition relies completely on turbulent diffusion (Friedlander & Johnstone 1957) but for large droplets, the deposition velocity increases substantially due to impact on the highly-curved and complex passage walls of the respiratory tract. Large droplets, despite a higher deposition velocity, likely deposit in the upper respiratory system, and could be deactivated by the first defensive layer of the mucosa (Fokkens & Scheeren 2000) .

Thus, with a reasonably well fit face mask, inward protection depends primarily on the face mask filter material. In this regard, an important characteristic of a face mask is the dependence of filtration efficiency on particle size. Studies (Chen & Willeke 1992; Weber et al. 1993; Baazy et al. 2006) have shown that for a given filter, there is an intermediate particle size where filtration efficiency is minimum. Below this size, electrostatic attraction (active for masks such as N95) and diffusion dominate filtration, whereas above this size, impaction and interception are the dominant mechanisms. Aerosolized virus-laden droplets and droplet nuclei vary in size from sub-micron to millimeters and therefore the aforementioned size-dependent filtration efficiency is an important consideration for inward protection against COVID-19 infections. An increase in fiber density to enhance filtration efficiency is accompanied by an increased pressure drop across the mask (Lai et al. 2012) , which requires a greater inhalation effort by the wearer. Thus, an appropriate balance has to be achieved via proper design of the filter material, and this might be particularly important in the post COVID-19 era, if wearing face masks becomes routine.",

This fluid-structure interaction problem is mediated by the structural design as well as the permeability of the mask. The leakage jets that issue from the perimeter can be turbulent and highly directed (see for example, the flow visualization in Tang et al.

The study was extremely inventive but mostly qualitative, and future experiments should provide quantitative analysis of the leakage and throughflow jets, the aerosol dispersion through these jets, as well as the deformation of the mask during a variety of expiratory events. Recent CFD studies of face mask aerodynamics (Lei et al. 2013; Hua Zhu et al. 2016 ) demonstrate the potential of computational modeling for this problem, but there is a critical need for modeling flow-induced billowing and associated leakage enhancement during expiratory events. Ultimately, analysis should not only enable a detailed evaluation of the protective efficiency of face masks; it should drive design changes that enhance mask performance and provide data that informs guidelines on practices such as social distancing.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed significant scientific gaps in our understanding of critical issues ranging from transmission pathways of such respiratory diseases, to the strategies use for mitigating these transmissions. This article summarizes a fluid dynamicists' perspective on important aspects of the problem, including respiratory droplet formation, two-phase expiratory flows, droplet evaporation and transport, and face mask aerodynamics. COVID-19 touches almost every major arena of fluid dynamics, from hydrodynamic instability to porous-media and turbulent shear flows, from droplet breakup to particle deposition, and from Newtonian gas flows to non-Newtonian liquids. For the topics that we have discussed, breadth and medical context have taken precedence over a detailed exposition. COVID-19 has thrust the field of fluid dynamics into the public eye in a way (Parshina-Kottas et al. 2020; Bourouiba 2020) not seen since the space race of the 1960s. Our hope is that not only will this article serve as a call-to-arms to fluid dynamicists, it will also provide a starting point for the researcher who is motivated to tackle the science of COVID-19, and other similar diseases that are sure to appear in the not-too-distant future.",
