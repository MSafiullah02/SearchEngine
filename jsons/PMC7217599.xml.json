Under infectious and non-infectious inflammatory conditions, the GPI moiety that anchors uPAR to the cell is cleaved, and this leads to the release of suPAR. suPAR may be detected in serum, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid and urine and is a marker of disease severity. suPAR has a secondary structure of 17 anti-parallel \u03b2-sheets with 3 short \u03b1-helices. There are three homologous domains of suPAR: DI, DII and DIII. Comparing cDNA sequences, DI differs from DII and DIII in its primary and tertiary structure, yielding its distinct ligand-binding properties. We currently know that suPAR is a non-specific marker and that many conditions, both acute and chronic, may affect serum levels [1].",

Among these diseases are chronic autoimmune disorders, solid tumour malignancies and chronic heart failure. More precisely, the activation of uPAR takes place at the level of the cell membrane of chondrocytes and osteocytes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and mediated bone resorption [2]. suPAR is increased in patients with colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer and prostate cancer, and it is an indicator of unfavourable prognosis [3]. The implication of the uPAR/suPAR activation in malignancy is so well studied that it is even considered a novel therapeutic target [4]. Understanding of the implication of suPAR as an early prognostic marker in patients with malignancy is coming from Greece. Starting from a small number of patients who comprised a derivation cohort, the prognostic value of suPAR was studied in a validation cohort of 267 patients all suffering from chronic liver disorders. Patients with active hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were excluded from the study. Enrolled patients were classified as low (n = 75) or high risk (n = 192) for the development of HCC according to the criteria of the European Association for the Study of the Liver. Among those at high risk, concentrations of suPAR were greater in the group of patients who eventually developed HCC within the next 7 years. A cut-off point of 9.56 ng/ml had 90.4% sensitivity and 96.4% negative predictive value for the development of HCC within the next 7 years [5].",

The rate toward decrease of the baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR) over the first decade of follow-up was greater among patients in the last quartile. More precisely, the annual change of GFR was \u2212 0.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 among patients in the first quartile and \u2212 4.2 ml/min/1.73 m2 among patients in the fourth quartile [6]. The same four quartiles of suPAR are also predictive of the risk of developing acute renal injury among patients who undergo coronary angiography as a result of the contrast material used during this procedure [7]. The deterioration of renal function may come from the formation of complexes between suPAR and \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrins on renal podocytes. This interaction is further enhanced among African Americans who carry the high-risk APOL1 genotype [8]. This effect on the glomeruli leading to proteinuria is consistent with the recently reported greater values of suPAR among patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis [9].",

DEPT consists of a combined assessment of vital signs and symptoms and classifies patients into categories: Red (highest risk of death the next 7 days), Orange, Yellow and Green (least risk for death the next 7 days). suPAR was measured in 4420 patients and improved the prognostic performance of DEPT by moving more patients into the Red and Orange categories so that the area under the curve for 7-day mortality (receiver-operator characteristic analysis) of suPAR combined with DEPT was 0.81 compared with 0.71 for DEPT only [10]. A post-hoc analysis of the data of the TRIAGE III trial revealed that among patients who were discharged the first 24 h, the range of suPAR was between 2.6 and 4.7 ng/ml in 30-day survivors and between 6.7 and 11.8 ng/ml in 30-day non-survivors [11]. These data support that concentrations of suPAR < 4 ng/ml are interpreted as normal and allow safe patient discharge from the ED. Concentrations > 6 ng/ml are indicative of substantial risk of death. A grey zone remains for patients with values between 4 and 6 ng/ml [12].",

Both studies were conducted before 2016, so sepsis classification was done according to the 2003 criteria. The first study enrolled 180 patients with sepsis developing in the field of ventilator-associated pneumonia who were hospitalized in two Intensive Care Units (ICUs). suPAR was measured for 7 consecutive days. Concentrations were significantly greater among patients with severe sepsis and septic shock than among those with uncomplicated sepsis. When analysis was done for the prognosis of outcome, it was found that suPAR > 12.9 ng/ml was an independent predictor of unfavourable outcome; serum levels remained stable over the disease course. suPAR was also detected in the supernatants of isolated neutrophils of the first day of symptoms, indicating this cell type as a main reservoir of production [14].",

            "text": "The most critical element of sepsis management is the early administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy. This knowledge was developed from a retrospective analysis of 2713 patients in septic shock. The start of antibiotic treatment the first hour from onset of hypotension was accompanied by 79.1% survival after 28 days; each hour of delay was accompanied by a 7.6% decrease of the chances of survival [16]. This mandates the early recognition of severe infection. This is easier when signs of sepsis exist and far more difficult for patients with unspecific complaints. Since the introduction of the Sepsis-3 definitions in 2016, qSOFA (quick SOFA score) has been introduced as an early warning score in the ED. qSOFA screens for the presence of tachypnoea defined as > 22 breaths/min, mental confusion defined as Glasgow Coma Scale < 13 and hypotension defined as systolic blood pressure < 100 mmHg. Every patient who presents at least two of these signs has at least 10% risk of death after 28 days, whatever is defined with 90% sensitivity [17]. According to recently published data of the HSSG, even patients with a qSOFA score of 1 have a significant risk for 28-day unfavourable outcome [18]. This generates the question of whether suPAR may help trace the patients among those with one sign of qSOFA at significantly greater risk of death compared with those with one sign of qSOFA but without increased suPAR. This is the rationale of the SUPERIOR trial that is running in two study sites of the HSSG (EudraCT no. 2018-001008-13; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03717350) [19]. In this ongoing study, enrolled patients are adults with clinical suspicion of an infection, one sign of qSOFA and suPAR \u2265 12 ng/ml. Patients with two or three signs of qSOFA, transplanted patients, patients with full-blown sepsis and patients with no resuscitation decision are excluded. Enrolled patients are randomized to blind treatment with placebo or with one single infusion of 2 g meropenem. Then, patients are returned to the triage queue already set for them. Primary study endpoint according to the last revision of the study protocol is the early worsening of the patient defined as any at least one point increase of the admission total SOFA score in the first 24 h. Main secondary study endpoints are (1) the early worsening of the patient analyzed separately per quartile of the total SOFA score of the patient population and (2) 7-, 28-, 60- and 90-day mortality.",
