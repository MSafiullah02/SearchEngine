WHO estimates that invasive pneumococcal infection results in an estimated 1.6 million deaths every year [2]. Thus pneumococcal diseases remain to be a major global-health issue. For many years, it is well known that antiphagocytic polysaccharide capsule is the most important virulence factor of S. pneumoniae\n[3]. Over the past 20 years, the importance of pneumococcal proteins for the virulence of S. pneumoniae has been clarified, either as mediators of inflammation or by directly attacking host tissues [3], [4]. Pneumococcus has a significant attenuation of virulence by mutation of the genes encoding pneumococcal virulence proteins [3]. Therefore, pneumococcal virulence proteins play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of pneumococcal infections. And a comprehensive understanding of the interaction between pneumococcal virulence proteins and host cells may be helpful for the development of novel therapeutic agents against pneumococcal infections.",

PspA is a choline-binding surface protein, and it is composed of five domains: a signal peptide, an \u03b1-helical domain, a proline-rich region, a choline-binding domain, and a C-terminal tail [6]. PspA is presented on the surface of all pneumococcus, but it is highly variable. Based on the sequences of the N-terminal, PspA can be grouped into three families and can be further subdivided into six different clades [7]. PspA is a lactoferrin-binding protein and S. pneumoniae may overcome the iron limitation through lactoferrin-PspA interaction [8], it can also reduce the amount of C3b deposited onto pneumococcus and antibodies to PspA could increase complement activation and C3 deposition [9]. Shaper M et al demonstrated that PspA could protect S. pneumoniae from killing by apolactoferrin and anti-PspA antibodies could enhance killing of pneumococcus by apolactoferrin [8]. A recent study indicated that PspA contributed to secondary S. pneumoniae infection after influenza virus infection [10]. PspA has a great potential to be an effective vaccine candidate and systemic or mucosal immunization with PspA could elicit effective protection against pneumococccal infections [5], [11]. The capacity of PspA to protect against pneumococcal diseases remains to be determined but will have important implications for pneumococcal vaccine development.",

Upon pneumococcus\u2019s entry into the bloodstream, invasive pneumococcal infection is likely regulated through contact with naive monocytes, resulting in the activation of monocytes and an inflammatory response and the final opsonin-dependent phagocytosis [1], [3].

Among the virulence proteins of S. pneumoniae, It is known that PspA is a surface-exposed protein and may be secreted in vivo [17]. PspA has been known to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of invasive pneumococcal infection. Previous studies demonstrated that opaque strains showed improved survival in the bloodstream and bear more of the protective antigen PspA [18]. Furthermore, Ogunniyi AD et al found that the expression of PspA was up-regulated threefold at 12 h post-infection and was 36-fold higher at 24 h post-infection [19].",

However, PspA could not activate human monocytes to secrete TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and CCL3. The explanation may be that PspA can not activate their gene transcriptions and selectively regulate the induction of different cytokines and chemokines by activation of different transcription factors. Although CCS containing a variety of native components released from PspA-deficient mutant pneumococcus that did not express PspA could induce significantly more secretion of these mediators than that of control medium, the secretion of these mediators was significantly less than that of CCS from wild type pneumococcus. Since CCS from PspA-deficient mutant pneumococcus was absent of full or truncated PspA confirmed by Western blot, we can conclude that native PspA of pneumococcus is an inducer of IL-6, CXCL8, CCL2, CCL4 and CCL5. In addition, given the known polymorphic variation in PspA between different pneumococcal strains, further studies are required to explore the impact of such differences on the secretion of IL-6, CXCL8, CCL2, CCL4 and CCL5.",

It induces the synthesis of acute-phase proteins and regulates various immune and inflammatory responses [20]. A previous study has demonstrated that IL-6 was one of the essential cytokines to induce the differentiation of IL-17-producing human Th cells [21]. Since IL-17A was shown to increase pneumococcal killing by human neutrophils [21], IL-6 may therefore play an important role in mediating pneumococcal immunity in humans. Among chemokines induced by PspA, CCL2 is a chemoattractant for monocytes. Beside, CCL2 can also induce the release of lysosomal enzymes, production of superoxide anions and expression of cytokines and chemokines from macrophage [22]. CCL2 overexpressing mice showed an improved pneumococcal clearance and survival, and that was associated with substantially increased lung mononuclear phagocyte subset accumulations [23]. CXCL8 can regulate various biological functions of neutrophils including chemotaxis, degranulation, superoxide production, and expression of adhesion molecules [24]. CCL4 preferentially attracts CD4+T cells, and it is also involved in the activation of human granulocytes and seems to be involved in acute neutrophilic inflammation [22]. CCL5 is chemotactic for T-cells, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils and plays an active role in recruiting these leukocytes into inflammatory sites [22]. Taken together, these inflammatory factors induced by PspA may regulate the initiation, maintenance, and termination of inflammatory reactions in invasive pneumococcal infection.",

To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we examined the role of NF-kB and MAPKs pathways using a pharmacological approach. PspA-induced secretion of IL-6, CXCL8, CCL2, CCL4 and CCL5 was significantly decreased by I\u03baB-\u03b1 and MAP kinase inhibitors, suggesting the involvement of these pathways in pneumococcal inflammatory diseases.

These results indicated that all the three MAPK pathways and NF-\u03baB pathway were partly but not predominantly involved in this induction.

            "text": "Elevated expression of intracellular phosphorylated MAPK proteins is a hallmark for the activation of MAPK signaling pathways [31]. In NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of the NF-\u03baB inhibitor I\u03baB\u03b1 is required to allow NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation. NF-\u03baB is sequestered in the cytoplasm through their association with the inhibitor protein I\u03baB\u03b1. When I\u03baB\u03b1 is phosphorylated and degraded by proteasome, free NF-\u03baB translocates into the nucleus to regulate gene expression [32]. Using intracellular staining by flow cytometry and Western blot to investigate the phosphorylation levels of signaling molecules in monocytes, we confirmed that PspA could induce the phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, p38 MAPK and I\u03baB-\u03b1 in human monocytes, suggesting that pneumococcal PspA could activate ERK, JNK, p38 MAPK and NF-kB signaling pathways. NF-\u03baB- and MAPKs-dependent chemokine synthesis in human antigen-presented dendritic cells in response to pneumococcal proteins pneumolysin and choline binding protein A (CbpA) has also been reported [26]. Therefore, the activated NF-\u03baB and MAPKs signaling pathways are involved in pneumococcal infection. In fact, enhanced phospho-p38 MAPK expression in mononuclear cells has been investigated in severe acute respiratory syndrome [27]. Therefore, a better understanding of the signaling pathways involved in invasive pneumococcal infection may be important for developing strategies to reduce the septic inflammation associated with invasive pneumococcal infection.",

            "text": "Previous reports have demonstrated that many different pneumococcal proteins have the capability to induce the release of pro-inflammatory mediators. For example, recombinant CbpA could induce increased secretion of CXCL8, CCL2, CXCL1, and CXCL5 and increase the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) in the human alveolar epithelial cell line (A549 cell) [28]. Pneumolysin can induce the expression of NO, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and COX-2 in RAW 264.7 macrophages [29]. Esterase A (EstA) of pneumococcus is an inducer of NO and TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 mRNA in RAW 264.7 macrophages [30]. Ferreira et al recently reported that PspA is a novel inducer of IL-17 and IFN-\u03b3, two important cytokines which are involved in protection effects against pneumococcal infection [11]. However, this is the first study shown that PspA could stimulate the release of IL-6, CXCL8, CCL2, CCL4, and CCL5 from human peripheral blood monocytes via intracellular NF-\u03baB and MAPKs signaling pathways. It is suggested that pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines differentially regulate an in vivo humoral response to S. pneumoniae\n[3]. In fact, a complex series of interactions among immune, epithelial and vascular system cells, as well as pneumococcal virulence factors seems to be responsible for the outcome of invasive pneumococcal infection. As one of the most important virulence factors of pneumococcus, this study on PspA provides new insight for PspA-mediated activation of monocytes via differential intracellular signaling cascades in pneumococcal infection, and the work for identifying potential recognition receptor of PspA on human monocytes is ongoing. Our present findings may also have important implications in the development of effective vaccines or other therapeutic agents against pneumococcal infection.",
