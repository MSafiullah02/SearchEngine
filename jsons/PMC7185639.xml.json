Infection by microorganisms can result in serious problems such as food poisoning, enteritis, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [1], [2], [3]. Numerous antimicrobial methods, such as filtration [4], [5], thermal treatment [6], [7], antibiotic agents [8], [9], disinfectants [10], and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation [11], [12], have been studied and evaluated for their effectiveness against different microorganisms under varying environmental conditions. Interestingly, however, these studies have been mostly dedicated to the non-selective inactivation of microorganisms. Most methods for microorganism sterilization are non-specific, and therefore, useful microorganisms are killed alongside target microorganisms.",

            "text": "Titanium oxide (TiO2), a photocatalyst, has been widely used in environmental fields due to its high chemical stability, excellent oxidation capability, good photocatalytic activity, low-cost of production, and non-toxicity [13], [14]. In addition, TiO2 photocatalysis has been intensively applied to the inactivation of a broad spectrum of microorganisms [15], [16], [17]. It has already been demonstrated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydroxyl radicals (OH\u2022) and superoxide anions (O2\n\u2022\n\u2212), produced by the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 under UV irradiation, are reactive with microorganisms and can kill or deactivate bacteria, viruses, and cells more efficiently than UV alone [17], [18], [19]. Recently, this enhanced photocatalytic and antibacterial activity was demonstrated using TiO2 particles loaded with metal oxides (Ag, Au, or Cu) or graphene under visible light [20], [21], [22], [23]. However, previous studies of TiO2 and modified TiO2 photocatalysts showed no selectivity for target microorganisms where ROS were applied to such processes [12], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. A small number of studies have been conducted on the bioconjugation of TiO2 with DNA, biotin, or antibodies; however, these studies did not focus on the selective inactivation of bacterial targets [26], [27], [28], [29].",

Raw TiO2 particles were precipitated after a few minutes, whereas PAA-coated TiO2 particles remained homogeneously suspended in water for several hours.

The antibacterial activity of target-specific TiO2-AbE to E. coli was substantially enhanced compared to TiO2 synthesized using the vapor condensation method or vanadium pentoxide-loaded TiO2, which were synthesized for the enhanced catalytic activity of P25-TiO2 and did not have bacterial target specificity [32], [33].",

The enhanced inactivation of target bacteria in a mixed population implied that TiO2-AbE binds specifically to its target, E. coli, in a mixed bacterial population, with little non-specific binding to non-target bacteria. Thus, accumulation of TiO2 particles around the target cell surface enhanced the inactivation of target bacterial cells in a mixed population.",

In the presence of UV, TiO2-AbE enhanced the photokilling of E. coli specifically and had no significant photokilling effect on non-target. We suspected that the close contact of TiO2 particles with bacterial cells, due to the high binding affinity of the conjugated receptors to their targets, may enhance ROS transfer to the bacterial surface, resulting in the enhancement of photokilling activity, although the oxidation ability of PAA-coated TiO2 was weaker than that of raw TiO2. TiO2-AbE also inactivated E. coli more efficiently than non-target bacteria in a mixed population. The strategy presented in this study will facilitate the combination of other receptors with TiO2 particles for preparation of highly selective and photocatalytic composites or antibacterial coating materials to remediate a wide variety of natural and man-made systems from contamination by unwanted organisms.",
