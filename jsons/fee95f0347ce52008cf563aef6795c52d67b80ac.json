There is a huge anthropomorphic prejudice that although life is unlikely, the just-right Goldilocks terrestrial conditions mean that the just-right balance of minerals and basic small molecules inevitably result in life as we know it throughout our solar system, galaxy, and the rest of the universe. Moreover, when such conditions on planets such as ours may not be quite right for the origin of life, it is popularly opined that asteroids and comets magically produce life or at the very least, the important, if not crucial components of terrestrial life so that life then blooms, when their fragments cruise the solar system, stars, and galaxies, and plummet onto appropriately bedecked planets and moons.",

This led to widespread provincial limited unscientific deficiencies to grasp intelligence and life in the universe. However, many ancient Greek and modern scientists and technologists opposed such views. As investigations commence of locales outside our terrestrial and solar system environments, we need to re-examine fundamental assumptions, hypotheses, and directions. Key concerns in such explorations include unnecessary human life endangerment, global wastefulness, improvidence, duplicative financial cost, and huge irresponsible toxic accumulation of terrestrial and space junk. This chapter contends that unrelenting development of AI, QC, and intelligent robotics for extraterrestrial exploration will remove human risk and endangerment from the equation, as well as reduce global costs.)

However, artefacts produced by severe heating when such objects fall through planetary atmospheres, and survive impact without complete annihilation, become questions of credibility and require additional support studies. Subsequently, how convincing is the claim for microfossils in such circumstances? Moreover, when falling onto planets or moons that are devoid of any atmospheres, such as the Moon, it is anticipated that such fossils will be more likely to survive under those conditions. To wit, if Martian microfossils have fallen to Earth, then as a control, should we not detect a plethora of such fossils on our Moon, which, after all, has weaker gravitation, negligible atmosphere, and a softer powdery regolith. An in depth analysis of the degree of flaw of claimed microfossil findings in terrestrial Martian rocks, is provided by Grady et al., who ask the question: \"Martian meteorites are ancient microfossils. Do the data demand faith, hope, or charity?\" Based on questions of chemical analysis techniques, generated artefacts in these fallen objects, and methods of evaluation, Grady et al. oppose the microfossil conclusion purported findings. It should be noted that as of January 2019, 224 of 61,000 (0.4%) meteorites that fell to Earth were ejected from Mars [23, 24] .

Exploration of the Moon commenced some 50 years ago. In 1969 In , 1971 , and 1972, six Apollo missions 11, 12, 14, 15, 16 , and 17 landed on the moon and exhibited problems with lunar dust contamination of personnel clothing, space suits, and space vehicle cabins. Ubiquitous dangerous and deleterious effects of lunar dust were included in ten categories: inhalation and irritation, vision obscuration, false instrument readings, dust coating and contamination, astronaut space suit surfaces, loss of traction, thermal control problems, abrasion, clogging of mechanisms, and ball-bearing and seal failures. There were no effective procedures available to diminish the most serious problems of abrasion, clogging, and weakened heat rejection. The authors concluded that prior studies of these problems had been insufficient, so that additional studies will be needed prior to returning to the Moon and similarly prior to exploring Mars, if that is done. 21st Century ultra-sterile futuristic BSL-4 methods to prevent material and biological contamination should be used [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] .",

            "text": "Immanuel Kant, in the 18th century (in 1755), first proposed that the solar system condensed from gases and particles. In this theory, he relies on the concept of the atom derived from Lucretius in combination with the application of Newton's laws of gravitation, leading to processes of condensation [49] . The work of Immanuel Kant set the stage for subsequent inferences to be based on planetary evolutionary phenomena, leading to the origin of life. The evolution of carbon-containing molecules is of subsequent relevance in terms of possibly detecting Goldilocks-zone hypothesized Earth-like life, as advanced in the 20th century. The analyses of the Murchison and many other carbonaceous chondrites have been typical study foci. However, the question as to the survival of organic prebiological compounds continues to be a prime question in studies related to the origin of life in the solar system, as well. For example, carbonaceous chondrites have been sources of amino acids, purines, and perhaps some pyrimidines. Do they reflect conditions related to the origin of life or synthesis during transit to the earth's surface? [50] [51] [52] [53] . First, were compounds continually produced during the early history of the solar system (e.g. during the first Gyr) and then, second, various conditions would degrade and destroy these compounds (e.g. heat, impacts, radiation, radioactivity, ultraviolet light, cosmic rays, and solar wind.) Olivine basalt was returned from the lunar regolith to the Cornell University Space Center Planetary Laboratory (Ithaca, NY) and was pulverized and then mixed with amino acids. These mixtures were subjected to lunar surface proton irradiation, temperature, and high vacuum, and resulted in complete amino acid destruction, in entirety, in 5-cm mixture columns. The half-life of the amino acids was calculated at 4000 years [54] .",

However, if it were solar system-wide, then did this occur in two phases for the Venus, Earth, and Mars? First as the planetary material precursors and compounds accreted, then when some planetary critical mass was attained resulting in volcanism and melting, consequent concomitant destruction of biological compounds ensued. Next, was it only after some level of cooling that there was in situ synthesis of protobiologicals on the Earth (and Venus and Mars) as well as raining down of such molecules, as described by Chyba and Sagan in1974 [48] .",

Be that as it may, Loeb proposed that because at a redshift of 100-137, because the cosmic background temperature was 273-373 \u00b0K, (thus, a widespread Goldilocks universe) organic molecules could have formed and perhaps life originated, though at that early stage of development of the expansion of the universe (only 10-17 million years of age) [55] . Using this slant, there could have been very early widespread origins of life over several million years, prior to the further cooling and evolution of the universe, towards what we observe today.

Accordingly, note then, that at some stages of evolution, some prokaryote nucleated cells interacted with mitochondrial symbionts and others with both mitochondrial and plastid endosymbionts. The endosymbiont origin hypotheses were originated by Mereschkowsky in 1905 and championed by Margulis since 1967 [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] . Extra-solar system life searches utilize panels of sophisticated experiments available to establish the presence of many types of chemical reactions, pre-and postorigin of life, depending on the states of development, where exploratory vehicles land. Of under-rated importance, there should be improved biocontainment procedures in place to avoid upsetting and perturbing the evolution of life in such environments. As technology improves and further exploratory vehicles are sent, the danger of biocontamination becomes even greater. Each exploratory vehicle should have a probability value (p-value) attached -which should be lower than some crucial value that should be determined with appropriate scientific investigation. Many control experiments are required to fully investigate such potential contamination outcomes. The degrees of complexity involved additionally require AI and QC to accomplish such difficult and multifaceted tasks without destroying such environments.

On the one hand, prion proteins are produced from coding DNA exons; on the other hand, infectious prions can induce malformation of correctly folded proteins into misfolded neuropathological prions. This transformation is associated with a variety of human and animal diseases that have been carefully and scientifically studied since the early 20th century. Moreover, many proteins have prion-like sequences and may additionally participate in various disease processes. Unanticipated, amyloid fibril fatal associated involvement in Alzheimer's disease, may involve synergistic action with prions. Further relevant to Astrovirology, there is negligible immune response to prion disease itself (transmissible encephalopathies) in the natural setting. If anything, incipient immune reactions promote replication and spread of prion disease [28, [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] . Thus, exovirology portends unanticipated elevated health risks for human exploration, should life and viruses be discovered elsewhere.",

Across the last 560 million years (MY), the mass extinction names and approximate dates are late-Ordovician, 440 MY ago; late-Devonian, 370-350 MY ago; end-Permian, 250 MY ago; end-Triassic, 199 MY ago; and end-Cretaceous, 65 MY ago. How such cataclysmic events terminate life is under study. For loss of life, a 'trigger' mechanism is separated conceptually from a 'kill' mechanism. Trigger mechanisms are whatever events (e.g. asteroids) cause or initiate kill mechanisms. An interesting example, though subtle, is a kill mechanism proposed when atmospheric partial pressure pCO 2 levels of 560 ppmv are associated with an oceanic toxic pH of 7.9. This level can be reached both from below and from above [109] . Subsequent to each extinction event, the fundamental building blocks and biochemistry of life persisted, as some organisms survived and continued to evolve each time. A question posed is to what extent intelligent life evolved prior to or after each extinction event. However, the consensus appears to be that highest intelligence was attained after the fifth extinction, with the rise of mammals, primates, and humans. What about extinction events in our scientific exploration of extra-solar system life? Our explorations necessitate including methods to ascertain whether extinction events have taken place, if our arrival is in the midst of such an event, and whether our arrival itself may cause such events. Dealing with questions of contamination is crucial. The footprint impacts of our exploration and arrival elsewhere should be explored scientifically.",

This approach is not as straight forward as it once appeared because all life on the planet is divided among three groups (Archaebacteria, Eubacteria, and Eukaryotes), which occupy ranges of several extreme environmental niches, and utilize many different and disparate energy sources. The unity of life derived from a single lineage is a charismatic hypothesis but not yet really scientifically fully proven [68, 72] . Be that as it may, it is not an optimally scientific tactic in the exploration of the universe, like looking in a mirror, to pursue evidence only for what we already presuppose to know. Chemistry, biochemistry, physics, and thermodynamics need to be examined in concert, since that will improve the chances of detecting life of any sort, without prior prejudice. Fractal forms and symmetries should be compared among various environments. Possibly fractal forms in differentiated environments may be able to discriminate the presence or absence of life. Various principles have been formulated [82, 102] . Statistical analysis and dynamics has become much more complex, including chaos theory and fractals vs. the methods of the last century, such as Gibbs, Maxwell, and Boltzmann theory. The need to utilize new methods looms over future life studies and exploration of exobiology/virology [83] [84] [85] .",

An equation was postulated to calculate probabilities for life on Earth. The possibility of material exchange among planets was used to enhance the probability of abiogenesis. However, a Bayesian approach came to the conclusion that despite the existence of life on the Earth, it remains an extremely unlikely event. Moreover, it should be noted that earlier speculations considered that life resembling known terrestrial biochemistry was unlikely [9, 11, 68, 104, 105] .

This is shown to be feasible using an equivalent to a 1 Watt 1 nm channel laser light in juxtaposition between stars such as the Sun and alpha-Centauri.

However, an unanticipated novel object, 1I/2017 U1, was observed during several nights in October 2017, which twice transited the plane of the solar system, traveling at anomalously high velocity, in an unusual orbit. 1I/2017 U1 is the first object recognized as an extra-solar system visitor. It was suggested that due to various complex calculations, such interstellar visitors have been missed previously. However, it could not be traveled to by direct means. 1I/2017 U1 was initially identified as probably an asteroid, but not a comet. It traversed our solar system with a jolt from the Sun that assisted its hyperbolic exit. It was oblong shaped, with axes that were 200 by 20 meters. Spectroscopic analysis indicated it had a red color, coated with damaged or degraded organic molecules of some kind, and possibly hollow (perhaps with or without trapped internal ice). It was also reported that, unfortunately, we did not have any rockets prepared, which could reach the object and place a probe on it to plot its path as it exited the Solar system beyond visual range. Could laser technology have been used to extend the tracking range [122] [123] [124] . Currently, analysis continues for the 4 days of observational data produced from this extra-solar system object. It is most recently considered to have a spotty red color or graded red color scheme. The analysis of this color issue also involves concluding that it has a tumble rate that influences the apparent color analysis. Moreover, 1I/2017 U1 may have been involved in a collision in the distant past, perhaps the cause of its expulsion from the solar system from which it originated [125] . Analysis of the object for signs or signatures of life remain indefinite. Loeb, in 2018, [126] proposed an artificial extraterrestrial interstellar origin for 1I/2017 U1. Of further interest is the proposal of a few stars, originally, calculated to within 2 pc of 1I/2017 U1 as possible prior sources with ranges of distance and travel times of 0.6 pc at 1 Mya and 1.6 pc at 3.8 Mya [127] . However, it is as yet not anticipated which star, previously to that or originally, may have given rise to 1I/2017 U1. (How old is it? Could it be an intergalactic as well as an interstellar messenger?)",

The paradigm suggested for exobiological exploration is to: (1) first produce the robotics (including universal construction), vehicles, communication skills, AI, and QC necessary to analyze, select, and focus on extrasolar planets for detecting intelligence, life, and viruses; (2) This should be done at the feasible distant limits of our solar system; (3) Next, send all these and all necessary probes and landers to various targets and groups of targets (which by then may have different priorities compared to what we know currently); (4) Interstellar space is cold so that with long range communications, QCs that may require cold environments to function, could be stationed at suitable distances from stars. Calculations will be performed at central hubs during extra-solar system investigations; (5) Orbit the selected targets (stars, planets, or other objects); (6) Assess the presence of intelligence 6 and decide whether to exit or proceed with communications and/or direct exploration; (7) Then, map the targets and analyze them across several wavelengths (X-ray, IR, and visible spectra) and sound, and detect atmospheric chemistry, biochemistry, and particulates (including odors); (8) Send the lander vehicles that will contain the apparatus required to carry out the experiments; (9) All the while, communication links will be maintained; (9) Include detection of migrant planets and planetoids within and outside of solar systems; (10) Along the way, consider the prospect that other such investigations may be taking place. (11) Last and not least, definitely, the appropriate parallel controls for all components of such missions will be continued in suitable places within our solar system, evolving here while the missions evolve distantly during the investigations.",

Suttle and others had previously point out that there are approximately 10 30 viruses, currently, in the Earth's oceans and that viruses have a huge impact globally -that they exhibit the widest genetic diversity on Earth, cause mortality, affect phytoplankton (one of the bases of the ecosystem and food chain on the planet), and drive geochemical cycles. Gonzalez recently pointed out, in a more restricted sense, that although Arrhenius' original canonical panspermia hypothesis in unlikely, what he terms as lithopanspermia of microorganisms that are endolithic and evolve in the same solar system, have increased positive consideration. In addition, terrestrial endolithic life shows unanticipated propensities to survive in caves and other hostile environments [106, 107, [142] [143] [144] [145] [146] .",

Once created, through what is termed the Weak force (W \u00b1 and Z 0 Bosons), although much lighter, compared to all the other known particles, neutrinos crisscross the universe, rarely interacting with matter. However, they can metamorphose into each other, in transit, called oscillations, and have internal 'clocks', governing them when to do so. Be that as it may, at the Big Bang, apparently though, a special fourth neutrino was produced that is different from the electron, muon, and tau neutrinos, and has been navigating the universe for 14 billion years since the Big Bang [160] [161] [162] [163] [164] [165] [166] [167] [168] . All in all, the universe is bathed in several generations and epochs of neutrinos and they are currently being mapped and characterized with a high level of interest. 7 The fundamental unitary matrix equation describing neutrino oscillations in terms of their flavors, generations, and masses is:",

On the other hand, we should not assume it is safe to collide with similar or different forms of life as we and or our machines travel elsewhere. The identification of Goldilocks zone worlds does not self-evidently support the assumption of life, but is indicative, rather, of our possible ability to live on such worlds, hopefully without damaging them. Space agencies and their governments have been well aware of the problems of biological contamination from Earth of extraterrestrial places to be visited and explored. Improved priorities and regulation were set [179, 180] .",

Examples of problems already in progress include innumerable artificial satellites orbit the Earth, many have been sent to orbit Mars, the Moon, and other planets, asteroids, and comets, etc. and many probes have crashed or landed on Mars, the Moon, as well as other objects, and several have been propelled out of the solar system. Consequently, these need to be fully catalogued and inventoried to ascertain more fully the extent of the contamination by terrestrial microorganisms and materials that contaminated these probes. This microbial contamination problem is being addressed from a peer review and public perspective and should be corrected before further exacerbations of the problems are continued [181, 182] .",

In addition, some Martian and terrestrial organisms could produce new life forms (by synergistic (symbiotic) interactions as well as inter-breeding, depending on their 'biochemistries'), which could then be pathogenic and have unanticipated stark effects. Surely, as one surveys the history of terrestrial catastrophic epidemics and pandemics, most were unanticipated and should be lessons not to under-rate the aggressiveness of many life-forms. Thus, in summary, pathogenicity to any terrestrial life could result from Martian organisms, terrestrial organisms that were conveyed to Mars, and pathogenicity could result in the Martian and terrestrial contexts, including new organisms that interbred. In the obverse, terrestrial life could be inimical to Martian life. This applies to all such exoplanetary explorations.",

Human Ebola virus infections were also detected in Lagos, Ghana, and Sierra Leone. Fruit bats are the reservoir for Ebola virus. Virus infected bats have been found in the DRC, Gabon, Lagos, Nigeria, and Ghana. Moreover, satellite telemetry is used to track bat migrations. Direct exposure to fruit bats can result in Ebola virus infection.",
