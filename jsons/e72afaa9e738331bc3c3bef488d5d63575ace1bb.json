A four-point Likert-type scale, comprising 1 (never or very rare), 2 (sometimes), 3 (often) and 4 (very often or always), was used to grade their response. A high score corresponds to a high anxiety level. The students' perceived sources of stress from the SARS outbreak were measured with a 20-item scale that described various situations encountered during the SARS outbreak. A six-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (no) to 6 (severe) was used to grade their response. Demographic data included gender, age, university, faculty, and year of study. Since the outbreak was an unprecedented public health emergency, the items were constructed based on interviews of SARS patients and health care workers at PWH as well as reference to the Life Experience Survey (Sarason, Johnson, & Siegel, 1978) . The questionnaire was reviewed by a panel (comprising an epidemiologist, a public health doctor, a behavioural scientist and a psychologist).",

This approach has several advantages-in particular, high efficiency and low cost (Best & Krueger, 2002) . Coverage error, a wellrecognized problem of e-mail surveys is of less concern because a comprehensive list of e-mail addresses was available for students in each university, which was used to contact students. The major limitations of the survey are the low response rates and the lack of information of the non-respondents. Selection bias can be substantial. Yet, systematic differences between respondents and non-respondents cannot be accurately ascertained. This severely limited the interpretation of the study results. In this survey, three groups of university students with similar socioeconomic status were studied. It is reasonable to assume that respondents were more concerned about the SARS outbreak than non-respondents (and therefore took the trouble to respond to the survey). Their anxiety scores could therefore be higher than those of the non-respondents. However, it seems unlikely that the direction of this bias would differ between the groups. Hence, between-group comparisons are still valid.",

The mean score of the medical students was just above the limit of the normal range 20-34 (Fruehwald, Loeffler-Stastka, Eher, Saletu, & Baumhackl, 2001) , while those of the other two groups were slightly lower. Assuming that the observations were unbiased, one possible explanation for the observed differences between the three groups could be the distance of the respondents from the epicentre of the SARS outbreak. The outbreak of SARS started in the PWH, where most medical students lived. It is located about 7 km from the CUHK main campus (where most non-medical students resided), while the HKUST is about 20 km away. Since a large number of medical students contracted SARS during the outbreak (Wong et al., 2004b) , this group might have perceived a higher risk of contracting SARS. This hypothesis agrees with findings by Chen, Chung, Chen, Fang, and Chen (2003) . Besides the geographical proximity of the CUHK campus to the hospital, the higher scores found among nonmedical CUHK students (as compared to HKUST students, who share similar backgrounds) could also be explained by social interactions between the medical and non-medical students in the CUHK campus or residential halls. The three groups were also quite different in how they felt towards the disease. Among the questions with significant differences in their scores, those pertaining to the facts and characteristics of the disease, such as the diagnosis, treatment and complications of SARS, and the risk of being infected, had significantly lower scores among the medical students. This suggests that knowledge of the disease might reduce one's fear and anxiety, while inadequate understanding of SARS and its control measures might have accounted for the anxiety of visiting a hospital, as exemplified by higher scores among the non-medical CUHK and HKUST students. In contrast, the higher scores seen among medical students for questions relating to the spread of the disease and its control might have reflected a genuine worry about the immense difficulties faced by the health workers in controlling SARS. Likewise, medical students also scored higher in questions relating to the perceived risk to health care workers, and their feeling of being ostracized by the community. It should be noted however, that the between-group differences were small and of uncertain clinical significance.",

(2004a) conducted a similar study, which showed a lower perceived stress score in health care students compared to non-health care students. This was different from the results of this study and was attributed to a 'fear of the unknown'. Wong's study (Wong et al., 2004a) was targeted at a smaller number of medical and nursing students attending infection control training and an unspecified, much smaller group of non-health care students. Although the response rate among the health care students was high, the corresponding rate for the non-health care students was not provided. Nor was the sampling method in this group described. In contrast to this study, their medical and nursing students were from another teaching hospital that did not have any SARS cases (SARS expert committee, 2003) . It was the only public hospital spared of the SARS outbreak and was situated some 15 km away from the nearest hospital with SARS in the same region. By contrast, a higher stress level among the CUHK medical students during the outbreak could be related to the geographical proximity.",
