The reconstruction of Western Europe was due in large part to the 1948 Marshall plan in which the United States provided over $12 billion (nearly $100 billion in 2016 US dollars) in economic assistance over a four-year period. The motivations were mixed, of course: partly humanitarian in order to provide relief to people lacking food, shelter, and basic services, but also to promote prosperity, democracy, and stability in Europe and therefore create both a bulwark against Communism and future customers of US exports. The massive reconstruction effort, in which my maternal grandfather was involved, served as an inspiration for a growing system of grants and lowinterest loans provided by the United States and later Europe to poor, newly independent countries in Africa and Asia.",

The scene reminded me of Outbreak, a film released in 1995 starring many Hollywood icons, including Dustin Hoffman, Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman. The film was about the public panic and response by military and civilian agencies in the wake of a fictional outbreak of an Ebola-like virus in Zaire, and later in a small town in California. A reallife outbreak of the Ebola virus was ongoing in Zaire when the film was released. The film contained exaggerations to enhance its shock value but wasn't too far from fact.",

Transmission of the virus often occurs through caregivers such as family members or medical personnel in homes or healthcare environments where infection-control practices are weak.

Fortunately, it is not transmitted through the air, like influenza or tuberculosis, or transmitted before symptoms appear, like measles or HIV. Nonetheless, it can result in terrible consequences for its victims and can spread quickly if not brought under control. In its early phase, victims of Ebola can be misdiagnosed because it is relatively rare and because some of the symptoms, including fever, fatigue, muscle pain, and headache, are difficult to distinguish from those of other infectious diseases, such as malaria and typhoid fever. Victims often subsequently experience vomiting, diarrhea, rashes, and hemorrhages resulting in internal and/or external bleeding. The dysfunction or collapse of multiple body organs leads to severe injury and often death. The fatality rate varies from 25 to 90%, depending on the strain.",

The control of other devastating viruses, such as malaria, and even the provision of routine medical services declined.

The aid contributed to the faster deployment of doctors and nurses and the purchase of diagnostic equipment and medical supplies. Disaster Assistance Response Teams of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and teams from the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC) were deployed to the region to carry out an assessment of what needed to be done. The US airlifted significant amounts of personal protective gear, generators, and medical equipment. By early summer, it seemed that wiring funds and providing assistance from a distance would be enough as the number of reported cases leveled off and then dropped, suggesting the outbreak could be contained as in the 23 previously reported outbreaks in Africa since 1976. Instead, the virus spread. By late July it reached, for the first time in history, densely populated metropolitan areas, not only in the three countries of origin but further afield. A traveler with Ebola had flown from Monrovia, Liberia, to Lagos, Nigeria, Africa's most populous city (with 21 million inhabitants) where he had contact with multiple people who later contracted the illness. A massive effort by the Nigerian government, assisted by the CDC, managed to contain the outbreak to just 19 cases in two cities. By early August, the World Health Organization categorized the outbreak as a \"public health emergency of international concern,\" a declaration that caught media headlines and unlocked significant new funding. Claus Sorensen, an old friend and the director-general of European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO), conceded that in an Ebola crisis \"speed is of the essence, and there is a feeling that all of us have been behind the curve.\" 2 The decisive factor in galvanizing action in the EU and the US was a series of shocking announcements regarding the Ebola infections outside Africa. In late July and early August, two US citizens, including a doctor with Samaritan's Purse, were repatriated to Atlanta, where they (successfully) underwent treatment for Ebola in a specialized isolation ward in Emory University Hospital. They were the first two patients ever to receive such treatment in the United States. In early October, two Spanish priests died in Madrid after contracting the virus in Sierra Leone; a nurse who had treated them also tested positive (but later recovered), the first person to have been infected outside of West Africa. Shortly thereafter a Liberian national who had recently returned from Liberia to the United States died of Ebola in a Dallas hospital. The nurses who had cared for him contracted the virus but recovered.",

It criticized federal, state, and local unpreparedness to cope with the threat of an epidemic and the government's focus on the political implications of public reactions rather than on the underlying health concerns. 3 By the end of the year, the US government's response started shifting decisively toward attacking Ebola at its source. President Obama was clear about the stakes: this is an epidemic that is not just a threat to regional security -it's a potential threat to global security if these countries break down, if their economies break down, if people panic.

The United States was to airlift more than 400 metric tons of personal protective equipment and other medical and relief supplies during the subsequent months.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, headquartered in Sweden, coordinates the work of health experts in different countries but does not have its own emergency-response teams. Similarly, EU member states, rather than the European Commission, dispose of their own medical personnel, hospitals, labs, and stock of specialized equipment. But as the only European body with a global picture of the fast-moving epidemic, the European Commission successfully played the role of \"traffic cop\" to ensure that Europe's response was consistent and effective. That role included the identification of the type and destination of emergency supplies for West Africa, providing a clearinghouse of information about the crisis and the disease, and the creation of a list of available member state assets relevant for the treatment of Ebola in Europe.",

By the end of 2018, Power Africa had attracted over $54 billion in commitments and had catalyzed about $18 billion in investment into 120 power projects and over 10 gigawatts of capacity. These projects connected about 12 million homes and 53 million people. Most of these connections are from solar lanterns that power a single light and enable the charging of a mobile phone. As basic as that may sound, even such connections can result in dramatic improvements in livelihood. Power Africa is moving beyond these connections to include larger, more on-grid power projects using non-renewable sources.",

Improved access to HIV treatment has cut the number of AIDS-related deaths in half since the peak in 2005, from 1.8 million to under 1 million in 2017. However, HIV infections remain very high and especially among adolescent girls and young women who are up to eight times more likely to be HIV positive than young men in some African countries. On the current trajectory, the Global Fund is unlikely to meet its goal of reducing new infections to 500,000 globally by 2020.

It remains the leading cause of death from infectious disease, with 1.3 million deaths per year, not including HIV co-infections. Deaths from drug-resistant TB are responsible for about one-third of all deaths due to antimicrobial resistance worldwide; if trends continue, 2.6 million people will die of drug-resistant TB by 2050, costing the global economy trillions of dollars in lost output.",

It will be more challenging, but important, for the US and EU to reconsider some of their policies that undermine their joint objectives to promote more stable economic and political conditions in the poorest countries. In the case of the US, that means its practice of tying aid to the purchase of US agricultural commodities. In the case of the EU, that means its practice of dumping into African markets the cheap surplus food that results from generous European production subsidies; and it also means its opposition to genetically modified food and feed that prevents African countries from accepting some food aid and planting more resilient crops. 19 ",
