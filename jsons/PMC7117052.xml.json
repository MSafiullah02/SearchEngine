Tests were conducted in a nitrogen atmosphere to prevent production of ozone (O3), which is one of the common reactive species generated by an electrical corona in air. After 30 min of exposure to negative and positive ions, the reductions of E. coli bacteria were approximately 91% and 98%, respectively [4], and after 60 min of exposure, the reductions of P. veronii bacteria were approximately 95% and 86%, respectively [5]. Further, it was suggested that cell death could be due to a change in the outer membrane as a result of ionic interactions.",

[13], nonthermal plasma generated by a wire-to-plate type DBD reactor was applied to inactivate aerosolized B. subtilis cells and Pseudomonas fluorescence as well as indoor and outdoor bioaerosols. Less than 2% of B. subtilis aerosols survived a plasma treatment of 0.12 s, while none of the P. fluorescens aerosols survived. Exposure of environmental bacterial aerosols to the plasma for 0.06 s also resulted in significant inactivation of more than 95% for bacteria. Gallagher et al. [14] demonstrated a 97% reduction in culturable E. coli with a millisecond exposure time in a dielectric barrier grating discharge (DBGD) plasma (one pass through discharge), and a subsequent 99.95% reduction 2 min following treatment. The direct plasma exposure time of 0.73 ms (per pass) allows enough time for bacteria to be attacked by all chemically active components of plasma (charged particles, OH radicals, atomic oxygen, and ozone), which is one explanation for the initial 97% reduction in culturability. Remote exposure to the remaining ozone in the subsequent 2 min direct plasma treatment may account for the additional 99.95% reduction. Vaze et al. [15] suggested that in their DBGD experiment, the main cause of inactivation is the synergetic action of short-lived plasma agents (charges, radicals) and ozone. This synergy creates a toxic environment for the bacteria, ultimately resulting in inactivation.",

Some of the bioaerosols are charged by ions generated from the DBD and are deposited (or collected) on electrode surfaces along the electric field. The collection efficiency was reported to increase with the applied voltage and the flow residence time. In this study, we measured the concentration of bioaerosols at the outlet of the DBD reactor both with and without applied power to determine its collection efficiency, which was not reported in the studies of Liang et al. [13], Gallagher et al. [14], and Vaze et al. [15]. The collection efficiency of a DBD reactor is an important factor in determining the performance of DBD reactors. Since a relatively large amount of bioaerosols can be collected in the DBD reactor and only a small portion of the bioaerosols can exit the reactor under high applied voltage and long flow residence time conditions, simply defining the inactivation efficiency with colony counting numbers for DBD as \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d may lead to an overestimation of inactivation efficiency of a DBD reactor. In this study, we introduce a methodology to deduce the inactivation efficiency of a DBD reactor using both aerosol- and colony-counting methods.",

Fig. 5\nshows the results for various applied voltages. The NO2 and O3 concentrations were 60.6\u201374.7 and 25.8\u201338.1 ppm, respectively. Higher applied voltages led to higher concentrations of NO2 and O3 because it became statistically more likely that N2 and O2 would be attacked by electrons. According to Pek\u00e1rek [34], the initial steps in the formation of NO2 and O3 are the dissociation of N2 and O2 by electrons. The number of generated electrons is proportional to the applied current, which is also proportional to the applied voltage. Therefore, NO2 and O3 concentrations are proportional to the applied voltage. In this study, NO was observed using a spectrometer, however it was not detected by the gas analyzer (the detection limit for NO concentration is about 1 ppm). The spectrometer detects light emitted by NO molecules during their transition from an excited state to a lower energy state, while the final products of molecules from chemical kinetics are measured downstream by the gas analyzer. Hackam and Akiyama [35], Ruan et al. [36], and Wang et al. [37] presented that NO produced by plasma can be removed via the following reactions:(4)O + NO + M \u2192 NO2 + M\n(5)N + NO \u2192 N2 + Owhere M is a third body, which can be N2 or O2. Therefore, from our results obtained using the spectrometer and the gas analyzer, we expect that NO produced by plasma was changed to NO2 or N2 before entering the gas analyzer.",

To calculate Eq. (6), we assumed that the mobilities (\u03bcion) were 1.1 and 1.9 cm2/V s for positive and negative air ions, respectively [38]. We inserted the maximum absolute current values (Imax) as I in Eq. (6) for obtaining the maximum air ion concentrations. The maximum concentrations of positive and negative air ions for 7.5 kV were 4.09 \u00d7 1011 and 2.08 \u00d7 1011\n ions/cm3, respectively. The reason that the concentration of positive air ions was higher than that of negative air ions is the higher mobility of positive air ions. Our results were similar to those of Byeon et al. [39]. When the units of concentration were converted to ppm, the range of the maximum air ion concentration was 0.0083\u20130.0164 ppm, which was approximately 1/3100\u20131/2300 the value of the ozone concentration (25.8\u201338.1 ppm). However, according to Vaze et al. [15], the bacterial inactivation efficiency is not high if only ozone exists without other reactive species. They reported that the reduction of E. coli bioaerosols exposed to DBD was 97% for 10 s of exposure time, but the reduction of E. coli bioaerosols exposed to ozone (concentration: 28 ppm; exposure time: 10 s) was only 10%.",

Because the amplitude of oscillation of bioaerosols in a DBD reactor and the particle charging increased as the applied voltage increased, a higher applied voltage led to higher collection efficiencies. With a particle mobility, b\np, electric field strength, E, and excitation frequency, \u03c9, the maximum particle displacement, l\nmax, is (2b\np\nE)/\u03c9\n[40] and the electric field strength, E, is proportional to the applied voltage. Longer residence times and higher applied voltages increased the chance of bioaerosols being attacked by ions, ozone, or atomic oxygen, which resulted in higher inactivation efficiencies. Efficiencies \u03b7CFU, \u03b7Number, and \u03b7Inactivation of up to 94%, 64%, and 83%, respectively, were obtained for an applied voltage of 7.5 kV and a residence time of 0.24 s. Liang et al.

[14], the efficiencies based on the number of CFUs for removing B. subtilis bioaerosols and E. coli bioaerosols were 98 and 97% under 115.2 and 102.84 J/L, respectively. If these efficiencies are converted to susceptibility constants suggested in this paper, the susceptibility constants become 0.0340 and 0.0341 L/J, respectively, for Liang et al. [13] and Gallagher et al. [14], which are four-fold higher than the CFU-based susceptibility constant of our DBD reactor, 0.0078 L/J. Therefore, it should be noted that the susceptibility constants introduced so far cannot be directly used for comparing the performance of DBD reactors whose dimensions are different from each other. The removal efficiency increases as plasma treatment time increases, and plasma treatment time increases with the volume of the plasma reactor. For example, the volumes of the reactor used in Liang et al. [13] and Gallagher et al. [14] were 0.026 and 0.025 L, respectively, while our reactor volume was 0.008 L. Therefore, if the same flow rate were used, the removal efficiency using a larger DBD reactor will be higher than that of a smaller DBD reactor, resulting in a higher susceptibility constant for the bigger DBD reactor. For comparing the performance of DBD reactors of different sizes, the modified susceptibility constant is introduced as follows:(13)Z\u2032=Zvolume of plasma reactor(J\u22121)Using Eq. (13), Z\u2032 of our DBD reactor was 0.9763 J\u22121, which is similar to 1.3061 J\u22121 for Liang et al. [13] and 1.3639 J\u22121 for Gallagher et al. [14]. So far, the modified susceptibility constant has been successfully demonstrated for performance evaluation of DBD reactors of different sizes under different DBD operating conditions. Our methodology will be used for design optimization, performance evaluation, and prediction of power consumption of DBD systems for industrial applications.",
