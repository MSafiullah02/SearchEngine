Over the past 25 years, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Trade Organization (WTO) have increasingly dominated policymaking in developing countries, leading to substantial effects on health.1 Furthermore, global threats to health, such as HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian influenza, and climate change, need effective collective action at the international level.2 Therefore the system of global governance is of central, and growing, importance to health.",

However, criticism of the UN's democratic processes has been more limited, and has focused mainly on the selection processes for agency heads, notably those of WHO.5, 6\n",

These researchers reported that countries receive about 59% more US aid and about 8% more UN aid during the time that they are on the UN Security Council than at other times. These figures increase to 170% and 53%, respectively, when important issues are at stake. Overall, US$17 million in aid is diverted in a typical year, and $53 million in an important year, for each of seven or eight countries. Aid is at normal levels in the years immediately before and after UN Security Council membership. The additional UN aid is almost entirely attributable to UNICEF, an agency with close links to the US administration and which is (by another consistently observed tradition) headed by a US citizen (currently, former US Agriculture Secretary, Ann Veneman). Kuziemko and Werker's conclusion that these findings are evidence of an attempt by the USA to buy votes on the UN Security Council seems compelling. However, they have not analysed votes to assess how effective such efforts are, citing problems in the methods for trying to doing so, and they have not assessed how the flow of aid from other donors is affected.",

There is little reason to expect a different outcome at the global level.
