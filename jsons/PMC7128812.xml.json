Throw away the used tissue.\u2022Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth if your hands aren't clean.\u2022Avoid sharing dishes, glasses, bedding and other household items if you're sick.\u2022Clean and disinfect surfaces you often touch on a daily basis.\u2022Stay home from work, school and public areas if you're sick, unless you're going to get medical care.
