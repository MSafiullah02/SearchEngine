These are the reasons why we used the slope value calculated from the earlier data. As a matter of fact, however, the slope value remained almost constant during 2 weeks (-0.234 to -0.234) despite the increase of the y-intercept from 0.810 to 0.833 (corresponding to 5% increase of IR), which indicates the reliability of our analysis.",

The fact that several tens of times of identified cases are already infected, often asymptomatic, may urge reconsideration of the strategy in the management of COVID-19. Finding out all infected persons and completely containing the infection is unrealistic since ER is less than 3% in most major countries. Other than complete containment, herd immunity, and effective treatment/vaccines, attenuation of the viral virulence is another way to make the pandemic less damaging (8) . This is achieved in animals by natural selection (9) but in humans the prevention of in-hospital infection, especially from severe cases, would be the key. This might be a choice, especially in countries with already low estimated IFR, mainly Asian countries such as Singapore, India, Indonesia or Japan (Table 1) .",
