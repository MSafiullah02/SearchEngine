Although this trend might be biased by high incidence of nosocomial infections among adult medical workers, it would seem that community-based infection is not resulting in great mortality of infants; an unusual feature for a severe acute viral illness.",

Furthermore, I believe that regional variations in exposure to non-SARS coronavirus could contribute to what seem to be differences in mortality, notably the apparently high mortality in Canada despite access to the full resource of a developed nation's medical system. The risk of being a supershedder might also be affected by the absence of previous exposure to other coronaviruses.",
