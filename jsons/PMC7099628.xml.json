Data acquisition and quantification were performed using HystarTM and DataAnalysisTM (Bruker, Bremen, Germany). The compounds were analyzed on a Phenomenex Gemini\u00ae 5 \u00b5m C18 (150 mm \u00d7 2 mm) column and protected by a precolumn Security guard Gemini C18 (4 mm \u00d7 2 mm) (Phenomenex, Torrance, USA). The mobile phases were (A) acetonitrile:ammonium formiate (20 mM with 1 vol-% formic acid) (5:95 v/v) and (B) acetonitrile:ammonium formiate (10 mM with 1 vol-% formic acid) (80:20 v/v). Analytes extracted from the M-M SPE column were analyzed with this gradient mobile phase: initial conditions of A:B (93:7 v/v), with linear gradient up to A:B (10:90 v/v) over 7 min, held for 3 min then back to initial conditions in 1 min and then equilibrate for 4 min before next injection (total run time 15 min).

Flow rate were 0.3 ml/min and injection volume 10 \u00b5l. The analytes were detected using an Esquire 4000 ion-trap mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI interface running in positive mode (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). MS parameters were as follows: mass scan range m/z 200\u2013800, nebulizer flow 40 psi (nitrogen), dry gas flow 9.0 l/min (nitrogen), dry temperature 365\u00b0C, ion spray voltage 5000 V and skimmer offset 38 V.

Concentrations were determined using a nonweighted linear calibration curve analyzed at each run and within- and between-run precisions were calculated.

This decrease has previously been prevented by pretreating the paper with 0.75 M tartaric acid [10], but this treatment has never been tested for the other drugs (e.g., for stability and recovery).

A simple extraction step using pure acetonitrile or methanol with either direct injection or injection after evaporation/dissolution would be preferable. Extraction and direct injection was not possible since the paper itself absorbed approximately 200 to 300 \u00b5l of solvent. Approximately 400 \u00b5l of solvent would be required to enable direct injection, which resulted in too much dilution. An additional problem was severe band broadening for the early eluting hydrophilic drugs resulting in very broad and distorted peaks. An alternative was to evaporate the solvent and reconstitute it in an appropriate solvent for LC. However, this approach led to very low recovery for the lipophilic LF probably due to irreversible absorption to blood residues (i.e., proteins) during the evaporation step. Several of the drugs also showed low recovery due to the high (100%) organic content. The recovery could be increased if water was added to lower the amount of organic solvent, but this resulted in a more efficient extraction of endogenous blood components and increased interferences in the chromatogram.",

The M-M SPE column could extract all drugs but also had some major drawbacks. The M-M column did not manage to purify the samples enough. Blood residues would adsorb some of the LF during the evaporation step giving random recoveries between 0 and 20%. LF also needed approximately 20\u201325% organic solvent in the load step to prevent precipitation, but this resulted in huge breakthrough on the SPE column for SDX with less than 2% recovery.

The aim was to extract all water-soluble drugs, leaving LF (and potentially other lipohilic drugs that could be of interest later) on the paper for a second extraction. This would hopefully improve extraction recoveries and produce cleaner extracts. All drugs except LF were optimized on the M-M column. Extraction with 20% methanol was the best choice, which also prevented LF from being co-extracted from the spots. Before loading the sample onto the SPE column it had to be diluted to 10% methanol to avoid breakthrough of SDX and elution was accomplished using methanol:triethylamine 97:3. Another advantage with separating LF from the others was that the reconstitution solvent for the other drugs could be limited to only 10% methanol, thereby avoiding band broadening when injected into the LC system. LF was then extracted from the blood spot using a combination of acetonitrile:acetic acid 0.5 M 50:50 [10] and applied onto a C8 disc SPE column.

This means that it is possible to later go back into the data set and look for other drugs that might be in the samples. The main disadvantage of the ion-trap for quantitative measurements is that the linear range is somewhat smaller than for a quadrupole instrument. Three internal standards were added during the first validation series, one with properties suitable for the highly hydrophilic drugs (i.e., CQm, CQ and Q), one internal standard suitable for SDX and one with lipophilic properties for LF. After evaluation of validation data it was concluded that internal standards had no major effect in correcting deviations in the method. To enable the assay the possibility to also capture other drugs, the internal standards were omitted (i.e., the chromatograms would get less crowded).

Although LF is not soluble in water, very small amounts will probably solvate and this would affect the accuracy of the lowest concentrations the most.

An overlay of the drugs in this assay is shown in Figure 2, extracted from a blood spot (250 ng/ml) with M-M column. Figure 3 shows the corresponding LF extraction with a C8 disc column. Matrix effects were evaluated by comparing the peaks from extracted blank samples spiked with reference sample (spiked reconstitution solvent) and compared with the same pure reference solution at two different concentrations. No major matrix effects were observed form the six different donors and any variations were within that of the method itself. Post-column infusion was also performed. There were no visible matrix effects for any of the drugs from any of the blank extracts from the six blood donors.",

With detection limits of 50 ng/ml and a relatively long half-life for most of the drugs in this assay, it is possible to detect drugs up to a few weeks after drug intake. The use of ion-trap MS with an ESI interface and total ion chromatograms make it possible to extract and identify other common antimalarials and other drugs that might be of interest at a later stage. A very simple extraction method would be optimal but with the huge differences in physicochemical properties it was not possible to achieve this. LF with a detection limit of 200 ng/ml is detectible approximately 1 week after drug treatment and at that drug level it is possible to use LC with UV detection with approximately the same detection limit. However, the possibility to later go back to extract and identify m/z of an unidentified peak as in ion-trap LC\u2013MS is not possible. In the future, it would be desirable to develop a faster and simpler sample preparation technique if possible. Preferably a fast and easy extraction such as extracting the blood spot with solvent, adding internal standard then mixing, centrifuging and carrying out direct analysis with HPLC\u2013MS/MS. The possibility of using direct desorption techniques for DBS is interesting [22\u201325], but these techniques will likely be vulnerable to matrix effects due to the lack of proper sample clean-up. Future development of better extraction techniques, more efficient separations and more sensitive mass spectrometers will hopefully pave the way for sensitive high-throughput screening methods.",
