To estimate the error in making such distance measurements from the 2-dimensional (2-D) screen images that were enlarged and printed to perform this measurement, the Laerdal trainer was again set up with the 3 types of oxygen masks, with wooden rods. The rods were actually tapered chopsticks, and the pointed ends conveniently allowed their secure insertion into the particularly small exit holes of the simple and nonrebreathing masks. These rods were of known lengths and were positioned to represent approximately the directions of the chin-to-chest (x1) and exhaled smoke plume (y1) measurements for each mask. These smoke plumes were emitted in a roughly conically shaped space, with the cone apex adjacent to the oxygen mask, and the rod in the y1 direction was positioned to lie within this space, accordingly. The Laerdal trainer with the mask and attached rods was carefully positioned to be as similar as possible to that of the corresponding captured digital image for the same mask with its exhaled smoke plumes then photographed at a resolution of 1024 \u00d7 768 pixels with a digital camera (Canon Ixus II, Canon Inc., Tokyo, Japan).",

The distances x1 and y1 were measured from enlarged, printed still images taken from the digital film footage for each mask, at each setting (as shown in Fig 1A). Knowing the real length of the rods (real lengths x2 and y2 in Fig 1B), the 2 ratios x1/x2 and y1/y2 were compared. If these distances had been measured in the same plane and the same direction on the same screen image, then these 2 ratios should be equal. Any difference between the ratios x1/x2 and y1/y2 would be due to geometric distortion and give an estimate of the error incurred by measuring and scaling up distances measured from the enlarged, printed, 2-D still images of the exhaled smoke plumes. Therefore, scaled up, real value of y1 could be estimated as the following:",

Although the relatively higher oxygen flow rates of 10 L/min and 15 L/min used for the simple oxygen mask were not used for the nonrebreathing and the Venturi-type masks, from the results shown in Table 2, it is not unreasonable to assume that the maximum visible dispersal distances (and hence the minimum distances traveled) of the exhaled smoke plume for these latter 2 masks would almost certainly exceed those of the simple oxygen mask at these higher oxygen flow rates.

From these latter 2 studies, the estimated dispersal distances of exhaled, potentially infectious, air from patients using such respiratory assist devices were in the range of 0.40 to 0.50 m. These studies used a more sophisticated lighting system with monochromatic, coherent laser light-sheet. They also tested a more limited range or a totally different respiratory assistance setup, ie, a simple oxygen mask at 1 respiratory setting (RR = 12 breaths/min; TV = 0.5 L; oxygen flow rate = 4 L/min),18 and noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation.19 This present study also differs from those of Hui et al18, 19 in that it was performed in a more typical isolation room environment, with ambient lighting and a background ventilation rate of 12 air changes per hour. The exact effect of the 12 air changes per hour on the extent of the smoke plumes is difficult to quantify, although their dispersal patterns as shown here may be more representative of those seen in isolation rooms commonly used for patients suspected to be infected with respiratory pathogens of higher morbidity/mortality.",

The visible boundaries of exhaled flows can only be a guide to the real behavior of infectious droplets in exhaled air. Although Hui et al18, 19 suggested upper limits of exhaled-plume distances as possible safety zones, some of the more distantly dispersed particles may not be visible in their image capture systems. Somogyi et al17 presented their results in a slightly different manner by stating that the visible cloud (or smoke), in fact, indicates the minimum distance traveled by the exhaled air, which may be a more cautious approach that can be used to interpret the results presented in this study. Hence, from this study, those of Hui et al,18, 19 and to a lesser extent that of Somoygi et al,17 there is a suggestion of a minimum baseline \u201cnosocomial hazard zone\u201d extending to at least 0.4 m away from patients using such respiratory support devices. It is likely to extend farther than this, but this could not be quantified from this study. Such a \u201cnosocomial hazard zone\u201d may well increase in size when the patient coughs or sneezes. This could not be examined using the same respiratory model used in this study (there is no cough function) but is certainly worthy of further investigation using other models, eg, perhaps using human volunteers.",

It still concludes, however, that influenza is mostly transmitted by large droplets and direct contact.15 Tellier16 goes one step further and presents a convincing argument as to why influenza should be considered as a true airborne infection and recommends N95 respirators as the minimum level of personal protective equipment for the purposes of pandemic influenza planning.",

However, when a new respiratory pathogen arises, with the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality, eg, SARS and more recently avian H5N1 or possibly some other future pandemic influenza strain, this baseline data should be useful in reducing nosocomial transmission and enhancing health care workers' awareness of the risks posed by the use of such respiratory assist devices. In addition, it is known that, unlike SARS-associated coronavirus, influenza may be presymptomatically transmissible.36, 37 Hence, there is a convincing argument for all staff working in the immediate vicinity, ie, within a zone of 0.4 m, of such patients, to be wearing N95 masks as their minimum personal protective equipment during an influenza pandemic or when dealing with any other respiratory pathogen with the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.",

This distance had to be estimated, taking into account the geometric distortion due to the different relative positions of the Laerdal trainer, the digital camera, and the direction traveled by the exhaled smoke plume. It was estimated by knowing the real value of the chin-to-chest distance (x2 in B) on the Laerdal trainer, the measured screen distances of x1 and y1 (in A), and the relative error of these measured screen distances, estimated by the ratio (x1/x2)/(y1/y2), where the real lengths of the wooden rods, x2 and y2, were known. Note that these ratios x1/x2 and y1/y2 will not be exactly the same because they are measured in different directions and different planes, so they will be at different distances from the camera. It is this difference between ratios x1/x2 and y1/y2 that gives the value of the geometric corrections shown in Table 2.",
