An audit of ARV prescribing was performed before and after this policy change and the results compared to evaluate ARV management and patient outcomes at the centre throughout this period of change. Other relevant changes also occurred during this time as newer ARVs became available and commissioned by NHS England. Methods: Retrospective case record review of patients starting ARVs for the first time in our centre before (Jan 2011-April 2014) and after (April 2015-16) the PA was introduced. We assessed whether treatment was consistent with BHIVA guidelines and the PA, those with undetectable HIV viral loads (VLs) and still on first line treatment (persistency) after starting ARVs and the cost savings achieved. In the first audit differences in prescribing patterns between consultants was also assessed, following the introduction of the PA this was no longer considered necessary and all prescribing members of the multidisciplinary team (MDT) were included. Results: Records from 180 patients were examined; 110 in the first and 70 in the second audit. Compliance with BHIVA guidelines was high; 92% and 97%. In the first audit there were only minor differences in consultant's prescribing practices. Following introduction of the PA only 6% were on the first line regimen (Kivexa/Efavirenz) and 76% on other PA regimens with justification for 81% and documented MDT in 63%. Those with an undetectable VL 6 months into treatment increased from 49% to 94% but persistency rates were similar. The largest changes in prescribing are the increase in use of lamivudine/abacavir; from 6% to 64% and integrase inhibitors (INI) from 10% to 84%; the single most commonly prescribed regimen was Atripla (32%) in the first audit and Triumeq (54%) in the second. Cost savings were of approximately \u00a3500 per patient per year. Conclusion: Significant changes in prescribing practice have been noted at our unit in the past 5 years with improvements in rapid virological control noted. As so few patients are on first line regimen of the new PA this is unlikely to be the reason; it is more likely the increase in use of INI, especially Triumeq. The cost savings from the PA introduction are modest and should be weighed against the increased need for MDT discussion for even straightforward prescribing decisions.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Background: While ATV-related nephrolithiasis is well reported, with an approximate incidence of 23.7 cases per 1000 patient years, Atazanavir (ATV)related cholelithiasis is only recently described. We report the case of a 47 year old white-British male, presenting with cholangitis due to an ATV containing gallstone. Methods: Following diagnosis in 1992, our patient started antiretroviral therapy in 1999. At presentation he had been on Truvada. ATV-Ritonavir for 6 years. His admission CD4 count was 443 cells/mm 3 (39%) with a non-detectable viral load (<20 copies/ml). The patient presented with right upper quadrant pain, fevers and jaundice and treated for biliary sepsis. Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatogram (MRCP) confirmed gallstones and possible sludge in the distal common bile duct with duct dilatation. At Endoscopic Retrograde Pancreatogram (ERCP, despite sphincterotomy, the 5-8 mm common bile duct stone could not be removed and two 9-12 mm balloons burst on contact with the stone. After a third balloon impacted the stone, attempted stent insertion failed. At a second ERCP three days later the stone was successfully removed with a dormia basket. As a consequence of concerns regarding ATV gallstones, his medication was changed to Truvada, Darunavir-Ritonavir. Results: The stone was sent for ATV drug level analysis using a validated HPLC-MS methodology. Macroscopically it was a single brown stone. It was dissolved in 4.5 mls of 0.9% normal saline before it could be weighed, based on size and estimated specific gravity, we estimate a weight range of 130-540 mg. Stone ATV concentrations were estimated at 125-520 lg/mg. In comparison, typical concentrations of ATV (300/100 mg formulation) in nonpregnant HIV+ patients at steady-state are reported as a geometric Cmin of 700-1500 ng/mL, and Cmax of 4000-5500 ng/mL. Conclusions: Our case represents the first measurement of ATV stone concentration in a patient presenting with gallstones while still on long-term ATV, and suggests much higher stone concentrations of ATV than previously reported. From the gastroscopist's point of view, we would highlight the unusual feature that several balloons burst easily on contact with the stone. As patients remain on ATV for longer periods, vigilance for ATV associated cholelithiasis should be maintained, even after stopping the drug. ERCP operatives may find ATV containing bile duct stones better removed with Dormia baskets rather than balloons.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Clinical outcomes of naive patients started on darunavir/ cobicistat-based ART: experience from a clinical setting F Clark, D Cousins, N Lomax, S Warren and S Attridge Cardiff Royal Infirmary, UK Background: A fixed dose combination pill containing darunavir and cobisistat marketed as Rezolsta \u00e2 was approved for use in Welsh HIV clinics in August 2015. This offers a fixed dose protease inhibitor option and reduction in pill burden for patients. However, patients and providers may be concerned about efficacy, safety, tolerability and impact on measurement of renal function. Methods: Patients started on first line antiretroviral (ARV) therapy containing Rezolsta \u00e2 between June 2015 and November 2016 were identified from pharmacy records. Data was collected on demographics, baseline characteristics, ARV and other drug history. Data was also collected on clinical parameters along with renal function and patient reported side effects. Results: 22 notes were identified as eligible for inclusion. Many patients were male (90%) and the median age was 32 years. Median time between diagnosis and start was 1 month (range 0-188) with a median nadir CD4 count of 280 cells/mm 3 (range 80-550). 2 patients (9%) had documented archived resistance prior to starting. All patients were commenced on a tenofovir containing backbone. An undetectable viral load was achieved by 24 weeks in 90% of patients (median 12 weeks). The median change in estimated GFR at 4 weeks was 0 ml/min. 8 patients (36%) reported side effects which included rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and headaches. However all resolved within 2 weeks and no patients switched/stopped treatment due to side-effects. 17 patients started a Rezolsta \u00e2 based ART prior to resistance test results and once the result was known 2 patients switched therapies to reduce drug interaction and 1 switched for STR choice. 19/22 patients (86%) continued on their initial Rezolsta \u00e2 based ART. Conclusion: The majority of na\u20ac \u0131ve patients using Rezolsta \u00e2 achieved an undetectable viral load within 24 weeks. A switch in 3 patients suggests other regimens with different side effect profiles and pill burdens are an option but 86% continued on their Rezolsta \u00e2 based ART. No patients who started prior to a resistance test result had to be switched due to transmitted drug resistance. The tolerability of the short lived side effects was widely observed. The absence of eGFR change seen in this patient cohort leads clinicians to have a low threshold of concern for monitoring renal function.

Following presentation of phase 3 clinical trial results for tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) based products, Gilead Sciences was approached for early access. Gilead made available 3 products elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtrictabine/ TAF (Genvoya), emtricitabine/TAF (Descovy) & rilpivirine/emtrictabine/TAF (Odefsey) through a compassionate use programme (CUP).

After an audit in 2013 I initiated a quality improvement project to review and improve anti-retroviral regimens for suitable patients. I re-audited my cohort during 2016. Methods: Prospective case note review and database completion on 308 HIV positive patients booked to attend their HIV physician during 2016. During that time 2 patients were lost to follow up, 2 died from non-HIV related causes (with a normal CD4, VL<40 copies/ml on HAART) and 4 transferred care (2 moved out of area, 2 transferred for specialist care). The non-attendance rate for this outpatient clinic was 11%. 68% of this cohort had been diagnosed late, 28% with AIDS defining illnesses (ADI) and 40% with baseline viral loads >100,000 copies/ml. 18% were diagnosed >15 years ago, 31%>10 years, 31%>5 years, 14% <5 years and 6% were newly diagnosed <1 year. Results: 282/300 (94%) were on HAART (82% on Home Delivery). 6 patients have been strongly advised to take HAART for medical reasons but decline (but are still engaged in care), 12 are asymptomatic and not ready to start and 2 are elite controllers VL<40 without HAART. 282/282 (100%) on HAART have a VL<200 copies/ml, 279/282(99%) <100 copies/ml, 272/282(96%) <50 copies/ml and 262/282(93%) <40 copies/ ml. 189/282 (67%) patients were on NNRTI/NRTI (157/282(56%) are on generically available NNRTIs).So far 100% of patients offered switch to generic NNRTI options have done so. 59/282 (21%) are on Protease inhibitors 42/282 (15%) are on Integrase inhibitors 4% patients are on novel HAART due to co-morbidities eg NNRTI,RAL,3TC.

Methods: Treatment na\u20ac \u0131ve, HIV-infected adults were randomized 2:1 to receive blinded treatment once daily with BIC 75 mg or dolutegravir (DTG) 50 mg with open label emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir alafenamide 25 mg (FTC/TAF) for 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion with HIV RNA <50 c/mL at W24 using snapshot analysis. Noninferiority was assessed through 95% CI at W24 and W48. Safety was a secondary endpoint. Results: Of 98 patients enrolled, 65 were randomized to BIC+FTC/TAF and 33 to DTG+FTC/TAF. Most subjects were male, had asymptomatic HIV infection, with median HIV-1 RNA 4.4-4.5 log10.

The main outcome was 48-week viral suppression (VL<50 c/mL). Missing VL data and INI switches were accounted for in 3 ways: (i) those without a 48-week VL measure excluded (M=E; S=I); (ii) those without a VL measure considered to have VL>50 c/mL (M=F; S=I); (iii) those without a VL measure or who switched from INI considered to have VL>50 c/mL (M=F; S=F; NRTI changes ignored). Reasons for discontinuation and emergent resistance were also summarised. Results: 12 centres provided data on 359 patients. 105 (29%) switched to RAL; 218 (61%) to DTG; and 36 (10%) to EVG.

Of those discontinuing initial INI, HIV VL was detectable for 15/57 (26%; 7 switched after 8 weeks) taking RAL, 4/9 (44%; 2 switched after 8 weeks) DTG and 1/2 (50%; 0 switched after 8 weeks) EVG. Genotypes were available for 6/ 15, 2/4 and 0/1 of those who stopped RAL, DTG or EVG respectively with VL>50 c/mL; resistance associated mutations were observed for 2/6 on RAL and 1/2 taking DTG based ART.

The limitations of this study are that it necessarily focuses on patients retained in care, and is limited to note review rather than interviewing patients directly.

Clinicians should ensure they inform patients of benefits and risks of commencing treatment, and document such discussions clearly. When patients transfer care, clinicians should endeavour to provide continuity of care by detailed handover, including the details of such discussions and decisions regarding treatment. Severe psychological or social problems remain an important factor, however the numbers remain small. Background: A small population of cells harbouring an integrated copy of HIV ('the latent reservoir') persist despite effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), and is the barrier to HIV cure. The rarity of these cells and absence of a unique cellsurface marker makes study of this population difficult. Additionally, proviral sequence analysis is complicated by the excess of human genomic material in the reaction. We present a novel HIV DNA capture assay which combined with Next Gen sequencing technology retrieves near full-length HIV sequences as well as integration sites from patient samples. Method: The Agilent SureSelect XT protocol was modified to enrich for HIV proviral DNA. 44,000 unique biotinylated RNA baits homologous to HIV were hybridised to 3 lg CD4 T-cell DNA for 20 hours. Enrichment was achieved by positive selection using streptavidin-coated beads. To improve capture specificity, wash steps were performed at 71\u00b0C. Captured DNA was sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform and the reads mapped de novo to reconstruct the HIV genome. Integration site analysis was performed in two steps. First, reads were mapped to a HIV reference to profile the LTR.

Partner notification (PN) has been shown to be an effective public health strategy and when it is done effectively reduces the cost to diagnose infections. A new tool was developed to support PN delivery and capture patient reported outcomes for STI clinics; however, it had not been tested in an HIV clinic. We therefore introduced the service into an HIV clinic to test its utility to deliver PN and report outcomes. Methods: Analysis was performed following 25 weeks of usage of the PN tool with a focus on the number of index patients, total partners, contactable contacts, the number of partners told and tested either reported by the patient or captured via healthcare worker (HCW) verification using the PN tool. The key performance indicator (KPI) target for STIs has been set as 60 partners seen and tested within four weeks for every 100 index patients (i.e. 0.60), and this was used as a benchmark. Results: PN data was captured for 100 index patients [19 Female all heterosexual (10 Black, 9 White or mixed ethnicity), 58 MSM (49 White or mixed, 5 Asian, 4 Black ethnicity), 16 Heterosexual males (10 Black, 5 White, 1 Asian ethnicity) and nine patients where no demographics were captured] for nine different infections (64 HIV, 21 Syphilis,14 Chlamydia, 11 Gonorrhoea, 5 Hepatitis C, 3 Trichomonas vaginalis, 3 Lymphogranuloma venereum, 1 Hepatitis B, 1 Shigella).

Despite excellent quality of care and high rates of viral suppression in the UK, there remains a fraction of people on antiretroviral therapy (ART) that are not virally suppressed. Heavy alcohol use and recreational drug use are known to influence ART adherence, but their downstream effect on viral non-suppression is unclear. We examine the effect of binge drinking and drug use on viral non-suppression in a nationally weighted sample of people accessing HIV care. Methods: Cross-sectional survey data from the Positive Voices pilot (May-November 2014) were linked to clinical data from the 2014 national HIV cohort of persons accessing care. Odds ratios (ORs) for the associations of binge drinking (\u22658 drinks for men or \u22656 for women on one occasion at least monthly) and drug use (use of recreational drugs in the past year) with viral non-suppression (\u22651 HIV RNA test result \u226550 copies/ml in the past year) were calculated using logistic regression before and after adjusting for self-reported adherence. Analyses were restricted to persons on ART for \u22653 months. Results: Of 611 survey respondents included; 424 (65.7%) were men who have sex with men (MSM), 75 (11.8%) heterosexual men and 112 (17.6%) women. Population-prevalence of binge drinking was 20.9% and drug use 27.8%; with highest prevalence in MSM (33.6% and 54%, respectively). Prevalence of viral non-suppression was 11.6%. Viral non-suppression was higher in binge drinkers compared to non-binge drinkers (15.8% vs 8.9%, p=0.03). After adjusting for drug use, age, HIV risk group and employment status, binge drinkers had double the odds of viral non-suppression compared to non-binge drinkers (aOR=2.22, 95% CI 1.16-4.27, p=0.02). Drug users also had a significantly higher prevalence of viral non-suppression than non-drug users (14.6% vs 8.5%, p=0.015). However after adjustment, no evidence of an association with viral nonsuppression was found (aOR=1.17, 95% CI 0.60-2.28, p=0.64). Adjustment for ART adherence did not change the results. Conclusion: Monthly or more frequent binge drinking is associated with viral non-suppression among those on ART, and this association was not fully explained by the postulated mechanism of ART adherence. Screening for lifestyle behaviours that may impact health including alcohol consumption forms an important part of HIV care. Further research is needed to explore the causal mechanisms. Background: Approximately 1200 pregnancies are reported annually in the United Kingdom (UK) in women diagnosed with HIV. Women living with HIV (WLHIV) may encounter significant psychosocial challenges in their journey to motherhood, even though the UK rate of vertical transmission is currently <0.5%.

Unfortunately, chaotic lifestyles may prevent women from adhering to therapy, increasing risk of vertical transmission. To date, there are few documented cases of successful seronegative multiple pregnancies in poorly compliant HIV-positive women.

She had poorly controlled HIV (CD4 72 cells/ll, VL 272528 copies/ml) but was keen to reengage with services. X resumed her once daily regime of Truvada and boosted Darunavir but had difficulty with treatment adherence and engagement, partly due to confidentiality concerns. With multi-disciplinary team support (including community volunteer input), treatment was intensified to twice daily boosted darunavir with addition of raltegravir, but her viral load remained detectable (above 200 copies/ml). Her pregnancy was complicated by loss of one triplet in the first trimester, one admission with possible spontaneous rupture of membranes (SROM) at 33 weeks, and breech presentation of both twins (although twin B performed spontaneous cephalic version).

Methods: HIV-1 \u00c0 non-pregnant (n=22), pregnant (n=21) and HIV-1 + pregnant women on antiretroviral therapy (ART) (n=11) were recruited, their PBMC isolated, and IFNc and IL-10 ELISpot assays performed. Gag and Nef responses were tested in HIV-1 + individuals only. Flow cytometric analysis of PBMC was undertaken to determine the expression of activation, differentiation and exhaustion markers of dendritic cells (DC), natural killer cells (NK) and T cells. Statistical analysis was carried out using Prism version 7.0. Intergroup variation was assessed by Mann-Whitney tests and statistical significance defined as p = <0.05. Results: There was an increase in HIV-1 + pregnant IFNc response compared to both HIV-1 \u00c0 non-pregnant and pregnant groups against Flu (p=0.0607 and p=0.0148 respectively), and CMV (p=0.0176, p=0.0219). IL-10 response was lower in the HIV-1 \u00c0 pregnant group than non-pregnant against Flu and CMV (p=0.0015, p=0.0440); the HIV-1 + group showed reduced IL-10 responses compared to the pregnant group to both antigens (p=0.0704, p=0.0198). Eighty per cent (8/10) of HIV-1 + women were IFNc responders to Gag, and 70% (7/10) were Nef responders. Phenotypic comparison of pregnant groups showed increased frequency of exhausted (PD-1 + ) CD4 and CD8 T cells in HIV-1 + women (p=0.0048, p=0.0346), reduced anergic NK CD56 \u00c0 CD16 + CD11b + CD27 \u00c0 and CD56 \u00c0 CD16 + NKp30 + NKG2A + populations (p=0.0247, p=0.0064), and raised plasmacytoid DC to myeloid DC 1 and 2 ratio (p=0.0159). Conclusion: Despite ART HIV-1 persists, as shown by Gag and Nef responses. Group differences observed reflect prolonged immune activation and disrupted functional regulation. Furthermore, similar PBMC profiles have been previously associated with HIV-1 \u00c0 pregnancy complications. These findings demonstrate the impact of viral persistence on innate and acquired immunity, implicating HIV-1 as a confounding factor for complications in treated pregnancies, and warranting more in depth functional analysis in this cohort.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P42"}, {"text": "Maternal carriage of Group B streptococcus in HIV-positive women, and subsequent neonatal infection M Watts 1 , A Dempsey 2 , K MacLeod 2 and D Kirkham 3 1 University of Manchester, UK, 2 St Mary's Hospital, Manchester, UK, 3 Manchester Royal Infirmary, UK Background: Group B streptococcus (GBS) is the leading cause of neonatal sepsis. Early onset GBS disease occurs within 7 days of age and is linked to intrapartum GBS exposure. Nationally, early onset GBS disease occurs in 2.3/ 1000 neonates, with GBS carriage rates in pregnancy of 21%. Infection after 7 days of age (late onset disease) is not thought to be related to intrapartum transmission. Unlike the USA and Canada, there is no UK GBS screening programme. Studies suggest increased GBS carriage in HIV-infected women and increased GBS disease in HIV-exposed uninfected neonates. The audit assessed GBS carriage in HIV-infected women and GBS disease in HIV-exposed uninfected neonates to guide antenatal management. Methods: Retrospective audit of 254 HIV-infected pregnant women delivering at St Mary's Hospital, Manchester (March 2008 -November 2015 . Maternal information was reviewed including GBS carriage on high vaginal swab or mid-stream urine samples, and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. Neonatal records were reviewed for GBS status including CSF and blood cultures. Results: 37 women (15%) had HIV diagnosed in pregnancy. 147 women (58%) were on treatment prior to conception. 100 women (39%) were tested for GBS in pregnancy with a carriage rate of 16% on high vaginal swab. Women diagnosed with HIV in pregnancy did not have higher GBS carriage. There was no difference in baseline viral load or CD4 count in pregnancy between the whole cohort and those carrying GBS. There was also no observed reduction in GBS carriage in those on anti-retrovirals prior to conception. Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis was used appropriately in all cases. No baby tested positive for GBS in either early or late onset disease investigations (40 blood cultures and 4 CSF cultures <7 days, and 9 blood cultures and 2 CSF cultures >7 days). Conclusion: The cohort GBS carriage rate was 17% which is comparable to national figures. Viral load, CD4, and being on treatment prior to conception did not affect GBS carriage rates. There were no cases of early or late onset GBS disease. This supports the current UK practice of no routine screening for GBS carriage, and contradicts studies suggesting increased GBS carriage in HIV-infected women and increased GBS disease in HIV-exposed uninfected neonates.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1077, "end": 1099, "text": "Manchester (March 2008", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1100, "end": 1114, "text": "-November 2015", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P43"}, {"text": "Predicting future cardiovascular risk in adolescents with perinatally acquired HIV R Karunaratne and C Foster Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK Background: Early data suggests that perinatally HIV-infected (PaHIV) young people may have an increased risk of cardiovascular (CVS) disease in adulthood, attributed to both the prolonged exposure to HIV and antiretroviral therapy (ART). Whilst CVS risk algorithms are commonly used in adults, comparable tools for young people are less developed. The Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth (PDAY) coronary arteries (CA) and abdominal aorta (AA) risk scores are a weighted aggregate of modifiable risk factors: dyslipidaemia, cigarette smoking, hypertension, obesity, and hyperglycaemia, and have been validated in US adolescent populations but with minimal data in PaHIV cohorts. Methods: PDAY scores were calculated for adolescents aged 15-19 years on ART using retrospective observational cohort data from electronic records between November 2015 and January 2017. PDAY score >1 is strongly associated with the presence and intensity of subclinical coronary and abdominal atherosclerosis at autopsy 25 years later. A baseline PDAY risk score of \u22652 in adolescence is associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis in middle age.

In September 2016 he was admitted from dialysis after becoming unresponsive and hypertensive (220/150 mmHg); he suffered a single self-terminating seizure. CT head showed deep white matter hypodensities but no haemorrhage or infarct. Blood pressure (BP) was extremely labile, GTN and labetalol infusions were commenced but on-going seizure activity warranted intubation.

He had a prolonged period of ventilation; BP control remained difficult, he received methylprednisolone and IV immunoglobulin to cover vasculitis as a differential diagnosis; although imaging and serology did not suggest this. A hypertension screen was negative and syphilis serology confirmed response to recent treatment. Eventually his clinical condition improved and he returned to the ward.

It's a particular concern as TDF especially is now more widely used for PrEP and PEP. There is data to suggest that TDF targets proximal tubular mitochondria, however, the exact mechanism of TDF nephrotoxicity is still not clear. Histopathologically, it is characterized by proximal renal tubular injury and dysmorphic mitochondria.

Methods: We identified all HIV-1 infected individuals who had renal biopsy performed over the past 10 years at the Western General Hospital. We included those individuals who were on TDF containing regimen at the time of renal biopsy. Data were retrospectively collated through electronic patient records and pathology records. Descriptive statistics were performed. Results: Of the 23 individuals who had renal biopsy, we included 10 (3 female) who were on TDF containing regimen.

There is a two to tenfold increased risk of venous thrombosis in comparison with a general population of the same age. Many aspects of VTE and HIV infection have described in detail in the literature. However, there has been little information on hepatic vein thrombosis (HVT) in the HIV infected population.

Analysis included demographic data, associated co-morbidities, risk factors for thrombotic disease, anti-retroviral therapy, CD4 count and viral load. Results: In a cohort of 1000 patients 12 had thrombotic disease in the study period of 6 years. 7 females (58%) and 5 (42%) males, age 36-76 years. 50% had a nadir CD4 count less than 200 but at the time of the thrombotic event the CD4 counts were all greater than 200 with undetectable viral loads. 9 (75%) patients had a diagnosis of HIV for more than 10 years. 11 (92%) patients apart were on anti-retrovirals (ARVs) prior to a VTE for at least 6 years. 5 (42%) patients were on a protease (PI) based regimen and 7 (58%) non-PI based regimens. In 5 (42%) cases there were no risk factors for VTE. In the other 7 (58%) risk factors included recent surgery, antiphospholipid syndrome, combined oral contraception use, immobility, liver abscess and nephrotic syndrome.

We report a case of 34 year old HIV positive African woman who developed secondary amenorrhoea following the successful treatment of cerebral toxoplasmosis. Investigations revealed that she developed an isolated gonodotropin deficiency due to pituitary lesion. The rest of the pituitary function dynamic tests were normal. To the best of our knowledge, no similar case had been reported in an adult with cerebral toxoplasmosis. Case report: She was admitted with a three week history of fever, headache and rigors in February 2010. Examination revealed she was pyrexial at 39.0\u00b0C. She was alert with the GCS score of 15/15. HIV test was positive with CD4 counts of 54 cells/mm 3 (4%), HIV RNA level was 1.2 million copies/ml, HIV genotype was subtype C with no mutations. Serological test for toxoplasma revealed that ELISA IgMnegative, Dye test -4000 IU/ml, Toxoplasma IgM (ISAGA)negative, Toxoplasma Ig Gpositive. MRI scan showed a focal ring enhancing lesion in keeping with an underlying abscess. She was empirically treated for cerebral toxoplasmosis. Her headaches subsided and remained afebrile a week later. She then developed secondary amenorrhea a month after her initial presentation. Her pregnancy test was negative. She had regular periods prior to her current illness and had two healthy children. Endocrine tests showed low oestradiol due to isolated gonadotrophin deficiency. Discussion: Our patient presented with symptoms of raised intracranial pressure without any focal neurological signs. A high toxoplasma antibody titre along with a focal ring enhancing lesion in the brain was highly suggestive of cerebral toxoplasmosis. The response to anti toxoplasma therapy confirmed the diagnosis of cerebral toxoplasmosis. The complication of cerebral toxoplasmosis depends on the site of brain lesions. Our patient developed secondary amenorrhoea a month after development of cerebral toxoplasmosis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P55"}, {"text": "Conclusion: Clinicians should be made aware of this potential complication of pituitary dysfunction in patients with cerebral toxoplasmosis or any other central nervous system complications of HIV infection such as primary brain lymphoma or progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy. Results: 209 patients had a new HIV diagnosis and followed up during the audit period. 95%(199/209) had a HBsAb result at the baseline visit. 5%(10/ 209) were diagnosed with chronic HBV infection. Vaccination was indicated in 61%(128/209). 4-dose vaccine regimes (0,1,2,6 months) were indicated in 59%(75/128), booster doses in 36%(46/128), and ultra-rapid courses were given in 5%(7/128). 47%(60/128) received at least one vaccine dose within 6 months of HIV diagnosis. 23%(30/128) had completed the appropriate vaccine course during the audit period according to local guidelines. Of those requiring the 4-dose vaccine only 1%(1/75) completed 4 doses during the audit period, with 80% receiving 2 or less doses of the 4-dose vaccine regime. After introducing the guidelines update, there was a significant improvement in the uptake of high dose 4-dose vaccine regime compared to the low dose 4dose regime (54% vs 17%, p=0.0063). 50%(15/30) of patients who completed their vaccine course had their HBsAb results tested post-vaccine. Conclusion: With the implementation of the new guidelines, uptake of HBV vaccination had significantly improved, due to the consultation, education and presentation of the new guidelines, and introduction of a new HBV vaccination proforma. There is a low rate of HBV vaccine completion especially the 4-dose vaccine regimes in our population of newly diagnosed HIV individuals. A vaccination pathway and reminders to schedule HBV vaccination appointments may improve rates of HBV vaccination completion.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P55"}, {"text": "Anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) in a cohort of HIVpositive individuals: a retrospective data analysis D Lawrence 1 , J Vera 1 , D Richardson 1 , D Gilbert 2 , R Marchant 2 and C Morgan 2 1 Lawson Unit, Brighton, UK, 2 Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton, UK Background: Men who have sex with men (MSM) living with HIV are at increased risk of human papillomavirus (HPV) associated cancers including anal squamous cell cancer (SCC). Diagnosis of anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) presents an opportunity to initiate monitoring and curative treatment. The characteristics of patients diagnosed with AIN are poorly understood, as are the factors associated with progression from AIN to SCC. This project aimed to describe the cases of AIN in a large urban cohort of people living with HIV in the UK. Methods: We identified all cases of AIN among patients attending a single HIV outpatient care centre. We reviewed case notes and histopathology. Results: 23 cases of AIN diagnosed between 2002 and 2016 were identified: all white MSM. Median age 45 years (range 27-59), nadir CD4 434 cells/mm 3 (4-1312), median months since diagnosis 173 (24-339) and 100% on antiretroviral therapy (ART). 16/23 (70%%) had previous anorectal STIs, of those 15/23 (65%) had HPV, 5/23 (22%) had gonorrhoea, 4/23 (17%) had HSV and 2/23 (9%) had chlamydia. Where documented, 74% were current smokers. Most patients (83%) presented with an anal lump and the majority (83%) were AIN III. 13/23 (57%) were treated with imiquimod, 7/23 (30%) with surgical excision and imiquimod, 2/23 (9%) with electrocautery and imiquimod, and one patient with AIN I with surveillance. 11 patients had repeat histology: 5/11 (45%) progressed to SCC, 2/11 (18%) improved from AIN III to II and received additional imiquimod and 4/11 had resolved entirely. Patients who progressed from AIN to SCC did so over a range of one to nine years, had comparable age (median 52, range 39-72) and nadir CD4 (385 cells/mm 3 , 4-1312) to the broader cohort but were diagnosed with HIV further in the past (210 months, 159-226). Conclusion: AIN is an emerging issue for MSM living with HIV on effective ART. A large proportion of patients have had anal STIs before AIN diagnosis. In this small cohort 45% of patients progressed from AIN to SCC. Further research is needed to clarify which patients are most at risk of developing SCC. HIV infection and receptive anal intercourse are strong risk factors for anal SCC thus the highest incidence is found in HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) with anal human papillomavirus (HPV) the underlying cause in roughly 80% of cases. We aimed to describe cases of SCC in a large urban cohort of people living with HIV in the UK. Methods: We identified all cases of anal SCC amongst patients attending a single UK HIV outpatient clinic in spite of where they were diagnosed and treated. We reviewed case notes and histopathology. Results: 28 SCC cases were identified between 2001-2016 with a general increase in diagnoses each year: all were white MSM, median age 52 years (range 40-73), nadir CD4 310 cells/mm 3 (4-1312), average time of 14.8 years since HIV diagnosis and 25/28 (89%) on antiretroviral therapy (ART). 24/28 (86%) had documented sexually transmitted infection (STI) history, of those 21/24 (88%) had previously diagnosed anorectal STIs: 16/21 (76%) had HPV, 5/21 (24%) gonorrhoea, 4/21 (19%) chlamydia and 4/21 (19%) had herpes simplex virus. Common presenting symptoms were anal lump (75%), pain (21%), and rectal bleeding (17%). 25/28 (89%) had local disease, 3/28 (11%) had local nodes and there was no metastatic disease. 4/28 (14%) had previous diagnoses of AIN. Of those treated at our centre 8/13 (62%) were treated with chemoradiotherapy, 2/13 (15%) with radiotherapy alone, and 3/12 (23%) with surgery. 2/13 (15%) patients needed surgery after unsuccessful chemoradiotherapy. 2/14 (14%) were diagnosed with further AIN after successful SCC treatment. 5/28 (18%) patients have died, with two deaths attributable to SCC. Conclusion: Anal SCC is an emerging issue in MSM living with HIV on effective ART.

Examination revealed lower leg weakness (3/5), impaired sensation and absent knee and ankle reflexes. MRI spine was normal. CSF revealed a high protein and nerve conduction studies showed sensory and motor abnormalities without demyelinating features. Further investigation revealed a positive HIV test. In both cases CD4 count was high, indicating preservation of immune function. Treatment with IVIG showed minimal clinical improvement, but improvement was noted after initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Discussion: These patients presented with possible GBS; progressive symmetrical muscle weakness, arreflexia and high CSF protein level. Unexpected findings of pleocytosis and unusual nerve conduction results led to suspicion of HIV. HIV can present with neuropathy as a first presentation but distal sensory polyneuropathy or toxic neuropathy is more common. There is an association between HIV and GBS but the incidence of this is low. The incidence of GBS in the HIV population is similar to the non-HIV population. GBS typically occurs early in the course of HIV infection or at seroconversion while CD4 counts are high. The presentation, course and management of GBS in HIV seropositive and seronegative patients is similar but there is evidence of improvement with antiretroviral therapy in HIV positive patients. Background: HIV-associated TB contributes substantially to the burden of TBassociated morbidity and mortality. Survival is improved with early antiretroviral therapy (ART), following initiation of TB therapy. We investigate the quality of HIV care among individuals diagnosed simultaneously with TB and HIV. Methods: Comprehensive cohort data on adults (15 + years) diagnosed with HIV in the UK between 2010 and 2014 were linked to the national Enhanced TB surveillance system with follow-up to end of 2015. Individuals were considered simultaneously diagnosed ('co-infected') if they had a TB and HIV diagnosis within three months. Time lags from HIV diagnosis to first CD4 test date (as proxy for link to care), ARV initiation and first viral load (VL) <200 copies/mL were calculated. Results: Between 2010 and 2014, 20,548 adults were diagnosed with HIV and subsequently linked to HIV care and of these 523 (2.5%) were co-infected with TB. Median time from HIV diagnosis to HIV care among co-infected persons was 5 days [IQR 1-18.5] with 85% linked to care within 1 month. These figures were similar to without a TB diagnosis (6 days [0-20] and 81% linkage). No difference by CD4 count was observed. Median time to ART initiation was 27 days and 41 days [20-81] for co-infected persons with a CD4<100 and 100-349, respectively, and similar to that of those without a TB in diagnosis in the same CD4 strata. Among those with a CD4>350, co-infected adults started ART sooner than their counterparts without TB (median 77 days [41-281] vs 388 days ). Among those diagnosed with a CD4<100, 57% started ART within 14 days of TB diagnosis and 74% within 30 days. Following ART initiation and where VL was available, 95% of TB-HIV adults achieved viral suppression within 9 months [range 3-15 months] regardless of CD4-cell count, similar to HIV-diagnosed adults without TB. Assuming missing VL=failure, these figures dropped to 74% and 85% respectively (missing values are more likely to reflect poor data quality than viral failure). Conclusion: Linkage to HIV care following HIV diagnosis is prompt regardless of TB coinfection. Differences in ART initiation by CD4 strata reflect guidelines and uptake is overall more prompt among co-infected persons. Viral suppression following ART initiation is high for all. Observed differences in time to ART initiation will continue to reduce with the 2015 'test and treat' guidelines for both co-infected and those diagnosed only with HIV.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Department of Infectious and Communicable Diseases, Glasgow, UK"}, {"text": "Auditing mortality among HIV patients in Coventry S Das 1 , S Allan 1 , H Taha 1 , S Bopitiya 1 , S Croxford 2 and A Timperley 3 1 Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust, UK, 2 National Infection Service, Public Health England, London, UK, 3 University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire, UK Background: Accuracy in reporting vital statistics is crucial. It is a legal requirement for all deaths to be reported to the national death register. Our aims were to assess the accuracy of death reporting, mortality among HIV patients and the impact of late diagnosis on mortality. Methods: Retrospective case notes review of deaths in HIV patients (Jan. 2005 to Dec. 2012). Death data were obtained from Public Health England (PHE) which receives death reports from clinicians and through the death register. PHE data were compared to death data obtained from the Trust's electronic patient records and hospital paper notes. Results: There were 46 deaths reported to death register from our hospital.

Three weeks after initiation she developed a severe maculopapular rash over trunk and limbs with no systemic features or mucosal involvement. Treatment was stopped and systemic steroids initiated. Symptoms resolved and the combination of efavirenz and Truvada was commenced. Symptoms recurred and emtricitabine (FTC) or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) were suspected as likely causes. The regimen was switched again to raltegravir 400 mg BD and darunavir/ritonavir 800 mg/ 100 mg OD. She remained on this regimen without adverse effects until 2016. In 2016 she asked if there were options to simplify her regimen due to multiple lifestyle factors. Rechallenge with a desensitising titration of FTC and TDF was discussed with the patient and subsequently arranged. Methods: Darunavir/ritonavir and raltegravir were continued. The patient had frequent pharmacist reviews and a personalised care plan addressing what to do in case of adverse effects.

Data regarding benefits of earlier initiation of ART in elite controllers (EC) is less robust although studies have demonstrated ongoing immune activation, raised cardiovascular risk and possibly more hospitalisation of EC compared to individuals on ART. We wanted to investigate current management of EC and low level viraemic (LLV) patients within our cohort. Methods: Our database was interrogated to identify any EC or LLV patients (defined here as VL<200 copies/ml) seen in the year Dec 2015 to Dec 2016. Case notes were then examined to identify any discussion/advice about starting ART with respect to contemporary data. Results: 33 patients were seen in the allotted time frame (23 EC and 10 LLV). Three elite controllers were seen only once on diagnosis and not seen again, leaving 30 patients for analysis. The median time from diagnosis in EC was 39 months; in the LLV patients it was 24 months. Median CD4 percentage was 35% (20-44%), the median CD4:CD8 ratio was 0.9 (0.3-1.3) of whom 5 had a ratio \u22640.5. Of the ECs, 8 (40%) had a documented discussion regarding rationale for starting treatment in the last year; all had declined. Of the patients with LLV, 5 (50%) had a documented discussion regarding starting ART in the last year. Four declined and one is currently considering it. There was no association between the CD4% and CD4:CD8 ratio as to whether the patient was offered treatment. Conclusion: In line with current guidelines, amongst our cohort there is no clear consensus on treating people with well controlled HIV not receiving ART, and there are some discrepancies in whether discussion takes place about treatment between physicians. We suggest, as a minimum, a documented discussion about treatment with all patients off treatment at least once a year, and that treatment is recommended at CD4:CD8 ratio of \u22640.5 as indicated by the START data.

S Raffe, K Simmons, M Shaw, Y Gilleece and D Churchill Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust, UK Background: Significant prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG) can cause sudden cardiac death. A number of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs have been shown to prolong the QT interval, a particular concern when used in combination with other QT prolonging medications. A manual calculation of the QT interval, corrected for heart rate (QTc), is recommended when evaluating the risk of these medications. We evaluated the knowledge of ARV prescribers regarding QT prolonging medications and their ability to calculate the QTc. Methods: Using convenience sampling, delegates at Autumn BHIVA 2016 were asked to complete an anonymous questionnaire. This included the calculation of a QTc interval using Bazett's formula. The American Heart Association definition of a normal QTc was used (women <460 ms, men <450 ms). The \"gold standard\" or correct QTc was calculated using the \"teach the tangent\" method. Results: Thirty-three clinicians completed the questionnaire: 2 professors, 27 consultants and 2 registrars. Only 6 (18%) were able to correctly define a normal QTc. 15 (45%) underestimated the values, 2 (6%) overestimated the values, 8 (27%) stated they had no idea and 1 (3%) stated they would check google. Review of product characteristics identified 6 ARVs where a QTc prolonging effect had been seen. Efavirenz was correctly identified by 12 (36%), rilpivirine 19 (58%), atazanavir 13 (39%), darunavir 14 (42%), saquinavir 16 (48%) and ritonavir 14 (42%). Only 4 (12%) clinicians correctly identified all 6 agents and only 2 (6%) identified the 6 agents without including additional agents in their answer. 19 (58%) included a drug with no known QTc prolonging effect in their selection. Cobicistat was the agent most frequently incorrectly identified as causing QTc prolongation 14 (42%). 26 (79%) clinicians calculated a QTc from the sample ECG. The average answer was 402 ms but answers ranged widely (130-460 ms). Only 3 (9%) gave the \"gold standard\" answer of 459 ms with a further 5 (15%) within 10 ms. Conclusion: Significant variation was seen between HIV clinicians when manually calculating the QTc consistent with findings reported elsewhere (including among cardiologists). Our cohort generally underestimated the QTc which has implications for patient safety. Poor knowledge on which ARVs do and do not cause QTc prolongation may also be impacting on choice of ARV regimen. in the UK. The British HIV Association 2015 Audit identified low rates of monitoring of cardiovascular risk. Observational data has implicated protease inhibitors with increased cardiovascular and renal risk, but evidence is mixed. There is little UK data on prevalence of cardiovascular risk in those people living with HIV who take protease inhibitors. We aimed to describe the burden of risk in our cohort. Methods: We conducted a point prevalence audit of 149 HIV positive patients on protease inhibitor therapy from a cohort of 1200 on ART. We extracted data from our database, and local laboratory data. We used this to calculate Edinburgh CVS risk, BMI as a proxy for metabolic syndrome, and D:A:D renal risk. Results: Baseline demographics are similar to our wider cohort: 68% of the population were male, 62% were of white ethnic origin and 33% of Black ethnic origin; 45% of cases were acquired by sex between men, 47% via heterosexual sex; the mean age was 44. A resistant virus was the reason for PI use in 40%. 55% had a nadir CD4 of less than 200/mm3. In 72% of patients, ritonavir-boosted darunavir was the protease inhibitor used; 67% of patients were on a tenofovir containing regimen. 35% were current smokers. The prevalence of a recorded diagnosis of comorbidity included 20% with hypertension, 10% with chronic kidney disease, 3% with diabetes, and 1% with prior cardiovascular disease. 23% of patients had a 10-year cardiovascular risk of greater than 10%. The mean BMI was 27; 58% of patients had a BMI greater than 25. The mean D:A:D renal score in those without chronic kidney disease was 4.2%. Conclusion: The limitations are the lack of validated tools for cardiovascular risk (the QRISK is favoured by GPs and BHIVA) in HIV patients. We did not study end events such as myocardial infarctions. We did not compare against patients on other \"third agents\": the increased risk we observed may reflect a population trend within those on protease inhibitor therapy. This 'real world' audit of UK patients receiving protease inhibitors indicates a high burden of cardiovascular and renal risk. In addition, the BMI as proxy for metabolic syndrome is significant. This highlights an urgent need to improve monitoring and management and re-evaluate PI use in patients with wildtype virus. Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of liverrelated mortality in people living with HIV, where co-infection with hepatotropic viruses accelerates the course of chronic liver disease. The ALBI grade is a novel biomarker of liver dysfunction in HCC, however its prognostic significance has not yet been evaluated in patients co-infected with HIV. Methods: Using uni-and multivariable analyses, we studied the ALBI grade as a predictor of overall survival (OS) in a large, multi-centre cohort of patients with HIV-associated HCC recruited from 39 centres in 9 countries within the Liver Cancer in HIV study group. Results: A total of 387 patients, predominantly HCV co-infected (78%) with balanced representation of all Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stages (A=33%, B=18%, C=37%, D=12%) were recruited. At HCC diagnosis, 84% had been on anti-retroviral therapy, for a median duration of 8.8 years. The ALBI grade stratified patients into 3 groups with significantly different overall survival. Grade 1: median survival 97 months (95%CI 13-180), grade 2: 17 months (95% CI 11-22) and grade 3: 6 months (95%CI 4-9), p<0.001. A more advanced ALBI grade also correlated with lower CD4 counts and higher HIV viraemia (p<0.001). Conclusions: In this large, multi-centre retrospective study, we validated the ALBI grade as a biomarker of survival in HIV-associated HCC.

Recent data suggest that outside trials, patients with HIV/HCV may experience lower SVR rates. Methods: Data were gathered on all patients with HIV/HCV undergoing treatment (Rx) with DAAs from 1.7.14-1.12.16 at 2 centres in S. London. All were discussed by a multidisciplinary team (MDT) who decided Rx type, duration, use of ribavirin (RBV). Options were sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (SOF/LDP), paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir (PrO) plus dasabuvir (ProD), sofosbuvir/ daclatasvir (SOF/DAC) or SOF with RBV or pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) according to NHSE genotype based guidelines. Continuous variables are expressed at median (IQR). Results: 107 patients started DAA Rx, 70 have reached the SVR 12 timepoint. Demographics see table. Of the total group, all were on ART, 21 (30%) had to alter regimen prior to DAAs due to drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Of the group who reached 12 weeks post Rx SVR, 33 (47%) were cirrhotic, including 7 (10%) with decompensation. 5 were post OLT. All had undetectable HIV RNA. 22 (31%) were previous null responders to PEG-IFN. 8 (11%) were HCV reinfections having been successfully treated before with PEG-IFN. 55 received ribavirin (RBV); RBV level 2.2 mg/L (1.6, 2.6). Baseline HCV RNA in table. 69/70 (98.5%) achieved a 12 week post Rx SVR. The one relapse was a young woman, non-cirrhotic, treated with 8 weeks SOF/LED with no RBV. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that patients with HIV/HCV and advanced liver disease achieve excellent SVR rates. Joint management by both HIV and liver physicians is essential to consider Rx duration, use of RBV and optimise DDIs.

Measurements of food intake, body composition, arterial stiffness, inflammation, CVR and fasting blood lipids were conducted at baseline, month 6 and 12. Between-group changes of CV risk factors were assessed using ANCOVA, with adjustments for baseline values of the dependent variables. Analysis was by intention to treat.

Reduced bone mineral density (BMD) is associated with chronic HIV infection, antiretroviral therapy (ART) and traditional risk factors. BHIVA recommend assessment via FRAX score at diagnosis, prior to starting ART and every three years thereafter. FRAX has not been validated in HIV and it is unclear if HIV should be considered a cause of secondary osteoporosis. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan is recommended for those at increased risk, all women >65 and men >70 years. The BHIVA National Audit 2015 highlighted poor performance nationally. Methods: We reviewed case notes of patients over 40 attending a single HIV clinic in October 2016 and compared with a local audit in 2014. We recorded risk factors for low BMD, when FRAX scores were calculated, and DXA results. We calculated FRAX scores with and without HIV included as a cause of secondary osteoporosis. Results: 74 cases were included (47% female, mean age 52, range 40-82), mean duration of infection 178 months (2-380). 78% had a CD4>350 cells/ mm 3 (41-1292), 99% on ART, 75% of whom had ever taken TDF. 85% had a viral load <40 c/mL. Where documented, the most common risk factors were white ethnicity (68%), age \u226550 (64%), smoking (32%), and alcohol intake >3 l/day (20%). Two patients had previous fractures, one of whom was on osteoporosis treatment. Bone health was discussed in 36% of cases. FRAX scores were calculated at diagnosis in 1%, on starting ART in 3% and in 9% of patients in the last 3 years. 13% had previous DXA scans.

Conclusion: These findings are similar to BHIVA National Audit figures but were significantly improved from local figures in 2014 when 1% of patients had bone health discussed. There is however huge room for improvement. Clinicians need to discuss bone health regularly and calculate FRAX scores as per BHIVA guidelines.

Little is known about PD in the context of HIV; one report of 15 individuals from France showed no change in PD incidence or clinical course, but individuals reported specific hallucinations and increased impulsive behaviours. Four individuals experienced unusual motor deterioration. No interactions between antiretroviral therapy (ART) and PD treatment were found. There is no published data from the UK. We aimed to describe all cases diagnosed at a single HIV outpatient clinic in the UK. Cases: Four males with PD were identified from a total 4652 patients who had ever accessed a single HIV clinic. Two had Parkinson's Plus syndromes; one had Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and one had Lewy Body Dementia. Age at PD presentation ranged from 65-77 years. Time of HIV diagnosis to PD diagnosis ranged from 0-25 years. All individuals were diagnosed by a neurologist and had normal MR imaging of the brain bar mild ventricular prominence in one case. Differential diagnosis included HIV dementia. Three individuals experienced postural hypotension, in two cases preceding diagnosis, which has previously been linked to HIV Parkinsonism. One individual had a DaTSCAN and lumbar puncture due to diagnostic uncertainty, which showed significant changes in the basal ganglia indicative of PD and minimal CSF viral escape (91 copies/mL). Management of chronic HIV was impacted by the PD diagnosis. In one individual confusion was exacerbated by dolutegravir. Three individuals had swallowing difficulties impacting drug administration. The individual with CSF viral escape had his ART intensified to increase CNS penetration. As individuals experienced progressive disease, issues such as Power of Attorney and Next of Kin became important and with this, disclosure of HIV status. Conclusions: Similar to the previous case series, the onset of PD in these four men living with HIV occurred at a prevalence similar to that of the general population, with no clear link with HIV infection.

Compared with subjects with persistent HBeAg-positivity, those with HBeAg loss were older (median age, 35 vs. 40 yrs), and had higher median BL ALT (84 vs. 115 U/L), a higher prevalence of presumed cirrhosis (Fibro-Test \u22650.75: 6.8% vs. 15.9%), and lower median BL serum HBV DNA (8.0 vs. 7.6 log10 IU/mL) (all P < 0.005). Patients with HBeAg loss had greater median decline in HBV DNA at Week 12 (4.6 vs. 4.3 log10 IU/mL; P = 0.009), but not Week 48 (6.1 vs. 6.2 log10 IU/mL; P = 0.573). In multivariate analysis, independent predictors of HBeAg loss included older age (OR per yr: 1.03 [95% CI 1.01-1.05]; P = 0.002), higher BL ALT (OR per U/L: 1.005 [1.003-1.008]; P < 0.001), and lower HBV DNA (OR per log10 IU/mL: 0.74 [0.64-0.87]; P < 0.001). HBV DNA suppression at Week 12 was not significant. Conclusions: A minority of subjects treated with TAF or TDF experience HBeAg loss with 48 weeks of treatment.

For postmenopausal HIV+ women, the combined effects of oestrogen depletion and HIV may place them at particular risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We describe the prevalence of CVD risk factors in women aged \u226550 participating in the POPPY study, exploring the effects of HIV and menopausal status. Methods: This analysis is based on data from 86 HIV+ women aged \u226550 and 109 similarly-aged HIV-women. Women reporting that they had stopped menstruating were defined as postmenopausal. Chi-square tests compared the proportions with a CVD risk in each group. Results: Median (range) age of HIV+ and HIV-women was 54 (50-74) and 57 (50-86) years, respectively. Among HIV+ women, median CD4 count was 664 (58-2460) cells/lL and most (n=84) were on antiretroviral therapy. There were no significant differences in the prevalence of key CVD risk factors according to HIV status either overall, or in women who were postmenopausal (n=161, 83% of total, Table) . Only 12 (16.9%) and 11 (12.1%) of postmenopausal HIV+ and HIV-women were receiving lipid-lowering drugs (LLDs, p = 0.52), with 20 (28.2%) and 16 (17.6%) receiving anti-hypertensives (p = 0.13). Among HIV+ women there were an additional 42 and 19 women who met established criteria for LLDs or anti-hypertensives (11 and 16 of HIV-women, respectively) but were not receiving either class of drug, with no significant between-group differences. Conclusions: Within this small cohort, we report similar CVD risk factors among HIV+ and age-matched HIV-women. However, a substantial number of women with high CVD risk and/or hypertension were not receiving medication for these conditions. Clinicians should be aware of CVD risk in women ageing with HIV, and ensure they are treated in accordance with BHIVA guidelines. Conclusion: NCI was observed in 37.2% of this cohort.

This may be due to antiretroviral therapy, hepatitis B or C coinfection. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasingly diagnosed in these patients. Previous studies have shown the prevalence of NAFLD to be higher than that of the normal population. NAFLD can co-exist with viral hepatitis, and could cause a faster progression to fibrosis. This study investigated the prevalence of persistently raised ALTs and characteristics associated with these in a HIV positive cohort. Methods: Patients with persistently raised ALTs were identified and the causes for these were investigated. Demographics and laboratory parameters were collected to identify factors associated with NAFLD. HIV mono-infected and HBV/HCV co-infected patients were included. Ultrasonography and transient elastography were used to identify NAFLD and liver fibrosis. Results: 4.3% (n=44) of HIV positive patients were found to have persistently raised ALTs. 11 patients were excluded from further investigation due to alcohol excess (n=8), autoimmune liver disease (n=1), out of area (n=2) or deceased (n=2). Out of the 31 remaining patients, 71% had a BMI over 25, and 12 classified as obese. 48.4% (n=15) of the patients met the criteria for metabolic syndrome. A small proportion of patients had undergone investigations of raised ALTs by their clinician. Data on patients who underwent investigations for liver disease are presented: 12 out of the 13 patients who underwent liver ultrasound had findings suggestive of some degree of NAFLD. 10 out of 12 of these patients had a BMI>25, and 11 had some amount of dyslipidemia. 6 out of 11 patients who underwent transient elastography had liver stiffness values indicating significant liver stiffness. Further data will be available in the next couple of months. Conclusion: There was a surprisingly low prevalence of transaminitis in this cohort compared to previous studies. This study found that transaminitis was frequently inadequately investigated by clinicians. More research is required into the prevalence of NAFLD within the HIV population, especially within the UK.

Results: At the time of cancer diagnosis, the median CD4 cell count was 616 mm 3 , 33 (97%) were on cART of whom 31 (94%) had an undetectable HIV viral load. All patients presented with symptoms as there is no national PSA screening programme. The median serum PSA at presentation was 10 ng/mL and the Gleason score at biopsy ranged from 6 to 10. There was no correlation between histological grade of the tumour and CD4 cell count at cancer diagnosis (p=0.21).Three patients had metastatic disease at diagnosis whilst 31 patients had localised disease. Nineteen patients (61%) with localised disease were treated with radical therapy with curative intent, 11 with radical prostatectomy and 8 with external beam radiotherapy (of whom 3 required subsequent salvage surgery). Twelve patients (39%) with localised disease did not receive radical therapy and were monitored with close surveillance, in 10 cases this was because the localised tumour was low grade (Gleason 6). The median follow-up is only 2 years (maximum 11 years) but the 5 year overall survival is 94% (95%CI: 88-99%) and only one patient who presented with metastatic disease, has died. Conclusions: Outcomes for the treatment of localised prostate cancer in PLWH is excellent. We would strongly suggest that PLWH with localised prostate cancer are offered the same treatment strategies as patients who are HIV seronegative, including access to radical prostatectomy.

Choosing an NRTI backbone has often involved balancing potential for renal and bone toxicity with that of increased cardiovascular (CV) risk. Where these risks are unacceptable a complex nucleoside sparing regime has been the alternative. Studies have shown tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) to be less detrimental to renal and bone health than tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and would be an ideal choice in this situation. We present data of early clinical experience with TAF in patients with abnormal renal parameters or risk factors. Methods: Patients prescribed TAF between May-November 2016 for a renal indication were identified from clinic records. A retrospective chart review was conducted and data collected included relevant risk factors, previous ARV therapy and renal markers at intervals post TAF initiation. Results: 16 patients were prescribed a TAF based regime for a renal indication. Mean age 55 years (range 46-72). 15 Caucasian and 1 Black African. All patients were treatment experienced and switched from TDF/FTC backbone in 13 (81%), ABV/3TC backbone in 2 (13%) and NRTI sparing regimen 1 (6%). Post -switch TAF regimen was TAF/FTC/ELV/c in 10 (63%) and TAF/FTC + 3rd agent in 6 (37%) patients. Regarding comorbidities, 4 had hypertension, 3 known CV disease and 2 increased CV risk. Reason for initiation of TAF was identified as elevated uPCR in 8 (50%) patients and increased creatinine in 7 (44%) patients. Noteably 1 patient had previous renal toxicity with TDF in addition to high CV risk. Renal parameters were recorded at week 0, 12 and 24: Median creatinine clearance (CrCl) was 79.4 mL/min, 87.5 mL/min and 90.85 mL/min respectively. Median uPCR was 26 mg/mmol, 16 mg/mmol and 14 mg/mmol respectively. 1 patient with previous TDF toxicity had a CrCl of 92.6 mL/min at week 0 and 87.5 mL/min at week 12. All patients were virologically suppressed at week 24. Conclusion: Early clinical experience of TAF in mild-moderate renal impairment is similar to outcomes of large Phase III trials. Our data suggests an improvement in both CrCl and uPCR in patients with identified renal risk.

Data suggest that WLWH may undergo earlier menopause and suffer more associated ill-health than women without HIV [1]. Moreover, the potential for interactions between antiretrovirals and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) underscores the need to develop experience in managing this growing cohort of women. In 2015 we established a monthly HIV menopause service overseen by a gynaecologist and an HIV physician. We describe here the characteristics of WLWH attending the clinic. Results: 24 WLHIV attended. Median age at first attendance was 49; 79% were referred by their HIV clinician. 58% were Black. Mean year of HIV diagnosis was 2002 (range 1986-2015); median baseline CD4 count was 177 cells/lL. 25% had a previous AIDS defining illness. All were on antiretroviral therapy (ART); median last CD4 count was 654 cells/lL; 88% had viral load <50 copies/mL. Commonest symptoms were hot flushes (92%), menstrual irregularity (33%), labile mood/depression (33%) and vaginal dryness (25%). Median duration of symptoms before clinic attendance was 18 months. In 2 patients alternative diagnoses were sought before the diagnosis of menopause was made. 21% had early menopause (onset<45 years) or premature ovarian insufficiency (menopause onset<40 years). 50% of women who had a DEXA scan had osteopenia or osteoporosis. 83% initiated HRT or were already on HRT with the exception of 4 patients who either expressed concerns about HRT risk or no longer had symptoms at time of clinic attendance. Transdermal oestrogen with oral progesterone was the most frequently used HRT regimen. 85% of women seen at follow up described improvement in symptoms. Median time on HRT was 12.5 months. There were no HRT associated complications and no instances of ART modification. Conclusion: Menopausal women were likely to have a low nadir CD4 reflecting the number of years since HIV diagnosis and to be of African descent. Commonest presentation was vasomotor symptoms and a high proportion had osteopenia or osteoporosis. The long delay from onset of menopause symptoms to offer of treatment may be due to misdiagnosis or attribution of symptoms to HIV. Uptake of HRT was high. Methods: Retrospective analysis of people living with HIV or obstructive lung disease (OLD) aged \u226518 years who had a nasopharyngeal sample tested for respiratory viral pathogens between January 2010-August 2016. The multiplex PCR identifies: adenovirus, coronavirus, enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus. Results: Of 2024 samples identified, 1667 were PLWH and 357 had OLD. The HIV group was predominantly male (72%) and Caucasian (54%) with a median age of 45, and CD4 count of 453 cells/mm 3 (HIV load undetectable in 68%). The OLD group was predominantly female (55%) and Caucasian (70%) with a median age of 64. The proportion of samples with a respiratory viral pathogen detected did not differ significantly between the PLWH and OLD groups (558/ 1667 (33%) vs 134/357 (38%), p=0.13). This remained true when the analysis was restricted to those hospitalised with symptoms consistent with a viral respiratory illness (105/295 (32%) vs 89/281 (36%), p=0.32). Within the 692 positive samples, rhinovirus (overall 40%) was the most frequently isolated virus in both populations followed by influenza A (15%), influenza B (11%) and parainfluenza (8%). Influenza A (24% vs 13%, p=0.002) and parainfluenza 3 (10% vs 4%, p=0.005) were more frequently detected in the OLD group. In PLWH who had positive samples, a multivariate analysis showed age (OR 1.25 for each 10 years, 95%CI 1.02-1.52), female gender (1.42, 1.05-2.81) and low CD4 count (0.76 for each 100 cells/mm 3 increase, 0.70-0.84) were significantly associated with hospitalisation. In hospitalised patients with a positive sample (n=249), PLWH were more likely to have an abnormal CXR (47/ 120 vs 35/128, p=0.048) but less likely to be admitted to ICU (3/121 vs 14/ 128, p=0.008). The median length of admission was 5 days (range 0-50) in the OLD group and 6 days (0-82) in the HIV group (p=0.25). Conclusion: In our single centre study PLWH were less likely than OLD patients to have influenza A and parainfluenza detected. Our data suggest that this may reflect in part differences in age between the two populations.

We determined the association between HIV status and retinal vascular measurements, using retinal vascular photography, a noninvasive method of measuring CSVD. Methods: White, non-diabetic men in the multicentre POPPY cohort, comprising three demographically matched groups (HIV-positive [HIV+] aged \u226550 years; HIV+ <50 years; HIV-negative [HIV-] \u226550 years) were recruited into this ophthalmic substudy. HIV+ participants were all virologically suppressed. Optic disc centred 45\u00b0colour fundus photographs were used to calculate central retinal arterial (CRAE) and venous (CRVE) calibre as well as the arterio-venous ratio (AVR). Measurements from one randomly-chosen eye per participant were compared between groups using ANOVA. The association between HIV status and AVR was estimated using a multivariable linear regression model, adjusted for age and factors associated with AVR from bivariate models (p<0.2). Results: Included were 120 HIV+ \u226550 years (median age 59 [interquartile range 54-65]), 39 HIV+ <50 years (44 [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] ) and 52 HIV-\u226550 years (60 [55-65]).

In a multivariable model incorporating age, systolic BP, stroke and syphilis history, and recreational drug use, HIV status was associated with a 0.005 increase in AVR (95% confidence interval \u00c00.02, 0.03). Results: Overall prevalence of hypogonadism was found to be 66%. Secondary hypogonadism was more common, observed in 63.6% of these 66 patients and primary hypogonadism was found in 36.3% reflecting the effect of HIV/AIDS on hypothalamic pituitary gonadal (HPG) axis as well as direct testicular injury. 40% patients were symptomatic historically for hypogonadism. Statistically significant association (p=0.027) between hypogonadism and the level of immunodeficiency was found with an increase in prevalence and severity of hypogonadism as the CD4 counts decrease. Significantly lower levels of free testosterone and DHEAS were found in cases of severe immunosuppression and a direct correlation between CD4 counts and the levels of free testosterone as well as DHEAS was found indirectly reflecting the negative impact of high viral load on testicular as well as adrenal androgens. Anaemia was also found to be significantly more in patients with hypogonadism.

Historic diet and exercise interventions aimed to mitigate risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in PLWH treated with antiretrovirals (ARVs), demonstrating little effect on insulin resistance. This study recruiting HIV patients with prediabetes aimed to investigate the effect of a new diet and exercise intervention on diabetes risk. Methods: Patients attending urban HIV clinics stable on ARVs and with impaired fasting glucose (6.0-6.9 mmol/l) were invited to take part. Over 6 months at 4-weekly appointments participants were advised to change their diet and exercise in order to meet 10 goals based on the Mediterranean diet and diabetes prevention trials. Advice was individualised to meet cultural and socioeconomic needs. Pre and post intervention, diabetes risk was measured using a 3-hour frequently-sampled liquid meal tolerance test. A range of secondary outcomes was measured. Data was analysed using SPSS; t-tests estimated effectiveness. Results: Of 33 participants recruited 28 completed the intervention, achieving a median of 5 goals. There were statistically significant improvements in mean 6-month change in glucose and insulin for both fasting levels (5.5% and 23.6% reductions respectively) and postprandial 3hour incremental area under the curve (17.6%, and 31.4% reductions, p=0.023 and 0.017 respectively). There were significant reductions in mean values for weight (4.7%), waist (6.2%), systolic blood pressure (7.7%) fasting triglycerides (36.2%) and 10-year CVD risk (13.5%), and a significant increase in mean HDL (12.6%) and life satisfaction score (17.6%). There was no significant change in LDL, frailty or gut symptoms. Conclusion: Despite the potential for HIV infection and ARVs to increase diabetes risk, diet and exercise change can significantly reduce this risk. Additionally the intervention significantly reduced central obesity, hypertension, triglycerides, and CVD risk, but given the cohort was heavily treated with statins the absence of an effect on LDL was not surprising.

Therefore, laboratory diagnosis of opportunistic and HIV-associated infections by real-time PCR method allows assigning a necessary treatment in time and increasing the effectiveness of ARV therapy. PCR department of clinical laboratory at Kiev Regional Centre for Prevention Results: 26 co-infected patients were identified with 32 distinct infections (6 re-infections (19%)) (15 genotype (G) 1a, 2 G1b, 11 G3, 4 G4), 3 cirrhotic, 22/ 26 male with 15/22 MSM and 11/26 likely IVDU acquired. 15 patients treated locally using 27 treatment episodes. 18 infections received pegylated interferon (IFN)/ribavirin with SVR12 in 10 (56%). Subsequent regimens were: 1 IFN/ribavirin/simeprevir, 1 IFN/ribavirin/sofosbuvir, 2 AbbVie 3D \u00e2 , 1 AbbVie 2D \u00e2 , 5 Harvoni \u00e2 +/\u00c0 ribavirin with SVR 12 in 10/10 (100%). Hence, of the 16 patients treated to date SVR12 was achieved in 14/16 (87.5%). Of the remaining 12 infected patients: 2 are scheduled to commence treatment imminently, 4 G3 await funded IFN-sparing therapy, 2 treated elsewhere, 2 left region and only 2 poorly engaged with services. Side effects with IFNcontaining regimens were numerous with only one occasion when therapy was discontinued in a non-cirrhotic G3 patient who stopped interferon after 2 weeks to remain on sofosbuvir/ribavirin to completion at 12 weeks (SVR12 \u00aa 2017 The Authors HIV Medicine \u00aa 2017 British HIV Association, HIV Medicine, 18 (Suppl. S1), 14-70 negative). Dose reduction of ribavirin was undertaken according to levels of haemolysis to preserve haemoglobin. One patient developed antibody positive auto-immune myositis at cessation of treatment, probably precipitated by IFN. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) was commenced prior to hepatitis C treatment in 25/27 (93%) cases with care taken to avoid drug interactions (DI). All treated with direct acting antivirals (DAA) were discussed in a hub MDT as per commissioning arrangements. 2 patients required transient switch in ART to avoid DI whilst allowing for lowest cost acquisition hepatitis C therapy. 3 had had ART tailored to avoid DI in preparation for DAA therapy, highlighting the advantages of an integrated Infectious Diseases service. Conclusion: Our cohort demonstrates remarkable efficacy in real world data with SVR12 of 100% in patients treated with DAA therapy. The transformation in outcome in recent years is well demonstrated along with the ability to effectively manage complex co-infection in a DGH setting through an ID-led service with excellent patient engagement, few side effects and no major drug interactions. A high re-infection rate in this cohort was observed.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P104"}, {"text": "Weight gain in patients using integrase inhibitors: an emerging class side effect S Bhaduri 1 and M Roberts 2 1 Worcestershire Health and Care Trust, UK, 2 Worcestershire NHS Acute Trust, UK Background: The HIV service hosts a semi urban cohort of 260 patients. 69 patients are using integrase inhibitors (INSTI) as part of their antiretroviral regime. Some patients have complained of weight gain on this regime. We explore this observation further across this class of drugs. Methods: Case notes of patients using an INSTI were scrutinised for evidence of weight gain. We identified 5 patients where there was evidence of significant weight gain. Results: Case 1: 58 year old Caucasian female with co-morbidity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) switched from Atripla to Stribild. After 12 months exposure to Elvitegravir 9 kg weight gain was noted. After switching to Dolutegravir/Truvada, the weight increased a further 9 kg in 6 months. The CD4 remained stable with viral load suppression and no additional steroid requirement for RA. The patient was switched from Dolutegravir to Evotaz with weight reduction of 7 kg in 2 months. Case 2: 42 year old Black African male commenced Atripla but switched to Triumeq due to worsening renal function. His weight increased 16 kg in 9 months with a stable CD4 count 369/mm 3 and viral suppression. Case 3: 53 year old Caucasian male commenced Truvada/Darunavir/Ritonavir. Later Darunavir was switched to Dolutegravir with weight gain of 13 kg in 1 year with a stable CD4 and viral suppression. Dolutegravir was switched to Nevirapine with complete reversal of weight gain. Case 4: 56 year old Caucasian male, diagnosed with CD4 35/ mm 3 on Truvada/Raltegravir, switched to Triumeq/Darunavir owing to resistance with weight gain of 5 kg after 2 months when CD4 stable and viral load suppressed. Case 5: 37 year old Caucasian male diagnosed with CD4 34/mm 3 , viral load 1.5 m copies/ml. Commenced Truvada/Darunavir but switched to Triumeq for simplification. 4 months later weight gain of 13 kg was noted but CD4 had increased to 279/mm 3 with viral suppression. Conclusion: In this case series of 5 patients we describe an association between weight gain and INSTI exposure across 3 different INSTI. In 2 cases we have demonstrated reversal on switching off INSTI. An ACTG study highlighted the effect of Raltegravir exposure and weight gain which persisted despite adjusting for immune status. In two of our cases weight gain may have been further compounded by late diagnosis and immune reconstitution but overall this data supports the recent literature for INSTI exposure and weight gain, and furthermore suggests a possible class effect of weight gain on INSTI. This project aimed to review the demographics of these patients, the reasons for late presentation and the obstacles to timely diagnosis, and suggest improvements to primary, secondary and tertiary care services to reduce rates of late diagnosis. Methods: Retrospective analysis of case notes for adult patients diagnosed with late HIV between 1st June 2014 and 1st June 2016. All patients had a baseline CD4 count of 350 cells/mm 3 or below and were selected from a GUM clinic and infectious diseases unit in the same city. Results: 38 sets of notes were identified across two sites that met the criteria but 4 were not available, giving a final cohort of 34 patients. Baseline CD4 counts ranged from 0-350 cells/mm 3 and had a median of 205 cells/mm 3 . 16/ 34 (47%) patients identified as men who have sex with men (MSM), 16/34 (47%) as heterosexual and 2/34 (6%) as bisexual. 16/34 (47%) were tested due to being symptomatic or unwell. Of those cases where route of transmission was clearly documented (32/34, 94%), being an MSM was the suspected route of transmission in 18/34 (53%) cases and heterosexual in 12/ 34 (35%). 14/34 (41%) had a test indicator condition at diagnosis including sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia, cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia stage III, and mononucleosis-like syndromes. 4/34 (12%) had an AIDs defining condition including Kaposi's sarcoma, pneumocystis pneumonia and HIV encephalopathy. Conclusions: Both MSM and heterosexual populations are at risk of late diagnosis, as well as those from outside of the UK. A significant proportion of patients presented with severe AIDs defining conditions, suggesting missed HIV testing opportunities in other health services. We suggest that earlier testing would have led to fewer late diagnoses and less HIV-related morbidity; further local evaluation is required. Methods of expediting HIV testing include promotion and provision of home HIV testing, improved access to HIV testing for at-risk groups and education of healthcare professionals around HIV risk, sexual history taking and awareness of HIV indicator conditions. (Optimal use of other HIV prevention strategies, such as partner notification and pre/post exposure prophylaxis may also contribute to a reduction in late diagnoses).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P106"}, {"text": "\u00aa 2017 The Authors HIV Medicine \u00aa 2017 British HIV Association, HIV Medicine, 18 (Suppl.

Results: Multiple risk factors for delayed diagnosis were identified i.e.: Men who have Sex with Men (MSM); movement between health boards within and out-with the UK. All 4 patients presented with non-specific symptoms which were initially misdiagnosed as common presentations. Patients continue to present with indicators for HIV testing yet diagnosis is often delayed, worsening outcomes. Initial presentation of AIDS is commonly with non-specific common symptoms. As such it is vital to maintain a high degree of suspicion.

The BHIVA, BASHH, BIS 2008 testing guidance recommends testing for patients with oesophageal candidiasis, which occurs more frequently in HIV positive individuals at lower CD4 counts. The aim was to find out how many patients with oesophageal candida on gastroscopy (OGD) were tested for HIV and to identify possible barriers to testing. Methods: Data from the hospital endoscopy unit for the first 6 months of 2016 was reviewed for cases of candida on OGD. Patients were included based on endoscopy findings or histology. Lab results and case notes were checked looking for evidence of HIV testing within three months of the OGD, or discussions offering testing after OGD. After results were collected, a brief survey was conducted within the gastroenterology team regarding barriers to testing. Results: 78 patients were identified with candida, 6 excluded due to negative histology. Equal split men and women. 14 (19%) had HIV tests. Only one OGD report recommended HIV testing. No surgical patients were tested, 7% GP referrals, 40% AMU, 36% general medicine, 13% gastroenterology referrals tested. Some patients who were not tested also had symptoms of unexplained anaemia, weight loss or Hepatitis B or C all of which are listed as indicator conditions in the 2008 UK National Guideline for HIV testing. Patients were more likely to receive an HIV test if under 50 yrs old. Oesophageal candidiasis was often attributed to inhalers when no other cause could be found and patients with an active malignancy were less likely to be tested. Of note, many malignancies are more common in HIV positive individuals. Barriers to testing included lack of knowledge of the guideline and its recommendations, concerns regarding cost of testing and requirement of specialist test counseling for patients including time constraints and appropriate follow up. Conclusion: Only 19% of patients with confirmed oesophageal candida were tested for HIV highlighting missed opportunities for diagnosis. Many healthcare professionals are not aware of the National Guidelines for HIV testing and the indicator conditions for which testing is recommended. This highlights the need for increased and regular staff education across hospital specialties and General Practice to raise awareness of the guidelines and promote HIV testing as part of routine practice. Methods: Deaths among HIV patients occurring in 2015 were reported by London HIV care centres. Data were collected on demographics, diagnosis information, cause and place of death, most recent CD4/viral load (VL), ART status and reported adherence. Clinicians were asked whether each death was expected, defined as patients who were expected to die (eg. those receiving planned end of life care or with a terminal condition), or unexpected (eg. late presenters admitted at diagnosis and not responsive to treatment). Deaths were categorised using the CoDe Protocol. Results: 170 deaths were reported among HIV patients from 15/18 care sites, 70% were among men. The median age at death was 52 years for men and 47 for women. Most people died in hospital (60%; 36/157) or at home (23%; 36). Over 90% (141/156) of people were on ART and adherent (85% 121) at their last clinic visit. Of those not on ART, 79% (11/14) had a CD4<350 cells/mm 3 and 92% (12/13) a VL \u2265200 copies/ml. Over half of deaths (53%; 77/146) were unexpected. Of expected deaths, 57% (39/68) died in hospital. Median time from diagnosis to death was 9 years, with 30 (18%; 30/166) people dying within a year.

To reduce this several approaches need to be taken including increasing HIV testing rates. It is estimated 13,500 people living with HIV in the UK are unaware of their infection and risk of transmission is higher when people are not on highly active retroviral therapy (HAART). It is also important to identify those who may already be HIV positive before starting them on HIV post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to reduce risk of inducing resistance to antiretroviral therapy. HIV POCTs can provide faster results than standard serology testing and may be more acceptable to patients who suffer with needle phobia or who are anxious awaiting results. Therefore they can be used prior to prescribing PEP and it is anticipated they will increase HIV testing. Methods: To ascertain the utility and performance of the Alere HIV POCT it was piloted at a local sexual health department between 09/10/15-15/01/16. A HIV POCT was performed for those who were starting PEP, needle phobic, too anxious to await standard serology results or for another significant reason. A proforma was completed for each HIV POCT and a logbook completed. Results: In total 39 patients had a HIV POCT. There were several risk factors for HIV transmission including MSM (33%), HIV positive partner (37%) and partner from high prevalence area (3%). The most common reasons for HIV POCT were pre PEP (59%), anxiety awaiting standard serology (13%) and other significant reasons (13%). 95% of the HIV POCT results were negative and 5% were antibody positive. 92% were confirmed by standard serology HIV testing, 3% were not confirmed and 5% did not have confirmatory serology taken. Conclusion: All of the HIV POCTs where confirmatory serology was taken were confirmed apart from just 1 which accounted for the 3% not confirmed. That 1 test was performed by an untrained staff member. In future all HIV POCTs would only be performed by trained staff. The 5% of HIV POCTs where confirmatory serology was not taken was due to needle phobia. From the results it would appear the Alere HIV POCT is a sensitive and specific test.

The aim of this study was to review HIV testing of patients with aseptic meningitis or encephalitis as well as with specified organisms causing meningitis, as per guidelines. Methods: Clinical and laboratory data were collected between December 2012 and June 2016 for patients with encephalitis and meningitis in a single teaching hospital which also has a tertiary referral infectious disease unit. Patients were recruited prospectively according to predefined definitions for meningitis and encephalitis and stratified according to aetiologies.

Lessons from a systematic review of its use in stigmatised infectious diseases L Mulka 1 , JH Vera 1 , JA Cassell 1 and AJ Leigh-Brown 2 1 Brighton and Sussex Medical School, UK, 2 University of Edinburgh, UK Background: Phylogenetic information provides new horizons for clinical case finding in HIV, but raises issues of acceptability, privacy and even criminalisation. We reviewed studies describing the use of phylogenetics to directly inform case finding of undiagnosed contacts in community acquired stigmatised infectious diseases. Methods: A search in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PsychINFO for articles where phylogenetics have been used to facilitate case finding in sexually transmitted infections, TB, HBV or HCV, published until July 2016 in English. Results: 26 of 6042 papers screened met the inclusion criteria; 17 TB, 9 HIV. An additional 18 studies reported using phylogenetics to investigate discrete HIV outbreaks and trace sources but did not explicitly report its role in case finding. Case finding strategies included confirming the source of an outbreak to prompt wider investigation (HIV); contact tracing of phylogenetically clustered cases (TB, HIV); combined cluster and geographical information to target screening (TB); screening informed by discrepancies between genotypic and epidemiological data (TB); phylogenetic characterisation to inform a screening intervention (HIV); using linked epidemiological data to identify of a source (HIV); and contact tracing with genotype matching to a case with rapidly progressive disease (HIV). Facilitators included sharing molecular surveillance data to establish community support in targeted TB screening. Barriers included delayed results, time lapse between cases and refusal of access to premises for screening, however patient barriers were rarely reported. Ethical issues included media coverage of an HIV sources identity. Conclusion: Phylogenetics-informed approaches to case finding are feasible in stigmatised infections. However studies reporting their use in clinical and public health practice provide limited information on patient related barriers, acceptability, or on ethical challenges such as identification of \"core\" transmitters or criminalisation.

Although many UK organisations offer employee health checks, they do not include HIV testing. It was one of the first initiatives in the country to include HIV within employee health checks. The project was delivered in the East Midlands by 5 voluntary sector organisations and took place over a 9 month period. It aimed to reach men in the workplace (particularly migrant men from sub-Saharan Africa and Eastern Europe), and had an initial target of undertaking 300 HIV tests. Employees attending the health events were also able to receive a series of 15 additional text messages providing further information about HIV, Prep, Hep C, safer sex, general health and wellbeing and GP referral. Evaluation Method: The evaluation explored the feasibility, acceptability and potential sustainability of workplace HIV/wellbeing interventions, from multiple stakeholder perspectives (employees, companies and project partners). It adopted a mixed methods design using questionnaires, interviews, text messages and project monitoring data. Results: 776 employees from 50 different countries attended 20 workplace health events held in 11 different companies; one third of attendees were migrant workers. 52% of attendees undertook an HIV test. 75% of attendees had never had an HIV test before. 96% considered HIV testing to be an acceptable element of workplace health check and 79% felt they had learnt something new about their health. 465 (60%) of attendees signed up to receive the follow up text messages and 21 of these reported seeking an HIV test after the event. Conclusion: HIV testing in the workplace is highly acceptable. The events were able to reach a diverse group of employees, including those who had not previously tested. The project also suggests that mobile phone text messaging is an acceptable and well-received adjunctive method of motivating people to test and take action.

We aim to assess the newly diagnosed individuals in Lothian where prevalence is over 0.2% with no agreed policy to screen for HIV in order to understand current testing practice. Methods: Using our dedicated HIV database we included all new presenters to our services between April 2015 and April 2016. Data were retrospectively collated through electronic patient records. Descriptive statistics were performed to examine demographics, baseline characteristics and treatments. Results: We identified 51 individuals (3 female) who were newly diagnosed with HIV.

Statistical tests were carried out on this data to determine differences between those \u226550y and <50y. Significance is defined as P=\u22640.05. Results: 576 PLWH were included. 78 (13.5%) were \u226550 y, and the remaining 498 (86.5%) were <50 y. PLWH \u226550 y had a significantly lower number of episodes treated in sexual health per person in the 5 years prior to HIV diagnosis than the younger group (P=0.016). Late diagnosis was seen in 53.8% of those \u226550 y compared to 26.1% of those <50 y (P=0.001). Table 1 shows the facility of HIV diagnosis for both groups of PLWH, where this information was available. PLWH \u226550 y were significantly more likely to receive a diagnosis in primary or secondary care, whereas those <50 y were significantly more likely to be diagnosed in sexual health. We ascertained immediate cause of death in 40 of the 41 cases. Of the 40,18 deaths were directly related to HIV, and 22 were not. Of the 22 deaths not directly related to HIV, the most common immediate causes were malignancy (9), suicide (3), and sepsis (3).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 93, "end": 184, "text": "Source  ID  GUM  ID  GUM  ID  GUM  ID  GUM  ID  GUM  ID  GUM  ID  GUM  ID  GUM  ID  GUM  ID", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1590, "end": 1597, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}], "section": "P127"}, {"text": "Within the 18 HIV related deaths, the most common immediate causes were multi-organ end-stage HIV disease (4), lymphoma (4), and sepsis (4).

ART at diagnosis is now considered best practice for public health as well as clinical purposes. In 2015, 75% of gay/bisexual men starting ART had CD4>350 compared to 50% among heterosexuals. This suggests gay/bisexual men are more likely to start ART for treatment as prevention (TasP). We present demographic trends in ART initiation among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (\"men\" hereafter) with CD4>350. Methods: The UK has a comprehensive national open cohort of people with HIV from the point of diagnosis, with clinical updates from all sites. We analysed data on men starting ART (20,877) between 2010-2015 where both ART start dates and CD4 counts prior to ART start were available (66%: demographics similar to all men). We described trends in ART uptake and identify predictors for prompt initiation (<6 months from diagnosis) among those starting ART with CD4>350. Men diagnosed in the latter half of 2015 were excluded from multivariate analyses due to short follow up time. Results: The (adjusted) number and proportion of men starting ART with CD4>350 rose from 41% (942/2,298) in 2010 to 75% (2,930/3,906) in 2015 (equivalent figures for CD4>500 were 17% and 48%, respectively). Overall, 8,073 men starting ART were included in the study: 38% (3,405/8,073) with a CD4>350 CD4 started ART within 6 months and 25% (2,012) within 6 weeks of diagnosis, with improvement in more recent years (Figure) . The factors associated with prompt initiation among those with CD4>350 included: recent year ( Conclusions: Trends in CD4 at ART start reflect the evolution of national treatment guidelines.

K Corbett 1 , S Mann 1 , J Williams 2 and D Chadwick 2 1 Newcastle Medical School, UK, 2 James Cook University Hospital, Middlesbrough, UK Background: As significant proportion of people living with HIV remain undiagnosed, and studies suggest many patients who presented late had missed opportunities for testing in the years prior to diagnosis. One method of potentially testing such patients earlier is using software applications embedded in Order-Comms systems to identify patients at higher risk of HIV: when such patients attend clinics, surgeries or hospitals, the application prompts clinicians to add HIV tests to other tests ordered. However such applications will only be effective if patients with undiagnosed HIV attend medical facilities and undergo blood tests. This project aimed to determine if this was the case for a stable and local population presenting with HIV to a clinic in northern England. Methods: All new diagnoses of HIV presenting to our clinic (2012-2016) were reviewed. Patients who'd moved to the area within the last 5 years were excluded. Episodes of engagement with care resulting in blood tests were assessed within the WebICE (Order-Comm) system >3 months and up to 5 years before diagnosis. Reasons for ordering blood tests were reviewed to determine if indicator conditions were potentially present, and (in a subgroup with evaluable results) whether neutro/lymphopaenia, thrombocytopaenia or raised globulin were present. Results: 42 patients were reviewed (median age 44, median CD4 count at diagnosis 281, 90% male, 60% MSM). Overall 80% had blood tests ordered up to 5 years before diagnosis, 24% had a clear indicator condition and there was a median 1 year (per patient) when blood tests were done in the previous 5 years. Of these episode 65% occurred in primary care, 26% in hospital clinics and 9% in A&E or hospital inpatient episodes. In the late presenting group (CD4<350, n=25, median CD4 91) 84% had prior blood tests, there were a median of 2 years when blood tests were done and 38% had indicator conditions. In the subgroup analysed, 22/33 (67%) had blood dyscrasias or raised globulin (21/26, 81%, in the late presenters). Conclusion: A high proportion of patients with new diagnoses of HIV have had blood tests in the 5 years prior to diagnosis, with a significant proportion of the tests indicating blood dyscrasias or raised globulin. Technologies designed to prompt HIV testing using algorithms to detect previous abnormal blood tests amongst other risk factors, when other blood tests are ordered, are likely to be effective in enabling earlier diagnosis. HIV stigma remains a barrier to testing, treatment adherence, and is associated with sexual risk behaviours. We compare stigma experienced between heterosexual men and MSM, and investigate the influence of MSM engaging in chemsex has on HIV stigma. Methods: The People Living with HIV Stigma Survey 2015 was co-designed by people living with HIV and an advisory group of national experts. People were recruited from over 120 cross sector community organisations and 47 NHS HIV clinics to complete an online survey about their experience of living with HIV. Responses were anonymised, stored securely, and analysed with engagement from community members. Results: 1,162 men completed the survey, 969 (83%) identified as MSM, 243 (25%) of which reported engaging in chemsex in the past 12 months. 82% of MSM were white British or Irish compared to 32% of heterosexual men. MSM were less likely to report being in a relationship than heterosexual men (50% and 69% respectively). A multivariable analysis of social discrimination variables found that MSM were over twice as likely to report sexual rejection in the past 12 months compared to heterosexual men ). 36% of MSM reported sexual rejection in the past 12 months compared to 14% of heterosexual men. There was no difference in attributing this rejection to their HIV status, but was high for both groups (MSM Mean=70.2 SE=2.02; heterosexual men M = 74.5 SE=7.47). MSM who engaged in chemsex in the past 12 months were more likely to report sexual rejection compared to MSM who did not report engaging in chemsex (AOR 1.71 [95%CI 1.17-2.52]). Conclusion: MSM living with HIV in the UK experienced greater stigma and discrimination in terms of sexual rejection compared to heterosexual men, and this effect was exaggerated for MSM who had engaged in chemsex.

We audited access to MH services according to British Psychological Society guidelines and responded to the findings. Methods: 1. A retrospective notes review and phone consultations were undertaken for PLWH recently discharged from hospital. 2. A new service was established in response to findings and characteristics of service users are described for an 8 month period. Statistical analysis of factors associated with MHP was with Chi-squared or Fisher's tests. Results: 1. For n=73, 86% (63) were male, median age was 43 (29-66) years; HIV VL was undetectable for 78% (57); 26% (19) reported alcohol excess, 10% (7) recreational and 4% (3) injection drug use; 32% (23) reported current MHP and 38% (28) previous MHP. Recreational drug use was associated with current MHP (p=0.01). For 33 individuals with current and/or past MHP, 45% (15) participated in phone interviews, with 11 deemed unsuitable for a call and 7 uncontactable; 40% (6) felt health care professionals (HCP) had not given them sufficient opportunity to discuss their MHP and 40% (6) experienced stigma. 2. A weekly pilot joint HIV-psychiatry clinic was set up, with 11 patients discussed virtually, and 36 face to face appointments involving 14 patients; 14/14 were male; for 12/14 (86%), VL was undetectable. Diagnoses were: depressive (n=6) and/or anxiety disorders (5), personality disorder/trait (6) and other (4). A new psychiatric drug was started (4) or dose changed (1); for 8 individuals, an onward referral was made to psychological or other talking therapies. Median waiting time for an appointment was 35 days versus 60 days for conventional MH services. Seventy-one per cent (n=10) individuals completed feedback questionnaires; 9 were very satisfied or satisfied with the nature and timeliness of the information they received prior to attending, and that the appointment was beneficial for their current problem; 10 were very satisfied or satisfied with the appointment location. Conclusions: PLWH who were recent inpatients had a high prevalence of MHP; a significant minority felt they had not had sufficient opportunities to discuss their MHP.

D Friday, R Meade, S Botchey and G Brook London Northwest Healthcare NHS Trust, UK Background: As more and more HIV positive people are living long and healthy lives, it is important they have access to general practitioners (GPs) who have experience in treating a wide range of day to day health conditions. BHIVA recommend that patients are encouraged to register with a GP, if not already registered, and that the HIV service regularly communicates with the GP about their patient, including the creation of a care plan if appropriate. The objective of this review was to determine how many patients within our HIV service fail to disclose their status to the GP and to explore the reasons. Method: A retrospective review of the electronic patient records (EPR) was conducted and all patients whose clinic letters were not sent to the GP and those where the GP was not aware of status were selected. The following were recorded: demographics, duration of diagnosis, CD4 count, viral load, antiretroviral therapy and reasons for failing to disclose. Results: Overall, of the 1000 patients across two sites, only 32 patients failed to disclose to their GP. 19 (59%) males and 13 (40%) females.17 (53%) heterosexual, 13 (40%) homosexual and 3 (9%) bisexual. The majority 13 (30%) were between ages 45-55 with origins from Sub-Saharan Africa. Almost 60% of patients were diagnosed within the last five years, 4 (12%) between 5-10 years and 9 (28%) greater than 10 years. 29 (90%) were well established on anti-retrovirals (ARVs) of which 18 (62%) had utilized one to three regimens. The average CD4 count was greater than 400 and viral load fully suppressed. As anticipated most patients were first diagnosed in the GUM clinic, 21 (65%) and the remaining 11 (35%) in other specialities.

This qualitative investigation aimed to characterise these enablers and barriers. Methods: HIV patients with prediabetes attending urban outpatient clinics were invited to participate in a 6-month diet and exercise intervention. Those who completed, dropped out or declined to take part in the intervention were invited to participate in research interviews. Participants were purposively sampled to ensure maximum diversity. A topic guide was used, however participants were encouraged to speak freely. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed. Thematic analysis was conducted by the lead researcher using Framework aided by NVIVO software, and checked by collaborators to ensure rigour. Results: From 55 potential participants 23 consented to be interviewed, 19 who took part in the intervention, and 4 who declined. Analysis of interviews identified the key theme of fear of disclosure of HIV status. Participants felt happy to disclose development of diabetes but not HIV. Those who declined participation or achieved fewer intervention goals exhibited an external health locus of control, blaming diabetes risk on HIV medicines, and believing behaviour change futile. Those who achieved more goals considered prediabetes treatable, finding practical ways to surmount barriers. Enablers included a desire to avoid adding to pill or disease burden, and a strong support network. Deliberate weight loss leading to loss of cultural identity and disclosure of HIV status were significant barriers. Valorisation of overweight was a barrier to some from the African communities. Weight loss presented as a loss of identity for gay men who self-identify as bears (a sub-section of gay men who reject normative idealised lean muscularity, and are more likely to be hairier and heavier). Conclusion: The fear of disclosure of HIV should not be underestimated; it appears to affect desire or ability to change behaviour. It is not known if fear of loss of identity among gay men identifying as bears is specific to those living with HIV.

Research into the experiences of trans people living with HIV is lacking. We compare experiences of the stigma and discrimination in healthcare settings reported by trans people living with HIV in the UK with those of cisgender people.

We investigated the association between these risk behaviours, and assessed whether the presence of multiple risks is associated with measures of mental health among HIV-positive participants in the POPPY Study. Methods: Substance use was assessed via a detailed patient questionnaire and high-risk sexual behaviour was inferred from a sexually transmitted disease (STD) diagnosis in the last year. Mental health was assessed through 1) patient reported history of mental health conditions; 2) any current depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9] \u22655); and 3) current significant depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression [CES-D] \u226516).

However, adapting otherwise stable treatment on the basis of cost requires a different type of conversation and may be challenging for clinicians and could provoke patient anxiety. We sought to establish the attitudes towards changing ART in a range of different scenarios amongst stable, virologically-suppressed patients. Methods: A self-completed questionnaire was offered to all stable patients (on ART >6 months, undetectable HIV viral load and no plans for treatment change) over a four week period in December 2016. It elicited the patient's \u00aa 2017 The Authors HIV Medicine \u00aa 2017 British HIV Association, HIV Medicine, 18 (Suppl. S1), 14-70 level of satisfaction with current medication and their level of agreement (rated on a 5-point scale with \"strongly agree\"=5, \"strongly disagree\"=1) with changes in treatment in several different situations. Results: The questionnaire was completed by 50 patients. 64% of respondents were male and 46% were black-African. 47/50 (94%) agreed or strongly agreed with the statement \"I am happy with my current medications\" (mean score 4.6). Patients were most amenable to change their medications for a novel medication (score=4.32), to reduce side effects (4.19) and to take fewer tablets (4.07).Patients were more ambivalent to change medication if for a change to a generic form (3.95) and if recommended by a physician (3.98). Patients were more resistant to changing therapy based on cost improvement (3.40) with 48% agreeing/strongly agreeing with this, falling to 38% if the patient was made aware of the magnitude of the saving. Conclusions: Patients were happy with their current medications and were generally resistant to treatment change. Circumstances in which changes were viewed more positively involved those associated with a direct benefit to the individual. Patients were more adverse to changing medications if cost was the primary driver for change and awareness of the size of saving appeared unlikely to influence this. We plan to explore attitudes and knowledge around treatment change and generic therapy in a larger qualitative project. Background: Young people with HIV are a vulnerable group who have distinct needs. HIV may have been diagnosed at a time of huge transition in their lives. A desire to 'fit in' and avoid further stigma may increase the influences of peer pressure and risk taking behaviour. The use of drugs may increase sexual risk taking and compromise ability to adhere to ART. This increases risk of HIV transmission. There is little data about drug use in young adults with HIV. Our aim was to assess the use of recreational drugs among young people with HIV attending a dedicated young adult HIV service, in a large inner city HIV clinic. Methods: A questionnaire was designed and local ethics approval attained. All patients attending the young adult HIV service between June and Dec 2014 were provided with an anonymous questionnaire which they filled in privately and then posted into a secure box. The questionnaires were retrieved at the end of the study and data analysed. Results: 99 young people aged 17-26 completed the survey. Median age 22. 73/99 (74%) were male. 51/99 (52%) MSM, 40/99 (40%) heterosexual, 8/99 (8%) bisexual. 39%, 18% and 57% reported smoking currently, previously and never respectively. Respondents reported using the following drugs regularly: 50/99 cannabis, 31/99 cocaine, 19/99 MDMA, 29/99 Mephedrone, 15/99 Ketamine, 22/99 Viagra, 18/99 GHB/GBL. All drug use was more common among MSM compared with heterosexuals: 38/51 MSM reported regular or occasional drug use compared to 15/40 heterosexuals p<0.005. 5/8 Bisexuals reported drug use. 9/99 reported injecting drugs at least once. Only 8/99 felt their drug use was a problem for them, with 7/99 seeking help for their drug or alcohol problems. 24% reported unprotected sex because they were high on drugs. 66% of respondents were on ART; 16% reported missing ART as a result of drug use, and 12% had missed appointments in the HIV clinic. When asked about drug interactions, only 7% were aware that recreational drugs might interact with their ART. Conclusions: These data show that drug use is common among the young people attending our service, particularly MSM. Drug use lead to unprotected sex and missed ART in some cases, and could be an important factor in onward HIV transmission.

We investigate the usefulness of a validated resilience scale when applied to experiences reported by people living with HIV. Methods: The People Living with HIV Stigma Survey UK 2015 was codesigned by community members and HIV experts. 1,576 people recruited from 120 community organisations and 47 HIV clinics throughout the UK completed an anonymous online survey. Responses were stored securely and analysed at PHE with active community engagement. The validated Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC 10) was included in the survey. Scores of participants who answered >7/10 questions were calculated and the mean of all completed responses used to impute missing responses. Participants were classified as having low, medium, or high resilience using cluster analyses. Experiences of stigma and discrimination were compared for those with low and high resilience. Results: The majority of 1,568 participants responded positively to resilience questions: 64% often or nearly always were able to adapt to change and 63% to bounce back after hardship [mean resilience score 26.5/40 (SD 8.2)]. 429 (27%) had low, 611 (39%) medium, and 528 (34%) high resilience. In the past year those with low resilience were more likely than those with high resilience to have been diagnosed with depression (71% vs 22%) and experienced social discrimination (verbal/physical abuse and exclusion) (46% vs 23%), anxiety (53% vs 24%) and/or avoided social/sexual experiences (54% vs 32%) (all p<0.001); furthermore, avoidance was more likely to be attributed to their HIV than other factors (34% vs 19%, p=0.001). No significant correlation was observed between resilience and age, gender, sexuality or ethnicity. Thematic analysis of participants' experiences of living with HIV identified that those with low resilience most commonly reported \"social isolation\" and \"negative experiences\" whereas those with high resilience focused on \"adopting healthier behaviour\" and \"empowering experiences\". Conclusion: A resilience scale may be a non-intrusive way of assessing negative experiences of living with HIV, including stigma and discrimination, and could therefore be used as a screening tool in HIV clinics for referral to counselling, peer support and other support services.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "P141"}, {"text": "Uncharted territory: a report into the first generation growing older with HIV L Scott, D Laycock and C Blowes Terrence Higgins Trust, London, UK Background: Due to an incredible advancement in treatment over the past 30 years we are now seeing the first group of people growing older with HIV. This research explores what growing older with HIV means for people in the UK. This includes those who have been long term diagnosed and those in the growing cohort of people being diagnosed in their 50s and older. Methods: This project was designed as a peer led piece of research. We recruited 12 peer researchers all of whom were aged 50 or older and living with HIV. The peer team assisted in the design, implementation and interpretation of the research. Participants from across Great Britain were recruited to complete a comprehensive survey, take part in an in-depth interview or group workshop.

Future care was a key concern for participants. Survey respondents had on average 3 times more health conditions (in addition to HIV) than the general population of the same age and only 12% have made financial preparations for future care provision. Satisfaction with the quality of care received at HIV clinics was consistently high, although there was frustration that clinics are no longer a one-stop-shop for all health care needs. Quality of care received at GP surgeries was more variable mainly due to inconsistent knowledge around HIV. Conclusion: There is huge diversity in the experiences of this cohort spanning from the beginning of the epidemic though to very recent diagnoses. Many people will need little support as they grow older with HIV.

The workshop was structured flexibly, with core activities and additional discussion points, used depending on group dynamic and flow of discussion, so each workshop varied slightly. The key creative activity was body mapping, adapted for use as a research technique to support women to explore and share their experiences through creative means, with the intention that this facilitates greater sharing and offers an alternative to discussion, for those participants who prefer it. Results: Isolation emerged as major theme in all the workshops. Participants described loneliness and physical isolation, with a lack of social support, and family and friendship networks as well as lack of access to support services, and described fears of this increasing as they grew older. In addition, participants described the impact of physical challenges of ageing, menopause, managing HIV treatment and side effects, and stigma and discrimination associated with age and HIV separately and in combination. Disclosure and social relationships were particularly challenging. In the body mapping exercise, participants described fear and uncertainty about the future, and dependence on formal sources of support, particularly peer support. Such support was identified as key concern in the context of diminishing resources and cuts to services.

Background: Responding to the evolving climate of antiretroviral (ARV) prescribing and cost pressures, the Midlands & East of England ARV Writing Group have devised a prescribing strategy, framed around an innovative visual ARV regimen banding tool. This considers whole regimen costs per month in a clinical context, whilst remaining commercially sensitive. NHS England commissioning statements, national guidelines and tender prices were taken into account. Average banding values are; 1a = \u00a3240, 1b = \u00a3350, 2a = \u00a3445, 2b = \u00a3495, 3a = \u00a3505, 3b = \u00a3615, 4 = \u00a3870. As band costs increase, greater levels of team/MDT discussion are required. We look to ascertain the real world feasibility of this regional strategy. Methods: The new tool went live on 01/09/16, and the timeframe we observed was from 01/09/16-30/11/16. Centres submitted data captured in the regional audit form within this timeframe.

This transition prompts us to consider whether shared EPRs between GUM/HIV services and other NHS services are acceptable to our patients and staff. Methods: We conducted a 10-question paper survey of patients attending a routine HIV clinic appointment between June and September 2016. Furthermore, we conducted an electronic staff survey concurrently. Results: We received 51 patient and 50 staff responses to our surveys. A majority of patients (67%) were accepting of their GP having access to their HIV clinic notes, while just less than half (47%) agreed with a shared EPR system between GPs, GUM/HIV and other hospital services. 56% of staff surveyed felt that healthcare providers outside the GUM/HIV department should have access to these notes. Many concerns around shared EPRs stemmed from fear of stigmatisation, although confidentiality, effects on the patient-physician relationship and implications for travel were also cited. The staff responding recognised many benefits of shared EPRs as well as the potential limitations and disadvantages. Conclusion: We have shown that there is considerable acceptance for the principal of sharing EPRs between HIV and primary care services.

It is the only known mobile health (mHealth) app to support self-management strategies for people living with HIV. The app gives users the ability to set goals, achieve rewards, input health information and set calendar reminders. Methods: Between July and December 2016, usability and usefulness of BeYou+ (version1.1.1) was evaluated by; (a) expert heuristic evaluation (b) expert review against existing research publications relating to systems designed for use by people living with HIV (c) feedback from potential users (d) feedback from current users and (e) end-user evaluators who had not used or downloaded BeYou+. Feedback from users was obtained via anonymous online questionnaire, with end-user evaluation including BeYou+ screenshots and omitting questions on self-management, quality of life and well-being. Participants were recruited online via social media platforms or push notifications within BeYou+ app. One interview was conducted for more indepth understanding of perspectives. Results: Total 28 recommendations were made from expert reviews. Overall the app has good usability. The app design could be improved even more by attending to issues in structuring information, consistency and clearer labelling. Informational content is perceived as useful but the added value of having this information on a paid-for app needs clarification. Tracking lab results is appreciated and extending this to other health data eg: symptoms is suggested. Medication adherence and potential interactions is of great importance to respondents and this aspect could be improved in the app. While setting goals is important, users wanted more flexibility in the frequency of goals and how they are notified.

We report on a questionnaire administered to obtain feedback on the appropriateness and usefulness of the training from participant healthcare professionals' (HCPs). Methods: Education sessions (~1-hour) based on the MEDFASH 'HIV testing in practice' online educational tool were delivered as a stepped-wedge randomised controlled trial in 19 GP-practices with a high HIV practice population prevalence (>2/1000). Feedback on the training was via paperbased evaluation questionnaires completed immediately after the training. Mean scores for seven statements were calculated using a 4 point scale (1=strongly disagree, 2=disagree, 3=agree, 4=strongly agree). Results: Training sessions were attended by 169 HCPs of whom 93 were GPs, 53 nurses and 23 'others' (e.g. practice manager). 127 (75%) of evaluation questionnaires were completed. Mean scores were above 3 for the following statements: 'I can apply the information gained from the training in my practice setting 'and 'The trainer actively involved me in the learning process' scored the highest (mean score 3.7). Statements that participants were 'more aware of the BHIVA and NICE guidelines on HIV testing' scored the lowest (mean score 3.4). Three statements 'The training met my professional educational needs' and 'As a result of the training I feel more confident in my ability to discuss HIV testing with a patient' and 'More confident in my ability to conduct HIV testing' all received a mean score of 3.6.

Examples of free-text responses included: \"Interactive\", summarised risk factors, who to test, how to refer\" and \"Raising awareness, information about prevalence and presenting symptoms to be aware of\". When asked: Would you do anything differently in your practice setting as a result of this training?

Methods: An online survey was undertaken by 173 people living with HIV (plhiv) from across England respondents were predominantly gay men, ages ranged from 26 to 72 years old, with a median of 15 years of living with HIV. A focus group was held at Positively UK in London with 13 participants; 10 women and three men, all aged over 50. Results: Communication between GPs and HIV Clinics: In our 2010 report GPs and HIV clinicians identified communication as unsatisfactory. In 2016 75% of plhiv stated the HIV clinic communicated with their GP, but only 35% that the GP communicated with their HIV clinic. Clinical Governance: In 2010 we found \"Many patients currently do not have confidence in GP's knowledge of HIV\". In 2016 41% stated their GP was able to manage their health and 38% that the GP had a good understanding of HIV issues. Often patients did not know what was HIV related and what was not, nor 'where to draw the line' leading to confusion as to who should manage aspects of their care. Confidentiality: Today, 75% of respondents felt their information was held confidentially by their GP. This is an improvement from 2010 when perceptions and fear of confidentiality breaches were common amongst plhiv. Sexual Health: Only 45% of survey respondents perceived their GP as being comfortable talking about sexual health. This has implications as to how sexual health is managed for plhiv in primary care and also poses a greater risk for early identification, diagnosis and treatment. Models of Care: In 2010 the majority of plhiv wanted a GP situated within the HIV clinic and this was mirrored in the 2016 study, with a smaller cohort wanting to access their GP locally. However, the over-riding issue for all was one of knowledge and education of GPs. Conclusion: In the six years between studies there has been some progress in terms of how GPs support plhiv notably in managing confidentiality. However, because of poor communication and knowledge the burden is on the patient to manage their care and ensure all aspects are joined up.

We highlight some changes in the prison HIV population and describe the improvements we have made to their management. Methods: We obtained information from the prison healthcare electronic patient record (EPR) system on HIV positive prisoners seen in our service between April 2015 and December 2016. Results: Our previous experience (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) involved a relatively small heterosexual population with modest levels of IVDU. Between 2011 and 2015 patients were transported them to their previous treating centres for HIV care with some ad hoc care given by a sessional HIV physician. 40% were on ART and 70% had been seen in an HIV service in the preceding six months (generally prior to detention). 40% had some information regarding their HIV care on the prison healthcare EPR and the majority had experienced treatment interruptions. To date we have provided care to 93 HIV+ people. 4 individuals were diagnosed HIV positive whilst in prison. The majority of patients are held in the category \"B\" prison with smaller numbers in the category \"A\" prison and YOI. 37% are MSM and 29% are known to be HCV co-infected. 25 have been in prison more than once in the last 18 months. In the MSM, 65% of offending behaviour is associated with drug misuse. 74% of patients are on ART and of those 65% have an undetectable VL. 53% reported unscheduled treatment interruptions, usually around the time of coming into prison. 7 patients have refused or opted to defer treatment. We have obtained clinical summaries for 44 patients and have made this available on EPR to facilitate the care of prisoners who move within the prison system. All patients who have left prison have done so with a supply of ART and we identified services for ongoing care in the majority. Conclusion: The number of HIV positive prisoners has increased and a significant number are MSM with offending behaviour associated with drug use. The majority of patients were aware of their HIV status prior to arrival in prison. We have improved prisoner engagement with HIV care and uptake of ART and have made a number of interventions to minimise the risk of unscheduled treatment interruptions.

Late diagnosis occurs in up to 50% and has negative consequences for patients, public health and the NHS. To encourage appropriate HIV testing, a City Council commissioned an education intervention in GP-practices. This qualitative study examined healthcare professionals' (HCPs) experiences and perceived impacts of the education intervention on HIV testing. Methods: Education sessions (~1-hour) based on the MEDFASH 'HIV testing in practice' online educational tool were delivered as a stepped-wedge randomised controlled trial in 19 GP-practices with a high HIV practice population prevalence (>2/1000). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with HCPs who attended the training approximately 3-months post-training, and the sexual health clinician that delivered the training. Interviews explored pre-training HIV testing practices, factors influencing testing, views of the training, impact on knowledge, confidence and testing practices. GP-practices were reimbursed \u00a340 per interview. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. Results: 27 interviews (lasting 30 minutes on average) were conducted across 13 practices with 16 GPs, 10 nurses and the sexual health clinician. Participants appreciated the opportunity to update their HIV knowledge through a tailored, interactive session, delivered by a knowledgeable sexualhealth clinician. Post-training, HCPs increased: awareness of HIV indicator conditions; confidence/self-efficacy to offer HIV tests efficiently; and consideration of HIV tests. Whilst some felt they had increased HIV testing others did not. Continued barriers to testing include perceived lack of opportunity to test and not considering HIV during consultations. To optimise intervention impact, follow-up sessions were recommended. Discussion: The findings suggest the HIV training was experienced positively and improved perceived awareness, confidence, and consideration of HIV testing whilst perceptions of testing rates were mixed.

We identified strategies to reduce wastage, including: 1) Limiting ART supply at time of starting or switching ART to one month, 2) Limiting prescriptions outside routine clinic visits to one month, 3) Encouraging remaining ARVs to be used before non-urgent regimen switches, 4) Enhanced adherence support by community nurses in poorly adherent patients. We reaudited to assess their impact. Methods: Pharmacy records over an 18-month period were screened for: a) patients stable on one ARV regimen b) patients who had switched therapy. The electronic HIV database was also interrogated. Case notes were reviewed to determine reasons for switch and confirm overprescribing of ARVs. Pharmacy data were used to confirm amount of wastage, and corresponding cost, over a one-year period. Results: A total of 1186 patients were prescribed ARVs in 2015-16. On initial screening, 90 stable patients appeared to have had >3 months excess; on review, 4 had hepatitis B (not HIV) infection, 37 had appropriate total dispensation, and 3 had insufficient data recorded. For 46 overprescribed patients, the annual total wastage was 133 months of ARVs, at a cost of \u00a365,447. Of 334 patients screened, 166 switched therapy. Common reasons were simplification (28%), tolerability (26%) and toxicity (17%), with interactions (7%), failure (7%), and adherence (5%) less frequent. Wastage was demonstrated in 59/156 (38%; 10 cases unclear), totalling \u00a340,569. New ARVs were prescribed for >1 month on 39 occasions (23%). Quantities and costs were calculated by at least two assessors; inter-and intra-observer agreement was 100% when tested on three switch patients. Conclusion: Compared with the previous audit, excess stable ARV prescription remained similar, despite an increase in cohort size, while the wastage at switch decreased significantly. Reduction in quantity of new regimen prescribed may be responsible for reductions in wastage, following the simple clinician feedback interventions. However, significant annual wastage was still observed: \u00a3106,016.

A pilot service V Gordon and D Brawley NHS Grampian, Aberdeen, UK Background: HIV medications supplied and dispensed by community pharmacy are currently exempt from VAT. This saving is essential as HIV cohorts grow. Furthermore in services covering rural areas this can provide improved access to medications especially with newer less toxic regimes requiring less frequent review. Our service covers a large rural area including islands and cares for approximately 400 HIV positive patients. As a significant proportion of patients live in these rural areas, there are often shared care arrangements with primary care and/or tele/videoconferencing. The option of community supply and dispensing of HIV medications was seen as an opportunity to provide more localised, patient centred care. Methods: All 347 patients on treatment were surveyed with 20% opting for community pharmacy. For eligible patients community supply arrangements were put in place with all drug companies & wholesalers. Each nominated pharmacy was contacted and/or visited by HIV pharmacist and provided with a transfer pack containing ordering instructions, regimens, drug stability data, interaction resources and secondary care contact information. Hospital based prescriptions were posted to community pharmacies and the drugs were ordered and dispensed accordingly. Patients were then informed when medications were ready to collect. Results: 56 patients are currently receiving medications from community pharmacies. To date this has not affected clinic attendance or compliance and there have been no requests from patients to return to hospital dispensing. In addition the feedback from community pharmacists has been positive.

HIV-positive adults are at a 40 times higher risk of infection, with associated greater morbidity and mortality compared to aged-matched HIV-negative adults. BHIVA recommend that all HIV positive adults receive a single dose pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13) irrespective of CD4 count, anti-retroviral (ARV) use and viral load (VL), and that those aged >65 years or with other co-morbidities also receive a single dose of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV-23). Locally, these BHIVA recommendations are included in all written HIV correspondence to GPs who, at present, are the main providers of the pneumococcal vaccinations .The aim of this study is to establish current patient knowledge of the vaccination(s) and adherence to BHIVA guidelines as demonstrated by the number of patients confirmed to have been vaccinated. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study, using a questionnaire, of 50 out-patients attending HIV clinics over a one week period.

The UK Community Advisory Board (UKCAB) is a network of HIV advocates with over 800 members and 120 HIV groups and source for community representatives (CRs). Methods: 14 semi-structured interviews were conducted with multidisciplinary England based clinicians (7F/7M) on their experiences on BHIVA/ NHVNA committees, Trial Steering Groups and Scientific Advisory Boards with HIV CRs. Transcript analysis was done using primary coding of pre-set and emergent codes on clinicians experiences of CR impact. Results: Most frequent cited benefit was lived experience and whole pathway perspectives that CRs brought. Others were non-clinical, advocacy, empathy, patient centeredness, research initiation and direction, developing patient information and other dissemination strategies, community prioritisation, lobbying, studies/guidelines reality check, media management and increased learning for clinicians. All interviewees valued the contribution of CRs on committees and identified their unique impact. The UK-CAB is seen as a valuable formal resource for providing skilled CRs. Funding was the most commonly described challenge for community engagement. Some participants felt that training, mentorship, apprenticeship, induction and shadowing was valuable for all professionals and CRs joining committees. Representativeness of CRs had varied views, some were impressed at CRs ability to bring a range of views from the HIV community, others were uncertain about existing feedback systems and some concerns that viewpoints of some groups was unheard. Observation was that people newly diagnosed may have different needs from long term diagnosed. Concern was expressed about CRs selection process and provision of opportunities for newer and less experienced CRs. A number of innovative and best practice examples of community involvement were identified. Conclusion: CRs were highly valued and seen as effective/impactful by all professionals in this study with benefits to the individual, professionals, organization and the health system.

We present results from a qualitative study exploring experiences of the menopause among WLHIV in the UK. Methods: In collaboration with an HIV charity and two peer researchers, we conducted three focus group discussions (FGDs) in 2015 with 24 WLHIV aged 43-62. All FGDs were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically in NVivo 10.0. This work is part of the PRIME study, a mixed-methods observational study exploring the impact of the menopause on WLHIV's health and wellbeing Results: Women described a lack of prior knowledge, leaving them underprepared for menopausal symptoms. For women born in Sub-Saharan Africa (n=16), this was exacerbated by cultural taboos around discussing menopause, and loss of kinship networks during migration. Menopause in the context of HIV brought particular challenges. Participants were concerned that menopause could be precipitated by HIV-infection or ART, whilst some were reluctant to take further medication such as hormone replacement therapy when already on ART. Common symptoms such as hot flushes, mood changes and poor sleep, sometimes impacted on ability to adhere to ART. Many participants did not recognise their menopausal symptoms, instead attributing them to ART side-effects or HIV. Furthermore, they found themselves \"going backwards and forwards\" between primary healthcare providers (HCPs) and HIV-physicians when seeking advice and clinical care, often leading to frustrating delays. Participants highlighted the importance of supportive HCPs and accessible information on HIV and the menopause, and the need for ongoing peersupport, many describing their participation in the FGDs, often their first opportunity to discuss menopause with other WLHIV, as \"empowering\". Conclusion: This is one of the first qualitative studies to explore experiences of the menopause in WLHIV. Participants encountered particular challenges in the recognition and management of the menopause, as a result of also being HIV-positive. Increasing awareness among patients and HCPs, developing HIVspecific patient resources, and peer-support networks may help support WLHIV at this stage in their lives and limit negative impacts on their HIV care.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "STIs, Reproductive Health, Contraception and Sexual Dysfunction"}, {"text": "Do women with HIV/AIDS on antiretroviral therapy have a lower incidence of symptoms associated with menstrual dysfunction? D Hapangama 1 , N Tempest 1 and D Edirisinghe 2 1 University of Liverpool, UK, 2 Royal Liverpool University Hospital, UK Background: Symptoms associated with endometriosis and menstrual disorders are common amongst women of reproductive ages, the pathogenesis of these illnesses is postulated to be due to aberrations in endometrial regeneration, immune response and endometrial stem cells. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been shown to enhance events seen in biological aging of tissues, with illnesses associated with stemcell aging appearing prematurely in HIV/AIDS patients. The specific component of HAART that causes features resembling ageing are thought to be nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) which have anti-telomerase activity. We have recently shown that high telomerase activity is a feature of endometrial epithelial progenitor cells and endometriosis. Aim: Examine if women on HAART have a lower incidence of symptoms associated with menstrual irregularities or endometriosis. Methods: 100 HIV positive women (group 1) attending the specialist HIV clinic at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital were consented, completed a questionnaire and the attending doctor recorded the patients HIV related history including recent blood test results. 75 non HIV positive patients (group2) were used as controls. Results: Women in group1 were slightly older (38 vs. 33 years, p<0.01); with higher BMI (29 vs. 25, p<0.01); likely to be parous (85% vs. 47% <0.01) and non-Caucasian (84% vs 21%, p<0.01), compared with group2. Mean duration of diagnosis of HIV was 8 years with 4 patients diagnosed with AIDs. Most (82%) of group1 had a CD4 count of > 400, a viral load of < 50 (93%) and a median duration of HAART of 6 years. A similar proportion of women from both groups did not use contraceptives (30% vs 28%) and more women in group1 used condoms (41% vs 24%). Women reported light or normal flow (56% vs 50%) and shorter duration (<7 days) of bleeding more commonly in group1 compared with controls (90% vs 80%). Women in group1 were less likely to rate menstrual pain as moderate to severe compared with controls (39% vs 42%). Conclusion: Our data suggests that women with HIV on NRTIs have decreased incidence of menstrual flow, duration and pain, supporting our hypothesis, possibly due to the (beneficial) side effects of NRTIs on endometrial telomerase activity.

We plan to increase patients' awareness of the SRH services and conduct qualitative research to determine why women do not avail of the full SRH service currently offered. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is beneficial to HIV positive women who are symptomatic and/or with early menopause and may improve bone health. At our centre 40% of HIV positive patients are female and 625 (63%) are aged >45 years. Postmenopausal women may be referred to an HIV medical gynaecology clinic for review and HRT counselling. Aim: To assess the uptake of HRT in HIV positive postmenopausal women, the effectiveness of HRT in treating menopausal symptoms and demographic and HIV characteristics of those with early, premature or natural menopause. Methods: Retrospective case note review of post-menopausal women with HIV attending the medical gynaecology clinic between 1st Jan 2011-31st Dec 2016. Menopause was classified by age at menopause as premature (<40 years), early (40-45 years) or natural (>45) and baseline characteristics and management described. Results: Of the 579 women referred to medical gynaecology, 73 (12%) were postmenopausal (88% black ethnicity, 95% undetectable on treatment, median (IQR) current and nadir CD4 630 (435,780) and 259 (111,396) cells/ll respectively) The age range at menopause was between 36-53 years; 11 (15%) had premature and 15 (21%) early menopause. There was no evidence of a difference between demographic/HIV characteristics between menopause categories (P<0.5 for all). There was a trend to higher parity among those with natural menopause compared to early or premature (median IQR) parity 2 (1,2) vs. 1 (0,2) and 1 (0,1) respectively, p=0.02). 69 women attended; 49 (71%) to discuss menopause management and symptom control, of which 28 (57%) accepted HRT. 23 (82%) were prescribed systemic HRT; 19 (83%) had continuous or sequential oestrogen patch or gel plus micronized progestogen. 11 (58%) required oestrogen up-titration to improve symptoms. 4 experienced side effects (bleeding N=3, mood disturbance N=1). All women had symptomatic relief within 6 months of starting HRT; 4 discontinued due to side effects and anxiety about breast cancer. 24 underwent bone mineral density evaluation, 15 (62.5%) were osteopenic and 2 (8%) had osteoporosis. Conclusion: HRT was acceptable to the majority of women with HIV who were counselled and offered treatment. All women had symptomatic improvement and adverse effects were rare.

Asymptomatic patients who are at high risk of STIs will therefore not be routinely tested. The aim of the study was to establish the prevalence of asymptomatic chlamydia (CT) and gonorrhea (NG) in key populations at increased risk of acquisition or transmission of HIV, and the risk factors for STIs. Materials and Methods: The study was carried out at the Infectious Disease Institute, Mulago Hospital Kampala from March-July 2015. Asymptomatic patients in the following categories were offered STI testing: HIV discordant couples; HIV young adults; HIV pregnant patients and those attending the 'most at risk population clinic'.

Changes to our HARS database are being implemented to aid documentation of sexual health history and screening. Uptake of annual cytology has decreased. Since the result of the audit an IT aide-m emoire has been created reminding clinicians to address overdue smears with patients.

Preliminary findings from the MAIL Study Methods: Qualitative interviews were conducted with 25 HIV-positive MSM across four HIV outpatient clinics. Men were aged 20-45 (mean=33.5), all but two self-identified as gay, and none had children. As part of the interview, patients were asked whether they wanted to become parents in the future, whether they had ever talked about parenthood possibilities with their clinicians, and whether they thought parenthood and the reproductive health should be discussed as part of HIV care. Results: Of the 25 MSM, 11 expressed some parenting desire. Only four patients recalled talking about parenthood possibilities with healthcare practitioners. In each case, the men had been briefly reassured at the time of HIV diagnosis that it was possible for HIV-positive people to become parents, which they saw as both significant and sufficient information. Most men said that they would like, or would have liked, to discuss issues related to parenthood in the context of HIV or to be directed to relevant information sources. In a minority of cases, living with HIV seemed to have a direct impact on the men's parenting intentions. The most frequently given suggestion was to highlight that parenthood was a possibility at the time of HIV diagnosis, with signposting to information sources for those potentially interested. Most men said that they would feel comfortable asking clinic staff about parenthood possibilities, especially if they had specific questions about implications of HIV for biological parenthood. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that a significant number of HIV-positive MSM would like to have children in the future and that the time of HIV diagnosis is especially crucial for the reassurance that it is possible for people living with HIV to become parents. More detailed and reliable information should be available to clinicians so that they are able to direct patients to relevant resources if needed.

It has been shown to supress transgene expression by recruiting the histone lysine methyltransferase SETDB1 leading to the deposition of repressive chromatin marks. The role of HUSH in HIV latency has not been defined. We have studied whether knock down of HUSH proteins causes reactivation from latency in a model system and whether this potentiates the action of anti-latency agents. We have also studied how HUSH protein levels respond to incoming virus We utilised 6 clones of an established model of HIV latency (J-Lat) which express green fluorescent protein (GFP) on activation of the HIV LTR. Using shRNA expressing vectors we knocked down the components of HUSH and evaluated for an increase in GFP expression by flow cytometry. To explore whether disruption of the HUSH complex would synergise with known activators of HIV latency shRNA transduced J-Lat cells were treated with either the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat or the bromodomain inhibitor JQ1. To examine whether the levels of HUSH components change in response to HIV infection Jurkat cells were transduced with a pseudotyped near full length HIV. Protein was harvested 72 hours after infection and expression levels assessed by Western blot. No consistent pattern of activation was seen in any of the J-Lat clones evaluated. Some of the levels of activation reached statistical significance Our results demonstrate that disruption of the HUSH complex by is insufficient to cause a biologically significant activation of latent HIV and that HUSH knock down does not potentiate the actions of other latency reversing agents. Therefore HUSH is not likely to be a useful target for future therapies aimed at flushing out the latent reservoir. The fall in the level of MPP8 and TASOR upon HIV infection raises the possibility the HIV has evolved a mechanism to oppose silencing by HUSH.

However there is no consensus on optimal interventions to decrease chemsex prevalence or the risks associated with chemsex in HIV positive and HIV negative men who have sex with men. Method: We conducted a systematic review of biomedical and behavioural interventions for chemsex. Bibliographic databases and trial registers were searched for randomised, non-randomised and observational English language studies published between July 2006-2016. Outcomes included prevalence of chemsex, unprotected anal intercourse during chemsex and incidences of HIV, Hepatitis C and bacterial sexually transmitted infections Results: Of 6967 papers identified, five met the inclusion criteria, including two randomised control trials. Four studies demonstrated a reduction in chemsex prevalence; the remaining study did not have any episodes of chemsex reported at baseline or follow up. Only one study described small reductions in risky insertive and receptive anal sex while using chemsex drugs. No studies investigated biological outcomes. Conclusion: This review was unable to establish an optimal biomedical intervention for chemsex, due to the limited number of studies, their heterogeneity and reduced internal and external validity. Further work is needed to develop and assess biomedical interventions that may result in decreased prevalence and/or risks associated with chemsex.P30Highly invisible, highly infectious and high risk: the hidden problem of trans* people living with HIV T Suchak 1 , S Patel 1 , R Byrne 1 , M Ross 2 and A Wolton 2 1 Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London, UK, 2 CliniQ CIC, London, UK Background: The number of trans* people living with HIV (tplwHIV) in the UK is unknown; as is the overall number of trans* identified people. In 2013, a meta-analysis reported that the estimated HIV prevalence among transgender women was 19.1% worldwide although the UK was not included, likely due to paucity of information in the UK. Studies in the USA and Canada indicate that trans* people experience multiple barriers to healthcare resulting in late diagnosis of HIV and lower rates of virological suppression than cisgender people. We are seeing increasing numbers of trans* people living with HIV presenting to our service and believe they are affected by the same issues. Method: Trans* individuals attending for care were identified by their treatment team at 3 central London GUM clinics up to January 2017 and added to a database. A retrospective case note review was undertaken in order to collate demographic information, clinical data and additional risk behaviours. Results: 32 trans* people were identified as HIV positive, all trans* female. Data on trans* identities is often not recorded, Additionally trans* people face significant barriers to all aspects of healthcare including access to HIV testing, treatment and care. Trans* women specifically are a high risk group for HIV acquisition. Poor rates of viral suppression and poor adherence to treatment in addition to high risk behaviours pose a risk for onward transmission of HIV between trans* people and their partners.Awareness of PEP and PrEP is generally poor. With outreach programmes incorporating HIV testing and education we are addressing this issue. To improve outcomes for trans* PLWHIV, health services must take an intersectional, trans*-competent approach to the care continuum and be able to manage multiple risk factors. Genetic diversity within each pair of sequences, A and B, was used to infer transmission direction. The number of homogeneous nucleotide positions in sequence B that were present in nucleotide mixtures at the corresponding positions in sequence A, was divided by the number of homogeneous positions in A present in mixtures in B. This ratio was log transformed so a positive value was considered consistent with direct transmission from A to B, a negative value B to A, and values close to 0 were not suggestive of recent direct transmission. Results: In 3 of the positive control pairs the direction inferred by WGS was consistent with the known direction. The direction could not be ascertained in pair 4 due to a weak molecular signal, which may have decayed over time. Five possible transmission pairs were identified from the 170 cohort individuals. The WGS-inferred direction was consistent with the clinical data soon after transmission (pairs 5 and 6). The lack of signal in pairs 7 and 8 did not support direct transmission and suggests missing links, which may be revealed by increasing the sampling density. In pair 9, A was sampled during acute infection, several years before possible transmission to B, which may confound this method. Conclusion: WGS may improve our understanding of the factors associated with transmission by indicating the direction of recent transmissions, which could inform public health strategies. Such methods require cautious interpretation in conjunction with clinical data. Medicine \u00aa 2017 British HIV Association, HIV Medicine, 18 (Suppl.

TDF/FTC as PrEP reduced HIV incidence by 86% in the PROUD and IPERGAY trials. HIV diagnoses have fallen by 40% at this London GUM clinic from 2015 to 2016, in parallel with generic PrEP becoming available. However, concerns remain about the quality of generic PrEP and the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STI). In February 2016, we established a monitoring service for people buying generic PrEP online to test regularly for HIV, hepatitis B/C and STIs and to monitor renal function and antiretroviral drug concentrations. Methods: HIV-negative individuals attending from February-November 2016 who reported purchasing generic PrEP online were given risk reduction advice and evaluated for HIV, hepatitis B and C, renal function and STIs (gonorrhoea, chlamydia and syphilis) at first visit and offered 3-monthly follow-up. Plasma Therapeutic Drug Monitoring for TFV and FTC was also offered. Drug concentrations were measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with UV detection, with a linear range of 25-10,000 ng/mL. Results: Median time on PrEP in 398 individuals was 8 months (total 243 patient-years of follow up): >99% were Male, 88% were White, 87.5% took PrEP daily and 12.5% event-driven; 97% (253/261) were on generic TDF/FTC from Cipla Ltd. Adequate drug levels were seen in 94% of patients; drug concentrations were adequate in all repeat samples. Baseline eGFR (>60 ml/min) and/or urinalysis was normal in 99% (318/320) of individuals. Renal function deteriorated in 2% (3/150) individuals seen at follow-up; 42% of patients (112/265) reported using \"chems\" in the 12 months before starting PrEP, and 25% (67/268) reported this whilst taking PrEP. During follow-up on PrEP, 36% of patients were diagnosed with an STI. In 243 person-years of follow up, there were no cases of HIV infection (0%, 95% C.I.: 0 -1.5%). There were no new cases of hepatitis B and one new case of hepatitis C. Conclusion: Despite 36% being diagnosed with an STI, there were no new cases of HIV in 398 individuals on PrEP for median 8 months. Concentrations of TFV and FTC were similar to those in individuals on branded Truvada from Gilead. Strategies to reduce STIs remain crucial. Reference: 1.

CT coronary calcium scoring assesses the degree of stable, calcified atherosclerotic plaque in the coronary arteries. Coronary calcium (CorCa) scores can help clinicians to risk-stratify patients and influence primary prevention strategies. The AHA advises that patients with CorCa scores >100 should be considered for statin therapy, aspirin and possibly ACE-I. The aim of this study was to assess the burden of CVD in HIV positive patients, by an analysis of the rate of increase of CorCa scores after a five year interval. Particular interest was in the effect of ARV's on the rate of acceleration. Method: 1976 individual CorCa scores for HIV positive patients were recorded on PACS from 2007 to 2016. Of these, 47 patients had readings five years apart. Data on smoking status, cholesterol levels, triglyceride levels, diabetes status, statin therapy and ARV regimen were acquired from medical records. A multi-variate analysis was carried out on the data. Key results: CorCa scores ranged from 0 to 916 Agatstons. Twenty two patients had a coronary calcium score of zero at year 1 with 16 (73%) retaining a score of zero at year 5. Twenty-nine patients had an increase in their CorCa scores with the largest increase being 454 Agatstons. Using the Rumberger model, 20 patients at year 1 and 29 patients at year 5 were identified as having moderate to extensive atherosclerotic disease. Twentythree of these patients were taking a statin. Multi-variate analysis showed strong evidence that the baseline CorCa score was the single most important predictor of the 5-year CorCa score. No evidence was found of a significant association between a specific ARV or pair of treatments, and increased CorCa score, although the analysis was limited by the large number of ARV drugs and combinations combined with the small sample size. For patients on statin therapy, a unit increase in baseline value corresponded to an increase in 5year value of 1.86. There was no evidence of a significant effect of smoking status on CorCa increase. Conclusion: Although the dataset is small, typical members of this HIV positive population seem to be at significant risk of increases in coronary calcium and therefore of CVD. Baseline CorCa score was the greatest predictor of 5 year CorCa score among these 47 HIV positive patients. ARV choice does not appear to affect the rate of increase of CorCa score.

In this case, it occurred at the time of an abdominal infection which may have been the trigger; similar to a case of CD8 + transverse myelitis following Shigella gastroenteritis.P66Characteristics of HIV-associated lung cancer and the use of novel receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors A Samani, A Dalla Pria, J Norton, P Gallagher, J Froggatt, TN Davis and M Bower National Centre for HIV Malignancy, London, UK Background: HIV-associated lung cancer is a common non-AIDS-defining malignancy that clinicians are likely to encounter with increasing frequency in people living with HIV (PLWH). The introduction of receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have shown benefit in non-small cell lung cancer harboring these mutations. Method: A retrospective analysis was performed of prospectively collected data on all patients with lung cancer referred to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital between 1993 and 2016. The management and outcome of PLWH with EGFR mutant lung cancers were further studied. Results: 286 patients with lung cancer were identified including 51 PLWH. The mean age at lung cancer diagnosis was lower in PLWH (mean 53 vs. 67 years, p<0.001) and more were male (88% vs. 63%, p<0.001). There were no differences in tumour stage at diagnosis or histological subtypes. At lung cancer diagnosis the mean CD4 cell count was 413/mm 3 , 76% had an undetectable HIV viral load and the mean interval since HIV diagnosis was 11.8 years. Since routine EGFR mutation testing became available in 2009, 3/ 10 eligible HIV+ patients had tumours with an EGFR mutation (one exon 21 L858R mutation, two exon 19 deletions). All three received first-line RTKI (2 erlotinib, 1 gefitinib) and 2 had objective responses of 26 and 33 months with the third as yet not assessed. Both patients who progressed on 1 st line EGFR TKIs demonstrated de novo T790M mutation at repeat biopsy. Of these, one was eligible for osimertinib, resulting in a second partial response (treatment ongoing at 6 months). Conclusions: Except for age and gender, baseline characteristics appear similar between patients with and without HIV infection. In most patients, HIV infection is well controlled at presentation, with undetectable viral loads. Within the limits of a small sample size, EGFR mutations appear to occur at a similar frequency to the non-HIV population and there appear to be similar clinical responses and resistance mechanisms to EGFR TKIs. Clinicians need to be vigilant regarding potential drug interactions with protease inhibitor antiretrovirals and the first generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).P67Characteristics of people living with HIV infection accessing mental health services in South LondonBackground: The prevalence of HIV among people living with serious mental illness (SMI) is higher than in the general population. HIV is associated with high rates of depression. South London has a high prevalence of SMI and HIV. CASCAID was a specialist community mental health (MH) service for people with HIV. It operated from 1993 to 2016 as part of the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM) which provides mental MH services for people living in Lambeth, Southwark, Croydon and Lewisham. Aim: Compare the characteristics of people with HIV accessing CASCAID to those accessing general secondary and tertiary MH services (non-CASCAID). Method: Retrospective cohort study of data obtained from the SLaM Biomedical Research Centre Case Register using the Clinical Record Interactive Search Application (CRIS). CRIS provides researchers access to anonymised information extracted from over 250,000 SLaM electronic clinical records using natural language processing to extract structured data from open-text fields. The TextHunter software programme was used to develop 'apps' for HIV and HIV treatment to identify HIV positive patients within the case register. Both 'apps' had good rates of exactness and completeness in relation to identifying patients with HIV and/or taking HIV treatment. The CASCAID cohort was identified by 'team episode'. The study period was 2007-15. Chi squared tests were used to compare distributions between CASCAID and non CASCAID users and logistic and linear regression was used to examine associations between MH outcome and user group. Results: 5573 people with HIV accessed MH services during the study period. Sociodemographic factors were strongly associated with whether patients accessed CASCAID or non CASCAID MH services. Compared to those with SMI, patients with other diagnostic MH groups were likely to access CASCAID.P68CSF inflammatory markers after adding maraviroc to MONotherapy darunavir/ritonavir: the CINAMMON Study T Barber 1 , M Boffito 1 , A Pozniak 1 , N Davies 1 , S Mandalia 1 , B Gazzard 1 , J Niubo 2 , R Fortuny 2 , D Podzamczer 2 and A Imaz Vacas 2 1 Chelsea and Westminster NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK, 2 Bellvitge University Hospital, Barcelona, Spain Background: Alternative ART strategies such as protease inhibitor monotherapy have raised concerns about CNS penetration. CINAMMON is a phase IV, open-label, single-arm, pilot study to assess the role of maraviroc (MVC) addition to darunavir/ritonavir monotherapy (mono-DRV/r) in virologically suppressed patients. Methods: Subjects on mono-DRV/r with VL<40 in London and Barcelona were recruited if showing a CCR5 tropic results and remained on mono-DRV/r for 12w before adding MVC. Lumbar puncture (LP) and neurocognitive (NC) function (Cogstate) examinations were performed at baseline, w12 and following 24w of MVC (w36). CSF and plasma DRV/r concentrations were measured at w12 and w36, and MVC at w36. The primary study endpoint was week (w) 12 to w36 CSF inflammatory markers changes (neopterin, S100b, neurofilament heavy chain (NFH), CSF ferritin) following MVC 150 mg qd addition to mono-DRV/r 800/100 mg qd for 24w. Secondary endpoints included changes in neurocognitive function (Cogstate), and CSF drug levels, following addition of MVC. Results: Nineteen patients were recruited and 15 completed the study (17M, 2F). Drop outs were for headache (2), knee problem meaning could not attend (1), and personal reasons (1). Mean age (range) was 45.4 years (27.2-65.1), 13/19 were white and 10/19 MSM. No changes in S100b, NfH, CSF ferritin, neopterin were seen between w12 and w36. Overall NC function improved between w12 and w36 following MVC addition: total age adjusted z score improved by 0.27 (weighted paired t-test; p=0.11). Looking at tests for executive function only, in this group age adjusted z score improved by 0.54 (weighted paired t-test; p=0.03). This compared to tests for other (nonexecutive) cognitive function where the age adjusted z score showed no significant change between w12 and w36 (weighted paired t-test; p=0.25). Darunavir plasma:CSF concentration ratio did not change between w12 (132) and w36 (112; p=0.577, Wilcoxon signed rank). Maraviroc plasma:CSF concentration ratio was 35 at w36. Conclusions: No change in neuroinflammatory markers were observed. Whilst a learning effect cannot be entirely excluded, in this small study the addition of 24 weeks of MVC 150 mg to stable DRV/r monotherapy showed a tendency to improvement in overall NC function overall at w36, and a significant improvement in executive function. The mechanism of this improvement should be further evaluated.\u00aa 2017 The Authors HIV Medicine \u00aa 2017 British HIV Association, HIV Medicine, 18 (Suppl.

We examined the outcomes of individuals diagnosed at a central London clinic in 2015 for fulfilment of these goals. Methods: Case-note review of all new HIV diagnoses at a central London clinic between 1st May and 30th September 2015 followed up to 31st December 2016. Results: There were 214 new HIV diagnoses: 97% (207/214) male, all were men who have sex with (MSM). Median age was 30 years. 93% (200/214) attended the first medical appointment with a doctor after a median 16 days (IQR 14-21 days) following HIV diagnosis. 88% (189/214) subsequently started anti-retroviral therapy (ART) in a median 26 days (IQR 16-55 days) following diagnosis. Up to 31st December 2016, 85% (182/214) had achieved viral load <200 copies/mL after a median 93 days (IQR 56-157 days) following HIV diagnosis. Of those who attended medical follow-up following HIV diagnosis, 95% (189/ 200) started ART. Following ART initiation, 5 transferred their HIV care elsewhere and we have no further information; up to 31st December 2016, 99% (182/184) of those on ART who are in follow-up have achieved viral load <200 copies/mL. Conclusion: At our service, most of those newly diagnosed with HIV who initiate ART do so within 4 weeks of HIV diagnosis. Despite this central London clinic's highly transient population, we have achieved the UNAIDS goals for those starting ART and reaching viral suppression.

Several HIV services in England opted for \"CQUIN\" (Commissioning for Quality and Innovation) goals incentivising cost-driven switches. The CQUIN recommends changing drug formulations or converting from branded to generic drugs. Our service reviewed additional cost saving solutions including a review of all prescribing of Etravirine (ETR). ETR is a NNRTI used particularly in patients with drug resistance and, for a period of time, used as a first line switch option at some centres for patients with side effects on other NNRTIs. As drug options and costs have evolved other regimens may now be more appropriate, both for convenience and cost. Our quality improvement project aimed to measure savings made by encouraging clinicians to switch patients from ETR to alternatives, where appropriate. Method: All patients receiving ETR in our service June 2015-April 2016 were identified from pharmacy records. Notes were reviewed to estimate the largest potential saving from viable switch options. Annual savings were calculated based on April 2016 drug prices (inc. tax) in North London. A file note was made advising the clinician to consider switching ETR to an alternative drug including discussion of options at our multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting if appropriate. If there was any known or suspected HIV resistance, MDT referral was mandatory.Table 1Reasons for not swapping off ETR affer 6 months 24 of 44 patients (54.5%) did not swap off ETR 1 Deemed unable to swap on initial notes review 2 Not seen in 6 month period 3 MDT discussion deems swapping ETR inappropriate 2 ETR kept for other pragmatic reasons on discussion with patient 5 patient declines swap 9 Pending re-discussion with patient or a planned future change 2 Swapped off Etravirine but had side effects so put back on ETR Results: At baseline, 46 patients were taking ETR. Where HIV resistance information was available individuals on ETR demonstrated resistance to a median 2.4 drug classes. Initial review suggested that only one patient unquestionably needed ETR in their regimen. Most cases required further information or an MDT review to determine whether a cost saving switch was appropriate. Had all individuals been switched from ETR to alternatives recommended by the project leads mean savings of \u00a31655.17 per patient p.a. or \u00a376,138 p.a. across the service would have been realised. 20/46 had stopped (2 pts) or switched from (18 pts) ETR at six months, 12 after MDT discussion. Reasons for remaining on ETR are outlined inTable 1. 23 patients were discussed at MDT. Viral suppression was maintained in all bar one individual with transient viraemia of 680 cp/ml at day 13; HIV-RNA was undetectable at week 4. Two patients ran out of their new medications and experienced viral rebound but did not report tolerability problems with their new regimens. The mean costs saved per patient across the whole group was \u00a3862 p.a. and the overall costs saved was \u00a337,969 p.a. Conclusion: This project demonstrated that targeted review of individuals on ETR yielded significant cost savings, despite small numbers and 54.5% remaining on ETR. The fact that more than half of individuals remained on ETR after 6 months was driven mainly by reasons other than clear clinical indication.P154Growing research in an HIV clinic: the patient perspectiveS Kegg and J King Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust, London, UK Background: Clinical research is core NHS business and can be delivered in most healthcare settings.
