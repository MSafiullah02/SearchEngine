The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has evolved into a worldwide crisis and was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020 [1]. The rate of spread, range of clinical manifestations, morbidity, and mortality associated with COVID-19 has prompted special interest in understanding the factors that predispose individuals to infection and severe forms of the disease. Many of the early studies from China overlapped in finding that, in addition to older age, certain chronic medical conditions including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, are a risk factor for severe illness with COVID-19 [2-5]. Of note, according to a recent study, diverse haplotypes of SARS-CoV-2 were identified in distinct areas, probably due to different sources of exposure [6]. However, no evidence exists whether these haplotypes are responsible for differences in clinical manifestations of the disease.",

In comparison, the percentage of infected individuals in the general population was 0.8%, which remained stable over the course of 20 days. It should be noted that children under ten years of age and females had a lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to adolescents or adults and males, respectively [6].

Subsequent analysis identified the novel betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, the seventh member of the coronavirus family that infects humans and includes severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), as the causative agent of COVID-19 [10] . An early single-center observational study in Wuhan of individuals with severe COVID-19 pneumonia described a high prevalence of chronic illness and a 22% prevalence of type 2 diabetes in individuals who did not survive the infection [2] . Another early large observational study identified type 2 diabetes as a common underlying condition in patients with severe illness (16.2%), second only to hypertension (23.7%) [3] . A meta-analysis that included these and other studies found that the incidence of diabetes was two-fold higher in those that developed severe disease compared with patients that experienced non-severe disease [5] . Subsequent studies have demonstrated an association between diabetes and poor prognosis and increased mortality. A recent retrospective cohort study of 174 patients admitted to Wuhan Union Hospital with COVID-19 found that 21.2% of patients had diabetes, and further identified diabetes as a risk factor for severe disease based on radiographic findings and biomarkers of inflammation and end-organ damage [11] .",

An envelope surrounds this helical structure and is associated with three structural proteins: membrane protein (M) and envelope protein (E), which are both involved in virion assembly, and spike protein (S), which mediates entry into host cells [20, 21] . The S protein is further characterized by a receptor-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f binding domain (RBD) S1 subunit that facilitates binding to the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and an S2 subunit that is responsible for membrane fusion [22] [23] [24] . The RBD of MERS-CoV attaches to host cells via dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) rather than ACE2 [25] . A recent study demonstrated that certain structural changes of the RBD unique to SARS-CoV-2 results in enhanced ACE2 receptor binding affinity in comparison to SARS-CoV [26] . Host cell factors further mediate viral entry through two serine proteases, TMPRSS2 and furin, which activate the S protein for membrane fusion through cleavage and assist in viral processing, respectively [21 22, 24] .",

The innate immune response involves the recognition of viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns by pattern recognition receptors (i.e., Toll-like receptors), resulting in the expression of type I interferons and inflammatory factors that potentiate macrophage and natural killer cell defense mechanisms [20] . Dendritic cells are tissue phagocytes that bridge the innate and adaptive immune response by activating Tlymphocytes and B-lymphocytes through antigen-presentation [20] . The adaptive immune system is essential for control of the persistent phase of infection and involves the production of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to viral envelope glycoproteins by CD4+ T cells and the killing of viral-infected cells by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells [20] . In the acute phase of infection, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 invade CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes resulting in apoptosis and lymphocytopenia, a marker that is associated with severe outcomes [22, 27] .",

One recent study involving patients admitted for COVID-19 suggested that hypertension and diabetes resulted in delayed clearance of SARS-CoV-2 [36] . (DPP4 H/M ), the cellular binding site for MERS-CoV, and induced diabetes through a high-fat diet [37] . The diabetic DPP4 H/M mice developed more severe disease and were found to have a dysregulated immune response after infection characterized by delayed and decreased recruitment of CD4+ T cells and inflammatory monocytes and macrophages in lung tissue. In addition to the decreased overall CD4+ T cell response, infected diabetic mice also displayed a more prominent Th17 response with increased levels of IL-17a, indicating that an alteration in cytokine profiles could be partly responsible for disease severity. This study is consistent with prior evidence that diabetes results in a shift toward Th17 responses and diminished regulatory T cells resulting in exaggerated inflammatory cascades [22, 34] . Notably, some patients infected with COVID-19 have developed a fatal hyperinflammatory syndrome resembling secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, thought to be mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 [9, 38] .",

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) signaling pathway comprises both angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE), which metabolizes angiotensin I (Ang I) to angiotensin II (Ang II), and ACE2, which converts Ang II to angiotensin (1-7) (Ang 1-7) [39] . Ang II has both vasoconstrictive and inflammatory properties, which are counter-balanced by the vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory properties of Ang 1-7 [39, 40] . The ratio of the activity of ACE and ACE2, which are both highly expressed in the lung, has been shown to have implications on lung oxygenation and lung injury in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [39, 41, 42] .",

However, it has been argued that the presence of diabetes may not predispose to an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but rather a rapid progression and worse outcome of COVID-19 [16] . Thus, appropriately controlled large studies in both the inpatient and outpatient settings are needed to quantify the magnitude of these associations before and after therapy, and to assess whether such associations are causal or due to underlying confounding. For example, studies suggesting increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in individuals with diabetes could be confounded by a greater degree of testing in this population due to more frequent visits to the emergency department or hospitalizations for coexisting complications of diabetes such as other components of the metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease.

Furthermore, the first antibody-based tests for diagnosing recent infection (IgM) or more remote infection (IgG), and possibly immunity, are only now emerging. Initial antibody-based tests, mainly enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), were characterized by a lack of specificity due to crossreactivity with other coronaviruses. These deficiencies need to be corrected for the tests to be clinically useful, and their availability needs to significantly increase since they are not currently available for screening the asymptomatic population.",

Serological testing could provide necessary read-outs regarding the efficacy of vaccines or other medications currently in clinical trials. It will also be an essential part of assessing who among the general population could be allowed to return to work safely and thus will inform public policy decisions regarding easing restrictions and re-opening the workforce [51] . Taking all the above into account, more accurate and widely available diagnostic tools are needed to expand the study sample and Due to the fact that ACE2 is the cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2, many investigators have expressed concern whether patients treated with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs), or other drugs that increase ACE2 expression may exhibit a worse prognosis and have questioned whether physicians should discontinue these drugs in patients that take them for hypertension or complications of diabetes [52, 53] . On the other hand, some evidence emphasizes the protective effects of ACE2 on the cardiovascular system and in ARDS [39, 42] . SARS-CoV-2-induced impaired ACE2 activity may hypothetically attenuate the cardioprotective role of ACE2, exaggerate inflammation, and contribute to severe lung injury in COVID-19. As discussed above, ACE2 in humans is not well understood, but evidence suggesting that ACE2 expression may be reduced in the elderly, or individuals with hypertension or diabetes, provides an argument for the continuation of ACEIs/ARBs and for clinical trials investigating the therapeutic effects of initiating these medications in severe cases of COVID-19 [40] . Furthermore, different RAAS inhibitors may demonstrate different effects on ACE2 levels and COVID-19 outcomes, and the discontinuation of ACEIs and ARBs may result in adverse health outcomes related to poor control of chronic conditions [54] [55] [56] [57] . This is an area of active investigation from both an epidemiological risk factor perspective as well as from a novel drug development point of view.",

With global attention focused on the COVID-19 pandemic and urgent requests for emergency access to potential therapies, there is an understandable temptation to use drugs without fully proven safety and efficacy against the disease. As a result, a greater emphasis on the drug-evaluation process and evidence-based decision making is needed to protect patients not only from possibly ineffective drugs but also potentially unsafe treatments, which may induce complications and have side effects [62] .Trials with long-term follow up are essential to evaluate the effects of different therapeutic strategies on patient-centered outcomes such as intermediateterm and long-term mortality. Studies should also be designed to examine the long-term cardiometabolic sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection among individuals that have recovered from COVID-19. Of note, one small study evaluated 25 individuals 12 years after recovery from SARS-CoV infection and found a higher amount of altered glucose and lipid metabolism and significant differences in serum metabolomes compared to age-matched healthy controls [63] .",

Corticosteroids may attenuate pulmonary J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f inflammation and subsequent acute lung injury by reducing the inflammatory response and modulating the activity of the immune system [76] . However, concerns exist whether corticosteroid use is associated with viral rebound, prolonged replication, and increased rates of mechanical ventilation and mortality [77] [78] [79] . Therefore, according to the WHO, corticosteroid treatment is not routinely recommended as a therapeutic option for COVID-19 pneumonia outside of clinical trials [80] .",

            "text": "At this point, we would also like to note that based on the currently proposed mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, APN01, a recombinant soluble human ACE2 (rhACE2), recently received regulatory approvals to be studied in the context of a Phase II clinical trial to treat patients with severe COVID-19. APN01 alleviates the detrimental effects of acute inflammation in the lungs and may exhibit a protective role against acute lung injury and ARDS induced by SARS-CoV-2. Due to the similarity of APN01 with human ACE2, the virus binds to the soluble APN01 and inhibits entry into human cells by serving as a decoy receptor [81] . In our opinion, and based on mechanisms of action, we believe that this is the most promising compound among all medications currently in development. In this context, it should also be noted that the activity of TMPRSS2, a molecule downstream of ACE2, is essential for viral entry into primary target cells in addition to viral spread and pathogenesis in the infected host. According to recent data, camostat mesylate, a transmembrane serine protease serine 2 inhibitor developed for the treatment of acute pancreatitis, is active against TMPRSS2 and prevents cellular entry of the virus [24] . Data regarding additional drugs of this class, such as nafamostat, are also expected in the near future from planned trials [82] . The above drugs are promising therapeutic agents, and further data are urgently needed as no specific treatment for COVID-19 is currently approved.",

Fast, efficient, but also unbiased, reliable, and valid studies are of paramount importance to provide evidence-based information and guidance to these unanswered questions. At the same time, close monitoring of the data is crucial to identify the best strategies in terms of prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment of this globally challenging health problem. Given that several viruses of increasing infectivity, virulence, and lethality have emerged over the past three decades from hot spots around the world, coordinated public health efforts centered on preventing the transmission of zoonotic diseases to humans as well as early detection of potential threats are needed to avoid similar J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f future outbreaks. Ultimately, nations and international organizations, including the WHO, will need to come together as a community to prioritize these global preparedness initiatives to ensure that an event like this does not occur again. It is never too early to start building the foundations to more effectively prevent and address future threats as we are fighting this evolving and dangerous pandemic.",
