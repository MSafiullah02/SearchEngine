Many new strategies for discovery and development of vaccines are employed in modern times, e.g., viral deletion mutants, replicating vectors, DNA-plasmids, and the use of improved adjuvants. However, several deadly diseases are still not covered by vaccines, e.g., HIV, where clinical trials fail because humans do not develop neutralizing antibodies except after long exposure to the virus or antigen. The impact of vaccination on human and animal health is hard to exaggerate and compares to the health improvements due to clean water.",

The challenges inherent to translation from the laboratory to clinical trials during the development of any vaccine include the complexity of the manufacturing process and analytical methods in the early phase, and the clinical assay optimization and running of large clinical trials in the later phases.

Complementarity means that people who are not too alike and who challenge each other must be brought together, for example by mixing academics, industry, and biotech people and having a manager to direct the team. In mutual benefit, the synergies must be used but without duplicating efforts. In international development projects it is essential to involve the countries/people that are the key stakeholders.

The current economic model creates the lack of availability of medicines to poor children due to the lack of income for the private industry manufacturers. Outbreaks are opportunities for philanthropic and public investments to create new governance systems with better decisions and not based on return of investment. However, when vaccines are developed in common with public bodies but licensed by a private company, the public institutions often lose influence on the final pricing, production facilities, and distribution areas. Medicines and vaccines are typically ordinary goods existing by the rules of the financial market; however, a new governance model should provide a new special status to tackle this topic particularly in poorer regions, because you cannot both maximize profit in medicines and have affordable medicines for all.",

Animal models could be much better explored to predict human vaccine efficacy, and there is a need to look for a broad input from veterinary science. Prevention and control of transboundary animal diseases that threaten food security and public health depends on the \u201cOne Health\u201d principle and cooperation at an international level.
