Volatile anesthetics\ninduce direct relaxation of airway smooth muscle (ASM) by the reduction of\nintracellular free calcium via inhibition of protein kinase C, calcium release from\nsarcoplasmic reticulum, or voltage-dependent calcium channels [20\u201322]. In\naddition, volatile anesthetics are known to reduce the sensitivity of the\nmyofibrillar contractile apparatus to intracellular calcium [23]. In vivo, bronchodilation with inhaled agents depends on\ndiffusion across the airway wall to reach their pharmacologic site of action [24,25]. While this may be most readily achieved via luminal diffusion\nacross the airway wall, systemic uptake and distribution to ASM is also possible via\nthe bronchial or pulmonary circulations. Inhaled anesthetic agents also dilate\nairways indirectly by reducing vagal tone and reflexes, and by altering\n\u03b2-receptor sensitivity and circulating catecholamines [26\u201328].",

In this study,\nwe hypothesized that diffusion of inhaled anesthetics from airway lumen to ASM would\nyield significant bronchodilation in vivo, and systemic recirculation would not be\nnecessary to reduce lung resistance and elastance during sustained\nbronchoconstriction. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel\nanesthetic-ventilator system to deliver volatile agents selectively to the\nconducting airways, or continuously to both the conducting airways and gas\nexchanging alveolar region.

Previous modeling studies\nhave shown that asthma is associated with heterogeneous constriction of the\nairway tree, particularly in smaller peripheral airways [52\u201355], though imaging studies suggest that partial closure\nof larger bronchi also contribute [56\u201358].\nVenegas et al. [59,60] have shown that\n\u201cbi-stable\u201d terminal airways, which exist as either fully opened\nor nearly closed, can lead to poorly ventilated lung regions called ventilation\ndefects [50] via dynamic feedback\ninteractions involving both the central bronchi and peripheral airways [59,61]. Consequently, flow redistribution away from such ventilation\ndefects would promote more heterogeneous delivery of the inhaled anesthetic,\ncausing bronchodilation of unaffected airways, which may limit the overall\nefficacy of these agents, or even potentially increase ventilation\nheterogeneity. These increases in airway heterogeneity may contribute to\nsubstantial increases in apparent RL and\nEL as measured at the airway opening,\nespecially at physiologic breathing frequencies [55], which would potentially mask our ability to detect\nany bronchodilation resulting from direct action of the inhaled anesthetic on\nASM. Similarly, MCh-induced hypersecretion of mucus in the airways [62] may facilitate partial or complete\nairway closure and formation of mucus plugs [63,64], which would occlude\nsmall airways and limit the amount of inhaled anesthetic reaching constricted\nairways. Such an effect would limit the effectiveness of this delivery method\nand may have played a role in cases where RL and\nEL actually increased and\nVD decreased.",

            "text": "We previously proposed that the serial composition of an inspired gas could be\nmanipulated to target the anatomic dead space [29]. The concept of different portions of the inspired tidal volume\nhaving variable gas concentrations is familiar to anesthesiologists using\ntraditional \u201cMapleson\u201d style semi-open breathing circuits [65]. In a similar study of serial gas\nmanipulation, Brogan et al. [66]\ndemonstrated that ventilation\u2013perfusion matching could be improved by\napplication of CO2 to the conducting airways exclusively, with\ntargeted delivery achieved by manual injection of CO2 during the\nsecond half of inspiration. Our anesthetic delivery system advances this method\nby providing an automated delivery window based on volume capnography, which can\nbe varied to match the subject's dead space volume. Such a delivery\nmethod is not possible with conventional anesthesia machines, which operate via\ncircular breathing circuits designed to maintain a constant agent concentration.\nWhile uncommon in general clinical practice, draw-over anesthesia relies on\n\u201cpulling\u201d fresh gas across a vaporizer during spontaneous\nbreathing of the patient [67]. By\ncombining the U-PAC vaporizer in series with a ventilator, fresh gas can be\n\u201cpushed\u201d across the vaporizer, facilitating rapid response for\ntargeted delivery of the inhaled anesthetic. The reduced size, compatibility\nwith multiple agents, and operational simplicity of the U-PAC vaporizer provides\nan ideal method for the delivery of inhaled anesthetics in clinical settings,\nwhere there are limited options available for administration of these agents to\npatients [6].",

            "text": "Compared to continuous delivery, we found that targeted delivery resulted in a\nsignificantly reduced dose of inhaled anesthetic, as well as a lowered residual\nconcentration at end-expiration (Figs. 7\nand 8). This suggests that restricting\ninhaled anesthetics to the end of inspiration facilitated delivery to the\nconducting airways while decreasing systemic uptake and redistribution, which is\nan important consideration given that the consistent clinical use of these\nagents can be limited by negative systemic side effects [1]. However, a small concentration of end-tidal anesthetic\nduring targeted delivery was still detected (Fig. 8), suggesting that some alveolar delivery and/or uptake of\nanesthetic via the conducting airways may have occurred [28,37]. Since\nthe canine airway tree is highly asymmetric and leads to a distribution of path\nlengths between the trachea and terminal alveoli [61], a delivery profile appropriate for longer path\nlengths would have the potential of anesthetic reaching alveoli at shorter\ndistances relative to the airway opening. While these factors may have resulted\nin some systemic absorption during targeted delivery, the corresponding\nend-expiratory concentration was considerably lower compared to that for\ncontinuous delivery, consistent with lower systemic absorption of the\nanesthetics, although not directly measured here.",

Yet we\nobserved that changes in VD and\nRL were closely related during maximal\nbronchoconstriction and airway relaxation with atropine. Therefore, imaging\nmodalities such as high-resolution computed tomographic and magnetic resonance\nimaging can provide further insight into the ventilation distribution and degree\nof heterogeneity during bronchoconstriction, while potentially resolving\ndisparities between trends in lung resistance and anatomic dead space [31]. Additionally, these experiments\nfocused on the dilation of constricted airways during cholinergic agonism.\nMethacholine has been shown to constrict the central airways predominantly,\nwhereas an allergen-induced bronchoconstriction leads to a more peripheral\npattern of constriction that can manifest through important ventilation defects\nas discussed previously [68].

Protective flow redistribution and\nhypersecretion of mucus could have limited the amount of inhaled anesthetic\ndelivered to constricted airways, while corresponding increases in lung\nheterogeneity may have led to increased apparent lung resistance and elastance in\nsome cases.
