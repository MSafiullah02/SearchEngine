Using a dynamic panel model with daily reported number of cases for US counties over a 20-day period, the paper develops a Vulnerability Index for each county from an epidemiological model of disease spread. County-level economic, demographic, and health factors are used to explain the differences in the values of this index and thereby the transmission and concentration of the disease across the country. These factors are also used in a zero-inflated negative binomial pooled model to examine the number of reported deaths. The paper finds that counties with high per capita personal income have high incidence of both reported cases and deaths. The unemployment rate is negative for deaths implying that places with low unemployment rates or higher economic activity have higher reported deaths. Counties with higher income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient experienced more deaths and reported more cases. There is a remarkable similarity in the distribution of cases across the country and the distribution of distance-weighted international passengers served by the top international airports. Counties with high concentrations of non-Hispanic Blacks, Native Americans, and immigrant populations have higher incidence of both cases and deaths. The distribution of health risk factors such as obesity, diabetes, smoking are found to be particularly significant factors in explaining the differences in mortality across counties. Counties with higher numbers of primary care physicians have lower deaths and so do places with lower hospital stays for preventable causes. The stay-at-home orders are found to be associated with places of higher cases and deaths implying that they were perhaps imposed far too late to have contained the virus in the places with high-risk populations. It is hoped that research such as these will help policymakers to develop risk factors for each region of the country to better contain the spread of infectious diseases in the future.",

The impact of the virus in the United States started to grab public attention from late February and many states started imposing stay-at-home orders in mid-March, 2020. The dramatic increase in the number of infected patients in a nursing home in Seattle, Washington stunned a nation and made evident the contagiousness of the virus and its lethality. While the national attention was focused on Seattle, the virus was taking a deadly hold in New York city and its surroundings. With every passing day, one state after another started announcing their first reported cases. No US state has been spared. However, the spread of the virus has been anything but uniform.

Figure 1 clearly indicates that the spread of the virus has been in regions of high economic activity on the two coasts. The virus has arrived on the US shores through international travel. While the initial spread of the virus is expected to be triggered by international travel and economic activity, it is important to understand whether its continued spread and concentration is restricted to such places. As the lockdown continues and the medical profession is trying to understand the susceptibility of individuals in contracting the disease, this paper attempts to understand the underlying socioeconomic conditions of the geographic regions around the US that make them susceptible to becoming hotspots. This is related to the question about the factors that determine the gradient followed by the virus as it spreads through the country.",

(which was not certified by peer review) that the underlying demographic and health/lifestyle factors have a more significant impact in explaining deaths than disease spread. This is not a surprising result since the spread of the virus does not depend on a person's ethnicity or education status. Once people contract the disease, however, the health outcome depends on a multitude of factors that go beyond an individual's control. The paper uses available county level data to identify economic, demographic, and health/lifestyle risk factors for different parts of the US. The paper finds that people in regions of high economic activity and economic inequality are particularly at elevated risk of both disease spread and mortality. There is a remarkable parallel between the spread of the disease and distanceweighted distribution of passengers arriving at international airports. The demographic distribution in terms of race shows higher vulnerability both in terms of disease contraction and death for non-Hispanic Blacks, Native Americans, and immigrants. Counties with higher numbers of personal care physicians per 1000 individuals have lower deaths and so do places with fewer preventable cases of hospital stays. Some of the high risk factors such as obesity, diabetes, are found to have a more mixed result. This can be partly explained by the fact that many of these risk factors have a high degree of concentration in many of the southern states.",

The paper includes the number of days since the onset of stay-at-home orders issued by governors at the state level across the country. This variable is not found to be statistically significant in influencing the vulnerability index in the spread of the virus. Regions that have longer stay-at-home orders have experienced higher number of deaths. These regions would have experienced much higher number of cases and deaths without those orders. It is likely that they were imposed too late to have been successful in containing the virus. This paper has identified socioeconomic and health/lifestyle factors that have played a critical role in helping the virus to develop a stronghold in certain parts of the country and cause high fatalities. It is true that a single gathering of individuals can lead to a spike in the number of cases and large number of deaths in a region. The members of the Coronavirus Task Force 4 are monitoring where a sudden spike is occurring. As data on cases and deaths are collected, it is important to be able to better predict if the population of a certain area is particularly vulnerable to the disease. This paper shows that it is possible to develop a vulnerability index both for disease spread and deaths based on the socioeconomic composition of the population and their health/lifestyle choices. Developing such a profile will be particularly important as the various parts of the country contemplate lifting stay-at-home orders before the invention of a therapeutic or a vaccine.",

This paper shows that it is possible to utilize the economic, demographic, and lifestyle profiles of regions to develop a risk factor for each geographical area so that when the next epidemic arises, public officials are better prepared to anticipate where the hotspots are likely to arise and take the necessary containment steps. The experience with COVID-19 shows how rapidly an infectious disease can bring an economy down. Without advance preparation the next disease will be just as difficult to contain as this.

In the second step of the analysis, we use county-level economic, demographic, and health care factors to explain how they influence the vulnerability index for each county. The factors that may explain the county vulnerability index are classified into three groups. The first group of factors relate to the economic conditions and include factors such as: per capita personal income, the unemployment rate, the level of income inequality, poverty, access to housing, and concentration of different types of industries such as manufacturing, mining, and others. The second group of factors relate to a set of demographic factors including the size of the population and its density, the racial profile of the counties, the age distribution of the population, and the percentage of the population that was born outside the United States. The third group of factors considered include health or lifestyle related factors such as the number of primary care physicians per capita, the percentage of the population with obesity and diabetes, the percentage of the population that smokes and drinks, the percentage of the population with inactive lifestyles. In addition to the county level economic, demographic, and health data, spatial factors are considered as well. The contagious nature of the disease compels one to consider the spillover effects to neighboring counties.

The results show that the economic factors have a similar impact on deaths. That is, counties with higher income and cases also experienced higher deaths. Counties with higher income inequality and housing shortage also experienced more deaths. In contrast to the results of the reported cases, this regression showed that not only are counties with higher percentages of non-Hispanic Blacks, Native Americans, and immigrants more likely to die relative to counties with non-Hispanic Whites, so are counties with a higher concentration of people with less than a college education. Counties with more personal care physicians per capita experienced lower deaths and so did counties with a lower percentage of the population with diabetes, smokers, and preventable hospital stays. Counties with higher obesity, HIV, and drinking are associated with lower deaths.",

There have been several such infections in the last ten years although none of them had the virulence or lethality of this virus. Most of them spread to a few countries and then disappeared. The developed world remained largely unaffected by most of them and the experience of this pandemic has laid bare the lack of infrastructure to respond to such an incident. The economics literature is not extensive in the area of pandemics and epidemics in developed countries. The contribution of this study is to understand the various socioeconomic conditions that can make a county or region more vulnerable to both disease spread and severity of cases. A national strategy to prepare the infrastructure for controlling the spread of infectious diseases should consider these factors and develop Vulnerability Indexes for each region.",

At each time t, the number of new infections will depend on the interactions of the susceptible (S) and infected (I) individuals. The infected individuals are non-infectious during the latent period and asymptomatic but infectious from the end of the latent period to the end of the incubation period and infectious with symptoms after the end of the incubation period. If j denotes the number of days it takes to become infectious, at time t the interactions of susceptible people with people infected t \u2212 j days earlier will lead to new cases.

The panel data approach in estimating the growth of the virus in different parts of the US allows us to introduce county-specific fixed effects in the estimation.

The results for the number of international passengers served by the airports measures the impact of the passengers in the counties in which the airports are located 1 and this variable is positive and significant in most models.

The foreign born or immigrant variable is significant in only the model with no population. It is not surprising that the other factors such as the age distribution or health indicators are not significant since anyone regardless of age and other health conditions can get infected.

The zero-inflated negative binomial distribution is preferred to the negative binomial when excessive zeros are present. Comparison of the model fit in terms of AIC and BIC values shows that the zero-inflated negative binomial better fits the data.

Counties with higher personal income and higher inequality in terms of income distrbution (Gini coefficient), severity of housing shortage have higher numbers of reported deaths even after controlling for the number of cases. Consistent with the income result, the unemployment coefficient is negative.While the demographic and health related factors were largely not significant except for the racial distribution of the population, in this regression of the number of reported deaths, the demographic factors are more impactful. The results show that the counties with a higher percentage of the population with less than a college education have higher deaths and so do counties with a higher percentage of females.
