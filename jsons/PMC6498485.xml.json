Bioactive lipids are known to play crucial roles in the pathophysiology of inflammation, changes in their concentrations affect cell functions, often intracellular trafficking and signaling, cell adhesion, migration, and apoptosis [6]. Moreover, novel lipid mediators derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), including lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and maresins, have drawn great attention for their dual anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving effects in inflammation [7, 8]. Bioactive lipids and their derivatives could be promising therapeutic targets for CAP in the near future [9].",

Furthermore, the serum level of sphinganine was significantly elevated in severe CAP (SCAP), indicating a potential key role for this sphingolipid in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. In order to characterize the changes in these bioactive lipids during pneumonia, we applied untargeted lipidomic profiling on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples. Given that BALF has been described as a \u201cliquid biopsy\u201d for its diagnostic utility, this noninvasive approach represented the most effective means to uncover a lung-specific lipidomic response in vivo. We conducted principal component analysis (PCA) to identify correlations between BALF lipidomes and clinical features of patients, as well as clustering analysis to explore the existence of lipid clusters. We found specific correlations between levels of two lipid species and prevalent phagocytes in BALF, as well as three distinct lipid profiles that correlate with degree of airway inflammation. This pilot study introduces the possible utility of BALF lipidome profiles as a future aid in tailoring of CAP therapies.",

Aliquots were then retrieved by gentle suctioning through the suction port of the bronchoscope. No suction was performed before sample collection. Total and differential cell counts, etiological examination, and protein concentration of BALF samples were analyzed respectively at the time of collection in local labs.

Detailed parameters for the untargeted lipid analyses were set following the protocols of our previously reported study [14] and described in the Additional file 1: Supplementary Method. Data-dependent MS/MS acquisition (DDA) of all samples was analyzed using TraceFinderTM (Thermo, CA). Lipids were assigned using an in-house lipid database in \u201cscreening\u201d mode and qualified in \u201cquan\u201d mode. Lipids were identified based on matching precursor and characteristic fragment masses. Five ppm and 10 ppm mass tolerance was used for precursor and fragment, respectively.

Subsequently, to evaluate if the host-lipidome in BALF could be partitioned into clusters with distinct lipidomic phenotypes, k-means partitional clustering [20] was employed based on the lipid profiles of all subjects using MetaboAnalyst 4.0. An optimal number of clusters k is the one that maximizes the average silhouette over a range of possible values for k. The elbow method [21] was used to determine the optimal number of clusters using the R package \u201cNbClust\u201d [22]. The idea of the elbow method is to run k-means clustering on the dataset for a range of values of k, and for each value of k calculate the sum of squared errors (SSE). For correlation studies, the two-tailed Spearman test was used to calculate correlation significance. Multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis was then conducted using a stepwise method to adjust multi-colinearity inherent in lipidomic data.",

This approach yielded three separate lipid clusters (LClusters) (Fig. 4a). Clinical and laboratory characteristics were compared in detail amongst the three clusters (Table 3): LClus1, LClus2, and LClus3. The percentages of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) in BALF significantly differed among the three clusters, with the highest value in LClus1 and the lowest in LClus3 (Fisher\u2019s exact test, p < 0.0001, Fig. 4d); while the percentages of macrophage revealed an opposite tendency (Fig. 4e). Since PMN infiltration plays a central role in inflammation and is a major cause of tissue damage, we stratified our subjects into high- (LClus1), medium- (LClus2), and low- (LClus3) inflammatory response groups. Patients in LClus1 were characterized by lower serum concentrations of albumin (ALB) and total cholesterol (TC) (Fisher\u2019s exact test, p < 0.01). The incidence of hypoxemia was significantly higher in LClus1 (6/6, 100%) than in the other two groups (17.57% in LClus2 and 7.5% in LClus3, p = 0.008 and 0.005, respectively). Half of the patients in LClus1 received invasive positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) therapy (Fisher\u2019s exact test, p = 0.022), which is the highest ratio of three clusters, although without statistical significance in the following pairwise comparisons. In addition, patients in LClus1 were predicted to have the highest mortality (defined as Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) class = 5, Fig. 4c). Based on the above findings, we presumed that the different intensities of inflammatory responses were also associated with diverse disease severity degrees. Goodman\u2019s & Kruskal\u2019s Gamma test showed statistically significant positive correlations between the inflammatory response rankings (high-, medium-, and low-) and the degree of disease severity, which were assessed using the following severity scoring systems: PSI (p = 0.045, G = 0.429), CURB-65 (p = 0.034, G = 0.446) and APACHE II (p = 0.007, G = 0.565), respectively. However, patients in the high- and the medium- response groups both revealed high mortality rate (16.7% vs 15.2%, Fisher\u2019s exact test, p > 0.05).

LClus1 was characterized by the highest mean relative abundance of unsaturated FA (including MUFA and PUFA) and CerG2 classes. In contrast, LClus2 exhibited the highest level of SFA and TG classes, and the lowest level of sphingolipids (SM and GM3 classes) and phospholipids (PC, PE, PG, PI, and PS classes). Subsequently, we identified 41 lipid species (Additional file 2: Table S3) that differed amongst all three clusters (ANOVA with Tukey host HSD test, FDR adjusted p-value < 0.05). In accordance with the results of lipid class analysis, we observed significant abundant n-3 PUFA (FA 18:3, \u03b1-linolenic acid) in LClus1. Two SFA species (FA 16:0 and FA 18:0, comprising 53.62% of the total lipid signal) and 3 TG species were notably increased, while 7 SM, 12 PC, 8 PE, 1 PG, 5 PI, and 2 PS species were significantly decreased in LClus2.

We found that in BALF samples from CAP patients, the levels of unsaturated FA, CerG2, and PE classes were increased compared to controls, while the So class was decreased. Using classifications based on clinical-demographic features (regardless of disease severity, age, gender, or pathogen types) with principal component analysis revealed no clear patterns of separation for distinguishing lipid profiles that correlated with any of the clinical features. However, cluster analysis identified three distinct lipid clusters; subjects in different clusters exhibited significant differences in disease severity, the incidence of hypoxemia, the percentages of PMNs and macrophages in BALF, and the serum concentrations of albumin and total cholesterol. We also identified individual lipids at the molecular level (SM d34:1 and PE 18:1p/20:4) that significantly correlated with the phagocytes (PMNs and macrophages) in BALF. Our findings thus suggest that the specific lipid composition in the lower airway may relate to the intensity of the host inflammatory response, rather than clinical and demographic differences, and may contribute to functionally relevant shifts in CAP disease pathogenesis. Based on their appearance in consistent ratios across severely inflamed cases of CAP, SM d34:1 and PE 18:1p/20:4 may serve as reliable diagnostic markers for increased infiltration by macrophage and PMNs, respectively, which accompany local points of tissue inflammation, and thus may serve as potentially useful starting points for development of targeted therapeutics for CAP infection.",

Tisoncik et al. [24] reported significant abundant phospholipids (PC and PE species) in bronchial epithelial cells of ferrets in response to influenza virus infection. They speculate that the lipid mediators derived from phospholipid arachidonic acid (FA 20:4) reservoirs may contribute to tissue damage during pandemic H1N1 influenza virus infection. Our finding that PE 18:1p/20:4 is positively correlated with PMN percentages in BALF may support their hypothesis. The 20:4 side-chain in PE 18:1p/20:4 can be cleaved to form arachidonic acid, the precursor to eicosanoids converted by the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme. Increased production of arachidonic acid-derived pro-inflammatory prostaglandin and leukotriene levels [25] can induce PMN infiltration [26, 27], enhance inflammatory responses, and finally lead to tissue damage. In addition, although sphingolipid signal transduction pathways have been known to play an important role in the regulation of growth and survival pathways in macrophages [28], the exact role of SM (d34:1) still requires future research.",

Furthermore, BALF levels of unsaturated FA (including MUFA and PUFA) are significantly elevated in CAP and the high-inflammatory response group (LClus1); while levels of SFA are increased in the medium-inflammatory response group (LClus2). Third, several MUFAs (FA 16:1, FA 18:1, and FA 20:1) could be effective markers for SCAP. Moreover, FA 18:3, an n-3 PUFA, is notably elevated in the high-inflammatory response group (LClus1).",

            "text": "Previous studies have revealed that both levels and compositions of FAs are associated with inflammation [29]. Generally, SFAs are considered as pro-inflammatory lipid mediators as they induce the inflammation by mimicking the actions of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [30], activating the NLRP3 inflammasome [31], and inducing NF\u039aB signaling [32], etc. In contrast, PUFAs are commonly considered as anti-inflammatory lipid mediators as they can inhibit inflammasome activation [33] and can inhibit endothelial cell activation following exposure to LPS [34]. In addition, specialized pro-resolving lipid (SPM) mediators (the resolvins and the protectins/neuroprotectins) derived from n-3 PUFA [35] reveal their role as anti- and pro-resolving inflammation as well as enhancing microbial clearance [8]. Unexpectedly, our data suggested the opposite tendencies of pro- and anti-inflammatory lipid alternations in either CAP patients or patients in LClus1. Recently Sun and colleagues report that same pattern of accumulation of serum palmitic acid (FA 16:0) during H7N9 pneumonia. The levels of palmitic acid decreased while the clinical conditions became more severe, and increased as the disease was ameliorated [36]. Schmidt et al. also found that PUFA increased approximately 3-fold in BALF of adult respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) patients [37]. In light of our own data, which agrees with the findings of Schmidt and Sun, we are compelled to reconsider the pro- and anti-inflammatory designations assigned to bioactive lipids, since their proposed activity is not supported by our HPLC-MS data in CAP patients. We speculate that the role of bioactive lipids, such as PUFAs in mitigating inflammation, is context dependent and may be influenced by other factors that fall outside the scope of this study.",

Previous studies have reported hypertriglyceridemia during infection, and different types of infection (bacterial, viral, or fungal) result in similar effects on triglyceride metabolism [38\u201341]. Infection-associated hypertriglyceridemia is induced via increased hepatic lipoprotein production and/or decreased lipoprotein catabolism [42]. However, some clinical studies came to the opposite conclusion, partially supporting our observations, in that lower or no significantly changes in triglyceride levels were observed in critically ill and severely infected patients [43, 44].
