Lung disease accounts for 15% of disability-adjusted life-years in the world. This should draw the attention of global bodies such as the World Economic Forum, whose pronouncements beget health-care policies, public health programs, and research dollars. Although other diseases, such as diabetes and coronary artery disease, have captured world attention, the diseases of the lung have not shared a similar status in the public eye. In the United States alone, lung disease costs $15 billion annually.",

For the first time in history, all the prominent respiratory societies around the globe were engaged in a coordinated effort to focus attention on all aspects of lung disease. The objectives of the YOL were to: (1) promote global awareness of lung health issues and diseases, (2) increase funding for lung health research, (3) develop and implement tools to prevent lung disease and disability, (4) diagnose and treat lung disease early in the course of illness, (5) research new diagnostic tools and medicines to treat and cure lung disease, and (6) encourage programs that promote personal lung health.",

Public statements were issued on designated days to focus on lung diseases and raise awareness, such as Lung Cancer Day and COPD Day. For the first time, a World Spirometry Day was organized on October 14th 2010. Spirometry, the simple monitoring tool of lung function, is not used with regularity even in developed countries and is not readily available to those in the developing world. The journals of the FIRS organizations have carried articles highlighting the YOL, a signature campaign for the declaration has been an ongoing project at all the meetings, and legislators have been educated on the problem in the United States and many other countries. Each organization has planned and executed many projects to celebrate the YOL. A Web site (http://www.2010yearofthelung.org) created to specifically communicate about this initiative has received nearly a half million interested visitors. The logo symbolizing the FIRS partnership, diversity and global involvement, is now a well-recognized symbol of lung health.",

The Ambassadors group of The Chest Foundation has intensified teaching school and college students about the hazards of tobacco in its many forms. The annual CHEST meeting in Vancouver, BC, Canada, hosted many sessions that highlighted the YOL. ACCP has many resources, such as lung cancer and thromboembolism guidelines, disseminated worldwide. By coordinating World Spirometry Day in North America with the ATS, we have been making the public aware of the importance of this testing.",

FIRS organizations have banded together and collaborated effectively in promoting lung health. This integrated effort should translate into more research dollars, governmental programs, and supportive policy decisions. The ACCP is both equipped and poised to be an active participant with its large and international membership around the world. Backed by the enthusiastic members, the leadership remains committed to keeping the candle burning for this important cause.",
