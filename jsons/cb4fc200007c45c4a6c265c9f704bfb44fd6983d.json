Imagine that the suppression measures have worked so well in a country or a major city that only a small number of cases are reported daily. Can people return to the kind of life and work they had before the outbreak of COVID-19? Unless herd immunity has been achieved or a curative treatment has been discovered, the answer is likely no because a few cases a day will start a new cycle of exponential increase, turning into thousands of cases a day in a matter of weeks or months. The current proposals for economic reopening all include ubiquitous social distancing. As long as social distancing is in place, there is no normalcy. To return to genuine normalcy and sustain it, people must feel the risk of infection is low and it must remain that way indefinitely. In other words, the state of having a low number of infections in the population must be a steady one rather than merely the beginning stage of an exponential growth.",

Once the individual is confirmed to be infected, he/she can choose to allow the government server to access the data in the phone app, which helps identify close contacts. Apple and Google have made announcement that they will launch a comprehensive solution at the level of application programming interfaces (APIs) and operating systems to assist in enabling contact tracing using apps developed by thirdparty developers and/or public health authorities [2] . User privacy features strongly in their solution. For instance, explicit user consent is required to use the contact data, personally identifiable information or user location data will not be collected, and the list of contacted people never leaves a user's phone. European research institutions and governments are behind the proposals in [3] , [4] , which also have strong privacy-protection components.

They exhibit a somewhat laissez-faire philosophy for adoption and use of such systems. First, for perfectly understandable reasons of not looking draconian, the advocacy for adoption is drastically toned down with messages such as 'people should pass words around and opt in'. Second, the contact information is only made available incrementally. When tracing reaches an individual, a request is sent and contact information becomes available after the individual's consent [1] . We make stronger claims here and we attempt to substantiate them. The contact-tracing strategy based on proximity sensing can keep the disease fully contained without the need of other mitigation measures such as social distancing or universal mask-wearing. It is not just a nice thing to have that complements other measures; it can end social distancing and allow the society to return to full normalcy. However, in order to achieve that, the adoption rate needs to be very high. We show that the ability to trace an entire cluster of infections is important, rather than just a subset of the individuals on best-effort basis. For that, it is crucial that the contact information from all individuals in the cluster is available, and preferably in real time to minimize the response time. Other proposals that use more laid-back approaches do not allow easy tracing of an entire cluster.",

The reason these measures work is that together they can reduce the reproduction ratio, which is the average number of individuals directly infected by one patient. The reproduction ratio is a key parameter governing the dynamics of the number of infected cases. When the reproduction ratio is greater than 1, with a very high chance, the number of infections grows exponentially fast. Clearly, the smaller the reproduction ratio, the slower the number of infections grows. If the ratio is reduced to below 1, the exponential growth will not happen and the number of infections will collapse until it reaches zero. For COVID-19, earlier estimates put the basic reproduction ratio, usually denoted by R o , in the range between 3 to 4. One recent estimate put it as high as 5.7 [5] . It is not clear whether the measures taken by aforementioned Asian regions have reduced it to a number below 1 or just slightly above 1.",

Among the three measures, how to improve the testing capability and speed has attracted a great deal of effort and it is expected that testing will soon not be a bottleneck. It is also hopeful that countries and regions will eventually see the value of and institute solid quarantine processes. 1 Contact tracing remains a problem, as traditional contact tracing requires boots on the ground, and therefore, is labor-intensive and suffers long delay. Importantly, it suffers a more difficult, inherent traceability challenge. A patient may be unable to recall all the contacts he/she made, and anonymous contacts in public places are not traceable.

By tracing through B 1 's contact history, it is possible to discover C 1 . By tracing through A's contact history, it is possible to discover A 2 . The whole cluster of patients originated from A will be all accounted for. Note that the cluster can be represented as a directed graph -in fact, a tree -where each node represents an individual and an edge represents infection by contact. Let us call it the infection tree. From our description of the infection events, A can be recognized as being upstream to A 1 with respect to the path of infection. However, during actual tracing, from A 1 's contact history alone, it is not immediately clear whether A infected A 1 or the other way around. More generally, the graph constructed from the contact information of all the involved individuals will initially look different from the underlying infection tree. It may have more nodes, which corresponds to contacted individuals who are not infected; the direction of the edges remain to be determined; and there may be even loops in the graph. Such a graph needs to be processed to infer the infection tree. Doing so will require not only contact information but also testing results to prune non-patients and auxiliary information such as how the disease progresses.

The small inconvenience of carrying the device can be viewed as the price to pay for returning to normal life. \u2022 Personal benefits: The individual will benefit from getting notified very quickly should he/she be in contact with an infected person, which allows timely testing, proper quarantine (so that the individual's family is protected) and early medical care for improved outcome. \u2022 Civic duty: Carrying the device can be viewed as fulfilling a civic duty required by public health measures. It can be compared to getting the required vaccines or complying with orders such as stay-at-home, social distancing, or closure of business operations or other activities. An individual who carries the device (let us call such an individual an adopter) helps everyone else while helping him/herself. \u2022 Social expectation: People may be more willing to interact with an adopter because he/she can rightfully be perceived as being 'less dangerous' than a nonadopter. If an adopter were in fact infectious, there would have been ample pathways in the tracing that lead to him/her. The fact that he/she is not isolated gives credence that he/she has not been infected. Nothing like that can be said about a non-adopter. Once the practice of carrying the device is adopted widely enough, it may become a social norm.",

There is a related problem, which we will call the manifestation problem: If an infected individual does not show any symptoms or shows only mild symptoms, he/she may not seek medical care to be tested. In principle, recall is not needed if there is no manifestation problem; every patient will show enough symptoms and will be tested. On the other hand, if there is perfect recall, the manifestation problem will go away because in a growing cluster of infections someone will show enough symptoms to be tested and everyone in the cluster will be recalled, including patients with no or mild symptoms.",

For COVID-19, it is difficult to know precisely what percentage of the infected individuals are asymptomatic (or presymptomatic). Iceland tested a portion of its population and found 50% of those who tested positive showed no symptoms [6] . Other reports vary greatly, putting the percentage as low as less than 10% and as high as more than 90%. Much may have to do with confusing the presymptomatic cases with true asymptotic cases [7] . Among the symptomatic patients, it has been estimated that between 10% \u2212 20% of them are severe enough to require hospitalization. With the combined effects of asymptomatic, presymptomatic and mild cases, a cluster may grow to a size between one dozen to even one hundred infected individuals before one of them seeks medical attention. By then, the cluster of infected would have been in contact with a large number of people who end up not being infected, making the task of recall even more challenging. For tracing to work perfectly, the recall needs to be enough to include all the contacts that have led to infection, which is often impossible without the help of contact recorders. Consequently, manual tracing often misses many patients in a cluster, especially those asymptomatic or mild cases, as is well documented.",

Since universal adoption is difficult to achieve and may be deemed draconian, we ask the natural question whether the strategy can remain effective if certain percentage of people are opt out, and if so, what that percentage is. Here, effectiveness is with respect to the original goal of keeping the number of infections low on a consistent basis. The quick answer is: Universal adoption is not necessary; however, to achieve the stated goal, the adoption rate needs to be very high. We will argue this formally. The often-used notations are summarized in Table  I . Table I OFTEN-USED NOTATIONS R 0 basic reproduction ratio = 1/R 0 Re effective reproduction ratio with tracing and quarantine N a random variable representing the number of direct infections by a patient A, A i patient A infects individuals A 1 , . . . , A N \u03c7 effective number of direct infections caused by a patient X i contribution (0 or 1) to \u03c7 by A i , and \u03c7 = N i=1 X i \u03c0 0 probability that a cluster eventually stops growing under the condition of no mitigation measures \u03c0 1 1 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , the probability that a cluster grows to infinity p adoption rate p * minimum required adoption rate such that Re < 1 \u03bd probability that a patient shows severe symptoms \u00b5 k probability that at least one patient shows severe symptoms in a cluster of size k EC(A i ) eventual size of the cluster started by patient A i when there is no tracing Y the random variable representing the cluster size when the first patient is tested First, it is clear that the more people who carry contact recorders, the more effective the contact-tracing strategy is in curbing the spread of the virus. However, it may be the case that, at a certain adoption rate of the device, the tracing strategy can slow down the growth of the number of infections, but it is still an exponential growth, just a slow one. If the goal is to maintain a very low number of infections as a steady state, the effective reproduction ratio needs to be kept below 1. We will show that there is a cutoff value with respect to the required adoption rate.",

For COVID-19, if 50% of the infected individuals are asymptomatic and 10% of the symptomatic patients develop severe conditions, then, on average, one out of a cluster of 20 patients has severe symptoms, which can be picked up and tested by the medical system. In that case, \u03bd can be taken as 0.05. Table III also shows the result for \u03bd = 0.02, which is relevant if the true asymptomatic cases are drastically more than the current estimate or if the medical system is overly relaxed and not picking up infection cases frequently enough. The result for \u03bd = 0.1 shows the benefits if the disease surveillance system can pick up patients with mild symptoms quickly, for instance, by widespread temperature measurement. The required adoption rate can be lowered to the more manageable 95% range. To pursue the benefit further, in Fig. 2 , we plot the upper boundp against a wider range of \u03bd.

Such phones satisfy most of the requirements listed earlier. However, one of the main problems is that their distance measurement is not accurate because the distance is estimated solely based on RSSI (received signal strength indicator). As an example, in the current implementation of iOS's iBeacon, the sensed distance is categorized into immediate (i.e., the two phones are pretty much next to each other), near (maybe up to a few meters), and far (anything above near). To act as contact recorders, immediate and near are close to the intended sensing range. If two phones fall into the immediate range, it is almost certainly the case that the two individuals are in close contact. If they fall in the near range, the individuals may be under a meter to a few meters apart. They may or may not be in the infection range. In those cases, timing information such as the duration of contact can be combined with the distance information when the server assesses the risk of infection. For instance, if the contact lasted 30 minutes in the near range, then the risk of infection may be considered high. Overall, the contact-tracing strategy can still be effective if the inaccuracy in distance measurement is compensated by more aggressive risk evaluation, testing, and quarantine.",

Once a mobile phone detects a nearby beacon, it records the beacon ID and time of encounter. In the backend, the server has information on where exactly that beacon is located. When a patient is discovered, the beacon IDs recorded on his/her phone can be used to determine the places that the patient has been to and the time of the visits. For instance, with beacons installed on subway trains, it is possible to identify which car of a subway train the patient has traveled on. The subway car may be disinfected if needed. Moreover, if the virus can be transmitted over a longer distance in aerosols or in droplets carried by air flows from air conditioner systems, which is likely the case for the coronavirus, people who are in the same closed space but not within the close-range contact distance are also at risk. Such beacon-based tracing can be used to discover those individuals.",

When entering a public place such as a building or a bus, each individual uses a phone app to scan a QR code displayed at that location. This way, the backend server knows who entered the place at different time. If an individual is later confirmed to be infected, the server is able to identify all the people who were together with the infected individual at a location. Although the QR codes are easier to deploy, the beacon-based scheme has the advantage that the phones automatically scan beacon signals. Manual scanning of QR codes can become tiresome if an individual has to scan many times a day at different places. Without service personnel stationed at each QR-code location, people may eventually skip scanning the code. The beacon-based scheme is far more scalable, making it possible to cover the public space finely.",

However, quarantine and contact tracing are infectioncontrol measures that can be applied immediately. The mobile device and the tracing strategy outlined here may become part of the public health measures to combat future pandemics. At any moment, the society should have a version of the mobile device and a concrete tracing strategy that are readily deployable. Meanwhile and when time allows, the design of the mobile device can be continuously refined. In particular, there is a need to improve the accuracy of distance sensing, down to centimeter range, possibly by using different families of sensors or with the help of localization techniques such as triangulation. The inclusion of more biosensors can be very useful for disease surveillance and patient monitoring.",

In this paper, we will not review the details of what have been considered, but refer the readers to the relevant writings. We would like to emphasize that privacy preservation depends on the assumed operations of the tracing system. For instance, the APIs of Apple and Google address how to preserve anonymity between the two parties of a contact, and how to ensure consent before contact data is uploaded to the server. Simply put, the privacy and security features will depend on what data different components of the system collects, the movement of the data, and how the data are used. In light of the stated goal of this paper, we envision a system with maximum liberty in data collection and use. The server at any time should have all the needed information to trace and identify a cluster of contacts, and know how to reach them for testing. The questions are, under that setting, to what extent privacy can be preserved and how.",

In particular, the total number of contacts made by an infection cluster is likely many times more than the contacts that lead to actual infections. Testing must be able to keep up with the large number of contacts in order to correctly identify actual infections. Good quarantine operation is another costly component. Furthermore, to be able to detect infection clusters before they become too large, disease surveillance needs to be strengthened, for instance, by widespread temperature checking. To cope with the cost, much can be done to improve the tracing system as operational experiences accumulate. For instance, the system should adapt and learn to become more accurate in assessing infection risk, such as what sort of contacts are more likely to lead to infection, so as to reduce the number of tests needed.",

Depending on the actual adoption rate, we may not be able to end social distancing, but we may be able to greatly relax it. It is possible that a combination of device-based tracing, manual tracing, and some mild-form social distancing together can bring back much normalcy. As an evidence, even without device-based tracing, some Asian regions appear to have brought the reproduction ratio very close to 1 with intensive manual tracing, strong disease surveillance, and mild socialdistancing measures. If device-based tracing is adopted, it will not only save much of the effort of manual tracing, but it may be able to bring the reproduction ratio decisively below 1 and further reduce the need for social distancing. The conjecture remains to be proven. Simulation studies can provide some early indication.",

In Section IV-C, we discussed using beacons to deal with spread over longer distance in closed space, such as some form of airborne transmissions in restaurants or conference halls. The tracing for those situations works similarly as that for close-distance human contacts, except that the number of individuals that need to be screened is likely much larger. There are also transmissions through shared surfaces, such as shared coffee tables or elevator buttons. The beacon approach can also be useful for some of those situations to pinpoint the locations of transmissions. There will be situations where none of the device-based approaches can catch the origin of infection. In our framework, we could view each of such occasions as the start of a cluster. The first patient of the cluster will later be identified through tracing after transmissions through person-to-person contact begin. In the end, it is still the person-to-person direct transmissions that are of the primary concern, because both sides of each transmission are mobile. Furthermore, if transmissions of this type can be dealt with effectively, fewer people will be infected and less of the shared environment will be contaminated.",
