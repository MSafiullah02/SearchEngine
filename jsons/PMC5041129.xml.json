The L protein was absent in lineage 1 viruses, as seen in the enteroviruses and hepatoviruses. The aa sequence identity of the P1 region between lineage 1 viruses and other picornaviruses ranged from 10.2\u201328.9% (Table 3), and between the three Lineage1 viruses were 75.5\u201390.2%. The lineage 1 viruses had protein domains characteristic of HAV protein VP1-2A, with unknown function, located in the P1 region at aa 537\u2013681, 536\u2013681, and 536\u2013680, respectively. The cleavages sites of VP4/VP2 in these were not obvious in the P1 region, and were consistent as VL/GN (Table 4) in all three lineage 1 viruses. VP4 was very small (27 aa) in lineage 1 viruses, and lacked an N-terminal myristoylation signal. YPX3L \u201clate domain\u201d motifs (YPMYNL), which are highly conserved among primate hepatoviruses and contribute to HAV membrane envelopment by mediating capsid interactions with components of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport, were found in VP2 in all three lineage 1 viruses11. The P2 region of lineage 1 viruses shared 17.3\u201323.6% aa identity with other picornaviruses, and 76.1\u201386.7% with each other. The 2C protein of all of three lineage 1 viruses possessed the highly conserved GQRGSGKS (GxxGXGKS) NTP-binding site motif and the DDMGQ (DDLxQ) putative helicase-activity motif, with the third-position aa L replaced with M1213. The P-loop domain containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase was located around postions 1179\u20131324 in the 2C protein. The P3 region in the lineage 1 viruses shared 21.8\u201328.4% aa identity with other picornaviruses, and 77\u201383.6% identity with each other. The conserved tyrosine residue at the third position of the VPg protein in all known picornaviruses was present14. Peptidase C3A/C3B was located in the 3C protein between aa 1528\u20131694 in the lineage 1 viruses. Picornavirus proteins are expressed as a single polyprotein, which is cleaved by viral C3 cysteine protease. The active-site cysteine GYCG (GxCG) was also present in the 3C protein of the three lineage 1 viruses12.",

The complete aa sequence of FJ2015 showed 51.3% and 51.4% identities with rosavirus M-7 (AEM05832) and rosavirus A2 (YP_009028557), respectively. The L protein of FJ2015 was 170 aa long, and lacked the catalytic dyad (Cys and His) of papain-like thiol proteases found in the foot-and-mouth disease virus L protein17. A presumed zinc-binding motif, Cys-His-Cys-Cys, found in Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus and quail picornavirus18. L protein was also lacking.

The nt sequence from 295\u2013632 of the 5\u2032UTR of Tibet2015 had 72% identity with human coxsackievirus A11 (DQ995633), and that from 179\u2013628 of the 5\u2032UTR of NX2015 had 73% identity with enterovirus D68 (KT803600). Consistent with other enteroviruses, these two rodent enteroviruses had typical type I IRESs. The P1 region of lineage 4 viruses shared 16.8\u201332.8% aa identity with others genera of picornaviruses, and 68.6% identity with each other. Lineage 4 viruses also showed 36.3\u201338.2% aa identity with other members of the genus Enterovirus. The VP4/VP2 cleavage sites were LA/SP in the two viruses. The VP4 protein family was predicted to occur in the two lineage 4 viruses at aa positions 1\u201363 in Tibet2015 and 1\u201365 in NX2015. Interestingly, VP1 in the two novel rodent enteroviruses lacked the [PS] ALXAXETG motif present in others enteroviruses. The P2 region of the lineage 4 viruses shared 39.2\u201342.3% aa identity with enteroviruses, which was greater than that shared with others genera of picornaviruses (19.4\u201328.6%), and they also shared 70.2% aa identity with each other. The peptidase C3 domain was predicted in the 2A protein in the two lineage 4 viruses, at aa positions 815\u2013960 and 1015\u20131148 of Tibet2015, and 821\u2013961 and 1008\u20131133 of NX2015. The typical 2B protein, which enhances membrane permeability duration poliovirus infection, was also found in both lineage 4 viruses (Tibet2015: 1155\u20131317, NX2015: 1141\u20131278). Lineage 4 viruses also had an NTPase-motif23 (Tibet2015: GTPGCGKS, NX2015: GAPGTGKS) and helicase motif13 (Tibet2015: DDVGQ, NX2015: DDVGQ) in their 2C proteins. The P3 region of lineage 4 viruses shared 54.7\u201359.8% aa identity with enteroviruses, which was greater than that shared with other genera of picornaviruses (22.5\u201349.5%), and they shared 66% aa identity with each other. The poliovirus 3A protein-like domain was detected in both rodent enteroviruses at positions 1582\u20131639 and 1530\u20131586, respectively. This is a critical component of the poliovirus replication complex, and also inhibits transport from the host endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. Similar to other picornaviruses, these picornaviruses also contained the conserved GXCG motif (GQCG) in the 3C protein, which is considered to form part of the protease active site12. The RNA-binding domain motif KFRDI was found in both lineage 4 rodent enterovirus 3C proteins24.",

Firth et al.25 identified a wide range of known and novel viruses from groups that include important human pathogens, including sapoviruses, cardioviruses, kobuviruses, parechoviruses, rotaviruses, and hepaciviruses carried by commensal Rattus norvegicus in New York city25. The role of rodent picornaviruses in the evolution, transmission, and biology of picornaviruses remains unclear. Drexler et al.11 conducted a targeted search for hepatoviruses in 15,987 specimens of 209 small mammal species, and ancestral-state reconstructions suggested a hepatovirus origin in small insectivorous mammals, and a rodent origin of human HAV11. Zoll et al.8 reported the first isolation, full-length sequence, characterization, and epidemiology of a Saffold virus SAFV-3 isolate8. Evidence suggests that this SAFV is an ubiquitous human virus causing infections early in life. It is genetically related to Theiler\u2019s virus in rodents, and was classified as a new species in the genus Cardiovirus8. A novel picornavirus, provisionally named rosavirus 2, was recovered from the feces of a child in The Gambia. The complete genome of rosavirus 2 demonstrated 71.9% nt identity with its closest relative rosavirus M-7, an unclassified picornavirus identified from rodent fecal material16. Those findings indicated that rodents are reservoirs for a diversity of picornaviruses, and that may contribute to the disease burden of these viruses in humans. New and improved surveillance and prevention strategies for disease control should concentrate on rodent infection and disease25.",

In contrast, the rodent picornaviruses identified in the current study showed less specificity, and a particular picornavirus species was able to infect different rodents. Lineage 1 viruses were found in Dipus sagitta Pallas, Niviventer niviventer, and Microtus clarkei, lineage 4 viruses were found in Niviventer niviventer and Caryomys eva, and FJ2015 was found in Rattus losea. The situation of similar strains of rodent picornaviruses occurring in different rodent genera/species is also seen in other wild or domestic animals11313233.

According to the unrooted phylogenetic trees, lineage 1 viruses clustered with HAV to form the sole independent branch between insect viruses and mammalian picornaviruses. The origins of HAV were enigmatic prior to the recent discoveries of rodent-related and seal-related HAV1138. Lineage 1 viruses possessed relatively high aa homology with hepatovirus and tremoviruses. Similar to hepatovirus, the three lineage 1 viruses lacked the L protein and possessed an HAV viral protein VP1-2A domain of unknown function, which was also found in tremoviruses and phopivirus. Non-primate hepatoviruses \u201clate domain\u201d (YPX3L) motifs have been identified in lineage 1 viruses, and in seal-, bat-, hedgehog-, and rodent-related hepatoviruses, but not in tremoviruses. Lineage 1 viruses still have some genomic characteristics of HAV and have only low homology with other genera of picornaviruses. Lineage 1 viruses clustered with tremoviruses, hepatovirus and formed an independent branch that separated them from other genera of picornaviruses near the root of the phylogenetic tree. This indicates that the tremoviruses, hepatovirus and lineage 1 viruses have a common ancestor and evolved in their natural hosts, independently. Their co-evolution within their respective hosts contributed to their unique genomic characteristics. HAV originates in small insectivorous mammals and has evolved for interspecies transmission to rodents, given this evolution and the contact between humans and rodents HAV eventually evolved to infect humans11.",

MEGA5.0 (www.megasoftware.net) was used to align nt and deduced aa sequences using the MUSCLE package and default parameters. Phylogenetic trees showing the relationships among picornaviruses based on the aa sequences of P1 (capsid), P2, and P3 were generated using maximum likelihood mtREV with Freqs (+F) model, gamma distributed with invariant sites (G + I), with 1000 bootstrap replicates. Routine sequence alignments were performed using Clustal Omega, Needle (available at: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/), MegAlign (Lasergene, DNAstar, Madison, Wisconsin), and T-coffee with manual curation. The conserved protein families and domains were predicted using Pfam and InterProScan 5 (available at: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/services/proteins). Amino acid identities and genetic distances were calculated using the ML method and were performed using a Pairwise evolutionary distance (PED) calculation as the distance metric. All genome sequences have been submitted to GenBank, with accession numbers for the seven rodent picornaviruses of KX156153\u2013KX156159.",
