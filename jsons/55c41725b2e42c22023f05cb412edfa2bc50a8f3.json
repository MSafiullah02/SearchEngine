We outline an application of our method to model 439 9mer and 279 10mer 17 predicted epitopes displayed by the common allele HLA-A*02:01, and we make our models 18 publicly available through an online database (https://rosettamhc.chemistry.ucsc.edu).

Given the reduction in breadth and functionality of the na\u00efve T cell repertoire during aging 42 (7), identifying a minimal set of viral antigens that can elicit a protective response will enable the 43 design of diagnostic tools to monitor critical \"gaps\" in the T cell repertoire of high-risk cohorts, 44 which can be addressed using peptide or epitope string DNA vaccines (8).",

Specific amino acid polymorphisms along the peptide-binding 47 groove (termed A-F pockets) define a repertoire of 10 4 -10 6 peptide antigens that can be recognized 48 by each HLA allotype (9, 10). Several methods have been developed to predict the likelihood that 49 a target peptide will bind to a given allele (reviewed in (11)). Generally these methods make use 50 of available data sets in the Immune Epitope Database (12) to train artificial neural networks that 51 predict binding scores, and their performance varies depending on peptide length and HLA allele 52 representation in the database. Structure-based approaches have also been proposed to model the 53 bound peptide conformation de novo (reviewed in (13)). These approaches utilize various MCMC-54 based schemes to optimize the backbone and side chain degrees of freedom of the peptide/MHC 55 structure according to an all-atom scoring function derived from physical principles (14-16), that 56 can be further enhanced using modified scoring terms (17) or mean field theory (18). While these 57 methods do not rely on large training data sets, their performance is affected by bottlenecks in 58 sampling of different backbone conformations, and any possible structural adaptations of the HLA 59 peptide-binding groove.",

We found 241 template structures 95 bound to epitopes of lengths from 8 to 15 residues (of which 170 are 9mers and 61 are 10mers).96For each SARS-CoV-2 target peptide, we select a set of candidate templates of the same length by97 matching the target peptide anchor positions (P2 and P9/P10) to peptides found in all template 98 structures. Then, we utilized the BLOSUM62 (27) substitution matrix to score all remaining 99 positions in the pairwise alignment of the target/template sequences, and the PDB template with 100 the top alignment score was selected for modeling. For target peptides with no templates with 101 matched peptide anchors in the database, we scored all positions in the pairwise alignment and 102 select the top scoring template for modeling. 103 104 RosettaMHC modeling framework and database 105 RosettaMHC (manuscript in preparation) is a comparative modeling protocol developed using 106 PyRosetta (28) to model pMHC-I complexes. The program accepts as input a list of peptide 107 sequences, an HLA allele definition and a template PDB file (selected as described in the previous 108 step). To minimize \"noise\" in the simulation from parts of the MHC-I fold that do not contribute 109 to peptide binding, only the \u03b1 1 and \u03b1 2 domains are considered in all steps. For each peptide, a full 110 alignment between the target and template peptide/MHC sequences is performed using clustal 111 omega (29). The alignment is used as input to Rosetta's threading protocol (partial_thread.<ext>). 112 From the threaded model, all residues in the MHC-I groove that are within a heavy-atom distance 113 of 3.5 \u00c5 from the peptide are subjected to 10 independent all-atom refinement simulations using 114 the FastRelax method (30) and a custom movemap file.

The top three 116 models are selected based on the binding energies, and used to compute an average energy for 117 each peptide in the input list.

To identify all possible regular peptide binders to HLA-A*02:01 125 that are expressed by SARS-CoV-2, we used a recently annotated version of all open reading 126frames (ORFs) in the viral genome (31) from NCBI which was made available through the UCSC 127 genome browser (32). We used 9-and 10-residue sliding windows to scan all protein sequences, 128 since these are the optimum peptide lengths for binding to the HLA-A*02:01 groove (33). While129 spliced peptide epitopes (34) are not considered in the current study, this functionality can be added 130 to our method at a later stage. Using NetMHCPan4.0 (35), we identified all 439 9mer and 279 131 10mer epitopes that are predicted to yield positive (classified as both weak and strong) binders. To 132 further validate this peptide set and derive plausible 3D models of the peptide/HLA-A*02:01 133 complexes, we used a structure-guided approach, RosettaMHC, which aims to derive a physically 134 realistic fitness score for each peptide in the HLA-A*02:01 binding groove using an annotated 135 database of high-resolution structures and Rosetta's all-atom energy function (36). RosettaMHC 136 leverages a database of 241 HLA-A*02:01 X-ray structures encompassing a range of bound 137 peptides, to find the closest match to each target epitope predicted from the SARS-CoV-2 138 proteome. To identify the best template for structure modeling, we use matching criteria which 139 first consider the peptide anchors (positions P2 and P9/P10 for 9mer/10mer epitopes), followed by 140 a sequence similarity metric calculated from the alignment between the template and target peptide 141 sequences. The template assignment statistics for the four different classes of SARS-CoV-2 142 epitopes in our set is shown in Figure 2a. Using these criteria, we find that we can cover the entire 143 set of 718 predicted binders using a subset of 114 HLA-A*02:01 templates in our annotated, PDB-144 derived database (Figure 2b). Each target peptide sequence is then threaded onto the backbone of 145 the best identified template, followed by all-atom refinement of the side chain and backbone 146 degrees of freedom using Rosetta's Ref2015 energy function (36).",

High binding energies can be used an additional metric to filter low-affinity peptides 176 in the NetMHCPan4.0 predictions, with the caveat that high energies can be also due to incomplete 177 optimization of the Rosetta energy function as a result of significant deviations between the target 178 and template backbone conformations, not captured by our protocol. We performed 10 179 independent side chain optimization calculations for each peptide, and the 3 lower-energy models 180 were selected as the final ensemble and used to compute an average binding energy.
