While attention is increasingly paid to this model, the origins of development cooperation among developing countries can be traced back to the 1950s. At that time, South\u2013South cooperation was an innovative practice established to foster economic cooperation among developing countries; it was influenced by an international system whose structures were shaped by the logic of the Cold War and growing independence movements in colonized developing countries. The two dynamics had a profound impact on the key rationale of South\u2013South cooperation, primarily founded on the concepts and practices of \u201cinternationalist solidarity\u201d of socialist countries. These countries portrayed South\u2013South cooperation as \u201ca mechanism through which countries of the (developing world) would be enabled to overcome dependence on the industrialized nations\u201d (De la Fontaine and Seifert 2010, p. 2). Whereas South\u2013South cooperation has a long history, it is only in this new millennium that we see an unprecedented upsurge of South\u2013South cooperation on national, regional and global levels, and especially in the realm of global health governance (United Nations Economic and Social Council 2008).",

It is built on relationships between more equal partners with the objective of mutual exchange and development (de Sousa 2010). It therefore presents a viable alternative to the dominant cooperation model that seeks to avoid the same historical mistakes in developing countries and to foster development and thus benefits for all countries involved. Whereas North\u2013South cooperation was primarily founded on the notion of \u201ctechnical assistance\u201d, South\u2013South cooperation is based on the concept of \u00ad\u201ctechnical cooperation\u201d to emphasize the joint effort of integrating partners in a genuine joint operation in which know-how and strategic orientations are shared in order to improve the work capacity and to foster equitable development (Buss 2009).",

The same group agreed to establish the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) at the Belgrade Conference in 1961. Most of the NAM members also formed part of the Group 77 (G77), which was subsequently established in 1964, that actively sought to integrate South\u2013South cooperation into its agenda to \u201cpromote developing countries\u2019 interests in support of a proposed New International Economic Order\u201d (Cabral and Weinstock 2010, p. 24). The call for the revision of the dominant international economic system represented a culmination of the joint efforts of developing countries to overcome economic dependency and inequality that were\u2014in the view of the developing countries\u2014manifested in the Bretton Woods System. With these different Southern alliances, the basic framework for the development of political consensuses between developing countries was established ( Buss and Ferreira 2010). Their agglomerated influence played a critical role in the establishment of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in 1964. Following these developments, the United Nations General Assembly in 1972 initiated a Working Group on Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries (TCDC). In 1978, the United Nations Conference on TCDC, held in Buenos Aires, set another essential landmark in recognizing TCDC as an essential part of South\u2013South cooperation. The Plan provided the conceptual basis and a practical guide for realizing the objectives that TCDC aimed to achieve (SU-SSC-UNDP 2010). Six years later it was institutionally supported by the UN Special Unit for South\u2013South cooperation, whose mandate to this day is \u201cto promote, coordinate and support South\u2013South and triangular cooperation on a Global and United Nations systems-wide basis\u201d (SSC-UNDP 2010). The establishment of this UN division reflected the increasing importance the UN gave to South\u2013South cooperation. In 1987, the NAM convened a summit at which the South Commission was launched and which was later to become famous for its 1990 report \u201cThe Challenge to the South\u201d. This highly cited work assessed the South\u2019s achievements and failings in development and suggested directions for action, in particular with regards to how exactly developing countries could benefit from globalization. The report was critical in trying to establish a more pragmatic view on fostering more development within the South, elaborating how developing countries could in practice benefit from emerging global interdependencies.",

The bulk of Southern actors\u2014particularly a large number of rising states\u2014still claim to respect and apply the Bandung Principles. What has changed is that the early period of South\u2013South cooperation primarily focused on the promotion of economic development, while the policy area of health was at best considered at the margins of Southern development cooperation. However, in but more recent years, approaches to international cooperation in health have evolved. This subsequent integration of policy issues that went beyond the initial primary objective of furthering economic development occurred gradually over time and through the evolutionary establishment of new institutions and/or strategies focusing on specific aspects of South\u2013South cooperation.",

            "text": "The end of the Cold War marked a turning point, not only for collective action in the area of health, but also for South\u2013South cooperation in general. Developing countries\u2019 movements suffered a serious political setback in the context of the end of the bipolar world. A number of developing countries were dealing with financial crises that forced them to approach the Bretton Woods institutions for assistance, \u201cwhich generally came with the conditionality of binding them firmly with the Washington Consensus\u201d (Kumar 2008, p. 2). Developing countries became progressively interwoven into an increasingly complex international system, but in heterogeneous ways. The consequence for the formerly rather united stance of Southern countries, based on common objectives critical of the developed world, was suddenly no longer shared by all developing countries. Yet, despite these substantial changes, the interest of developing countries in engaging in new ways in South\u2013South cooperation was not extinct and was revived with an unprecedented enthusiasm as the dynamics of globalization became apparent in the twenty-first century. The new zeal of Southern countries also captured a vivid interest in development cooperation in areas that previously had been of less interest to these countries. Health now received unprecedented levels of attention in Southern development agendas, a trend that also reflects the power shift of health as it gained recognition as an issue of global concern (Alcazar 2008). Global health, due to its complex character that touches many governance levels and policy fields (e.g. trade, security, development), has been the focus of a plethora of development initiatives. Many of these still follow the traditional logic of the \u201crich\u201d industrialized countries seeking to help the \u201cpoor\u201d developing countries. But this long-standing dichotomy is changing remarkably in today\u2019s world where a considerable number of those countries formerly regarded as \u201cpoor\u201d or \u201cthird world\u201d have become new regional and global centres of power and influence, both economically and politically (see Khanna 2008; Kickbusch 2009; Alexandroff and Cooper 2010). South\u2013South cooperation is reviving to match these geopolitical power shifts, to generate better development outcomes for all the partners involved.",

All these actors from the industrialized countries have been keen to help poor people in \u201crecipient\u201d countries; despite having the best intentions to help poor populations in the poorest countries in the world, very often these actors impose their own world views, agendas and predefined objectives. On the other hand, some developing countries are frequently seen as unable to organize their national demands, given the lack of coordination between Ministries of Health, Foreign Affairs and other key public and private institutions. As a result of both situations, developing countries often suffer from the highly fragmented and ineffective use of the limited resources available (Buss 2007, 2008a, b).",

This range of cooperative tools stands in contrast to traditional South\u2013South cooperation projects in health, which had been mainly driven by ideological reasons (e.g. China, Cuba, Soviet Republic), whose main South\u2013South cooperation activities consisted of the dispatch of medical personnel to developing countries or graduate training of thousands of health professionals (Feinsilver 2008; see Huang 2010). Today we can observe an enlarged scope of development cooperation mechanisms reflecting South\u2013South cooperation of a pragmatic nature, with partners seeking to foster economic, political and social objectives. Currently about 20 % of development assistance from Southern \u00adcontributors\u2014especially from rising states, such as Brazil, China, India, Indonesia or South Africa\u2014has been allocated to the health and education sectors in developing countries (Chahoud 2008; United Nations Economic and Social Council 2008). And yet, although a growth can be observed in the acknowledgement of health within South\u2013South cooperation, it is striking that relatively little literature has been published that specifically focuses on South\u2013South health cooperation. While Brazil has recently published academic articles that sketch out how the country understands and implements its guiding concept of \u201cstructuring cooperation for health\u201d (Buss 2011; Almeida et al. 2010), only a few historical and mostly descriptive narratives have been published that broach the issue of South\u2013South health cooperation (see: Ruger and Ny 2010; Bliss 2010; Huang 2010).",

On the other hand, the academic disciplines with a less emphasis on economics find it hard to work with such confined terms. In the social sciences, the most popular attempt so far has been to define these countries as \u201crising states\u201d. As Alexandroff and Cooper (2010) suggest, the term \u201crising state\u201d does not deny the distinctive economic characteristics of these countries but specifically focuses on socio-\u00adeconomic and political features. Khanna (2008) has offered to define these states as second world countries. This term was formerly used to describe socialist countries during the Cold War, but today\u2019s second world countries are defined by their common hybrid nature, in that they are both, rich and poor, developed and underdeveloped, post-modern and pre-modern, cosmopolitan and tribal, all at the same time. Such conceptualizations account more accurately for the hybrid realities and the countries\u2019 individual experience of self-development, which, these countries suggest, gives them greater insight and legitimacy as partners than countries from the industrialized world.",

To guide the achievement of the strategic objectives set out in the Blueprint, the member states agreed to establish the ASEAN Strategic Framework on Health and Development (2010\u20132015) (Association of South-East Nations 2011). This policy reaffirms ASEAN\u2019s vision of \u201cHealthy ASEAN 2020\u201d adopted at the 5th ASEAN Health Ministers Meeting, which was held in April 2000 in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. It promoted the vision that by 2020 \u201chealth shall be at the centre of development and ASEAN cooperation in health shall be strengthened to ensure that our peoples are healthy in mind and body, and living in harmony in safe environments\u201d (ASEAN 2010). In addition, various ASEAN Working Groups on Health Cooperation have been set up and tailored ASEAN Health Programmes are planned that focus on capacity-building activities, including institutional capacity, laboratories, surveillance, preparedness and rapid response. All these actions are in pursuance of the strategic objectives of health development in ASEAN, including the enhancement of food security and safety, and ensuring access to adequate and affordable healthcare, medical services and medicine, and to promote healthy lifestyles (ASCC Blueprint, 2009: B3, B4).",

Scholarly literature has so far been rather loath to identify and analyse ASEAN\u2019s different policies and instruments of health cooperation. In an academic account on challenges emerging from state sovereignty and its implications for global health governance in Asia, scholars have suggested that \u201cASEAN\u2019s historic strength as a regional organisation lies in its commitment to political stability, which has been informed by the norm of non-interference by member states. Yet this norm is also its inherent weakness when forced to confront threats to public health rooted in poor governance by the organisation\u2019s members\u201d (Stevenson and Cooper 2009, p. 1390).

As a result, the organization covers health amongst a vast range of other issues that fall under these broad objectives. AU-agreements on health include: the Abuja Declaration (2001) calling for its 53 Member States to allocate 15 % their national budgets to health; the Abuja Summit on HIV/AIDS in 2005 to reaffirm that commitment; the AUC Strategic Framework 2005\u20132007, or the Maputo Declaration on Strengthening of Laboratory Systems (2008). One of the recent health milestones has been the Africa Health Strategy 2007\u20132015 that addresses the main challenges faced by African health systems and outlines a broad strategic framework for African nations to achieve the health Millennium Development Goals. it thereby complements existing national and sub-regional strategic documents (African Union 2007). The broader goal of this strategic document is to contribute to Africa\u2019s socio-economic development by improving the health of its people and by ensuring access to essential health care for all Africans, especially the poorest and most marginalized, by 2015. Strengthening the health systems of the African countries is particularly necessitated by the fact that many of their health systems are overwhelmed by the high disease burden and confronted with inadequate human and financial resources. Funding targets both from international assistance and from AU countries themselves are being missed and reflect a long-time priority challenge that was already recognized in the Abuja Declaration 10 years ago, when the importance for AU member states was highlighted to give greater weight to health in the allocation of government revenues (World Health Organization 2010).",

Set out as an explicit development strategy, health was initially not a primary focus of NEPAD.

NEPAD has given unprecedented recognition to the state of health in general and health systems strengthening in particular in relation to overall goals of social and economic development. While this strategic development is admirable, it remains uncertain whether and how the causes of \u00adpoverty and inequity will be addressed by the AU/NEPAD members in the future (see Labont\u00e9 et al. 2004). Despite the numerous pledges and discourses that have emerged around health as a prerequisite to the achievement of sustainable development for Africa, tangible evidence of results is still lacking. Academic research and review is required to examine whether and how AU/NEPAD\u2019s health strategies have produced measurable improvements in health care and health status at country level.",

At that time, the group was known as the South American Community of Nations (CSN), but renamed on April 17, 2007, as UNASUR\u2014the Union of South American Nations.",

For example, one challenge that has been highlighted in a recent publication is: \u201c(t)o further improve Brazilian international cooperation in health, many of its institutions need to be harmonized and a law is needed for international cooperation by the National Congress that can define new concepts and provide mechanisms to improve the country\u2019s international efforts\u201d (Buss 2011). National efforts to address similar barriers in other countries of the region are therefore more important than ever if South\u2013South health cooperation is to succeed in the UNASUR region.",

Rising states such as Brazil, Indonesia or South Africa have been notably active in this trend, while even countries without a current membership status in the most prominent regional organizations have approached such institutions in order to ensure health for its citizens, as the case of China in its closer engagement with ASEAN demonstrates. Many regional institutions have expanded their health agenda to embrace initiatives that go beyond immediate threats to health, promoting for example, structural cooperation for health through better health infrastructures. But many commitments to such initiatives still need to be implemented, so it remains difficult to analyse their impact. While these developments are potentially fundamental to improving health for all, we also observe that to date there has been a lack of active civil society involvement in such initiatives (see Buss and Ferreira 2010).",
