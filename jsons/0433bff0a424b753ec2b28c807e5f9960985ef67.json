Alignment-free techniques such as graphical representations and numerical characterisation (GRANCH) methods have enabled some detailed analyses of large sequences and found a number of different applications in the eukaryotic and prokaryotic domain. In particular, recalling the history of pandemic influenza in brief, we have followed the progress of viral infections such as bird flu of 1997 onwards and determined that the virus can spread conserved over space and time, that influenza virus can undergo fairly conspicuous recombination-like events in segmented genes, that certain segments of the neuraminidase and hemagglutinin surface proteins remain conserved and can be targeted for peptide vaccines. We recount in some detail a few of the representative GRANCH techniques to provide a glimpse of how these methods are used in formulating quantitative sequence descriptors to analyse DNA, RNA and protein sequences to derive meaningful results. Finally, we survey the surveillance techniques with a special reference to how the GRANCH techniques can be used for the purpose and recount the forecasts made of possible metamorphosis of pandemic bird flu to pandemic human infecting agents.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Since the availability of large nucleic acid sequence data in the late 1980s, followed by the subsequent exponential growth of such data in the databases, the need for supportive tools to store, view, retrieve and analyse such sequences became and continues to be of urgent necessity. These tasks require methods to characterise the information contained in these sequences with a view to compare and contrast different sequences to determine their functions and place in the biological domain. The symbolic DNA sequence representation has been the legacy mainstay of such analyses carried over from the oligonucleotide sequence days, falling far short of the requirements of the broad sweeping overview of local and global base distributions, multiple sequence similarities and dissimilarities, molecular evolution and other studies necessary for an overarching assessment of the relationship of any DNA/RNA sequence to the biome through the accumulated data in the nucleic acid databases. Sequence alignment has been the primary tool of choice for such comparison of generic sequences. However, in the conventional methods, the time complexity of sequence alignment varies as~O(l 2 ) for two sequence segments of length l (Kobori and Mizuta 2015) . In the realm of genomic sequences, this clearly consumes an enormous amount of computation time, which grows even worse when multiple alignments are necessary. The reason behind such sequence alignment is the fact that mutational changes in nucleic acid sequences through individual nucleotide mutations and rearrangements in nucleotide distributions brought on by various biological processes are reflected in the DNA/RNA sequences we observe today. This constitutes one of the main considerations facing biologists trying to understand the variations between different sequences of the same genera and their evolution (Qi et al. 2011) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1224, "end": 1248, "text": "(Kobori and Mizuta 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1871, "end": 1887, "text": "(Qi et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Numerical characterisation of the DNA/RNA sequences is one of the main tools in undertaking this task, and a number of methods were developed to analyse specific attributes of DNA sequences. For example, the dot plot (Gibbs and McIntyre 1970) is used to visualise identical sequence segments between two proteins by the diagonal runs in a matrix of the constituents of the two sequences. Needleman and Wunsch (1970) used dynamic programming techniques to align protein or nucleotide sequences; another dynamic programming scheme was later proposed by Smith and Waterman (1981) (Smith et al. 1985) , for improved scoring local sequence alignment, but the computational complexity and time requirements have limited its use. For protein secondary structure prediction, Chou and Fasman (1974a, b) developed an empirical technique, which, however, has been superseded by new machine learning techniques. In particular, dynamic programming techniques that analyse DNA sequences in terms of discrete small segments to eventually merge into the full sequence require time commitments of~O(l k ), where k is the number of sequences to be aligned and is expensive in the use of computing resources, whereas fast Fourier transform (FFT) requiring resource time of~O(l log l) is only slightly better (Hanson, thesis 2003) . Multiple alignment fast Fourier transform (MAFFT) with a simplified scoring system to reduce the computational overhead (Katoh et al. 2002) , discrete Fourier transforms (Yin et al. 2014 ) and wavelet transforms (Dodin et al. 2000) that displays regularity in patterns in DNA sequences have been some of the other methods deployed to extraction of information of interest from the DNA databanks. BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) is one of the most popular search tools for local alignments; it uses a heuristic algorithm that takes shortcuts to identify, very rapidly, sequences in a library that most closely resemble the query sequence (Altschul et al. 1990 (Altschul et al. , 1997 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 217, "end": 242, "text": "(Gibbs and McIntyre 1970)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 388, "end": 415, "text": "Needleman and Wunsch (1970)", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 551, "end": 576, "text": "Smith and Waterman (1981)", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 577, "end": 596, "text": "(Smith et al. 1985)", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 767, "end": 793, "text": "Chou and Fasman (1974a, b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1289, "end": 1310, "text": "(Hanson, thesis 2003)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1433, "end": 1452, "text": "(Katoh et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1483, "end": 1499, "text": "(Yin et al. 2014", "ref_id": "BIBREF115"}, {"start": 1525, "end": 1544, "text": "(Dodin et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1960, "end": 1981, "text": "(Altschul et al. 1990", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1982, "end": 2005, "text": "(Altschul et al. , 1997", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "A more general approach that permits local and global sequence comparisons, generation of phylogenetic trees, numerical characterisations of DNA/RNA/protein sequences, quantitative estimation of sequence divergences and other properties and rational design of peptide vaccines is offered by novel, alignment-free schemes of graphical representation and numerical characterisation of biomolecular sequences (see review Nandy et al. 2006 ). The basic procedure in all these methods is to identify a vector with each type of nucleotide and plot each vector successively until the end of the sequence, thus drawing out a trajectory in the space of the model; associating a numerical value with the curve results in a descriptor of the sequence. This allows for quantitative comparisons between sequences and forms a powerful tool for analysis of similarities and dissimilarities between genes on a local and global scale. These novel approaches dispense with the need for alignments, which, for large sequences, become less reliable due to divergence of species and subsequent rearrangements (e.g. reversal, transposition or block exchange) occurring over evolutionary time scales; corrections introduced to take care of these divergences depend upon significant homologies between the sequences and the genes to be compared and thus become restrictive (Qi et al. 2011) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 418, "end": 435, "text": "Nandy et al. 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 1349, "end": 1365, "text": "(Qi et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "However, as we discuss later, these alignment-free graphical representation methods are not without their problems either.

But on the contrary, the second wave drastically increased mortality rates. A key enigma, genetically, is the occurrence of the three infection waves in rapid succession within a period of 6-12 months: the H1N1 virus had to accumulate immense mutational changes or acquire key genetic alterations for it to become so fatal so rapidly which normally requires years of circulation within a population.

The avian strain was from wild waterfowl found in Eurasia, and the human strain originated from the H1N1 strain that was already present in the population. It is speculated that the surface proteins of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase that had adapted to humans were replaced by those found in the avian strains (Reid et al. 2004 ). The 1957 epidemic, 'Asian influenza', originated in China and resulted in two million deaths caused by the type A H2N2 virus (Pyle 1986 ).

Distribution of the \u03b1-2-3-linked and \u03b1-2-6-linked sialic acid receptors in swine respiratory tract is much more uniform. In contrast, birds have only \u03b1-2-3-linked sialic acid receptor in their respiratory tract. This atypical distribution of sialic-linked glycoprotein receptors in the animal kingdom plays a significant role in evolution and dissemination of the virus. In China and the Far East, where poultry and swine herds are raised in numerous villages and farms, avian influenza with \u03b1-2-3-linked sialic acid receptors can infect swine and develop the ability to bind \u03b1-2-6-linked sialic acid receptors.

Mutational changes in IAV are known to proceed by two well-documented mechanisms, antigenic drift and antigenic shift (CDC 2017b). Antigenic drifts arise out of random point mutations. If they occur in the viral antigenic site, the host cell may lose immunity against the virus, and the infection-immunity response cycle starts all over again. These drifts can cause seasonal outbreaks or epidemics, but they are not potent enough to give rise to pandemics. Antigenic shifts are less recurrent, occurring only when two or more virus subtypes infect a host cell. As the virus has segmented genome, the progeny virus may pack genes from different subtypes in a process known as reassortment.

Drugs used in influenza treatment globally belong to two groups having distinctive pharmacological attributes: M2 ion channel blockers and NA (neuraminidase) inhibitors (Stiver 2003) . M2 protein forms a small proton channel across the viral envelope and mediates pH levels across viral membrane during cell entry and progeny maturation (Pielak and Chou 2011) . It is vital for viral replication, and drugs amantadine and rimantadine were developed to block its function but has since been withdrawn because mutational changes in the prevailing influenzas have rendered them resistant to these drugs (CDC 2011).

Based on global surveillance data generated by WHO's in- It has therefore been a lingering quest to develop a universal flu vaccine that could act against all strains of the virus all the time. There have been claims off and on of a universal flu vaccine, but to date no such vaccine has been marketed. We undertook a graphical and numerical analyses of 514 strains of the H5N1 and 425 strains of the H1N1 influenza virus neuraminidase gene and determined six regions which remained conserved (Ghosh et al. 2010) . This was facilitated by our examination of the graphical representation of the neuraminidase gene sequence which showed a strongly conserved 50/51 base (17 aa) region near the 3 0 end of the gene. When examined in the 3D crystallographic structure of the protein, this region was seen to be responsible for the bonding between the adjacent proteins in the neuraminidase quaternary structure and therefore extremely important for the structure's stability. The other regions we identified as being conserved also turned out to be surface exposed. These observations indicated a possibility, albeit subject to experimental verification, of designing inhibitors for broad-spectrum pandemic control of flu viruses with similar NA structure that could remain active for many generations of mutations of the underlying neuraminidase gene sequences (Ghosh et al. 2010) . In another exercise, we explored the HA protein of H7N9 influenza virus using an improved protocol since there were concerns that the H7N9 could mutate to a human-infecting virus.

The primary goal of precision public health is the accuracy involved in gathering data including emerging pathogens, reactions based on susceptibility and geographical distribution of the diseases. It makes use of real-time data generated, among other computational methods, to gather quick observable data. Traditional methods of forecasting influenza trends by CDC usually lag behind real time by 1-2 weeks, whereas information contained in cloud-based electronic health records and search queries in the Internet are typically available near real time. Yang et al. (2017) combine these cloud-based records and Internet searches with historical flu data and use dynamically selected set of variables to give the best fit in their model for the 2013-2016 flu season. Their results correctly estimated the peak timing and magnitude of the studies of flu season. These kinds of predictive models of influenza activity help public health officials prepare and allocate resources for possible disease outbreaks. However, as with any individual's information, the use of public data calls for discretion: consent, privacy and security must be upheld and protected. Furthermore, an application that has come into prominence is the use of millions of data available from the social media platforms on the World Wide Web. However, the risk of inaccuracy in predictive analysis based on such data is high. A wide margin of error is required to compensate for over-or underestimation. Google Flu Trends, which is the recent surveillance tracking arm of the search engine giant, came into the spotlight for over-calculating the doctor visits for influenza-like illness than the reports generated by CDC which relies on records procured from laboratories (Lazer et al. 2014) . The idea was to correlate search criteria with flu incidence and establish a trend. The initial trials matched 50 million searches with 1152 data points (Ginsberg et al. 2009 ) and came out with erroneous results due to certain ad hoc procedures. Even after corrections to the programmes, GFT persistently overestimated flu prevalence and has been relegated to the background for now in favour of more traditional procedures as adopted, for example, by CDC.
