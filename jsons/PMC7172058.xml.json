            "text": "Prenatal exposure to maternal PD may affect the development of the fetus/infant hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (O\u2019Donnell and Meaney, 2017). Lymphoid organs, and particularly the thymus, display a markedly elevated expression of glucocorticoid receptors during extra-uterine life (Merlot et al., 2008). In transgenic mice with impaired glucocorticoid function, the important role of glucocorticoids in the ontogeny of the immune system has been demonstrated (Saced\u00f3n et al., 1999). In contrast to the traditional view of glucocorticoids as immunosuppressant hormones, they are more accurately conceptualized as immunomodulatory hormones that can both stimulate as well as suppress immune function (McEwen, 2018). If the communication between the HPA axis and immune system is disrupted, for example by prenatal maternal PD, then important alterations in anti-viral immune responses may take place (Bailey et al., 2003; Webster and Sternberg, 2004). Bi-directional communication between the neuroendocrine and immune systems plays a significant regulatory role in response to a viral infection (Bailey et al., 2003). For example, in the general infant population, rhinovirus infections are common, often asymptomatic and do not cause long-term viral persistence in the respiratory tract, while in vulnerable subjects rhinovirus infection-induced wheezing during early life might be a marker for a susceptibility for the later development of asthma (Jackson et al., 2008; Lukkarinen et al.,2017).",

Here, we aimed at bridging and integrating previous data and to investigate whether maternal prenatal PD is associated with the early infant HPA axis reactivity, and whether this association is different in the presence of subclinical rhinovirus infection. We hypothesized that infant HPA axis reactivity is altered after exposure to prenatal PD, and the altered functioning related to this exposure emerges or is especially evident during a concurrent subclinical rhinovirus infection, which can be considered a natural stressor challenging the HPA axis functioning with relevance to the offspring\u2019s later health",

Within the main Cohort, a nested case-control study, called the Focus Cohort, was established to enable comparisons between subjects exposed to different types of prenatal PD with their non-exposed controls (Supplementary Material). To define maternal PD, the questionnaires for symptoms of depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [EPDS]), overall anxiety (Symptom Checklist-90, anxiety scale [SCL-90]) and pregnancy-related anxiety symptoms (Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Questionnaire-Revised 2 [PRAQ-R2]) were used at gwks 14, 24, and 34. Exploratory analyses establishing cut-points for the approximate highest and lowest 25th percentiles of maternal PD during pregnancy were performed. The total sum score cut-off points for the PD exposure and non-exposure were as follows: \u226512 and \u2264 6 for the EPDS, \u226510 and \u2264 4 for the SCL-90 anxiety subscale, and \u2265 34 and \u2264 25 points for PRAQ-R (Karlsson et al., 2018). The criteria to become identified as a case were: 1) scoring at least once above the selected threshold on two different questionnaires, 2) scoring at least twice above the selected threshold on the same instrument at any of the three prenatal time points, or 3) prenatal maternal use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The non-exposed controls needed to remain below the thresholds in all assessments (Karlsson et al., 2018).",

Our hypothesis of HPA axis activity being different in the group of the composite phenotype of PD/rhinovirus+ was tested by comparing the PD/rhinovirus+ group with the average of control/rhinovirus+, PD/rhinovirus- and control/rhinovirus- groups, while controlling for infant sex. The AUCi was lower in PD/rhinovirus + than in the other groups (difference: 14.7 ln [nmol/L] \u00d7 min; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.8\u201325.6; p =  .008) (Fig. 1\na-b). The same comparison was separately tested for boys and girls, and the AUCi difference was significant in boys (p =  .04) but not in girls (p =  .09) (Fig. 1c). Controlling for maternal education level and smoking did not alter results (15.3 ln [nmol/L] \u00d7 min; 95% CI 4.1\u201326.4; p =  .007). Finally, we tested the effect of the rhinovirus status within the PD group. The AUCi was lower in PD/rhinovirus + than in PD/rhinovirus- group (difference: 14.9 ln [nmol/L] \u00d7 min; 95% CI 3.3\u201327.3; p = .01).",

Studies are needed to test whether the observed suppression of HPA axis in the context of rhinovirus infection associates with later disease development, such as atopic disorders and wheezing or asthma (Lukkarinen et al., 2017), and to further investigate child sex in its vulnerability to PD exposure.",
