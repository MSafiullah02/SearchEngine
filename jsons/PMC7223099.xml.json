Causes of TB resurgence are complex and include the emergence and prevalence of drug-resistant strains, low early detection rates, latent infection, poor public health care conditions, and population movements [2, 3]. In 2018, there were more than 1.2 million TB deaths worldwide and an additional 251,000 deaths of TB-HIV co-infection. New TB cases reached 10 million (equivalent to 133 new cases per 100,000), and about 3.4% of new TB cases and 18% of previously treated cases had multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) or rifampicin-resistant TB (RR-TB). Adult male patients accounted for 57% of all new-onset patients, and children younger than 15 years old and those with HIV co-infection accounted for 11% and 8.6% of new-onset patients, respectively [4].",

However, for many countries, the major public health issue of ending TB remains a distant reality. At present, there are an estimated 1.7 billion latent tuberculosis infections (LTBI) worldwide, accounting for about a quarter of the population [8, 9]. Given the increase of population movements and immigration, the need for prevention and control of TB worldwide is becoming more serious.

Timely diagnosis and effective treatment play important roles for controlling the epidemic. In order to reduce incidences of TB in 2030 and 2035 by 80 and 90% compared with levels in 2015, its global incidence will need to decline at an unprecedented rate after 2025. We therefore need new interventions, including shorter, less toxic treatments, improved diagnostics, and more effective vaccines. The TB vaccination is not only the most cost-effective method of controlling the disease but also allows TB outbreaks to be controlled at the source and must be a key component of any strategy to eliminate TB\u2019s global burden [10].",

The early South Indian Chingleput BCG clinical trial failed as most subjects were sensitized by MTB and non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) [27, 28]. In short, BCG is suitable for uninfected people, cannot provide lifelong immunity, and is not suitable for HIV-infected patients and its preventive effect on TB needs to be correctly evaluated.

The target population is healthy adults following BCG vaccination. In a mouse model, a single intranasal immunization using Ad5 Ag85A induced an effective protection against the challenge of MTB, while, compared with an intramuscular injection, Ad5 Ag85A intranasal immunization can significantly enhance BCG\u2019s protective effect [35]. Phase I clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00800670) has evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of Ad5 Ag85A in healthy volunteers who had a history of BCG vaccination and those BCG na\u00efve. Overall, intramuscular vaccination was well tolerated and had good safety and immunogenicity for both groups, while a stronger multifunctional T cell response was observed in those with a history of BCG vaccination [36\u201338]. In September 2017, another phase I clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02337270) is underway to evaluate the safety and immune responses of peripheral blood and lungs after one or two doses of Ad5Ag85A administered by aerosol in healthy volunteers previously immunized with BCG, and the study is expected to be completed on April 2021.",

Researcher found that all dose levels of ID93 and ID93 + GLA-SE were acceptably safe.

At the same time, vaccine doses did not affect the frequency or severity of adverse events, while mild injection-site adverse reactions and flu-like symptoms were common in MTB-infected subjects compared with those not infected with MTB [56].

For unknown reasons, a BCG revaccination or \u201cbooster,\u201d while not toxic, does not provide much additional protection. In 1995, the WHO issued the \u201cGlobal Tuberculosis Program and Global Program on Vaccine: Statement on BCG Revaccination for the Prevention of Tuberculosis,\u201d which concluded that the revaccination effect of BCG could not be confirmed. WHO does not advocate to revaccinate, and it is not necessary to vaccinate anyone for multiple times [94]. After the announcement of the statement, the countries that implemented the BCG revaccination policy stopped the strategy, and China also stopped the revaccination policy of BCG in 1997. At present, only a few countries in the world still implement revaccination strategies, and some even inoculate many times. With the emergence of a large number of MDR-TB and TB-HIV co-infection at the end of the twentieth century, WHO issued another position paper on BCG in 2004 [95]. The position paper states that revaccination of BCG in individuals who are positive for TST (whether or not the positive result is caused by NTM, MTB infection, or BCG vaccination) does not improve its immunity against TB. But, if the TST is negative and inevitably close to MDR-TB, BCG may be considered. However, the 2018 [96] position paper replaces the 2004 WHO position paper on BCG vaccine and the 2007 [97] WHO revised BCG vaccination guidelines for infants at risk for HIV infection. It incorporates recent developments in the TB field, provides revised guidance on the immunization of children infected with HIV, and re-emphasizes the importance of the birth dose. The 2018 position paper shows minimal or no evidence of any additional benefit of repeat BCG vaccination against TB or leprosy. Therefore, revaccination is not recommended even if the TST reaction or result of interferon-\u03b3release assays (IGRA) is negative. In addition, the absence of a BCG scar after vaccination is not indicative of a lack of protection and is not an indication for revaccination. But, BCG vaccination of unvaccinated, TST-negative or IGRA-negative school children is recommended for those coming from or moving to high incidence/burden settings, as well as older groups at risk through occupational exposure.",

Interestingly, Use of an in vitro model of human PBMC induced with a repeat dose of BCG at 24 and 72 h of cell culture demonstrated increased anti-BCG IgG levels in supernatants compared with the pre-boost and control groups [101]. Several human clinical studies have performed an analysis of the effects of BCG revaccination in the HIV-1-uninfected (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02378207 and NCT02075203), BCG-na\u00efve healthy adults (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03175380), and LTBI (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01119521). Now, a phase IIb (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04152161) study of the vaccine by Aeras, in collaboration with partners including the South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative (SATVI) and the Emavundleni Research Centre found that, while BCG revaccination did not demonstrate efficacy in preventing initial MTB infection (defined as QFT conversion at an IFN-\u03b3 level of \u2265 0.35 IU per ml after day 84), it did result in significantly reduced rates of sustained QFT conversion (defined as three consecutive positive QFT results after day 84) [102]. These findings have fuelled renewed interest in the potential utility of BCG revaccination and prompted consideration of BCG revaccination in certain settings as part of an overall improved TB vaccination strategy, although it is not clear to what extent cellular and/or humoral immunity contribute to this protection.",

LLO is a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin that forms a transmembrane \u03b2-barrel-like pore in the phagocytic lysosomal membrane, allowing Listeria monocytogenes to escape to the cytosol [104, 105]. Urease inhibits Phagocytic lysosome maturation and improves the survival of MTB in macrophages [106, 107]. Studies have found that the elimination of urease C promotes phagocytic lysosomal fusion while providing optimal pH for LLO stability [104]. Therefore, expression of LLO in VPM1002 leads to the release of bacterial antigens and DNA into the cytosol, ultimately triggering autophagy and apoptosis [103].",

The clinical evaluation of novel TB vaccines is based on TB incidence in phase III clinical results. Vaccine efficacy is evaluated by comparing the difference in TB incidence between the vaccine and placebo groups. The WHO required novel TB vaccines to have a protective power of at least 50%. Phase I and II clinical trials are a relatively simple means of evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of novel TB vaccines.

However, when clinically evaluating the LTBI adult prophylactic vaccine, immunized subjects were infected with MTB, and sensitization states and immune markers of the body were found to differ from those who were uninfected. A series of immune indicators commonly used to evaluate vaccines for neonates or uninfected individuals have been positive prior to vaccination. Whether changes in these indicators following vaccination can be applied to the clinical evaluation of LTBI anti-vaccination vaccines remains unknown. Therefore, it is even more rare if a standard set of parameters allows accurate comparisons between studies and vaccines to determine whether this is a reproducible in clinical trials.

It would prevent TB by single or several immunizations. However, there is no vaccine that is more protective or sustainable than BCG. While some novel vaccine candidates have achieved certain effects in animal models, how to apply them to humans and whether they can replace BCG still requires a long period of experimentation, follow-up, and demonstration. MVA85A is the first new TB vaccine to receive much attention in the past 90 years. In preclinical animal models, MVA85A was found to significantly enhance BCG immunogenicity priming in guinea pigs, rhesus monkeys, and cattle [148]. Its safety and tolerability have also been validated in phase I and phase IIa clinical trials in healthy adults and TB- and HIV-infected infants, children, and adolescents [40, 149\u2013156]. However, in a phase IIb clinical trial conducted in South Africa in 2013, it was found that healthy infants who had been vaccinated with BCG and immunized with MVA85A did not have additional protection [157]. This result was a great disappointment to both the TB vaccine research community and funders and a call to action for researchers in basic and applied vaccine development. At the same time, this lesson suggests that some of the results obtained in preclinical animal models do not align with results of clinical trials. Therefore, the development of novel TB vaccines continues to face many challenges.Lack of clear protective antigens: MTB has approximately 4000 genes encoding thousands of proteins [158]. The proteins used in TB vaccine design are mainly proliferation-associated antigens (that is, six of the eight subunit vaccines entering clinical studies contain Ag85A or Ag85B proteins). Critical and unresolved questions in TB vaccinology are how to select the best antigens and how many antigen to include in a vaccine. However, limited clinical trial data makes it difficult to support the effectiveness of this antigen or any other single antigen against TB. It is therefore necessary to select more effective antigens to construct a vaccine from the mechanism of MTB infection and so induce more effective protective immunity [159].Lack of credible preclinical evaluation indicators: In early evaluation of immunogenicity, the novel TB vaccine mainly detects specific antibody titers induced by the vaccine, different types of cytokines produced by CD4+ and CD8+, and other T cells following immunization [160]. However, the correlation between these specific immune cells or cytokines in the host\u2019s immune protection against natural TB infection needs further study [161].Lack of suitable vaccine evaluation animal model: Animal experiments have provided evaluation of vaccines in terms of immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy. Mouse models have the advantages of low price, strong viability, and easy access to detection reagents, meaning they are the first choice for the evaluating the preliminary effects of novel vaccines [162]. However, mouse models do not accurately reflect the authenticity of vaccine protection, especially when studying the long-acting immune protection response. Therefore, the use of mouse models to evaluate the effect of novel TB vaccines may result in a deviation from the actual clinical application effect [163]. In addition, evaluation results from the same vaccines in different animal models were inconsistent, with mice and guinea pigs achieving good immunoprotective effects, which failed in non-human primates [164]. Infection and disease manifestations of MTB vary from species to species, and immune response following vaccination is more variable in humans [23]. Therefore, differences between humans and animals may be one of the main factors affecting the predictive ability of animal models.Lack of emulated exposure methods: A significant difference exists in the nature of exposure between animal models and natural human infections. In preclinical animal models, MTB are initially infected by high-dose, single-strain, single exposure through various routes of attack (such as aerosol, tail vein, or intraperitoneal injection). However, in natural conditions, humans often experience multiple low doses, and infections are established following exposure to different strains [165].Lack of a unified clinical trial endpoint criteria: Reducing the incidence of TB and improving the disease status of patients are the main criteria for evaluating TB vaccines. In preclinical animal models, the effectiveness of vaccines tends to be assessed by improvements in organ bacterial counts, histopathological damage, and time of animal death. In contrast, scientists use TB incidence as an end point of human clinical trials. Obviously, there is a fundamental difference and lack of relevance between preclinical trials and clinical trials in determining the endpoint of vaccine effectiveness.Lack of consistent evaluation environment: Unlike in a single laboratory environment, there may be multiple uncertainties in a human clinical test environment, such as diet, nutritional status, NTM, worm co-infection, and host genetic heterogeneity on susceptibility to TB. In contrast, preclinical animal models tend to use specific pathogen-free animals with a consistent genetic background.Immunization population is complicated: When compared with other infectious disease vaccines, a difficulty in researching novel TB vaccines is that the immune status of the vaccination population or infection background is complicated. The widespread vaccination of BCG and NTM infections in countries that have high rates of TB further exacerbates the complexity of vaccination populations. In particular, whether a vaccination with a strong immunogenic vaccine in the LTBI population leads to a Koch response is a safety issue that cannot be ignored. Therefore, those who are BCG na\u00efve, negative, or maintain positive after BCG vaccination and LTBI need to be accurately differentiated and accurately immunized to optimize vaccination effectiveness.",

Novel TB vaccines, which provide effective, sustained protection, have always been an international priority. Especially in recent years, given the advantages of novel vaccine research technology, new methods and ideas for various vaccine research have been established. A large number of different vaccine candidates and their advanced stages in clinical development denote a unique and exciting phase in TB vaccine research. There are also a large number of novel vaccine candidates in preclinical development, including more recently developed vaccine formats such as DNA vaccines, new adjuvants and delivery systems, and combination vaccines. In summary, the development of novel TB vaccines remains mostly focused on the following regimens:Priming vaccine: Developing a new vaccine with longer lasting immunoprotective properties and better protection than BCG to replace the primary vaccination of BCG.Booster vaccine following BCG vaccination: Performing short- or long-term immunization and heterologous or homologous booster to enhance or prolong BCG priming protective effects, improving immunogenicity of BCG, and making up for the shortcomings of BCG long-term effects.Latent infection preventive vaccine: Used to inhibit endogenous re-ignition of infected individuals with MTB while preventing exogenous re-infection.Therapeutic vaccine: As an effective supplement to conventional chemotherapy, which can reduce lesions, promote sputum MTB negative and cavity closure, shorten the course of treatment, consolidate the effect of chemotherapy, and promote the outcome of the disease, effectively treating drug-resistant TB.",

Despite disappointing results from some of the clinical efficacy trials, these experiences are sufficient to remind us to revisit the design and evaluation of TB vaccines. Today, we are witnessing immense progress in both preclinical and clinical TB vaccine research.
