More recently, this measure was successfully used to combat the spread of some emerging and re-emerging human and animal diseases, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], foot-and-mouth disease [9] and the 2009 swine influenza pandemic [10]. Mathematical models have been designed and used to gain qualitative insights into the spread of diseases in the presence of quarantine of individuals suspected of being exposed to a disease, and the subsequent isolation or hospitalization of those with clinical symptoms of the disease (see, for instance, [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]). In the aforementioned models, with the exception of the models in [2], [5], the dynamics of the quarantined susceptible individuals is not explicitly incorporated into the model (the models only count quarantined individuals who are actually latently-infected, and essentially ignore those who remain susceptible at the end of the quarantine period).",

The justification given for this assumption (of ignoring the back-and-forth dynamics of quarantined susceptible individuals: from susceptible to quarantine and back to susceptible class if they show no disease symptoms) is that, in general, the fraction of infected contacts that can be traced and quarantined at the time of infection is very small; and that the total population is large in comparison to the size of the infected individuals [13]. In practice, however, quarantine involves the removal of all individuals suspected of being exposed to a given disease (regardless of infection status) from the rest of the population (this often involves a lot of people; the term mass quarantine is often used to describe this process). Those who show disease symptoms during quarantine are hospitalized (or isolated), and those who remain susceptible at the end of the quarantine period are returned to the susceptible class. It is, therefore, instructive to study the impact of the aforementioned assumption (of not explicitly accounting for the quarantine of susceptible individuals) on the transmission dynamics of a disease that is controllable using quarantine.",

Hence, F is a Lyapunov function on D1.

Hence, it follows from the last equation of the model (8) that, for t>max{M1,M2},R\u02d9\u2264\u03d51\u03d6\u2217+\u03d53\u03d6\u2217\u2212\u03bcR. Thus, by comparison theorem [23], R\u221e=lim supt\u2192\u221eR\u2264\u03d51\u03d6\u2217+\u03d53\u03d6\u2217\u03bc, so that, by letting \u03d6\u2217\u21920,(11)R\u221e=lim supt\u2192\u221eR\u22640. Similarly (by using lim inft\u2192\u221eI(t)=0 and lim inft\u2192\u221eH(t)=0), it can be shown that (12)R\u221e=lim inft\u2192\u221eR\u22650. Thus, it follows from (11), (12) that R\u221e\u22650\u2265R\u221e. Hence, (13)limt\u2192\u221eR(t)=0. Similarly, it can be shown that (14)limt\u2192\u221eS(t)=\u03a0(\u03bc+\u03c81)\u03bc(\u03bc+\u03c81+\u03b3)=S\u2217,limt\u2192\u221eSq(t)=\u03a0\u03b3\u03bc(\u03bc+\u03c81+\u03b3)=Sq\u2217.

A major feature of the model is that it incorporate the dynamics of quarantine-adjusted incidence and the quarantine of susceptible individuals (that is, quarantine is modeled in terms of the temporarily removal of susceptible individuals from the susceptible pool as well as the removal of new infected individuals, detected via the contact tracing of known infectious individuals). Rigorous analysis of the model reveals that it undergoes the phenomenon of backward bifurcation when the associated reproduction number (Rq) is less than unity. The presence of this phenomenon, which does not arise if the quarantine is 100% effective, implies that the effective control of the spread of the disease, using an imperfect quarantine, depends on the initial sizes of the sub-populations of the model (when Rq<1). The model has a unique endemic equilibrium whenever Rq>1. Furthermore, it is shown that the disease will persist in the population whenever Rq>1.",
