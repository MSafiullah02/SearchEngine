However, cost is a concern: the disposable blankets available costs more than UK\u00a315 (\u20ac21; US$20) each and are not recommended for re-use on another patient, the frequency of bacterial contamination tripling after single use [5] . Even if a brand new blanket is used on each patient, the problem is not eliminated. Avidan et al. sampled the air stream from nine forced-air warming units and found potentially pathogenic organisms in four [4] . In another study, heavy growth of bacteria was found in swab samples taken from the exterior and interior of the warming unit and from the distal end of the hose [6] . These studies demonstrate that the hose and the warming units are potential sites for bacterial colonisation, probably due to difficulty in cleaning. This is of particular concern as resistant viruses such as the SARS coronavirus can live on inanimate surfaces for up to 24 h [9] . The electric heating pad used in the current study consists of a warming unit, an electric cable and a heating pad. The heating pad is water sealed and can be disinfected with alcohol or any other disinfectant, as suggested by the manufacturer. There is no hose or hidden space, and theoretically it is easier to clean and disinfect than forcedair warming devices. We found that the electric heating pad was as effective as forced-air warming for maintaining intra-operative body temperature. The drop in mean rectal temperature over the first 30 min of surgery in the forced-air group, from 36.8\u00b0C to 36.6\u00b0C, could be explained by the redistribution of body heat from the core thermal compartment to the distal legs after induction of CSE anaesthesia [10] . The corresponding drop was slightly less in the heating pad group, from 36.9\u00b0C to 36.8\u00b0C. This might be because active warming had already started in the heating pad group once the patients were transferred to the operating table, and continued throughout the performance of the CSE. It is known that prewarming before induction of anaesthesia reduces the coreto-peripheral temperature gradient and reduces redistribution hypothermia [11] . Rectal temperature in the forced-air group gradually increased from its nadir at 115  110  105  100  95  90  85  80  75  70  65  60  55  50  45  40  35  30  25  20  15 min. This gradual increase might be due to persistent vasoconstriction in the upper limbs [10] , making forcedair warming with an upper body blanket relatively less efficient. Rectal temperature was relatively stable in the heating pad group during the first hour of surgery and gradually increased above the baseline thereafter. Another factor to be considered is the body surface area available for warming. The upper body forced-air warming blanket only covered the anterior chest and both arms. The electric heating pad used was 104 cm long and 45 cm wide, resulting in the entire back of the patient being warmed by the pad. In addition, the air under the surgical drape was being warmed, resulting in a tent-like effect.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 89, "end": 92, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 319, "end": 322, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 532, "end": 535, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 700, "end": 703, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 982, "end": 985, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1740, "end": 1744, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2181, "end": 2185, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2446, "end": 2450, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2269, "end": 2355, "text": "115  110  105  100  95  90  85  80  75  70  65  60  55  50  45  40  35  30  25  20  15", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "There are some limitations to our study. First, there was no control group (no active warming) to compare with the two warming strategies. However, we considered this unethical. In addition, we believe that active warming was achieved in both groups, as otherwise we would have expected the temperature drop in the forcedair group to persist for 3 h and the rectal temperature to drop by about 1\u00b0C [10] , whereas in the heating pad group the rectal temperature would have been less stable. Second, there was a difference in the time at which the two warming devices were applied: the heating pad was switched on before the patient was transferred to the operating table, whereas the forced-air warming blanket was applied only after induction of anaesthesia. We are not sure whether the temperature changes might have been different had the forced-air warming started once the patients were transferred to the operating table and been continued throughout the performance of the CSE, but this would be difficult to achieve practically. Third, our study was limited to total knee replacement and we are uncertain whether the results can be extrapolated to other types of surgery. However, our results suggest that active warming with the electric heating pad should at least be considered as an alternative to forced-air warming for maintenance of intra-operative body temperature.
