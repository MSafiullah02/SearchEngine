The endothelial glycocalyx, a layer of negatively charged gel-like substance, exists on surfaces of pulmonary vascular endothelial cells. Heparan sulfate (HS) and syndecan-4 (SDC-4) are highly abundant in the glycocalyx [3, 4]. The endothelial glycocalyx plays an important role in albumin exudation formation, leukocyte adhesion, and anticoagulation [5\u20138]. However, the glycocalyx undergoes dynamic changes and is susceptible to various factors. Enzymes are a key factor in glycocalyx degradation. Glasner et al. [9] reported that heparanase (HPA) and cathepsin L were connected with HS shedding in dengue virus non-structural protein 1-induced endothelial hyperpermeability. Reine et al. [10] reported that matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) was related to the degradation and shedding of SDC-4 in glomerular endothelial cells.",

However, sepsis can induce changes in the deformation ability of neutrophils in pulmonary capillary and their retention on the surfaces of endothelial cells, thereby increasing the capillary permeability of alveoli and inducing and promoting the production of inflammatory cytokines [11]. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1), nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways are important and common inflammatory signaling pathways in lung injury [12\u201314]. Activation of the inflammatory signaling pathways promotes the production and release of high levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory factors. Imbalance in the pro- and anti-inflammatory internal environment of the body leads to damage to vascular cells, cell dysfunction, adhesion or infiltration of inflammatory cells, and hemodynamic changes.",

[27] found that the enzymatic hydrolysis of HS chain can promote SDC-1 shedding in the cell lines CAG, thereby indicating that non-MMP mechanism is also involved in the process of SDC-1 shedding. In the present study, cathepsin L inhibitor did not alleviate LPS-mediated SDC-4 shedding, thereby suggesting that non-MMP mechanisms may not be involved in SDC-4 shedding. More importantly, the inhibition of MMP-9 expression by pretreatment with crocin is closely related to the reduction in SDC-4 shedding, and the inhibition of cathepsin L and HPA expression by pretreatment with crocin is closely related to the reduction in HS shedding.",

As shown in previous reports, crocin had a strong anti-inflammatory effect in diabetic nephropathy model [18]. The results of this study also showed that crocin had the same strong anti-inflammatory effect in LPS-induced ARDS cell and animal models. However, inflammatory injury also induces the production and release of glycocalyx shedding factors (such as MMP-9 and HPA) [30, 31].
