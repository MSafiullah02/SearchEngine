Over the past decades, atypical pneumonia has come to mean lower respiratory tract infections due to specific respiratory pathogens, i.e., Chlamydia psittaci (psittacosis), Francisella tularensis (tularemia), Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Legionella species [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The newly recognised causes of CAP, i.e., severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), hantavirus, and avian influenza, are not considered \u2018atypical pneumonias', but should be regarded as viral CAPs [5, 6].",

The zoonotic atypical pneumonias include psittacosis, Q fever, and tularaemia, and the non-zoonotic atypical pneumonias include Mycoplasma, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella CAPs. Both the zoonotic and non-zoonotic atypical pneumonias differ fundamentally from bacterial CAPs. However, the main feature differentiating atypical from typical CAP pathogens is the presence or absence of extrapulmonary findings. All atypical pulmonary pathogens, both zoonotic and non-zoonotic, cause systemic infectious disease with a pulmonary component, i.e., pneumonia. Pneumonias caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis are typical CAPs with clinical and laboratory findings limited to the lungs. Once this distinction is made in CAP with extrapulmonary findings, the clinician can then determine the characteristic pattern of organ involvement and narrow down the diagnostic possibilities [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].",

If the distinctive patterns of extrapulmonary organ involvement associated with each atypical pathogen are recognised, a presumptive clinical diagnosis is usually straightforward and accurate.

Only rarely have studies used a syndromic diagnosis, and only one has used a weighted syndromic point system of diagnosis. Using a weighted syndromic approach based on the relative clinical specificity of characteristic clinical findings, it is clear that with good sensitivity and specificity, clinicians can not only differentiate typical from atypical pneumonias, but can accurately presumptively diagnose legionnaire's disease [11, 12, 13, 14].",

Typical bacterial pathogens have classically responded to \u03b2-lactam antimicrobial therapy because they have a cell wall amenable to \u03b2-lactam disruption.

In practice, the main clinical problem is to differentiate Legionella from S. pneumoniae and to differentiate Legionella from M. pneumoniae CAP. Based on the characteristic pattern of organ involvement, Legionella patients invariably have several of the following clinical or laboratory features: CNS abnormalities (headache, mental confusion, encephalopathy, lethargy); cardiac abnormalities (relative bradycardia); gastrointestinal manifestations (watery diarrhoea, abdominal pain); hepatic involvement (early or mild transient elevations of the serum transaminases); renal abnormalities (microscopic haematuria, increased creatinine); muscle involvement (elevated CPK and aldolase), and/or electrolyte abnormalities (hypophosphataemia, hyponatraemia). In contrast, the pattern of organ involvement characteristic of M. pneumoniae CAP excludes CNS involvement (except rarely in patients with meningoencephalitis); includes upper respiratory tract involvement (otitis, bullous myringitis, non-exudative pharyngitis); excludes cardiac involvement (no relative bradycardia, rarely myocarditis); includes gastrointestinal involvement (watery diarrhoea but not abdominal pain); excludes hepatic involvement; excludes muscle involvement; includes skin involvement (erythema multiforme); excludes renal involvement (rarely glomerulonephritis); and excludes electrolyte abnormalities. The distinctive laboratory feature of M. pneumoniae CAP is a highly elevated cold agglutinin titre (\u2265 1 : 64) in ~75% of patients. It should be apparent that the most important characteristic features that distinguish Legionella from M. pneumoniae CAP are the presence of CNS, cardiac, hepatic, renal, and electrolyte abnormalities in Legionella infection, none of which are features of M. pneumoniae CAP [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38].",

Serological diagnoses, particularly those based upon IgG titres, are problematic and are fraught with interpretational difficulties. Increased M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae IgG titres in a patient with CAP indicate past exposure and not active or concurrent infection. A patient with pneumococcal pneumonia and elevated IgG titres to M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae does not have co-pathogenicity but rather serological evidence of preexposure in a patient who actively has a single pathogen, i.e., S. pneumoniae [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43].",

            "text": "\nLegionella, among the non-zoonotic atypical pathogens, is the one that is most likely to be misdiagnosed or present as severe CAP. The presumptive diagnosis of legionnaire's disease may be made syndromically if the characteristic pattern of organ involvement of legionnaire's disease is present. As with other infectious diseases, some findings have greater diagnostic significance than others. The clinician should try to distinguish between clinical findings that are compatible with the diagnosis (nonspecific) and those that are characteristic in combination (specific). Some findings, such as mild transient elevations of the serum transaminases, often go unnoticed, or their diagnostic significance is unappreciated in a patient with CAP. Excluding noninfectious causes of mild serum transaminase elevations, and if Q fever and psittacosis can be eliminated on epidemiological grounds, the only non-zoonotic atypical CAP pathogen with mildly elevated transaminases is legionnaire's disease. Neither the diagnosis nor the suspicion of the diagnosis is based upon such a nonspecific finding alone. The mild elevations of the serum transaminases in a patient with CAP are important in the context of accompanying abnormalities, not because such elevations per se are diagnostic. Similarly, an otherwise unexplained borderline low normal or decreased serum phosphorous level in a patient with CAP should suggest the possibility of legionnaire's disease. No other typical or atypical CAP is associated with mild hypophosphataemia. Hyponatraemia, secondary to syndrome of inappropriate ADH(SIADH), may occur because of a variety of pulmonary disorders. Hyponatraemia is more common and severe in legionnaire's disease compared with other CAPs, but hyponatraemia is less diagnostically specific than hypophosphataemia. Without an alternate explanation, microscopic haematuria associated with CAP should also suggest the possibility of legionnaire's disease. Mild increases in serum creatinine which may be elevated due to a variety of other disorders, occur with Legionella. Microscopic haematuria is relatively more important than mild serum creatinine elevations in patients with possible Legionella CAP. Other laboratory tests that suggest Legionella are a highly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) (\u2265 30 units) in patients with CAP and extrapulmonary findings. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is elevated in Legionella but is not helpful diagnostically compared with highly elevated CRP levels. In legionnaire's disease with muscle involvement or rhabdomyolysis, serum aldolase and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels may be elevated. No other CAP with extrapulmonary manifestations is associated with these findings. Patients with legionnaire's disease invariably have some, but not all, of the aforementioned laboratory abnormalities, and the absence of any of them does not mean that the patient does not have legionnaire's disease. As mentioned previously, a highly elevated cold agglutinin titre (\u2265 1 : 64) argues for the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae and strongly against the diagnosis of Legionella or C. pneumoniae [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 39] (Table 2\n).",

            "text": "If psittacosis and Q fever can be ruled out on epidemiological grounds in patients with CAP, relative bradycardia should suggest the possibility of legionnaire's disease. Relative bradycardia cannot be used as a diagnostic criterion in patients with pacemaker-induced rhythms, arrhythmias, or those on \u03b2-blocker medications. Temperature increases the pulse by ten beats/minute/\u00b0F in febrile states, and this relationship defines appropriate pulse/temperature relationships with any given degree of fever > 102\u00b0F. For example, in a patient with a 103\u00b0F temperature, the appropriate pulse response is ~120 beats/minute. In this patient, if relative bradycardia is present, the pulse is \u2264 120 beats per minute and often in the 80\u201390 beats per minute range. Pulse/temperature relationships are not altered by digitalis preparations, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, or ACE inhibitors, but only by \u03b2-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil). Any patient on a \u03b2-blocker who develops a fever will have relative bradycardia. For this reason, clinicians must be wary of incorrectly ascribing relative bradycardia to legionnaire's disease in cardiac patients on \u03b2blockers and fever. Exclusions and criteria aside, relative bradycardia is the most constant and important physical sign in legionnaire's disease. Relative bradycardia may also be associated with psittacosis or Q fever, but is not M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, or typical bacterial CAPs. A rapid way to clinically differentiate M. pneumoniae from Legionella CAP is by the presence or absence of relative bradycardia. Relative bradycardia in a patient with a zoonotic CAP should suggest Q fever or psittacosis but not tularemia. Relative bradycardia strongly favours the diagnosis of legionnaire's disease and effectively rules out M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae from further diagnostic consideration (Table 3, Table 4\n) [37, 38, 44].",

            "text": "\nM. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae CAP closely resemble each other in their clinical manifestations, but have some important distinguishing features. Firstly, M. pneumoniae is an acute infectious disease, while in contrast, C. pneumoniae may be acute but is typically a chronic disease. M. pneumoniae pneumonia, like other atypical pneumonias, is characterised by its pattern of extrapulmonary organ involvement [1, 2]. Mycoplasma has a predilection for the upper, as well as the lower, respiratory tract and thus patients with CAP who have upper respiratory tract involvement are most likely to have M. pneumoniae. Common upper respiratory tract manifestations of M. pneumoniae in a patient with CAP include otitis, bullous myringitis, and mild Non-exudative pharyngitis. These findings are less frequent with C. pneumoniae CAP. The most important clinical finding to differentiate Mycoplasma from C. pneumoniae is the presence or absence of laryngitis. Although all patients with C. pneumoniae CAP do not have laryngitis, the majority of them do. Patients presenting with a \u2018mycoplasma-like illness\u2019 with pneumonia-associated hoarseness should be considered as having C. pneumoniae until proven otherwise. Patients with CAP plus upper respiratory tract involvement and highly elevated cold agglutinin titres, i.e., \u2265 1 : 64, should be considered as having M. pneumoniae CAP until proven otherwise. Neither M. pneumoniae nor C. pneumoniae infection is characterised by cardiac or pulmonary involvement. Gastrointestinal involvement is typical for Mycoplasma, and is much less common with C. pneumoniae pneumonia. In a patient with CAP and otherwise unexplained watery diarrhoea associated with pneumonia, the differential diagnostic possibilities are limited to Legionella and Mycoplasma [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58]. In patients with advanced cardiopulmonary disease and in compromised hosts, M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae CAP may present as severe CAP [59, 60]. C. pneumoniae has been associated with outbreaks in nursing home aquired pneumonia (NHAP) [4, 57, 61].",

            "text": "Atypical pathogens are difficult to culture or dangerous to isolate. For this reason, clinical syndromic diagnosis is essential to increase suspicion of the diagnosis and begin appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy as well as to prompt specific diagnostic testing. Specific diagnostic testing is available for the atypical pathogens causing CAP. Legionella may be rapidly diagnosed by direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining of sputum or respiratory secretions, pleural fluid, or lung specimens. DFA positivity in sputum decreases rapidly after initiation of anti-Legionella therapy. Indirect fluorescent antibody testing (IFA) showing a single titre \u2265 1 : 512 is also diagnostic. Alternately, a four-fold or greater rise in IFA IgG titres between acute and convalescent specimens is also diagnostic of legionnaire's disease. The Legionella antigen test has been useful in increasing Legionella awareness and providing another diagnostic test for L. pneumophila. If the Legionella antigen test is positive, it is (diagnostic of) L. pneumophila (serotype 01), but a negative test does not rule out legionnaire's disease. The Legionella antigen test is negative in non-L. pneumophila species and nonserotype 01 whose frequency depends on geographic distribution. The main advantage of the Legionella antigen test is that it remains positive for weeks to months after the onset of antigenuria, long after clinical resolution of the infection. The main disadvantage of the Legionella antigen test is that it is limited to one species, although L. pneumophila (serotype 01) is the most common Legionella species encountered. It takes several days for antigenuria to develop in the course of legionnaire's disease. If the test is ordered too early, it may be falsely negative as with early serological tests. Legionella may also be cultured on casitone-yeast extract (CYE) agar from sputum or respiratory secretions [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].",

Legionella is an obligate intracellular organism and resides in the alveolar macrophage (AM). The eradication of intracellular pathogens is ordinarily difficult because many antibiotics do not concentrate intracellularly. Fortunately, all agents active against Legionella concentrate in the AM. The efficacy of erythromycin despite its limited anti-Legionella potency may be explained because it concentrates within the AM. Rifampin has anti-Legionella activity in vitro, but clinical experience with rifampin in combination therapy is limited. Rifampin should not be used alone because of the potential for the rapid development of resistance to other organisms. With doxycycline and newer more potent anti-Legionella agents, the rationale for erythromycin plus rifampin combination therapy has essentially been eliminated [5, 15, 61, 62, 66, 67].",

For moderate to severe Legionella CAP, doxycycline should be administered at a dose of 200 mg (IV/PO) every 12 h for 72 h, and then the dose may be decreased to 100 mg (IV/PO) every 12 h for the duration of therapy.

For this reason, pathogens of relatively low virulence, e.g., M. pneumoniae, in a patient with advanced lung disease can present as severe CAP. Of the atypical pathogens, Legionella is most likely to present as severe CAP requiring hospitalisation and ICU admission. Therapy of severe CAP is usually initiated intravenously, and after clinical defervescence, therapy may be switched to an oral equivalent [86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93].",

C. pneumoniae has been shown to cause outbreaks in patients in chronic care facilities and this has not been the case with M. pneumoniae. Both M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae CAP are most common in the ambulatory setting in young adults, but are responsible for a small number of patients who are hospitalised with CAP. M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae may present in patients with severely compromised respiratory function as severe CAP. M. pneumoniae, and to a lesser extent C. pneumoniae, may precipitate an attack of asthma or exacerbate existing asthma. Some patients who have recently had M. pneumoniae CAP develop post-CAP asthma which may be permanent. It would seem that M. pneumoniae which resides on the surface of the respiratory epithelium is in a perfect position to cause bronchial or hyper-reactivities and/or bronchospasm. The treatment of M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae CAP is important, not because of the severity of the illness, but if for no other reason, to decrease communicability and to decrease post-CAP asthma [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 94, 95].",

Researchers at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine have used PCR and sophisticated diagnostic techniques to diagnose Chlamydia pneumoniae in patients with MS. They have achieved very good results, even in patients with far advanced MS, using prolonged anti-C. pneumoniae treatment. The role of C. pneumoniae in coronary artery disease remains controversial. Some trials have been conducted to evaluate the prophylactic value of antichlamydial prophylaxis in the prevention of CAD, but these studies have been inconclusive. Future studies will determine the role of C. pneumoniae in CAP and MS as well as other chronic infectious diseases [80, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100].",
