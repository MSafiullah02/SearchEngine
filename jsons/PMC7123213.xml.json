The conceptual translations of most of these eORFs produce novel proteins with no definitive homology to proteins with known functions (Peterson-Burch et al. 2000; Wicker and Keller 2007; Grandbastien 2008; Steinbauerov\u00e1 et al. 2012), nor have protein products from these eORFs been isolated, let alone functionally assayed. In most cases, these regions are found between pol and the 3\u2032 LTR (3\u2032 eORFs) (Fig. 6.1), but there are several exceptions (Steinbauerov\u00e1 et al. 2012). Members of the Ogre lineage, best characterized in legumes, possess conserved, intact 5\u2032 eORFs between the 5\u2032 LTR and gag (Fig. 6.1) (Neumann et al. 2003; Macas and Neumann 2007; Steinbauerov\u00e1 et al. 2012).\n",

It is doubtful these host genes played any functional role, and these elements will not be addressed here. Interestingly, Steinbauerov\u00e1 et al. (2012) reported partial sequence similarities in eORFs to the plant mobile domain, a member of a group of conserved zinc finger motifs found in a large superfamily of eukaryotic transcription factors and shown to be associated with MULE transposases (Babu et al. 2006). These similarities were found within 5\u2032 eORFs or 3\u2032 eORFs in a single clade of Ty3/Gypsy elements that included the Ogre family. Finally, the DIRS-1 retrotransposon family is characterized by a domain encoding a tyrosine recombinase at the 3\u2032 end of pol (Poulter and Goodwin 2005; Wicker and Keller 2007), but no representatives have been found in plants (Pied\u00f6el et al. 2011).",

What that role or roles may be is open to speculation, but for reasons that will be discussed below, many of these eORFs were described as \u201cenvelope-like\u201d based on varying degrees of predicted secondary structure similarity of their conceptual translation products to viral envelope proteins (Laten et al. 1998; Peterson-Burch et al. 2000; Vicient et al. 2001; Wright and Voytas 2002; Boeke et al. 2005b; Holligan et al. 2006; Hafez et al. 2009; Laten and Bousios 2012). By extension, it has been suggested that these retrotransposon families are analogous to animal endogenous retroviruses (Kumar 1998; Laten et al. 1998; Peterson-Burch et al. 2000; Wright and Voytas 2002), the integrated vestiges of ancient infectious retroviruses.",

For mammalian retroviruses and endogenous retroviruses, even in cases where clear evolutionary relationships are inferred from phylogenetic trees based on RT alignments, the corresponding envelope sequences may have diverged to the extent that homology cannot be deduced from global sequence-based analyses (Benit et al. 2001). However, by restricting multi-sequence alignments to transmembrane subunits, homology has been inferred across retroviral genomes and those of other enveloped viruses, such as Ebola and Marburg, with Class I fusion proteins (Benit et al. 2001). Although not addressed by Benit et al. (2001), the observed localized sequence similarities could have been the result of convergent evolution or localized domain capture.",

However, some murine ERVs are far more active (Maksakova et al. 2006). In most ERV families, the envelope gene sequences are riddled with nonsense mutations and deletions. It has been suggested that most, but not all, vertebrate multi-copy ERV families arose by short bursts of multiple germ-line infections, not by retrotransposition (Belshaw et al. 2004; Bannert and Kurth 2006; Jern and Coffin 2008). While there is no evidence for recent retrotransposition of human ERVs, mobilization of ERVs in other mammals has been reported (Maksakova et al. 2006, 2008; Ribet et al. 2007; Stocking and Kozak 2008; Zhang et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2010), and the expression of ERV mRNA and production of proteins in somatic tissue has been associated with some cancers (Moyes et al. 2007; Howard et al. 2008; Maksakova et al. 2008).",

Nearly all copies have inserted into their present genomic positions in the last 750,000 years, with as many as 10% having done so in the last 30,000 (Du et al. 2010b; Bousios et al. 2012b). SIRE1 has been designated as the Type Species for the Genus Sirevirus (Boeke et al. 2005b), and based on reverse transcriptase sequences constitutes a monophyletic group within the Ty1/Copia superfamily (Boeke et al. 2005b; Du et al. 2010b; Bousios et al. 2012a). This group has been alternatively designated as the Maximus lineage (Du et al. 2010b) or the Sirevirus lineage (Bousios et al. 2012a). Not all members of the lineage contain 3\u2032 eORFs that encode hypothetical proteins with ENV-like features (Havecker et al. 2005; Pearce 2007; Bousios et al. 2010, 2012a, b), but those that do have been found in the genomes of most eudicots and monocots for which extensive sequence data are available (see Table 6.1). Many of the hypothetical proteins are truncated or heavily mutated and have not been annotated. The initial recognition and discovery of some of these 3\u2032 eORFs required tBLASTn searches of nucleotide databases using previously reported ENV-like proteins as queries (Laten 1999; Havecker et al. 2005; Wicker and Keller 2007; Du et al. 2010b; Laten and Bousios 2012).",

Weaker sequence similarity corresponding to the first 300 amino acids of the SIRE1 ENV-like hypothetical protein has only been detected in short regions of the related elements in L. japonicus (Laten, unpublished). Additional members of the same lineage, based on their RT sequences, possess several hundred bp between the pol stop codon and the 3\u2032LTR, including PREM-2, Opie-2, and most members of the Ji lineage from maize, and Osr7 and Osr8 from rice.

While the species in these genera contain Sirevirus-like sequences with at least fragments of homologous env-like ORFs, fully intact env-like ORFs have not been reported. The relative youth of the apparently functional copies of the Sireviruses in G. max and L. japonicus suggests that significant amplification of one or a few ancestral copies with preexisting intact env-like ORFs occurred over the last few hundreds of thousands of years, with integration of some copies of diverged sub-lineages within the last tens of thousands years (Laten et al. 2003; Holligan et al. 2006; Du et al. 2010b).

Furthermore, RT-PCR amplification from several tissues with 3\u2032 eORF-specific primers suggested that Bagy-2 is transcribed and that transcripts are spliced (Vicient et al. 2001). In addition, insertional polymorphisms among a number of related barley cultivars suggested that Bagy-2 copies have recently transposed (Vicient et al. 2001). A consensus sequence for a closely related element with an ENV-like hypothetical protein in rice, Rigy-2, was generated from an alignment of four copies interrupted by other nested elements (Fig. 6.6). The 3\u2032 eORFs in the Rigy-2 consensus sequence contained both nonsense and frameshift mutations (Vicient et al. 2001). Related elements have also been reported in cultivated allotetraploid cotton and their diploid progenitors, and the hypothetical ENV-like proteins are strongly predicted to possess transmembrane domains (Hafez et al. 2009).\n",

However, there is a family of soybean elements within the Ogre lineage that, despite its close evolutionary relationship to other legume Ogre families that have no detectable env-like coding regions (Neumann et al. 2003; Macas and Neumann 2007), possesses an env-like 3\u2032 eORF. GmOgre/SNARE is a family from G. max that shares the unusual features of Ogre lineage members\u2014a conserved, intact 5\u2032 eORF upstream of gag, a conserved intron in pol, and a minisatellite repeat region adjacent to the 3\u2032-LTR (Laten et al. 2009; Du et al. 2010a). It is the most abundant transposon family in the soybean genome (Du et al. 2010b). But unlike all other members of the Ogre lineage, a GmOgre/SNARE consensus sequence from the end of pol to the minisatellite repeats contains an intact, 425-codon ORF whose conceptual translation generates a hypothetical protein with patches of significant similarity to the ENV-like hypothetical proteins from Cyclops-2 and Endovir1 (Laten et al. 2009). tBLASTn searches identified homologous coding regions in M. truncatula and L. japonicus in disrupted ORFs (Laten et al. 2009). What makes the GmOgre/SNARE ENV protein especially intriguing is the fact that Cyclops-2 is a member of the Ty3/Gypsy superfamily and Endovir1 is a member of the Ty1/Copia superfamily. This suggests that the ENV-like protein in GmOgre/SNARE may be a chimera. Du et al. (2010a) suggested that the GmOgre/SNARE env-like region represents a relatively recent capture event, but it also may reflect the maintenance of selective pressure in the G. max lineage and the relaxation of this pressure in the other lineages.",

Nor have these sequences been shown unequivocally to be homologous to any other characterized genes in plant or viral genomes. Nonetheless, it has been proposed and widely presumed that env-like coding regions were independently acquired or captured (from an unknown source or sources) by ancestral Ty1/Copia and/or Ty3/Gypsy retrotransposons (Peterson-Burch et al. 2000; Du et al. 2010b). The putative chimeric env-like region or GmOgre/SNARE might represent a more recent fusion event (Laten et al. 2009; Du et al. 2010b). A less likely but not inconceivable scenario is the possibility that some and perhaps many retrotransposons are actually the descendants of ancient enveloped retroviruses (Eickbush and Jamburuthugoda 2008) and that genomes, including those of plants (Yano et al. 2005), have recorded the history of the demise of env genes.",

(2010b) created a neighbor joining tree linking sequences from plant Ty1/Copia and Ty3/Gypsy retroelements rooted to the Drosophila 17.6 ENV protein (Fig. 6.8). Conservation of ENV sequences between the superfamilies in the alignment is limited to a small number of identical residues and a larger number that are similar. But these similarities could also reflect convergent evolution and not evolutionary homology. Nonetheless, assuming homology, the Ty1/Copia sequences appeared to be monophyletic but the Ty3/Gypsy sequences were not. Instead, one clade of ENV sequences from Ty3/Gypsy elements in soybean, Lotus, and Medicago was the sister group to a subset of ENV sequences associated with elements belonging to the Ty1/Copia superfamily. The neighbor joining trees of the corresponding RT sequences did not generate this tree topology and conformed to the expected segregation of all members of the two superfamilies into two sister clades (Du et al. 2010b). The authors inferred that the Ty1/Copia env-like gene was acquired from an ancestral member of its sister Ty3/Gypsy clade, long after the capture of the env-like sequence by an ancestral Ty3/Gypsy retrotransposon near the crown of the tree (Fig. 6.8). However, this conclusion was based, in part, on the questionable rooting of the tree to the ENV sequence of a Drosophila element. Removal of the root generates an unrooted tree whose topology leaves open the question of the origin of the ENV sequences.\n",

However, it seems unlikely that the expression of an env-like ORF was essential to the proliferation of most families in the Athila and Tat clades, although traces of their widespread distribution suggests an important function, even if that function was transient. The presence of highly conserved, intact env-like ORFs in the hundreds of copies of Sireviruses in G. max and L. japonicus could be due to strong selection or to their recent explosive amplification. One can only speculate whether those env-like genes that appear to have retained function are the products of continuing, lineage-specific, purifying selection, or resurrected Phoenixes that have emerged from the ashes of degenerate copies by a variety of mutational processes.",

Most plant viruses are transmitted by insect vectors in which the viruses do not propagate in their insect hosts (Lazarowitz 2007). But in the case of a few, the viruses also infect the cells of their hosts (propagative viruses) and could just as well be considered animal viruses (Lazarowitz 2007). This latter group includes members of two families of enveloped viruses: Rhabdoviridae and Bunyaviridae. The former includes Sonchus Yellow Net Virus (SYNV) that generates a virion composed of a lipid envelope embedded with virally encoded glycoproteins, while the latter includes tospoviruses like Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus (TSWV) with a genome that encodes two envelope glycoproteins (Lazarowitz 2007; Whitfield et al. 2005). In their plant hosts, intracellular SYNV and TSWV particles appear to associate with the nuclear and ER membranes, respectively (Lazarowitz 2007). In the case of TSWV single-enveloped particles are formed and transferred to feeding thrips (Kikkert et al. 1999). In thrip hosts, TSWV virions are associated with the plasma membrane and are released from infected cells by fusion with the cell membrane (Whitfield et al. 2005). However, there are no reports of detected homology between any plant retroelement ENV-like hypothetical protein and those of plant enveloped viruses.",

            "text": "The maintenance of envelope-encoding sequences in these viruses appears to be directly related to infectivity in their animal hosts, not in their plant hosts. When maintained solely by serial mechanical inoculations from one infected plant to another, non-enveloped mutant isolates accumulate (Goldbach and Peters 1996). These isolates are fully capable of mounting a systemic infection in plants after mechanical transfer (Goldbach and Peters 1996). However, non-enveloped isolates with mutations in the glycoprotein genes have been shown to be incapable of reinfecting the thrip host (Nagata et al. 2000). These observations provide an attractive, albeit highly speculative, model for the existence of endogenous retrovirus lineages in plants with nonfunctional and functional env-like genes. Confirming this model would require at a minimum the discovery of related elements in invertebrate vectors and demonstrating that virions from plants could fuse with the plasma membranes of the invertebrate host. Attempts to detect SIRE1 using PCR amplification in several known vectors including several species of thrips and aphids were unsuccessful (Laten, unpublished). Nor have tBLASTn or BLASTn searches of the Genbank database retrieved any animal DNA or mRNA with significant similarity to plant env-like genes. (Laten, unpublished).",

Regardless of whether or not transcripts, spliced or otherwise, represent functional expression, no reports of protein products have been published, let alone the results of functional assays. Potentially functional ENV-like proteins need to be isolated, either from plant tissue or from cloned constructs. Assays need to be developed and optimized for the evaluation of not only putative functions, e.g., membrane fusion, but also for alternative functions. Viral envelope proteins are just one of the many classes of proteins characterized by transmembrane and/or coiled coil domains, although the model set by the structure and evolution of animal endogenous retroviruses has greatly influenced the annotations of these elements. Continuing to annotate as \u201cenv-like\u201d 3\u2032 eORFs whose conceptual translations produce hypothetical proteins with transmembrane domains seems ill-advised at the present time, and the question of the existence of plant retroviruses, endogenous or infectious, remains unanswered. Function notwithstanding, the env-like genes in plant genomes are arguably the most abundant protein coding regions in the genomes of higher plants for which no function has been determined.",
