The SARS-CoV genome encodes a chymotrypsin-like cysteine proteinase (CCP, also known as Mpro or 3CLpro) that proteolytically processes polypeptides required for viral replication and transcription,14 representing an ideal drug target for treating SARS. Although small-molecule inhibitors of CCP have been identified,15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 the development of these inhibitors as clinical drugs for treating SARS has not yet been achieved. New inhibitor leads of CCP are still highly desirable.",

This model suggests that the potency of CS11 can be improved by minor structural modifications. For example, replacing the 4-aminobenzoic acid moiety of CS11 by a 4-amino-3-methylbenzoic acid would better mimic the side chain of ValP4. CS11 is easy to synthesize and derivatize, and it is therefore an excellent inhibitor lead of CCP.",

Further, the respective numbers of potential inhibitors (472 and 181) identified from the screens using the bound and unbound crystal structures are much smaller than the number (3958) identified using the computer model.

The flexible loop was not determined in the crystal structure solved at a resolution of 1.9 \u00c5 (PDB code: 1Q2W). In the bound and unbound crystal structures solved at resolutions of 2.5 and 2.2 \u00c5, respectively, the flexible loop was determined with relatively low real-space correlation coefficients for residues 45\u201348 (PDB codes: 1UK4 and 1UK2).3 In the two crystal structures, the main-chain conformation of the flexible loop pushes Met49 towards His41 which in turn forces Gln189 to block the space above Asp187 and His41 in the active site, whereas the main-chain conformation of the flexible loop in the 4.0-ns model moves both Met49 and Gln189 away from His41 and thus removes the blockage of Gln189 seen in the crystal structures (Fig. 3\n). Although a flexible docking algorithm can adjust the receptor conformation to accommodate the docked ligand, there has been no literature report that it can adequately adjust the main-chain conformation of the receptor for complexation.",

The 2.0-ns average structure was purposefully contracted by omitting root-mean-square fit in averaging instantaneous structures. Consequently, relative to all atoms of residues 14\u2013180 in the 4.0-ns model of CCP, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the 2.0-ns model (1.11 \u00c5) is smaller than those of the bound (2.38 \u00c5) and unbound (2.39 \u00c5) crystal structures.",

In this study, the 3D model of CCP was predicted from the genome in 20 days and an excellent inhibitor lead for CCP was identified by virtual screening in 9 days at the Computer-Aided Molecular Design Laboratory (CAMDL) of the Mayo Clinic. This lead was obtained from a chemical vendor in 30 days and assayed for SARS-CoV inhibition in 3 days at the Southern Research Institute. The 2-month drug-lead identification from the SARS-CoV genome can be shortened to 1 month by the 3.4 teraflops computing resource available at CAMDL in 2005 and to even a shorter process with petascale computing in the near future. All the results presented herein suggest that the genome-to-drug-lead approach can broaden the utilization of genetic information in drug discovery and open a fast track to therapeutics to combat emerging viruses such as SARS-CoV and the highly pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) virus (Bird Flu).",
