            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus named as SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which led to thousands of infected patients and hundreds of deaths [1], [2], [3]. To date, there is no effective drug to prevent or treat SARS. In addition, there is possibility of reintroduction of a SARS-like coronavirus into humans and the risk of an escape of SARS-CoV from laboratories [4], [5]. Although the outbreaks seem to be over, SARS remains safety concerns [6], [7]. SARS-CoV has been isolated and its genome sequenced [8], [9]. SARS-CoV is a positive-sense RNA virus that consists of four main structural proteins: spike protein (S), membrane protein (M), envelope protein (E) and nucleocapsid protein (N). S protein is a major structural glycoprotein of SARS-CoV responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion [10]. It has been reported that vaccines based on the S protein seem to provide protection via an inhibition of viral replication after challenge with live SARS-CoV [11]. In addition, the cell-mediated response induced by S protein also plays a very important role in eliminating virus. We have demonstrated previously that after immunization with SARS-CoV S DNA vaccine, cellular immunity was induced by the evidence of high frequencies of IFN-\u03b3 producing effector/memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in mice [12]. Hence, S protein is a major target for developing anti-SARS drugs or vaccines.",

            "text": "Evidence suggests that cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTLs) play a pivotal role in the elimination of virus particles during infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) acute infection [13], [14]. And to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, CTLs not only contribute to virus elimination, but also induce immunopathology [15], [16]. Excited to us, we found that SARS-CoV S specific CTL responses were detected in patients who had recovered from SARS and mouse model [17], [18]. Therefore, CTLs may determine the role of immunity in controlling viral pathogenesis. Human CTLs are specific for peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. HLA-A*0201 is expressed as 39\u201346% of all major ethnicities [19], and furthermore HLA class I alleles have been reported to correlate with SARS susceptibility [20]. Recently, five S protein-derived CTL epitopes S1042\u20131050, S787\u2013795, S1167\u20131175, S958\u2013966 and S411\u2013420 were identified by some groups [21], [22], [23], [24]. They have screened HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides which may be appropriate vaccine candidates. However, phenotypic characteristics and functions of the CTLs induced by those HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides remain undefined, and their distributions in different organs are still unknown. In this study, the CD8+ T cell responses induced by HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides were evaluated in draining lymph nodes, spleens and lungs from HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice vaccinated by SARS-CoV S DNA prime and HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides boost strategy. The functionalities and characteristics of the cognate peptides induced CD8+ T cell response were analyzed. Our data confirmed previous reports and demonstrated that numerous powerful peptide-specific CD8+ T cells that represented a memory subset with CD45RBhigh and CD62Llow were elicited by HLA-A*0201-restricted peptides both in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. These peptide-specific CD8+ T cells were persisted for over a long period of time, suggesting their long-term protective effect in vivo. These data provide novel information of antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses in detail, which could be used for design of effective vaccine against SARS-CoV infection in humans.",

The cells were stimulated with or without peptide-loaded DCs to assess HLA-A*0201 restricted peptide-specific immune responses. The levels of IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-2 in the cell-free culture supernatants were determined by ELISA. The results revealed that very low levels of IFN-\u03b3 were detected when lymphocytes were cultured in medium alone. Interestingly, addition of peptide-loaded DCs to cell culture systems markedly enhanced the production of IFN-\u03b3 in all of the organs from DNA plus peptides immunized mice (Fig. 1A). There is only modest IFN-\u03b3 production in splenocytes from DNA alone immunized mice (P\n < 0.01) and the levels of IFN-\u03b3 in PBS control groups were undetectable. Besides, there were TNF-\u03b1 and IL-2 produced by lymphocytes from Tg mice immunized with SARS S DNA and HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides following cognate peptide stimulation in vitro. The results showed that the highest level of TNF-\u03b1 was detected in lungs which were non-lymphoid tissues (P\n < 0.05). The production of IL-2 in spleens (P\n < 0.001) and lymph nodes (P\n < 0.05) was little stronger than it in lungs (Fig. 1B).

To illuminate this question, splenocytes from prime-boost immunized mice were stimulated in vitro with or without peptide-loaded DCs in the same way as above. The CTL related intracellular cytokines were stained with anti-IFN-\u03b3, anti-TNF-\u03b1, anti-IL-2 and isotope controls. Results showed that HLA-A*0201 restricted peptide-specific CTLs could simultaneously produce several kinds of cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-2 (Fig. 4A). Further analysis of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 expression demonstrated that peptide-specific CTLs could be divided into three distinct subpopulations, including IFN-\u03b3+ TNF-\u03b1+ cells, IFN-\u03b3+ cells and TNF-\u03b1+ cells. Most cells expressed both IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, and only small subsets of the cells expressed either IFN-\u03b3 or TNF-\u03b1 alone (Fig. 4A and B). In the same experiment, the expression of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 presented the same phenomenon in peptide-specific CTLs which could be separated into IFN-\u03b3+IL-2+ double positive subset, IFN-\u03b3+ single positive and IL-2+ single positive subsets. Differently the mainly subset was composed by IFN-\u03b3+ single positive cells, only a small population of the IFN-\u03b3+IL-2+CD8+ T cells could be detected and very few IL-2+CD8+ T cells were observed (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these results indicated that HLA-A*0201 restricted peptide-specific CTLs elicited in vivo can produce several kinds of cytokines following peptides stimulation, suggesting that the CTLs may have effective function in protecting body against infection.",

Cells were first gated on CD8+ T cells and the phenotype of IFN-\u03b3+CD8+ T cells was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 5\n, nearly 89% of IFN-\u03b3+CD8+ T cells expressed CD45RBhigh and approximately 84% subset was CD62Llow. Although most IFN-\u03b3 producing cells were CD45RBhighCD62Llow cells, a variable fraction (mean value 16%) of the IFN-\u03b3+CD8+ T cells expressed high level of CD62L which were considered as typical central memory CD8+ T cells [32], [33]. Thus, on basis of IFN-\u03b3 producing cells, a population of peptide-specific CD8+ T cells that have characteristics of memory T cells has been identified in this study.

Evidence suggests that FACS assay measures the exposure of CD107a/b onto the cell surface as a result of degranulation, presenting in the membrane of cytotoxic granules [34]. We observed a reciprocal expression of surface CD107a/b which may be due to granzyme depletion in cells having undergone recent granule exocytosis. In this study, surface expression of CD107a/b was enriched in CD8+ T cells stimulated by peptides in vitro, over the population of CD8+ T cells without peptides stimulation (Fig. 6\n). In the same time the expression of IFN-\u03b3 or TNF-\u03b1 by CD8+ T cells was determined and results showed that a small part of cells co-expressed CD107a/b with IFN-\u03b3 or TNF-\u03b1, suggesting the diversity of antigen-specific T cells.

The data showed that persistent peptide-specific memory CD8+ T cells which could secrete IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 following cognate peptides stimulation still could be detected in spleens, though one month has pasted since the boost vaccination. The frequency of IFN-\u03b3+CD8+ T (mean value 0.23%) cells and TNF-\u03b1+CD8+ T cells (mean value 0.29%) from stimulated splenocytes were 5.6- and 5.7-folds higher than cells cultured in medium alone, respectively. Similar results were also obtained for peptide-specific CD8+ T cells co-expressing IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 which possessed great percentages, suggesting the strong ability of peptide-specific CD8+ T cell induced by SARS S HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides. In addition, based on IFN-\u03b3 production the phenotype of these long-lived peptide-specific CD8+ T cells were characterized with surface marker CD45 and CD62L, and the majority of IFN-\u03b3+CD8+ T cells were CD45high and CD62Llow. These constellations of findings make us believe that these peptide-specific CD8+ T cells induced by prime-boost vaccination will be quickly conscripted into effector populations to protect body during reinfection (Fig. 8\n).",

In this study, the properties of immune responses of CTLs which were induced by SARS S HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides in vaccinated HLA-A*0201 Tg mice were explored.

An understanding of the immunology of coronavirus infections in mice and swine indicated that, of the large number of potential vaccine antigens encoded by the SARS-CoV genome, S glycoprotein would be the best [37]. Recent work has shed light on the important role of S protein in inducing effective cellular immune responses and humoral responses both in mice [12], [25] and humans [17]. In our previous studies, we have demonstrated that prime-boost vaccination of mice with SARS-CoV S DNA vaccine induced remarkable antigen-specific cellular and humoral immune responses in response to a pool of entire overlapping S peptides [12]. In view of the advantages of polypeptide vaccine, many teams are trying to identify SARS S epitopes to provide optimum candidates for vaccine development. We have identified two novel epitopes which could induce antigen-specific CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell immune responses in BABL/C mice, respectively [18]. However, it is known that the ultimate purpose of scientific research is used by human beings. Although many antigen-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes in SARS-CoV had been identified in animal models, it is not appropriated to directly apply them to the human vaccine. So identification of functional dominant CD8+ T cell epitopes in SARS-CoV S protein for human is crucial. Excited to us is that several HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides from SARS S protein have been screened by some groups currently [21], [22], [23], [24]. However, the mechanisms and properties of immune responses induced by these epitopes are still not well understood. In present study, we verified their results and determined the functions and features of peptide-specific CD8+ T cells elicited by these HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides.",

In addition to IFN-\u03b3, these antigen-stimulated CD8+ T cells acquire antiviral effector functions, such as the ability to produce TNF-\u03b1. TNF-\u03b1 that has important effect role in activating macrophages, inducing apoptosis of infected cells and contributing to granuloma formation. IL-2 has little direct effect function but is an indicator of cells with higher capacity for survival and proliferation that can later evolve effect responses. Although peptide-specific CD8+ T cells from both lymph nodes and spleens could produce IL-2 upon peptides stimulation, the level of IL-2 in lungs was under detectable. As we know antigen-specific CD8+ T cells become exhausted by loss of a subset of effect functions and IL-2 production appears most sensitive to inactivation, followed by TNF-\u03b1 synthesis, while IFN-\u03b3 production appears more resistant to this early functional loss [33]. To say in other words, CD8+ T cells producing IL-2 are also more likely to differentiate into memory cells, and CD8+ T cells producing only IFN-\u03b3 tend to be short-lived. Thus, we presumed that antigen-activated CD8+ T cells that migrate from lymphoid tissues to lungs which belong to effect organ were short-lived, while most memory CD8+ T cells reside in the lymphoid tissues.",

CD107a and CD107b are two intracellular proteins that are normally found in lysosome, but are also a structural component of cytotoxic granules. Acquisition of cell surface CD107a/b is associated with loss of intracellular perforin, indicating that exposure of CD107a/b to the cell surface is dependent on degranulation. Following exocytosis of cytotoxic granules, CD107a/b is transiently expressed on the cell surface of CTLs [38], [39]. Thus, the expression of CD107a/b can actually reflect the cytotoxic ability of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells [34]. Kamath et al. [38] have detected the level of CD107a/b in antigen-specific CD8+ T cells during mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. However, the expression of CD107a/b of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in SARS has never been detected. Our results showed for the first time that the expression of CD107a/b in peptides stimulated lymphocytes from spleens markedly increased, suggesting the production of cytotoxic antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in vaccinated Tg mice. Meanwhile, we detected the co-expression of IFN-\u03b3 with CD107a/b, and TNF-\u03b1 with Cd107a/b respectively. Interestingly, the data demonstrated that a population of CD107a/b+CD8+ T cells that did not produce IFN-\u03b3 or TNF-\u03b1 could be observed (Fig. 6B). These data imply that measuring CD8+ T cell responses by IFN-\u03b3 production alone in previous studies may underestimate the total responses and the variety of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in vivo.",

In this study, the expression of CD45RB molecule was high on the most of IFN-\u03b3 producing CD8+ T cells. The presence of this naive phenotype on CD8+ T cells after antigen exposure has already been observed and could be explained by a re-expression after a down-regulation during the effector phase [42], [43]. CD62L, a surface protein that mediates homing to lymphoid organs, is reversible in vivo as already described [41], [42]. In fact, TCM express relatively high levels of CD62L and TEM express relatively low levels of this molecule. We observed rather 84% of a population of IFN-\u03b3+CD8+ T cells with CD62Llow and 16% of central memory IFN-\u03b3+CD8+ T cells with CD62Lhigh. These results are similar with the founding by Meraldi V who demonstrated most of multimer+ CD8+ T cells had intermediate phenotype CD44high, CD45RBhigh and CD62Llow induced by polypeptide from plasmodium berghei, which might be ready to be conscripted into the effector population during reinfection [43].",

Taken together, these data provided some novel information in cellular immune responses of SARS S antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, which were important in the development of vaccine against SARS-CoV infection. Therefore, we have a hypothesis that SARS S DNA prime and HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides boost vaccine may offer considerable potential in humans, both for preventative vaccines and for past exposure prophylaxis.",
