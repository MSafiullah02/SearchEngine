Influenza represents one of the few examples of viruses with segmented genome. This, together with the widespread infection with different subtypes in various animal species, allows robust evolution through the process of 'reassortment'. The prerequisite for reassortment is a simultaneous infection with more than one strain of viruses in a host referred to as the 'mixing vessel' that allows replication and swabbing of gene segments between different strains of viruses. Water birds are well-known mixing vessels, but the reassortants are more likely to have a tropism restricted to avian species. These new reassortants may pose problems in the land birds and poultry, and subsequently be of human concern. Swine is another well-known mixing vessel. The unique property of swine is their susceptibility to both avian and human influenza viruses. Thus, reassortants from swine are more likely to gain tropism for infection in humans. Field observations made as early as 1990s have pointed out that influenza outbreaks that began with either pigs or people were then rapidly transferred to each other. 11 Swine are likely to play the role of a mixing vessel in creating pandemic strains. Although the 1918 pandemic strain was most probably an entirely avian-like virus, 12 the 1957 and 1968 pandemic strains were reassortants of human-and avian-origin viruses. 13 While the most recent pandemic, A(H1N1)pdm09, was not as severe as those that occurred before, there is no guarantee that the next pandemic will be as 'mild'. At present, a few subtypes (H5, H7 and H9) are of particular concern. Cross-species infections, especially the recent strong wave of human A(H7N9) infection in Mainland China underscores that the next pandemic could be imminent. 14, 15 Countries should have pandemic preparedness in place, including antiviral stockpiling and pandemic vaccine preparations.

The incubation period for A(H5N1) infection ranges from 2 to 8 days but may be as long as 17 days. The clinical spectrum may range from asymptomatic infection, mild influenza-like illness to severe pneumonia, with multiorgan failure. 19 Some of the A(H5N1) human cases have been linked to consumption of dishes made of raw, contaminated poultry blood. However, slaughter, defeathering, handling carcasses of infected poultry and preparing poultry for consumption, especially in household settings, appear to be important risk factors. 19, 20 Among the fatal cases, the median duration from symptom onset to death was 9-10 days (range: 6-30 days). 20 Viral RNA was present in the blood of fatal A(H5N1) cases and this was associated with higher pharyngeal viral loads. Nasopharyngeal swab samples, bronchoalveolar lavage and cerebrospinal fluid samples were positive in the Canadian case for influenza A(H5N1) virus by various molecular testing methods, including sequencing. 18 In addition, lymphopenia and high chemokine/cytokine levels have been observed in severe A(H5N1) infection and these correlated with pharyngeal loads. 21 A new reassortant genotype of A(H5N1) containing the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes from clade 1.1.2 and the internal genes from clade 2.3.2.1 was detected in 2013 and associated with the highest number of cases (n = 26) and deaths (n = 14) in Cambodia. 22 Complete viral genome analysis of the fatal case in Canada has shown an HA gene of clade 2.3.2.1c and was a reassortant with an A(H9N2) subtype lineage polymerase basic 2 gene without mutations conferring resistance to adamantanes or NA inhibitors (NAI). 18 Human-human transmission remains rare as a meta-analysis has shown that only 1-2% of more than 12 500 study participants from 20 studies exposed to patients with A(H5N1) infection had serological evidence for prior A(H5N1) infection. 23 Delay in the delivery of appropriate treatment to patients with influenza A(H5N1) infection in Indonesia was mainly related to delay in diagnosis rather than late presentation to healthcare settings. 24 Age, country, per capita government health expenditure and delay from symptom onset to hospitalization were the risk factors for mortality related to A(H5N1) infection, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis, treatment and supportive care. 25 A systematic review has shown that females were at higher risk of death (OR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.27-2.44) following A(H5N1) infection, whereas young age in particular <5 years was protective (OR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.25-0.79). 26", "cite_spans": [{"start": 103, "end": 104, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 294, "end": 296, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 396, "end": 398, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 616, "end": 618, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 966, "end": 968, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1267, "end": 1270, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1271, "end": 1273, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1379, "end": 1381, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1707, "end": 1709, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1861, "end": 1863, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2136, "end": 2138, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2394, "end": 2396, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2631, "end": 2633, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2834, "end": 2836, "text": "24", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3084, "end": 3086, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Avian influenza viruses H5N1 viruses"}, {"text": "Human infections with a novel avian influenza A (H7N9) virus were first reported in China in March 2013 in patients hospitalized with severe pneumonia. 27 There have been five seasonal epidemics in China since the virus was first discovered in 2013. The estimated risk of death (hospitalization fatality risk, HFR) among hospitalized cases of A(H7N9) infection in the second epidemic was 48% (95% credibility interval: 42-54%), which was slightly higher than the corresponding risk of 36% in the first wave. In the second epidemic, the HFR was estimated at 36% (95% CI: 28-45%) in patients aged <60 years but at 59% (95% CI: 51-67%) among those aged \u226560 years. 28 An upsurge in human A(H7N9) infections has been observed since November 2016 in Mainland China. During this fifth epidemic wave, the number of human cases is higher than during the previous two waves during 2014-2015 and 2015-2016. The majority of recently reported human cases are associated with exposure to infected live poultry or contaminated environments, including wet markets where live poultry are sold. In addition, the human cases are more geographically widespread and cases are also reported from rural areas, unlike in previous epidemics (Fig. 2) . 29, 30 The phylogenetic analysis on HA genes of isolates collected from humans suggested that the virus is evolving and with the more recent isolates clustered to a separate branch (Supplementary Figure S1 ). 31, 32 As of 5 April 2017, 1364 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported to World Health Organization (WHO). 33 Human cases of A(H7N9) infection exported from the Mainland of China have been confirmed in Hong Kong (n = 21), Taiwan (n = 4), Macau (n = 2), Canada (n = 2) and Malaysia (n = 1) in visitors who developed illness after returning from the Mainland of China to their home cities. 29, 30, 33 The incubation period of human infection with the A(H7N9) virus ranges from 1 to 10 days, with an average of 5 days. The median time from poultry exposure to disease onset was 6 days, whereas the median time from illness onset to hospitalization, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) development, antiviral therapy and death were 4, 7, 6 and 21 days, respectively. 34 Preexisting co-morbid conditions occurred in >60% of these cases. The prominent clinical features on admission were those of a severe influenza syndrome with fever, cough, fatigue and dyspnoea, whereas the most striking laboratory findings were marked lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. Elevated cytokine levels have been observed in patients and the excessive cytokine responses may contribute to the clinical severity of A(H7N9) infection. 35, 36 Limited human to human transmission with at least two epidemiologically linked cases due to close household contact with the index patients has been reported in a number of family clusters in both A(H5N1) 20, 37, 38 and A(H7N9) infections. 34, 39, 40 Nosocomial transmission of A(H7N9) infection between two patients sharing a hospital room, 41 and co-transmission of avian influenza A(H7N9) and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses between two patients with haematological disorders sharing the same room with bed distance <1 m have been reported. 42 Comparisons of the clinical features between human cases of A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) are shown in Table 1 . 34, 43 Closure of live poultry markets (LPM) in the Mainland of China has tremendously reduced the risk of A(H7N9) infection temporarily but closure is difficult to sustain due to cultural preference for live poultry.

However, as some avian influenza A(H5N1) strains are still susceptible, 59 combination of an adamantane with an NAI may enhance antiviral activity for susceptible isolates. 60 Oseltamivir is effective in reducing mortality (OR: 0.17; P = 0.04) in influenza A(H5N1) infection when given before the onset of respiratory failure, 61 and may provide some survival benefit (49% reduction in mortality) when treatment is started within 6-8 days after symptom onset. 62 Several observational studies have shown that treatment with oseltamivir for adults hospitalized with severe influenza is associated with lower mortality and better clinical outcomes, especially when antiviral treatment has been initiated within 2 days of illness onset but even as late as 4-5 days after symptom onset. 63, 64 A systematic review has shown that in prophylactic studies, oseltamivir could reduce the proportion of symptomatic influenza whereas in treatment studies it modestly reduced the time to first alleviation of symptoms by 16.8 h, but it caused nausea, vomiting, headaches and renal/psychiatric side effects. 65 A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) has shown that oseltamivir in adults with influenza shortens time to clinical symptom alleviation by 21%, reduces risks of LRT complications and hospitalization, but increases the occurrence of nausea and vomiting. 66 Oseltamivir resistance is infrequent in A(H5N1), and <3% in circulating A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and B viruses but it is important to monitor for antiviral resistance when managing patients with severe influenza. 67 All H7N9 viruses are amantadine resistant due to the S31N substitution in the M2 ion channel protein. In patients hospitalized with severe A(H7N9) infection, reduction of viral load following oseltamivir treatment was associated with improved outcome, whereas the emergence of virus resistant to NAI harbouring an R292K mutation was associated with poor outcomes and lack of response to oseltamivir and peramivir, and reduced susceptibility to zanamivir and laninamivir (50-and 25-fold rises in inhibitory concentration by 50% (IC 50 ), respectively). Two patients with severe A(H7N9) infection and R292K mutation requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation had received systemic corticosteroid treatment which might have contributed to treatment failure and a fatal outcome. 68 The recommended treatment duration of oseltamivir is generally 5 days, but longer treatment (10 days, then guided by clinical and virological testing as recommended by the WHO) is advisable for critically ill patients with respiratory failure with persistent viral replication in the LRT. 51, 58, 69 Whether higher than standard dose of NAI would provide greater antiviral effects in such patients requires further investigation. One RCT of hospitalized patients (76% being children) revealed no clinical or virological advantages when comparing double dose of oseltamivir against standard dose. 70 No additional benefit of higher dose oseltamivir treatment was observed in adults hospitalized with influenza A, although a faster virological response was noted in influenza B. 71 However, an RCT of 18 critically ill patients with A(H1N1)pdm09 in Canada found that therapy with a triple dose of oseltamivir was associated with higher proportions of viral clearance at 5 days than standard therapy (78% vs 11%; P = 0.015). 72 Intravenous (i.v.) peramivir treatment was associated with viral RNA decline as well as culture and RNA negativity, which occurred at similar rates to those on oral oseltamivir by Day 5 among adult patients hospitalized for influenza-associated LRT complications. 73 The various NAI dosages for adults with adjustment for renal failure are shown in Table 3 . 58 Zanamivir and laninamivir have quite similar profiles of drug susceptibility. One example is that H275Y mutation, which confers high level resistance to oseltamivir carboxylate and reduced susceptibility to peramivir in N1-containing viruses, does not reduce susceptibility to zanamivir and laninamivir Most RIDT are chromatographic immunoassays (some are fluorescence-based immunoassays); applicable to NP swabs, nasal and/or throat swabs and NP aspirates/washes (training and protection equipment are required). Performance is best if applied within 48-72 h from onset before a significant drop in viral load (up to 4-5 days in selected populations). Lower sensitivity for A(H1N1) pdm09 virus has been reported. Viral cell culture detects viable viruses, including those contained in the live-attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV). Isolates can be subjected to phenotypic resistance assays (e.g. neuraminidase enzyme inhibition assay).

However, a meta-analysis of data predominantly related to treatment of severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 has shown that systemic corticosteroid was associated with an increase in mortality (OR: 3.06, 95% CI: 1.58-5.92).
