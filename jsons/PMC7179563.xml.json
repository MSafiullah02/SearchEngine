            "text": "Coronavirus consists of a group of viruses infecting both humans and animals and causing mostly respiratory disease [1]. The family Coronaviridae contains more than 10 coronaviruses which are classified into three groups based on their antigenic and phylogenetic relationships. Together with the families Arteriviridae and Roniviridae, Coronaviridae is classified as a member in the order Nidovirales [2]. The coronavirus is enveloped and corona-like spikes or peplomers can be seen around the envelope when viewed under electron microscopy. The core inside the envelope contains a single-stranded (ss), positive-sense genome RNA of 27\u201333 kb wrapped by nucleocapsid protein. The coronavirus RNA genome is the largest RNA genome among all known non-segmented RNA viruses and encodes more than 10 AUG-containing open reading frames (ORF), each of which is expressed as an independent protein [3]. About two thirds of the genome at the 5\u2032 end encodes two ORFs, 1a and 1b, which are translated to produce polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, the latter being produced through a \u22121 frameshift translational mechanism [3, 4, 5]. Structural genes are located at the 3\u2032 end of the genome. One unique feature of coronaviruses is that they produce a set of 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 co-terminal subgenomic mRNAs (sgRNA) for structure and accessory gene production. The mechanism for sgRNA production is currently under debate [6, 7].",

            "text": "Coronavirus polyprotein pp1ab is a large polypeptide. The C-terminal part of the pp1ab shares relatively high conservation among coronaviruses. Polyprotein pp1ab is processed into more than 15\u201316 non-structural proteins (nsps) by polyprotein-encoded 3-cystine-like proteinase (3CLpro) and papain-like proteinase (PLP). These nsps form replication complexes where coronavirus genome replication and transcription take place. Bioinformatics analysis predicted the existence of another six enzymes, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), NTPase/helicase, exoribonuclease (ExoN), endoribonuclease (endoRNAse), 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase (2\u2032-O-MT) and ADP-ribose-1\u2032-phosphatase diesterase [8]. Among these enzymes, endoribonuclease has gained much attention since the discovery that the endoribonuclease activity of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) nsp15 is similar to that of Xenopus XendoU [9], which requires manganese as a cofactor to cleave uridylate-containing ssRNA [10, 11]. Due to the sequence conservation of SARS nsp15 within the order Nidovirales, U-specific Nidovirales endoribonuclease (NendoU) was engineered to refer to Nidovirales endoU to indicate its relation with XendoU [11]. The activity of recombinant NendoU has been identified for human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) nsp15 [11], mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) A59 nsp15 [12], and equine arteritis virus (EAV) nsp11 [13]. Unlike XendoU, which is a monomer that cleaves ssRNA, NendoU functions as a hexamer that cleaves both ss- and double-stranded (ds)-RNA [12, 14, 15, 16]. Reverse genetics with point mutation revealed that NendoU might be involved in genome replication and sgRNA transcription, but its exact role requires further investigation [11, 13].",

The ligation reaction was carried out at 16\u00b0 overnight, and 2 \u03bcl of the reaction was transformed into TOP10 chemically competent cells according to the vendor's procedure (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., USA). Positive colonies were screened by PCR and enzyme digestion. Plasmid pTrinsp15 was isolated with QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif., USA) and submitted for DNA sequencing at the Genomic Core Facility, Purdue University.

To express the recombinant TCoV nsp15, plasmid pTrinsp15 was transformed into BL21 (DE3) cells. A typical expression pattern of TCoV nsp15 in BL21 (DE3) is shown in figure 1b. After 3 h of induction with IPTG, there was no obvious nsp15 expression (fig. 1b). After purification through Ni-NTA resin, a single band around 43 kDa was seen on SDS-PAGE.

This observation was in contrast to NendoU of SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E, MHV, and EAV [10, 13, 25]. Whether this difference is rudimental or has biological relevance is not yet clear. Because TCoV is a group 3 coronavirus, and nsp15 of TCoV and IBV share over 90% sequence similarity, it is worth determining whether or not IBV nsp15 requires Mn2+ as a cofactor. Recent studies on the crystal structures of NendoU of SARS-CoV and MHV failed to demonstrate coordinating package of Mn2+ within the crystal [12]. One possibility is that Mn2+ enhances affinity between nsp15 and the RNA molecule. Recent data from SARS-CoV showing that Mn2+ increased interaction between a SARS nsp15 mutant protein, H234A, and a synthetic RNA, rU16 [24], are consistent with our hypothesis.",

Our data also revealed for the first time that disulfide bonds are involved in the formation of a trimer or hexamer and are essential for the enzymatic activity of the TCoV nsp15 (fig. 6). The monomer or trimer showed no RNase activity. Intramolecular disulfide bonds within the TCoV nsp15 were observed. The hexamer form of NendoU was demonstrated in SARS and MHV NendoU [12, 14]. Recent crystal structure analysis revealed that the hexamer of NendoU of SARS-CoV and MHV was formed by two trimers through back-to-back interactions [12, 16]. Our zymography results about the TCoV nsp15 as well as data from other NendoU indicate the in vitro active form of the NendoU is a homohexamer; whether this is the case in vivo requires further investigation.",

Using reverse genetics, a point mutation in HCoV-229E NendoU resulted in a lack of viral genome replication and transcription [11]. However, no rescue experiment was performed to demonstrate that it was the RNase activity of the enzyme which caused the failure in genome replication and transcription. In EAV, extensive site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed that the loss of the whole NendoU was lethal for the virus, while point mutations of the enzyme mostly affected the production of sgRNA [13]. Considering that the coronavirus genome is ssRNA, having two RNases (nsp14 and nsp15) in the genome seems peculiar for the virus. For the RNases to exert their functions but not degrade viral genomic RNA and sgRNA, the activity and specificity of the RNases must be under tight control. Therefore, it is expected that viral or cellular proteins play roles in regulating NendoU activity and specificity.",
