With respect to murine viruses, a summary of data from the past decade shows that the most prevalent in the United States (Carty 2008; Livingston and Riley 2003) and Europe (Schoondermark-van de Ven et al. 2006) are mouse hepatitis virus (MHV1), parvoviruses, mouse rotavirus, Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV1), reovirus type 3 (reo 3), Sendai virus, and mouse adenovirus (MAdV) (FL + K87). The report on European prevalence (Schoondermark-van de Ven et al. 2006) showed that the main viruses of concern there are MHV (12%), parvoviruses (8.8%), mouse rotavirus (3.7%), TMEV (2.2%), reo 3 (0.6%), pneumonia virus of mice (PVM, 0.2%), Sendai virus (0.2%), and polyoma (0.1%). The same report noted that viruses such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), mouse K virus, ectromelia virus, MAdV, and mouse thymic virus (MTV) have not been detected in Europe in the last decade. These data are based on serological analysis of 80% of samples obtained between 2000 and 2003 from more than 100 different institutions including universities, research centers, breeding companies, and industry in the Netherlands (45%), France (35%), Belgium (7%), and other European countries (13%, mainly Germany and Switzerland).",

Tebourbi and colleagues (2002) examined whether MCMV microinjected directly into zygote-stage embryos (simulating ICSI conditions) would result in infected live pups; they were able to infect the embryos, and the virus was present up until the blastocyst stage but disappeared in fetuses and pups. Retroviruses have been demonstrated to replicate in epididymal sperm epithelium and associate with spermatozoa as they move through the epididymis, suggesting that venereal transmission is possible (Kiessling et al. 1989).",

In these two studies, spermatozoa collected from males with testes that tested positive for either H. typhlonius or MHV failed to produce positive live pups after IVF and embryo transfer (ET1). Peters and colleagues (2006) demonstrated that standard washing procedures in the IVF and embryo culture system are sufficient to eliminate MHV transmission when spermatozoa and oocytes are incubated with high levels of virus. MPV was recently found in spermatozoal samples (Agca et al. 2007), but it remains to be determined if embryos generated using MPV-contaminated sperm result in infected offspring. In a recent study (Mahabir et al. 2007a) we demonstrated that MVM-exposed in vivo\u2013derived embryos washed ten times are still capable of transmitting the virus to recipient female mice. However, we also demonstrated that the IVF-ET procedure with MVM-contaminated spermatozoa resulted in the production of virus-free seronegative pups (Mahabir et al. 2008).",

Ovarian tissue transplantation carries an increased risk compared to gametes and embryos because it is a complex organ with multiple cell types, and tissue from viremic donors is likely to transfer infectious organisms. Retroviral contamination of donor tissue by a recipient female has occurred with transmission to recovered offspring (Lock et al. 1988), demonstrating that genetic alteration via retroviruses can occur in offspring as a consequence of either the donor or recipient female. Ovarian tissue from mice naturally infected with MHV has been shown to transmit MHV to the recipient females and offspring (Scavizzi and Raspa 2004). In contrast, H. typhlonius\u2013infected ovarian tissue transplantation did not result in infection of the recipient female or offspring (Scavizzi and Raspa 2006).

Care should be taken to ensure that collection and/or processing of cells and tissues of the germplasm are performed under sterile conditions. To determine microbiological status\u2014for example, if investigators suspect the presence of a particular agent or wish to screen for a limited number of agents\u2014it may be useful to test aliquots of biological materials, collection media, or washing drops by molecular biological analysis. Well-established sensitive PCR techniques are available for determining the microbiological status of murine biological materials in-house or by commercial laboratories. In addition, the mouse antibody production (MAP) test (Bauer et al. 2004; Blank et al. 2004; Bootz et al. 2003; Livingston et al. 2004; Mahabir et al. 2004) is also performed as antibodies to several viruses are detectable by standard serological analyses. For such tests, mice should be free of all FELASA-listed microorganisms (as well as MNV) and held under conditions that prevent dissemination of infectious agents.",
