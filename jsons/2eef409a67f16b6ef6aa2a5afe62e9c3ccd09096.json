Ligation of EMR2 boosts the activation and recruitment of neutrophils, increases neutrophil adhesion may sense renal insults, possibly by primary cilium-mediated mechanotransduction, and trigger a TOR-initiated repair program. 7 Proteins TRPP1 and TRPP2 represent an adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor and a mechanosensitive, calcium-permeable, non-selective cation channel of the TRP channel family located at the primary cilium that causes calcium transients at the cilium, respectively. Protein TRPP1 can interact with the C-terminus of TRPP2, thereby regulating the TRPP2 activity. 8 Protein TRPP1 is a multidomain glycoprotein of 4,303 amino acids. It is made of a large extracellular N-terminal region, a membrane-spanning domain with 11 transmembrane segments, and a cytosolic C-terminal segment (Table 7 .12). The last 7. The primary cilium of renal epithelial cells is a non-motile, mechanosensory extensions of the apical (luminal) plasma membrane that bends in response to urine flow and provokes a transient rise in the intracellular calcium concentration. Polycystin-1 links ciliary mechanosensation to changes in gene transcription via flow-regulated proteolytic cleavage of the TRPP1 cytoplasmic tail, its nuclear translocation, and stimulation of STAT6 transcriptional activity [778] .",

Additional activation of Gi by \u03b22-adrenergic receptors explains the difference in signaling by \u03b21-(the predominant subtype in cardiomyocytes) and \u03b22adrenergic receptors. Subunit Gi slows down the heart rate and atrioventricular conductance. Isoform Gi2, the major Gi subunit in cardiomyocytes, represses the activity of Ca V 1 channels. Table 7 .17.

G\u03b1 subunits define the basic properties of a heterotrimeric G protein. They can be classified into 4 families, G\u03b1 s , G\u03b1 i/o , G\u03b1 q/11 , and G\u03b1 12/13 . In addition to Gs, 2 transcripts that encode XL \u03b1s and neuroendocrine secretory protein NESP55 are generated by promoters upstream of the GNAS (Gs-encoding) promoter of the GNAS complex locus. Extra-large protein Gs XL that has a limited expression pattern (adrenal gland, heart, pancreas, brain, and pituitary pars intermedia) is able to bind to G\u03b2\u03b3 dimer and provoke cAMP synthesis. The GNASXL gene also produce ALEX that inhibits Gs XL . In addition, exon 3 of the GNAS gene is alternatively spliced to give rise to long (Gs L ) and short (Gs S ) Gs isoforms. Subsequently, these effectors activate or inhibit the production of second messengers (cAMP, cGMP, diacylglycerol, inositol trisphosphate, phosphatidylinositol Go-Coupled muscarinic channels M 2 also inhibit Ca V 1 channels. In enteroendocrine cells, bitter taste receptors (T 2 R) and G\u03b1 gust of the Gi/o group increase Ca ++ influx via activated Ca V 1 channels [794] . In the hippocampus, activated Gi/o-coupled adenosine receptor A 1 suppresses serotonin release, as it inhibits Ca V 2.2 and Ca V 2.1 channels (more precisely Ca V 2.2-PKC-syntaxin and Ca V 2.1-PKA-synaptobrevin axes) [795] . On the other hand, activated Gscoupled A 2 stimulates serotonin release, as it stimulates Ca V 2.1 channels (Ca V 2.1-PKAsynaptobrevin axis). The 3 Gi subtypes (Gi1-Gi3) activate K + channels K IR 3 (K ACh current) of atriomyocytes (G\u03b2\u03b3 dimer is inactive) [796] . Gi/o-Coupled glutamate receptor mGluR7 is able to inhibit Ca V 2.1 channels via G\u03b2\u03b3 dimer. Upon Ca ++ influx, Ca ++ -calmodulin binds to macrophage myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (macMARCKS) that is tethered to mGluR7 [797] . It then displaces macMARCKS and G\u03b2\u03b3 from mGluR7 receptor. G\u03b2\u03b3 Dimer can then inhibit Ca V 2.1 channel. In sympathetic neurons, G\u03b2\u03b3 inhibits Ca V 2.2 channels upon stimulation by noradrenaline and somatostatin [798]. ). Subunits G15 and G16 are the murine and human ortholog, respectively. Enzymes PLC\u03b21, -3, and -4 are the major effectors of Gq/11 and PLC\u03b22 is a minor effector. Subunits G12 and G13 are often activated by Gq/G11-coupled receptors (crosstalk). Cadherins (a portmanteau word for calcium-dependent adhesion) are type-1 transmembrane proteins and constituents of adherens junction. They are connected to nearby actin filaments via \u03b1-actinin and cortical actin via catenin and vinculin. Radixin is a cytoskeletal linker of actin to the plasma membrane. Members of the G\u03b1 i , G\u03b1 q , and G\u03b1 12/13 families cooperate to regulate Ca ++ signal and nitric oxide (NO). Subunit G\u03b1 q targets phospholipase-C and causes Ca ++ influx without the assistance of NO. Subunit G\u03b1 13 supports Ca ++ influx by a mechanism dependent on NO, guanylate cyclase, and cGMP (a process blocked by activated adenylate cyclase, the cAMP-PKA axis preventing Ca ++ influx and NO production). NO may relieve inhibition of adenylate cyclase caused by Gi subunit via adpribosylation of Gi subunit.",

A relatively small number of G proteins transduce signals from a large number of GPCRs. Each member of the G-protein family is thus able to interact with many different GPCRs. In addition, many GPCRs can activate multiple G proteins. Suitable signal transduction relies on specific interactions. Each contact site of G\u03b1 subunits, as well as other molecular regions, contribute to coupling specificity [792] . In addition, specific isoforms of G\u03b2 interact preferentially with specific GPCRs. 19 The 19. Subunits G\u03b24 and G\u03b25 have the strongest and the poorest coupling ability with \u03b21adrenergic and A 2A adenosine receptors. Subunits G\u03b21 and G\u03b24 have a similar coupling capacity with \u03b21-adrenergic receptor, but G\u03b21 has 20-fold lower coupling capacity than G\u03b24 for adenosine receptor. [767] ). In the absence of signaling, G\u03b1 subunit is tethered to its associated G\u03b2\u03b3 dimer.

Subunit G\u03b25 only binds weakly to G\u03b3 and links to regulators of G-protein signaling. It resides mainly in the brain. Subunits G\u03b21 to G\u03b24 as well as G\u03b32, G\u03b34 to G\u03b36, and G\u03b310 to G\u03b312 are widely distributed.

The subcutaneous connective tissue is composed of cells embedded in the extracellular matrix mainly constituted by collagen and elastic fibers in a gel of glycoproteins and proteoglycans.

The same acupoints can also be stimulated by other methods, such as moxibuxion, acupressure, and electroacupuncture. Moxibustion relies on heating acupoints by burning a moxa stick made of Artemisia vulgaris (common mugwort) to stimulate the blood circulation and produce a smoother flow of Qi [807] . Acupressure can be referred as needleless acupuncture by applying finger pressure. Electroacupuncture relies on the electrical stimulation of acupoints [808]. Table 7 .22. Released molecules by the mastocyte and their effects. Acupuncture can be modeled by an immediate and a late response. Nerves and mastocytes exchange chemical messengers such as substance-P. The latter stimulates histamine and nitric oxide (NO) release. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) causes a vasodilation; nitric oxide cooperates with CGRP to increase its positive inotropic effect that raises the local blood flow in dilated vessels. Histamine is quickly catabolized, thereby acting near the site of release. Resulting vasodilation and increased vessel wall permeability support the transfer of chemical mediators into the blood circulation. The NO concentration rises and enhances the vasodilation. Serotonin has a biphasic effect, as it triggers a vasoconstriction and promotes NO release, hence a subsequent vasodilation. Nerve growth factor (NGF), tumor-necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukins (IL) are potent mastocyte chemoattractants. Mastocyte chemotaxis is supported by matrix degradation by secreted peptidases. Vasoconstriction followed by NO-mediated vasodilation Thromboxane-A2 Vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation Tryptase, chymase Matrix degradation for enhanced cell migration tidases (e.g., tryptase), growth factors (e.g., FGF, gmCSF, and NGF), and cytokines (e.g., interleukins and tumor-necrosis factor). Nerve endings are stimulated and release substance-P that further activates mastocytes and triggers the production of nitric oxide.",

Whereas each DNA strand is composed of 4 bases -adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine -, single-stranded RNA contains adenine, cytosine, guanine, and uracil. 50. Purines are components of numerous molecules, such as: (1) purine nucleosides adenosine and guanosine; (2) adenylate (ATP, ADP, AMP, and cAMP) and guanylate (GTP, GDP, GMP, and cGMP) nucleotides; and (3) nucleotides constituents of enzymatic cofactors (coenzyme-A, flavin adenine dinucleotide [FAD], flavin mononucleotide [FMN] , and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate [NADH] ).

Pyrimidine nucleotides encompass uridine mono-(or 5 -uridylic acid [UMP]), di-(UDP), and triphosphate (UTP). 51. Nucleotide receptors P2X are fast-acting, ligand-gated channels that are selective for calcium. When ATP binds to plasmalemmal P2X receptors, extracellular Ca ++ enters and activates signal transduction pathways. These homo-and hetero-oligomeric channels contain 2 transmembrane domains. Nucleotides can be stored and secreted upon adequate cell excitation to serve as messengers that bind to P2Y receptors. In the chromaffin granules of the adrenal medulla, ATP concentration reaches 100 mmol (cytoplasmic concentration 3-5 mmol) [874] . Dense granules of platelets contain about 500 mmol of ADP and ATP, as well as lower amounts of other nucleotides (adenine dinucleotides, GTP, and UTP). Following secretion and/or degranulation upon appropriate stimulation, 52 concentration of released nucleotides transiently reaches high levels. Nucleotide concentration is much higher near producing cell surface than in bulk extracellular fluid. 52. Change in blood flow pattern induces ATP release from endothelial cells. Release of ATP from human nasal epithelial cells increases upon mechanical stimulation or rising intracellular concentration of calcium ions.

Some P2Y receptors couple exclusively to a single G\u03b1-protein subunit, whereas others are dually coupled to different G\u03b1-protein subunits (e.g., Gq/11 and Gi). Four subtypes of P1 receptors (A 1 , A 2A , A 2B , and A 3 ) exist. The P1/A 2 receptors are coupled to Gs subunit and stimulates adenylate cyclase, whereas P1/A 1 and P1/A 3 receptors couple to subunits of the Gi/o family and inhibit adenylate cyclase. The P2Y 5 receptor corresponds to LPA 6 receptor that primes the G13-Rho pathway. The P2Y 9 receptor (or LPA 4 ) is most closely related to P2Y 5 (both act as lipid and nucleotide receptors).",

Afterward, extracellular nucleotides are rapidly degraded by ubiquitous ectonucleotidases on the cell surface. 53 53. Two families of integral membrane ectonucleotidases exist: ectonucleotide diphosphohydrolases (ENPDH or CD39) and ecto-phosphodiesterase-nucleotide pyrophosphatase Inhibition of platelet aggregation Nucleotides exert their effects mainly via binding P2 receptors, although phosphorylation of plasmalemmal proteins by ectoprotein kinases constitutes an additional mechanism by which ATP can modulate cell function. 54 Nucleotide P2Y receptors can be partly characterized by order of potency of ligand binding. These receptors are activated by a set of nucleotides: adenosine diphosphate (ADP), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), uridine triphosphate (UTP), and uridine diphosphate-glucose ( UDP glucose; Table 7 .34). 55 The P2Y receptors can possess a main ligand, whereas other nucleotides behave as partial agonists. Nonetheless, (EPDNP) . The latter catalyze the cleavage of ATP into AMP and pyrophosphate, the conversion of cAMP into AMP, as well as several ATP-ADP, ADP-AMP, and AMP-adenosine reactions. Agent CD39 expressed by vascular endothelial cells hydrolyzes both ATP and ADP released from platelets. 54. Various plasmalemmal proteins are phosphorylated in their ectodomains by cell-surface protein kinase, the ectoprotein kinase. Protein CD36 (a.k.a. glycoprotein-3b and -4) is a class-B scavenger receptor that binds many ligands, such as collagen, thrombospondin, lipoproteins, oxidized low-density lipoproteins and phospholipids, as well as long-chain fatty acids. In platelets, cAMP-dependent ectoprotein kinase phosphorylates CD36 and causes platelet reactivity and adhesion to collagen, but reduces thrombospondin binding. Conversely, CD36 dephosphorylation transforms CD36 into a thrombospondin receptor [874] .",

A first striatonigral population projects to the entopeduncular nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata and synthesizes substance-P and dynorphin, an opioid peptide stored in large (size 80-120 nm), dense-core vesicles. Striatonigral gabaergic neurons preferentially express D 1 receptor that fosters the production of substance-P and dynorphin. The second striatopallidal pool projects to the external segment of the globus pallidus and contains enkephalin. Striatopallidal gabaergic neurons prominently synthesize D 2 receptor that prevents the production of preproenkephalin. A similar organization of dopamine receptors is observed in the nucleus accumbens: D 1 receptor is mostly expressed in substance-P+ neurons, D 2 receptor in enkephalin+, neurotensin+ neurons, and D 3 receptor in substance-P+, neurotensin+ neurons [995] . However, in most of the neuronal populations, D 1 and D 2 are coexpressed rather than segregated.",

Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HBEGF) of the EGF family is synthesized as a type-1 transmembrane precursor (proHBEGF). At the cell surface, pro-HBEGF is a juxtacrine growth factor that signals to neighboring cells via an intercellular contact. The ectodomain of proHBEGF is shed and can serve as an N-terminal soluble ligand of EGFR ( N HBEGF or simply HBEGF) that can indirectly transactivate HER2, HER3, and HER4 heterodimerized with EGFR (HER1). 131. Plasmalemmal estrogen receptor-\u03b1 is a palmitoylated protein. 17\u03b2-Estradiol reduces ER\u03b1 palmitoylation and its interaction with caveolin-1 in a time-and dose-dependent manner [1014] . Palmitoylation of ER\u03b1 enables rapid E 2 signaling via the ERK and PI3K-PKB pathways. Upon 17\u03b2-estradiol binding, ER\u03b1 undergoes depalmitoylation and dissociates from caveolin-1 (inactivation-activation cycle). 132. Commensal bacterial communities are closely associated with the human skin, oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and the female genital tract. Gut flora consists of microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, and protozoa). Most bacteria belong to the species Bacteroides, Clostridium, Fusobacterium, Eubacterium, Ruminococcus, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, and Bifidobacterium, as well as, but to a lesser extent, Escherichia and Lactobacillus. The major species are Bacteroides fragilis, Bifidobacterium adoloscentis, and Eubacterium areofaciens [1017] . The remainder is mainly Escherichia coli, Streptococcus viridans, Streptococcus salivaris, and lactobacilli. Anaerobic species outnumber aerobes (at least 10-fold). The Bacteroides-Prevotella group (Gram\u2212 anaerobes) and Clostridium species (Gram+ anaerobes) predominate [1018] .

Galanin mainly inhibits both the noradrenergic and serotonergic networks via Gal 1 and Gal 3 receptors. It also impedes neurotransmission via Gal 2 and Gi/o subunits, but can stimulate neurotransmitter release via Gal 2 and Gq/11 subunits. Galanin hampers neurotransmission in memory acquisition, modulates food intake and sexual behavior, and participates in the control of pain.

I.e., amine in biological tissues. This organic nitrogen compound s also called imidazolethylamine or imidazolethanamine. Histamine is synthesized from histidine taken up into the cerebrospinal fluid and neurons by amino acid transporter via oxidative decarboxylation by histidine decarboxylase. It is stored and transported into a vesicle using the vesicular monoamine transporter VMAT2, and, upon appropriate cues, released and methylated (inactivated) by neuronal histamine N methyltransferase using S adenosyl methionine. The latter enzyme also resides in blood vessel walls and processes circulating and mastocyte-released histamine. The main histamine-degrading enzyme in peripheral organs is diamine oxidase that converts histamine into imidazoleacetic acid [1025] . 143. In the mammalian brain, histaminergic neurons localize exclusively in the tuberomamillary nucleus of the posterior hypothalamus and send their axons to the entire central nervous system, like other amine networks [1025] . All amine networks rely on autoreceptors that yield a negative feedback on excitability and amine neurotransmitter release and synthesis. Histaminergic neurons are active only during waking; they maintain wakefulness and attention. Mutual interactions with other transmitter networks are involved in higher brain functions (sleep-wake regulation, circadian and feeding rhythms, immunity, learning, and memory. Although histamine is the main neurotransmitter in the tuberomamillary nucleus, cotransmitters include GABA, galanin, enkephalins, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, and substance-P [1025]. Glutamatergic fibers from the cortex and hypothalamus secrete glutamate that excites neurons of the tuberomamillary nucleus. On the other hand, glycine inhibits a subpopulation of histaminergic neurons. In addition, gabaergic cues from mostly hypothalamic origin suppress the firing of histaminergic neurons. Aminergic (noradrenergic via gabaregic and serotoninregic) and cholinergic neurons also send projections to histaminergic neurons. Nucleotides excite histaminergic neurons using ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. 144. In neuroepithelial and hematopoietic cells, histamine participates in contraction of airway and intestinal smooth muscles, but vasodilation, as well as gastric acid secretion, mastocyte-based innate and acquired immunity, allergy, and inflammation, T-cell-associated immunity modulation, and control of epi-and endothelial barriers [1025]. likely the satiety center of the ventromedial hypothalamus. Histamine effects on food intake are associated with other facors, such as neuropeptide-Y, peptide-YY, and bombesin. In addition, orexigenic action of orexins and anorexigenic effects of leptin and glucagon-like peptide-1, which depend on corticotropin-releasing hormone released by neurons of the paraventricular nucleus rely on H 1 receptor [1025] . The brain histamine network controls thermogenesis, mostly via feeding and motor activity [1025] . The body's autonomic response that regulates heat conservation and production relies on the paraventricular nucleus and dorsomedial hypothalamus, and the nucleus raphe pallidus, respectively. Most of the structures implicated in thermoregulation are targets of histaminergic innervation.",

Lysophosphatidic acid is composed of a single fatty acyl chain, a glycerol backbone, and a phosphate group. In fact, many LPA species exist. These LPA species possess an alkyl or alkenyl ether-linked fatty acyl chain of various lengths and unsaturation degrees. A saturated or unsaturated fatty acid chain is esterified either at the sn1 (1-acylLPA; e.g., 1-palmitoylLPA) or sn2 (2-acylLPA; e.g., 2-arachidonoylLPA) position (sn: stereospecific nomenclature) of the glycerol backbone of LPA phospholipid. Ether-linked LPAs carry an alkyl-(alkylLPA; e.g., hexadecylLPA) or an alkenyl-linkage (alkenylLPA) at the sn1 position [1036] . Activity of LPA depends on: (1) the length and the unsaturation level of the carbon chain attached to the glycerol backbone and (2) the type of linkage and its position. Lysophosphatidic acid is indeed synthesized via numerous routes. In particular, autotaxin, a lysophospholipase-D, removes the choline group from lysophosphatidylcholine. 152. Lysophosphatidylcholine abounds in biological fluids linked to albumin or lipoproteins. It is synthesized from phosphatidylcholine by PLA2 or lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). 153. Autotaxin (Atx; a.k.a. lysophospholipase-D and type-2 ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase) is a transmembrane ecto-enzyme. It is upregulated by certain peptide growth factors. Soluble autotaxin derives from a membrane-bound form by proteolytic cleavage. 154. In 1960, Vogt observed that LPA causes the contraction of isolated rabbit duodenum. Afterward, the contraction of smooth muscle cells generated by several LPA species was demonstrated on vascular cell types. G-protein subunit transducers, and ligands (Sources: [5, 1036] ; EDG: endothelial differentiation gene product). Lysophosphatidic acid also binds PPAR\u03b3 receptors. In addition to the 3 G-protein-coupled receptors of the endothelial differentiation gene (EDG) family (LPA 1 -LPA 3 ), lysophosphatidic acid operates via 3 other homologous receptors (LPA 4 -LPA 6 ) that are structurally distinct from the EDG family LPA receptors. The latter are involved, in particular, in angiogenesis and platelet activation. The LPA receptors of the EDG family that preferntially link to acylLPA than alkylLPA provoke intracellular Ca ++ influx, inositol phosphate production, adenylate cyclase inhibition, and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Receptors LPA 6 , or P2Y 5 , and LPA 8 , or P2Y 10 its carrier albumin. In addition to albumin, other proteins, such as fatty acid-binding proteins and gelsolin, link to LPA. Almost all cells, except in the liver, coexpress several types of LPA receptors (LPA 1 -LPA 6 ; Table 7 .75). Receptors LPA 4 and LPA 6 correspond to P2Y 9 and P2Y 5 , respectively [1037, 1038] . The P2Y 9 receptor is most closely related to P2Y 5 that is coupled to the G13-Rho pathway. It is relatively close to nucleotide receptors P2Y 1 , P2Y 4 , and P2Y 6 as well as lipid receptors of the group of proton-sensing GPCRs 155 and other lipid receptors, such as platelet-activating factor 156 receptor and leukotriene receptors CysLT 1 and CysLT 2 .",

In mammals, the respiratory rhythm is generated by the pre-B\u00f6tzinger complex (PBC), a cluster of interneurons in the ventrolateral medulla of the brainstem. Many neurons of the pre-B\u00f6tzinger complex produce adenosine (A 1 and A 2A ), GABA, glutamate, neurokinin-1 (NK 1 ), and serotonin receptors, such as 5HT 1A , 5HT 2A , 5HT 2B , 5HT 4 , and 5HT 7 . Serotonin receptors colocalize with opioid Op 3 receptor in respiratory neurons of the pre-B\u00f6tzinger complex to promote activity of neurotrophins. Gq-Coupled 5HT 2A and 5HT 2B receptor isoforms are coexpressed in these neurons. They does not excite breathing. Only 5HT 1A and 5HT 4 isotypes are able to counteract opioid-induced respiratory depression [1081]. 194. A.k.a. PSD95. 195 .

Among the 7 categories of 5HT receptors (5HT 1 -5HT 7 ), 1 ionotropic serotonin receptor (5HT 3 transmitter-gated Na + -K + ion channel), and 15 different metabotropic isoforms have been identified. In the central nervous system, Gi-coupled 5HT 1A is predominantly expressed in the hippocampus, lateral septum, and brain cortex, as well as in brainstem regions, such as nuclei raph\u00e9 and hypoglossal nuclei. On presynaptic terminals, it precludes presynaptic transmitter release. At postsynaptic membranes, it activates via G\u03b2\u03b3 subunit inwardly rectifying K + channels and inhibits Ca ++ channels. In the central respiratory network, serotonin lowers excitability of respiratory neurons [1081] .

Urotensin-2 causes vasoconstriction in human arteries (e.g., coronary, mammary, and radial arteries) and veins (e.g., 213 . Tryptamine serves as a backbone for members of the tryptamine group. Tryptamine derivatives comprise neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and sleep-wake cycle regulator neurohormone melatonin ( N acetyl 5-methoxytryptamine). Serotonin is synthesized from tryptophan (\u03b1-carboxyltryptamine) successively by tryptophan hydroxylase and amino acid decarboxylase. Serotonin, in turn, can be converted to melatonin by N acetyltransferase and 5-hydroxyindole O methyltransferase. 214. Tyramine is hydroxylized to octopamine by dopamine \u03b2-hydroxylase to be subsequently packaged in synaptic vesicles with noradrenaline. In mammals, octopamine may release lipids from adipocytes.

Vasopressin and its carrier neurophysin-2 also derives from the same precursor. 221 Regulation of water transport across the epithelium of the collecting duct of the nephron enables a precise control of renal water excretion, thereby regulating the osmolality of body fluids. Water transport control is mainly achieved by vasopressin that binds to V 2 receptor in the basolateral plasma membrane of principal cells of collecting duct to cause an increase in intracellular cAMP and Ca ++ concentrations. Vasopressin, indeed, favors via V 2 the transfer of aquaporin-2 to the apical plasma membrane, as it triggers phosphorylation by myosin light-chain kinase of the myosin regulatory light chain, as well as aquaporin-2 phosphorylation (Ser256, and Ser264, and S269) and dephosphorylation (Ser261) [1101] . Vasopressin primes activation of several kinases of the AGC family, such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase-A and calmodulin-dependent kinase-2 (via autophosphorylation at Thr286), but lowers phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinases and members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, such as JNK1 and JNK2 (Thr183 and Tyr185) and ERK1 and ERK2 (Thr183 and Tyr185; Thr203 and Tyr205). In normal circumstances, vasopressin attenuates activities of ERK1 and -2 and JNK1 and -2, but not P38MAPK. Aquaporin-2 is strongly phosphorylated (Ser261) by JNK, P38MAPK, and CDK5 and -9, as well as weakly by ERK kinases. It is phosphorylated (Ser256) by protein kinase-A. 218 . In rats, vasopressin signals in the olfactory system for proper social recognition [1102] . A population of vasopressin neurons resides in the olfactory bulb. In humans, oxytocin participates in the processing of social stimuli [1100] . Oxytocin reduces activation in lateral and dorsal regions of the anterior amygdala in the presence of negative social stimuli, but enhances activity for positive social stimuli. Furthermore, oxytocin increases activity in the posterior amygdala and promotes the coupling of this subregion to the superior colliculi [1100] . Oxytocin also operates in behavioral and endocrine stress responses. It contributes to increase trust and reduce betrayal aversion. 219. The pituitary gland consists of adeno-(anterior pituitary) and neurohypophysis (posterior pituitary). The pituitary secretes hormones that regulate water homeostasis, blood pressure, development, and reproduction. 220. Neurophysin-1 and oxytocin result from the cleavage of a common precursor: preprooxyphysin, or preprooxytocin-neurophysin-1. 221. Neurophysins also act as neurohypophysial hormone. Neurophysin-2 stimulates prolactin secretion. It is generated from the same precursor as vasopressin: pre-proArg vasopressin-neurophysin-2.
