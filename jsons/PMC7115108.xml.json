            "text": "SPR-based Biacore technology was originally used to investigate antibody-antigen binding (Fagerstam et al. 1990; Karlsson et al. 1991). Since then, dozens of other applications combining antibodies and Biacore systems have been generated (for an overview, see Rich and Myszka 2008). One approach is to determine the antibody concentration in sera as shown by Pol et al. (2007) or the antibody isotyping as described (Swanson et al. 2004). Recently, these instruments have also been used to screen for high-affinity antibodies from crude cell lysates (Canziani et al. 2004; Steukers et al. 2006). Here, the authors used either covalently coupled anti-human-Fc IgG antibodies or immobilized protein A to capture antibodies from various hybridoma supernatants and subsequently determined the Fab concentration from extracts. With this strategy, Canziani and coworkers, using Biacore 2000 or 3000 instruments, were able to test three antibodies from three supernatants. In a similar study, it was demonstrated that Biacore A100 and Flexchip units (array format) were suitable for increased to high throughput applications (Safsten et al. 2006; Wassaf et al. 2006).",

Interaction of the analyte with the immobilized ligand causes a change in the refractive index close to the sensor chip surface which, in turn, is detected as a change in SPR-signal (in response units, RU) and plotted against the time in a so-called sensogram (for details, see Gesellchen et al. 2005).",

            "text": "For the immobilization of ligands, several strategies exist. The standard approach is the covalent coupling of a ligand via primary amines (free N-termini or lysine residues) utilizing NHS/EDC (N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide/N-ethyl-N\u2032-dimethylaminopropyl-carbodiimide) chemistry or via thiol groups (Gesellchen et al. 2005). Non-covalent, reversible capturing can be achieved by employing genetically engineered fusion tags (for example, GST (Glutathion S-Transferase), FLAG (DYKDDDDK peptide) or Strep-tag (WSHPQFEK peptide)) once an appropriate binding reagent (antibody), specifically targeted against the fusion tag, has been attached to a sensor chip. Biotinylated molecules can also be captured site-directed on a streptavidin surface with high affinity; however, because of their high affinity, a complete regeneration applying rather mild conditions may be problematic. For reversible capturing of GST-tagged fusion proteins, a commercially available anti-GST antibody (GST capture kit, BR-1002-23, Biacore) is commonly used (Zimmermann et al. 2008). Thus, the interaction pattern and/or the functionality of the fused protein can be influenced by the high molecular weight of the GST-fusion tag (~26 kDa). Proteolytic cleavage of the fusion tag using a specific protease may be a suitable strategy (Terpe 2003) to remove the fusion part still requiring extra steps and may result in loss of protein.",

The first strategy is comprised of reversible, non-covalent binding to a specific NTA (Nitrilotriacetic acid) chip (BR-1004-07, Biacore; (Gershon and Khilko 1995) in the presence of Ni2+ ions; additionally, covalent coupling on those NTA chips can be performed (Willard and Siderovski 2006; Diskar et al. 2007; see also Method section). Slow dissociation from the polyhistidine capturing surface is fundamental for performing a sandwich type binding assay. Reversible binding has to be tested for every His-tagged protein in order to determine if the dissociation rate from the polyhistidine capturing surface is slow enough for subsequent interaction analysis. Insufficient capturing (fast off-rate) of polyhis-tagged proteins is especially problematic when using Ni2+-NTA sensor chips (Herberg, personal communication). Immunotools, that are, antibodies against His6-tagged fusion proteins, may provide an alternative that is superior to the Ni2+-NTA-approach.",

One chip was used to test the two Qiagen antibodies. On the other chip, antibodies from Dianova and Trend Pharma were immobilized. To achieve comparable coupling densities, the antibodies from Qiagen had to be subjected to short-term dialysis (1 h, 4\u00b0C) against the coupling buffer (10 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0) in order to adjust the concentration and pH of the solution. Antibodies (30 \u00b5g ml\u22121) in the coupling buffer were injected for 7 min at a flow rate of 5 \u00b5l min\u22121 over the NHS/EDC-activated surface to generate surface densities of 3060 RU (anti-RGS-(His)4 antibody from Qiagen), 5970 RU (anti-Penta-His antibody from Qiagen) and 14310 RU (anti-(His)6 antibody from Dianova), and 15370 RU (anti-(His)6 antibody from Trend Pharma).Procedure in detail:Insert CM5 sensor chip equilibrate to room temperature into a Biacore instrument and prime the system with running buffer.Start the sensogram and wait until the baseline is stable.Inject 15 \u00b5l 10 mM NaOH (three times) at a flow rate of 30 \u00b5l min\u22121.Decrease the flow rate to 5 \u00b5l min\u22121 and address only the flow cell where the antibody should be immobilized.In most cases, a pH scouting is necessary before trying to couple a protein. By this procedure, one determines the pH and protein concentration at which the electrostatic interaction to the dextran matrix works out best for subsequent immobilization. Therefore, dilute the ligand to concentrations ranging from 1 to 30 \u00b5g ml\u22121 in the coupling buffer with different pH values. Generally, a pH from 4.5 to 5.5 is useful to couple antibodies.Perform short injections (1 min) of the diluted ligand and observe where the electrostatic attraction is suitable to obtain an increase in SPR-signal (RU).Mix the thawed NHS and EDC solution in a 1:1 ratio and inject the mixture for 7 min. After the injection, record an increase in the response signal of 180\u2013250 RU (CM5 chip on a Biacore 2000 system) for the activation of the surface.Inject the ligand stepwise until the desired surface density is reached.Finally, inject ethanolamine hydrochloride for 7 min to quench unreacted esters and to remove non-covalently bound ligand.The control surface (in general flow cell 1) should at least be activated with NHS/EDC and treated afterwards with ethanolamine hydrochloride, as described above.\nApplication notes:The needle and microfluidics cartridge (IFC) have to be rinsed after each injection (extraclean) to avoid a cross-contamination.A sensor chip with an already coupled ligand can be stored at 4\u00b0C under buffer in a 50-ml screw cap tube.\n",

Monitor the baseline to assure the stability of the bound ligand (as slow dissociation).Via short injections (several seconds) of the NiCl2 solution, it is possible to strip minor amounts of the fusion protein from the surface, and by this, fine-tune the surface coverage.For subsequent interaction analysis, direct the non-His-tagged protein (analyte) over both flow cells (reference and the ligand-bound surface) at a flow rate of 30 \u00b5l min\u22121.Inject the analyte, as described (Sect. 42.3.5), but omit subsequent cleaning steps.Remove the analyte and ligand by chelating Ni-ions with a pulse of 350 mM EDTA pH 8,3 (regeneration buffer for NTA surfaces).

This method, in contrast to the standard covalent coupling via primary amines, ensures a site directed immobilisation (N-terminal amine group) and can be performed in physiological buffer conditions (e.g. HBS). Initially, the NTA surface has to be saturated with Ni-ions such as described for the reversible binding of polyhistidine-tagged proteins to the NTA surface (see Sect. 42.3.3). In a second step, coupling via the primary amines is performed.Detailed procedure:Inject NiCl2 (500 \u00b5M) in HBS-EP running buffer for 1 min at a flow rate of 20 \u00b5l per min over only the flow cell where the ligand is to be covalently coupled.Decrease the flow rate to 5 \u00b5l/min and inject the 1:1 NHS/EDC mixture (see Sect. 42.3.2) for 7 min.Subsequently, inject adequate dilutions of polyhistidine-tagged protein in HBS-EP buffer until the surface density of choice is reached.Inject ethanolamine hydrochloride for 7 min.Next, remove Ni-ions and non-covalently coupled proteins and inject the regeneration buffer for NTA surfaces for 3 min at a flow rate of 20 \u00b5l/min.\n",

Dissociation rate constants (k\nd) for each antibody were calculated (see Table 42.2) assuming a 1:1 Langmuir model (BIAevaluation 4.01, Biacore). When comparing the dissociation rate constants of all proteins from the tested antibodies, a reduction in the k\nd value in the order anti-(His)6-antibody (Dianova) > anti-(His)6-antibody (Trend Pharma) > anti-(His)5-antibody (Qiagen) > anti-RGS-(His)4-antibody (Qiagen) was observed demonstrating increased affinity for the epitope (Fig. 42.1). Only in case of the RGS-(His)4-antibody from Qiagen, association with the RGS-(His)6-tagged proteins was very rapid and dissociation very slow (Table 42.2). This suggested that the interaction with the RGS-(His)4-antibody was extremely stable and suited best for a sandwich assay in order to determine binding kinetics with other, non-RGS-(His)6-tagged proteins as analytes (Fig. 42.3). In contrast to the anti-RGS-(His)4-antibody, the anti-penta-His antibody from Qiagen showed a lower capability for capturing, mainly due to the faster dissociation rate (see Table 42.2 and Fig. 42.1). The Tetra-His antibody from Qiagen displayed an even faster off rate for the RGS-(His)6-tagged proteins (Hahnefeld et al. 2004). The antibody distributed by Trend Pharma worked better than the anti-(His)6 antibody from Dianova, that is, the dissociation rate for the RGS-(His)6-tagged proteins was lower, but definitely higher when comparing it even with the anti-penta-His antibody. In general, more than 50% of the bound RGS-(His)6-tagged proteins dissociated in a short period of time from the Dianova antibody (see Fig. 42.1a right panel), thus making the antibody less suitable to capture His-tagged proteins when compared with the other antibodies tested.\n\n",
