We also observed significant decreases in the use of sedative medications in the bCPAP group compared with the conventional ventilation only group. It has long been recognized that a significant portion of the long-term medical burden carried by premature infants is a consequence of therapy, rather than disease. For example, the variation in the risk of CLD among 8 different centers, as first reported by Avery et al,15 was striking, and recent reports have raised the concern that sedative medications may have a deleterious effect on the developing brain.30\u201333 Some research suggests negative long-term neurocognitive side effects with the use of sedative drugs in preterm neonates, particularly in very low birth weight infants.24 Other studies have reported no effect of sedative strategies on infants.31 For these reasons, developing systems of care that are less invasive and which can allow minimization of the use of potentially harmful medications is highly desirable. bCPAP, when properly administered and carefully monitored, is comfortable and well tolerated by the newborn with acute respiratory failure.",
