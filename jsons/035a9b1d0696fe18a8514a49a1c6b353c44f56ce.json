This study proposed a novel deep neural network framework, COVID-19Net, which parallelly 12 combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional gated recurrent units (GRUs). Three 13 European countries with severe outbreaks were studied-Germany, Italy, and Spain-to extract 14 spatiotemporal feature and predict the number of confirmed cases.

The highly contagious nature of 303 COVID-19 and frequent population flows among European countries may result in a strong spatial 304 correlation between their pandemic trends. Therefore, extracting spatial features considerably 305 increased the accuracy of the prediction model. This indicated that features related to changes in the 306 accumulated number of confirmed cases in each country are highly crucial. Based on the parallelly 307 combined 1D-CNN and BiGRUs used for extracting temporal features from Input 1, a 2D-CNN was 308 constructed to extract the spatiotemporal features of the three countries from Input 2 (Fig. 6) .

However, this 394 demand will also depend on social distancing measures implemented and other measures already imposed by 395 each country.

They used nonlinear regression to obtain essential 151 parameter values, summarize the pandemic trend in Hubei, and predict that the pandemic will end in Hubei on 152 March 10.Nishiura et al. [4]  estimated the serial intervals of COVID-19 patients. Using a truncated dataset with 153 days as the unit, they employed a double-interval Bayes likelihood function to estimate serial intervals. Under 154 a 95% confidence interval, their results revealed a mean of 3.9 d between successive cases in a chain of 155 transmission.Tang et al. [5]  used a temporal dynamic model to simulate COVID-19 transmission in China.156Markov chain Monte Carlo methods were used to fit the pandemic data of the country, and Geweke's diagnostic 157 was used to assess model convergence. Their experiment suggested that 58%-76% of contagion sources must 158 be isolated to contain the pandemic.Fan et al. [6]  used data on the population distribution and flow of Wuhan 159 City to predict COVID-19 cases imported from nearby cities and provinces. Their results revealed that the 160 population of other cities or provinces was highly correlated with the daily number of confirmed cases in Wuhan. 161Roosa et al. [7]  predicted pandemic progression by using three mathematical models: a generalized logistic162 growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model. Their results verified that the sub-163 epidemic model most accurately predicted the pandemic situation in Hubei on February 15. Zhong et al. [8] 164 used the susceptible-infected-removed model and epidemic data combined with parameter estimation to 165 estimate the accumulated number of confirmed cases in China. They predicted that the COVID-19 outbreak in 166 China will gradually subside between early May and late June. 167 The Diamond Princess cruise is considered a major epidemic zone of COVID-19 and has received 168 considerable attention from the global community. Nishiura [9] used the infection timeline of the Diamond 169 Princess to back-calculate the incidence rate under a 95% confidence interval and revealed that implementing 170 isolation measures on February 5 reduced the number of confirmed cases to 776. Currently, Internet and big 171 data platforms are gradually improving to incorporate comprehensive functions. This indicates the feasibly of 172 using AI to resolve disease-related problems [10]. For example, in response to the increasing need for resources 173 during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak from China in 2002, Yu et al. [11] used a 174 multitarget and multicycle mixed-integer programming model to determine the optimal allocation and provision 175 of temporary facilities and resources. They used Language for Interactive General Optimizer to optimize facility 176 site selection and suggested that selecting the sites of temporary medical facilities built in late February 177 substantially affects subsequent pandemic prevention. McAleer [12] employed the Global Health Security Index 178 to assess 195 countries worldwide and compared COVID-19 with SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome. 179 The results indicated that the global community could better contain COVID-19 than the other two diseases, 180 with the index score increasing to 51.9. 181 For deep learning, Metsky et al. [13] employed the CRISPR-Cas13 system to compare COVID-19 virus 182 nucleic acid sequences with those of other representative viruses. They also tested various COVID-19 screening 183 methods and identified ADAPT as the most accurate. Guo et al. [14] used a bi-path convolutional neural 184 network (CNN) to construct a virus host prediction model. They used the basic local alignment search tool to 185 compare the gene sequences of two virus hosts and determined that the area under curve approach most 186 accurately described human hosts. Yang et al. [15] combined a long short-term memory (LSTM) model and the 187 Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Resistant (SEIR) model and used the population flow data obtained near January 188 23, 2020 and COVID-19 epidemic parameters to predict the pandemic peak in China. Comparing the prediction 189 curves derived using these two models and that plotted using actual data indicated that the number of infected 190 patients would reach a peak of 4000 between February 4 and February 7. Anastassopoulou et al. [16] used the 191 susceptible-infectious-recovered-dead model to examine the medical data of Hubei acquired between January 192 11 and February 10, 2020 and predict mortality and recovery rates through 95% confidence intervals [17]. Their 193 results showed that the accumulated number of confirmed cases could reach 45 000-180 000 on February 29, 194 and the number of deaths could exceed 2700. Kucharski et al.

On February 22, 2020, Italy imposed lockdowns on 55 multiple cities, and the military was deployed to assist with pandemic prevention 3 days later. Recently, Italy 56 has deployed healthcare personnel across the country to contain the pandemic. Italy's severe situation and its 57 worldwide leading mortality rate may be attributable to the fast spread of the virus and numerous citizens' 58 unwillingness to reduce social activities despite warnings from the government. Meanwhile, an increasing 59 number of countries have implemented strict pandemic prevention measures. After Italy, Spain imposed 60 multiple strict measures in which the central government announced a state of emergency for 14 days, during 61 which all people were requested to remain indoors unless commuting to work or purchasing daily necessities.In addition to schools, which were closed previously, all shops and commercial areas unrelated to sustaining 63 daily necessities were required to cease operation. On March 14, 2020, a lockdown was imposed on Madrid.Madrid, Spain on Saturday, March 14 became the second European country to impose a nationwide lockdown, 65 ordering its 47 million people to mostly stay in their homes as coronavirus cases surge and the government 66 announced that the wife of the Spanish prime minister had tested positive for the virus [2]. Staring from the 67 next day, the police began to use unmanned drones for patrols and ask crowds in parks to leave and remain at 68 home. However, the pandemic in Spain has not subsided. The accumulated number of confirmed cases in Spain 69 has reached 74 386, and this number is higher than that of the five most affected Chinese provinces excluding 70 Hubei combined (i.e., Guangdong, Henan, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Anhui), despite the total population of Spain 71 being 12% of the combined population of these five provinces. The incremental rate of confirmed cases in Spain 72 is also greatly concerning. The accumulated number of confirmed cases was 3146 on March 13, 5232 on March 73 14, and 7753 on March 15, which presents a daily incremental rate of 50%. In addition, the number deaths in Spain reached 288 and a 3.7% mortality rate, which is the highest after that of Italy.On February 9, 2020, Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the Director of the Center for Coordination of Health Alerts and Emergencies in Spain, stated that the country would only have a few confirmed cases. However, a report by the 77 center on March 6 warned that the number of deaths in nearby Italy was increasing rapidly and that the pandemic 78 may spread to Spain. At that time, the number of confirmed cases in Spain was roughly 280, with four deaths.Two weeks later, the number of deaths in Spain exceeded 7000, three times that disclosed by Iran.The statistics 80 reported by the Spanish government on March 30 indicated that 813 people died because of COVID-19 in the 81 past 24 h, which caused the number of deaths in Spain to reach 7340, during which the number of confirmed 82 cases increased by 6398. Consequently, the number of accumulated confirmed cases reached 85 195 in Spain, 83 the third highest number worldwide. The pandemic in Spain appeared to have subsided in the past day. However, 84 a sudden increase in the number of confirmed cases and deaths forced the Spanish government to impose further 85 lockdown measures: Since March 30, all people have been required to remain at home for at least 2 weeks, 86 except for those engaging in essential occupations. On March 11, 2020, the Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, hosted a press conference jointly with Jens Spahn, the Federal Minister of Health, and Lothar Wieler, the President of the Robert Koch Institute.
