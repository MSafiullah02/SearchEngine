Modelling uncertainty was considered using unweighted model averaging. The date of peak rate of deaths was estimated to correspond to the steepest incline in the rate of cumulative deaths. The maximum cumulative number of deaths was estimated for each region (BCUHB, Wales, UK), and the number of deaths to 07/05/2020 was expressed as a percentage of the predicted maximum number of deaths for each region of interest. Figure 1 presents all the recorded daily deaths for the regions of interest. Convergence in the non-linear curve fitting was achieved for all functions other than Richards, which is equivalent to the Gompertz model when d approaches 0. The model parameter estimates, presented in Table 1 , and resulting growth curves depicted in Figure 2 indicated the peak daily death rate in Wales occurred on the 14/04/2020 (range 11/04/2020 to 15/04/2020). Peak daily deaths for the UK occurred on 15/04/2020 (range 12/04/2020 to 20/04/2020) -both indicating that the first peaks for daily deaths have passed. For BCUHB, the peak for daily deaths occurred on the 07/05/2020 (range 02/05/2020 to 26/05/2020). This corresponds to the latest date for which data were available at the time of analysis, meaning that the date of peak daily deaths for BCUHB is highly uncertain, and may not yet have occurred.",

Their approach has been criticised as predictions are extremely labile since new data are included on a daily basis [10] . Neither our model nor the IHME model is a disease transmission model, and this represents a limitation. Although in predicting mortality (as opposed to cases), SEIR compartmental models (representing susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) may be less reliable. Model averaging benefits from possible reduction of predictive error. However the confidence bounds for averaged models are not readily calculable, hence our presentation of the range of outputs from each individual model as a conservative estimate. A further limitation relates to the data, as not all Covid-19 deaths are reported in NHS and Government figures. Estimations of excess mortality in relation to historic data for the months of March to May should provide a more robust estimate, and which are inclusive also of wider impacts of hospital pressures and cancellation of elective procedures.",
