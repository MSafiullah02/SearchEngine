Hong Kong serves as a main gateway for China to the rest of the world and, the close integration and high volume cross-border travel between Hong Kong and the neighbouring Pearl River Delta offers a sharp reminder of the geographical importance of this city as a step stone for the spread of infectious diseases that continue to emerge in South of China.",

The data was entered, cleaned, and analyzed using SPSS (version 13). The chi-square test was used to test the significance of associations between the correspondences and odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to measure the strength of the associations. Independent samples t tests were used to compare anxiety levels in dealing with SARS between the two countries. Multiple logistic regression was applied to obtain adjusted OR (AOR) for anxiety about dealing with SARS (defined as a score of > 5 out of 10 on the visual analogue scale) for the question above and the physician's satisfaction with their government's handling of the epidemic. The Chinese University and University of Toronto Clinical Research Ethics Committees approved this study.",

Relevant and practical training in infection control can be made available to family physicians in the form of continuous medical education. An active and collaborative laboratory surveillance system would integrate frontline laboratories into the public health system to assist detection and control of infectious diseases in the future. Our study also reinforces the recommendations from expert committees in both regions that there is a need for instituting a mechanism for deployment of personnel between institutions. In contrast to these reports, family physicians did not associate loss of income with either readiness to deal with SARS or degree of satisfaction with the governments' handling of the outbreak, suggesting that doctors from both locations were ready to take up the professional and social responsibilities involved to deal with public health emergencies.",
