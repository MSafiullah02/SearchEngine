It is defined as a diffuse injury to the axons in the cerebral hemispheres, the corpus callosum, the brainstem, and, sometimes, the cerebellum, as a result of a TBI. Concurrently, there is vascular injury at a capillary level, which can be seen in the early stages as isolated or multiple hemorrhages at the junction of white and gray matter [3].",

A reduced level of consciousness, with GCS lower with than without DAI, plus the need for orotracheal intubation for airway protection, tachypnea, hypoxia, cardiorespiratory arrest and changes in glycemia are components of the clinical picture. Survivors of the injury often require a prolonged hospital stay, the use of sedatives and other drugs, and neurosurgical approaches, and generally experience worse outcomes than patients with TBI but without DAI. In patients with severe DAI, death is the most common outcome, with the presence, at admission, of hypotension, hypoxia, hyperglycemia, and pupillary changes also predictive of increased mortality [6, 7].",
