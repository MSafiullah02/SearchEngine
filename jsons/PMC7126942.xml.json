            "text": "Rinderpest is an acute, febrile, highly contagious disease of cattle caused by rinderpest virus (RPV), which is a member of the family Paramyxoviridae and genus Morbillivirus. In spite of availability of a highly effective live attenuated vaccine, rinderpest remains a threat to livestock in developing countries. The difficulty in maintaining the cold chain results in failure of vaccination in the hot regions where rinderpest is endemic. Attempts have been made to develop heat stable rinderpest vaccines, which include thermostable Vero cell-adapted rinderpest vaccine [1], [2], Xerovac live attenuated rinderpest vaccine [3] and dry powder rinderpest vaccine [4]. RPV contains two glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (H) and fusion (F) proteins, on its host cell membrane-derived envelope. H and F proteins are known to be highly immunogenic and confer protective immunity. Efforts have been made to develop recombinant vaccinia virus expressing H and F [5], [6], [7], [8], [9] and recently long-term immunity in cattle has also been demonstrated [10], [11]. Because of its wide host range, the use of recombinant vaccinia virus remains a matter of debate. Another pox virus (capripox virus), which has more restricted host range, has been used to develop recombinant capripox\u2013rinderpest virus vaccine [12], [13] and vaccination with this vaccine confers long-term immunity in African cattle [14]. Further, the H and F proteins expressed by recombinant baculo virus was shown to be immunogenic [15] and a recombinant baculo virus expressed H protein could induce both humoral and cell-mediated immune response [16], [17]. In addition, the recombinant H expressed as extracellular baculo virus particles has been shown to elicit cytotoxic T-cell responses and a CTL epitope on H has been mapped [18], [19]. Although the above-mentioned efforts promise to provide an effective vaccine, their use becomes prohibitively expensive because of the cost of production of cell culture vaccine.",

            "text": "In order to effectively control and eliminate rinderpest, a vaccine is necessary which provides a handle to differentiate between animals that have been vaccinated and those, which have recovered from natural infection [20]. For pathogens, which enter and colonize in the mucosal epithelium of gastrointestinal, respiratory and genital tract, it would be better to employ a mucosal vaccine since induction of both mucosal and systemic immune responses is achieved whereas the reverse does not hold true. A recombinant subunit vaccine expressed in edible parts of transgenic plants promises to possess the desired properties. In case of foot and mouth disease and transmissible gastroenteritis, recombinant antigens expressed in transgenic plants have been reported to possess immunological properties at least in the mouse model [21], [22]. We have recently shown that the H protein of RPV expressed in a model plant, tobacco is immunogenic and elicit specific humoral immune response [23]. Further, we have expressed the hemagglutinin protein in transgenic peanut, a crop which is also used in India for animal feeding after harvesting the nuts, and tested its antigenicity and immunogenicity. This peanut-derived H is immunologically active when delivered through parenteral or through oral route in experimental mouse model system [40]. In the present communication, we report the induction of specific immune responses in cattle upon oral feeding with transgenic leaves of peanut expressing H without mucosal adjuvant.",

Homologous and heterologous virus neutralizing ability was absent in serum from the animal fed with vector-transformed peanut leaves.

However, immunization of cattle with recombinant baculovirus expressing H (rECV-H) resulted in a twofold higher titer for both homologous and heterologous virus neutralization titers. Induction of high levels of virus neutralization titer immediately at 1 week post-immunization could be due to the adjuvant activity provided by some plant component. These results demonstrate that antibodies generated upon oral immunization are able to provide protection against RPV or cross-protection against PPRV infections in vitro.",

The antigenicity of peanut-derived H protein was established using specific antibodies and its immunogenicity was analyzed in a mouse model [40]. Oral feeding of transgenic peanut leaves induced specific mucosal (secretory IgA) and systemic immune responses (serum IgG and IgA) and also cell-mediated immune responses. In the present work, induction of immune responses in cattle was monitored upon oral delivery of hemagglutinin protein of rinderpest virus as part of food, without any mucosal adjuvant. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing elicitation of specific immune responses in the host animal by a protective antigen of a Morbillivirus expressed in transgenic plants given orally. Although small quantities of transgenic plant tissues (7.5 g for the first feeding followed by two feedings of 5 g) was given orally, the test animals developed high titer of specific antibodies. These antibodies were able to compete out monoclonal antibodies in ELISA (Fig. 1) demonstrating the specificity of the induced antibodies; in addition, these antibodies neutralized the virus infectivity in vitro. Animals were fed only thrice with plant-derived antigen at weekly intervals, which in addition to production of significant levels of specific antibody, resulted in stimulation of T cells from immunized animals in response to specific antigens (Fig. 3A and B) indicating the induction of systemic immune response upon oral immunization. Wigdorovitz et al. [21] reported induction of protective systemic immune response in the mouse model upon oral feeding of transgenic plants expressing VP1 protein of foot and mouth disease virus. In this work, the VP1 protein expressed in alfalfa plants was not detected by Western blotting and several immunizations (three times a week for 2 months with approximately 0.3 g of leaves) were needed in order to induce a significant immune response. Similarly, Gomez et al. [22] have shown oral immunogenicity of the spike protein of swine-transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus expressed in potato in a mouse model. This group followed almost similar immunization schedule as reported by Wigdorovitz et al. [21]. However, there was no detectable neutralization activity, which was attributed to the post-translational processing in the host plant. Compared to these two reports, in the present work, small quantities of peanut expressed H protein given orally without adjuvant induced high levels of virus neutralizing antibodies.",

            "text": "There are two reports where induction of specific immune response is demonstrated upon oral feeding of human volunteers with potato tubers expressing LT-B of E. coli\n[32] or Norwalk virus capsid protein-assembled as virus like particles [33]. In the first human trials, the antigen used (LT-B) is a well-known mucosal adjuvant and therefore when given through oral route, LT-B antigen induced significant systemic and mucosal immune responses. In the second trial, potato expressing Norwalk virus capsid protein was delivered orally. It has been suggested that the particulate nature of the virus like particles confer greater stability to the antigen in the stomach and resulted in specific immune response although the level of specific serum antibody was modest. Induction of specific immune response in mice upon oral delivery of measles virus hemagglutinin expressed in plant tissues has been demonstrated [34]. The induction of immune responses upon oral delivery shown in the present work might be due to \u201cbioencapsulation\u201d as described by Kong et al. [35]. Modelska et al. [36] have shown that expressed antigen is more immunogenic when plant material is fed orally as compared to the plant proteins present in the extract. Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that components of the plant also influence the immunogenicity of the antigen expressed [22]. The induction of serum or mucosal antibody response to orally administered antigens is often difficult and generally requires large quantities of antigen as only part of the antigen is being absorbed and is capable of eliciting an immune response. It was assumed that co-administration of a mucosal adjuvant is necessary to achieve optimum oral immunogenicity for a given antigen. Furthermore, the presentation of large amount of antigen may lead to oral tolerance and use of mucosal adjuvant will result in non-specific stimulation of mucosal immune system. de Aizpurua and Russell-Jones [37] have identified the class of proteins that provoke an immune response upon oral feeding and concluded that all the proteins that possess \u201clectin or lectin-like\u201d binding activities are active in oral immunization. These molecules have the ability to bind to glycolipids or glycoproteins on the intestinal mucosae and thus transported across the epithelial barrier, to enter the circulation and elicit an immune response. More recently, plant lectins with different sugar specificities have been investigated for mucosal immunogenicity [38] and elicitation of specific systemic and mucosal antibody response was observed upon intranasal or oral administration. Since hemagglutinin protein of RPV is a cell attachment protein which binds to cell surface oligosaccharide containing protein or glycoconjugate in order for the virus to begin the infection process, it qualifies to be in the categories of antigens having \u201clectin or lectin-like\u201d activities. Therefore, it is conceivable that H protein may be transported across the epithelial barrier easily through the mechanism described by Lavelle et al. [38] and leading to systemic immune responses. It remains to be seen if this protein expressed in peanut plants elicits a mucosal immune response upon oral immunization.",

Since most part of the world is declared rinderpest-free, use of time tested live attenuated vaccine is restricted. And the infection cannot be diagnosed at an early stage since there is no simple test to differentiate between animals vaccinated with currently used vaccine and infected animals. The recombinant subunit oral vaccine expressed in plants is useful not only in differentiating vaccinated and infected animals but also offers a cost-effective means of mass vaccination by production of transgenic plants expressing the vaccine antigen in developing countries. In addition, it will have the advantage provided by an oral vaccine which results in induction of both mucosal and systemic immune responses better achieved through oral administration as compared to parenteral delivery of the antigen and may help in the first line of defense at the mucosal surfaces. Although we have not carried out any challenge experiments due to lack of high disease security and containment facilities, in vitro neutralization demonstrated the protective capability of the induced antibodies and priming of T cells, which are also involved in rinderpest immunity [15] and therefore the present work clearly demonstrates the potential of edible oral vaccine against rinderpest.",
