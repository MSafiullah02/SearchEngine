A consortium of foreign experts collaborating with Chinese colleagues of various specializations has sought to hold on this outbreak6. The first infected cases were associated with a food market in Wuhan1. Coronaviruses have enveloped, positive sense single-stranded RNA genome, infecting humans and a wide range of animals. They were for the first time characterized and cultured by Tyrell and Bynoe in 1966, from patients with flu and common cold7. They were known as coronaviruses, based on their morphology as spherical virions with a central shell and surface projections identical to a solar corona (Latin: corona means crown)8. There are four separate subfamilies, the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta coronaviruses. Alpha and beta coronaviruses appear to come from mammals, especially from bats, whereas gamma and delta coronaviruses derive from pigs and birds9. The genome length ranges from 26kb to 32kb. Among the seven subtypes of coronavirus that may have the ability to infect humans the beta-coronavirus is considered the most dangerous; this is the one that causes significant morbidity and mortality in humans. SARS-CoV-2 virus belongs to the genus beta-coronavirus9,10.",

Therefore, this virus was initially named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Coronavirus is a RNA based enveloped entity named for its 9-12 nm long surface spikes for solar corona presence15. The coronaviral genome enclosed in the envelope bears four main structural proteins, including the spike protein (S), which binds to the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and then mediates a fusion between the envelope and the cell membranes in the host cell to enable the virus reach to host cell16,17. On February 11, 2020 focused on phylogeny, taxonomy, and defining procedure, by the International Committee for Taxonomy of viruses a Coronavirus Study Group officially classified it as a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)18. Shortly, WHO named the disease caused by this virus coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)19. According to the current evidence, COVID-19 could initially be transmitted by bats and could be transferred to humans by means of pangolins20, or other wildlife sold on the maritime market in Huanan, but later propagated by human to human transmission14 , although other possibilities of transmission are not yet excluded.",

It looks like it begins with a fever and leads to dry coughing. One week after infection the conditions become harsh and lead to breath shortening with approximately 20% of patients requiring hospital treatment and medication29. The COVID-19 illness appears to seldom induce runny nose, sneezing or sore throat (only around 5% of patients have such symptoms). Painful throat sneezing, and stuffy nose are typically symptoms of seasonal flu or cold39,40. A few patients may develop pain or hemoptysis and many may also be completely asymptomatic24,41. Older people with comorbidity and serious alveolar injury are more prone to experience respiratory failure42. The onset of disease will demonstrate rapid progression to organ dysfunction (e.g., acute kidney injury, shock, acute cardiac injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS) and death in severe cases41. Sometime patients might develop lower or normal white blood cell count, thrombocytopenia or lymphopenia, with increased C-reactive protein level and extended activated thromboplastin time24,41,42. 80% of infected cases are found to be mild, with normal fever and flu and the patients can recover at home. In short, a patient having upper respiratory tract symptoms and fever with leukopenia or lymphopenia should be suspected (Table 7, Table 8, Table 9).",

Therefore, ethical trial approval is necessary, and ethically justifiable as the best treatment available (i.e. off-label). Additional information on chloroquine\u2019s effects and usefulness for the treatment of COVID-19 patients will soon be published due to its experimental use in the emerging outbreak. Due to the high number of patients infected and the lack of approved drugs, timely release of this information may be critical. The WHO confirms that there is currently no evidence from randomized control trials to warn about specific COVID-19 drug treatments and that unlicensed therapies can only be performed in the sense of ethically-approved clinical trials or under strict supervision of the Controlled Emergency Use of Unregistered Procedures System (MEURI). Meanwhile, the recommendations for \u201cClinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) infection is suspected\u201d59. The authors tend to agree with this viewpoint of WHO to view chloroquine as experimental. The outbreak is not the perfect environment for doing so, but even the use of chloroquine off-label can be followed by many concerns; the first being the health of patients, which should be followed by close supervision. The ethical approach to off-label drug use also varies from country to country, raising concerns regarding equity. Off-label drug use could cause severe medication shortages when needed for malaria, since chloroquine remains a crucial medication in the treatment of malaria in many parts of the world60.",
