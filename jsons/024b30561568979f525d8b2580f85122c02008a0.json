The last equation is not needed as s(t) + i(t) + r(t) = 1. The basic reproduction number R 0 = \u03b2/\u03b1. This model is simplistic, e.g. because it assumes exponentially-distributed dwell times in the compartments and ignores differences in behaviour arising from demographics. However, this model is more than a 'toy' model, and can be used to make quite useful predictions of the course of of epidemics. For example, for SIR models, a final size relation can be derived, which is a nonlinear equation for s \u221e , the proportion who remain uninfected when the epidemic is over. Starting with a susceptible population, the formula is",

The model or a more sophisticated one could be formally or informally fitted to data and the effective value of \u03b3 estimated. That would give the likely course of the epidemic.
