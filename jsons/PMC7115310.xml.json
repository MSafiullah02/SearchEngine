She self-medicated herself with amoxicillin with no significant improvement. On August 7, she came back to SA, and on August 10, she was seen at the employee health clinic for evaluation. Given her recent arrival from a nonendemic country, screening for MERS-CoV was not considered. On August 11, she was allowed to resume work despite being symptomatic with dry cough and shortness of breath. On August 12, she was admitted as a suspected tuberculosis vs MERS-CoV infection. On the following day, MERS-CoV test was positive (cycle threshold [Ct] values of upE gene = 35, and ORF1a gene = 34), and she also tested positive for tuberculosis.17\n",

The transmission dynamics suggest that the transmission occurred within the setting of the hospital and in the housing environment. These findings highlight the importance of continued vigilance and detailed systematic screening of exposed HCWs whether they are symptomatic or not. Such an activity is very complex, and often it is difficult to elucidate the exact contact pattern between HCWs because of the extensive social interaction within the hospital and housing among different HCWs from different units. In addition, there are difficulties in relying on HCW's memory of exact contacts and infection control precautions taken during that contact.",

Because the diagnosis of MERS had occurred many weeks after several negative MERS swabs, the exact source of the infection could not be determined. In the South Korean MERS-CoV outbreak, 5 patients with MERS-CoV had unclear infection sources.15 During the outbreak investigation, there were 4 spreaders (transmitting MERS to \u22651 individuals), and 1 possibly was a superspreader (transmitted the virus to 4 HCWs). In the South Korean outbreak, superspreader was arbitrarily defined as transmission of MERS-CoV to \u22655 cases.15 However, the exact definition of superspreader is not well established.18 The characteristics of the index case of an infectious disease outbreak potentially influence the transmission dynamics.

This is in sharp contrast with the recent report from South Korea were none of 82 contacts of asymptomatic patients turned out to be positive.26 Although, the Ct value of the index case was high, the index case was able to infect an additional 4 cases.

The current guidelines from the Saudi Ministry of Health do not advocate routine MERS-CoV testing of asymptomatic contacts and advocate the return to normal duty. However, the guidelines stress the need for testing of all the HCWs involved in high-risk unprotected exposure. High-risk exposure is defined as \u201ccontact with confirmed MERS-CoV case within 1.5 meters for > 10 minutes.\u201d Those who are asymptomatic should have only 1 test.28 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that asymptomatic HCWs do not get routine MERS-CoV testing.29 During an outbreak investigation, HCWs with no symptoms were allowed to work with active monitoring and to be excluded from work if they develop MERS-CoV\u2013like symptoms.30 The index case acquired MERS-CoV from the community, and she had concomitant tuberculosis with MERS-CoV. The coinfection might have contributed to increased infectiveness because of coughing and damaged lung tissue. The World Health Organization recommends testing all contacts in health care\u2013associated outbreaks regardless of the development of symptoms.31 In addition, the World Health Organization recommends that asymptomatic HCWs with positive MERS-CoV by polymerase chain reaction should be isolated. The HCWs can return to work when 2 consecutive upper respiratory tract samples taken at least 24 hours apart are negative on real-time polymerase chain reaction.32 In this study, 43% had contact <1.5 m, 57% had contact <10 minutes, and 43% had high-risk contact (<1.5 m and >10 minutes contact).33 Therefore, of those positive, only 43% had high-risk exposure. Therefore, this definition alone may not be sufficient to exclude HCWs from testing. In a study of 9 HCWs who had contact within 0.91-1.83 meters of a MERS-CoV patient, only 1 of them was positive for MERS-CoV.34 In another study, all HCWs' contacts reported 100% compliance with personal protective equipment, and none were positive. In a study of 48 HCWs' contacts, none had serologic evidence of MERS-CoV infection.22 However, the largest screening of MERS-CoV among HCWs showed a positive rate of 1.1% among 1,695 HCWs.35 In the SARS era, asymptomatic patients were culture negative for SARS.36 Therefore, it is not clear if asymptomatic MERS-CoV patients behave similarly to SARS patients.",
