Many patients with ILD can develop an acute exacerbation in the course of the disease (AE-ILD), and often require ICU hospitalization and mechanical ventilation (MV). Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common and severe form of idiopathic ILD, often worsened by acute exacerbation episodes (AE-IPF). During these dramatic events, the typical usual interstitial pneumonia pattern (UIP)\u2014the radiologic and histologic hallmark of IPF is overlapped with diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), sharing similarities with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [3].

            "text": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) consists of a complex network of protein structures (collagen, fibronectin, elastin, glycoproteins and proteoglycans), which play a crucial role in determining the mechanical stability and elastic recoil of the lung. The ECM is a dynamic structure, constantly remodeled by enzymatic processes. In the fibrotic lung, there is a dysregulation of this remodeling process, with imbalance between protein secretion and degradation, with an increase in the deposition of collagen, elastin, proteoglycans and fibronectin [5]. Considering that the main stress-bearing constituents of lung tissue are collagen and elastin fibers, their quantitative and architectural modification can influence the elastic recoil of the lung. Elastin and collagen differ significantly in their mechanical properties. In fact, elastin is responsible for elasticity, especially at low stress levels, and can be stretched by more than 250% of its original length before breaking, while collagen is more rigid and significantly less stretchable being extendable only by 1\u20132% compared to the initial length [6]. Collagen fibers, which in the resting position are folded, are stretched only at high pulmonary volumes, close to the total lung capacity, and act as a blocking system determining the limitation of distention of the lung, and the origin of the curvilinear stress\u2013strain relationship [7, 8] (Fig. 1). Therefore, elastin fibers are the main determinants of the maximum pulmonary volume that can be reached during inflation, beyond which there is a risk of barotrauma and volutrauma due to the breakdown of collagen fibers. This concept can be applied not only to the entire lung, but also to the different lung regions that have their maximum total regional capacity [7]. This is particularly relevant in the fibrotic lung, where the composition of the ECM has a high regional heterogeneity. In IPF, collagen fibers accumulate around myofibroblasts in fibroblastic foci, stiffening the corresponding regions [9].\n",

The histopathological hallmarks of the UIP pattern are spatial heterogeneity, temporal heterogeneity with fibroblastic foci and micro-honeycombing. Spatial heterogeneity is defined as the presence of areas of normal tissue interposed to areas with fibrotic alterations. Temporal heterogeneity is the concomitant presence of areas with only slight modifications of the ECM structure and proliferative fibroblast and myofibroblasts aggregates, adjacent to areas of intense fibrosis composed of dense acellular collagen, indicating different coexisting stages of the disease. Honeycomb lesions are areas consisting of dilated air spaces with anelastic walls of epithelium-coated fibrous tissue [10].

The effect that is determined in some areas of the lung is similar to that shown in stress balls called \u2018squishy balls\u2019 (Figs. 1 and 2). When the squishy ball is compressed, the increase of the pressure inside the object causes throttling of the elastic part of the body through the inelastic net that wraps the ball. The result is the formation of vesicles that protrude outside the net mesh, until reaching the elastic limit. The \u201csquishy ball effect\u201d in some areas of the lung may be the cause of mechanical disadvantages achieved using high Pairway and PL in the lungs with fibrosis and could confirm the role of static strain in generating VILI. Moreover, when the most recruitable areas are subject to high PL, the subsequent overinflation is exacerbated by the mechanical geometry of the fibrotic lung as the anelastic areas act as stress raisers.\n",

Clinical trials in ARDS investigated the effect of an open lung strategy, namely involving the use of PEEP levels higher than those strictly required to maintain acceptable oxygenation [21], often in conjunction with recruitment maneuvers to maximize lung aeration [22]. Such studies have not been able to show clear advantages in terms of outcome compared to ventilation with lower PEEP levels. Furthermore, an aggressive recruitment strategy used in one study resulted even in increased mortality [23]. Some authors started to suggest that lung pressures, including PEEP, should be minimized to reduce VILI in patients with injured and non-injured lungs [24\u201326]; these concepts seem to be promising also for fibrotic lungs where susceptibility to VILI is particularly high.",

Nevertheless, evidence shows that also patients with ILD other than IPF may present with acute exacerbation during the natural course of the disease [33] requiring ICU admission and MV [15, 33, 34]. Autopsy studies show that the majority of patients who died from AE-ILD other than IPF often present with a DAD superimposed on a UIP pattern at the histologic examination, resembling what usually is found on biopsies of patients that died from AE-IPF [34, 35]. The presence of a UIP pattern on histology is strictly correlated with peculiar features on CT scan, namely radiological UIP pattern [33].

The radiologic hallmark of UIP is the presence of honeycombing, multiple layers of sub-pleural clustered cystic airspaces with thick, well-defined walls and typically consistent diameter (3\u201310 mm, but occasionally larger). A fine reticular pattern containing traction bronchiectasis ranging from subtle irregularity of the bronchial/bronchiolar wall to marked airway distortion and varicosity is another key feature of UIP pattern. The typical distribution of these abnormalities follows a cranio-caudal gradient with sub-pleural predominance [36]. Ground-glass opacifications as defined by hazy increased opacity of lung airspaces with substantial preservation of the bronchial and vascular margins on CT, represent the usual radiological appearance of inflammatory alveolar abnormalities, including DAD [37] but may be also present in patients with ILD [38]. When ground-glass opacifications result superimposed on a fine reticular pattern surrounded by traction bronchiectasis they should be referred to alveolar fibrosis and might identify a subgroup of patients at extremely high risk of VILI [39]. In summary, in the context of ILD of different etiology, the presence of a UIP pattern identifies a mechanical substrate more prone to VILI as a consequence of the \u201csquishy ball\u201d behavior. In this setting a lung resting approach might be preferable to prevent possible damages. In AE-ILD patients with ground-glass abnormalities in the absence of significant UIP pattern, mechanical behavior of the lung might be similar to ARDS.",

All patients presented a UIP pattern with superimposed ground-glass opacities on the CT scan (Fig. 3a). Patients were non-obese males (body mass index, mean \u00b1 standard deviation of 22.8 \u00b1 2.3 kg/m2), aged 62.6 \u00b1 9.1 (age at diagnosis 60 \u00b1 8.5 years). All patients underwent transpulmonary pressure monitoring with esophageal manometry (Fig. 3b). Table 1 shows respiratory mechanics and gas exchange parameters of these patients, when PEEP was set according to a \u201clung resting strategy\u201d (minimal PEEP level of 4 cmH2O) and after PEEP titration on an \u201copen lung approach\u201d aiming at achieving positive end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure values. In all patients, with minimal levels of PEEP aimed at achieving minimal acceptable oxygenation, end-expiratory PL was negative. This suggests that even in the fibrotic lung with diffuse alveolar damage tidal de-recruitment of the dependent zones during the expiration might occur. Nevertheless, in these patients a PEEP titration strategy to maintain a positive end-expiratory PL resulted in a significant mechanical disadvantage. In these patients, higher PEEP levels lead to an increase in the driving pressure, lung elastance and end-inspiration PL values. This suggest that PEEP is able to counteract alveolar recruitment\u2013derecruitment, but at the price of a remarkable lung parenchymal stress. The mechanical disadvantages determined by high PEEP, suggests that in the fibrotic lung with diffuse alveolar damage, the static strain might play a relevant role.\n",

The lack of studies defining the mechanical ventilation strategy, and the different underlying etiologies, make it difficult to decide which patient can benefit from ICU admission and MV. The few data that are available show that the prognosis of patients with non-IPF pulmonary fibrosis subjected to MV is dependent on the degree of extensive fibrosis present on CT scan, rather than the underlying etiology. The architecture of the fibrotic lung makes it particularly fragile when subjected to high PEEP. The presence of conserved lung areas, next to areas of dense anelastic fibrosis, does not prevent the phenomenon of alveolar recruitment\u2013derecruitment during tidal volume. The use of high PEEP to keep alveolar units opened during expiration exposes the lung at risk of injury by forming \u201csquishy ball\u201d lung areas that aggravate the end-inspiratory transpulmonary pressure effects. Pending further studies to define the optimal strategy to ventilate these lungs, we herein suggest using a \u201clung resting strategy\u201d, as opposed to \u201copen lung approach\u201d in patients affected by pulmonary fibrosis and UIP pattern under MV, regardless of the underlying etiology.",
