            "text": "Acute bronchitis Acute bronchitis is often defined as an inflammation of the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles due to a respiratory tract infection or the presence of chemical irritants. It is the most common lower respiratory ailment in adults and the ninth most common reason adults seek care in an ambulatory setting [ 1] . The cause of acute bronchitis is often viral in nature and, when a definite cause is determined, the most common culprits are influenza A and B, parainfluenza, coronavirus (types 1-3), rhinovirus, and adenovirus (2, 3] . Less common documented causes include Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, the Taiwan acute respiratory strain of C. psittaci, and Bordetella pertussis infection (Table 1) [ 4] . More frequently occurring in the winter months, upper respiratory symptoms such as coryza, nasal congestion, malaise, myalgias, and sore throat commonly precede its occurrence. Acute bronchitis usually presents with a cough lasting less than 3 weeks as its only symptom. This cough is initially dry and nonproductive but can become progressively productive of more viscous, mucoid sputum in subsequent days. In one out of four cases, the acute bronchitis cough lasts beyond a period of 3 weeks. When the length of duration of the athlete's cough extends beyond this length of time, it is often necessary for the physician to consider additional etiologies as to the cause of the cough. Additional considerations should include postnasal drip, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Patients will sometimes complain of a burning substernal chest pain aggravated with coughing, deep inspiration, and movement. Physical examination usually yields few specific signs for diagnosis. Occasionally, scattered rhonchi will be appreciated on auscultation with or without crackles or rales at the lung bases. In some instances, wheezing may also be present, occurring more often after the patient coughs. Patients may exhibit a slight fever or may be afebrile. These signs and symptoms, along with a history of recent upper respiratory infection, are often sufficient for diagnosis with no additional workup or testing required [2, 3] . Chest films often appear normal and Lower Respiratory Infections and Potential Complications in Athletes Lorenc and Kernan 81 findings, when present, are often minimal and similar to those seen is asthmatics (atelectasis, hyperinflation, peribronchial thickening) [ 5 I.",

            "text": "Treatment of athletes with acute bronchitis usually entails symptomatic treatment and temporary suspension of training/playing activity to enhance convalescence. If the patient is a smoker, cessation should be a primary goal because symptoms are often prolonged and more severe in the smoking population. Given the common viral etiology of acute bronchitis, patients will often present with common cold symptoms and receive relief through treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or nasal decongestants. For a chronic persistent cough, relief can often be obtained with a cough suppressant [ 4 I. Because acute bronchitis and asthma share similar pulmonary findings, (ie, bronchial inflammatory changes) bronchodilators, specifically 13-2 agonists, have been studied. They relieve coughing within 1 week when compared with placebo in patients who are given inhaled albuterol (two puffs four times daily), oral albuterol {4 mg four times daily) or fenoterol (not available in the United States) (61. In patients with continued cough despite bronchodilator therapy, inhaled corticosteroids may be of benefit. This is due to the fact that frequent and repetitive use of 13-2 agonists has been associated with 13-2 receptor subsensitivity and down-regulation. These processes are reversed with corticosteroids [ 5 I. Antihistamines should be avoided to prevent inspissation of secretions. Vitamins C and E in addition to zinc and echinacea have been studied for their effectiveness in treating common cold symptoms, but no conclusive evidence has been elicited proving their benefit (7-101. During febrile periods, it is often recommended that athletes consume about 3 to 4 liters of fluids to maintain adequate hydration status and decrease viscosity of respiratory secretions (11 I. In athletes with lower respiratory tract infections, the secretion of antidiuretic hormone is elevated. In the presence of recommended increased fluid intake during illness, this phenomenon can predispose the athlete to developing hyponatremia in certain instances and should be a source of vigilance for the treating physician. In some cases, less common microorganisms such as Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, and Bordetella species are determined as the cause of symptoms. Arguments have been made for treating athletes with bronchitis with antibiotics to which these organisms are susceptible, specifically tetracyclines, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones in the case of Mycoplasma and Chlamydia infection, and macrolides or sulfonamides in the case ofBordetella infection. In cases of Bordetella infection, 1 to 2 g of erythromycin four times a day for 14 days or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole double strength can be given twice a day for 14 days. However, despite this information, these antibiotics are not routinely prescribed for treatment of infection with Mycoplasma and Chlamydia organisms because there is insufficient quality evidence to support the notion that these interventions are beneficial. Also, in many cases, an etiologic agent is often not identified, therefore antibiotics are not routinely recommended in an effort to decrease the likelihood of perpetuating drug resistance in bacteria [ 2 I.",

Patients presenting with these additional symptoms require a chest radiograph for accurate diagnosis of pneumonia. Radiologic findings will often consist of thickened bronchial shadows with areas of infiltration and atelectasis. Less common findings will include hilar adenopathy, nodular infiltrates, and pleural effusions. Depending on the etiological agent, empyema may also be detected. In cases of pneumonia, it is recommended that sputum Gram stain and culture be obtained to determine the specific cause.",

The increased intrathoracic and intrapleural pressure associated with coughing has been shown in some cases to increase the likelihood of occurrence [ 15) . Spontaneous pneumothorax is often seen in males in their late teens to late 30s who are of a generally taller and slender build. Athletes who smoke and those who abuse inhaled substances are also at an increased risk, with light smokers (defined as 1-12 cigarettes per day) having a relative risk of occurrence seven times higher than the general population [15] [16] [17] . Athletes with documented connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome (most commonly seen in tall, slender basketball and volleyball players) are also at increased risk for occurrence [ 4) .",

Should the pneumothorax be complicated by tension upon the mediastinum, more evident signs will be present including tracheal deviation to the affected side, decreased blood pressure, tachypnea, and cyanosis. These clinical signs make the diagnosis of tension pneumothorax easier; however, this situation is life threatening and requires immediate intervention with simple aspiration or tube thoracostomy to equalize intrathoracic pressure.",

Pneumothoraces occupying an area greater than 15% of the pleural space are often managed in a hospital setting and treated via simple aspiration or tube thoracostomy with or without instillation of a pleurodesis agent in the form of intrapleurally injected tetracycline, doxycycline derivate, or talc slurry.

To accurately diagnose bronchiectasis after recent lower respiratory infection, patients will often need chest imaging. Plain chest films will reveal airway dilatation appearing as tram-tracking or end-on ring shadows in lung fields. Mucopurulent plugs or obstruction due to other debris with postobstructive air-trapping is often noted, appearing as irregular peripheral opacities. If plain films are relatively normal in appearance, high-resolution CT scans of the chest will provide a more definitive diagnosis. In addition to these findings, scans will also show a lack of tapering of bronchi in the presence of bronchial dilatation, which is more specific for bronchiectasis. Airways of affected athletes will often be inflamed, edematous, and possibly cratered or ulcerated [18] . Irritation of the airways causes hypertrophy and tortuosity of the bronchial arteries that run along branches of the bronchial tree. The increased intrapleural pressures and forces associated with coughing increases the possibility of hemoptysis resulting from structural compromise of these arteries [ 19] . For patients with bronchiectasis uncomplicated by hemoptysis, treatment is often centered on the principle of adequate pulmonary hygiene. Although many forms of pulmonary hygiene are currently in use, the most common is general hydration with oral liquids and nebulization with hypertonic saline solutions or mucolytic agents [20] . Given the inflammatory mechanism behind bronchiectasis following bronchitis and pneumonia, bronchodilators and corticosteroids have also been suggested as possible remedies. Studies exploring the efficacy of bronchodilators to treat bronchiectasis are lacking. Steroids have been shown to cause some degree of immunosuppression when prescribed [18, 21, 22] . This relative compromise in immune function can lead to potential worsening of the condition the steroids were used to treat.",

The blood produced will often be minimal and present as blood-tinged or streaked sputum. In the unfortunate circumstance of massive hemoptysis due to bronchial arterial rupture, the most important initial treatment is ensuring a protected airway by inserting a large-bore endotracheal tube. Having secured an adequate airway, management can then focus on treatment of the source of bleeding with initial intervention in the form of bronchoscopy with balloon tamponade of the compromised vasculature. If this intervention fails, resolution is then sought with arterial embolization of the affected vessels followed potentially by resection of affected lung tissue if unresolved [ 23] .",

Return to play considerations will often hinge on the etiologic agent causing the athlete's symptoms and the length of time the athlete is considered contagious. In cases in which athletes do receive antibiotic treatment, there is no reported documentation limiting return to play. An additional consideration when determining an athlete's ability to return to play is the \"neck check\" put forth by Eichner. The guideline states that if patient's respiratory symptoms are mainly above the neck ( eg, coryza, sneezing, and headache), then the athlete may return to play. If, however, patient symptoms are confined below the neck ( eg, fever, cough, myalgias), strenuous activity should be restricted until the symptoms resolve [25] . For athletes returning to play, caution should be taken to prevent them from returning too fast and incurring additional illness. Intense exercise can increase the severity of viral illness during recovery and manifest as muscle impairment of skeletal, respiratory, or cardiac muscle strength and function. This impairment can trigger such complications as activation of latent reactive airway disease, myocarditis and musculoskeletal injury resulting from impaired mechanics [26] .",

Athletes treated with more invasive procedures such as thoracotomy can resume participation in all sports after a period of 2 to 4 weeks [15, 27] . During recovery, athletes should be appropriately counseled regarding the risk of possible recurrence given that the incidence of such occurrence averages 30%.
