            "text": "\nB. bassiana is the most appreciated endophytic fungal entomopathogen to date, with a widespread commercial availability as a potent mycopesticide. The fungus establishes itself as an endophyte either naturally, e.g., by stomatal penetration, or with the aid of inoculation methods such as soil drenches, seed coatings and immersions, radicle dressings, root and rhizome immersions, stem injection, and foliar and flower sprays. Hence, it is widely acknowledged as a success in a variety of plants such as grasses; agricultural crops, viz., tomato, cotton, corn, and potato; the medicinal group including opium poppy, cocoa, and coffee; and trees such as Carpinus caroliniana and western white pine (Vega et al. 2008; Ownley et al. 2008). The most preferred protocol for endophytic colonization of B. bassiana includes the use of formulations augmented with solid inert carriers or diluents such as diatomaceous earth, talc, clay, vermiculite, corn cob grits, and alginate gels (Wagner and Lewis 2000; Parsa et al. 2013). Irrespective of the multifarious inoculation techniques, the extent of colonization depends on the type of plant part evaluated, the inoculation method used, and the initial spore density on the plant tissue (Posada et al. 2007; Ownley et al. 2008). While leaves respond best to foliar sprays, roots colonize only to drench inoculation with stems responding equally to both forms. A plausible yet untested hypothesis suggests that the extent of endophytic colonization correlates positively with the extent of endophyte-mediated resistance by the host.",

The spores of B. bassiana have a high affinity for the female Anopheles mosquito. However, for proper infestation, spore sufficiency and direct contact with the insect is required so that the fungus can efficiently penetrate and germinate the insect cuticle. Female Anopheles stephensi, the causal agent of human malaria in Asia, relishes on the dead and dying caterpillars heavily infested with B. bassiana, thereby letting themselves be infested in turn with this fungus. George et al. (2013) premiered a caterpillar sans innovative technique of using oil-formulated dried spores sprayed on a cloth that resulted in the fungal infestation efficiency of 95 % in the mosquitoes. However, the utility of B. bassiana larvicide can be good when we have regulated resistance in bacterial Bacillus sphaericus and chemical larvicides.",

Moreover, it also showed potent application against mealybugs, spider mites, and other foliar insects. The mode of application involves prilling of the mycelia as it assures the retention of the biological activity of the product until application. At the time of application, the dried prill is reactivated post-wetting and further used for treating soil, seed, root, or plant (Eyal et al. 1994). In addition, the amendment with food attractants or vegetable oils rich in oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acids in bioformulation has proved a robust application in stimulation of necrophagy (Jackson et al. 2010).",

The added advantage of using endophytic isolates is that they posses tolerance against environmental stresses, such as UV, high temperature, rainfall, etc. The fungal strain grows along with the host, and its additional entomopathogenic quality renders a substantial lifelong protection to the host plants, particularly to agriculture crops.

Fungi are comparatively more tolerant to heavy-metal stress and thrive well in the acidified environment owing to their adaptation of several strategies of rendering the metal ions into innocuous forms. Hence, their use in bioremediation of industrial effluents and wastewaters containing heavy metals has been reported globally (Rajapaksha et al. 2004). The main principle for bioremediation is biosorption that primarily utilizes amino, carboxyl, hydroxyl, and carbonyl groups of the cell wall for metal binding as elucidated by FTIR analysis. A plethora of fungal species, such as Aspergillus niger, Mucor rouxii, Rhizopus spp., etc., have been reported to be utilized in heavy-metal remediation. Besides this, B. bassiana is reported to efficiently adsorb Cd and Pb from aqueous metal solutions. Physicochemical factors like solution pH and contact time at room temperature positively affected the rate of metal biosorption (Tomko et al. 2006).",

Fungal metal leaching is promoted by proton efflux or metabolites with chelating properties.

B. bassiana is reported to be endowed with the ability of heavy-metal chelation using oxalates as organic chelators. The beauverial oxalate reportedly chelates a variety of metals, involving iron (iron oxalates were directly sequestered on the fungal hyphae), copper (formation of characteristic \u201cLiesegang rings\u201d due to simultaneous diffusion and precipitation of copper oxalates), and silver (coprecipitation of copper and silver oxalates) (Joseph et al. 2012).",

The protein exhibits a monomeric structure with a molecular weight of 60 kDa and an isoelectric point of 9.5. It shows an amino acid sequence homology to the yeast chitin-binding protein, but its chitin-binding properties have not yet been determined. Being neutral for ion exchangers, bassiacridin actively participates in \u03b2-glucosidase, \u03b2-galactosidase, and N-acetylglucosaminidase activities. Fourth-instar nymphs of Locusta migratoria injected with the protein even at low dosage expressed a mortality rate of about 50 %. The root cause of mortality as revealed by the ultrastructural studies showed melanin pigmentation in the trachea, air sacs and a formation of melanized nodules on the fat bodies leading to an alteration of the epithelial cell structure of the trachea, air-bags, and integuments, thereby turning them necrotic. However, these structural changes were not reported to be caused by hemolymph pigmentation with the simultaneous production of toxic quinones. The pigmentation activity was carried out by the enzyme prophenoloxidase, activated by bassiacridin. Being novel, research needs to be targeted on the understanding of the mechanism of interaction of bassiacridin with host cells and its impact on the environment so as to include the protein as an active ingredient of biopesticides (Quesada-Moraga and Vey 2004).",

Comparative sequence analysis of bassianolide synthetase (BbBSLS) suggested the presence of catalytic domains intermediate from d-2-hydroxyisovalerate and l-leucine, responsible for the iterative synthesis of dipeptidol monomer, d-hydroxyisovalerate (d-Hiv) N-methyl-l-leucine (N-Me-Leu) bound to the enzyme. Post synthesis, these domains catalyze the condensation of the monomers to form the octadepsipeptide with a 24-membered macrolactone ring. This structure further isomerizes to the final cyclic tetrameric ester form (Suzuki et al. 1977). Comparative in vitro infection studies against selected insect host establish bassianolide as a highly significant virulence factor of B. bassiana, inducing atony to the larvae of H. zea and toxicity to silkworm larvae. Knockout mutants with a targeted disruption of bbBsls gene were unable to produce bassianolide and showed a drastic reduction in virulence against the model insects Galleria mellonella and H. zea. However, B. bassiana orchestrates a definite strategy for carrying out the killing operation of insect larvae in which the metabolite production coincides with the host infection. Thus, bassianolide represents a bona fide virulence factor of the entomopathogen significantly contributing to the commercial biological insecticide preparation containing the spores of the fungus. Besides being a potent insecticide, purified bassianolide inhibits the acetylcholine-induced smooth muscle contraction, as well as displays in vitro cytotoxic, moderate antiplasmodial and antimycobacterial activities (Jirakkakul et al. 2008).",

Stress, in any form, be it UV, heat, or drought, induces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which damages the essential biomolecules, like DNA, proteins, and lipids. Fungal enzymes, particularly superoxide dismutases (SODs) capable of scavenging the ROS, establish their virulence and field persistence. SODs are superoxide species scavenging metalloproteins that offer the first line of defense against superoxide damage. The SODs function in cell response, cell differentiation and infection yielded the benefit of mycelial growth, ordered conidiation rhythm, and increased sporulation potential and timely conidial germination in fungi. Fungal SODs are Cu/Zn factored and existent mainly in cytosol or mitochondria (Mn). Mn-SOD has proven to participate in the survival and resistance of aerobic fungi to multiple stresses. A new Mn-SOD has been identified from B. bassiana that offers multifaceted attributes to the entomopathogen, including amplification of the SOD activity by 4\u201310-fold, virulence to Spodoptera litura, and tolerance to chemical oxidation and UV-B irradiation (Xie et al. 2010).",

The constructs were used in conjunction with DBbSOD2/BbSOD2, DBbSOD3/BbSOD3, and wild type. Both the mutant types displayed marked phenotypic alterations, such as delayed sporulation, reduced conidial yield, and impaired conidial quality, but little change in colony morphology. The mycelia and conidia expressed greater sensitivity to menadione- or H2O2-induced oxidative stress but little or no response to hyperosmolarity or elevated temperature, in contrast to the yeast mitochondrial Mn-SOD which protected the yeast cells from osmotic, oxidative, and thermal stress. While disruption of either of the genes resulted in reduced conidial yield and delayed germination, the double-gene-silenced mutants expressed defective sporulation, increased sensitivity to menadione and H2O2, a longer delay in conidial germination, and a decreased virulence, due to a greater loss of the antioxidative capability leading to an increased level of intracellular superoxide species. This fact suggests the additive influence exertion of the two Mn-SODs mediating fungal development, antioxidative capacity, UV resistance, and virulence. However, the increased tolerance of mycelia and conidia of DBbSOD2 to the two oxidants than DBbSOD3 suggested the greater contribution of the mitochondrial BbSOD3 to the fungal antioxidative capability.",

The process of pathogenesis commences with the adhesive interaction between the conidial surface and the insect epicuticle by nonspecific hydrophobic interactions, mediated by the spore-coat hydrophobins. B. bassiana comprises two genes, hyd1 and hyd2, termed as the hydrophobin genes, responsible for cell-surface hydrophobicity, adhesion, virulence, spore thermotolerance, and formation of the rodlet layer, a protective spore-coat structure. Bioinformatic and phylogenetic studies classified both the proteins as class I hydrophobins with no primary sequence homology between them. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of a rodlet layer protein suggested Hyd2 as a spore-coat component. Deactivation of hyd1, i.e., dhyd1, displayed characteristic phenotypic alterations such as apparently \u201cbald\u201d conidia with modified surface fascicles or bundles. The spores were hydrophobic with different surface carbohydrate epitopes and \u03b2-1,3 glucan distribution. Further, their mode of dispersal was sans water, and their virulence was also lowered, but adhesion was not affected. On the contrary, adhesion was lowered in Dhyd2, but the mutants were unaffected in virulence. The double-gene-silenced mutants expressed a lack of bundles and rodlets and a drastically lower surface hydrophobicity, cell attachment, and virulence (Ying and Feng 2004; Zhang et al. 2011).",

The hydrophobin acts as a regulator that senses the environmental conditions, and if found suitable, the spore is allowed to germinate. Thus, at an elevated temperature, hyphal growth would be compromised, and conidial germination inhibition would be adaptive. The above explanation was derived from a distinctly impaired adhesion phenotype in single- and double-gene knockout mutants. Dhyd1 mutant displayed a drastic reduction in virulence when topically assayed against G. mellonella larvae as compared to Dhyd2 mutants though the latter one showed a prominent reduction in adhesion. The intrigue could be explained by the probable clumping of the Dhyd1 conidia resulting in a decreased germination and virulence. In conclusion, hyd1 and hyd2 encode class I hydrophobins that are essential for spore-coat rodlet layer and fascicle formation. Besides, Hyd1 forms the rodlet with Hyd2 acting as an organizing partner (Zhang et al. 2011).",

This attribute is of prime importance where a constant challenge from the various stress factors, such as UV and high temperature, is faced and, particularly in the case of the fungal bioformulation, exposed to the environment. B. bassiana hosts two enzymes, namely, mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase (MPD) for reducing fructose-6-phosphate to mannitol-1-phosphate and mannitol dehydrogenase (MTD) for oxidizing mannitol to fructose. Intracellular mannitol accumulation relates to the increased conidial tolerance to various stresses. This fact was evidenced in single knockout mutants DBbMPD and DBbMTD where a drastic abatement in the mannitol content resulted in a steep decline in conidial tolerance to the various stresses as well as virulence ability as observed against S. litura larvae. Also, mannitol-supplemented nitrate-based minimal medium suppressed the colony growth and conidial germination of DBbMTD at a larger level as compared to DBbMPD (Wang et al. 2012). However, mannitol content decline was supported by trehalose accumulation. Trehalose accumulation is regulated by the enzyme trehalase. Trehalose acts as a carbohydrate store and offers a temporary respite during the stress conditions (Liu et al. 2009). However, owing to its compartmentalization, trehalose cannot replace mannitol to increase conidial thermotolerance. Conclusively, BbMPD and BbMTD represent the flag bearers of mannitol metabolism in B. bassiana contributing to conidial thermotolerance, UV-B resistance, and virulence.",

Fus3/Kss1 MAPK deals with the regulation of infection-related development or process leading to the penetration of host tissues. The Hog1 MAPK is known to be involved in the mediation of virulence and responses against various environmental stresses (osmotic, oxidative, and thermal) and fungicides.

Activation of the gene results in the initiation of vegetative growth and termination in conidiation, while gene repression accelerates conidiation. However, the knockout mutant exhibiting the complete loss of Bbrgs1 gene only reduced conidial production in contrast to other fungi suggesting an alternative mechanism or other RGS proteins in addition to BbRGS1 controlling conidiation in B. bassiana (Fang et al. 2008). Apart from conidiation, Bbrgs1 is actively involved in toxin synthesis, pigment production, stress tolerance, and thermotolerance.

However, hybrid chitinases were developed in which Bbchit1 was fused to chitin-binding domains derived from plant, bacterial, or insect sources. The hybrid chitinase gene was transformed in B. bassiana, and the transformed strains confirmed higher levels of virulence resulting in 23 % less time to kill the targeted insects (Fang et al. 2005).",
