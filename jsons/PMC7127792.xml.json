To understand this fatal respiratory viral infection, several serologic investigations have been conducted (Corman et al., 2016, Min et al., 2016, Park et al., 2015, Payne et al., 2016). However, practical analysis of serodiagnostic parameters for clinical usage was limited in previous studies, due to insufficient sample size or clinical information. We managed 45 MERS-CoV-infected patients, which is the largest number of patients as a single center during the 2015 Korean MERS outbreak (total 186 patients identified) (Cho et al., 2016, Kim et al., 2016, Park et al., 2016), and reported that MERS-CoV-infected patients experienced 4 distinct clinical courses, ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation (Ko et al., 2016). Based on these findings, we evaluated serologic response of 42 MERS-CoV-infected patients according to the disease severity to investigate potential role of serodiagnostic parameters as prognostic markers.",

MERS-CoV infections were confirmed on the basis of real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays targeting upstream of the E gene (upE) and the open-reading frame gene 1a (ORF1a) (Corman et al., 2012a, Madani, 2014). Epidemiologic investigation data and electronic medical records were reviewed to obtain exact exposure date, symptom onset, clinical course, and outcome data for the patients. One or 2 residual serum samples per week of illness were used for serologic testing during hospitalization periods. Follow-up serum samples obtained at outpatient clinics were also tested up to 6 months from symptom onset. The institutional review board of Samsung Medical Center approved the present study.",

For practical purposes, respiratory failure was defined as the need for mechanical ventilation. Only patients in Group 3 experienced fatal outcomes (5/13, 38.5%), and interval from symptom onset to death was 27 days in median (IQR 19\u201335.5). Proportion of underlying immunocompromising conditions including diabetes, solid cancer, or hematologic malignancies was not different between groups (Ko et al., 2016).

In that study, a robust increment of ELISA IgG titer with a 3-fold increase in OD ratio was exclusively observed among patients with severe pneumonia, while mild infections exhibited a modest increment in OD ratio, if any. Likewise, we noted that asymptomatic MERS-CoV-infected cases did not show serologic response including PRNT within 6 months, and the seroconversion rate increased with the disease severity. Although the number of asymptomatic patients was limited to 3 in the present analysis, it is less likely that asymptomatic patients will experience seroconversion considering that even Group 1 patients with obvious MERS-related symptoms showed low seroconversion rate of 60%. This finding correlates with another serologic study that evaluated 11 rRT-PCR-confirmed MERS patients (Choe et al., 2017). In that study, antibody titers in 4 of 6 patients with mild illness were undetectable. In addition, most contact surveys of MERS-CoV could not detect additional rRT-PCR-negative PRNT-positive MERS-CoV infections (Breakwell et al., 2015, Buchholz et al., 2013, Choi et al., 2016, Ko et al., 2017).

Impaired serologic response in deceased patient was also noted in the paper of Corman et al., but insufficient clinical information, especially day of symptom onset, hampered more detailed analysis in association with timeline (Corman et al., 2016). In this study, we could obtain exact clinical information including day of symptom onset, and figured it out that seroconversion status by the third week of illness (by 21 dpoi) can serve as a prognostic marker. Another important point is that MERS-CoV-infected patients in the present analysis died later than previous reports, probably owing to antiviral therapy or aggressive critical care including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The median interval from symptom onset to death was 27 days in the present study, which is much longer than 11.5 days in previous reports (Zumla et al., 2015). Although rapidly deteriorating MERS cases would die before the third week of illness, there certainly is a population that benefit from prognosis prediction by serologic response. Aggressive managements including ECMO should be considered for pneumonia patients without seroconversion by the third week of illness. Although seroconversion status can be confirmed by neutralization tests, it cannot be readily performed worldwide (Corman et al., 2016). In the present analysis, seroconversion status of the third week assessed by ELISA IgG and IgA was similar with that by PRNT. These ELISA tests can be practically used for predicting poor prognosis of MERS pneumonia in the field of patient management.",

However, we applied strict criteria for seroconversion, excluding patients who did not have follow-up samples after the third week of illness as indeterminate response. In the previous report with the same patient population, we also suggest predictive factors for disease progression using clinical variables within 3 days from symptom onset (Ko et al., 2016). Together with the present paper, these factors could be used complementarily in managing MERS-CoV-infected patients. In addition, although we identified that seroconversion status by the third week was associated with fatal outcomes of MERS pneumonia, we could not perform multivariate analysis due to limited sample size. This finding need to be further evaluated with enough patient numbers of MERS pneumonia.",
