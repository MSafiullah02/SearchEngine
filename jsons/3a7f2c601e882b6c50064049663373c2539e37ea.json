However, Fu et al. observed that there was no statistically significant association between fever or shortness of breath and the severity of patients with COVID-19 (2) . To unambiguously identify the risk factors for predicting mortality in patients with COVID-19, we carry out a meta-analysis to evaluate whether fever and dyspnea (not included shortness of breath) were associated with the risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients.",

As presented in sensitivity analysis, none of the individual studies significantly effected the overall OR, which proved the robustness of our results (Figure 1C and 1D). No evidence of publication bias was provided by Begg's test (dyspnea: P = 0.350 and fever: P = 0.964, respectively) and Egger's test (dyspnea: P = 0.294 and fever: P = 0.854, respectively). To our knowledge, the most common clinical symptoms were fever, cough, fatigue and dyspnea in COVID-19 patients (5-7). Zheng et al. demonstrated that the proportion of fever was significantly lower in critical/mortal group compared with the non-critical group (1), which suggests that fever may protect COVID-19 patients from developing to severe and critical disease outcomes. Fu et al. reported that the prevalence of fever in critical group was slightly higher than that in the non-severe group (80.8%, 95% CI [41.1-100.0]) vs. (71.2%, 95% CI [23.8-99.9]), but the difference was not statistically significant (2). Our present study showed that fever was not significantly associated with the risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients. In addition, our study suggested that dyspnea was positively associated with the risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients. Taken together, dyspnea, rather than fever, is recommended as an indicator of poor outcome in COVID-19 patients, further well-designed studies with larger sample sizes are needed to validate the findings of our current study. Contributors LS, YDW, and HYY designed the study. LS and YW screened the literature and extracted the data. LS performed the meta-analysis and wrote the manuscript. HYY, YDW and GCD provided guidance and reviewed the manuscript. All authors have read and agreed the final manuscript.",
