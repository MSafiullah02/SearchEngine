Although a few devices with a similar goal have been described 1,2 , limitations remain, including lack of containment and effective removal of aerosols and the need for sterilization. We developed a negative pressure patient isolation hood that is disposable to reduce sterilization risks, and is coupled to negative pressure generated by smoke evacuators to achieve coronavirus source control during aerosolgenerating procedures (Video 1).",

Most particles generated from human respiratory sources during coughing, sneezing, and talking are droplet nuclei 0.5-5.0 \u03bcm in diameter 3 . A particle counter with a size detection range of 0.3 -10 \u00b5m was placed inside the hood, and a second counter was placed outside of the hood at approximately the height of the clinician's head. With continuous aerosolization, particle counts inside the hood were more than 100-fold greater than that generated by a cough 4 . With the humidifier running continuously, the particle counter at the height of the clinician's head detected 700 [interquartile range 570-800] L -1 aerosolized particles without the protection of a negative-pressure patient isolation hood. In contrast, the particle count was 18 [0-30] L -1 with the hood (Figure 1 ). Particle count from inside the hood decreased by 63% when the smoke evacuator was generating 230 L min -1 of air flow, showing effective aerosol removal.",

Without negative pressure, 183 min was required for the particle count to decrease by 98%, compared to 5 min when negative pressure was applied (eFigure 2). While visual inspection corelated with the removal of large aerosolized particles (greater than 10 \u00b5m), it was highly unreliable at determining degree of removal of small aerosolized particles, as the hood appeared clear when particle count of particles greater than 0.5 \u00b5m was well above 200,000 L -1 .",

Filtered air is then recirculated back to the operating room. The filter has a limited plume evacuation time, thus the need for replacement adds to the cost of using the device.",

It may also reduce the risk of cross contamination between patients in operating rooms. The utility of the hood can be broadened to most situations in which direct patient contact is required, such as transportation, other bedside aerosolgenerating procedures (e.g. tracheostomy, tracheal tube suctioning, open circuit) and during phlebotomy. The negative-pressure patient isolation hood might also enable liberalized use of noninvasive ventilation strategies during the present pandemic in the setting of ventilator shortages. We recommend use of particle counters to study the effectiveness of similar protective devices as most devices have not been properly tested and may therefore provide a false sense of security and put their users at increased risk of exposure to droplets and aerosols.
