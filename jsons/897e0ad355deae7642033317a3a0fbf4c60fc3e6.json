The A-SIR model, i.e. a SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) model with a compartment for infected individuals with no symptoms or few symptoms was proposed by Giuseppe Gaeta, arXiv:2003.08720 [q-bio.PE] (2020). In this paper we investigate a slightly generalized version of the same model and propose a scheme for fitting the parameters of the model to real data using the time series only of the deceased individuals. The scheme is applied to the concrete cases of Lombardy, Italy and S\u00e3o Paulo state, Brazil, showing different aspects of the epidemics. For each case we show that we may have good fits to the data up to the present, but with very large differences in the future behavior. The reasons behind such disparate outcomes are the uncertainty on the value of a key parameter, the probability that an infected individual is fully symptomatic, and on the intensity of the social distancing measures 1 arXiv:2005.11182v1 [q-bio.PE] 22 May 2020 adopted. This conclusion enforces the necessity of trying to determine the real number of infected individuals in a population, symptomatic or asymptomatic.",

These are prone to a large uncertainty, because of the MSA cases, but also underreporting of the symptomatic cases due to the lack of tests. We will use only the data on the number of deaths due to the COVID-19, expected to be more faithful. We will restrict for the time being to the study of the development of COVID-19 in Lombardy and in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. Both cases result in good fits of the model to the data. It will turn out that an important part of the fitting procedure is the way of tuning the value of the infection rate \u03b2 0 to the data.",

Another possibility is that sufficient herd immunity will have been acquired by the populations after the present epidemic and no large increase of cases should happen after relaxation of the social distancing.",

Part of our ignorance is due to the fact that one key parameter of the A-SIR model, the probability that a newly infected individual is symptomatic, is still largely unknown. Another reason for not being able to predict the future of the epidemic is that we do not know how much the social distancing measures adopted were effective in reducing the infection rate of the model. In the case of S\u00e3o Paulo state, Brazil, the fraction of deaths up to now is much smaller than in Lombardy. Although this is good, it also means that the population is still very susceptible. Strong economic pressure is being exerted on politicians for relaxation of the social distancing measures. We predict that even in the best of the possibilities, the number of infected individuals will steadily grow for a large period and in its peak it will be much larger than present values. Thus, social distancing measures should not be relaxed before the number of infected individuals is small. We see that the increase in the number of cases may be catastrophic if social distancing measures are not strengthened.",

In fact, by time t = 40 the fraction of MSA is larger than the number of symptomatic individuals, even considering that the probability of a case being symptomatic is larger than the probability of a MSA case. The reason for obtaining a large number of MSA individuals is not related to \u03be, but to the fact that the mean time \u03b3 \u22121 a that an individual takes as MSA is larger than the mean time \u03b3 \u22121 s taken by a symptomatic individual. To better understand an important issue, in Fig. 2 we plot, for the same set of parameters and initial conditions, the ratio I(t)/(I(t) + A(t)) of symptomatic to total cases. The figure shows that, because of the initial condition I(0) = A(0), the ratio of symptomatic to total infected individuals starts equal to 1/2.

Of course, the exact solution of Eqs. (2) breaks down as an approximation for larger times. This is also shown in Fig. 2 , because I(t) I(t)+A(t) is not always close to the value defined in Eq. (6). Another consequence of Fig. 2 is that the ratio of symptomatic to total infected individuals is a dynamic quantity. It cannot be included as a parameter in the model's equations as in [10] .

The same problem caused by lack of tests is reported also in Brazil and elsewhere. Because of this, we believe that the cumulative number of deaths is a much more faithful indicator of the evolution of the epidemics than the number of confirmed cases, both in Lombardy and in S\u00e3o Paulo. We chose the deaths data in both locations as the sources for our fitting. This approach was also taken e.g. in [5] .

Before entering into details, we describe the fitting procedure in general. Both in Lombardy and in S\u00e3o Paulo state, the epidemic started uncontrolled. Noticing the logarithmic vertical scale, we can see in both panels of Fig. 3 that in the first days the number of deaths seemed to increase exponentially, as expected for the linear regime, see subsection 2.1. We will call these first days as the phase of uncontrolled epidemic. After this phase, in both locations the number of deaths started to increase at a lower rate.

After several experiences we noticed that, as long as \u03bb + is determined and \u03b2 0 is related to it by (4), the results of the model are to large extent independent of \u00b5. This is a consequence of the fact that the initial behavior of the deaths number according to the model is dictated by the linear regime, i.e., \u03bb + , whereas the final behavior is dictated by \u03be, see Eq. phenomenon is illustrated in Fig. 4 , in which the results of A-SIR numerical solutions with two different values of \u00b5 show no noticeable differences. Thus, there will be no problem in adopting for \u00b5 any fixed value. We assume \u00b5 = 0.5 for the rest of this paper. The goodness of a fit between the number of deaths reported in the data and the A-SIR model will be quantified by a cost function to be minimized.

The cost function also depends on the initial conditions to be used in the numerical solution of the model's differential equations. The initial conditions will be specified when needed. The value of d depends on which data is used for estimating the parameters. For example, for estimating \u03bb + and \u03c9 we will take d to be the last day of the uncontrolled epidemic phase. For estimating the intensity of social distancing measures, we will use a large value for d. Of course neither the square root, nor the multiplication by N/d are necessary in the definition of the cost function, but they are included for convenience.

In the large white area the cost fuction has larger values than in the colored area. It seems clear that the function has a global minimum in the darker area. The numerically determined location of the minimum point is \u03bb + = 0.302, \u03c9 = 0.074. Contour plot of c 43 as a function of 1 and \u03be. The remaining parameters are \u03b3 s = 1/7, \u03b3 a = 1/21 (fixed), \u00b5 = 0.5 (arbitrary) and \u03bb + = 0.302, \u03c9 = 0.074 (determined by minimizing c 6 ). Darker colors are smaller values and lighter colors are higher values of the cost function. The blue canyon shaped region is where c 43 is close to its minimum. Plots of expected outcomes for the COVID-19 epidemic in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo for up to 150 days after Mar. 17. The blue dots compare the results with epidemic deaths data. The optimistic and pessimistic outcomes are presented in the first and second row, respectively. The plots in the different columns are different only in the range of the vertical scale. The parameter values valid for both rows are: \u03b3 s = 1/7, \u03b3 a = 1/21, \u03bb + = 0.302, \u03c9 = 0.074, \u00b5 = 0.5. For the first row only, 1 = 0.395, \u03be = 0.02 and the social isolation measures were relaxed at day 100. For the second row only, both optimistic and pessimistic cases the fraction of susceptible individuals remains for a long period above the threshold in the right-hand side of Eq. (8).",
