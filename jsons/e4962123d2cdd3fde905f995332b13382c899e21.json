By Feb 10, 2020, more than 40,000 people had been infected. There are currently no specific treatments for COVID-19 infection. Supportive treatment combined with existing antiviral agents are the mainstay treatments. More than 1,000 people have lost their lives in the past 2 months. Mortality are as high as 15% in critically ill patients requiring intensive care unit admission and oxygen therapy [1] , suggesting an urgent need to try therapeutic interventions in addition to supportive treatment. We report here a case of a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patient who failed to respond to conventional therapeutic interventions and developed respiratory failure and shock accompanied by persistent diarrhoea. The patient avoided mechanical ventilation and acquired an immediate clinical and radiological improvement, after treatment of intensive plasma exchange (PE) followed by intravenous immunogloblin (IVIG).",

In the current case, the patient failed to respond to conventional interventions and progressed to persistent diarrhea, acute respiratory failure and shock. Undoubtedly, she belongs to severe type of COVID-19. The timely initiating PE treatment followed by IVIG protected the patient from progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure. Miraculously, the patient made a prompt recovery, without mechanical ventilation and intensive supportive care, after PE treatment. The successful experience in our case suggests that timely treatment with PE followed by IVIG is worth trying, especially in those critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection, since it may significantly improve the prognosis.

            "text": "The mechanisms accounting for the immediate improvement of the patient remains to be illustrated. It is most likely that timely treatment with PE followed by IVIG contributed to the prompt recovery of the patient with a favourable prognosis. It has been well documented that the \"cytokine storm\" may involve in the disease progression of COVID-19 infection in critically ill patients. A previous study reported that COVID-19 patients requiring ICU admission have significantly higher plasma levels of cytokines and chemokines [1] , suggesting the immune system is activated and cytokine storm is formed. In the current case, PE followed by IVIG was initiated when signs of the cytokine storm appeared (that is, decreased oxygenation index, progressively declined lymphocyte count, serum enzymes and creatine levels began to increase, shock, high levels of CRP). The patient presented an immediate clinical and laboratory improvement after initiating PE treatment followed by IVIG. Her lymphocyte count recovered gradually, after intensive treatment of PE. Pathogenic substances, cytokines, as well as inflammatory mediators might be cleared by PE and then the subsequent supplementation of immunoglobulin exerted its immunoregulatory and antiviral effects. This perfect combination treatment produced satisfactory effect. Our speculation is supported by previous studies which demonstrated that PE could decrease serum cytokines, as well as blood viral loads in patients with certain viral infections [3, 4] . Cytokine storm is also believed to be the center of pathophysiology of fatal influenza virus infection. The recovery of three critically ill patients with ARDS and severe shock due to 2009 pH1N1 influenza A virus infection after PE treatment [4] suggests that PE is still effective even in the later stages of cytokine storms. Application of IVIG is associated with decreased loads of viral and improved prognosis during 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza and SARS, which is also caused by a coronavirus [5, 6] . Unfortunately, we did not evaluate viral loads and cytokine levels before and after plasma exchange. Other mechanisms such as the wide spectrum antibacterial and antiviral specificities of IVIG, as well as the immunomodulatory effects of IVIG [7] should be considered in explaining the resolution of clinical signs in this case.",
