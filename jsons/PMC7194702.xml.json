However, we are still facing many regional barriers such as: lack of massive testing for patients, either asymptomatic or symptomatic, disparities between the number of COVID-19 patients interned in public intensive care units (ICUs) versus private ICUs (and also number of available ICUs throughout the country), possible undernotification of a central national data for several reasons and most importantly, not all facilities have sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE).",

Testing should be massively encouraged prior to surgery. Within the operating room, N-95 masks should be guaranteed for the surgical team (as well as the rest of accessories \u2013 shoe covers, gown, protective head covering, gloves and eye protection), number of personnel should be restricted inside the operating room (OR), and prior conversation with the anesthesia team should be done prior to each procedure.",
