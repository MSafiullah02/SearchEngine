IBV is a member of the genus Gammacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae and is an important viral pathogen in the poultry industry. It causes a highly contagious disease in chickens, mainly affecting the respiratory and reproductive tract [1]. The mechanisms involved in IBV pathogenesis and the host\u2019s response are still not fully understood. The pathogenicity of the virus has been linked to the activation of apoptosis, the inhibition of innate antiviral immunity, and the induction of proinflammatory cytokine production [2, 3]. However, the specific factors facilitating these processes, and the way IBV influences them for the benefit of either the virus or the host remain to be identified.",

They are implicated in numerous cellular processes, including viral infections. Several members of the family Coronaviridae have been shown to modulate the host miRNA repertoire, thereby influencing viral pathogenesis [4\u20139]. Coronavirus-induced miRNAs have been suggested to modulate the host\u2019s antiviral immune responses including viral sensing [5], cytokine secretion [4, 7\u20139], and T-cell-mediated cell killing [7]. For IBV, the production of a number of miRNAs have been described to be influenced in chicken kidneys upon infection with IBV strains with different nephropathogenicity [10]. Little is known, however, about the overall effects of IBV infection on the miRNA repertoire influencing the (antiviral) immune response in particular.",

Therefore, these were left out of any further analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was performed to determine the biological processes in which the genes are involved, revealing that 13 immune-related GO terms were significantly enriched (p < 0.05) in the spleen, and six in the lungs. For the spleen, functional terms included positive regulation of B-cell development, induction of cytokine production, suppression of T-cell development, and positive regulation of viral transcription by the host. In the lungs, the functional terms were induction of cytokine production, B-cell proliferation, and regulation of the MAPK cascade.",

Successful IBV infection was confirmed in all M41-infected embryos by measuring viral RNA in the lungs (Cq \u2264 30). We selected three gene targets of DE miRNAs both in the spleens and in the lungs for which downregulation is predicted to negatively affect immune activities (NFATC3, NFAT5 and SPPL3). Moreover, we included two genes targeted by DE miRNAs only in the spleen (TGFB2 and JUN) for which downregulation would presumably result in immune activation. Figure 3 shows the normalized relative expression of the genes, demonstrating gene downregulation in the spleens (Fig. 3A) upon M41 infection for all genes except JUN. The RT-qPCR analysis of the lungs revealed that M41 infection does not influence the expression of any of the analyzed genes in this organ (Fig. 3B).",

In contrast, in the lungs, none of the predicted target genes were affected, despite the presence of viral RNA. Theoretically, immune-related genes should be affected to a larger extent in organs with an important immune function. Furthermore, the number of affected miRNAs and miRNA clusters was higher in the spleen than in the lungs (17 versus five DE miRNAs, and four versus one cluster), suggesting that widespread host miRNA modulation occurs in the spleen. However, an effect in the lungs at a different time point cannot be ruled out. As primary immune responses against virus infections often take days to fully develop, especially adaptive antiviral immune responses including lymphocyte expansion and activation, it could be worthwhile to examine the modulation of immune-related target genes at later time points. Finally, mRNA targets might be translationally repressed in the lungs without inducing degradation, but this was not further investigated.",

A wide range of miRNAs, including miR-34c, -34b, -1b, -1a, -206, and -499, have been linked to influenza virus infection in chickens, and most of these miRNAs have been associated with immune-related functions (miR-34c, -34b, -1b, -1a, and -206).

Perhaps these miRNAs represent a general chicken host response to infection with virulent IBV. Notably, some upregulated miRNAs in our screening were found to be downregulated in their screening, namely gga\u2212miR\u2212203a, \u2212200a, and \u2212429. These miRNAs may have opposing roles in virus-host interactions depending on the viral strain or organ. Interestingly, miRNAs such as gga-miR-203a and -200a target genes with suspected pro-viral functions, such as TGFB2, a gene involved in T-cell suppression, which might result in stimulation of antiviral T-cell functions. Gga-miR-429-3p may inhibit viral replication by targeting JUN, which normally stimulates viral transcription by the host.
