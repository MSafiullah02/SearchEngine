Despite modern prevention and treatment strategies, they remain a common opportunistic pathogen associated with serious morbidity and mortality, particularly in immunocompromised individuals such as transplant recipients1 and AIDS patients.2, 3 All drugs currently licensed for the treatment of HCMV and VZV infections (Fig. 1\n) target the viral DNA polymerase. Unfortunately they are associated with severe toxicity issues, including marrow toxicity for ganciclovir, valganciclovir, and cidofovir, and renal toxicity for foscarnet and cidofovir.4, 5 The emergence of drug resistance is also a significant problem.6 Moreover, our understanding of the full spectrum of risks of HCMV infection and its interactions with the host immune system remains far from complete.7 While the past two decades have seen progress toward novel treatments for herpesviruses, the need for better drugs that exhibit an improved toxicity profile persists.8\n",

Based on the successful synthesis of several previously reported compounds,9 a series of analogs were synthesized following the classical synthetic approach reported in Scheme 1\n.

Since thymidine kinase is required for the activation of nucleoside analogs (e.g., acyclovir and brivudin), it is likely these compounds are acting as nonnucleoside inhibitors.24 Other substituents at R1 were found inactive (7a, 7c\u2013e). As was noted for the HCMV inhibition, elongation of the spacer has a pronounced positive impact on the anti-VZV properties. Compound 7i featuring 8 methylene units proved the most active, with EC50\u2019s of \u2a7e 0.12 \u03bcM and \u2a7e 0.16 \u03bcM for the OKA and 07-1 strains, respectively.

The antiviral assays were based on inhibition of virus-induced cytopathicity or plaque formation in human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblasts, African green monkey cells (Vero), human epithelial cells (HeLa) or Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK). Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID50 of virus (1 CCID50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or 10 or 100 plaque forming units (PFU) (for VZV and HCMV) in the presence of varying concentrations of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity or plaque formation was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC50 or compound concentration required to reduce virus-induced cytopathogenicity or viral plaque formation by 50%.",

The cytostatic concentration was calculated as the CC50, or the compound concentration required reducing cell proliferation by 50% relative to the number of cells in the untreated controls. CC50 values were estimated from graphic plots of the number of cells (percentage of control) as a function of the concentration of the test compounds. Alternatively, cytotoxicity of the test compounds was expressed as the minimum cytotoxic concentration (MCC) or the compound concentration that caused a microscopically detectable alteration of cell morphology.
