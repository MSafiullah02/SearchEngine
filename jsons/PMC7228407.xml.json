However, it seems to be confirmed that diabetes predisposes to certain types of infection and death,6, 7, 8, 9, 11 but it is still unknown whether diabetes is a risk factor for the prognosis of COVID\u201019. Type 2 diabetes is widely viewed as a chronic, low\u2010grade inflammatory disease caused by long\u2010term immune system imbalance, metabolic syndrome or nutrient excess associated with obesity.14, 15 Obesity\u2010associated inflammation is characterized by an increased abundance and activation of innate and adaptive immunity cells in adipose tissue along with an increased release of inflammatory factors and chemokines locally and systemically.\n16\n On the other side, data from human and animal studies suggest that some viruses are diabetogenic.\n17\n Jali et al\n18\n reported two individuals presenting with acute insulin dependent diabetes mellitus for a brief and transient period after being infected with chicken pox. And in a study of SARS, Yang et al\n11\n found that even in non\u2010severe patients who have not been treated with glucocorticoid drugs, their fasting blood glucose levels are higher. Another study found that the immunostaining of ACE2 protein is strong in islets, but weak in exocrine tissues which means coronavirus might cause diabetes by damaging islets seriously.\n19\n Since viral infection may cause sharp fluctuation of blood glucose level of diabetes patients, which adversely affect the recovery of patients, there is a reason to suspect that diabetes combined with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 pneumonia may form a vicious circle, which is detrimental to the prognosis of COVID\u201019.",

In our study, we found that, compared to patients without diabetes, absolute count of lymphocytes in peripheral blood of patients with diabetes is significantly lower, while the absolute count of neutrophils is remarkably higher. Furthermore, the serum levels of some inflammation\u2010related biomarker are much higher compared to those without diabetes, such as IL\u20106, serum ferritin, ESR and CRP. It's noteworthy that for diseases that can induce a cytokine storm. IL\u20106 is a very good predictor of disease severity and prognosis, and its expression time is longer than other cytokines (TNF and IL\u20101).\n21\n In addition, a significant rise in serum ferritin indicates the activation of the monocyte\u2010macrophage system, which is a crucial part of inflammatory storm.
