We need to, however, contribute more to the diagnostic trail. Lung infections caused by organisms other than Mycobacterium tuberculosis, are, nevertheless, a major cause of morbidity and mortality. In recent times, there has been an alarming increase in drug resistance strains. Recent data from the Indian intensive care unit (ICU) setting shows that most of the pathogens are resistant to common antibiotics.[1] Empirical broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy is one of the causes responsible for this. Unusual infections are encountered more frequently now because of increased survival in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients, incidence of organ transplants, and emergence of newer viruses with atypical imaging features. Radiologists need to be more aware about the dominant imaging patterns in different types of these infections and the \u201cred flag\u201d imaging signs which make a difference to the management.",

A consensus guideline document was issued by these two societies in 2007.[2] Among its various recommendations was the development of locally adapted guidelines. Accordingly, Indian Chest Society and National College of Chest Physicians (India) developed national pneumonia guidelines.[3] As per the IDSA/ATS guidelines, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is defined as \u201can acute infection of the pulmonary parenchyma that is associated with at least some symptom of acute infection, accompanied by the presence of an acute infiltrate on a chest radiograph or auscultatory findings consistent with pneumonia, in a patient not hospitalized or residing in a long-term care facility for more than 14 days before the onset of symptoms.[2] The definition itself includes confirmation by chest radiograph (moderate recommendation, level III evidence). The role of the radiologist is, therefore, to confirm the presence of lung infiltrate and its severity. In simple cases, if the clinical improvement upon treatment is satisfactory, then a follow-up radiograph is not recommended (Strong recommendation, level II evidence).[3] Computed tomography (CT) scan is not routinely indicated in the diagnosis of CAP (strong recommendation, level II evidence).[3]",

            "text": "Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is defined as pneumonia occurring \u226548 hours after admission not incubating at the time of admission. Related terms are ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP) and healthcare associated pneumonia (HCAP). VAP refers to pneumonia that arises after more than 48 hours of endotracheal intubation. As per the IDSA/ATS consensus statement, HCAP includes any patient who was hospitalized in an acute care hospital for 2 or more days within 90 days of the infection; resided in a nursing home or long-term care facility within the past 30 days of the current infection. HCAP is included in the spectrum of HAP and VAP, and patients with HCAP need therapy for MDR pathogens.[24] In the Indian scenario, similar long-term health care facilities are uncommon and the term HCAP is avoided in the ICS/NCCP (I) guidelines.[3] The diagnosis of HAP/VAP is made by the presence of signs and symptoms to acute infection with appearance of new or progressive infiltrate on the chest radiograph or by positive culture samples. It can be divided into early or late HAP/VAP depending upon whether the pneumonia occurs within or after 4 days of admission/mechanical ventilation, respectively.[2] CT is not routinely indicated in the routine diagnosis of HAP/VAP (strong recommendation, level III evidence).[3]",

More virulent pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Gram negative bacilli (GNB) can be found in addition to the routine organisms in CAP patients requiring ICU care.[5] However, in India, it is not uncommon to find Methicillin-Resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Drug Resistant S. pneumoniae (DRSP) in CAP isolates.[6] In late onset (>4 days) HAP, aerobic GNB and S. aureus are more common. Anaerobes, Legionella, Pneumocystis, tuberculosis, viruses, and fungi are uncommon causes and occur irrespective of the timing of acquiring HAP.",

Staphylococcal pneumonia can commonly lead to complications such as lung abscess and empyema. It is important to differentiate the two because empyema requires drainage whereas medical therapy is curative for most lung abscesses.[79] Empyema typically forms an obtuse angle with the lung parenchyma and shows \u201csplit pleura sign\u201d on CECT due to enhancement of visceral and parietal pleura [Figure 4A]. Lung abscess forms acute angle with lung parenchyma and bronchovascular structures end on the wall of abscess rather than being splayed [Figure 4B]. In the healing phase, pneumatoceles can be seen as thin-walled air filled lung cysts [Figure 4C], which can rupture to cause pneumothorax. Pneumatoceles are not specific for S. aureus because they can occasionally be seen in Escherichia coli, S. pneumonia, and Pneumocystis jiroveci infection. A variant strain of S. aureus named Panton Valentine Leukocidin toxin positive (PVL+ve) was discovered in 2002 and is more common in children than adults. There is a history of rapid deterioration of flu-like illness caused by alveolar hemorrhage and extensive necrotizing pneumonia [Figure 5].[710]",

Septal thickening is a predominant feature in measles, Hantavirus, and SARS, but is not a typical feature of other more common viruses. Bronchial or bronchiolar wall thickening is common in RSV, measles, and adenovirus but not common in others.
