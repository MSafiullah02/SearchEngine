Due to global limitations in testing capacity, effective prioritization of individuals for testing is essential. Here, we devised a model that estimates the probability of an individual to test positive for COVID-19 based on answers to 9 simple questions regarding age, gender, presence of prior medical conditions, general feeling, and the symptoms fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat and loss of taste or smell, all of which have been associated with COVID-19 infection. Our model was devised from a subsample of a national symptom survey that was answered over 2 million times in Israel over the past 2 months and a targeted survey distributed to all residents of several cities in Israel. Overall, 43,752 adults were included, from which 498 self-reported as being COVID-19 positive. The model provides statistically significant predictions on held-out individuals and achieves a positive predictive value (PPV) of 46.3% at a 10% sensitivity. As our tool can be used online and without the need of exposure to suspected patients, it may have worldwide utility in combating COVID-19 by better directing the limited testing resources through prioritization of individuals for testing, thereby increasing the rate at which positive individuals can be identified and isolated.",

While the current gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis is detection of viral RNA in a reverse transcription PCR test, the number of tests is limited by financial and logistic constraints. In a time when almost all countries are faced with the same health challenge, resources are scarce. This creates the need for a prioritization mechanism to allocate tests and resources more efficiently towards individuals who are more likely to test positive, leading to earlier identification of COVID-19 patients and reduced spread of the virus. Despite this need, most countries still employ a simplistic testing strategy based on display of symptoms associated with the disease and either close epidemiological contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case or belonging to a high risk group 3 . In practice, these strategies lead to a relatively small fraction of positive tests among those tested and thus to inefficient use of the precious testing resources.",

Notably, while most studies describing the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 cases were based on symptoms of hospitalized patients 4 , our survey data allowed us to also study symptoms of milder cases and reveal which symptoms hold the highest predictive power for COVID-19 diagnosis. Using our model, the risk for a positive COVID-19 test can be evaluated in less than a minute and without added costs, or risk of exposure to a suspected patient. Our approach can thus be used globally to make more efficient use of available testing capacities, by significantly increasing the fraction of positive tests obtained, and by rapidly identifying individuals that should be isolated until definitive test results are obtained.",

The online version of the survey includes questions relating to age, gender, prior medical conditions, smoking habits, self-reported symptoms and geographical location (see section 1a in the supplementary appendix). Questions regarding prior medical conditions and symptoms included in the survey were carefully chosen by medical professionals. Each participant is asked to fill the survey once a day for himself and for family members that are unable to fill it for themselves (e.g. children and the elderly). The survey is anonymous to maintain the privacy of the participants, and has been collected since March 14th, 2020. As the number of COVID-19 diagnosed individuals in Israel rose, in some cities more than others, a shortened version of the survey was deployed using an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) platform. This version of the survey included information on respondents' age group, gender, presence of prior medical conditions, general feeling and a partial list of symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat and loss of taste or smell (see Section 1b in the supplementary appendix). Cities were targeted to participate in the IVR version of the survey according to the number of diagnosed patients and an increased concern for COVID-19 outbreaks (Table S1) . Starting April 5, 2020, citizens in the targeted cities were contacted and responses were collected anonymously. This study followed the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) reporting guideline 6 .",

By taking an unbiased approach to predicting COVID-19 diagnosis from symptoms data, our analysis highlights the importance of additional symptoms. Of note, anosmia and ageusia that were less described in patients in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic 4,12 were the most impactful features in both models for predicting COVID-19 diagnosis as well as in an odds-ratio analysis. This is in line with recent literature demonstrating the importance of these symptoms in early detection and identification of the disease 13, 14, 15 . Our model also successfully recapitulated patterns of the disease that are described in the literature, such as its complex relationship with age 11 . In addition, our model unraveled several patterns that are not described in the literature, such as the different patterns of interactions that particular symptoms have with age, suggesting variation of the clinical manifestation in different age groups. Although our analysis is purely predictive and not causal, these new patterns may be used to devise better testing policies, and pave the way for future studies that can uncover new aspects of the disease that were not studied to date.",

To better understand which features contribute to the probability of being diagnosed with COVID-19, and to examine feature interactions, we analyzed the primary model constructed using the Gradient Boosting Decision Trees algorithm (see Methods). This model showed similar performance to the Logistic Regression model (Figure 2D-F, Table S3), with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 52.6%, at 10% sensitivity, while the baseline model only has 0.025%, at 10% sensitivity.
