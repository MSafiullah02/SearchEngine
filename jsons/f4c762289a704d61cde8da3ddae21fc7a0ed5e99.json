            "text": "Gail Hopkins, PsyD, a 39-year-old Black psychologist, wakes up feeling anxious and falls asleep feeling anxious about the COVID-19 pandemic. In between, she experiences diffuse background worry most of the day. As a member of the sandwich generation, Dr. Hopkins worries about both her two young children quarantined at home and her aging parents with serious health problems. She juggles her half-time responsibilities at the local psychiatric hospital, where she continues to see patients in person, with her half-time position in a group private practice, where she sees all patients seamlessly via telepsychology. Financial concerns constitute part of her daily worries. Since repaying her student loans last year, she was prepared to transition to full-time independent practice this year and purchase a larger home, but the pandemic has stymied those plans. Her husband has been furloughed from his job for at least two months, and she cannot afford to leave the hospital, which provides health insurance for the family. She risks being overwhelmed by the surge of patients, by the juggling of restless home-bound children and ailing parents, and by her own anxiety, which is heightened by the knowledge that the African-American community has been differentially affected by Samuel Jones, PhD, a 69-year-old White psychologist, wakes up in the morning feeling uncertain and despondent about his practice, his kids, and his future. Before the pandemic, he successfully ran his solo private practice with a steady stream of patients and a plan to retire next year. But now, his retirement funds are down by 25% and his patients at least that much as he struggles to transition to telepsychology. He rarely used his laptop except for occasional emails and to check the news, but like many of his contemporaries, Dr. Jones was forced to adopt a HIPAA-compliant platform for telepsychology on only a week's notice. It's operational now, but not without lingering concerns for patient privacy, insurance reimbursement, and ethical standards. His two grown children prey on his mind as well: one lost her job to the pandemic in the gig economy, and the other lives in New York City, an epicenter of the virus. Dr. Jones is understandably stressed, confused, and angry.",
