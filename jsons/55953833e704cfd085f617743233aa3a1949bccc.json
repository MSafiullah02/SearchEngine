Bioinformatics software has been an effective tool to study the HCV genome as well as core domains. Our research was based on employing several bioinformatics software applications to find important mutations in domain 1 of core protein in Iranian HCV infected samples from 2006 to 2017, and an investigation of general properties, B-cell and T-cell epitopes, modification sites, and structure of domain 1. Domain 1 sequences of 188 HCV samples isolated from 2006 to 2017, Iran, were retrieved from NCBI gene bank. Using several tools, all sequences were analyzed for determination of mutations, physicochemical analysis, B-cell epitopes prediction, T-cell and CTL epitopes prediction, post modification, secondary and tertiary structure prediction. Our analysis determined several mutations in some special positions (70, 90, 91, and 110) that are associated with HCC and hepatocarcinogenesis, efficacy of triple therapy and sustained virological response, and interaction between core and CCR6. Several B-cell, T-cell, and CTL epitopes were recognized. Secondary and tertiary structures were mapped fordomain1 and core proteins. Our study, as a first report, offered inclusive data about frequent mutation in HCV-core gene domain 1 in Iranian sequences that can provide helpful analysis on structure and function of domain 1 of the core gene.",

Green lines indicate 6 sites for serine, blues lines show 3 sites for threonine, and one purple line shows tyrosine. All sites with scores above the threshold of 0.5 were considered as phosphorylation sites reliable. Final structures (Figs. 6, 7) were validated by Qmean. QMEANscore and Z-score for calculated for core were 0.242 and \u2212 5.43. The scores were not satisfactory but at least provided an overview of the core protein structure. QMEANscore and Z-score for domain 1 were 0.61 and \u2212 1.24 confirming the quality and reliability of the predicted structure. Ramachandran plot was assessed by RAMPAGE, and percentages of the favoured region, allowed region, and outlier region for core were 63.0%, 27.5%, and 9.5% respectively . 3 Secondary structure prediction using SOMPA. Red region is extended strand, blue is the alpha helix, green is beta turn, and purple is the random coil. The majority of core structure belongs to random coil Fig. 4 Secondary structure prediction using PHYRE2. The result of this tool shows that the majority of the core structure (40%) is alpha helix which is indicated with green helix, also the confidence keys of the predicted structure for these regions are high (Fig. 8) . RAMPAGE results for domain1 showed 61.7% of residues in favored region and 24.3 in allowed region (Fig. 9 ). Figure 10 showed the showed T cell and B-cell epitopes on the surface of the core protein.",

Amino acid 116 is a serine that located in Arg-Arg-Arg-Ser-Arg region; this region was similar to the usual target sequence for protein kinase A [Arg-Arg-X-Ser/Thr-X]. Two threonine amino acid residues (15, 49) were calculated as protein kinase c target sites where this kinase acts through the phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of amino acid residue. Previous studies indicated that core protein is phosphorylated by PKA and PKC.",
