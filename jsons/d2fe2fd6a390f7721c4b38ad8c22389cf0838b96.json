Influenza affects 5%-15% of the population and causes 250,000 to 500,000 deaths annually worldwide [6] . The cost of one influenzalike (ILI) case, which includes the costs of medical care and days lost due to ILI, represents approximately about 20% of the monthly per capita income in southern China [2] . By contrast, studies on the recent aetiology and circulation of multiple respiratory illnesses circulating concurrently amongst the population in regions of China are limited [7] . Detected by the ILI surveillance system, the common viruses that cause respiratory illness symptoms in Hong Kong and other regions include, but are not limited to, influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), adenovirus, enterovirus and rhinovirus [8, 9] .",

For example, the timely and accurate observation of the epidemiology of other respiratory viruses may assist with predicting the timing and size of influenza epidemic and adopt opportune preventative measures [13] . Multiple delays in the influenza pandemic in European countries have attracted attention; these delays are presumably linked to epidemics of other respiratory infections [10, 14] . To gain more insight into the interaction between different respiratory viruses and their subtypes, this study investigated the interference amongst seasonal epidemics of six major respiratory illnesses in Hong Kong from 2014 to 2017 based on laboratory surveillance data.",

ILI was defined as a fever \u226538\u00b0C and cough or sore throat [17] . Weekly consultation rates of patients with influenza-like illnesses were reported by General Practitioners (GPs, 50 reporting clinics) and Out-patient Clinics (GOPCs, 64 reporting clinics) spread over Hong Kong, amongst which approximately 24% of total outpatient consultations are held by GOPC and 57% by GP [18] . Respiratory specimens in laboratory surveillance were collected from ILI patients in GOPC and GP and predominately from inpatients with acute respiratory diseases [17, 19] . Consequently, a bias for severe cases exists but the seasonality, particularly the peak and trough periods of the virus infection, remain almost unchanged due to this bias. Since February 2014, molecular testing for specimens has replaced viral culture in Hong Kong [20] . Although asymptomatic viral infections can be missed by the surveillance system, the laboratory surveillance reports the weekly numbers of specimens that were confirmed positive for various viruses (only specimens collected prior to antiviral therapy were counted) and is acknowledged to represent the local situation of respiratory virus activities in Hong Kong. We investigated the seasonal trend of viruses from laboratory surveillance reporting in Hong Kong from 2014 to 2017: i) Influenza virus subtypes A and B; ii) Parainfluenza virus (PIV) subtypes I, II, III and IV; iii) Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); iv) Adenovirus; v) Rhinovirus; vi) Enterovirus.",

Confidence intervals were obtained from the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of the bootstrap distribution of the seasonal coefficients. The annual peak timing, semiannual peak timing and confidence intervals on the peak timing estimates of six common respiratory viruses were calculated in this procedure separately.",

The most laboratory reports were available for influenza A and the least for enterovirus (41,787 and 2875 infections during the entire study period, respectively, Table 1 ). The time series of weekly laboratoryconfirmed positive rates of all considered viruses and the total numbers of the tested specimens are shown in Fig. 1 . To facilitate the demonstration of low and high peaks of different viruses in the graph, high peaks of influenza were scaled down (the portion greater than 0.1 was shrunk to 1/3 of the original value, changing the height but not the shape of the epidemic during the period). The weekly total numbers of respiratory samples were cyclical within a year. From January through March, the total numbers of respiratory samples increased to the peak value. A decrease occurred until June, when a small rebound appeared that was lower than the spring peak.",

Current multi-regional surveillance data on non-influenza respiratory viruses remain limited, particularly in China and other developing countries. Laboratory surveillance data in Hong Kong from 2014 to 2017 reported that the main pathogenic viruses of acute respiratory infections in this area are influenza viruses. In addition, PIV, RSV, adenovirus and rhinovirus are important components that cause acute respiratory infections. Although enterovirus is often found in the respiratory secretions and stool of an infected person [26, 27] , pharynx swab specimens are useful for capturing the seasonality of enterovirus in our study. An enhanced epidemiological surveillance system considering a catch-all approach is more affordable than a single pathogen path, particularly by using residual samples from existing influenza surveillance [3] . To our knowledge, our study is one of the latest studies that focuses on local viral interference in a subtropical city in Asia and contributes new evidence to support the construction of a multi-virus surveillance system. Seasonal features of the influenza viruses, PIV, enterovirus and adenovirus have been supported by multiyear laboratory-confirmed surveillance data. The influenza viruses usually erupted in February and July, and the summer peaks in July were generally caused by the H3 subtype of influenza A alone. Between the spring and summer peaks of influenza, a rising trend of virus activity contributed by PIV, adenovirus and enterovirus can be observed. After the summer peak of influenza, a PIV epidemic often occurred in November. It is necessary to explore the seasonal epidemics together with mutual interference of influenza and other respiratory viruses. Because seasonality reflects oscillatory changes in infectiousness, which includes contact patterns, pathogen survival, or host susceptibility [28] , the correct identification of seasonality can help predict and monitor the epidemic trends of many viruses.",

When the summer peak of influenza was delayed in 2016, a rise of infections from the other five viruses was observed, indicating an interplay of respiratory virus epidemics. Although the reasons behind this delay were unclear, it can be explained by a potential general anti-influenza virus immunity in the population, triggered by the epidemic in February of 2015. Several immunology studies have confirmed the virus-virus interaction: infections with similar viruses can start producing interferon and other cytokines with similar structures in cells and induce resistance to possible infections by similar viruses [31] .",

This occurred presumably because the previous epidemic caused the population to produce a specific antibody to the adenovirus, which led to a significant reduction in the positive rate of adenovirus in the next epidemic season.

The prevalence of rhinovirus may have affected the subsequent flu summer peaks and even inhibited the influenza epidemic. The recent multiple delays of influenza epidemics in European countries had also drawn the attention of researchers to the problem. In Switzerland and some European countries in 2009, swine influenza began to spread after the holidays. Four weeks later, the intensity suddenly declined despite no significant changes of climate and social behavior. The population's immunity is likely to increase due to infection, but that is unlikely the entire reason, and there were extremely few cases of ILI during the period [10] . Meanwhile, the weekly laboratory-confirmed positive rates of rhinovirus increased significantly. Some retrospective studies have found evidence that rhinovirus infection can reduce adenovirus, PIV and influenza A virus infections [32, 33] . By contrast, although the influenza A epidemic could delay the RSV epidemic and prevent the influenza B virus from occurring at all, it had little effect on the rhinovirus [12] . The mechanism was as follows: once a rhinovirus infection developed, the infected cells began producing interferon and other cytokines, which were similar to those generated by influenza-infected cells [10] . Because the symptoms of rhinovirus infection are often mild or asymptomatic [9] , some researchers have suggested that increasing the infection rate of rhinovirus within a certain range may potentially leave the population at a lower risk of influenza epidemics [32] .",
