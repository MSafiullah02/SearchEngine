Second, he was a former smoker with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and it has been shown that this clinical condition is an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 [4]. Third, as a strong inflammatory response can be elicited during immune checkpoint treatment, immunotherapy may increase the risk of COVID-19 with a poorer prognosis [5].",

Several factors have been hypothesized to be responsible for the high rate of falsely negative swabs, that represents a serious problem when it comes to defining the extent and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. A factor is the different quality, sensitivity and specificity of the kits used for the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), that is the standard method to detect SARS-CoV-2. Inappropriate collection, transportation and handling of samples may also affect the results of the test. Mutations in the primer and probe target regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome can compromise the assay performance in the detection of the virus. Moreover, the false negativity may depend on the considered sample type [6]. A retrospective analysis of specimens from multiple sites taken from 205 patients has found that nasal swabs have a lower positivity rate (63%) than bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (93%) [7], and it is likely that tests of multiple sites would reduce the number of falsely negative patients.",
