            "text": "\nStreptococcus pneumoniae, nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common causative bacteria for AOM as well as OME. Because those pathogens ascend into the middle ear from the nasopharynx through the eustachian tube, nasopharyngeal colonization with those bacteria is considered the prerequisite for OM. In fact, most of the pathogens cultured from MEEs are identical to those found in the nasopharynx (Kurono et al., 1988). The carriage rate of NTHi in the nasopharynx is higher in patients with OME than in healthy children, and the intensity of the colonization is associated with the occurrence of this disease. Ueyama et al. (1995) investigated the presence P6 gene DNA of H. influenzae in nasopharyngeal secretions by PCR and demonstrated that the incidence was significantly higher in patients with OME than that in controls. They also reported that P6 gene DNA was detected in all nasopharyngeal secretions of patients with OME who had P6 gene DNA in MEEs. Those findings suggest that microorganisms in the nasopharynx, as well as those in the middle ear, play an important role in the pathogenesis of OM. Further, Rayner et al. (1998) demonstrated the presence of bacterial mRNA in MEEs by an RT-PCR-based assay. Because bacterial mRNA has a half-life measured in seconds to minutes, detection of bacteria-specific mRNA would be evidence that metabolically active organisms are present. The results showed that all specimens having DNA of H. influenzae detected by PCR but negative by conventional culture method were positive by RT-PCR, indicating the presence of viable, metabolically active, intact bacteria in some culture-negative cases of OME.",

Hif is classified into the major (HifA) and minor (HifD and HifE) subunits, and both the major and minor subunits were required for adherence of H. influenzae to oropharyngeal epithelial cells (van Ham et al., 1995). However, immunologic and structural characteristics vary among NTHi (McCrea et al., 1998). In contrast, HMW adhesion proteins, HMW1 and HMW2, are members of a family of highly immunogenic proteins and are common to 70% to 75% of NTHi strains (Barenkamp and St Geme, 1996), suggesting the possibility of developing vaccine against diseases caused by NTHi including AOM and OME.",

They found that the abilities of mutants to induce OM and to persist in the middle ear were significantly decreased compared with the parent NTHi. Thus, the presence of intact LOS molecules appears to be critical to the virulence of NTHi in inducing OM. Moreover, Sun et al. (2000) reported that detoxified LOS-protein conjugates from NTHi elicited a significant rise of anti-LOS antibodies with bactericidal activity and inhibitory activity of the adherence of NTHi. Those data indicate the availability of detoxified LOS as a vaccine for OM.",

In those patients from whose nasopharynx RSV was isolated, the viral sequences were highly detectable in MEEs. Recently, Pitkaranta et al. (1998) reported that viral RNA of human rhinoviruses, RSV, and coronaviruses was detected in 48% of MEEs, 62% of nasopharyngeal aspirate samples, and in 57% of bacterianegative MEE samples collected from children with AOM at the time of diagnosis. Heikkinen et al. (1999) also examined the prevalence of various respiratory viruses in MEEs of 456 children with AOM. They detected RSV in 74% of samples, parainfluenza viruses in 52%, and influenza viruses in 42% of MEE, suggesting that RSV was the principal virus invading the middle ear during AOM. These findings highlight the importance of common respiratory viruses in predisposing young children to AOM and in causing this disease.",

They intranasally inoculated influenza viruses into adult subjects and found that S. pneumoniae was isolated from 15% of subjects on day 6, whereas the bacteria was not isolated before the virus challenge. Belshe et al. (1998) reported that live attenuated, cold-adapted, trivalent, intranasal influenza virus vaccine reduced the incidence of AOM during the epidemic of influenza. In an experimental study using mice, influenza A virus infection changed the glycoconjugate sequence of the surface of nasopharyngeal mucosa, and increased the colonization of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae inoculated after the virus infection (Hirano et al., 1999). Suzuki and Bakaletz (1994) demonstrated the synergistic effects between adenovirus and NTHi in inducing experimental OM. The attachment of P5-fimbriated NTHi to respiratory epithelial cells was significantly enhanced by RSV infection (Jiang et al., 1999). Those results indicate that viral infection might be the sole etiology of OM in some children and that preceding viral infection alters the defenses preventing bacterial colonization and invasion into the middle ear.",

On the other hand, Yamanaka and Faden (1993) reported that certain children, who are classified as otitis prone, do not respond well to P6, whereas non-otitis-prone individuals are more likely to develop a significant antibody response to P6. P6 is highly conserved among strains of NTHi and serves as a target for bactericidal antibody. DeMaria et al. (1996) demonstrated that subcutaneous immunization of chinchillas with P6 elevated serum bactericidal antibody activity against homologous as well as a heterologous NTHi isolate and reduced the incidence of NTHi culture-positive middle ear fluids after post-transbullar challenge with live NTHi. Further, Yamanaka and Faden (1993) reported that the concentration of P6-specific IgG in MEE was directly related to the concentration of anti-P6 antibody in serum and that the concentration of P6-specific IgG in MEE was inversely related to the number of bacteria in MEE.

Schousboe et al. (2001) investigated the relationship among microorganisms, endotoxin, and inflammatory mediators in OME and found positive correlation between endotoxin and inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in culture-positive MEEs as well as in culture-negative ones, suggesting endotoxin-induced local production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in the middle ear. Watanabe et al. (2001) further investigated the relationship between endotoxin and the production of IL-1\u03b2. They developed a murine model of OME by intratympanic injections with endotoxin derived from NTHi and with recombinant IL-1\u03b2. Anti-IL-1 receptor antibodies inhibited the pathologic changes induced by endotoxin and by recombinant IL-1\u03b2. These results suggest that IL-1\u03b2 is associated with the middle ear inflammation induced by endotoxin. Further, IL-1\u03b2 induces the production of IL-8, which is associated with the migration of neutrophils and the secretion of mucin from goblet cells (Smirnova et al., 2002).",

Mucosal immune response is regulated by immunoregulatory cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and TGF-\u03b2. IL-2 and IL-4 function primarily as general immune activators in immunoglobulin production and stimulate B cells already committed to IgM, IgG, or IgA to differentiate into plasma cells. IL-5 preferentially stimulates the proliferation and production of IgA-B cells already committed to this isotype. TGF-\u03b2 stimulates class-switching of IgM-B cells to an IgA phenotype. Bikhazi and Ryan (1995) investigated the expression of those immunoregulatory cytokines associated with the production of different antibody isotypes in experimental acute and chronic OME using in situ mRNA hybridization. They found that cells producing IL-2 and IL-4, but not IL-5, were present during acute OME. However, in chronic OME, IL-2- and IL-4-producing cells were less prevalent, but cells producing IL-5 were numerous. Cooter et al. (1998) demonstrated the presence of TGF-\u03b2 in the middle ear, and showed that TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b22 levels in MEEs are elevated in association with a history of previous tympanostomy tube placements and chronic mucoid effusion. Those results are consistent with the enhancement of IgG production in acute OME and increased local production of IgA during chronic OME. Further, the findings indicate the induction and enhancement of mucosal immune responses during the inflammatory process in the middle ear.",

These findings imply that there are highly effective antimicrobial defense systems, so called the innate immune system, protecting the tubotympanum other than the acquired immune system. The system consists of the mucociliary function of the tubotympanum and the molecules secreted by its epithelial cells, which create a highly effective barrier against invading pathogens and help to maintain the sterility of the middle ear cavity. Included in the molecules of the innate immune system are lysozyme, lactoferrin, defensins, and members of the collectin family of the surfactant proteins such as SP-A and SP-D (Bevins, 1999).

Boe et al. (1999) demonstrated the presence of human \u03b2-defensin-1 mRNA in the tympanic membrane and meatal skin by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization studies. Recently, Moon et al.

Further, they demonstrated that its expression is induced by proinflammatory stimuli such as IL-1\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1, and lipopolysaccharide. Although the involvement of these defensins in the defense of the eustachian tube and middle ear is yet to be proven, the potent microbicidal properties of defensins induced in the human middle ear epithelial cell line suggests that they may play a role in the pathogenesis of OM.",

On the other hand, subcutaneous immunization affected neither IgA antibody titer in nasal wash nor nasopharyngeal colonization by NTHi. DeMaria et al.

            "text": "It is well acknowledged that S-IgA antibody is induced by the mucosal immune system, which is anatomically and functionally divided into two compartments: inductive sites and effector sites. The inductive sites include the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT), and nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT). IgA precursor B cells in the inductive sites are primed and activated by mucosal immunization and disseminate throughout the mucosal effector sites such as nasal mucosa, nasopharyngeal mucosa, and salivary glands via the common mucosal immune system (McGhee and Kiyono, 1994). NALT has been identified as an inductive site of rodents, and the embryologic as well as immunologic characteristics recently have been investigated (Fukuyama et al., 2002). In humans, the adenoids and palatine tonsils are considered to act as NALT. Quiding-J\u00e4rbrink et al. (1995) showed that intratonsillar vaccination induced a substantial immune response such as IgG and IgA antibody-producing cells in tonsils. Further, primary immunization in one palatine tonsil followed by a second immunization of both palatine tonsils evoked a larger immune response in the primed tonsil. Sakamoto et al. (1998) demonstrated that the numbers of P6-specific IgA-producing cells in the adenoids were significantly correlated with IgA antibody titers in nasopharyngeal secretions. Those findings suggest that human palatine tonsils and adenoids serve as not only inductive sites but also effector sites of the mucosal immune system in the nasopharynx.",

            "text": "Recently, several studies demonstrated that middle ear mucosa has a function as an effector site of the mucosal immune system. Kodama et al. (2000) and Suenaga et al. (2001) examined the characteristics of the lymphocytes in the middle ear mucosa of mice at the single-cell level after intranasal immunization with P6 together with cholera toxin (Fig. 88.1\n). They found the induction of P6-specific IgA-producing cells into the middle ear mucosa and a similar cell population of T/B cells, CD4+/CD8+ cells, and \u03b1\u03b2 T cells between the middle ear mucosa and nasal mucosa after intranasal immunization. Further, the presence of a certain amount of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were observed in both middle ear and nasal mucosa, whereas no \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were found in the other lymphoid tissues such as NALT, cervical lymph nodes, spleen, or Peyer's patches. Those findings suggest that the middle ear mucosa has the same function to nasal mucosa as an effector site of the mucosal immune responses induced by intranasal immunization. Kodama et al. (2000) further investigated the T-cell responses in the middle ear mucosa of mice after intranasal immunization with P6. The data showed an increase of memory T cells as well as P6-specific IgA-B-cell in the middle ear mucosa after intranasal immunization. In vitro stimulation with P6 resulted in a proliferation of purified CD4+ T cells obtained from the middle ear mucosa of immunized mice, and those T cells expressed Th2 cytokine mRNA. Moreover, CD4+ T cells enabled IgA-B cells derived from NALT to differentiate into IgA plasma cells in the middle ear mucosa. Those findings suggest that antigen-specific IgA-B cells primed in NALT might home to the middle ear mucosa and differentiate into IgA-producing plasma cells with the help of Th2 cells recruited to the middle ear mucosa.",

            "text": "Because NTHi lack capsular polysaccharide, antigenic determinants of NTHi are outer membrane proteins. Among the outer membrane proteins, P6 is a highly conserved peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein present in all strains of NTHi. Kyd et al. (1995) have demonstrated that intra-Peyer's patch immunization with P6 followed by an intratracheal boost induced P6-specific CD4+ T-helper cell proliferation in lymphocytes isolated from the mesenteric lymph nodes and increased antibody response in both serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. However, the absence of enhanced pulmonary clearance in some animals suggests that the route of immunization might have affected the induction of mucosal immune responses in respiratory tract responsible for the pulmonary clearance of NTHi. To develop a useful vaccine delivery system to prevent OM, Kurono et al. (1999) compared the mucosal immune responses in mice immunized with NTHi antigen intranasally, orally, and intraperitoneally. The results showed that antigen-specific IgA antibody titers in nasal washes and the numbers of antigen-specific IgA-producing cells in nasal passages were significantly increased in intranasally immunized mice when compared with the other groups (\nFig. 88.2\n). Cytokine assay showed that IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, and IL-6 were predominantly produced in intranasal immunization, suggesting that Th2-as well as Th1-type cells were involved in the induction of antigen-specific immune response. Furthermore, bacterial clearance of a homologous strain of NTHi from the nasal tract was significantly enhanced in the nasal immunization group. These findings suggest that intranasal immunization is an effective vaccination regimen for the induction of antigen-specific mucosal immune responses in the upper respiratory tract.",

They found that intranasal immunization of mice with P6 together with cholera toxin evoked a good mucosal IgA as well as a systemic IgG response against P6 and increased the number of anti-P6-specific antibody-producing cells in the nasal mucosa of immunized mice. The protective effects of intranasal immunization were confirmed in vitro by the enhancement of nasopharyngeal clearance of NTHi and the inhibition of adherence of NTHi to cultured human epithelial cells. In another experiment, they reported that intranasal immunization with recombinant P6 together with cholera toxin also induced NTHi-specific mucosal and systemic immune responses (Hotomi et al., 2002). Sabirov et al. (2001) assessed the effect of intranasal immunization for the protection against NTHi-induced OM in mice. They found that the clearance of NTHi from the middle ear was remarkably enhanced and the incidence of NTHi-induced experimental OM was significantly reduced by intranasal immunization with P6 together with cholera toxin (\nTable 88.1\n). Further, immunized mice showed lower concentrations of TNF-\u03b1 in MEEs. These findings strongly suggest that P6 is a good potential vaccine candidate and intranasal vaccination with P6 affords protection against OM caused by NTHi.",
