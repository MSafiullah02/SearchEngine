            "text": "Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health threat caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) that most often affects the lungs (pulmonary TB) but can affect other sites as well (extrapulmonary TB). Fortunately, TB is a preventable and curable disease. Following the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 51 million patients have been successfully treated in countries that adopted the WHO strategy since 1995 [1]. However, the global burden of TB remains enormous. In 2011, there were an estimated 8.7 million new cases of TB (13% co-infected with HIV) and 1.4 million people died from TB [1]. In 2013, there were 9 million new TB cases and 1.5 million TB deaths (in which 0.4 million are HIV-positive patients) [2]. The increase of new cases lies in multiple factors such as the spread of HIV, the collapse of public health programs, the emergence of drug-resistant strains of Mtb [3], [4], [5] and exogenous re-infections, where a latently-infected individual acquires a new infection from another infectious individual (see, for example, [6], [7] and references therein). The TB control approach is the chemoprophylaxis treatment in the absence of an effective vaccine. Neglecting the compliance with drug treatments might result in a relapse and antibiotic resistant TB, i.e. multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) [8]. MDR-TB is one of the most serious health problems and the progress in curing that is slow. Critical funding gaps for TB care and control make it difficult to sustain recent gains, promote further research and develop new drugs and vaccines [1].",

            "text": "It is well known that the mathematical models play vital roles in the dynamics and control of many epidemics including malaria, severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) and TB (see, for example, [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17] and references therein). Many mathematical dynamic models for TB have been studied extensively in the literature; for instance we refer the reader to [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23]. \u201cFast progressors\u201d and \u201cslow progressors\u201d are two different ways considered by most models to progress to active disease after infection. The probability of latent and treated individuals who might be reinfected [24] is also taken into account by some latest models as the infection and/or disease do not confer full protection which is already well recognized [25]. Some previous models of TB, especially the predictive models endeavor to calculate a threshold called basic reproductive number. The dynamics of transmission of the disease has been analyzed in terms of the reduction of the basic reproductive number. Since the first paper published by Jung et al. [8] in 2002, the time dependent optimal control strategies have been employed in the study of dynamics of TB mathematical models by many authors (see, for example, [8], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34]). Valuable theoretical results generated by both approaches of studying control strategies can be used to guide epidemic control programs. Various objective criteria may be adopted, according to a chosen goal (or goals).",

The parameter \u039b represents the constant recruitment rate of susceptible individuals. Parameter p is the rate at which susceptible individuals are moved into the vaccination process. The natural death rate is \u00b5. The disease-induced death rate coefficient for individuals in compartment I is \u03b1. Parameter \u03c1 represents the rate that individuals successfully treated of TB return to the latent TB stage and parameter \u03b3 is the treatment rate in the infective class. It is assumed that the time before latent individuals become infectious obeys an exponential distribution, with mean waiting time 1\u03b4. Thus, \u03b4 is the rate at which an individual leaves the latent compartment to become infectious. Susceptible individuals acquire TB infection from individuals with active TB at rate \u03b2S(I+\u03c11T), where \u03b2 is the disease transmission coefficient, and the parameter \u03c1\n1 < 1 accounts for the reduction in infectiousness among individuals with active TB who are treated (in comparison to those who are not treated). Fraction l of susceptible individuals who acquire TB infection is assumed to enter the latent TB class (L), at the rate \u03b2S(I+\u03c11T), while the remainder moves to the active TB class (I). It is assumed that individuals in the latent class do not transmit infection. The vaccinated individuals are infected at rate \u03c12\u03b2V(I+\u03c11T), where \u03c1\n2 < 1 represents the reduction in risk of infection owing to vaccination (for a vaccine that offers 100% protection, \u03c12=0; thus in reality 0 < \u03c1\n2 < 1). For model (1.1), Liu and Zhang [24] first obtained the basic reproduction number\nR0=(\u03bc+\u03c1+\u03b3\u03c11)(\u03b2\u03b4\u03c12V0+\u03b2\u03b4S0+\u03b2\u03bc(1\u2212l)S0)(\u03bc+\u03b4)(\u03bc+\u03c1)(\u03bc+\u03b1+\u03b3)\u2212\u03b4\u03c1\u03b3,where\nS0=\u039b\u03bc+p,V0=\u039bp\u03bc(\u03bc+p).After that they showed that if the basic reproduction number R\n0 of the model system is below one then disease dies out otherwise it persists. This indicates that the basic reproduction number, R\n0, plays a crucial role in characterizing dynamics of the disease and could be used to suggest or design TB control strategies. However, they did not further investigate time dependent control strategies since their discussions had been concentrated on prevalence of TB at equilibria. Note that, for system (1.1), \u03c1 represents successful treatment rate. Computing the partial derivative of R\n0 with respect to \u03c1 gives that \u2202R0\u2202\u03c1|(1.1)<0 if \u03c11>\u03bc\u03b4(\u03bc+\u03b4)(\u03bc+\u03b1)+\u03bc\u03b3. Therefore, improving successful treatment rate helps to reduce TB infection when \u03c11>\u03bc\u03b4(\u03bc+\u03b4)(\u03bc+\u03b1)+\u03bc\u03b3. Using the fact that \u2202R0\u2202\u03b3|(1.1)<0 as long as \u03c11<\u03bc(\u03bc+\u03c1+\u03b4)(\u03bc+\u03b4)(\u03bc+\u03b1), Liu and Zhang [24] pointed out that the treatment of TB-infected individuals in the active stage would have positive impact if \u03c11<\u03bc(\u03bc+\u03c1+\u03b4)(\u03bc+\u03b4)(\u03bc+\u03b1). In other words, if \u03c1\n1 lies between two certain thresholds, then increasing \u03c1 and \u03b3 have positive meaning on controlling TB infection. Furthermore, \u2202R0\u2202p|(1.1)<0, also due to Liu and Zhang [24], which implies that increasing the vaccination rate of susceptible individuals against infection of TB is conducive to disease control.",

Three intervention strategies, called controls, are included in model system (1.1). We write controls as functions of time and assign reasonable upper and lower bounds to them. First, a \u201ccase finding\u201d (identification of latently infected individuals) control mechanism is incorporated in model (1.1) by replacing constant vaccination rate with u\n1(t). Second, a \u201ccase holding\u201d (treatment of individuals with active TB) control mechanism is incorporated in model (1.1) by replacing constant successfully treatment rate with u\n2(t). Finally, another \u201ccase holding\u201d is instituted in model (1.1) by replacing constant treatment rate with u\n3(t). It is required that u\n1(t), u\n2(t) and u\n3(t) are bounded Lebesgues integrable functions. We intend to determine optimal control strategies that minimize not only the infected individuals but also the cost of these three controls. As mentioned by Kumar and Srivastava [14], the larger proportion of population is covered, the higher efforts and expenditure is required to provide vaccination. Hence, it is suitable to use the nonlinearity of order four to describe the high expensiveness concerned with the vaccination process. Following the idea of Kumar and Srivastava [14], in this paper, the cost constructions that account for high nonlinear relationship (nonlinearity of order four i.e. u14(t)) between cost and efforts during vaccination process has been employed in the application of optimal control to TB mathematical models.",

The detailed analysis of optimal control problem is given in the following sections. The subsequent part of this paper is as follows: we present the formulation of the optimal control problems in Section 2. In Section 3, we investigate the existence of an optimal control function and derive an optimal system characterizing the optimal control. In Section 4, we analyze the uniqueness of the optimal system, in which the state system coupled with co-states.

Modeling the control cost is a more delicate issue. The cost involved in vaccination process requires relatively higher efforts and expenditure because of covering larger proportion of population. For example, vaccination efforts target first quarter of population will be less than the next quarter and so on. Therefore, the cost for covering larger proportion of population involved in vaccination process will be not only increasing but also growth of cost will be faster and steeper. Hence, we consider the biquadratic form in the vaccination control to represent high expensiveness of vaccination process [16]. That is, the cost involved in vaccination process is taken as \u222b0tfB4u14(t)dt. It is also assumed that cost of treatment is nonlinear and takes a quadratic nature, which is found to be consistent with previous works in the literature (see, e.g. [8]). In other words, the cost incurred in improving successfully treatment rate (the efforts such as regularity of drug intake) is taken as \u222b0tfB5u22(t)dt. Similarly, the cost incurred in providing treatment is taken as \u222b0tfB6u32(t)dt. The coefficients, Bi(i=1,2,\u2026,6) are the weight constants of the infected TB individuals and control measures. They can be chosen to balance cost factors due to size and importance of the parts of the objective functional.",

Suppose, for example, the variable S becomes zero for some time t\u00af>0, i.e. S(t\u00af)=0, while all other variables are nonnegative. Then, from the S equation, we have dS(t\u00af)dt>0.

To show that the two solutions are equivalent, it is convenient to make a change of variables.Let\nS=e\u03bbtx1,V=e\u03bbtx2,L=e\u03bbtx3,I=e\u03bbtx4,T=e\u03bbtx5,\u03bb1=e\u2212\u03bbty1,\u03bb2=e\u2212\u03bbty2,\u03bb3=e\u2212\u03bbty3,\u03bb4=e\u2212\u03bbty4,\u03bb5=e\u2212\u03bbty5,S\u00af=e\u03bbtx1\u00af,V\u00af=e\u03bbtx2\u00af,L\u00af=e\u03bbtx3\u00af,I\u00af=e\u03bbtx4\u00af,T\u00af=e\u03bbtx5\u00af,\u03bb1\u00af=e\u2212\u03bbty1\u00af,\u03bb2\u00af=e\u2212\u03bbty2\u00af,\u03bb3\u00af=e\u2212\u03bbty3\u00af,\u03bb4\u00af=e\u2212\u03bbty4\u00af,\u03bb5\u00af=e\u2212\u03bbty5\u00af,where \u03bb is a positive constant to be chosen later. With the new variables the optimality conditions become\nu1=min{max{0,((y1\u2212y2)x14B4)13},u1max};u2=min{max{0,(y5\u2212y3)x52B5},u2max};u3=min{max{0,(y4\u2212y5)x42B6},u3max};u1\u00af=min{max{0,((y1\u00af\u2212y2\u00af)x1\u00af4B4)13},u1max};u2\u00af=min{max{0,(y5\u00af\u2212y3\u00af)x5\u00af2B5},u2max};u3\u00af=min{max{0,(y4\u00af\u2212y5\u00af)x4\u00af2B6},u3max}.For ease of notation, we generally omit the dependence on time in the following except in the case that a specific time is intended. We consider the difference of the resulting equations for xi and xi\u00af,\nyi and yi\u00af,\ni=1,2,\u2026,5. From the first equation of (3.7), we get\ndx1dt+\u03bbx1=e\u2212\u03bbt\u039b\u2212\u03b2x1e\u03bbt(x4+\u03c11x5)\u2212(\u03bc+u1)x1and\ndx1\u00afdt+\u03bbx1\u00af=e\u2212\u03bbt\u039b\u2212\u03b2x1\u00afe\u03bbt(x4\u00af+\u03c11x5\u00af)\u2212(\u03bc+u1\u00af)x1\u00af.It follows from the above two equations that\n(4.1)dx1dt\u2212dx1\u00afdt+(\u03bb+\u03bc)(x1\u2212x1\u00af)=\u2212\u03b2e\u03bbt[x1(x4+\u03c11x5)\u2212x1\u00af(x4\u00af+\u03c11x5\u00af)]\u2212(u1x1\u2212u1\u00af\u00b7x1\u00af).Multiplying both sides of (4.1) by (x1\u2212x1\u00af) and then integrating both sides from 0 to tf, one has\n(4.2)12[x1(tf)\u2212x1\u00af(tf)]2+(\u03bb+\u03bc)\u222b0tf(x1\u2212x1\u00af)2dt=\u2212\u03b2\u222b0tfe\u03bbt[x1(x4+\u03c11x5)\u2212x1\u00af(x4\u00af+\u03c11x5\u00af)](x1\u2212x1\u00af)dt\u2212\u222b0tf(u1x1\u2212u1\u00af\u00b7x1\u00af)(x1\u2212x1\u00af)dt.In order to simplify the right-hand expressions of (4.2), we need some elementary inequalities. An elementary inequality (a+b)2\u22642(a2+b2) shows that\n|a\u2212b|6\u2264[2(a2+b2)]3=23(a6+3a4b2+3a2b4+b6)\u226423(a6+(a6+a6+b6)+(a6+b6+b6)+b6)=32(a6+b6).It follows that |a\u2212b|\u226432(a6+b6)6 and thus\n(4.3)|a13\u2212b13|\u226432(a2+b2)6.By the elementary inequality (a+b)2\u22642(a2+b2), we have\n(4.4)(x1y1\u2212x1\u00af\u00b7y1\u00af)2=(x1y1\u2212x1y1\u00af+x1y1\u00af\u2212x1\u00af\u00b7y1\u00af)2=[x1(y1\u2212y1\u00af)+y1\u00af(x1\u2212x1\u00af)]2\u2264max{2x12,2y1\u00af2}[(x1\u2212x1\u00af)2+(y1\u2212y1\u00af)2]\u2264C[(x1\u2212x1\u00af)2+(y1\u2212y1\u00af)2],where C depends on bounds for x1,y1\u00af.Another inequality is also needed to obtain the specific estimate: If 0 \u2264 b \u2264 a, then a3\u2212b3\u2264a\u2212b3. Using Proposition 4.1 and the above inequalities, we have the following estimation of |u1\u2212u1\u00af|2. We divide our estimation in five cases as follows.(I) case of x1(y1\u2212y2)x1\u00af(y1\u00af\u2212y2\u00af)\u22640. It follows from (4.3) that\n|u1\u2212u1\u00af|2\u2264(14B4)23|(x1(y1\u2212y2))13\u2212(x1\u00af(y1\u00af\u2212y2\u00af))13|2\u2264(14B4)23323(x1(y1\u2212y2))2+(x1\u00af(y1\u00af\u2212y2\u00af))23\u2264(14B4)23323[x1(y1\u2212y2)\u2212x1\u00af(y1\u00af\u2212y2\u00af)]23\u2264(14B4)2332M3(x1\u2212x1\u00af)2+(y1\u2212y1\u00af)2+(y2\u2212y2\u00af)23.where M depends on bounds for x1\u00af,y1,y2.(II) case of x1(y1\u2212y2)>x1\u00af(y1\u00af\u2212y2\u00af)>0. By the inequality a3\u2212b3\u2264a\u2212b3 and (4.4), one has\n|u1\u2212u1\u00af|2\u2264(14B4)23|(x1(y1\u2212y2))13\u2212(x1\u00af(y1\u00af\u2212y2\u00af))13|2\u2264(14B4)23[x1(y1\u2212y2)\u2212x1\u00af(y1\u00af\u2212y2\u00af)]23\u2264(14B4)23M3(x1\u2212x1\u00af)2+(y1\u2212y1\u00af)2+(y2\u2212y2\u00af)23.\n(III) case of x1\u00af(y1\u00af\u2212y2\u00af)>x1(y1\u2212y2)>0. By means of a3\u2212b3\u2264a\u2212b3 and (4.4), we get\n|u1\u2212u1\u00af|2\u2264(14B4)23|(x1(y1\u2212y2))13\u2212(x1\u00af(y1\u00af\u2212y2\u00af))13|2=(14B4)23[x1\u00af(y1\u00af\u2212y2\u00af)3\u2212x1(y1\u2212y2)3]2\u2264(14B4)23[x1\u00af(y1\u00af\u2212y2\u00af)\u2212x1(y1\u2212y2)]23\u2264(14B4)23M3(x1\u2212x1\u00af)2+(y1\u2212y1\u00af)2+(y2\u2212y2\u00af)23.\n(IV) case of x1(y1\u2212y2)<x1\u00af(y1\u00af\u2212y2\u00af)<0.

For example, if we fix \u03bb>M1+M3+M4+M7+M8+N1+N2+N6\u2212\u03bc and\ntf<1\u03bbln(\u03bb+\u03bc)\u2212(N1+N2+N6)M1+M3+M4+M7+M8,then the coefficient (\u03bb+\u03bc)\u2212(M1+M3+M4+M7+M8)e\u03bbtf\u2212(N1+N2+N6) for the integral \u222b0tf(x1\u2212x1\u00af)2dt will be nonnegative. Similar arguments apply to remaining integral terms, we can obtain all of the other \u03bbs and tfs. Take the maximum of all of the \u03bbs used as \u03bb and the minimum of the tfs used as tf, then the coefficient of each integral term in (4.15) is nonnegative. This implies that\nx1=x1\u00af,x2=x2\u00af,x3=x3\u00af,x4=x4\u00af,x5=x5\u00af,y1=y1\u00af,y2=y2\u00af,y3=y3\u00af,y4=y4\u00af,y5=y5\u00afand\nS=S\u00af,V=V\u00af,L=L\u00af,I=I\u00af,T=T\u00af,\u03bb1=\u03bb1\u00af,\u03bb2=\u03bb2\u00af,\u03bb3=\u03bb3\u00af,\u03bb4=\u03bb4\u00af,\u03bb5=\u03bb5\u00af.Hence the solution of (3.7) is unique for small time. This ends the proof. \u25a1\nRemark 4.1We note that Theorem 4.1 shows that the solution of (3.7) is unique when tf is small. As pointed out by Lenhart and Workman [36], we can usually obtain uniqueness of the solutions for (3.7), but only for small time tf. This small time condition is due to reverse time orientations of the state equation and adjoint equation.\n",

With the application of the current iteration solution of the state equations (1.2) and the transversality conditions (3.3), the adjoint system (3.2) is solved backward in time, again, by a fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme.

In Figs. 1\n\u20135, the population with optimal control actions are shown in solid lines, compared with the population without control actions which are shown in dashed lines. We observe from Fig. 1 that the susceptible population is higher under control compared to the case without control. The results in Fig. 2 predict a higher level of vaccinated population for the aforementioned tuberculosis intervention strategies under control compared to the case without control. The results depicted in Figs. 3 and 4 clearly suggest that the optimal control results are very effective in control of individuals infected with TB in latent stage and in the active stage, as expected. In Fig. 5, the population of treated humans declines sharply in the first 18 years and after that decrease further, while Fig. 4 shows slight increase in the last two years of the intervention strategy. This is due to the fact that the treatment control u\n3 becomes zero after 18 years. The simulation results in Fig. 6 suggest that this strategy would require that the vaccination control u\n1 should be at maximum for almost the entire period of intervention, while treatment controls u\n2 and u\n3 should maintain maximum efforts for 13 years and 18 years respectively before decreasing to zero.",
