A common complication of STEC infection is hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which affects 5%\u201310% of ill persons (1, 3).",

STEC O157 is the most commonly reported serogroup (4) and was also the dominant STEC described in our review, accounting for 22 of 29 outbreaks. The O104 serogroup that caused the German outbreak accounted for 3 outbreaks; hence, the paucity of outbreaks caused by non-O157 serogroups may be responsible for the nonsignificant association between serogroup and incubation period. Despite this, all outbreaks associated with the O104 serogroup were clustered in 1 subgroup, which had the longest incubation period. Serotype and toxin type were the information most often reported from outbreaks; the outbreaks we studied lacked more detailed microbial characterization. As routine STEC genome sequencing increases, testing of a wider range of pathogen factors for association with incubation period will be possible. The observed clustering of the O104 outbreaks within the same incubation-time subgroup (Web Figure 3) (19\u201321, 29), which outbreaks shared both a pathogen lineage, and a transmission route through contaminated beansprouts support the potential importance of these factors in affecting incubation period.",

Even acknowledging that 3 of these 7 outbreaks were from the outbreaks (19\u201321) within the large German O104 outbreak (14) with identifiable incubation times and 1 from a related O104 outbreak in France (29), this large cluster of outbreaks with longer-than-expected incubation times highlights the risks associated with restricting investigation to exposures occurring within expected incubation-time distributions.

Where data for occurrence of diarrhea and HUS were available, we observed a period of 4\u20137 days between onset of diarrhea and onset of HUS, similar to that reported by Razzaq (35). In our review, most of the case definitions used by authors included diarrhea or bloody diarrhea without HUS; a few included all 3 clinical outcomes. We observed that in studies in which all clinical outcomes were reported, including HUS, a longer mean incubation period was recorded than in other studies; however, we did not identify a significant association between HUS and the length of incubation period, as also reported by Werber et al (22). We suspect that some of the heterogeneity we observed in the incubation-period distribution across outbreaks may be explained by the differences in the case definitions. Reporting with more specific case definitions and even separation of results across cases on the basis of different symptoms is thus an example of a feature of standard reporting that could promote better evidence synthesis.",

For these questions, individual patient data allowing analysis of host factors such as premorbidity, ongoing medications, and dose are required, as well as outbreak-level characteristics such as mode of transmission and pathogen characteristics. This raises questions on how best to capture, store, and make accessible data from individual outbreaks in a way that will allow joint analysis and align with the increasing trend toward individual-patient data meta-analysis in the synthesis of randomized, controlled trial evidence.",

Therefore, there is little possibility of encountering publication bias or selection bias due to the reported incubation period. Furthermore, we found no evidence of small-study effect. Although focusing on sharing information on incubation period protected against publication bias, it no doubt contributed to the exclusion of studies, with the majority of studies we identified not meeting the quality assessment criteria for reporting of incubation period. Extracting individual data involved using an online data-extraction tool and a manual process of selecting each data point, which is open to human error and could alter the reported incubation period. However, these errors are likely to be small. Results, therefore, are not likely to be substantially biased, although they are based on a restricted number of studies in which usable data were reported.",

We identified age and attack rate as factors that may influence the distribution of incubation period. However, there was insufficient information to explain the relationship between these factors and incubation period or to study the impact of many individual patient-level factors on incubation period. Our work highlights the opportunities afforded for information synthesis across outbreaks to support evidence-based practice and the challenges to be overcome to optimize reporting and ultimately support combined analysis across outbreaks if the full potential of these natural experiments is to be exploited.",
