Variations of ambient temperature considerably modify insect internal temperature, as they are poikilotherms. Those variations greatly affect vector physiology and expose the pathogens they carry to ambient temperature [6, 8]. In laboratory, viral replication kinetics in mosquito-cultured cells has shown to depend on temperature, since higher temperatures lead to a more efficient viral attachment and cell infection [9, 10].",

Urban populations in Africa and Asia and those in Latin America and the Caribbean are expected to increase by almost 50% [23, 24].

As an example, during the 2014 FIFA Football World Cup in Brazil, mathematical models estimated 33 cases of DENV (range 3\u201359 cases) among foreign tourists, of nearly 600,000 of expected visitors [18, 19]. So far, only 3 cases of DENV were reported associated to this sport event [16, 20]. It\u2019s postulated that the low numbers of cases finally diagnosed of DENV were the result of a year with an unusually low incidence in Brazil, probably due to a severe drought in 2014, reducing the number of expected cases in visitors.

Therefore, returning ZIKV-viremic travellers to European countries may become a source of local transmission in the presence of this suitable vector. Previously, Aedes mosquito was implicated in local transmission of CHiKV and DENV in Mediterranean countries [4, 39, 40]. The species have also been responsible for outbreaks of yellow fever in Italy in 1804 [4, 41]. The existence of previous autochthonous arboviriasis transmitted by the same vector, make the infection by ZIKV also feasible in Western Europe at least seasonally, when competent vector species are present. The arrival of summer in North Hemisphere is linked to a peak in mosquito Aedes population and a most efficient viral replication, so from June to September climatic influence could also favour the establishment of ZIKV disease in Europe [42].",

In this specific autonomous region of Portugal two main factors are present: the presence of Ae.
