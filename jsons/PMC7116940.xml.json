            "text": "Cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis), a member of the Brassicaceae family, is an economically and nutritionally important cole crop. The optimum mean temperature range for growing cauliflower is 18\u201325 \u00b0C. High temperatures cause cauliflower to form uneven and loose heads, puffy buds, yellow eyes and leaves in the head, narrow leaves, reduced leaf growth, delayed initiation of heading, and increased petiole-to-blade ratio, all of which lower the quality of or even make the heads unmarketable (Wurr et al., 1996, Nowbuth and Pearson, 1998). However, heat-tolerant cultivars are able to form heads at mean temperatures higher than 25 \u00b0C. To expand the area of food production, crops are grown under stressful environments that likely lead to lower yields. The main contributing factors in the reduction of yield and quality in these areas are variations in climatic conditions such as flooding caused by rains (Lin et al., 2010). Heavy rainstorms and standing water can leave soils saturated for days before draining, making waterlogging a problem in many parts of the world. Air pockets in the soil become filled with water during saturation, thus creating hypoxic conditions followed by anoxia. Flooding causes oxygen starvation, which is a consequence of the relatively slow diffusion of gases in water and from oxygen consumption by plant roots (Takeshi and Julia, 2004). Rapid leaf chlorosis is seen when cauliflower is subjected to waterlogging (Shih et al., 2013). Flooding from large rainfall events is a major risk to fresh-market cauliflower production in Taiwan, and most cauliflower cultivars are unable to tolerate flooding during typhoon-caused heavy summer rains. Waterlogging and increasing temperatures associated with global warming are a growing concern, as they limit plant growth and productivity, especially in temperate species. Over the past decade in the tropics and subtropics, there have been considerable increases in production because of the availability of new, tropically adapted cultivars, resulting in increased farmer incomes.",

            "text": "In the field, the co-occurrence of several abiotic stresses rather than individual stresses are most damaging to crop production (Mittler, 2006). Many physiological changes occur during high temperature and flood stressing that result in increased heat and flood (HF) tolerance. The physiological mechanisms of HF tolerance are extensively studied in various plant species; however, our current understanding of the molecular biology of acquired tolerances to high temperature and waterlogging are still limited, and relatively little is known about proteins that are critical for controlling these dual mechanisms (Wahid et al., 2007). Understanding these processes requires the identification and analysis of major proteins that underlie stress-regulatory networks. Plant adaptations to environmental stresses depend on the activation of cascades of molecular networks involved in stress perception, signal transduction, and the expression of stress-related proteins. Knowledge of HF-responsive proteins is critical for further understanding of the molecular mechanisms of stress tolerance. Plants respond to stress in part by modulating protein regulation, which eventually leads to restoration of cellular homeostasis, neutralization of toxins, and recovery of growth. However, there are no reports on the effect of HF stresses on the functioning of cauliflower. Proteins are the direct effectors of the response of plants to stress. They not only include enzymes that mediate changes in the levels of metabolites but also serve as components of the transcription and translation machinery.",

            "text": "In recent years, methods for analyzing the proteome have advanced considerably, and together with emerging sequence information in crops, plant proteomics has become increasingly useful for understanding gene functioning and networks in response to environmental stimuli. Proteomics is a powerful tool for the quantitative analyses of different biochemical pathways including plant stress-related responses. Comparative proteomic analyses of plants subjected to specific stress conditions allow the exploration of various defense-related mechanisms. For instance, proteomics approaches for the comparative analysis of protein abundance between untreated and stress-treated or tolerant and intolerant rice plants have greatly facilitated the study of plant cellular stress responses (Komatsu et al., 2003). Therefore, identifying novel proteins and studying their differential display patterns in response to HF stresses will provide the molecular and physiological bases for improving tolerance to HF by cauliflowers. Understanding the basis of HF stress signaling and tolerance mechanisms in cauliflowers is required for engineering local cauliflower genotypes that are more tolerant to heat and flood stressing. This goal can be achieved by deciphering the physiological and proteomic responses of cauliflower genotypes, heat-tolerant \u2018H41\u2019, flood-tolerant \u2018H69\u2019, and HF-sensitive \u2018H71\u2019 to flood stress at 40 \u00b0C. The objective of this study was to identify the leaf proteins that are differentially regulated in response to HF stress using a ProteomeLab PF-2D aided by improved databases. Our hypothesis was that both HF stresses trigger plant responses that result in quantifiable changes in the proteins of \u2018H41\u2019, \u2018H69\u2019, and \u2018H71\u2019. Proteomic characterization and functional analysis should facilitate a better understanding of the HF response mechanisms in Brassica so that effective strategies for the genetic improvement of HF-tolerant plant cultivars can be established. To the best of our knowledge, there are no published reports addressing the identification of HF-responsive proteins in Brassica using a proteomic approach.",

(Tainan, Taiwan). \u2018H41\u2019 is a heat-tolerant cultivar used especially in warm-subtropical regions such as southern Taiwan, where average day temperatures reach as high as 40 \u00b0C during the summer (June\u2013August). \u2018H69\u2019 is a popular cultivar grown in Taiwan and is flood-tolerant during the rainy season, particularly in rain-fed lowlands. \u2018H71\u2019 is a heat- and flood-sensitive cultivar, and mostly grown during winter in Taiwan due to its cold tolerance. Seeds were sterilized with 1.5% (v/v) sodium hypochlorite, rinsed with distilled-deionized (dd) H2O, and sown in a commercial potting soil mixture, and germinated seedlings were transplanted into 12.7-cm diameter plastic pots and raised in a growth chamber under 300 \u03bcmol m\u22122\n s\u22121 light with a 14 h photoperiod and 22/18 \u00b0C day/night temperatures at a relative humidity (RH) of 80%. Plants were watered three times a week and fertilizer (17:36:39, N:P:K) applied once a week to maintain optimal growth for 30 days before the imposition of stress treatments. Pots containing \u2018H41\u2019 and \u2018H69\u2019 plants were subjected to four treatments: non-flooding at 20 \u00b0C (NFC, as control), flooding at 20 \u00b0C (FC, control temperature), non-flooding at 40 \u00b0C (NFH, high temperature), and flooding at 40 \u00b0C (FH), for periods of 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h in four growth chambers having a 14 h photoperiod at 300 \u03bcmol m\u22122\n s\u22121 radiation and 80% RH (Lin et al., 2010). In the case of flooding treatments, pots were randomly placed in 28 cm \u00d7 14 cm \u00d7 14 cm plastic buckets and subjected to flooding by filling the buckets with tap water to 5 cm above the soil surface. Pots were removed from the buckets at different times following flooding, and plants were removed and their leaves from each plant clipped, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C in an ultra-freezer until used. Three replicates of each time period for the four treatments were randomly placed in a growth chamber. The experiment was performed twice independently in a randomized design for growth environment, sampling day, and physiological analyses.",

The initial conductivity of the water was determined using a conductivity meter (model CDM 210, Radiometer, Cedex, France). Tubes were placed in boiling water for 15 min and then cooled to room temperature, and conductivity was again determined. The relative EL (%) was calculated as the ratio of conductivity before boiling to that after boiling. CF components were quantified with a portable modulated fluorometer (Mini-Pam Photosynthesis Yield Analyzer, Walz, Effeltrich, Germany). The measurement of variable fluorescence to (Fv)/maximum fluorescence level in light-adapted leaves (Fv/Fm) was previously described (Lin et al., 2007). Relative CC per unit leaf area was determined using a SPAD (Soil Plant Analysis Development) analyzer (SPAD-502 Chlorophyll Meter, Konica Minolta, Tokyo, Japan).

Trypsin was specified as the proteolytic enzyme. Peptide tolerance and MS/MS mass tolerance were 50 ppm and 0.25 Da, respectively. Peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) match confidence was based on the MOWSE score and confirmed by accurate overlapping of matched peptides with mass spectrum major peaks.

Table 1 illustrates the comparison of Fv/Fm values under four treatments at seven different times in leaves of three genotypes of cauliflower. Levels of Fv/Fm in all plants progressively decreased as flood stress and heat stress (NFH and FH) durations were extended. Fv/Fm in \u2018H41\u2019 plants showed significantly lower values after 6 h with flooding treatments (FC and FH) compared to 0 h, and the lowest values (0.304 and 0.002) were found at 96 h under FC and FH treatments, respectively. However, significant decreases in the Fv/Fm ratio of \u2018H41\u2019 plants were observed as late as 48 h under heat treatment (NFH). In addition, when treatments were compared across stressing times of 6\u201396 h, both control (NFC) and NFH treatments exhibited significantly higher Fv/Fm values than FC and FH treatments, indicating that \u2018H41\u2019 is a heat-tolerant cultivar, and this increase in Fv/Fm value was clearly evident with the 40 \u00b0C treatment (NFH). Slight decreases in Fv/Fm values were noted in \u2018H69\u2019 plants with FC treatment as flood stress time was extended, but high temperature treatments (NFH and FH) rapidly decreased Fv/Fm values in \u2018H69\u2019 over time. \u2018H69\u2019 Fv/Fm values over time under NFC and FC treatments were both significantly higher compared to NFH and FH treatments, suggesting that \u2018H69\u2019 is a flood-tolerant cultivar, and this increase in Fv/Fm value was obvious in the flooding-alone treatment (FC). Fv/Fm values in \u2018H71\u2019 plants under stressed treatments (FC, NFC, and FH) appeared to be significantly lower than under NFC after 6 h of treatment, indicating that \u2018H71\u2019 is not a flood- or heat-tolerant cultivar.",

            "text": "A soil water potential of approximately \u22122 MPa was used in greenhouse experiments to simulate field situations under severe stress conditions (Ashoub et al., 2013). The leaf WP of \u2018H71\u2019 plants under high-temperature treatment was significantly lower than in \u2018H41\u2019 and \u2018H69\u2019 plants after 12 h, indicating that \u2018H71\u2019 plants suffered from heat exposure. A lower osmotic potential is responsible for maintaining turgor when water loss occurs due to high temperature. Thus, high electrical conductivity due to a high concentration of electrolytes in the leaf sap of \u2018H71\u2019 plants should lead to alterations in membrane permeability and a reduced ability to retain solutes and water during high temperature and waterlogging. However, the ability of \u2018H41\u2019 and \u2018H69\u2019 plants to tolerate heat and flood stress, respectively, strongly depends on adjustments in water balance and ionic leakage. A decline in WP and an increase in EL during heat and flood stress were associated with leaf water deficits as well as increases in ionic leakage. At the physiological level, the many effects of flooding and heat stresses indicate the importance of protecting plants from oxidative damage caused by the overproduction of ROS that is elicited by increased ion leakage (Kangasjarvi et al., 2008). The chlorophyll fluorescence emission parameter, Fv/Fm, which is widely used as a proxy for the maximum quantum efficiency of PS II photochemistry, was correlated with flooding and high temperature tolerance. In healthy leaves, the Fv/Fm value is close to 0.8, which is a typical value for uninhibited plants. A lower value indicates that some proportion of the PSII reaction centers are damaged, which is often observed in plants under stress (Camejo et al., 2006). Flooding and high temperatures inhibit photosynthetic CO2 fixation and damages photosynthetic electron transport at the site of PSII where there exists a very sensitive photosynthesis apparatus. This reduction in the CO2 assimilation rate observed in \u2018H71\u2019 plants was generated by effects on the Calvin cycle and also on PSII functioning. Exposure of \u2018H71\u2019 plants to flooding and high temperature may lead to reductions in net photosynthetic rate, stomatal closure, and cell activities that damage photosynthetic membranes (Jiang and Huang, 2001). These results suggested that the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were stress specific and were not expressed solely in response to an increasing excess of photon energy. Chloroplast development in \u2018H71\u2019 plants may be particularly sensitive to high temperature and flooding. Alternatively, the pigments of the sensitive cultivar might have been destroyed because of a high sensitivity to oxidative stress. \u2018H71\u2019 plants suffered greater CC losses than \u2018H41\u2019 and \u2018H69\u2019 plants after 24\u201396 h of exposure. Flooding and heat may induce stomatal closure and consequently reduce CC levels and WP as well. Typically, the amount of CC is reduced by stress. This is consistent with our observations that chlorophyll loss was more pronounced in waterlog- and heat-sensitive \u2018H71\u2019 plants in accordance with the more pronounced and increased visible symptoms of leaf injury. Leaf curling or folding were the initial and most obvious changes observed. Most \u2018H71\u2019 leaves progressively became necrotic, epinastic, or wilted over the course of time; however, most \u2018H41\u2019 and \u2018H69\u2019 leaves visually appeared to be green and healthy after 72 h of flooding and high temperature (photos not shown). Along with visual symptoms, reduced CC could be used to monitor flooding and heat damage in green or senescent leaves. Attempts have been made to breed for increased flooding tolerance and modify Brassica cultivation or management practices to avoid injury from flooding and heat.",

            "text": "Proteomics techniques are becoming indispensable for understanding how plants adapt to abiotic stresses, and have promoted the identification of numerous stress-related proteins and the pathways in which they function (Kosov\u00e1 et al., 2011). Changes in protein accumulation under stress are directly related to the physiological phenotypic responses of plants to stress. The proteomic responses to high-temperature or flood stresses are known for several plants, including rice (Lin et al., 2005), wheat (Majoul et al., 2004), barley (S\u00fcle et al., 2004), soybean (Komatsu et al., 2013), radish (Zhang et al., 2013), Arabidopsis thaliana (Palmblad et al., 2008), Agave americana (Shakeel et al., 2013), and Populus euphratica (Ferreira et al., 2006). In the present study, we analyzed physiological and proteomics data in different genotypes of cauliflower under conditions of high-temperature and waterlogging stresses over different time periods. Approximately 250 peaks were detected at the tested time points, whereas 85 peaks were successfully observed to be differentially regulated (14 down-regulated, 71 up-regulated) and expressed at a minimum of one time point. Among them, 33, 29, and 9 proteins were identified in \u2018H41\u2019, \u2018H69\u2019, and \u2018H71\u2019 plants, respectively, indicating that they were regulated in a genotype-specific manner (Supplementary Fig. S5). Rubisco small and large chains, 16 kDa calcium-binding protein, molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis protein A, and phosphoserine aminotransferase were observed in both \u2018H41\u2019 and \u2018H69\u2019 plants. Phosphoribosylformyl glycinamidine synthase and arginyl-tRNA synthetase were both found in \u2018H71\u2019 and \u2018H69\u2019 plants (Supplementary Fig. S5). Moreover, in \u2018H41\u2019 plants, peaks 253 and 254 were both identified as DNA mismatch repair protein mutS, while 291 and 263 were identified as phosphoglucosamine mutase (Table 5, Table 7). These sister peaks may represent close homologues, but this could not be resolved based on mass spectrometric data and might instead be isoforms resulting from differential post-translational modifications (Rollins et al., 2013). As stress times increased, additional responsive proteins continued to be identified. For instance, 5 (Table 5) and 30 (Table 7) peaks were observed in \u2018H41\u2019 under stress treatments for 6 h and 24 h, respectively. In this study, some of the proteins identified were well characterized in terms of response to stressing, while others were not. The biological functions of differentially regulated proteins include roles in photosynthesis, energy metabolism, cellular homeostasis, response to stimuli, transcription and translation, protein biosynthesis, mediation of signal transduction, and other functions.",

            "text": "For survival, plants must respond to flood and heat stresses in a different manner from regulating protein expressions for biochemical and physiological adaptations. Photosynthesis is one of the systems that is most sensitive to high-temperature stress. Changes in environmental temperatures are primarily reflected in photosynthesis, triggering a response that is aimed toward the best possible performance under new conditions. For this, a balance is sought between the energy of absorbed light, carbon assimilation, and consumption by metabolic sinks. Several studies have shown that high-temperature stress can significantly inhibit the rate of photosynthesis (Yan et al., 2013, Salvucci and Crafts-Brandner, 2004). In our study, Rubisco units (small and large chain) related to photosynthesis were differentially expressed and regulated by combination treatments and among genotypes. For example, the up-regulation of Rubisco was detected in \u2018H41\u2019 (peaks 236 and 255, Table 7) and \u2018H69\u2019 (peaks 2312, 2314, 2818, 222,223, 2310, 2311, 246, 247, and 268, Table 8). However, the level of expression of the Rubisco large subunit was down-regulated in \u2018H69\u2019 during FH treatment for 24 h (peaks 2511, 264, and 266, Table 8). Rubisco proteins resist high-temperature and flood stresses by inhibiting photosynthesis and other nonessential metabolic processes. In contrast, to increase energy metabolism, the expression of proteins related to redox homeostasis and response to stimuli were up-regulated, thereby maintaining physiological balance during stress. Rubisco catalyzes the first major step of carbon fixation in photosynthesis. Affinity of Rubisco for CO2 decreases with increasing temperature (Yan et al., 2013). The diminished capacity of Rubisco and its low affinity for CO2 suggest that carbon fixation or assimilation was highly inhibited when \u2018H69\u2019 plants were exposed to stress, especially under the high temperature and flooding stresses (Table 8) that lead to reduced rates of photosynthetic CO2 assimilation. Photorespiration serves as an energy sink, preventing the over-reduction of the photosynthetic electron transport chain and photoinhibition. Lee et al. (2007) reported that high temperature over 2 h significantly inhibits the activity and quantity of Rubisco subunits in rice seedlings. The effects of drought stress on Rubisco represent reductions in Rubisco activity (Parry et al., 2002). Exposure to salt stress brings about a reduction in the overall growth and productivity of plants by disturbing the function of vital components of photosynthesis, such as PSII and Rubisco (Ghaffaria et al., 2014). Consequently, a strong reduction in Fv/Fm value (Table 1) and CC content (Table 2) while maintaining photosynthesis under stress after 24 h was seen in all plants. Some researchers report its up-regulation (Ge et al., 2012, Budak et al., 2013), whereas others find down-regulation (Gaoa et al., 2011) or even both (Guoa et al., 2012) in response to abiotic stresses. As a result, an up-regulation in Rubisco levels may also indicate an increase in the photorespiration rate.",

            "text": "Molecular chaperones, including heat shock proteins (HSPs), are key components of innate immunity in plants. They have major roles in protein folding and signal-transduction networks, cell-cycle control, protein degradation, and protein trafficking (Wang et al., 2004). HSP chaperone pathways require energy in the form of ATP hydrolysis in order to function. The ATP-dependent Clp proteases (HSP100) represent a class of HSP. In addition to their function as molecular chaperones, they function in protein disaggregation and protein degradation when removal of potentially harmful polypeptides arising from misfolding, denaturation, or aggregation are important for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. The mechanism for rescuing proteins from aggregation is proposed to include the cooperation HSP100 (Kregel, 2002, Sarkar et al., 2011). HSPs are typically induced when cells are exposed to various types of environmental stresses. The synthesis of HSPs under high temperatures is reported to be related to thermo-tolerance in plants, and plants with a decreased expression of HSPs show compromised tolerance to acquired thermo-tolerance (Charng et al., 2006). HSPs are closely related to the acquisition of heat resistance in plants. Choi et al. (2012) identify several high molecular weight HSPs whose expression was up-regulated significantly in Pyropia tenera under high-temperature stress for 1 h and 3 h. Furthermore, Lee et al. (2007) report that several HSPs are expressed in rice leaves during heat stress. High temperature might increase the potential risk of protein misfolding, and an active protein quality control system inside cells plays an important role in plant tolerance to heat stress. HSPs are also increased by drought stress in the sugar beet (Hajheidari et al., 2005), wheat (Demirevska et al., 2008), and sugarcane (Jangpromma et al., 2010). In our study, peak 261 of ATP-dependent Clp protease proteolytic subunit 1 was up-regulated in response to heat stress for 24 h in \u2018H41\u2019 plants (Table 7). This suggests that the increased level of HSP100 under high-temperature stress allowed the heat-tolerant \u2018H41\u2019 to produce more energy through ATP hydrolysis and the degradation or reactivation of damaged proteins and prevented protein misfolding, resulting in reestablishing normal protein conformations and cellular homeostasis.",

SAM in shoots underwent increased protein synthesis in a heat-tolerant barley cultivar and showed a reduced trend in an abiotic stress-susceptible cultivar (S\u00fcle et al., 2004). In our study, the expression of SAM synthetase was significantly up-regulated (peak 294, Table 5) in heat stressed \u2018H41\u2019 over 6 h. Therefore, it is most likely that an increased amount of SAM synthetase (as a result of the increased formation of SAM methyl donors) in \u2018H41\u2019 contributes to its stronger heat tolerance compared to controls.

The elongation of polypeptide chains during translation is a conserved process among prokaryotes and eukaryotes. EFs are the critical regulators of protein synthesis, which is influenced by high temperature and drought stress in Arabidopsis (Rizhsky et al., 2004) and rapeseed (Mohammadi et al., 2012). Regulation of the transcriptional and translational machinery is considered to be an important component of cellular stress response. The increased expression of EF greA in \u2018H69\u2019 and EF G in \u2018H71\u2019 likely led to increased protein synthesis, which served to reduce the effects of treatment stress.",

A 16 kDa calcium-binding protein was identified as an up-regulated peak (301) under flooding (Table 1), suggesting the involvement of intracellular calcium homeostasis and signal transduction in \u2018H41\u2019 during waterlogging.",

Up-regulation of the 50S ribosomal protein L11P (# 2914) was observed under high temperature stress at 24 h in \u2018H69\u2019 (Table 8), indicating the resistance of \u2018H69\u2019 plants to the inhibitory effect of high temperature on protein biosynthesis. In addition, pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are characterized by tandem arrays of degenerate 35 amino acid motifs (O\u2019Toole et al., 2008) and are thought to be RNA binding proteins involved in posttranscriptional processes in mitochondria and chloroplasts (Schmitz-Linneweber et al., 2006). Meanwhile, PPR proteins are also essential for RNA editing in chloroplasts (Emi et al., 2005).

Our data suggest that the early response of cauliflower to flooding and high temperature might be an important stress adaptation for survival following not only hypoxia and heat, but also direct damage to cells by flooding and high temperature. All of the identified proteins likely work cooperatively to reestablish cellular homeostasis under stress. The long term goal of our work is to help breed a competitively higher flood- and heat-tolerant cauliflower to be grown in lowlands during summer. The identification of the unique stress-responsive proteins will allow further dissection of the genetic basis of this transgressive performance in offspring. Our results not only provide information for selecting lines having better tolerance to waterlogging and heat stresses, but also provide a basis for understanding cauliflower metabolic pathways and their cross-talk under stress. Further verification of the correlative stress-responsive protein by gene expression analyses of these stressed-responsive genes, such as Rubisco, EFs, HSP100, FBPase, ADK, ATP synthase, SAM synthetase, PPR protein, GTP-binding protein lepA, Ca+2-binding protein, and ribosomal protein L11P, would facilitate our understanding of the heat- and flood-response mechanism in cauliflowers.",

Different genotypes showed differing physiological responses to combinations of stress treatments. All dynamics of the peaks were analyzed across all treatments, and a comparative analysis identified 85 stress-responsive proteins in cauliflower under short-term stressing. The majority of these stressed-responsive proteins were genotype specific. These identified proteins emerged as key participants in stress tolerance. Most of the changes in the expression levels of these proteins in response to stressing were involved in photosynthesis. \u2018H69\u2019 plants resisted high-temperature stressing by inhibiting photosynthesis and other unnecessary metabolic processes. Energy metabolism was increased and up-regulation of the expression of proteins related to cellular homeostasis, as well as those that respond to stimuli, served to maintain physiological balance during stress. Concurrently, the expression levels of proteins related to transcription, translation, and signal transduction were also up-regulated to promote survival under HF stressing. The genetic variations identified in the proteomes, plant growth, and photosynthetic performance in response to flood and heat represent stress adaption mechanisms to be exploited in future cauliflower breeding efforts.",
