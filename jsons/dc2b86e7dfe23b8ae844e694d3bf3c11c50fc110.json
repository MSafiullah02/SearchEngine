            "text": "Understanding how interurban movements can modify the spatial distribution of the population is important for transport planning but is also a fundamental ingredient for epidemic modeling. We focus here on vacation trips (for all transportation modes) during the Chinese Lunar New Year and compare the results for 2019 with the ones for 2020 where travel bans were applied for mitigating the spread of a novel coronavirus . We first show that these travel flows are broadly distributed and display both large temporal and spatial fluctuations, making their modeling very difficult. When flows are larger, they appear to be more dispersed over a larger number of origins and destinations, creating de facto hubs that can spread an epidemic at a large scale. These movements quickly induce (in about a week) a very strong population concentration in a small set of cities. We characterize quantitatively the return to the initial distribution by defining a pendular ratio which allows us to show that this dynamics is very slow and even stopped for the 2020 Lunar New Year due to travel restrictions. Travel restrictions obviously limit the spread of the diseases between different cities, but have thus the counter-effect of keeping high concentration in a small set of cities, a priori favoring intra-city spread, unless individual contacts are strongly limited. These results shed some light on how interurban movements modify the national distribution of populations, a crucial ingredient for devising effective control strategies at a national level. arXiv:2003.07276v1 [physics.soc-ph] ",

Infectious diseases spread among humans because of their interactions and movements, and the proximity of this outbreak with the Spring Festival, a period of travel with high traffic loads, provided terrible conditions for the spread of this disease. With an increasing amount of confirmed cases, more attention has been devoted to modeling the spread of COVID-19 from various aspects such as determining the value of the reproductive number [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] , of the incubation period [8] [9] [10] . In general, analytical modeling plays of course an important role in the prediction of the spread and allows in particular to test control strategies [11] , which was verified in this case too [12-20, 20, 21, 21, 22] . Particularly important were estimate of probability to export the disease in other countries [19, 23, 24] , and how effective were travel restrictions inside China [19] .",

The migration data can thus be seen as a directed, weighted network of flows between the set of n = 296 cities of China whose populations are also known (see Material and Methods). We collected the data for the Spring Festival of 2020 (from Jan. 1st to Feb. 12th, 2020) and for assessing the impact of travel bans, we also collected the data for the Spring Festival of 2019 (which according to the Chinese lunar calendar takes place from Jan. 12th to Feb. 23rd, 2019). The line is a power law fit of the form N \u2212\u03b1 with exponent \u03b1 = 2.27 with fitting method described in [26] .

This heterogeneity is confirmed in Fig. 1 (b) which shows both the average value \u00b5 d and the standard deviation \u03c3 d computed over all inter-city flows (for each day d). We see that for most days the relative dispersion \u03c3 d /\u00b5 d is of order 5 \u2212 10. This heterogeneity is probably due to the large diversity of cities that can serve as origins or destinations of flows (see below for further analysis). An important feature that we can observe on Fig. 1 (b) is the sharp drop of the standard deviation after Jan. 25th, the Lunar New Year (LNY), which we will see below is mainly due to the travel ban (see also Fig. S1 , S3 in SI for a detailed discussion).",

We show on Fig. 2 (a) the spatial dispersion \u2206 d versus time and in Fig. 2 (b) the distribution of \u2206 ij . We observe that the spatial dispersion is of order 8.3, while the temporal dispersion is less (mainly concentrated around 1). The main reason for heterogeneity thus lies in the flow fluctuations between different origins and destinations, while temporal fluctuations are smaller but not negligible. These two sources of heterogeneity clearly represent a challenge for modeling these flows, especially with very simplified models.",

The reason may be that after the outbreak of COVID-19, almost all regions have deferred the time of resuming works and classes after the Spring Festival holiday. For example, Shanghai proposed that companies not crucial to the nation should not resume works before Feb. 10th and that schools should provide online classes. At this point, the population structure at the national level is far from being back to normal.

At large times d f , we expect that R 1 since most of the in- dividuals have come back. We divide cities into three categories according to the value of R(i, 1): If the value is larger than 1.5, we classify city i as a 'receiver' city.

We represent on Fig. 5 the cities of different types on the map of China. We observe that both receiver and transit cities are homogeneously distributed in China. In constrat emitters cities are in general located in developed regions, e.g., Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and so on, as shown in figures 5 (a) and (b). It is interesting to note that cities of the Hubei province (within the dashed circle in the figure) are emitters cities in 2020, essentially due to travel restrictions that prevented individuals to come back to Wuhan. This is an important difference compared to the year of 2019 that appears here in the spatial structure of emitters and receivers.

Such a large heterogeneity could be induced by both the Spring Festival and the travel ban. Similar results apply also to an aggregated level, i.e. the incoming and outgoing flows for cities also display important heterogeneities. This aspect is crucial for understanding and modeling epidemic spreading for which we know the importance of heterogeneity for epidemic spreading on networks [28, 29] and more generally for most processes [30] . We also quantify the dispersion of origins/destinations of the incoming/outgoing flows showing that for larger flows we have a larger variety of origins and destinations. We also show that during these seasonal migrations of the Spring Festival, the national structure of population changes quickly with a larger concentration in a small set of cities. This concentration decays normally in time after the festivities but travel bans slow down this return to the initial state. It is natural to try to stop the geographical spread of the disease by stopping interurban movements, but on the other hand, large concentration in cities can favor the spread at the city level and increase the number of infected cases. This concentration can be compensated by a more important control at the individual contact level which is what was done in cities such as Wuhan. These results are in line with epidemic modeling results [19] , where it was shown that travel quarantine is effective only when combined with a large reduction of intracommunity transmission. Our results thus highlight the importance of mobility studies for modeling a variety of processes and in particular for understanding and modeling the spread of epidemics. Effective mitigating strategies need to take into account the change of population structure that we exhibited here.",

In both cases we see an important increase of the Gini coefficient in a short time (about a week): when the LNY is approaching, people go back from workplaces to hometowns for reunion with families. A smaller set of cities concentrates these meetings with the number of important cities reaching its minimum and the Gini index reaching its peak on the LNY. Based on the Gini index, we can estimate the number of 'important' cities where the concentration takes place through [n(1 \u2212 G)], where [\u00b7] denotes the integer part (see SI for details where we show in Fig. S6 this number versus time and we indeed observe an important drop when approaching the LNY).",
