In the early 1970s, Kapikian focused on this approach to the search for the elusive viruses believed to be responsible for nonbacterial gastroenteritis. It was not long before he identified the virions of the so-called Norwalk agent in a diarrheal stool from an adult volunteer who had been challenged with a fecal sample from a child ill during an outbreak of diarrhea. This virus and its soon-to-be-discovered close relatives (the so-called Norwalk-like viruses [NLVs]) proved to be important causes of explosive outbreaks of diarrhea in both children and adults.",

Only a year later, Ruth Bishop and her colleagues (1973) found virions of a different size and appearance in cells of the duodenal mucosa of infants with gastroenteritis. These agents proved to be the prototype for a new genus, the rotaviruses (RVs), members of which are infectious for humans and a wide variety of domestic animals. Rotaviruses, classified into Group A, are now recognized to be the major cause of severe diarrheal disease in infants and young children worldwide.",

Morbidity is universal, and the resulting mortality, particularly in developing areas of the world, continues to be tragic. Overall, as many as a third of the deaths in children under the age of 5 in the less-developed countries of the world are attributed to diarrhea. When pathogenic bacteria are excluded, roughly 80% of the episodes of diarrhea (>3 nonsolid stools per day) are either of unknown etiology or are due to viruses.",

            "text": "With the discovery of the enteroviruses (see Chapter 1) and the demonstration of their chronic presence in the stools of many of those who are infected, it was thought that the search for the cause of nonbacterial diarrhea would soon be over. But despite the presence of high concentrations of enteroviruses in the stools of both ill and healthy children, it shortly became apparent that these viruses were not common etiologic agents of enteritis, but merely nonpathogenic \u201cpassengers\u201d in our digestive tracts. Other viruses such as members of many of the common serotypes of the adenoviruses similarly can often be found in the gut, but they too usually fail to cause disease. As an outgrowth of an enormous amount of laboratory work, it was ultimately concluded that the elusive viruses of childhood enteritis are sufficiently fastidious that they cannot be easily grown in tissue culture and in laboratory animals. Thus, in the early 1970s, investigators initiated attempts to identify viral particles in stool extracts using electron microscopy. To accomplish this, the background was stained (so-called negative staining), with the virions in startling contrast, that is, like stars in a dark sky. Should the virions be present in sufficient number, and should their morphology be sufficiently distinctive, infection could be established. By adding specific antibody (or serum from a previously infected patient) to the suspension, the virions would clump with the antibody and an antigenic identification of the virus accomplished. This also proved a means for assaying the relative concentration of antibody in the blood of those who were infected. The technique of negative-staining electron microscopy using clinical enteric specimens is an arduous art form that requires exceptional skill and attention to detail, clearly not a characteristic of many of our species. But, this painstaking approach has now yielded evidence to indicate that viruses of at least six families may contribute to enteric illness in children and in adult citizens whose immunity has waned (Figure 32.1\n, Table 32.1\n). Studies in domestic animals have also shown that diarrheal disease of economic importance is caused by members of these same virus families, possibly by strains of virus that are host-specific. With the development of refined molecular and immunological tools, more sensitive and less laborious diagnostic approaches fortunately are now replacing negative-staining electron microscopy of stool specimens.",

The etiological role of these viruses as a cause of intestinal disease was established by demonstrating a temporal association of naturally occurring infections (as demonstrated by stool examination using electron microscopy) with illness and by experimental induction of disease in both human volunteers and experimental animals (Hall et al., 1984). The NLVs are provisionally divided for classification purposes into two distinct groups based on genetic analysis (Table 32.2\n). The relative clinical importance of the viruses of the various groups listed in Table 32.2 has yet to be established, but they are believed to be responsible for a substantial proportion of the nonbacterial outbreaks of acute vomiting and diarrhea that occur in families and institutions.",

Unfortunately, biopsy material from these experimental subjects is, by necessity, limited; thus, the extent and distribution of lesions in the digestive tract is unknown. Of obvious significance is the reduction in the height of the intestinal villi, accompanied by blunting of the villi and evidence of crypt hypertrophy. The individual lining cells of the small intestine exhibit vacuolization of the cytoplasm with loss of polarity. These findings indicate a marked increase in enterocyte replacement as documented by mitotic counts in the epithelium of the crypts. Although cell infiltrates are found in the lamina propria and the core of the villi, inflammation is customarily not a prominent feature of the lesion. Ultrastructurally, the mucosal cells remain intact, but intercellular edema is prominent and the microvilli of the brush border are significantly shortened as shown by electron microscopy. Dilatation of both the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria of the mucosal cells is seen, and endocytotic vesicles are evident. Ultrastructural studies thus far have not defined the cell site of replication of the virus, most probably because the virions are relatively small, that is, in a size range that would not readily allow one to distinguish them from ribosomes.",

However, fewer than a third of these infections were symptomatic (Wenman et al., 1979). In developing countries and in persons residing under poor socioeconomic conditions, as many as 30% of children are infected by 6 months of age (Moulton et al., 1998), and many infants experience their first encounter with RVs in the newborn nursery during the first week of life (Bishop, 1994). This high prevalence of infection during early life doubtlessly represents both the common occurrence of RV infections in persons residing in these environments (thus facilitating person-to-person spread) and the lack of acquired secretory IgA to the virus in the gut.",

There was blunting of villi, along with an increase in crypt depth and flattening of the epithelial cells lining the villi. Inflammatory cells were present in the lamina propria in 2 of the 17 infants studied. The pathological changes were said to resemble those seen in celiac disease with loss of villi, prominent crypt hypertrophy, and an infiltrate of inflammatory cells. RV particles were found in the enterocytes of these patients by electron microscopy. Histochemical evaluation of the gut mucosa\nshowed that disaccharidase concentrations were reduced in the epithelium. Repeat biopsies were done on several children during convalescence (3 to 8 weeks), and regeneration of the mucosa was found.",

To a large extent, the changes observed in children (Davidson and Barnes, 1979) were found in these animals. In calves, the lesions tended to be more prominent in the proximal small intestine, whereas in lambs the distal ileum was more severely affected. Table 32.6\nsummarizes the results of immunohistochemical studies that document viral replication in the gut of lambs after experimental infection per os. In general, the sites of RV replication correlate with the pathological changes found in the intestinal mucosa (Snodgrass et al., 1977). As might be expected, the concentrations of virus in the gut of these piglets were highest before lesions in the mucosa appeared (Crouch and Woode, 1978).",

At present, relatively few clinical studies have addressed these issues in detail. Involvement of the upper intestinal tract (duodenum and jejunum) may account for the vomiting that so frequently occurs in NLV infections. Diarrheal disease no doubt is consequent to the profound changes in the intestinal mucosa that occur during the acute illness. Reduction in the surface area of the gut mucosa and functional alterations in the individual enterocytes that line villi reduce absorption of fluids and solids beyond the capacity of the colon to compensate. The loss of disaccharidases in the mucosal cells of the small intestine increases the carbohydrate concentrations of the large bowel content, resulting in the generation of fermentation products.",
