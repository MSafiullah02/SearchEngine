Droplet transmission is defined as the transmission of diseases by expelled particles that have a propensity to settle quickly to the ground, usually within 1 m of the site of generation, due to their size.10, 11, 12 Thus, infection by droplet transmission is reliant on close proximity between infected and susceptible hosts and direct contact between the droplet carrying the infectious agent and the respiratory tract of a susceptible host. Settled droplets may also facilitate fomite transmission of infection.13, 14 Conversely, airborne transmission is defined as the transmission of infection by expelled particles that are comparatively smaller in size. These particles can remain suspended in the air for prolonged periods and thereby potentially expose a greater number of susceptible individuals to possible infection at a greater distance from the source.12, 15, 16, 17 This paradigm between droplet and airborne transmission has been underpinned by early studies by Wells, who described the settling of expelled particles as being a function of size, time and evaporation,10 and by Hamburger and Robertson, whom described the distance travelled by particles expelled during sneezing and coughing events as a function of time.18\n",

There are also physiological concerns which warrant a better understanding of the role of particle size in disease transmission. Deposition models have concluded that particles <10 \u03bcm in diameter are more likely to penetrate deeper into the respiratory tract while particles \u226510 \u03bcm in diameter are more likely to impact onto the surfaces of the upper airways and are less likely to penetrate into the lower pulmonary region.21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 Although small particles may also deposit in the upper airways,26, 30, 31 the usual behaviour is for small particles to travel with the inhaled air current and avoid impaction within the nasal region; this enables deposition lower in the respiratory tract23, 32 and the establishment of infection in this region.26 Similar reasoning is also used by Nicas (2005), who used an equilibrium size of 10 \u03bcm in diameter in risk calculations of airborne transmission.29 Based upon the likelihood of deposition in the respiratory tract rather than generated particle size, Weber and Stilianakis, in their review article, suggest a cut-off of 10 \u03bcm in diameter to separate particles likely to transmit disease (particles \u226410 \u03bcm in diameter) from those that are less likely (particles >10 \u03bcm in diameter).33 This group also used this cut-off in recent computer models and proposed likely predominant airborne transmission of particles \u226410 \u03bcm in sustained disease outbreaks and likely predominant droplet transmission in short-term epidemic outbreaks.34 Other factors, such as infectious dose at different sites, are also implicated in the establishment of infection in the respiratory tract and have been reviewed elsewhere.35Compared with upper respiratory tract infections, lower respiratory tract infections are associated with increased severity, morbidity and fatality36, 37, 38 due to the possibility of causing impairment of lung function,39, 40 the initiation of other chronic respiratory illness41, 42, 43, 44 and the effects of comorbid factors.39, 45, 46, 47 Better understanding of the site of deposition of infected particles, the relationship between particle size and pathogen load and the critical pathogen load of particles required for the establishment of infection in the different regions of the airways is necessary before particle size can be robustly established as an index of transmissibility for infection control measures.",

Recently respiratory viruses have been detected in particles during tidal breathing \u2013 an activity that is continuous but previously assumed to produce a low number of particles.48, 49, 50, 51 Other studies suggest that vibration of the vocal chords and vocalisation (associated with intermittent activities such as coughing, sneezing and talking) contributes more to particle atomization9, 52, 53 and the production of particles that carry microorganisms.54 Disease propagation may also be associated with the frequency of the different respiratory activity. While sneezing may produce more particles containing virus than coughing,15, 22, 55, 56 Couch et al. (1966) found that coughing is more frequent than sneezing during infection with Coxsackievirus A, \u2013 implying that coughing is the more efficient method of transmission for this infection.57 It can be speculated that since coughing is one of the most common clinical symptoms associated with influenza infections,58, 59 coughing may also drive the aerosolised spread of this infection. While limited cough frequency data is available, evidence from modelling of flow dynamics also lends support to such speculation60 as does the observations of sneezing counter-indicating an influenza diagnosis.61\n",

            "text": "The site of infection should also be considered in terms of understanding the source of aerosolised particles. As a starting proposition, to ensure expelled particles carry pathogen, the site of infection should be the same or very close to the site of particle generation. As earlier discussed, coughing and speech are reported to produce particles from vibrations of vocal chords.9 This implies that infection of the larynx is the optimal location for propagation of pathogen by these activities. Particle generation during breathing has recently been associated with opening of the small airways,4, 5, 6 indicating that infection of the lower respiratory tract is important for aerosolised transmission from breathing. If particle generation occurs outside of the site of infection, we speculate that there is a reduced likelihood that particles will contain a sufficient pathogen load to establish secondary infection. If multiple sites are infected, the number of particles carrying pathogen will be increased if simultaneous respiratory events occurs (for example simultaneous coughing and breathing); conversely, dilution of the number of particles carrying pathogen will occur if simultaneous atomization occurs at additional but non-infected sites. An example of this dilution is the observation that the majority of particles produced during sneezing arise from the mouth2 despite sneezing being a reflex of the irritation of the nasal region and generating particles from the lower respiratory tract with additional secretions from the nasal region.62, 63, 64 The relative proportions of particles that arise from the different areas of the respiratory tract during a respiratory activity and the change in these proportions during simultaneous respiratory activities, in healthy and in infected states, is poorly described in the literature and precludes further discussion of the site of infection and the site of particle generation are in disease spread.",

While it may be that many particles carry pathogen, pathogens may be inactivated due to desiccation and other environmental factors. Computer models have pointed out that aerosolised transmission dynamics are pathogen-specific, due to pathogen-specific peak shedding and inactivation rates66and that models need to include an inactivation parameter to account for pathogens that are no longer infectious.67\n",

Secondly, the size of pathogens may dictate the infectivity of particles. Large pathogens, such as bacteria and fungi, may not be able to be carried at high concentration in particles without breaking up into smaller particles soon after expulsion. In light of this, some large sized pathogens may find it difficult to establish an infection if a high concentration of pathogen is required.",

The most basic of the described impactors is the microscope slide and the paper strip. These surfaces are held close to the mouth and nose and capture expelled particles during respiratory activities. The surfaces are then examined by microscopy to measure particle size.15, 56, 69, 75 This type of impaction is inherently biased towards the collection of droplet-sized particles because of the propensity for airborne-sized particles to remain suspended in the air and not impact. More complex solid impactors, such as the sieve sampler used by Eichenwald et al.68 (and the Andersen sampler used later by Fennelly et al.70 and Wainwright et al.54) utilises the difference in inertial mass that accompanies changes in particle size to differentiate between different particle sizes. The larger particles, with increased inertial mass, impact on the earlier stages of the sampler while small particles, with less inertial mass, are able to avoid impaction and move through to the latter stages of the sampler. This method is normally used to size particles carrying bacterial and fungal pathogens on an agar surface for later cultivation. A liquid impactor, also known as a liquid impinger, operates similarly to a solid impactor in terms of relying upon inertial mass. However, instead of particles impacting onto a solid surface, liquid impingement requires particles to impact into a liquid, which is then cultivated. Often liquid impingers are accompanied by pre-impinger to initially collect the largest particles. However, as noted by Gerone et al.,56 droplet-sized particles may be difficult to collect for sizing with a sampler or impactor because of rapid settling after expulsion preventing any collection upon an impaction surface. Previous studies have identified that collection efficiency by impaction is impeded by the effects of drying, which reduces particle size beyond the limits of collection76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82 and particle bounce (particles bouncing off the impaction surface and onto non-collection surfaces).82 Physical slippage (particles slipping onto the wrong collection surface for sizing) may also reduce the accuracy of particle sizing. Impaction may be also inhibited by a small particle size which will remain aerosolised or bounce off the settling surface83, 84, 85, 86, 87 \u2013 this gives rise to a proclivity for the collection of heavier, large particles, rather than airborne-sized particles. The physical nature of impaction may cause particles to also spread, splash or finger and inevitably distort the true particle size if identified by microscopy.88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94\n",

These different output measures confound comparison of particle size.",

Yet, very few published studies, contemporary or otherwise, have attempted to make a clear association between carriage of specific pathogens and particle size.70, 97, 108 This is a limited evidence for a definitive understanding of whether pathogen is carried by a certain particle size or if carriage occurs indiscriminate of size or pathogen type. Furthermore, evident in two recent studies,54, 70 as with one of the older studies,56 is the misconception that one particle is representative of one microorganism. This may not necessarily be the case. Analogous to the cultivation of colonies of microorganisms,109 one particle may be representative of one microbe or an aggregation of microbes. Furthermore, particles generated in one respiratory event may not all be generated from the same site in the respiratory tract. While this does not afflict the delineation of particle size, it does infer that the establishment of infection may be affected by the factors of particle size, sites of atomization and pathogen load of particles.",

The Wells\u2019 evaporation curve is conceptually important for understanding particle fate however the extent and speed of evaporation may be further limited by the presence of hygroscopic salts within expelled particle.29 Since the first publication of the Well\u2019s evaporation curve, other studies have demonstrated it to be incorrect in its details, identifying a comparatively smaller critical particle size (the particle size when the time-of total evaporation equals the total time-of falling 2 m)17 and longer settling times.111, 112 Also reported by Wells is the effect of relative humidity \u2013 where particles are expected to reach equilibrium size slower at higher humidity. Nicas et al. also further comments on the role of relative humidity, indicating that it affects both the rate of evaporation and the equilibrium (final) size of the particle.29 Relative humidity may also play a role in affecting particle trajectory.113, 114, 115 In particular, increases in vertical and lateral particle movement have previously been associated with decreased relative humidity.10, 17\n",

Disease-induced changes, such as increases in mucus composition, quantity and viscosity, have also been observed,2, 117, 118 which may suggest that the increase in size is directly related to increases in mucus viscosity.

Evidence from computer models suggest airborne-sized particles are unlikely to carry pathogen66 \u2013 this is in contrast to the limited evidence from particle size measurements suggesting possible airborne carriage of both bacterial and viral pathogens.54, 70, 71, 97 Further examination of pathogen carriage needs to clarify whether carriage is a function of the particle size, the site of infection, the site of particle generation (which may be different to site of infection), the concentration of the pathogen in the mucus, changes in the nature of the mucus, the virulence of the pathogen itself. Furthermore, are the particles that carry virus similar to those that carry bacteria and fungi? These questions are of paramount significance for understanding the physiological niches pathogens occupy in the human body and during disease transmission. Research efforts needs to be directed towards examining particle ecology and determining the sites of expelled particle generation during different respiratory activities.",

Even using the conservative cut-off of 10 \u03bcm, rather than the 5 \u03bcm to define between airborne and droplet transmission, this size range indicates that particles do not exclusively disperse by airborne transmission or via droplet transmission but rather avail of both methods simultaneously. This suggestion is further supported by the simultaneous detection of both large and small particles.2, 71, 98, 99, 102 In line with these observations and logic, current dichotomous infection control precautions should be updated to include measures to contain both modes of aerosolised transmission. This may require airborne precautions to be used when at risk of any aerosolised infection, as airborne precautions are considered as a step-up from droplet precautions. Further elucidation of particle size and the dynamics of particles in disease transmission provides the opportunity for increased understanding of the ecological niches of respiratory pathogens and the development of improved measures to counter the spread of communicable respiratory diseases.",
