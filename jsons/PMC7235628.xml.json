Curvilinear probes (3-5 MHz) provide good visualization of both superficial and deep structures but have a larger footprint and may require angulation when scanning to avoid rib shadows. Phased array probes (3-4.5 MHz) can show all lung findings and have a smaller footprint, making the avoidance of rib shadows easier, but provide less adequate visualization of the pleural line. We disable features that decrease artifact production because LUS relies on interpreting artifacts. We optimize gain, focus, and depth for the structure of interest.",

The angle of insonation must be perpendicular to the pleural line. Because the contour of the chest wall may differ from the underlying pleura, techniques such as sliding and fanning are essential to ensure ultrasound beam alignment. Failing to do so may cause false positive (e.g., impression of an abnormal pleural line) or false negative (e.g., failing to see A- or B-lines) findings.

Pleural line abnormalities and impaired lung sliding are present in pneumothorax, inflammatory conditions (ARDS, pneumonia), and fibrotic disease, but absent in heart failure (Table 1\n). B-lines may be normal in dependent areas or lung fissures, but should not exceed 2 per intercostal space. B-lines in a dependent, symmetrical distribution, coupled with a smooth pleural line and bilateral simple pleural effusions, suggest heart failure. B-lines in a patchy or asymmetrical distribution with an irregular pleural line (with or without subpleural consolidations) suggest an inflammatory interstitial process, such as viral or atypical pneumonia, inflammatory lung disease, or early ARDS. Coalescent B-lines correlate with ground-glass opacities on chest CT and suggest a higher burden of disease. Bilateral dependent consolidations with associated simple pleural effusions suggest atelectasis. In contrast, unilateral consolidations (particularly if associated with dynamic air bronchograms or inflammatory B-lines) are more suggestive of an infectious process. Pulmonary embolism and obstructive lung disease typically present with a normal pleural line, normal lung sliding, and an absence of B-lines.
