To implement appropriate patient care in response to COVID-19, healthcare workers/responders must first protect themselves to ensure patient care can be delivered and second, in order to limit the spread of COVID-19 via patient, person, and other surface contaminations (Huh, 2020) .

In some cases of predicted healthcare worker/responder shortages and increases trends for overwhelming hospital capacity, current university/college medical doctors, nurses, etc. are graduating earlier than their degree timeline in an effort to deploy more healthcare workers/responders to support the individuals already in the frontlines (Harvey, 2020) .

The learning content was extended to create content specifically dedicated to nurses as what was done previously (Ros et al., 2017) . In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for ongoing J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f surgical interventions, the current tutorial was created and deployed within one week and the first eight novel tutorials were specifically designed for healthcare workers/responder taking care of COVID-19 patients. The rapid production of these tutorials comprised a step-by-step assessment to reliably ensure the learners interest. This included adding three more tutorials on how to safely approach a COVID-19 positive patient. The first tutorials were produced and captures outside of the hospital setting: J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f -\"Prone Decubitus\" (we already recorded this, but for operating room, not for an intensive care unit).",

(2017) compared learning a procedure from a FPV to learning from the opposite side (i.e., non-FPV or opposing observer perspective to mirror the person doing the task). Compared to the group that learned from the FPV, the learning from the opposite side group made up to 50% more mistakes, while reproducing the assembly of an electronic system. These results suggest that FPV learning increases the learners' skill acquisition, comprehension, and behaviors as evidenced by less errors. Further, these results may be uniquely explained by the way that mirror neurons (i.e., neural circuits that are explicitly involved in our visual monitoring of others, encode empathy, and facilitate the learning of watching others doing a task, assigning it value, and then implementing the tasks ourselves;",

This situation presents yet another fundamental question, as to what would be the value of a FPV tutorial world-wide system in contrast to a university's medical video library? J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f formats. Thus, an analogous argument can be made here with respect to medical movies compared to FPV tutorials within a pandemic directly effecting people globally. An advantage to the learning in FPV compared to medical videos is that the possibility for an immediate local download on a healthcare workers'/responders' smart phone can be accessed at any time in realtime prior to, during, or after patient care interactions. Also, if it is downloaded on the users smartphone it can then be accessed and viewed at any time irrespective of network signal or service issues. Since the FPV tutorial is edited, it permits the healthcare worker/responder with the possibility to self-navigate through or to skip to chapters/modules of most relevance to them. This feature has been shown to have a distinct pedagogical value (Zhang et al., 2006) as healthcare workers/responders can easily browse the necessary information, thereby increasing efficiency of patient care services. The survey results showed that the tutorials offered a better understanding of the procedures the healthcare workers/responders were to complete, thereby making them more confident and feeling ready to face the situations to care for COVID-19",

Further, the information allows the healthcare worker/responder a wide range of flexibility to initial learn, relearn, and review the material as needed to help as a powerful and rapid transferable medical intervention. There may be limitations to this technology as not all countries and hospitals may employ the same procedures, which have to be taken into consideration.

Moreover, these tutorials have been translated from French and the voice-over recording has begun in English, as a universal language, to be deployed in many other countries. In closing, it is better to be ready to face an emergency and to have this material already available, but in case of a change of the evolving recommendations, concerns for re-infection of or resurgence of COVID-19, the current tutorials were designed and deployed to offer efficient, effective, and rapid responsible global public health educational outreach technology tool direct towards alleviate the overwhelming experiences that hospitals, healthcare workers/responders, and patients face due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
