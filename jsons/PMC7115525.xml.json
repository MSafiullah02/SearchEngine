SARS has infected more than 8400 patients in about 7 months in over 30 countries and caused more than 800 deaths. However, no SARS vaccine is currently available for clinical use. Therefore, we have developed novel vaccine candidates against SARS CoV using cDNA constructs encoding the structural antigens; S, M, E, or N protein. In immunized mice, neutralizing antibodies against the virus and T cell immunity against virus-infected-cells were studied, since these immunities play important roles in protection against SARS CoV and many virus infections. In particular, CD8+ CTL plays an important role in T cell immunity dependent protection against virus infections and the eradication of murine and human cancers [4], [5]. In the present study, the SCID-PBL/hu model, which is capable of analyzing in vivo human immune response, was used because it is a more relevant translational model for human cases [4]. These vaccines induce neutralizing antibody and CTL. This is the first report inducing antibody against SARS M. Theses vaccines should provide useful tool for development of protective vaccines in human.",

Neutralizing antibodies against SARS CoV in the serum from the mice were assayed by use of Vero-E6 cell. CTL activity against SARS CoV was studied using human cells, expressing SARS antigens. CTL activity of human CD8-positive lymphocytes in the spleen from SCID-PBL/hu was assessed using 51Cr-release assay [5], [6]. Human monoclonal antibodies were produced from B cell hybridoma using P3U1 myeloma cell and spleen cells from human immunoglobulin transchromosomic mice (KM mice) [7].",

Furthermore, SARS M DNA as well as SARSS DNA vaccine induce human neutralizing antibodies against SARS CoV by the SCID-PBL/hu model. Antibody against SARS M antigen exerted high inhibitory activity against cytopathic effect by SARS CoV. It was reported that monoclonal antibodies against external domain of M neutralize murine hepatitis corona virus, but only in the presence of complement, and both E and M proteins are required for budding of virions [10]. Neutralizing antibody activity against M protein was not at all eliminated by the inactivation of complement. Antibody against M protein might inhibit the growth of SARS CoV in the cells. Therefore, the effect of combination immunization with such SARS vaccines (M vaccine and S vaccine) and the specificity of human monoclonal neutralizing antibodies are now being studied. These vaccines are expected to provide useful tool for development of therapeutic vaccines.",
