The majority of cases were identified in the south and east of China [1, 12]. Almost all infected individuals were hospitalised, and 36 % (158/444) died [12]. The fatality rate was much higher than that observed for seasonal influenza in the United States (\u223c0.04 %) [12] and a previous H7N7 outbreak, but it was lower than that of H5N1 (70.0 %) in China [2]. Numerous studies have indicated that the higher mortality rate is related to delays in diagnosis and antiviral intervention, as well as old age and chronic diseases [17, 19].",

            "text": "Accumulating evidence has indicated that the infection source of H7N9 was presumably poultry and related products; however, human-to-human transmission was implicated in 20.0 % of confirmed cases [3, 10, 21, 26, 36, 38]. Nonetheless, evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission is very limited. Gene sequencing, receptor-binding-site (RBS) binding assays, and a series of animal studies have revealed that the H7N9 virus has an increased capacity to bind to mammalian respiratory cells. For example, substitutions in the HA at amino acid residues Q226L and G186V, and mutations in PA, PB1 and PB2 (D701N and E627K) are associated with higher virus replication rates, severity of illness and transmissibility [4, 23, 39, 44]. In accordance with this, Wang et al. reported that PB2 E627K mutation slightly increased the case fatality rate [33]. Additional studies by Hai et al. and Sleeman et al. showed that that the emergence of the Arg292Lys mutation in the neuraminidase (NA) gene appears to be associated with failure of response to NA inhibitors and to adverse clinical outcomes [9, 29]. A further important study indicated that H7N9 and H9N2 viruses are co-circulating in some live-bird markets, which might alter host adaptation and virus pathogenicity [14]. This raises concerns regarding the potential for H7N9 to adapt and lead to an infection pandemic.",

The risk factors that might contribute to a fatal outcome regarding human H7N9 infection include old age, a history of smoking, chronic lung disease, immunosuppressive disorders, chronic drug use, and delayed oseltamivir intervention [19]. The present study described the major differences in epidemiological and viral features between mild, severe and fatal cases during the three epidemic waves of the worldwide H7N9 outbreak. The age and gender characteristics of H7N9 cases are unusual compared to those of H5N1 cases. In H5N1, an average age of 26 years (interquartile range: 19\u201325) and a more equal gender distribution were the prominent features [12]. However, the present study indicated that the average age in the mild group (27.6 years) was far younger than that in the severe (52 years) and fatal groups (62 years) [2, 32], with 50 % of mild cases being found in children <10 years of age. However, the gender distribution has no statistical difference among three groups.",

For the HA segment, the H7N9 hemagglutinin outer-surface proteins, from all isolates of the three clinical groups lacked a multi-basic cleavage site. Despite the severity of symptoms and fatality rate in human infections, the absence of the multi-basic cleavage site in HA indicates that H7N9 would be considered an LPAI virus [30]. Analysis of the protein sequence of the H7N9 viruses infecting humans showed substitutions in the HA at amino acid residues Q226L and G186V. These substitutions have been associated with increased affinity for \u03b1-2,6-linked sialic acid receptors, indicating that the virus may adapt more rapidly to infect mammals via an enhanced capacity for mutations [4, 18]. The increased binding affinity of H7N9 compared to that of H5N1, raises concerns regarding a potential adaptation of the virus that would allow it to cause a pandemic [12]. R57K, related to the antigenic site E, and N276D, related to the antigenic site C, were the most frequently observed mutations in mild cases, but R57M, related to the antigenic site E, was the major mutation in severe cases. Interestingly, the present study is the first report of the occurrence of the novel mutations L168I and E114K, near the antibody accessible site. These new mutations were detected in isolates from mild cases; however, their significance remains unclear.",

Genomic sequencing of H7N9 isolates indicated that the substitution E627K in PB2 was more frequent in the fatal group than in the severe and mild groups, whereas N559T was found in the mild group. The PB2 amino acid change increases virulence and enhances polymerase activity in mice [16]. This, along with other factors, likely contributes to the increased severity of the disease in humans with H7N9 infection. The PB2 from H7N9 isolates from birds retained Glu at position 627 and Asp at 701, strongly suggesting that the mutation is positively selected upon replication in the human host, as reported previously for zoonotic A (H7N7) and A(H5N1) infections [1]. For PA, over 90 % of fatal cases have V100A and K356R mutations, which were present in species-associated signature positions. Interestingly, the PA-356R signature is associated with increased H5N1virulence [37]. Additional markers of adaptation to non-avian hosts or virulence were noted in the PB1-F2 gene, where 90.3 % of fatal isolates showed the 90 amino acid mutations in the PB1 gene \u2013 higher than that of non-human isolates and the mild and severe cases.

Phylogenetic analysis indicated that a total of six genotypes were circulating in human cases worldwide, but no difference in distribution of genotypes was observed among the three clinical groups in the present study [24, 42]. In the first epidemic wave of 2013, genotype A was detected in all Chinese areas, with the exception of the Pearl River areas (Guangdong Province and Hong Kong), particularly in the Yangtze River delta, including Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shandong, Fujian and Anhui Provinces, as well as Shanghai. These findings support the hypothesis that H7N9 infection originated from this area. Furthermore, some external and internal genes exchanged and generated F genotypes in these areas in the second and third epidemic waves. In contrast, genotypes B, C and E were predominant in the Pearl River (Guangdong Province and Hong Kong) in the first, second and third epidemic waves, which might indicate that other subtypes were circulating in the human and poultry populations. The infectivity, transmissibility and pathogenicity of the different genotypes has not yet been characterised. New genotypes with higher fitness may be generated by genetic tuning in the future [33, 45].",

Furthermore, PB2 (E627K), NA(R294K) and PA (V100A) mutations were slightly associated with an increased fatality rate. However, HA (N276D) and PB2 (N559T) were obviously related to a mild outcome. Although H7N9 isolates from all over the world presented with a variety of genotypes, there were no sequence differences in the mild, severe and fatal cases. However, there was an obvious difference in the distribution of genotypes in the regions of the Pearl and Yangtze rivers and between the three different epidemic waves. There was also evidence to suggest that genetic tuning not only mediated species switching but may also have allowed the virus to increase its adaptation to more efficiently infect humans and enable person-to-person transmission [28, 43]. However, the mechanism driving genetic tuning has not yet been fully elucidated, and no vaccine for the prevention of influenza A (H7N9) virus infection is available to date. Thus, an effective avian influenza surveillance network for discovering new infections and monitoring any genetic changes and potential adaptations in the H7N9 virus at the early stages is essential. Canada recently reported two confirmed family cases of influenza A (H7N9), imported from China. This showed that it is possible to transfer the H7N9 virus from China to the rest of the world via travel and transportation [35]. Close cooperation between the different sectors related to human health, poultry and wild birds is necessary to respond to the potential pandemic risk posed by the novel avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses [8].",
