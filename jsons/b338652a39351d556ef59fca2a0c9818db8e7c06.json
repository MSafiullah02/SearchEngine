Proteins do not act alone; instead, they rely on complex interactions with other proteins and molecules to propagate signals leading to specific cellular responses. Given the breadth of protein species, highthroughput methods are essential to gain a comprehensive understanding of the proteome. A popular, high-throughput technology for studying the proteome is the protein microarray. Simply defined, protein microarrays are microscopic tools that display hundreds to thousands of different proteins on a fixed substrate in a high-density array format, which can then be queried and analyzed simultaneously [3] [4] [5] [6] . Protein microarrays can be distinguished from other protein display methods, such as yeast and phage display, because the identity of the protein and its associated array address are known in advance. Protein microarrays have helped tackle routine challenges in other proteomics technologies, including low protein abundance, complicated assay procedures, difficulty in modulating assay environment, low sensitivity, and lowthroughput analysis of proteins [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 191, "end": 194, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 195, "end": 197, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 808, "end": 811, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 812, "end": 815, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 816, "end": 819, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 820, "end": 823, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1282, "end": 1285, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1286, "end": 1289, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1290, "end": 1293, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1294, "end": 1297, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1298, "end": 1302, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1303, "end": 1307, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1308, "end": 1312, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1313, "end": 1317, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1318, "end": 1322, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1323, "end": 1327, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In addition to basic research, protein microarrays have become useful in translational research, which aims to \"translate\" findings in fundamental research into clinical practice and meaningful health outcomes.

In order to achieve adequate statistical power during biomarker discovery and validation, the analyses of tens to hundreds of different clinical samples are often required due to high biological variation among patients. The expense associated with analyzing so many samples was, in part, responsible for the modest adoption of protein microarrays in translational research. For example, the production and purification of thousands of different proteins is much more complex than producing DNA oligonucleotides for a gene microarray. In addition, protein microarrays must achieve very tight tolerances and high reproducibility both within and between batches in order to discern subtle differences across clinical samples.

These arrays have been referred to as purified, natural, and cell-free expression protein microarrays (Fig. 1 , Table 1 ). The most popular microarray format is the \"purified protein microarray\" in which proteins are expressed in heterologous systems, such as insect cells, Escherichia coli, or yeast. The proteins are purified in a 96-well plate format via a fusion tag, and subsequently printed on the slide. The purified protein microarray was originally used to build the yeast proteome microarray containing 5800 ORFs, and has since been employed in various protein function and antibody biomarker discovery studies [12] . Currently, the most comprehensive purified protein array is the HuProt TM human proteome microarray v2.0 manufactured by Arrayit Corporation and CDI Laboratories. The array has 19 394 proteins with 15 275 different genes, covering \u00df75% of the human genome and representing different splicing isoforms. However, there are some disadvantages to the purified protein microarray approach; these include: (i) the expense and time requirement for the expression and purification of thousands of proteins, (ii) the challenge of expressing and purifying large proteins (>50 kDa) and membrane proteins, (iii) the short shelf life [25] , and (iv) the possibility of incorrect protein folding and activity if the proteins are expressed in a different host milieu (e.g. human proteins expressed in E. coli) or dried following array production. Unlike the purified protein array that employs heterologous systems to produce protein, \"natural protein microarrays\" (NPMs) are printed using human cell lysate, tissue lysate, or bodily fluids (e.g. serum) containing naturally expressed proteins that likely have the same folding, activity, and PTMs as those in vivo at the time of sample collection. The proteins can be printed as a complete lysate, fractionated using multidimensional liquid-based separation techniques, or captured to the array surface with specific antibodies. The translational applications differ depending on the fractionation state of the lysate and how the proteins are captured to slide. NPMs with fractionated samples are often probed with serum, and have been used to study the immune response to various cancers and their altered antigens (i.e. phosphorylated and glycosylated proteins) [26] . The antibody target must then be subsequently identified, which is often done with mass spectrometry. Sample fractionation can also assist in the analyses of specific protein classes, for example, membrane or glycosylated proteins [26] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 809, "end": 813, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1437, "end": 1441, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2516, "end": 2520, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2754, "end": 2758, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 290, "end": 297, "text": "(Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 300, "end": 307, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Protein microarray technology"}, {"text": "Unfractionated NPMs are also known as \"reverse phase protein arrays\" (RPPA), \"lysate arrays,\" or \"reverse phase lysate arrays.\" These lysate arrays are probed with antibodies that recognize key signaling proteins or their modified forms to help determine how specific signaling pathways are (dys) regulated during disease and infection, and may indicate potential therapeutic options. Moreover, numerous patients and control samples can be analyzed simultaneously with RP-PAs [5] . A primary advantage of RPPAs is that they are able to discern the dynamic posttranslational events (e.g. PTMs) that can greatly affect protein interactions within complex signaling networks, information of which cannot be determined by analyzing gene expression and protein levels alone.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 476, "end": 479, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Protein microarray technology"}, {"text": "Alternatively, \"reverse-capture protein arrays\" (RCPAs) are coated with antibodies that will capture proteins expressed in vivo (e.g. tumor antigens), which are then used to probe for autoantibodies in serological samples.

Disadvantages of fractionated, unfractionated (RPPAs), and captured (RCPAs) NPMs include: (i) their reliance on high-quality antibodies specific to the pathway(s)of-interest, which may not be available; (ii) low-abundance target proteins may be difficult to detect; and (iii) proteins may lose their activity during purification, printing, and storage.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 360, "end": 364, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 365, "end": 368, "text": "27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Protein microarray technology"}, {"text": "\"Cell-free protein microarrays\" were developed to avoid challenges related to protein capture and purification for array production, as described in this section. Therefore, cellfree protein microarrays use PCR-generated DNA fragments or plasmid cDNA to express proteins in a cell-free expression system that transcribes and translates the genes-of-interest [28] . Various expression systems are commercially available, including lysate from E. coli, wheat germ, insect cells, rabbit reticulocyte, and human cells. Cell-free protein microarrays include the protein in situ array [29] , DNA array to protein array [30] , nucleic acid programmable protein array (NAPPA) [13, 31, 32] , in situ puromycin-capture array [33] , and the \"unpurified\" protein array developed by Davies et al. [34] . Following in vitro transcription and translation that typically require 2-5 h, the expressed proteins are captured in situ by a capture antibody or molecule. The \"unpurified\" cell-free microarray does not use any capturing agent; instead, the lysate containing the expressed protein-of-interest is spotted directly onto a nitrocellulose substrate, with the assumption that the coprinted lysate will have a similar background from feature to feature. Unpurified cell-free protein microarrays have been successfully applied in immune profiling and antibody biomarker discovery for infectious diseases [9, [34] [35] [36] [37] . In addition to the aforementioned applications, NAPPA has also been used to study protein-protein interactions and PTMs [13, 19, 38, 39] . There are many advantages of using the cell-free expression approach, including the ability to express proteins in the appropriate expression milieu at the time of the experiment. The cell lysate, which includes chaperone proteins, also allows the proteins-of-interest to be expressed, folded, and maintained in physiologically compatible buffers from the time of translation through the experiment, thus significantly reducing the likelihood of unfolding, denaturing, or drying. Cell-free expression arrays are cost-effective because they do not require protein purification, and the printing of DNA (i.e. DNA array to protein array, NAPPA) results in a more stable array with a longer shelf life than proteinbased microarrays. These arrays can be easily made high throughput, with thousands of different proteins displayed on a standard-sized microscope slide (i.e. 75 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 1.2 mm 3 ). For example, NAPPA uses a routine density of \u00df2300 proteins per slide, which has been increased to 8000 with the use of nanowells [40, 41] . Finally, immune responses in disease may recognize both linear and conformation epitopes. Thus, biomarker screening using proteins that are both folded and denatured is likely to have the value of displaying both types of epitopes. NAPPA is amenable to studying both folded and denatured proteins, making it possible to identify autoantibody biomarkers to epitopes that would otherwise be buried during healthy homeostasis [42] [43] [44] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 358, "end": 362, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 579, "end": 583, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 613, "end": 617, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 668, "end": 672, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 673, "end": 676, "text": "31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 677, "end": 680, "text": "32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 715, "end": 719, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 784, "end": 788, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1390, "end": 1393, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1394, "end": 1398, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1399, "end": 1403, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1404, "end": 1408, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1409, "end": 1413, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1536, "end": 1540, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1541, "end": 1544, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1545, "end": 1548, "text": "38,", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1549, "end": 1552, "text": "39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2575, "end": 2579, "text": "[40,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2580, "end": 2583, "text": "41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 3009, "end": 3013, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 3014, "end": 3018, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 3019, "end": 3023, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Protein microarray technology"}, {"text": "There are also disadvantages to the cell-free approach.

For the other types of cell-free microarrays, nonspecific binding of components in the cell-free expression system to the array matrix may occur; however, these nonspecific interactions are largely removed during several washing steps, leaving behind lysate components that are at a level much lower than that of the protein-of-interest and are consistent across features.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 428, "end": 432, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Protein microarray technology"}, {"text": "A bigger theoretical concern is that lysate proteins, which are also human, may interact specifically with some captured proteins-of-interest and be displayed as protein complexes.

They are particularly useful when the number of proteinsof-interest is modest and the number of clinical specimens is high (Fig. 2) [14, 46] ; however, more recent advances in this approach are enabling the analyses of greater numbers of proteins [47] . In bead-based microarrays, the address of the target protein is embedded in the colors of their specifically bound beads. With Luminex xMAP R technology, each bead is barcoded using two fluorescent dyes that are mixed in an appropriate ratio; up to 500 different color beads are available. More colored beads (n = 1725) with a combination of four fluorescent dyes have also been developed for higher throughput analyses [47] . As an example, antigensof-interest on different color-coated beads are incubated with serological samples. Captured antibodies from the serological samples are then bound by a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody. Two readings will take place during analyses: (i) the bead color will identify its associated antigen and (ii) the fluorescence from the secondary antibody will indicate the abundance of serological antibodies specifically bound to the antigen. The merits of the bead-based assay include high sensitivity, wide dynamic range, excellent reproducibility, and ease of automation.

Additional studies using an independent sample cohort(s) are warranted to validate these potential autoantibodies of SLE.
