            "text": "In spite of difficulties, shrimp production is an important and profitable food producing industry. Even though, in many countries cultured shrimp production has been severely hindered by various viral diseases i.e., white spot syndrome \u2014 WSSV (Inouye et al., 1994, Rosenberry, 2001). First signs of this disease, such as sudden reduction in food consumption and red discoloration, are followed by a sharp increase in mortality in shrimp farms over the next 3\u201310 days, even reaching 100% mortality (Peinado-Guevara and L\u00f3pez-Meyer, 2006). First description of WSSV appears to have been from an outbreak in Taiwan in 1992 (Chen, 1995, Chou et al., 1995). This disease seems to have spread world-wide, except perhaps to Australia. It has been suggested that world weather changes have contributed to the dissemination of this disease (Sonnenholzner et al., 2002). As the name of the disease suggests, the main signs of WSSV are 0.5\u20132.0 mm white spots in the interior part of the shell, appendixes, uropods, telson, pereiopods, pleopods and cuticle of the abdominal segments (Takahashi et al., 1994). The color of shrimps becomes pale red and the lymphoid organ becomes turgid (Takahashi et al., 1994), and it has been described as hypertrophic (Vidal et al., 2001). Diseased shrimps become lethargic, and they show erratic swimming and lack of appetite and die during the next three days.",

It has been claimed that this drug preparation stimulates production of gamma interferon in human beings (Sugawara, 1986). Glycyrrhizic acid possesses antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo interfering with both DNA and RNA replications, hence interfering with replication of a wide range of viruses, including herpes, influenza A and B, hepatitis B, coronavirus, and SARS (Badam, 1994, Chen, 1995, Durand et al., 1997, Lee et al., 2007, Lin, 2003, Pompei et al., 2009). Glycyrrhizic acid has also demonstrated to be capable of impeding virion eclosion from its capside (Pompei et al., 2009), apparently due to a dose-dependant inhibition of kinase-P phosphorylation (Chavali et al., 1987). Additionally, it has been shown to interfere with arylamine N-acetyltransferase bacterial activity, hence exhibiting antibacterial effects at least vs Streptococcus spp., Haemophilus spp., and Klebsiella spp. (Krausse et al., 2004, Lo et al., 1996, Tanaka et al., 2001).",

Hence, stimulation of their immune system may be a way to increase shrimp body defense mechanisms, particularly before they face the viral challenge. Thus, considering the apparent immune-modulator and antiviral activities of glycyrrhizic acid, it was set as the aim in this study to assess this preparation for its potential protective effects in a laboratory controlled challenge with WSSV.",

It is a very virulent pathological agent and causes higher percent mortalities (Sahul Hameed et al., 2001).

Various studies on how shrimp survives to viral infections state that the individual immune processes play a key role, such as infiltration, phagocytosis and encapsulation of viruses within a given tissue (Durand et al., 1997, Momoyama et al., 1994). In shrimp, the lymphoid organ is an integral part of the circulatory system, and can act as viral-particle filter (Bell and Lightner, 1988). Pazir et al. (2011) describe intra-nuclear bodies in lymphoid organ cells of diseased shrimps (L. vannamei) diagnosed with WSSV in farms of the Persian Gulf. The lesions there described comply closely with the ones observed in this trial, including karyorrhexis in some cells in the lymphoid organ as well as basophilic inclusion bodies within the nucleus. Yet, these formation spheres also occur in at least six different viral infections on peneid shrimps (Bonami et al., 1992). Hence, this finding is hardly pathognomonic of WSSV.",
