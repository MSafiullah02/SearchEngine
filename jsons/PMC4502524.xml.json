After that time point, Nogo-B expression slowly recovered at 24 h and 48 h, but the levels were still significantly lower than those in the controls (Fig. 1B\u2013C, Figure S1A). In addition, this reduction in Nogo-B expression in response to LPS instillation at 12 h was also found in BALF cells by immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting (Fig. 1D\u2013E, Figure S1B).

LPS-induced lung injury was observed in the Ad-RFP- and Ad-Nogo-B-treated mice, manifesting as hemorrhage, the infiltration of inflammatory cells into alveoli and lung parenchyma, and alveolar wall thickening. The lung injury score was lower in the Ad-Nogo-B-treated mice compared with the Ad-RFP-treated mice (3.2 \u00b1 0.1 vs. 4.3 \u00b1 0.2, P < 0.01) (Fig. 4A). The BALF total protein concentration in the Ad-Nogo-B group was significantly lower than that in the Ad-RFP group (1032.9 \u00b1 67.47 vs. 1859.2 \u00b1 359.76 \u03bcg/ml, n = 5, P < 0.05), indicating less protein leakage in the Ad-Nogo-B-treated mice (Fig. 4B).",

The cells were then incubated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/ml) for 24 h, resulting in the further down-regulation of Nogo-B mRNA in NOGOi groups compared with the NEGi groups. The CXCL11 (J), LIF (K) and Nppa (L) mRNA levels were markedly elevated as early as 6 h, but only slight differences (<2-fold) were detected between the Nogo-B-down-regulated groups and controls during the 24 h challenge. The PTX3 mRNA level in the control cells showed a slow but significant elevation during the LPS challenge, whereas in the NOGOi-treated cells, its level was markedly down-regulated and was 14.3-fold lower than that of the controls at 24 h (L). We further assessed the candidate genes by conducting an over-expression experiment. The over-expression of Nogo-B in RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 7A\u2013D) resulted in significantly increases in the PTX3 at 6 h and 12 h compared with those in the controls (Fig. 7E). The Nppa and CXCL11 expression levels were also slightly elevated after LPS incubation (Fig. 7F\u2013G). No significant differences in expression were observed for LIF following LPS challenge (Fig. 7H).

Clinical evidence indicates that in patients with asthma13, atherosclerosis31 and aneurysms32, local Nogo-B expression is inhibited. In accordance with these results, in animal models of acute or chronic asthma1013 and vascular injury9, Nogo-B has also been found to be down-regulated.

            "text": "Balance is key to the development of ALI/ARD. Accumulating evidence indicates that AMs play a complex role in the development of this condition. Although AMs are the primary cells that recognize LPS, recruit neutrophils and initiate the cascade of inflammatory reactions34, sufficient AMs are also essential for the inhibition of excessive neutrophil accumulation and inflammatory responses. Beck et al. have reported that the depletion of AMs leads to a significant increase in leukocyte infiltration and the aggravation of lung injury35. In addition, Maus et al. have reported that blocking MCP-1 using a polyclonal antibody results in higher levels of capillary-alveolar barrier damage and myeloperoxidase in ALI rats36. Furthermore, CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)-knockout mice show the reduced recruitment of AMs and, greater neutrophil infiltration and severity of lung injury37. Because MCP-1 is a potent cytokine involved in macrophage migration and recruitment, these results suggest that sufficient MCP-1 secretion and AM recruitment are also protective factors in ALI. Therefore, the increase in the numbers of AMs induced by Nogo-B expression before LPS stimulation might be a reason for the reduced neutrophil recruitment in mice with LPS-induced ALI. Another explanation may be the elevated MCP-1 levels. In addition to being a chemotactic factor for macrophages, MCP-1 itself functions as a protective factor in ALI by promoting N2O production through the MCP-1/CCR2 pathway, as reported by Okuma et al.38. However, we did not find any difference in TNF-\u03b1 secretion following LPS challenge. TNF-\u03b1 is an early phase cytokine that reaches its peak level as early as 4 h after induction, indicating that Nogo-B may not modulate early inflammatory responses.",

            "text": "A previous study has shown that only one gene is differentially expressed between Nogo-B-deficient and wild-type mice at baseline13. In accordance with this finding, our PCA results showed that the gene profiles of the Ad-Nogo-B- and Ad-RFP-treated mice only differed after LPS induction, suggesting that Nogo-B may mainly function under stress conditions. Using microarray and PubMatrix analysis, we identified 4 genes (LIF, Nppa, CXCL11, and PTX3) that might function downstream of Nogo-B over-expression. LIF is known to inhibit leukocyte migration in LPS-induced lung inflammation, and its elevation in ALI is beneficial for the alleviation of inflammation39. CXCL11 is a cytokine for activated T cells40, which binds CXCR3 with high affinity and has the potential to restrain inflammatory autoimmunity41. Interestingly, Nppa, a peptide mainly secreted by atrial cells that plays a key role in relieving heart preload, was also among the differentially expressed genes. Its expression has been recently found to be elevated in ARDS, and administration of exogenous Nppa has been shown to successfully attenuate both gram- negative and positive bacterial infection-induced ALI4243. Although the microarray results suggested that these genes might be involved in Nogo-B-related protection in ALI, in vitro studies did not show clear trends among the expression of the three above mentioned genes and the Nogo-B level.",

PTX3 is an acute-phase protein that is produced by a variety of tissue cells at the site of infection or inflammation44. Previous studies have shown that it is up-regulated in LPS- or high-volume ventilation-induced ALI murine models45. Although a high PTX3 level is accompanied by severe ALI/ARDS46, Han et al.22 have recently reported that PTX3-knockout ALI mice show elevated neutrophil infiltration and cell death and more severe lung injury after LPS induction, suggesting a protective role of PTX3 in ALI. In addition, PTX3 can bind P-selectin and attenuate neutrophil recruitment at sites of inflammation47. Therefore, higher levels of PTX3 secretion induced by the over-expression of Nogo-B might inhibit neutrophil infiltration, thus decreasing the severity of lung injury. However, the precise mechanisms by which PTX3 is regulated by Nogo-B require further investigation.",

This discrepancy might be due to differences in the properties of the stimuli and the disease pathophysiology.
