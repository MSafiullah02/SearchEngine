The development of germ theory in the late 19th Century by Louis Pasteur alerted us to the presence of microbial pathogens and led to the development of combative measures such as antibiotics, anti-virals, asepsis and vastly improved sanitation. 1 These advancements aside, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2003 serves as a very recent reminder of the continual threat that opportunistic pathogens place on public health and society in general. At a clinical level, a practising optometrist must be informed on the epidemiology and aetiology of the various threats to prevent micro-epidemics, that is, the transmission of disease from patient to patient or between patient and practitioner in his or her practice. Given the ease with which highly transmissible diseases are spread, the considerations are far from trivial.",

Though the exact route of transmission is unclear, the experience from 2003 showed that the vast majority of HCWs who acquired the disease had close contact with infected patients. 4 Given their routine diagnostic procedures, such as ophthalmoscopy and slitlamp biomicroscopy, optometrists will invariably be in close proximity to patients in the course of their examinations.

            "text": "Patient-to-patient transmission of the disease is of concern to optometrists. One particularly significant finding from 2003 was the discovery of the coronavirus in tear samples taken from several patients testing positive for SARS. 5 This discovery, coupled with the fact that almost all of the disease transmissions in 2003 occurred through contact with bodily secretions of an infected individual, 4 highlights the particular risk tears can impose. Reusable equipment, such as applanation tonometers, trial contact lenses, trial frames, pinholes and handheld occluders potentially serve as vectors for transmission from patient to patient. The examiner's hands, often used to widen palpebral fissures or invert eyelids, are obvious vehicles for inadvertent patient inoculation. 5 In hindsight, one benefit the world medical community derived from the acute but brisk SARS epidemic is the knowledge that the current infection control measures for such highly transmissible diseases were inadequate. The lessons learned from 2003 may prove invaluable for the inevitable future emergence of a highly contagious airborne pathogen that many experts fear will become the next flu pandemic. 6",

In the past century, worldwide influenza pandemics occurred in 1918, 1957, 1968 and 1977 , with estimates of the 1918 pandemic alone suggesting upwards of 40 million casualties. 7 Most virologists concur that a future pandemic is a 'virtual certainty', whether it be from the current H5N1 strain of avian influenza that is devastating poultry stocks all over Asia and Eastern Europe or some other avian strain yet to be conceived. 8 Because of its zoological origin, humans lack antibodies to the animal-derived antigens present on the viral surface, thereby making the virus, which has now become endemic in certain countries, a leading threat to become a worldwide pandemic. 9 Whether the new pandemic strain emerges this year or in 10 years, the optometrist in practice will have to remain particularly vigilant, as occurred during the SARS outbreak, to prevent patient-topractitioner or patient-to-patient transmission. The evidence from 2003 showed that SARS was transmitted by airborne means as well as through direct contact with the secretions of an infected individual. 4 Noone can be sure of the form that the next influenza virus will take but if it too has airborne spread, it will have a similar very high risk of transmission. 7",

In the days and weeks after September 11, the public got a glimpse of what may become a face of pandemic disease delivery in the 21st Century, that is, bioweaponry, as weapons-grade anthrax circulated through the US postal system. 10 The rapid evolution of basic microbiotechnology and hence, affordability of bioweapons, makes them accessible to virtually any group intent on inflicting mass casualties. An oft quoted 1969 study by the United Nations estimated the cost per square kilometre of a large-scale military attack on civilians to be US$2,000 for conventional weapons, US$800 for nuclear weapons, US$600 for nerve gas weapons and US$1 with biological weapons (cited by Pringle 11 ). Though inflation has occurred since 1969, there has been a precipitous fall in the price of the necessary biotechnologies. Many of the appropriate biological procedures can be performed using basic high-school scientific equipment, the techniques can be retrieved in 'cook-book' format from the internet 12 and materials can be acquired inexpensively from medical supply companies. 13 The reasons for bioterror being considered a significant public health concern are clear.",

Even if an attack occurred outside our country, we might not be immune, as many diseases have long incubation periods, in the case of smallpox up to 19 days. 10 If one considers the ubiquitous presence of intercontinental flight, a disease outbreak in even a remote part of the world followed by aeroplane travel by an asymptomatic person could conceivably land that person in our office.

At the SARS epicentre of the Hong Kong outbreak during 2003, the HCWs who properly adhered to the control measures, specifically mask, gloves, gowns and hand wash-ing, were overwhelmingly less likely to be infected. Conversely, the overwhelming majority of HCWs who were infected had omitted one or more of the preventative steps, signalling the efficacy of the measures. 2",
