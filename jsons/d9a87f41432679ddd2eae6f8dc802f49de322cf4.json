            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 has a zoonotic origin and was transmitted to humans via an undetermined intermediate host, leading to infections in humans and other mammals. To enter host cells, the viral spike protein (S-protein) binds to its receptor, ACE2, and is then processed by TMPRSS2. Whilst receptor binding contributes to the viral host range, S-protein:ACE2 complexes from other animals have not been investigated widely. To predict infection risks, we modelled S-protein:ACE2 complexes from 215 vertebrate species, calculated their relative energies, correlated these energies to COVID-19 infection data, and analysed structural interactions. We predict that known mutations are more detrimental in ACE2 than TMPRSS2. Finally, we demonstrate phylogenetically that human SARS-CoV-2 strains have been isolated in animals. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can infect a broad range of mammals, but not fish, birds or reptiles. Susceptible animals could serve as reservoirs of the virus, necessitating careful ongoing animal management and surveillance.",

Available data suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has a zoonotic source 1 , with the closest sequence currently available deriving from the horseshoe bat 2 . As yet, the transmission route to humans, including the intermediate host, is unknown. So far, little work has been done to assess the animal reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2, or the potential for the virus to spread to other species living with, or in close proximity to, humans in domestic, rural, agricultural or zoological settings.",

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the betacoronavirus that caused the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak 12 , likely jumped to humans from its original bat host via civets. Viruses genetically similar to human SARS-CoV have been isolated from animals as diverse as racoon dogs, ferret-badgers 3 and pigs 13 , suggesting the existence of a large host reservoir.

The sequence of ACE2 is highly conserved across vertebrates, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 could use orthologues of ACE2 for cell entry. The structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein RBD has been solved in complex with human ACE2 24 and identification of critical binding residues in this structure have provided valuable insights into viral recognition of the host receptor [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Compared with SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein has a 10-22-fold higher affinity for human ACE2 24, 25, 29 , which is thought to be caused by three classes of mutations in the S-protein 30 . Similarly, variations in human ACE2 have also been found to increase affinity for S-protein receptor binding 31 . These factors may contribute to the host range and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2.",

In addition, sites in ACE2 have been identified as under positive selection in bats, particularly in regions involved in binding the S-protein 27 . The impacts of mutations in ACE2 orthologues have also been tested, for example structural modelling of ACE2 from 27 primate species 38 demonstrated that apes and African and Asian monkeys may also be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.

We correlated changes in the energy of the complex with changes in the structure of ACE2, chemical properties of residues in the binding interface, and experimental COVID-19 infection phenotypes from in vivo and in vitro animal studies. To further test our predictions, we performed detailed manual structural analyses, presented as a variety of case studies for different species.

Since this protocol considers mutations from animal to human, lower \u0394\u0394G values correspond to stabilisation of the animal complex relative to the human complex, and therefore higher risk of infection. To consider \u0394\u0394G values in an evolutionary context, we annotated phylogenetic trees for all 215 vertebrate species analysed ( Supplementary Fig. 8 ) and for a subset of animals that humans come into close contact with in domestic, agricultural or zoological settings (Fig. 2) .

In agricultural settings, camels, cows, sheep, goats and horses also have relatively low \u0394\u0394G values, suggesting comparable binding affinities to humans, in agreement with experimental data(20) (Supplementary Table 6 ). Whilst in domestic settings, dogs, cats, hamsters, and rabbits are also at risk from infection. Importantly, mice and rats are not susceptible, so hamsters and ferrets are being used as models of human COVID-19, instead of mice. Of the 35 birds tested only the blue tit shows an infection risk. Similarly, the Nile tilapia is the only fish out of the 72 in this study which shows a low change in energy of the complex, suggesting susceptibility to infection. Also, all 14 reptiles and amphibians we investigated do not show any risk.",

Both are highly co-expressed in susceptible cell types, such as type II pneumocytes in the lungs, ileal absorptive enterocytes in the gut, and nasal goblet secretory cells 42 . Since both proteins are required for infection of host cells, and since our analyses clearly support suggestions of conserved binding of S-protein:ACE2 across animal species, we decided to analyse whether the TMPRSS2 was similarly conserved. There is no known structure of TMPRSS2, so we built a high-quality model from a template structure (PDB ID 5I25). Since TMPRSS2 is a serine protease, and the key catalytic residues are known, we used FunFams to identify highly conserved residues in the active site and the cleavage site that are likely to be involved in substrate binding. This resulted in two sets of residues that we analysed: the active site and cleavage site residues (ASCS), and the active site and cleavage site residues plus residues within 8\u212b of catalytic residues that are highly conserved in the FunFam (ASCSEX). The sum of Grantham scores for mutations in the active site and cleavage site for TMPRSS2 is zero or consistently lower than ACE2 in all organisms under consideration, for both ASCS and ASCSEX residues (Fig. 3 ). This means that the mutations in TMPRSS2 involve more conservative changes.",

The phylogeny is consistent with previous work 2 which identified the virus isolated from horseshoe bats (RaTG13, EPI_ISL_402131) as the closest genome to SARS-CoV-2 strains currently available (Fig. 4) . Aided by a large community effort, thousands of human-associated SARS-CoV-2 genome assemblies are now accessible on GISAID 16, 17 . To date, these also include one assembly generated from a virus infecting a domestic dog (EPI_ISL_414518), one obtained from a zoo tiger (EPI_ISL_420923) and one obtained from a mink (EPI_ISL_431778). SARS-CoV-2 strains from animal infections all fall within the phylogenetic diversity observed in human lineages (Fig. 4a) . The receptor binding domain is completely conserved (Fig. 4b-c ) across both human and animal SARS-CoV-2, with replacements in the spike protein of dog (S-protein V8L), tiger (S-protein D614G) and mink (S-protein D614G) strains relative to Wuhan-Hu-1 also observed in humanassociated lineages 43 , consistent with circulation in non-human hosts. Of note, whilst genome-wide data indicates a closer phylogenetic relationship between SARS-CoV-2 strains and RaTG13, the receptor binding domain alignment instead supports a closer relationship with a virus isolated from pangolins 44 (EPI_ISL_410721; Fig. 4c ), in line with previous reports 45 .

Given the role that the stability of the complex, formed between the S-protein and its receptors, could contribute to the viral host range, zoonosis and anthroponosis, there is a clear need to study these interactions. However, relative changes in the energies of the S-protein:ACE2 complex have not been explored experimentally or in silico. A number of recent studies 20,21,39 have suggested that, due to high conservation of ACE2, some animals are vulnerable to infection by SARS-CoV-2. Concerningly, these animals could, in theory, serve as reservoirs of the virus, increasing the risk of future transmission across species, but transmission rates across species are not known. Therefore, it is important to try to predict which other animals could potentially be infected by SARS-CoV-2, so that the plausible extent of zoonotic transmission can be estimated, and surveillance efforts can be guided appropriately.",

Our predictions suggest that, whilst many mammals are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2, birds, fish and reptiles are not likely to be. We manually analysed residues in the S-protein:ACE2 interface, including DC residues that directly contacted the other protein, and DCEX residues that also included residues within 8\u212b of the binding residues, that may affect binding. We clearly showed the advantage of performing more sophisticated studies of the changes in energy of the complex, over more simple measures--such as the number or chemical nature of mutated residues--used in other studies. Furthermore, the wider set of DCEX residues that we identified near the binding interface had a higher correlation to the phenotype data than the DC residues. In addition to ACE2, we also analysed how mutations in TMPRSS2 impact binding to the S-protein. We found that mutations in TMPRSS2 are less disruptive than mutations in ACE2, indicating that binding interactions in the S-protein:TMPRSS2 complex in different species will not be affected.",

In some cases, we had found discrepancies between our energy calculations and experimental phenotypes. To test our predictions, we manually analysed how the shape or chemistry of residues may impact complex stability for all DC residues and a selection of DCEX residues. In agreement with other studies 25 , we identified a number of locations in ACE2 that are important for binding the S-protein. These locations, namely the hydrophobic cluster near the N-terminus and two hotspot locations near residues 31 and 353, stabilise the binding interface. Five DC residues have species-specific variants and influence how well S-protein can bind utilising these key interface regions. In agreement with our calculations in changes in energy of the Sprotein:ACE2 complex, our structural studies do not support (in vivo) infection of horseshoe bat, which has variants at three out of five variant DC residues, one of which (D38N) causes the loss of a salt bridge and H-bonding interactions between ACE2 and S-protein at hotspot 353. These detailed structural analyses are supported by the high Grantham score and calculated total \u0394\u0394G for the change in energy of the complex. Both dog and cat have a physico-chemically similar variant at this hotspot (D38E), which although disrupting the salt bridge still permits alternative H-bonding interactions between the spike RBD and ACE2.",

Our structures show how SARS-CoV-2 can utilise this pocket for binding at the interface in a wide range of species. Of species with DCEX variants at this pocket, only guinea pig maintains an entirely hydrophobic environment (M82A), whilst also conserving three out of the five variant DC residues. This helps explain why we predict moderate risk of infection, in contrast to the in vitro experimental data that reports no infection. For marmoset, there is contradictory in vivo and in vitro experimental data. Our energy calculations suggest no risk and the structural analyses support this by identifying a large structural difference caused by a 39 residue insert. This alters the overall structural superposition of the marmoset and human structures, which could affect the energy of the complex.

Although we felt that these faster methods were justified by the need for timely answers to these questions, there are clearly caveats to our work that should be taken into account. Whilst we use a state of the art modelling tool 53 and an endorsed method for calculating changes in energy of the complex 54 , molecular dynamics may give a more accurate picture of energy changes by sampling rotamer space more comprehensively. However, such an approach would have been prohibitively expensive at a time when it is clearly important to identify animals at risk as quickly as possible. Furthermore, although the animals we highlight at risk from our changes in binding energy calculations correlate well with the experimental data, there is only a small amount of such data currently available, and many of the experimental papers reporting these data are yet to be peer reviewed. Finally, we restricted our analyses to one strain of SARS-CoV-2, but other strains may have evolved with mutations that give more complementary interfaces.
