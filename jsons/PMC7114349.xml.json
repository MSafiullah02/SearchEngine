            "text": "Rabies is an important disease, fatal in 100% of cases if no treatment is administered. The disease spreads through domestic and wildlife animals. Despite the existence of effective pre- and post-exposure treatments, at least 60,000 deaths occur worldwide annually from rabies (Meslin and Stohr, 1997). The first rabies vaccine (Pasteur, 1885), consisted of subcutaneous inoculation of spinal cord suspension derived from rabid rabbits. Since then, improved vaccines have been developed (Perrin et al., 1990, Plotkin, 1993). Despite this, the disease continues to be a problem because it spreads through wildlife, and effective vaccines are unaffordable for animals and poorer sections of human population. The nerve tissue vaccine often leads to neurological complications (Swamy et al., 1984). It is desirable to develop safer, cheaper and efficacious vaccine against rabies.",

The G protein of rabies virus has been identified as the major antigen that induces protective immunity (Cox et al., 1977). The native G protein is 524 amino acids long, consisting of 19-residue long signal peptide at N-terminus (Anilionis et al., 1981), a 22 amino acid transmembrane domain and a 44 amino acid cytoplasmic domain (Fishbein and Robinson, 1993, Wunner et al., 1988). Glycosylation of the G protein is required for immunoprotection by the rabies vaccines (Foley et al., 2000).",

The first vaccine in plants was reported by Curtiss and Cardineau (1990), who expressed the Streptococcus mutans surface protein antigen A (SpaA) in tobacco. This was followed by Mason et al. (1992), who expressed hepatitis B surface antigen in transgenic plants. Since then, several proteins of different origin have been expressed in plants. These include Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin antigen (Haq et al., 1995, Tacket et al., 1998), enkephalins (Vandekerckhove et al., 1989), human serum albumin (Sijmon et al., 1990), glucocerebrosidase and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (Cramer et al., 1999), Norwalk virus surface protein (Mason et al., 1996), VP1 antigen from foot and mouth disease virus (Carrillo et al., 1998, Wigdorovitz et al., 1999), cholera toxin B subunit (Arakawa et al., 1998), rabies antigen (McGarvey et al., 1995), human cytomegalovirus glycoprotein B (Takaberry et al., 1999), the S protein of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (Gomez et al., 2000, Tuboly et al., 2000), respiratory syncytial virus G and F proteins (Belanger et al., 2000, Sandhu et al., 2000), the VP6 protein of rotavirus (Chung et al., 2000, Kim et al., 2001), the measles (Huang et al., 2001) and rinderpest (Khandelwal et al., 2003) virus hemagglutinin proteins and an epitope from the major surface antigen of Plasmodium falciparum (Gosh et al., 2002). Some of the recombinant proteins expressed in plants have shown sufficient promise to warrant human clinical trials (Tacket et al., 1998, Tacket et al., 2000). In case of rabies, McGarvey et al. (1995) noticed stable expression of the rabies surface protein in transgenic tomato but immunoprotective ability was not reported. The present study reports the designing of a chimeric gene encoding the rabies virus surface glycoprotein G for its high-level expression in tobacco plants. The G protein enriched fractions gave immunoprotection against virus challenge in mice.",

            "text": "A 1.67 kbp double stranded DNA was theoretically designed to code for a modified sequence of the glycoprotein G of rabies virus ERA strain (EMBL:RHRBGP). Plant-preferred translation initiation context TAAACAATG (Joshi, 1987, Sawant et al., 2001) and codons were used in designing the DNA sequence of the gene. A total of 412 out of the 505 native codons were altered to replace with the codons preferred in plants. The codons ending in CG were avoided since these could provide sites for methylation. The TA ending codons were avoided as these are less stable energetically and are used less often in plants. The putative transcription termination signals (AAUAAA and its variants), mRNA instability element (ATTTA) and potential splice sites were eliminated and long hairpin loops were avoided. The native signal peptide was substituted with a tobacco pathogenesis related signal peptide (Sijmon et al., 1990) at the N-terminal end. An 18 nucleotide long sequence was placed at 3\u2032 end of the gene to provide SEKDEL for anchoring of the G protein within the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum. A summary of the various alterations introduced in the gene to facilitate high level expression in dicot plants is given in Table 1\n. The whole sequence was synthesised as 50 overlapping oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotides were synthesised on Gene Assembler Special (Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden), purified on urea-polyacrylamide gel and assembled into three fragments by polymerase chain reaction (Singh et al., 1996). The assembled fragments were cloned in pBluescript SK+ cloning vector. At least six clones were sequenced in each case to locate the possible errors in synthesis. Sequencing was done on model 377 automatic DNA sequencer using fluorescent-dye termination cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystem Inc., USA). The errors were corrected by exchanging the regions containing mutations with those from correct clones. Finally, the error-free DNA fragments were stepwise ligated to give a full-length gene of about 1.6 kbp (Fig. 1\n).",

The plates were incubated with 100 \u03bcl/well of p-nitrophenyl phosphate for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C, the enzyme-substrate reaction was stopped by adding 50 \u03bcl/well of 3N NaOH and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm. The immunized mice were intracerebrally challenged with 10 \u00d7 LD50 of live Challenge Virus Standard (CVS) rabies virus and kept under observation for the appearance of symptoms. After 14 days of the challenge, the survival of mice was recorded.",

Transcription of the G protein-coding gene was monitored in individual plant by RT-PCR. Positions of the forward primer (VSS1) from the region coding for the signal peptide (PR-S), and the reverse primer (SA 60) from the 3\u2032 end of the G protein gene are shown in Fig. 1. These amplified the expected 1.6 kbp fragment (Fig. 2\n). No transcript was detected in the non-transgenic line. All the transgenic lines were phenotypically normal. Quantitative analysis of the G protein transcript in transgenic tobacco plants was carried out by real-time-PCR. The results (Fig. 3\n) show the number of amplification cycles (x-axis), after which the amplicon was detected (Ct). The relative level of the G protein transcript in the leaves of transgenic plants is estimated quantitatively from the number of cycles required for amplification as compared to that for ubiquitin taken as the internal control. The relative values can be seen for four transgenic plants in Fig. 3. The relative value obtained for quantitation is expressed as 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct where \u0394Ct represents the difference between the Ct value of G protein transcript and that of ubiquitin. The \u0394\u0394Ct is the difference between the \u0394Ct value of G protein transcript between a given transgenic plant and the least expressing transgenic plant. As shown in Fig. 3, a 1060-fold difference in the level of expression was noticed among the selected transgenic lines. The highest expressing transgenic line A100-13 started showing exponential increase in signal (due to amplification) from the 19th cycle. It was selected for further studies on the plant-expressed G protein.",

Solubilized surface protein of authentic rabies virus (disrupted with Triton X-100 and purified by human anti-rabies IgG antibody affinity chromatography) and the G protein purified from transgenic tobacco showed nearly similar molecular mass (Fig. 7A and B).

High level expression of the G protein in tobacco leaves is evident from Fig. 7C and D where, the expected immunopositive band can be seen even in crude protein preparation of the leaves from transgenic plants.

The G protein expressed in yeast is glycosylated. Yet, it gives protection only against intramuscular and not intracerebral virus challenge (Klepfer et al., 1993), apparently due to differences in yeast-based glycosylations. Vaccination of subjects with DNA coding for the G protein triggers protective levels of virus neutralizing antibodies in animal models (Biswas et al., 2001, Lodmell et al., 2003, Bahloul et al., 2003).

The vaccine derived by expressing the G protein in plants is a promising possibility, provided such a protein is sufficiently immunoprotective. The only study where an anti-rabies antigen has been expressed in plants and examined for immunoprotection is for the vaccine derived by expressing a chimeric peptide (comprising a 23 amino acid antigenic determinants from the G protein and a 15 amino acid determinants from the N protein) on the surfaces of plant viruses (Modelska et al., 1998, Yusibov et al., 2002). The recombinant virus particles purified from plant tissue gave protective immunity in mice after intra-muscular challenge with lethal dose. However, protection by G protein alone expressed in plant cells and effectiveness of the chimeric protein against intracerebral challenge were not reported in these studies. Moreover, the size of the antigenic polypeptide that can be expressed on the surface of a plant virus vector is limited (Yusibov et al., 1997) and that may limit the development of sufficiently effective virus neutralizing epitopes. Further, the expression is transient and containment could be a significant problem at agricultural level, especially with environmentally stable viruses like TMV. Full-length G protein has earlier been expressed in plant system only by McGarvey et al. (1995). However, in that study, animal experiments were not attempted. Hence, the utility of plants in expressing immunoprotective G protein has not been established earlier.",

They can fold and assemble proteins in a manner similar to higher eukaryotes. In our study, the signal peptide of the native G protein was replaced by the tobacco PR-S signal peptide (Sijmon et al., 1990), known to be efficient in transport of proteins in to the endoplasmic reticulum of the cells. The 5\u2032 end of the gene provided an efficient translation initiation context. An ER-retention signal (SEKDEL) was provided at C-terminal of the G protein. The gene was codon optimized to facilitate high-level expression in plants. A summary of the modifications made in the gene is given in Table 1. The gene thus designed, expressed at a high level in a majority of the transgenic plants. A wide variation in the level of expression (0.001\u20130.38% of leaf protein) in leaves was noticed at population level. This is understandably due to integration of the transgene at different positions in the genome of independentally selected transgenic lines (Peach and Velten, 1991).",

This difference is apparently due to glycosylation of the protein in tobacco leaf and not in E. coli. In an earlier case, where full length G protein was expressed in plants, a protein of 60\u201362 kDa was noticed in tomato (McGarvey et al., 1995). Lower molecular mass observed (as compared to 66 kDa surface protein in the virus particles obtained from animal cells) in that study was attributed to differences in glycosylation between the plant and animal cells. The degradation of G protein to smaller peptides encountered by McGarvey et al. (1995) was also not seen in our work (Fig. 7). In our study, the protein that accumulates in tobacco leaves is of higher molecular mass, comparable to the authentic surface protein of rabies virus. This is presumably due to efficient glycosylation, because we provided the G protein an efficient signal peptide and an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal. Confocal microscopy (data not included) established that the G protein was localized in endoplasmic reticulum of tobacco leaf cells. The results suggest that localization of G protein in endoplasmic reticulum may be critical for its glycosylation, folding into a conformation required for immunoprotection and for its stability in plant cells.",

            "text": "\nMcGarvey et al. (1995) did not report the immunogenicity of the G protein expressed in tomato. Moreover, they reported a rather low level of expression and could obtain G protein from the tomato tissue, only after immunoprecipitation. In selected transgenic lines, we noticed at least 100-fold higher expression level in tobacco leaves as compared to them. Some of the best expressors like A100-13, gave the G protein at about 0.38% of the total leaf protein. Immunologically, the protein could be detected in even crude protein preparation from the leaves of such lines (Fig. 7C and D). The leaf expressed G protein could be purified to homogeneity in a number of ways, as explained in results. High expression is presumably due to several aspects considered by us in designing of the gene. Optimizing the codons to use plant-preferred codons greatly affects expression level (Haq et al., 1995, Mason et al., 1998) of proteins in plants. Horvath et al. (2000), reported a high yield of bacterial (1,3-1,4)-\u03b2-glucanase in the endosperm of mature grain when C + G content was raised to 63%. The addition of ER-retention signal at C-terminal has been suggested to enhance the accumulation of recombinant proteins in transgenic plants (Mason et al., 1998, Munro and Pelham, 1987, Napier et al., 1998, Wandelt et al., 1992). Stoger et al. (2000), reported protein accumulation, irrespective of the mRNA level, suggesting that the addition of KDEL at C-terminal resulted in enhanced accumulation of antibodies in plants. The increase in accumulation due to SEKDEL may be due to lower turn over of the protein, as reported in case of ScFv where difference in protein yield was observed between the ER and apoplast (Schouten et al., 1996). Our study demonstrates that a codon optimized gene that targets the rabies glycoprotein to endoplasmic reticulum of tobacco leaves is expressed at a high-level and is immunogenic as well as immunoprotective in animal model.",
