Of 34 patients included, median age was 6.5 months, median body weight was 6050 g, and 16 (47%) were female. According to the Mann-Whitney U test, there were no differences between the two groups concerning demographic and intraoperative data, postoperative chemical data. C1q concentration was only significant lower in patients with C1-inh non-treated group than in patients with C1-inh treated group. But, the consumption of C1q, C3, C4, CH 50 , and C1-inh in patients with C1-inhibitor non-treated group was observed early postoperatively. There is a significant difference in the values before and after C1-inh treatment between the two groups. The lower value in the C1-inh-treated group is explained by the activation of the classical pathway through the replenishment of complements by C1-inh treatment. This study proposes the administration of C1-inh is an effective therapy to reduce the activation and improve the clinical capillary leak syndrome.",

            "text": "The use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is necessary for the correction of many complex cardiac defects in neonates and infants. Surgical results for most defects have improved over the last several years, but there persists significant morbidity related to the inflammatory insult of CPB. CPB in combination with anaesthesia, medication, vascular injury and surgical stress affects the extent of inflammatory response. Complement system protein may be activated through the classical, alternative and lectin pathways, leading to generation of biologically active products, such as C5a and the terminal membrane attack complex (MAC), and ultimately contributes to endothelial cell disruption during CPB. Significant differences in the complement factor levels indicate a higher grade of complement activation and simultaneous contact activation in patients during and after CPB. Thus, the main cause of systemic inflammatory reaction after CPB is the contact of the blood to non-biologic surfaces of the CPB circuit and not surgical procedures or anesthesia. To lessen the activation of the complement and contact systems during CPB, it is necessary to use inert materials in the CPB circuit. Because inhibiting drugs may lessen complement and contact system activation, they represent a further possibility for minimizing the damaging effects of CPB [1] . Complement factor C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-inh) levels decrease with CPB in infants. Stiller and colleagues [2] examined C1-inh levels in such patients. They found that after CPB, generalized edema, pulmonary edema, and weight gain were greater in infants with lower C1-inh levels. At 30 min post-CPB, the infants demonstrating these effects had C1-inh activity levels that were 51% of controls compared with 80% of controls in those who did not demonstrate capillary leak syndrome (CLS). This decrease was greater in infants who suffered post-CPB CLS. CLS show evidence of complement activation, decreased complement levels. We thus consecutively investigated several complement compounds before and after pediatric cardiac surgery with CPB. Based on this hypothesis, we tested whether C1-inh supplementation after CPB would ameliorate C1-inh decrease in pulmonary and cardiac dysfunction after CPB. Our prospective study was therefore designed to determine which part of the systemic inflammatory response after cardiac operations resulted from CPB in neonates and infants.",

Though there was no evidence, it was thought that congenital heart disease patients who underwent short CPB time did not present pulmonary edema and capillary leak syndrome. Conventional general anesthesia was conducted with diazepam, fentanyl sulfate, and vecuronium. After induction of anesthesia, nasotracheal intubation was performed in the patients not receiving ventilatory support, and central venous catheters and peripheral arterial catheter were inserted. Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis consisted of ampicillin. The CPB circuit included a roller pump, a disposable membrane oxygenator, and an arterial filter. Cooling and rewarming were carried out with a heat exchanger. The priming solution consisted of a crystalloid solution, mannitol (3 ml/kg), and leukocyte-depleted packed red blood cells to obtain a hematocrit value of the circulating volume of about 25%. For vasodilatation in the cooling and rewarming periods, all neonates received a continuous infusion of sodium nitroprusside 2 \u03bcg/kg/min and chlorpromazine 1 mg/kg. CPB was instituted with a perfusion index of 2.7 L/(min m 2 ), which was maintained throughout the cooling phase. The pump was primed with 80-100 ml of packed cells and 50 ml of lactated Ringer's solution, 1000 IU of heparin, 2.0 ml/kg of sodium bicarbonate 4.2%, and 3 ml/kg of mannitol 20% were added. CPB was instituted at a flow rate of 2.7 L/min/m 2 after systemic anticoagulation, and administration of dexamethasone, 1 mg/kg. During CPB the pH-stat method was used, with correction of PaO 2 to the patients' hypothermic temperature to maintain a pH value of 7.40. After deep hypothermia was reached (minimal nasopharyngeal temperature averaging 25 \u00b0C), aortic cross-clamping was done and cardioplegia was induced with a single intra-aortic injection of a 4 \u00b0C cold St. Thomas solution (30 mL/kg), and cardiac arrest was instituted for a target period of not longer than 60 min. The surgical procedure was continued under high-flow perfusion (50% of the calculated initial perfusion rate). Rewarming was achieved under full-flow conditions. The lungs of the neonates were reventilated when core temperature reached 30 \u00b0C. Neutralization of heparin was achieved with protamine sulfate in a 1:1.5 ratio. Epinephrine, dopamine, olprinone and nitroglycerin were systematically administered for weaning the patients from CPB. After coronary reperfusion and at the end of the operation, the cardiac surgeon, as explained, assessed intraoperative myocardial function here. In cases of hemodynamic instability or myocardial dysfunction at the end of the operation, sternal closure was delayed until stabilization, and sternal wounds were closed with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane.",

To the best of our knowledge, cardiopulmonary bypass can result in a post-CPB syndrome that is characterized by increased vascular permeability, generalized edema, pulmonary dysfunction, and cardiac dysfunction [3] [4] [5] . This syndrome seems to be more intense in neonates and can result in prolonged ventilation, coagulopathy, postcardiotomy cardiac failure, and increased mortality. This is a systemic inflammatory response that appears to be fueled by activation of the complement, contact, coagulation, and fibrinolytic pathways [6] . More recently, Tassani et al. have shown that prophylactic administration of C1INH before CPB is an effective therapeutic approach to reduce the inflammatory response and improve clinical parameters after cardiac surgery requiring CPB in neonates [7] .",

After surgery, it impairs vascular endothelial cells in the lungs and kidneys, causes swelling of parenchymal cells, and triggers an organ failure. Therefore, multiple defense systems are established by several proteins, called complement regulators, to prevent excessive and persistent complement activation and invasion of autologous cells [8, 9] . C1-inhibitor, called C1 inactivator, covalently binds to and inhibits the active sites (serine) of activated C1r and C1s in the C1 step of the classical pathway to suppress 1 3 complement activity. In addition, it inhibits, the enzymatic activities of the coagulation, kallikrein, and plasmin systems, besides the complement system. In fact, in cases deficient in congenital complement control (e.g., Hereditary Angioedema; HAE), bradykinin, as well as C3a and C5a strongly induced by the classical pathway initiated by C1 activation, is deeply involved [10] .",

It is therefore possible that the large dosage may observe the difference in those groups in large trials. Second, anesthetic management was left to the discretion of treating anesthesiologists. This may have affected the outcome given the potential differing effects of anesthetic medications on the development of postoperative CLS.
