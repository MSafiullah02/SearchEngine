            "text": "Diseases of the respiratory tract are one of the primary sources of losses in the Danish beef and dairy cattle industries. It represents a complex problem as the development and severity of the disease are influenced by a number of infectious agents including bacteria, virus and mycoplasmas, as well as factors related to host and environmental conditions, such as immunity, stress, stocking rate, etc. Though intensively studied, the relative significance of several of the infectious agents by themselves remains to be demonstrated conclusively. In Denmark, Haemophilus somnus is one of the most common bacteria isolated from fatal cases of calf pneumonia (Tegtmeier et al., 1999b). Therefore, the present study was focused on H. somnus in order to clarify its potential for inducing pneumonia in healthy unstressed animals under experimental conditions closely resembling the presumed natural route of infection, viz. by aerosol exposure. Mycoplasma dispar is another microorganism often isolated from pneumonic calf lungs (Tegtmeier et al., 1999b), and this microorganism was used for studying concomitant infection with M. dispar and H. somnus.",

This way of introducing the bacterium to the respiratory tract has yielded valuable information on the pathogenesis of the disease. It is, however, not a design that closely mimics the natural route of infection. One can speculate that the introduction of such a huge number of bacteria in a viscous suspension might overload the physical barriers leading to a vicious circle of exacerbated cytokine release, thereby, compromizing the natural defence mechanisms of the lung to a degree uncompatible with the natural pathogenesis of the disease. In that case, the lung lesions might partly be explained as an unbalanced reaction independent of the viability of H. somnus organisms, that is, the lesions could be induced by inoculation of dead bacteria or bacterial components in itself. In line with this, Whiteley et al. (1991) found that inoculation of killed Mannheimia (Pasteurella) haemolytica bacteria were capable of causing fibrin exudation, platelet aggregation and alveolar epithelial damage in a degree similar to live bacteria (The name Pasteurella haemolytica has been changed to Mannheimia haemolytica, Angen et al., 1999).",

However, none of these animals were necropsied, thus no information on pulmonary pathology or concomitant infection with other pathogens was available. Krogh et al.

When H. somnus was inoculated alone (one animal), no pulmonary lesions were present at necropsy, whereas inoculation with M. dispar prior to the H. somnus inoculation (three animals) lead to scanty to more extensive consolidation in the lungs.",

One animal was exposed to M. dispar followed by exposure to a sterile saline solution 11 days later (No. 11), and one animal was only exposed to a sterile saline solution (No. 12). All calves were placed singly in the aerosol chamber and exposed to approximately 25 ml of the inoculum. For determination of airborne viable H. somnus or M. dispar organisms in the chamber, a two step Andersen Sampler (Andersen, 1958), was connected. The Andersen Sampler allows 23 l air per minute to pass, and the lowest step of sampler only allows the respirable fraction, that is, particles with an aerodynamic diameter <5 \u03bcm to pass (Jacobsen et al., 1996). During inoculation, blood agar plates were placed in the Andersen Sampler for periods of 5 min, followed by incubation as described under post-mortem examination (2.5). Animals exposed to H. somnus or sterile saline (No. 1\u20133 and 6\u201312) were euthanized 4 days after inoculation, whereas the two calves only exposed to M. dispar (No. 4 and 5) were euthanized 11 days after inoculation.",

This microorganism and associated diseases have been studied intensively and was reviewed by Frank (1989). According to that review, healthy calves carry small numbers of M. haemolytica serotype 1 in the nasopharynx and when, for example, concomitant stress or viral infection compromise the defence mechanisms, the animals get highly susceptible to pneumonic pasteurellosis as the bacteria are able to multiply rapidly in the nasopharynx. Thus, high numbers of bacteria may subsequently be inhaled in aerosol droplets to the lower parts of the respiratory system where a rapid replication in the lungs will result in development of pneumonia. A similar pathogenesis for H. somnus induced pneumonia is a natural assumption, although the ability of H. somnus to develop disease in the present study was minimal. Even though direct inhalation of high numbers H. somnus into the lung parenchyma as well as multiplication of the bacteria on the nasal mucosa were possible (as H. somnus was detected from nasal svabs by PCR in all animals inoculated with H. somnus), no pneumonic lesions developed in the majority of the cases.

These observations strongly indicate that stress due to, for example, transportation, concomitant infection, damage of the respiratory tract, and/or immunosuppresion is necessary for establishment of a bacterial pneumonia. This is in accordance with our results which furthermore revealed that infection with M. dispar alone was not sufficient as predisposing factor. Therefore, one should consider other predisposing factors. In Denmark, BRS virus is a common pathogen detected in pneumonic lungs (Tegtmeier et al., 1999b) and this virus might, as BHV-1, be able to play the triggering role in development of pneumonia.",

This response is most probably due to the inhalation of bacteria into the lungs where resident macrophages have been reported, at least in the pig to be particularly sensitive to bacterial LPS (Lin et al., 1994). Peripheral blood cell changes occurred 2\u20133 days after inoculation with H. somnus. The granulocytes were active as shown by phagocytosis of propidium iodide-labelled Staphylococcus aureus measured by FACS analysis (data not shown). The changes in peripheral blood cells clearly indicated that a significant expansion of granulocytes took place immediately after challenge and peaked at 2 days after challenge whereas the lymphocyte population remained remarkably constant (Fig. 1). This is consistent with the induction of mRNA for IL-8 peaking from 3 h to between 12 and 72 h after exposure in different animals, all indicating that bacteria were indeed introduced into the lungs giving rise to a systemic granulocyte reponse.",

The amount of bacteria used for inoculation is most probably higher than what is found under natural conditions. Nevertheless, the granulocytosis and the induction of mRNA for IL-8 presumably mimic the response occurring when calves are exposed to H. somnus under natural conditions, thus giving valuable information on the cellular mechanisms involved in defeating the development of pneumonia.",
