The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 has rapidly formed a global pandemic, causing hundreds of thousands of infections and huge economic loss. The WHO declares that more precise measures to track, detect and isolate infected people are among the most effective means to quickly contain the outbreak. Based on trajectory big data and the theory of mean-field, we establish an aggregated risk mean field that contains information of all risk-spreading particles by proposing a spatio-temporal model named HiRES risk map. It has dynamic fine spatial resolution and high computation efficiency enabling fast update. We then propose an objective personal epidemic risk scoring model named HiRES-p based on HiRES risk maps, and use it to develop statistical inference based method and machine learning based method for detecting suspected epidemic-infected individuals. We conduct numerical experiments by applying the proposed methods to study the early outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Results show that the HiRES risk map has strong ability in capturing global trend and local variability of the epidemic risk, thus can be applied to monitor epidemic risk at country, province, city and community levels, as well as at specific high-risk locations such as at hospital and station. HiRES-p score is an effective measurement of personal epidemic risk. The detection rates as defined by successful classification are above 90% as long as the population infection rate is under 20%, which indicates great application potential in epidemic risk prevention and control practice.",

On March 11th of 2020, The World Health Organization declared spread of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 is a global pandemic, when 118,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were found in 114 countries, with 4,291 deaths [1] . Although SARS-COV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been found to have lower case fatality rate than either SARS or Middle East respiratory syndrome-realted coronavirus (MERS-COV) [2] , the sheer speed of its geographical expansion and surge in numbers of confirmed cases severely impact public health system. Person-to-person transmission seems to be the main method of transmission for SARS-COV-2, according to CDC of the United States [3] . The person-to-person transmission routes of SARS-COV-2 include direct transmission, such as cough, sneeze, droplet inhalation transmission, and contact transmission, such as the contact with oral, nasal, and eye mucous membranes [4] . But limitation of our knowledge on SARS-COV-2 and diversified symptoms of the infected patients complicate the diagnosis of COVID-19 [2] [5] . In addition, a significant percentage of infected patients, ranging from 18% to 50% as estimated in difference research, are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms, but they could still be highly contagious [6] . Therefore, early identification of infected individuals and blocking their transmission paths are keys to effectively stop virus from spreading.",

In these epidemic models, basic reproduction number R 0 is the key parameter for quantifying the virus epidemic. Liu et al. reviewed published studies on estimation of R 0 of COVID-19 extracted from PubMed, bioRxiv and Google Scholar during January 1st to February 7th, 2020 [7] . Results show that the estimated R 0 varies from 2.2 to 6.49, and estimations obtained from the mechanism-based dynamic modeling is significantly higher than those obtained using statistical methods based on exponential growth model. Lack of robustness in estimation of the basic reproduction number may result in misleading estimates of the epidemic trend of COVID-19 as well as the size of infected population. In addition, these epidemic models cannot predict the infection status of a specific individual, thus can only play a limited role in practice of epidemic prevention and control. Epidemiology investigation used to be the main method of exploring transmission process of infected individuals, but \"omissions and errors in previous activities can occur when the investigation is performed through only a proxy interview with the patient\" [8] .",

It provides estimates on the degree of influenza activities at weekly and regional scale for the United States, with a reporting lag about one day [9] [10] . Another example is more recent. South Korea's response to the outbreak of COVID-19 has been praised by a number of international health experts [11] . Its outstanding achievements in the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic largely depend on the comprehensive application of multi-source data, such as data from medical facility records, Global Positioning System, card transactions, and closed-circuit television. Methods that can objectively verify the patients claims are adopted for conducting COVID-19 contact investigations in South Korea, which have collected more accurate and timely information on the location, time of exposure, and details of the transmission situations.

Firstly, based on the theory of mean field, we propose a spatio-temporal model, namely HiRES, to provide high-resolution estimation of regional epidemic risk based on trajectory data of confirmed infections and obtain HiRES epidemic risk maps through mapping the estimated spatial epidemic risk to the corresponding base station cells. The main idea of the mean field theory is to focus on one particle and it assume that the most important contribution to the interactions of such particle with its neighboring particles is determined by the mean field due to the neighboring particles [32] . Based on this theory, instead of investigating how each confirmed case, i.e., a risk-spreading particle, interact with the rest of population, which is impossible or computationally costly, we establish an aggregated risk mean field that contains information of all risk spreading particles. Then based on this epidemic risk mean field, we propose a scoring model HiRES-p to estimate the personal epidemic risk of each individual using the HiRES maps and his/her trajectory data. Finally, based on the HiRES-p scores, we develop detection methods using both statistical inference approach and machine learning approach to detect and classify suspected individuals.",

For example, wireless signals are subject to drift due to the influence of surrounding. In order to ensure seamless coverage of wireless signals and uninterrupted communication during mobile phone moving, multiple base station cells signals often overlap in one place. When a users track records switch back and forth between different base station cells in short time, which are defined as 'A-B-A'-switch in short time, where A, B are base station cell, we discard the record of base station cell B of this timestamp, and believe user is still at base station cell A.",

Exclusion of high-speed movement samples from our analysis is based on the following logic: if a confirmed case passes a BSC when traveling by car, train, airplane, etc, his viral shedding to region covered by this BSC is almost negligible by all means due to the fast movement and enclosed space. In addition, we also exclude record with dwell time less than 300 seconds assuming viral shedding need more than 5 minutes to happen.",

It can be observed that Wuhan urban area has the highest risk value, and risk of infection radiates to surrounding cities and counties with Wuhan as the center.

The estimated correlation coefficients for China, Beijing, and Wuhan are 0.9492, 0.9665 and 0.9967. This reveals that the regional risk estimated by the HiRES risk map has a strong positive correlation with the total number of confirmed cases in that region. As is shown in Figure 6-(a) , from a macro perspective, the HiRES risk map can reasonably estimate the total regional risk and the size of the infected population, thus can be used as a scientific support for the macro policy-making of the epidemic prevention and control. We also investigate local temporal variability of representative locations in Wuhan and Beijing. Six categories of locations are investigated, which are hospital, commercial district, station, school, residence and randomly selected area. 10 samples are collected for each category in each city. Totally 120 locations are evaluated. Based on the daily HiRES risk map, the epidemic risk of each location is calculated as the sum of the risk values of the base station cells within the specified radius of the location, and radius of each location is set according to actual conditions for each category as specified in Table 2 . HiRES map for each category of local locations in Beijing and Wuhan, respectively. It's clear observed that in January 2020, local risk evolution in Beijng and Wuhan are totally different, with those in Wuhan exhibiting a significant trend of increase. But location category of highrisk identified from the HiRES risk map are consistent between Beijing and Wuhan, which are station, hospital and school. These findings coincident with common sense and the actual situations since these are all locations with dense crowds and infected cases often gather. In addition, among the ten designated hospitals for COVID-19, Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan Union Hospital, and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital have higher risk values. Among them, Risk of Tongji Hospital is several times higher than other hospitals, which is confirmed by the fact that Tongji admitted the most confirmed cases during the early outbreak in Wuhan. In the category of supermarket, the Southern China Seafood Market in Wuhan, as a well known gathering place of confirmed cases in the early stages of the outbreak, has been singled out with consistently and significantly higher risk estimate as shown in Figure 6 -(d); its risk started to increase rapidly from January 4th and reached a peak around mid of January, then experienced a sharp decline after the closure of the city.",

F 0 is estimated by the empirical cumulative distribution functionF 0 of 100000 HiRES-p scores calculated for the normal group on January 24th, 2020. Consequently the 95% quartile ofF 0 is taken to be the critical value of the test, which is 1.19955. Thus the significant level of the test is expected to be 5%, or in other words, we control the type I error of false alarm at 5%. Then, we calculate testing statistic for each individual in the training dataset, i.e., their HiRES-p scores, and compare them with the critical value. If the HiRES-p score is larger than the critical value, this individual is declared to be detected as a suspected case. A total of 2186 are detected out of 2757 confirmed cases, indicating an overall detection rate around 80%. Change of detection rate with respect to the date of diagnosed are presented in the following Figure 8 . When controlling the false alarm rate to be 5%, the detection rate of our statistical inference based method is about 80% with low temporal variability during the 5-day period. For machine Learning based detecting method, we firstly extract data feature by defining an explicit function form for calculating HiRES-p score. Since machine learning method is good at dealing with high dimensional data, it's not necessary to reduce the dimension of the score series during the incubation period such as through summation or taking maximum. If we assume the incubation period parameter T = 14, a simple feature would be a T-dimension vector containing the T HiRES-p scores calculated during the past incubation period. Unfortunately, trajectory data for the normal group only start from January 17th. Thus, due to limitation of our dataset, our machine learning algorithms use only 8 features which are the HiRES-P scores obtained from January 17th to January 24th. This is a classical binary classification problem, and we assume \"diagnosed\" to be 1 and \"healthy\" to be -1. We select 80% of the mixed dataset as the training set with the rest of them to be the testing set. We try three classical classifiers: Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and Random Forest. A successful detection is defined as a correct classification. The detection rates of machine learning based method in terms of rates of successful classification (RSC) for this numerical experiment can be found in Table 3 . For inference based method, detection rate is defined by successful identification of suspected cases; while for machine learning based method, detection rate is defined by successful classification. For comparison purpose, we transform the detection rate of the inference based method to a classification accuracy estimation, i.e., (2186 + 95000)/(2757 + 100000) \u2248 94.58%. Therefore, we conclude machine learning based method outperform the inference based method on detecting suspected cases when population infection rate is 3%.",

Based on this research, we set incubation period T=14 days in our experiments. We assume virus exponential decay as this formula \u03b4 s = e 1 s , s = 1, 2, ..., 14, where s represents days from current time to diagnosed date, and set residence time proportion 0 ahead of it. 3. Outdoor decay coefficient of virus Outdoor decay coefficient measures how long virus keep active after viral shedding. [34] Neeltje et.al. show COVID-19 was most stable on plastic and stainless steel and viable virus could be detected up to 72 hours. Thus, in our application study, epidemic risk on BSCs and personal risk score are the weighted sum of 3 days values.",
