            "text": "While the number of coronavirus cases from 2019 continues to grow, hospitals are reporting shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) for frontline healthcare workers. Furthermore, PPE for the eyes and mouth, such as face shields, allow for additional protection when working with aerosols. 3-D printing enables the easy and rapid production of lightweight plastic frameworks based on open-source data. The practicality and clinical suitability of four face shields printed using a fused deposition modeling printer were examined. The weight, printing time, and required tools for assembly were evaluated. To assess the clinical suitability, each face shield was worn for one hour by 10 clinicians and rated using a visual analogue scale. The filament weight (21-42 g) and printing time (1:40-3:17 h) differed significantly between the four frames. Likewise, the fit, wearing comfort, space for additional PPE, and protection varied between the designs. For clinical suitability, a chosen design should allow sufficient space for goggles and N95 respirators as well as maximum coverage of the facial area. Consequently, two datasets are recommended. For the final selection of the ideal dataset to be used for printing, scalability and economic efficiency need to be carefully balanced with an acceptable degree of protection.",

Face shields in combination with additional PPE (goggles and mouth/nose mask) have been shown to reduce the risk of inhalational exposure, especially when performing activities with aerosol formation [9, 11] . HCWs, particularly those prone to contact with potentially infected aerosols, are at high risk of exposure to an increased viral load and should be provided with the appropriate PPE to prevent infection and avoid possible nosocomial spreading routes [12] . Face shields are PPE devices used by many workers (e.g., medical, dental, and veterinary personnel) for protection of the facial area from splashes, sprays, or the spatter of body fluids. However, face shields should be used with other protective equipment and, as such, are classified as adjunctive PPEs [9] . Recommendations on face shield use differ depending on the setting but the essential use of PPEs in the population during a pandemic has led the WHO to appeal for an increase in their production [13] . Supplementary PPEs are recommended for high-risk HCWs in particular, including goggles for eye protection and face shields to avoid contamination of the facial area. Due to their proximity to patients and subsequent potential exposure to infected airborne particles or aerosols [14, 15] , the presence of oral fluids, and the use of sharp instruments, HCWs are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection [16] .",

Face shields are considered Class I medical devices, exempt from Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Pre-Market Notification (Form 510 [K]) [9] , which can be manufactured using materials that have been classified harmless when in contact with skin or food. Therefore, to provide HCWs with sufficient PPEs to increase facial protection, face shields could be 3-D printed. 3-D printers are in widespread use for professional and private purposes. Despite not being as fast as injection molding processes, this method of production allows the at-home, on-demand manufacture of face shields by a broad spectrum of users. This study evaluates the utilization of 3-D printers, which are otherwise used for dental purposes, to produce face shields using open-source design data and investigates their clinical suitability.",

While both printing techniques require support structures in non-supported areas, FDM-based techniques will generally require fewer support structures. Thus, this process further decreases the time needed for post-processing. Moreover, some design features such as the clamping slot of the Easy 3D Face Shield or the shield curvature aid of the RC2 can result in failures when using SLA-techniques due to the non-removable support structures in non-accessible gaps or fissures.",

The Prusa i3 MKS3 sample used in the present study features a print bed with a width of 210 mm, a length of 210 mm, and a maximum printing height of 250 mm. The sample is, therefore, suitable for printing all of the face shields evaluated. Other printers, e.g., Form 3 (Formlabs, Somerville, Massachusetts, USA) do not offer the printing volume needed. In order to print the RC2 design, the dataset would have to be scaled to 95% and/or the printing direction changed to fit onto the printing platform. Changing the size may result in an improved or diminished fit of the face shield.

Polyethylene terephthalate (PETG) combines both the high fracture strength of ABS and the reduced susceptibility to failure of PLA. However, again, it lacks biodegradability.

Visors can be manufactured from several types of materials that include polycarbonate, propionate, acetate, poly(vinylchloride), and PETG [9] .

In particular, increased efforts in realizing real-time, on-demand in-campus production allows for independence from external suppliers and a decreased need for stock-piling [24] . This will increase flexibility in daily clinical routines and autonomy in emergency situations but will introduce new regulatory challenges [25] . Printing ready-to-use sterile parts using specific cleanroom printing devices will enable further optimization of just-in-time production in the near future and further broaden the application range of additively manufactured goods in hospitals [26] .",

When printing face shields, the printing ability and printing time need to be considered and may vary depending on the design. For clinical suitability, a design should be chosen to allow sufficient space for goggles and N95 respirators as well as maximum coverage of the facial area. Due to its printability, ease of assembly, space for additional PPE, and protection, the Easy 3D face shield was shown to be the most effective. However, it lacks scalability potential (stacking) in non-industrial environments. If large-scale production is a priority, the RC2 should be the preferred option due to the availability of a stacked dataset. ",

The area between the headframe and frame for the visor is open, with the connective area being positioned in the distal part of the headframe. (B) Compared to RC1, the material thickness of the RC2 (Prusa Research, Hole\u0161ovice, Czech Republic) framework is greater. The basic design is similar to that of RC1 except the headframe does not have a clamp fit. (C) Budmen V3 (3D Face Shield V3, Budmen Industries, Philadelphia, PA, USA, https://budmen.com/) consists of one closed and stiffened frame (no clamp fit) extending outward with four pins to attach the visor. (D) Easy 3D (Easy 3D printed Face Shield, Hanoch Hemmerich, La Laguna, Tenerife, Spain, https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4233193)consists of one frame (no clamp fit) with an extension for the visor that is fixed by clamping it into a slot.",
