The Wu language and its dialects has some 77m. native speakers and Cantonese 66m. Around 400m. people in China cannot speak Mandarin. The ideographic writing system of 'characters' is uniform throughout the country, and has undergone systematic simplification. In 1958 a phonetic alphabet (Pinyin) was devised to transcribe the characters, and in 1979 this was officially adopted for use in all texts in the Roman alphabet. The previous transcription scheme (Wade) is still used in Taiwan and Hong Kong. Mainland China is administratively divided into 22 provinces, five autonomous regions (originally entirely or largely inhabited by ethnic minorities, though in some regions now outnumbered by Han immigrants) and four government-controlled municipalities. These are in turn divided into 332 prefectures, 658 cities (of which 265 are at prefecture level and 393 at county level), 2,053 counties and 808 urban districts.

It is among the top recipients of foreign direct investment (FDI) and is the world's largest producer and consumer of coal. In 2005 China made the transition from net receiver of foreign aid to net donor and has established itself as a key player in Africa's economic development, becoming the largest export partner of sub-Saharan Africa in 2013. According to the World Bank, China's cumulative FDI stock in Africa totalled nearly US$34\u00b77bn. in 2015, up from US$14\u00b77bn. in 2011. In 2010 China overtook Japan to become the world's second largest economy after the USA. The first steps from a centrally-planned towards a more market-oriented economy were taken by Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s. He opened the economy to foreign trade and investment, decentralized industrial management and allowed private sector development. In 2001 China became a member of the World Trade Organization, establishing trade relations with many countries. Private entrepreneurs and foreign investors have played an important role in developing the manufacturing sector, China's principal growth engine. Even before 1978 the economy was heavily skewed towards manufacturing, but following the market-oriented transition output increased significantly. During this period there was a structural shift away from large state-owned enterprises (SOEs), although these still remain an important part of the economy. Between 1997 and 2003 the government oversaw reform of SOEs, with many poorly performing businesses privatized or liquidated. Stronger firms were restructured and often listed on the stock market. Many more recent enterprises are labourintensive as distinct from the capital-intensive SOEs. Growth has been fuelled by low added value and labour-intensive exports. However, Chinese firms are predicted to become increasingly competitive with higher added value producers, such as South Korea.",

Macao overtook Nevada as the world's largest gaming market in 2008. Overview After its transfer of sovereignty to the People's Republic of China in 1999, Macao achieved high growth based on tourism and gambling. China's relaxation of travel restrictions in 1999 resulted in an increase in mainland visitors to more than 20m. by 2015 out of a total of 30m. visitors. The cessation of business magnate Stanley Ho's monopoly of the local gaming industry in 2001 and its opening up to foreign competition led to an influx of foreign investment that made Macao the world's biggest gaming centre in 2008. Gambling revenues exceeded US$28bn. in 2015, having grown by more than 20% per year on average from 2008.",

The borders were opened for trade with neighbouring countries in 1980. In 1984 a Buddhist seminary opened in Lhasa, the regional capital, with 200 students, and monasteries and shrines have since been renovated and reopened. There were some 46,000 monks and nuns in 2013. In 1988 Tibetan was reinstated as a 'major official language', competence in which is required of all administrative officials.

In Sept. 2002 direct contact between the exiled government and China was re-established after a nine-year gap. However, in March 2008 anti-Chinese protests in Lhasa ended in violence, with dozens reportedly killed by the Chinese authorities, and in Oct. that year the Dalai Lama stated he had lost hope of reaching agreement with China on Tibet's status.In April 2011 he announced his retirement from active politics in favour of Lobsang Sangay, who had been elected to lead the Tibetan government-in-exile.

On 6 Jan. 1987 Portugal agreed to return Macao to China on 20 Dec. 1999 when it would become a special administrative zone of China, with considerable autonomy.TERRITORY AND POPULATIONThe Macao Special Administrative Region, which lies at the mouth of the Pearl River, comprises a peninsula (9\u00b73 sq. km) connected by a narrow isthmus to the People's Republic of China, on which is built the city of Santa Nome de Deus de Macao, the islands of Taipa (7\u00b76 sq. km), linked to Macao by three bridges, Col\u00f4ane (7\u00b76 sq. km) linked to Taipa by a 2-km causeway, and Cotai, a strip of reclaimed land between Col\u00f4ane and Taipa (6\u00b70 km).

GDP per capita, 2013: US$20,925 KEY HISTORICAL EVENTS Taiwan, christened Ilha Formosa ('beautiful island') by the Portuguese, was ceded to Japan by China by the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895. After the Second World War the island was surrendered to Gen. Chiang Kai-shek who made it the headquarters for his crumbling Nationalist Government. Until 1970 the USA supported Taiwan's claims to represent all of China. Only in 1971 did the government of the People's Republic of China manage to replace that of Chiang Kai-shek at the UN. In Jan. 1979 the USA established formal diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, breaking off formal ties with Taiwan. Taiwan itself has continued to reject attempts at reunification, and although there have been frequent threats of direct action from mainland China (including military manoeuvres off the Taiwanese coast) the prospect of confrontation with the USA supports the status quo.In July 1999 President Lee Teng-hui repudiated Taiwan's 50year-old 'One China' policy-the pretence of a common goal of unification-arguing that Taiwan and China should maintain equal 'state to state' relations. This was a rejection of Beijing's view that Taiwan is no more than a renegade Chinese province which must be reunited with the mainland, by force if necessary. In the presidential election of 18 March 2000 Chen Shui-bian, leader of the Democratic Progressive Party, was elected, together with Annette Lu Hsiu-lien as his Vice President. Both supported independence although Chen Shui-bian made friendly gestures towards China and distanced himself from colleagues who wanted an immediate declaration of independence. Following his wife's indictment on embezzlement charges in Nov. 2006, President Chen survived three parliamentary attempts to impeach him. He was succeeded as president in 2008 by Ma Ying-jeou of the Nationalist Party.",
