These factors could include lymphokines produced by an ongoing immune response or the presence of neurotransmitters with immunostimulatory activity. With the exception of CSF Ig abnormalities, evidence of an immunologic process in the pathogenesis of MS points to a cellular immune mechanism. However, there remain fundamental unanswered questions concerning the nature of this process including: What is the mechanism of demyelination? What is the antigen responsible for stimulating this response and where is the antigen presented to T cells? Finally, what accounts for the fluctuating nature of the disease? Although there are no unequivocal answers to these questions, recent studies have begun to provide some insight.",

These mechanisms include antibody or other serum factors, lymphocytes, particularly cytotoxic T cells, and macrophages. The eloquent ultrastructural studies of Prineas et a/.' support the supposition that demyelination results from an interaction between myelin and macrophages. This finding is consistent with the observations that macrophages are the predominant cell population in regions of active demyelination. Importantly, macrophages that appear to be stripping myelin were shown to have coated pits. Similar associations between myelin and macrophages with coated pits were described in a relapsing form of EAE in the mouse.2 These coated pits most likely represent the migration of receptors within the macrophage membrane. Included among the receptors expressed on macrophages are those of both the Fc portion of Ig and complement. Both groups of receptors are up-regulated with activation of macrophages in sites of inflammation, particularly those associated with delayed hypersensitivity ( D T H ) reactions.",

Alternatively, complement may serve as the ligand between myelin and macrophages. Complement could certainly be fixed to antibody attached to myelin, and myelin can bind or fix complement in the absence of antibody. Macrophages express two types of complement receptors: CR 3 and CR 1.' In addition to being up-regulated on activated macrophages, the CR 1 complement receptor becomes mobile in the macrophage membrane and becomes associated with clathin-coated endocytic pits. Consequently, complement could form a bridge between macrophages and myelin by first binding to antibody-coated myelin or directly to myelin.",

Additional support for this relationship comes from studies of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection in mice.\" Neurologic signs related to demyelination occur one to several months following infection. The disease seems to be immunologically mediated, and susceptibility is influenced by the genetic makeup of the host. Genetic factors include genes in the MHC and at least one other set of genes outside the MHC and possibly coding for the beta-chain of the T-cell receptor.'\" Susceptibility to disease correlates closely with the ability to generate a DTH response to TMEV. On the basis of these observations it was proposed that T-cell recognition of virus still present within the CNS produces a DTH response that results in macrophage activation and subsequent demyelination. A process of this nature would not require persistence of infectious virus. Persistence of the viral genome and production of a single, even incomplete polypeptide that contains an epitope recognized by T cells and not antibody would be sufficient to elicit a T-cell-mediated DTH response.",

Most of these investigations used lymphoproliferation to measure reactivity, and the results were inconsistent. Recently, the generation of cytotoxic T cells (CTL) was examined in patients with MS and in appropriate control g~o u p s . '~ A substantial number of patients had a significant reduction in their ability to generate measles-virus-specific CTL. In contrast, their ability to generate influenza-virus-specific CTL was the same as that of the control groups. Previous studies of measles-virusspecific CTL showed that they are CD4+ and that cytolysis is restricted by HLA class I1 antigens. These findings are distinct from those of CTL specific for many other viruses which are predominantly CD8+ and HLA class I restricted. The reduction in measles-virus-specific CTL is due to an approximately 5-to 10-fold reduction in their precursor frequency in peripheral blood and not their total absence.\" The explanation for this finding remains uncertain. It could reflect a general reduction in a subset of CD4+, although preliminary evidence indicates that other CD4+ HLA class I1 restricted CTL are not reduced. Therefore, the alteration probably reflects a difference in the initial infection or in the mechanisms responsible for maintaining long-term immunity. It is also possible that if this population of cells was directly involved in disease production, the reduced frequency in the peripheral blood could be due to migration and sequestration of these cells within the CNS. Presently, however, there does not appear to be a correlation between the reduced measles-virus-specific CTL and the clinical course. Thus, the possibility of T-cell recognition of viral antigens in the CNS, triggering an immune response with subsequent demyelination, has remained an attractive hypothesis, but proof for it is lacking.",
