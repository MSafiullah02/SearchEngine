The score varies from 0 to 163 points, and the higher the SAPS II value, the less is the probability of survival. SOFA score is a semi-quantitative score of six organ dysfunctions, named cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, hematological, hepatic and renal dysfunctions [19]. It classifies a range of six organ dysfunctions: cardiovascular (hypotension or use of vasopressors); respiratory (PaO2/FiO2 rate); neurological (Glasgow Coma Scale); renal (serum creatinine level and/or daily diuresis); hepatic (serum bilirubin level); and hematological (platelets level). The score goes from 0 to 24 points, and it can be calculated on a daily basis, in order to evaluate the patient\u2019s improvement or worsening. SOFA also gives qualitative information about the Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS). For ease of interpretation, we also evaluated the initial SOFA score (day 1), since one score higher than 11 points is associated with less than 20 % chance of survival [20]. We also evaluated the use of vasoactive drugs, non-invasive and invasive ventilation support, and hemodialysis. We classified all ICU admission diagnoses as: respiratory insufficiency, severe sepsis or septic shock, coma/torpor and miscellaneous [21].",

            "text": "Severe immunosuppression caused by HIV infection is a known risk factor for tuberculosis [7]. As immunosuppression evolves, the TB disease spectrum changes from its classic pulmonary presentation of unilateral upper lobe infiltrate to a broad range of nonspecific signs and symptoms related to hematogenic spread of the bacillus. The myriad of presentations of TB in the population with HIV-related disease is associated with challenges in establishing the diagnosis and higher mortality [33]. Our high proportion of disseminated TB (45 %) is due to the advanced immunodeficiency status of our population, with median CD4 cell counts of 72 cells/mm3, which were lower than previously reported (109 and 112 CD4 cells/mm3) [28,29]. CD4 cell count is thought to be an unreliable predictor of ICU mortality, according to Morris and colleagues, when compared to other known risk factors, such as mechanical ventilation, low serum albumin and APACHE II score [11, 34\u201337]. However, others authors believe that CD4 cell count does have a correlation with a poorer prognosis [25, 38\u201340]. Low CD4 counts (<200 cells/mm3) have been associated with ICU mortality in HIV patients with TB [41]. In the present study, we found that patients with higher nadir CD4 cell counts were more likely to be alive six months after hospital discharge. These data are supported by the idea that CD4 cell counts at ICU admission are a better marker of long-term prognosis [42]. We preferred nadir than recent CD4 cell count because opportunistic infections and concomitant acute infections can lower the CD4 cell count [45]. Alongside with the low nadir CD4 cell count, we wanted to emphasize that we also observed a low median CD4 count close to ICU admission meaning that our population represents a profoundly immunocompromised population. Also, nadir CD4 cell count it is better marker of prognosis and disease evolution in HIV infected population [43, 44]. We also found that recent HIV diagnosis was associated with protective effect for long term survival. This variable should be evaluated with caution: there is not an accurate correlation of the moment of first HIV positive serology and the time since HIV infection began. Some patients are admitted with recent HIV diagnosis and very low nadir CD4 count, although they were previously less exposed to bacterial and multilple oportunistic infections and to the HIV infection per se, than their peers with long known HIV diagnosis and non-adherence to cART. This state of chronic immunosuppression by HIV and opportunistic infections may have contributed to a lower survival rate in this population, as shown previously in a heterogeneous group of studies with and without cART influence [11, 30, 58].",

Research suggests that patients with disseminated and extra-pulmonary forms of tuberculosis may represent a special group that may be associated with worse outcomes, including greater risk for the tuberculosis immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome [50]. TB treatment in the acute phase of critically ill patients can often be suboptimal [51, 52] because first line drugs are only available in oral formulations. One could suppose that intravenous treatment could improve outcomes (fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides). However, in this case series, we found a high proportion of critically ill patients using rifampin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide, and half of our patients received intravenous quinolones and/or aminoglycosides as the first treatment for TB with no difference in six-month survival.",

This may be different from another study, which enrolled 46 HIV-TB patients, including suspected cases of TB, although we included only confirmed cases [10]. Finally, improvements in the care of critically ill patients, such as implementation of protective ventilator strategies with low tidal volume, conservative fluid strategy for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), and early sepsis goals, have added benefits and have recently had an impact on lower mortality rates [28, 34, 55].",

All patients with GCS \u2264 11 had a lumbar puncture performed. The majority of our neurological findings were mild; most of them were classified as torpor. As shown previously, low GCS at admission can be a reliable predictor of ICU mortality [35, 58]. In our analysis, neither SOFA nor SAPS II was able to predict survival. Another two studies have found correlation between higher SAPS II and ICU mortality [35, 51]. Zahar et al. investigated laboratory-confirmed tuberculosis cases, 38 % were patients with HIV-related, all with respiratory failure, and the majority with a pulmonary presentation; higher SAPS II (approximately 45 points) and the presence of more than one organ failure were significantly associated with mortality [51]. Meybeck et al. showed that SAPS II was significantly higher in nonsurvivors (approximately 55 points) with an odds ratio of 1.05 per point [35]. The SAPS II score was similar between six-month survivors and nonsurvivors in our study, while SOFA scores on the day of ICU admission trended towards being higher in nonsurvivors (p = 0.08).",

The limited number of patients (44 patients) is another limitation of our study since we are exploring a very specific population. However, the results here presented should increase awareness to important factors that may contribute to a better management of HIV-TB patients in the ICU, and for pointing to future researches. Regarding the neurological findings, due to its retrospective nature, we were not able to detect broader neurological involvement, such as delirium and intracranial hypertension [58].
