Nipah virus causes severe disease in both humans and animals with reported the fatality rate up to 40-75% in previous outbreaks. Nipah virus (NiV) is a newly emerging virus caused a zoonotic virus of the henipavirus (HeV) genus that is normally hosted by fruit bats (natural hosts of the virus) to other species, which gets transferred from animals to humans, and it causes severe disease in both animals as well as humans [5] . The natural host of the virus is fruit bats of the \"Pteropodidae Family, Pteropus genus\". It is often carried by fruit bats to humans, infected bat secretions can also spread to domestic and wildlife animals notably pigs, human-to-human close contact with infected patients, blood or body fluid samples and contaminated raw food products and cause disease pathophysiology in vulnerable populations [5] [6] [7] . It was first identified during and reported a 1998 outbreak among pig farmers from Kampung Sungai Nipah in Malaysia and spread to Singapore with more than 100 deaths and nearly 300 human infected cases cumulatively [4] [5] [6] 8] . Previous two reported NiV outbreaks in 2001 and 2007 outbreaks claimed 50 lives in India alone, whereas Bangladesh has borne the brunt of Nipah viral disease in recent years, with more than 100 deaths out of over 600 reported human cases between 1998 and 2015 since its first outbreak reported in 2001 [5, [9] [10] [11] . The identified virus source in 2004 was reported from humans became infected with Nipah after eating date palm sap contaminated by infected fruit bats [5, 12] . So far, no case has been reported in Saudi Arabia, although some studies have revealed the presence of trace or variable species in pilgrims pre and post Hajj and Umrah [9] [10] [11] , but still no documented local case nationwide in Saudi Arabia.",

Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging arbovirus of the Flaviviridae family and is related to dengue, Chikungunya, West Nile, yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis viruses. Hajj is among the global travel gatherings, drawing between 2 and 3.5 million Muslims from 183 nations annually to perform pilgrimage in Mecca, Saudi Arabia [3] . The broad geographical range of the vector and the emerging complications of the ZIKV infection have made this flavivirus a growing global concern. This calls for constant epidemiological surveillance and a strategic response plan. Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emergent arthropod-borne flavivirus associated with neurologic complications [1] . The first reports of human disease were described in Uganda and Tanzania during an outbreak in 1952 [1, 3, 13] . On February 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Zika virus infection a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) due to the increasing number of cases and its associated complications. Currently, ZIKV is responsible for the ongoing outbreaks in the Caribbean and South America following the initial outbreak in Brazil [2] . The primary route of human ZIKV transmission is through the bite of mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and Ae. Albopictus in tropical and temperate regions [13] [14] [15] . ZIKV is also transmitted via transfusion of blood products, organ transplantation and congenitally, laboratory exposure, sexual and, vertical maternal-fetal transmission [16, 17] . After an incubation period of 2-14days, patients develop an acute febrile syndrome asso-ciated with unspecific symptoms such as headaches, arthralgia, pruritic rash, no purulent conjunctivitis, myalgia, anorexia, asthenia, dysesthesia and retro-orbital pain [1, 15, 17, 18] . Despite the low frequency of fatalities and hospitalization due to severe disease, ZIKV infection is associated with a high frequency of neurologic complications such as congenital microcephaly and Guillain-Barre syndrome.",

Along with this syndrome, ZIKV is also associated with a higher rate of pregnancy loss and stillbirths among infected women. Congenital ZIKV syndrome may include microcephaly, ventriculomegaly, intracranial calcifications, extra-axial fluid, decreased brain parenchymal volume, lissencephaly, cerebellar hypoplasia, impairment of normal brain development in the fetus, delayed myelination and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum [21] [22] [23] . Fetus to newborns of infected mothers can develop cardiac anomalies with septum defects, hearing loss, seizures due to the underlying brain malformations, neuromotor abnormalities such as spasticity and feeding difficulties and ocular abnormalities requires population-based screening and identification of asymptomatic infected or susceptible individuals [2, 3, 24, 25] .",

Frontline health workers were few, lacked skills and logistic support to handle infected cases, making them 21-30 times at higher risk of being infected than the general adult population6. Poor infrastructure impeded transport of cases and samples, while porous borders made crossborder contact tracing difficult [1, 2, [27] [28] [29] . Fear and superstition among affected populations, and lack of understanding community perceptions, customs and practices, impeded implementation of effective disease containment policies including safe burial practices [2] . More, lacking the 'One Health' approach creates poor linkage between the animal, wildlife and environmental health surveillance systems [29] . Therefore, routine information and alert warning signals do not exist and not share, delaying effective response coupled with limited or lack of financing of routine surveillance and preventive actions, also weak existing capacities to reactive response [2, 29, 33] .",
