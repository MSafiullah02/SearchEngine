Many Eucalyptus species are renowned for their fast growth rate, the straight shape of their trunks, valuable wood properties, wide adaptability to soils and climates, resistance to biotic stresses, and ease of management through coppicing, seed or clonal propagation. Especially in Brazil, Chile, South Africa, Portugal and India, Eucalyptus timber is widely used for cellulose pulp and paper production. The Eucalyptus species and hybrids most employed in commercial plantations and breeding programs in the tropics include E. grandis, E. urophylla, E. globulus and E. saligna (FAO 2001).",

Reverse transcription followed by real-time, quantitative PCR (RT\u2013qPCR) is the most sensitive and specific technique commonly used to assess gene expression levels (Aerts et al. 2004). It allows more in-depth studies of smaller sets of genes across many individuals, treatments or cell/tissue types to be performed.

            "text": "As mentioned previously, only good internal reference genes will allow confident comparison of gene expression results. Internal control genes are used to normalize mRNA fractions and are often referred to as housekeeping genes which should not vary their expression during development, among tissues or cells under investigation, or in response to experimental treatments. The most common housekeeping genes employed in plant gene expression studies are those encoding actin (Bas et al. 2004, Barsalobres-Cavallari et al. 2009), tubulin (Schmidt and Delaney 2010, Yang et al. 2010), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Tong et al. 2009, Maroufi et al. 2010), rRNA (Gu\u00e9nin et al. 2009, Schimidt and Delaney 2010, Yang et al. 2010), polyubiquitin (Libault et al. 2008, Barsalobres-Cavallari et al. 2009) and elongation factor 1\u03b1 (Silveira et al. 2009, Tong et al. 2009). Many studies make use of these housekeeping genes without proper validation of their presumed stability, based on the assumption that they would be constitutively expressed due to their role in basic cellular processes. Considerable amounts of data show that most studied housekeeping genes have expression that can vary considerably depending on the cell type or experimental condition (Thellin et al. 1999, Hruz et al. 2011). With the increased sensitivity, reproducibility and large dynamic range of the RT\u2013qPCR methods, the requirements for proper internal control genes have become increasingly stringent.",

Reference genes for gene expression studies in Eucalyptus have been recently presented. de Almeida et al. (2010), working with E. globulus microccuttings rooted in vitro, have indicated histone H2B and \u03b1-tubulin as the most suitable reference genes during in vitro adventitious rooting, in the presence or absence of auxin. Boava et al. (2010), working with clonal seedlings of the hybrid plant (E. grandis\u00d7E. urophylla) exposed to biotic (Puccinia psidii) or abiotic (acibenzolar-S-methyl) stresses, concluded that genes encoding the eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) and ubiquitin were the most stable, and ideal as internal controls. Both studies tested a small number of genes (11 and 13, respectively) selected according to literature data concerning other plant systems and experimental conditions.",

Best candidate genes were then validated by RT\u2013qPCR in assays with RNAs from xylem and leaves of six Eucalyptus species and flowers of E. grandis. Seven traditional housekeeping genes most employed in expression studies in plants were also included in our analysis. The Eucalyptus species selected in the present study are among the most planted trees in the tropics and the most employed in breeding programs in Brazil (E. grandis, E. urophylla, E. globulus, E. saligna, E. dunnii and E. pellita). Most importantly, they exhibit highly contrasting phenotypes, especially in growth rate, biotic and abiotic resistance and wood quality (FAO 2001, Coppen 2002), which, in principle, would make the search for general reference genes for the genus difficult. As a result, genes selected as the least variable among all conditions tested have not yet been described in the literature. This set of genes may represent an important molecular tool to analyze accurately the expression of Eucalyptus genes in different tissues/organs and in different species via array hybridization or RT\u2013qPCR.",

The microarray study was conceived with nine 50-mer oligoprobes covering the length of each one of the 21,432 unique sequences derived from the Genolyptus expressed sequence tag (EST) data set (GenBank accession Nos. HO763666\u2013HO769458 and HS047685\u2013HS075494). Nine oligoprobes were also designed for 10 cDNAs encoding known human proteins as negative controls. Oligoprobes were synthesized \u2018on-chip\u2019 in duplicate, randomly distributed in two blocks of 10 identical slides. Leaf blades and vascular (xylem) tissue samples were taken from two E. grandis clonal trees, i.e. derived from the same matrix tree and harboring the same genotype. Two additional xylem samples were collected from two other E. grandis clonal trees of a different genotype and from two E. globulus clonal trees. Therefore, 10 Cy3-labeled cDNA samples and 10 identical chips were produced at Roche NimbleGen for the microarray assays, with a total number of 385,956 features per slide [microarray results were submitted to Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession Nos.

It uses repeated permutations of the data to determine if the expression of any gene is significantly related to the response. The cut-off for significance is determined by a tuning parameter delta, chosen by the user based on the false-positive rate. One can also choose a fold change parameter, to ensure that called genes change at least a pre-specified amount. In the present study, the value of delta was set to 0.2 so that we could mine the genes whose expression exhibited the lowest variation among the three conditions assessed in the microarrays, i.e. E. grandis leaves and xylem and E. globulus xylem (Fig. 1A). A ranking of 50 genes whose fold change values were approximately equal to 1 were selected as reference candidate genes, since they presented the lowest variation of expression among the leaves and xylem of E. grandis and xylem of E. globulus (Table 1).\n",

SDMA allowed us to generate a 3D graph that evidenced genes expressed in a position equivalent to their overall average expression among the three conditions analyzed in the microarrays (Fig. 1B). The average value of gene expression by SDMA should be as similar as possible to the global average of expression, and the overall standard deviation should tend to zero when the scope of the analysis is the selection of genes whose expression is stable. Using the same criteria applied in SAM, we selected 50 genes whose standard deviations were close to zero, indicating the similarity between the values of mean and mean global gene expression (Table 1). An SDMA 3D graphic is presented in Fig. 1C where the mean expression values of the 50 most stable genes selected under the conditions studied are plotted. Note that points representing selected genes tend to form a straight line, indicating that their means of expression when compared with the global average have a standard deviation tending to zero.",

Nonetheless, just one housekeeping gene is determined to all samples using NormFinder when no groups are defined. So, a different group was created to analyze the most stable couple (Table 3).

In higher plants, IPP and DMAPP are synthesized through two distinct pathways in separate cellular compartments, the cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) pathway and the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway that takes place in plastids. The MEP pathway, through which diterpenes are synthesized, has two important initial steps: (i) the formation of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) from pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate through the action of the DXP synthase (DXS), followed by the conversion of DXP into MEP by the action of the DXP reductoisomerase (DXR). As DXS and DXR are key enzymes catalyzing the two committed steps for isoprenoid biosynthesis, genes coding for DXS and DXR may play important roles in controlling the plastidic synthesis of isoprenoids and the downstream diterpene products (Carretero-Paulet et al. 2002, Liao et al. 2007, Wu et al. 2009, Yan et al. 2009).",

This enzyme and its encoding mRNA show increased expression in inflorescences and leaves of A. thaliana (Carretero-Paulet et al. 2002) and Salvia miltiorrhiza (Yan et al. 2009), but decreased levels were reported in stems and roots. In Rauvolfia veticillata, on the other hand, higher levels of dxr mRNA were reported in fruits and roots, with the lowest levels in flowers (Liao et al. 2007). In order to confirm the constitutive expression of the three best Eucalyptus genes selected as references (Eucons04, Eucons08 and Eucons21), we tested them by normalizing the patterns of dxr gene expression in Eucalyptus and compared the results with those normalized by the traditional reference genes RibL23A and GAPDH. Therefore, the expression of dxr and the reference genes was measured by RT\u2013qPCR in the same set of tissues/organs and Eucalyptus species previously tested. dxr expression values were then normalized against the expression values of two reference genes, as shown in Fig. 4.\n",

As expected, steady-state mRNA levels for the dxr gene were much higher in leaves, followed by flowers, with lower values observed in xylem tissues of E. grandis (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4, the pairwise combination of Eucons04, Eucons08 or Eucons21 allowed more confident results than the RibL23A/GAPDH pair. The relative expression of the dxr gene was much less variable when normalized with Eucons genes and, most importantly, much more concordant if compared with results normalized by the RibL23A/GAPDH pair. This is more evident in Fig. 4B where no statistical difference was observed in dxr relative expression values among the xylem from E. grandis, E. globulus and E. pellita when RibL23A/GAPDH were used as references, but was quite different when normalized with any two of the Eucons genes. Essentially the same conclusions were assumed by the analysis of dxr relative expression obtained with leaves and xylem tissues from E. dunnii, E. pellita, E. saligna and E. urophylla (results not shown).",

Therefore, the ideal reference gene should exhibit invariable expression levels among all different cell types, tissues, organs, developmental stages or treatments that are submitted to the test organism (Vandesompele et al. 2002, Andersen et al. 2004). However, it has become clear that no single gene is constitutively expressed in all cell types and under all experimental conditions. It has been shown extensively that the expression of the so-called \u2018housekeeping\u2019 genes, although constant under some experimental conditions, can vary quite considerably in other cases, implying that the expression stability of the intended control gene has to be verified before each experiment (Thellin et al. 1999, Volkov et al. 2003, Czechowski et al. 2005, Gutierrez et al. 2008, Gu\u00e9nin et al. 2009, Hruz et al. 2011).

According to our RT\u2013qPCR results and data analysis by geNorm and NormFinder, all these housekeeping genes showed quite consistent stability in expression in Eucalyptus, especially RibL23A (Fig. 3, Table 3). Nevertheless, the employment of the pair GAPDH/RibL23A to normalize the expression of the isoprenoid biosynthetic gene dxr proved that, at least together, these genes are not suitable as references for Eucalyptus gene expression studies. Indeed, the combination of any pair of the three best reference genes here presented, Eucons04, 08 and 21, to normalize the results of dxr gene expression was intrinsically consistent, leading to a quite different interpretation of the dxr gene expression in xylem tissues of three Eucalyptus species, as shown in Fig. 4B.",

Analysis of the Eucalyptus microarray and RT\u2013qPCR data revealed that, indeed, it has a quite stable expression. Nevertheless, this gene is far from being the best reference for Eucalyptus among those tested (Fig. 3, Table 3). TUA2 has been shown to be a suitable normalization gene during plant development in Orobanche ramosa (Gonz\u00e1lez-Verdejo et al. 2008), for comparison of gene expressions among species of Populus (Brunner et al. 2004), and during E. globulus adventitious rooting in vitro (de Almeida et al. 2010), but it was unstable during seedling development in A. thaliana (Volkov et al. 2003, Hong et al. 2010, Zhou et al. 2010), in different tissues or under biotic and abiotic stresses in potato (Nicot et al. 2005) and cucumber (Wan et al. 2010). Similar results were also obtained by Artico et al. (2010) in cotton, Silveira et al. (2009) in Brachyaria brizantha, and Exp\u00f3sito-Rodr\u00edguez et al. (2008) and Dekkers et al. (2012) for A. thaliana and tomato seeds.",

According to Kim et al. (2003), the relative expression of GAPDH in rice varied up to 2-fold. In Brachypodium distachyon, results of RT\u2013qPCR showed that the GAPDH gene was stably expressed under various abiotic stresses, without considerable variation in response to growth hormones, although it exhibited less stability according to the tissue type being evaluated (Hong et al. 2008). In tomato, GAPDH was poorly ranked as a good reference gene based on the analysis of EST data (Coker and Davies 2003) and RT\u2013qPCR assays during plant development (Exp\u00f3sito-Rodr\u00edguez et al. 2008) or under abiotic stress (L\u00f8vdal and Lillo 2009). Similar results were obtained with peach, where GAPDH was not among the best reference genes in the experimental groups (Tong et al. 2009). According to Tong et al. (2009), the reasons for the observed discrepancies may be that GAPDH not only acts as a component of the glycolytic pathway but also takes part in other processes. Therefore, the expression profile of GAPDH might fluctuate according to the corresponding experimental conditions.",

Nevertheless, members of this gene family were shown to have extraribosomal functions with strong variations in the pattern of their expression (Wool 1996, McIntosh et al. 2005). For instance, these genes were shown to be specifically induced or repressed in particular tissues during different stages such as tuber (Taylor et al. 1992) and root (Williams and Sussex 1995) development; or in response to stresses such as genotoxicity (Revenkova et al. 1999) and cold (Saez-Vasquez et al. 2000, Kim et al. 2004). Volkov et al. (2003) specifically evaluated the tissue-specific changes in the RibL23A mRNA levels in different organs of A. thaliana. Compared with leaves, the level of RibL23A mRNA was increased in flowers and reduced in stems and siliques. These observations are in accordance with the idea that ribosomal protein genes in plants are transcriptionally up-regulated in actively growing tissues and down-regulated in metabolically inactive tissues (Marty et al. 1993, Moran 2000). Interestingly, among the traditional housekeeping genes tested in the present work, RibL23A was the most stable, only outperformed by the Eucons genes discussed later.",

Considering that two statistical programs allowed us to reach similar interpretations of the microarray results, and that potential discrepancies should be expected, the good agreement of our results with the independent approaches strongly suggested that Eucons04, Eucons08 and Eucons21 should be regarded as tne most suitable reference genes for normalization of gene expression studies in Eucalyptus species. Although the selected reference genes were tested only in six species of a genus with >700 species, these six species represent some of the most widely planted trees in the tropics (FAO 2001) and exhibit quite a large variation in growth rate, stress resistance and wood quality (Coppen 2002). To our knowledge, the present work represents the widest in-depth study developed to validate optimal reference genes for the evaluation of transcript levels in different eucalypt organs and species.

Ten cDNAs encoding known human proteins were also included in chips as negative controls. Nine oligonucleotides, 50 bp long, distributed throughout each sequence and with close melting temperatures were designed and synthesized for each sequence consensus or singleton. Probes were randomly distributed on two blocks of each chip in duplicated form, adding up to 385,856 features per chip. Therefore, each chip was composed of two blocks (technical replicates) containing the same collection of randomly distributed probes, and 18 hybridization values were collected for each gene from every chip. A total of 10 identical chips were produced. Two chips were hybridized with cDNA samples from E. grandis mature leaves, and eight chips were destined to xylem cDNA hybridizations. After submission of total RNA samples to NimbleGen, prepared as described above, cDNAs were labeled with Cy3, and hybridizations, washing, scanning, data collection and initial data normalization were performed according to NimbleGen's standard protocols.",

SDMA is the acronym for Standard Deviation Microarray Analysis. The formal statement of SDMA can be defined as follows: let G = {g1, g2, g3,\u2026, gm} be a set of genes. Let H = {h1, h2, h3,\u2026, ho} be a set of hybridizations, where o \u2265 2. Let M = {T1, T2, T3,\u2026, Tn} be a set of tissues, where n \u2265 2 and each element T contains a set of hybridizations such that T \u2282 H, and Tx \u22c2 Ty = \u00d8 for any x \u2260 y. Let Ehp = {Ehp_g1, Ehp_g2, Ehp_g3,\u2026, Ehp_gm} be a set of expressions levels of m genes in hp hybridization, where p \u2264 o.Let Avg(Tpgq) be the average of expression levels of gene q over all hybridizations from tissue p. Let Sd(gq) be the standard deviation of gene q considering Avg(T1gq), Avg(T2gq), Avg(T3gq),\u2026 and Avg(Tngq). Sdg can assume any value from 0 until \u221e. Sdgq is equal to zero when Avg(T1gq) = Avg(T2gq) = Avg(T3gq) = \u2026 = Avg(Tngq), i.e. the gene q has exactly the same expression level in all tissues. The value of Sdgq increases proportionally to growth of difference among Avg(T1gq), Avg(T2gq), Avg(T3gq),\u2026 and Avg(Tngq). So, SDMA can rank the n most similarly expressed, i.e. those n genes for which Sdg is closer to zero.",

There was a set of 20 hybridizations, i.e. H = {h1, h2, h3,\u2026, h20}, where T1 = {h1, h2, h3, h4}, T2 = {h5, h6,\u2026, h12} and T3 = {h13, h14,\u2026, h20}. We also considered SDg as the standard deviation of expression levels of a gene g in T1, T2 and T3. Moreover, microarray expression data were scaled into log10 intensity values. It resulted in values for expression levels from 4.66 to 5.20. The SDMA approach ranked the genes according to their similarities in expression levels in the three distinct tissues.
