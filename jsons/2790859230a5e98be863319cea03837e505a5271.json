Understandings the profile of virus in patients' respiratory specimens can assist diagnosis and reflect the disease course. Therefore, we collected clinical specimens from 56 COVID-19 patients and reported the results of SARS-CoV-2 detection during the disease course. reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N), were tested during the real-time RT-PCR assay. If two consecutive negative results were achieved, the period between symptoms onset and the date of first negative RT-PCR test result was defined as viral nucleic acid conversion time. All data (test dates and results of RT-PCR assay) were collected up to the final follow-up date (March 3 rd , 2020).",

            "text": "Our study attempted to explore the correlation between clinical characteristics and viral shedding in COVID-19 patients. We found that patients with prolonged viral nucleic acid conversion tend to be older and with more comorbidities. Previous studies suggested that coronavirus is more likely to infect older individuals, for whom the immunopathogenesis and induction of a proinflammatory cytokine storm might be the culprit. [12] Older patients with impaired immune function might have a prolonged period of viral elimination. 6 As a result of errors in sampling and testing, false negative result of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 is very common in clinical settings. Meanwhile, it is recommended by the current diagnosis and treatment guideline for SARS-CoV-2 from Chinese National Health Committee that the criteria to discharge a patient included the relief of symptoms, improvement in radiography and two consecutive negative RT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2. [7] In our study we found two consecutive negative RT-PCR test results followed by a positive result in 4 patients (patient number 20, 24, 37 and 56). Evidence suggested that the outbreaks of COVID-19 may be correlated to its rapid person-toperson transmission ability. [2] Since specific treatment had not been validated for COVID-19, traditional public health tactics-isolation, quarantine and community containment are critical to control the spread. [14] [15] [16] This preliminary study has found evidence of the dynamic profile of SARS-CoV-2 in non-ICU COVID-19 patients during disease course. According to the results in our study, we suggested prolonged observation and repeat confirmation of RT-PCR test from respiratory specimens for safe discharges and discontinuation of quarantine.",

All enrolled patients were confirmed diagnosed of COVID-19 according to the diagnosis and treatment guideline for SARS-CoV-2 from Chinese National Health Committee (Version 5) and the interim guidance from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. [6-7] Throat swab samples or deep nasal cavity swab samples were collected from patients on different dates after the onset of symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 were detected by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay using a COVID-19 nucleic acid detection kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Shanghai Huirui Biotechnology Co., Ltd).

Our preliminary results are notable for providing evidence of SARS-CoV-2 dynamic profile in patients infected. Genomic studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 shared around 80% identity sequencing with SARS-CoV, which caused a global epidemic with 8096 confirmed cases worldwide in 2002-2003. [8] Presumed person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was suggested based on epidemiology and clinical evidences. [9, 10] Although SARS-CoV-2 share similar sequencing characteristics with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, study of case series suggested the viral nucleic acid shedding pattern of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 is different from SARS-CoV, which had a modest viral loads in the early stage and peaked approximately 10 days after symptoms onset. [11] Our study collected series RT-PCR test results from 56 recovered COVID-19 patients and investigate the dynamic profile during the disease course. We showed majority of patients got positive results of RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 within 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms. The negative results of RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 began dominant from week 4 after onset of symptoms and by the end of follow-up (6 weeks), all results of RT-PCR test were negative.
