They are part of an actual science problem solving process: By playing, players help scientists, and thereby interact with real continuous research processes. This mixes the two worlds of play and science in new ways. During usability testing we discovered that users of the crowdscience game Quantum Dreams tended to answer questions in game terms, even when directed explicitly to give science explanations. We then examined these competing frames of understanding through a mixed correlational and grounded theory analysis. This essay presents the core ideas of crowdscience games as learning opportunities, and reports how a group of players used \"game\", \"science\" and \"conceptual\" frames to interpret their experience. Our results suggest that oscillating between the frames instead of sticking to just one led to the 30",

We then discuss the challenge of having mixed epistemic frames in the play experience: The immediate game interface on one hand, and the science process on the other. When used in a classroom setting, a third frame, learning and education, is also added. This conundrum is unpacked through a grounded and correlational analysis of 38 players' interpretations of interfaceelements in Quantum Dreams. The fact that many players seemed to place focus on either game or science surfaced during pragmatic perusing of usability test data, and was turned into a more formal analysis for the sake of this essay.",

This became a theme in worker's rights. In 1888 hundreds of trade unionists thus paraded through Worchester Massachusetts bearing a banner that read \"eight hours for work, eight hours for rest, eight hours for what we will.\" Workers wanted opportunities for recreation (Ashby, 2006) . Together with the technological possibilities that first gave us dime novels, cheap sheet music and nickel theaters, this can be viewed as a cornerstone in western culture and its entertainment industry that would lead to the rise of cinema, flow-TV and eventually computer games. As gaming progressed from niche market to mobile mass movement, a new age of casual gaming arose. In the new millennium, women over 30 would be the most rapidly expanding consumer group for years on end, and gaming moved from high-investment titles on stationary screens to little pauses in life (Juul, 2010; Software Entertainment Association (ESA), 2013; Wei & Huffaker, 2012) . We are experiencing an unparalleled acceptance of play into everyday life -a ludification of culture (Raessens, 2006 ) and a cognitive surplus which can be put toward informal education and interesting problem solving (Shirky, 2010) .",

For instance, our early game Quantum Moves required quite a bit of training before users could traverse the difficult levels that represented truly wicked problems in building our quantum computer, compared to how new users can contribute to Galaxy Zoo straight away, even if they may become more speedy and precise with practice .",

We suggest that crowd science games supply an advantage with regard to this challenge, as there is less disjunction between the medium and the science matter -the context and the content are both scientific, and accumulating data demonstrates that this attracts people with just a casual interest in e.g. quantum physics to corresponding games. The crowd science game supplies a genuine opportunity for legitimate peripheral participation (as per Lave & Wenger, 1991) in the scientific process. User engagement may be bolstered through the gameplay itself, or as is often seen via a wider ecology of knowledge of information, interesting quizzes, social milieus, and even opportunities to co-create the game itself.",

Viewing crowd science games through the standard motivational frameworks (Huizenga, Admiraal, Akkerman, & Ten Dam, 2009; R. M. Ryan, Rigby, & Przybylski, 2006; Wouters, van Nimwegen, van Oostendorp, & van der Spek, 2013) and player types (Hamari & Tuunanen, 2014) offers some useful design heuristics and measuring tools, but this only seems to paint half the picture. Dropout and conversion rates in Quantum Moves resembled most free to play games (i.e. Draganov, 2014; Fields, 2014) , but deeper analyses from Galaxy Zoo and The Milky Way Project revealed that engagement profiles could be sorted into types ranging from briefly hardworking, over moderate, to lasting categories, which cannot simply be boiled down to gameplay (Ponciano, Brasileiro, Simpson, & Smith, 2014) . Indeed, recent research has shown that framing the same activity as either game or work irrespective of the game elements used can have a measurable psychological impact in terms of interest and enjoyment in the short term (Lieberoth, 2014b) . Accordingly, interview studies have shown that while game elements attract new users to citizen science platforms, they are less of a factor in sustained engagement (Iacovides, Jennett, Cornish-Trestrail, & Cox, 2013; Lieberoth et al., 2014) Framing thus seems to be a central issue: If players view a crowd science game only in comparison with other online games, they will often be disappointed. However, if part of their interest stems from or shifts to intrinsic motivation related to taking part in the science project, then play and science frames can merge into a new level of enjoyable experiences. To understand a well played citizen science game, we must thus try to understand not just the raw game play, but also the meta-motivational frame under which the activity unfolds, and how this shapes players' interpretation of the game elements.",

            "text": "To put the discussion presented above under scrutiny, we examined user experiences in the crowd science game Quantum Dreams. Quantum computers offer immense computational speedup compared to conventional computers by replacing bit, which can be either 0 or 1, with qubits. These can be both 0 and 1 at the same time. Thus, a quantum computer with N qubits can represent 2N different values at the same time, allowing an exponential increase in the computing power for certain tasks (Nielsen & Chuang, 2000) . Our approach is to build a quantum computer from ultra-cold atoms in an optical lattice (Weitenberg, Kuhr, M\u00f8lmer, & Sherson, 2011) . The individual atoms are transported around the lattice by optical tweezers. However, when moved the atoms begin to slosh -similar to coffee in a cup if you are not careful. Computer algorithms are only capable of solving the problem of transporting the atom without sloshing, if given enough time. To investigate whether humans given the right visual tools can form heuristic algorithms to find fast solutions to the complex quantum problem of moving a single atom without sloshing, we built the game Quantum Dreams in the Unity game engine. Quantum Dreams represents a simple 3D game loop based on the more complex levels in our less smooth game Quantum Moves (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2015; Lieberoth et al., 2014 , Magnussen, Hansen, Planke & Sherson, 2014 , Bjaelde, Pedersen & Sherson., 2014 . Contrary to most crowd science games, Quantum Dreams is not only embedded in the project homepage, but also lives its own life on online app stores with minimal background information. Our \"micropayment\" is scientific data rather than money. In the game, the players are asked to collect an atom with an optical tweezer and transport it to a target area. A more detailed metagameplay will supporting other play experiences and educational content follow in later iterations. The GUI resembles Guitar Hero with the player controlling a little flying robot with the mouse flying \"into the screen\". When a yellow shining substance (figure 1, number 4) appears, the robot can be moved to grab it and ferry it carefully across the screen to hit targets that appear further down the \"road\" (figure 1, number 3). The yellow substance represents a probability distribution of where the atom might be, and the robot controls the optical tweezer. Since atoms in the quantum computer are quite fragile, they must be moved quickly and carefully, or they might be lost due to excitations to high energy states (S\u00f8rensen et al., 2015) . The game is thus one of fine motor coordination and quickly gleaning the best speed and route, before the robot reaches each target. By repeatedly moving the probability distribution into new target areas during game play, the player helps us map out the best routes in corresponding spaces in the actual quantum computer. The game itself has a technological sciency feel, but the quantum narrative is largely left out of the core loop gameplay itself.",

In his seminal work on the subject Erving Goffman (1976) often cites game play as clear example of how people submit to rules and conventions that transform otherwise meaningless actions, such as moving a checkers piece, into significant events within the shared frame of \"play\". Engrossment into frames oscillates, so as conversation fluxes you might shift attention from meanings within the game, to preserving a friendly relationship with your opponent, and back again (Fine, 1983) . Frameworks thus delimit mental and practical situations wherein differing \"habits of mind\" or \"modes of thinking\" (Kuhn, 2008) come to the fore. As Quantum Dreams was introduced to our test population in the context of their vocational school, and events started out with a talk on physics, the primary frame of interpretation would have been \"education\" or \"science\" for most. The introduction of the highly gamelike GUI, however, keyed (as per Goffman, 1976 ) a swing to \"gaming\" from which some were not able to shift back. The questions, apart from finding out if the testers enjoyed the game, were thus: Did they remember any physics information? And how do the frames of gaming and science coexist for the players in a simple game experience like this? Participants 38 Danish students (age 14-22, M=17.27, all male) were recruited to play as part of their vocational school (HTX) training. The participants can be described as heavy gamers, with 30 of them reporting playing 10+ hours/week, with high interest in physics (M = 3.74 SD = .852, on a scale 1-5).",

Here, interest/enjoyment is taken to be a main measure of intrinsic motivation stemming from the activity in and of itself, while the other scales are taken to be contributing factors, namely how much the student finds scientific/ educational meaning in the activity, how well they feel that they can do (i.e. mastery) and the degree to which they have flexibility and choice in the participation trajectory. The shorter learning orientation measures in English mastery (3 items, \u03b1 = .285), performance: approach (3 items, \u03b1 = .794), and performance: avoidance (3 items, \u03b1 = .529) were adapted from the Patterns of Adaptive Learning Scales (PALS) (Midgley et al., 2005) . These scales are taken to indicate the degree to which learners prefer work that allows for growth through exploration and even constructive failures (mastery) versus just doing well by some objective measure and avoiding looking bad in the eyes of oneself and one's peers (approach/avoid). The scales were supplemented with a series of individual questions mainly used for parts of usability testing that are not reported here.

But these findings are also a somber reminder that game thinking can be distracting, even when students are explicitly asked to focus on the science explanations. All things considered, many students never supplied any science descriptions, likely owing to the fact that this usability study was not run as part of a continuous educational plan for quantum physics. The pedagogies surrounding any game deployment is likely to be the main contributing factor to student learning, while a game like Quantum Dream supplies a first hand experience with the behavior of atoms in quantum space, which is very hard to grasp even for trained scientists.",
