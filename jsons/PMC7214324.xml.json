Since, the ACE2/angiotensin 1-7 axis can be effective in protecting the lung from developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as a main complication of coronaviruses, recently, the recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2; APN01, GSK2586881) has received a lot of attention [17,18]. With regards to previous studies, administration of rhACE2, which is purified from the supernatant of ACE2 transfected cells, can reduce plasma angiotensin II and increase plasma angiotensin 1\u20137 and shows the ability to prevent angiotensin II\u2013induced myocardial hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, and myocardial fibrosis [19].",

Also, it can prevent the lung from injury not only by neutralizing the virus but also release cellular ACE2 and enhance its activity. Extensive animal experimental research has shown that rhACE2 could attenuate severe acute lung injury in ACE2-deficient mice [20,21]. In human studies, it has been found that rhACE2 is safe, with no adverse effects in patients with ARDS and healthy volunteers [[22], [23], [24]]. Interestingly, the results of a pilot study showed that the infusion of rhACE2 tends to decrease the interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentration in patients with ARDS [23]. Recent investigations reported the increased level of IL-6 in patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and it has been shown that the level of IL-6 has a positive correlation with the severity of the disease [25,26]. Considering the importance of inflammatory cytokines modulation in patients with COVID-19, the rhACE2 may be regarded as a promising therapeutic option.",

Some compounds which directly bind to ACE2 receptor with high affinity can be suggested for competition with virus including morphine and codeine [27]. Morphine has been traditionally used for severe pain control and in anesthesia. Morphine as an analgesic drug and a natural opioid mediate their effects via three receptors termed \u03bc, \u03b4, and \u03ba opioid receptors [28,29]. This opiate alkaloid (C17H19NO3) isolated firstly from the plant papaver somniferum (the opium poppy) and can produce synthetically nowadays. Based on AutoDock Vina data (molecular screening modeling for protein-ligand docking), it was assumed that morphine (\u22126.6 kcal/mol) and especially codeine or methyl-morphine (C18H21NO3; \u22127 kcal/mol) be more effective compounds with high affinity for directly binding to ACE2 receptor (docking score < -10 kcal/mol) [27].",

            "text": "Beyond all these, overwhelming evidence indicates elevated level of some inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3), IL-6, etc.) in COVID-19 infected patients [32]. This overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines or cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) may cause more damage to the host cells than the SARS-CoV-2 as a foreign invader [33]. Experimental investigations showed that morphine treatment significantly suppressed some inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IFNs and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) as well alleviated hyper-inflammatory status [34,35]. Since elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines increased viral replication in bronchoalveolar; modulation of systemic immune responses by morphine may have a potential role in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 [36]. Also, it has been suggested that opioids such as morphine can regulate immune function through the central nervous system. This opinion perhaps provides new insight into the clinical treatment of severe patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 by inhibitory compounds of ACE2 receptor such as morphine and codeine. Generally, it should be noted that, using morphine and codeine in treating COVID-19 is only hypothetical and is based on the unpublished docking screening study [27,30]. Furthermore, morphine may cause sedation and respiratory depression [36].",
