Reports concerned the incidence of both clinically and laboratory-confirmed influenza and influenzalike illnesses and also acute respiratory tract infections, according to the criteria set for the surveillance of influenza in the EU. Virological diagnostic tests were performed in the laboratories of the Provincial Sanitary and Epidemiological Stations and were verified in the NIPH-NIH within the influenza surveillance Sentinel and non-Sentinel systems. The tests were performed on clinical samples collected by primary care physicians from patients suspected of being infected with influenza and influenza-like viruses. Molecular methods were employed to define the genetic viral material. The genetic material was isolated from 200 \u03bcL pharyngeal swab specimens suspended in physiological saline or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).

To this end, a quadrivalent vaccine, consisting of two antigens of influenza A subtypes and another two of type B virus, was introduced in Poland as of the 2017/2018 season. Nonetheless, the vaccination rate remained at a dismal level, one of the lowest in Europe, fluctuating between 3% and 4% of the general Polish population.
