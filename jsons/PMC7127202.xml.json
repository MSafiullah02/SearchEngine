            "text": "Enterovirus 71 (EV71), first isolated in 1969 in California, is a major public health issue across the Asia Pacific region, Europe, and other continents. The virus mostly affects young children and causes hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), which is generally a mild illness characterized by blisters and ulcers (Cardosa et al., 2003, McMinn, 2002, Solomon et al., 2010, Wu et al., 2010). However, unlike other HFMD pathogens, such as the Coxsackie virus and echovirus, EV71 infection could result in severe neurologic complications, including aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis, myocarditis, pulmonary edema, and hemorrhage, with high incidence of fatality (Chang et al., 2007, Huang et al., 1999). EV71 was recently reported as the primary pathogen of HFMD among young children in China (Yang et al., 2009, Zhang et al., 2009), and over 1.77 million HFMD cases were reported in 2010, 905 of which were fatal. This number is a 53.6% increase from that reported in 2009, during which over 1.15 million cases were reported and 353 cases were fatal (Ministry of Health, PR China).",

The EV71 genome, which is approximately 7.4 kb long, encodes a long polyprotein with a single open reading frame followed by a poly A tail. The single polyprotein is flanked by untranslated regions at both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends, and can be divided into 3 different genomic regions. The P1 genomic region encodes for structural proteins (VP1 to VP4), while the P2 and P3 genomic regions encode for nonstructural proteins 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D (Cardosa et al., 2003, Solomon et al., 2010, Wu et al., 2010). Research on EV71 drugs and vaccines is ongoing and some progress has been achieved (reviewed by Lee and Chang, 2010, Wu et al., 2010), and the potential receptors for EV71 infection were also identified (Nishimura et al., 2009, Yamayoshi et al., 2009). However, an effective drug or vaccine against EV71 infection is currently unavailable. Thus, determination of the pathogen of HFMD for an early treatment is desirable.",

            "text": "Recently, a novel method of DNA amplification, known as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) of a target nucleic acid, was reported by Notomi et al. (2000). LAMP is a 1-step amplification reaction that amplifies a target DNA sequence with high sensitivity and specificity under isothermal conditions by a DNA polymerase (Bst polymerase) and a set of primers. The addition of reverse transcriptase makes it possible to amplify DNA from RNA sequences (RT-LAMP). This method has already been applied to the detection of several RNA viruses, such as Norovirus (Iturriza-Gomara et al., 2008), avian influenza virus H5N1 (Imai et al., 2006, Imai et al., 2007), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Poon et al., 2005). Here we sought to determine whether or not RT-LAMP could be applied to EV71 amplification and determine its diagnostic performance in clinical specimens.",

The extracted RNA was amplified by RT-LAMP, and the reaction solution was run with agarose gel. The products amplified by the RT-LAMP assay exhibited a typical ladder-like pattern on electrophoresis, indicating the formation of stem-loop DNA with inverted repeats (Fig. 2A). To confirm the amplification by RT-LAMP, the amplified products were detected by Southern blot with VP1 gene as the probe and the results showed a signal pattern similar to that obtained from electrophoresis (Fig. 2B). Three significant bands (marked in Fig. 2A) were purified and cloned into a T vector for sequencing; the results also showed that the sequences are conclusive for the VP1 gene (Fig. 2C).",

It is hard to be accepted by those small and condition-limited infirmaries in a developing country.

However, up to 12.4% false-positive results were reported because of the cross-reactivity of EV71 IgM with other enteroviruses (Xu et al., 2010).

            "text": "In the current study, we developed a new method for EV71 detection based on RT-LAMP. LAMP is a novel method of DNA amplification that is dependent on the activity of DNA strand displacement, with the help of Bst polymerase and 4 highly specific primers targeting 6 distinct regions (Mori, and Notomi, 2009, Notomi et al., 2000). An advantage of LAMP-based diagnosis over regular RT-PCR is specificity because the LAMP reaction does not proceed without the hybridization of 6 distinct sequences in the target DNA by 4 highly specific primers. The ability of the method to amplify from fewer copies of initial target DNA than required in PCR was conclusively demonstrated (Gunimaladevi et al., 2005, Kono et al., 2004, Parida et al., 2004). The efficiency of LAMP does not seem to be affected by the presence of nontarget genomic DNA in the reaction mixture (Notomi et al., 2000), which is highly desirable for the development of a diagnostic system. Detection of target DNA by LAMP is significantly more convenient than detection by 2-step nested PCR because the former amplifies DNA within only 1 step at isothermal conditions. Real-time turbidity measurements and end-point visual judgment make LAMP very practical for the diagnosis of pathogens. Thus, many reports on LAMP or RT-LAMP for pathogen detection have been published (Cardoso et al., 2010, Imai et al., 2006, Le Roux et al., 2009, Mori et al., 2006, Parida et al., 2004, Yoshida et al., 2007).",

            "text": "In the current research, we established a method of RT-LAMP for EV71 detection. The VP1 structure protein is a serotype-dependent protein and capable of self-association and dimerization to participate in viral capsid formation; it is also a major immune determinant. Thus, a conserved part of the VP1 gene (2577\u20132797) was selected as the RT-LAMP target (Fig. 1) and the RT-LAMP primer set (Table 1) was designed using online software. The results showed that the primer set can be applied to specifically amplify EV71 RNA (Fig. 2), but not other phylogenetically related enteroviruses, such as Coxsackie virus A16 and B4 (Fig. 4C). Initial copies for RT-LAMP amplification of EV71 RNA were lowered to 5\u201350, and the amplification could be detected by agarose electrophoresis (Fig. 4B). The sensitivity of RT-LAMP for EV71 detection was significantly higher than that of regular 2-step RT-PCR in current research with positive results of up to 97.1% for RT-LAMP and 83.7% for RT-PCR (Table 2). When this article was in preparation, a similar RT-LAMP method for EV71 detection was reported and the sensitivity for EV71 detection was 92.9% by evaluation of 40 clinical samples by targeting the VP3 gene of EV71 (Jiang et al., 2011). It was noticeable that clinical specimens identified with HFMD were generally reported to exhibit EV71 infection with 40\u201390%, which was dependent on the origin of the collected specimens (Singh et al., 2002, Zhang et al., 2009).",

The simplicity and clarity of the proposed method make it applicable for use even in resource-limited laboratories in rural areas of developing countries. Real-time turbidity measurements obtained by a cost-effective photometer with an incubation function enable kinetic analysis of the LAMP reaction without the need for any detection reagents, such as fluorescence, and allow quantification of the initial amount of template DNA in the samples (Mori, et al., 2001, Mori, et al., 2004, Saitou et al., 2010).",
