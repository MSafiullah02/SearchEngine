            "text": "A) To determine whether the cytoplasmic 5' exoribonuclease, Xrn1, or Xrn2, a predominantly nuclear 5' exoribonuclease, mediates decay of HJ3-5 virus RNA, Huh-7.5 cells were transfected twice with Xrn1-or Xrn2-specific siRNAs (or non-targeting siCtrl siRNA) to achieve high-grade depletion, then infected with HJ3-5 virus (m.o.i.=0.1). The cells were treated with sofosbuvir (SOF, 5.0 \u00b5M) 64 hrs after infection (nominal '0 hrs') to arrest viral RNA synthesis, then harvested at intervals and RNA extracted for quantitation of HCV RNA by RT-qPCR. (B) Immunoblots showing abundance of Xrn1 and Xrn2 in siRNA-transfected cells at '0' hrs as in panel A. (C) Relative intracellular HCV RNA abundance at '0' hrs (see panel A), normalized to \u03b2-actin mRNA and with siCtrl-transfected cells set arbitrarily to 100%. (*) p<0.05 compared to siCtrl-transfected cells by Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's correction for multiple comparisons. (D) HCV RNA decay following addition of SOF to cultures as shown in panel A. Lines were fit to a one-phase decay model (R 2 = 0.96-0.98). The estimated half-life (t \u00bd ) of HJ3-5 RNA was 7.9 hrs in siCtrl-transfected cells, compared with 12.8 hrs in Xrn1-depleted cells (***P<0.001) and 8.6 hrs in Xrn2-depleted cells (non-significant). The data represent means \u00b1 s.e.m. from 3 biological replicates and are representative of independent experiments. Significance was assessed by the extra sum-of-squares F test.

            "text": "Experimental Procedures). Thirty hours after a single transfection of siXrn1 or siCtrl, the cells were treated with SOF to terminate RNA synthesis, then 8 hrs later retransfected with duplex miR-122 or control miR-124. Cells were lysed and viral RNA quantified by qRT-PCR at intervals thereafter. (F) Residual HCV RNA abundance in the SOF-treated cells following transfection of miR-122 and miR124 as outlined in panel E. Data were fit to a one-phase decay model (R 2 =0.98-0.99). The estimated half-life of HJ3-5/NS5A YFP RNA did not differ significantly between miR-124-transfected cells, 8.3 hrs, and miR-122-transfected cells, 9.6 hrs. Data shown represent mean \u00b1 s.e.m. from three biological replicates and are representative of multiple independent experiments. The data shown in panels C, D, and F of this figure confirm earlier published results with a different virus strain (genotype 1a H77S.3) (Li et al., 2013b) . Newly synthesized viral RNA could be used by the replicase to template additional RNA synthesis, shuttled to ribosomes to template protein synthesis, or packaged and exported from infected cells in newly assembled virions. In this experiment, we examined how miR-122 influences the amount of detectable nascent viral RNA remaining associated with cells when transfected into cells after the ablation of new viral RNA synthesis with sofosbuvir (SOF). (A) Experimental scheme. HCV-infected cells were transfected with Xrn1-specific (siXrn1) or control (siCtrl) siRNAs 48 hrs prior to the addition of 5-EU to the culture to metabolically label nascent RNA. Following a 4 hr labeling period, cells were washed and refed with fresh medium containing SOF (20 \u00b5M) to terminate HCV RNA synthesis. Transfection mixes containing either miR-122 or the control miR-124 were added to the cultures 1 hr later (see Experimental Procedures). At intervals thereafter ('0', 2, 4, 8 and 12 hrs), the cells were washed, lysed by the addition of RLT Buffer (Qiagen), and stored at -80\u00b0 C for RNA extraction. Cellassociated 5-EU-labelled nascent RNA was subsequently quantified as described in the main manuscript. (B) Residual nascent RNA in Xrn1-depleted versus siCtrl-transfected control cells following arrest of viral RNA synthesis with SOF and supplementation with miR-122 versus miR-124 as described in panel A. Residual nascent RNA is shown as the percent of that present in miR-124-treated siCtrl cells at time '0' and represents the mean \u00b1 s.e.m. values from two independent experiments each with replicate RT-qPCR measurements. Data were fit to a one-phase decay model (R 2 0.884-0.975). (C) Nascent HCV RNA detectable at the initial time point. Values are derived from the one-phase decay model, and are shown \u00b1 95% confidence intervals (CI). miR-122 transfection reproducibly increased detectable nascent RNA in siCtrl-transfected cells (P<0.0001 by the extra sum-of-squares F test), but had no such effect in Xrn1-depleted cells. The estimated t\u00bd of nascent RNA (presumably the sum of RNA decay and RNA export in newly formed virions) did not vary significantly between the different experimental conditions (mean t\u00bd = 3.4 hrs). (A) Immunoblots of AGO2 and \u03b2-actin in lysates of Xrn1-depleted cells treated with 50 \u00b5g/mL puromycin for 4, 5, or 8 hrs. The cells were transfected with miR-124 or miR-122 2 hrs after the addition of puromycin, as in the experimental protocol shown in Figure 5A . Each lane in the SDS-PAGE gel was loaded with 5 \u00b5g protein from lysate. (B) AGO2 band intensity determined from infrared scanning of the immunoblots shown in panel A. Results shown represent the mean \u00b1 s.e.m. band intensities combining results from lysates of cells transfected with either miRNA. (C) Quantitation of miR-122 co-immunoprecipitating with AGO2 from lysates of cells prepared 1 hr following transfection with miR-122 or miR-124. Cells were either untreated, or treated with puromycin 50 \u00b5g/mL for 2 hrs before and 1 hr after transfection of the miRNA. Heavily shaded bars represent miR-122 precipitating non-specifically with an isotype control antibody (Ig Control). Distribution of 18S and 28S rRNA in a representative polysome gradient confirms expected positions of 40S, 60S and 80S ribosomes and ribosome subunits in the gradient fractions. Also shown is the distribution of negative-strand HCV RNA (detected by a strand-specific qRT-PCR assay with >1000fold specificity for detection of synthetic negative-vs. positive-strand RNA, as described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Results shown are the mean \u00b1 s.e.m. percent of the total negative-strand RNA detected in fractions from two control gradients. Negative-strand RNA was most abundant in fractions 6-7. The experiment was carried out as described in the legend to Figure 6 in the main manuscript. Results shown represent the mean of two independent RT-PCR assays carried out on fractions from a gradient loaded with lysate from Xrn1-depleted cells collected 2 hrs after transfection of the miRNAs. See legend to Figure 6 for additional details.",

HJ3-5/NS5A YFP virus-infected cells were transfected with siXrn1, then 48 hrs later treated for 3 hrs with puromycin (PUR) or cycloheximide (CHX) before transfection of duplex miR-124 or miR-122. Immediately after miRNA transfection, the cells were incubated in fresh culture media containing the protein synthesis inhibitor and either [ 35 S]-methionine/cysteine or 5-EU for an additional 12 hrs, then analyzed for nascent HCV RNA or NS5A-YFP protein as inFigure5 in the main manuscript. (B) SDS-PAGE of [ 35 S]-labeled proteins immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody from lysates of cells treated or not treated with puromycin (50 \u00b5g/mL). See panel D for immunoprecipitation results with the isotype control antibody. Precipitated NS5A-YFP protein was quantified by phosphorimager analysis with results shown at the bottom as the % present in the absence of puromycin. (C) miR-122-mediated increases in nascent HCV RNA in the presence versus absence of puromycin treatment (50 \u00b5g/mL). Results are shown as mean copies per \u00b5g total RNA \u00b1 s.e.m. from triplicate pairs of cultures.
