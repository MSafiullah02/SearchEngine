Some studies, mainly from China, have shown that COVID-19 patients have a high prevalence of cardiovascular disease, hypertension and diabetes, but how much this is due to the epidemiological characteristics of the population at risk of COVID-19 (elderly) and how much is due to a specific risk associated with these conditions is not clear [89]. Also, some small studies have shown that patients with cardiovascular disease are at a higher risk of complications, such as myocarditis and myocardial infarction, but what are the most frequent cardiovascular complications and which are the patients with cardiovascular disease at a higher risk remain unknown [10]. The information on management strategies for patients with cardiovascular disease and COVID-19 is also limited, one of the most debated topics is the relationship between the angiotensin- converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and COVID-19. ACE2 has a vital role in the cardiovascular systems and has been also identified as a functional receptor for coronaviruses (infection is triggered by binding of the spike protein of the virus to ACE2) [11]. There have been publications (mainly letters) suggesting a deleterious (or beneficial) effect of ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker on patients with COVID-19, but these are mainly theories [1213]. Since research is lacking, several international organizations have released statements highlighting the lack of evidence for any harmful effect and asking physicians not to change clinical practice based on this hypothesis [141516].",
