To control the spread of the disease, screening large numbers of suspected cases for appropriate quarantine and treatment measures is a priority. Viral nucleic acid testing based on specimens from the lower respiratory tract is the diagnostic gold standard. However, the availability and quality of laboratory testing in the infected region presents a challenge\uff0cso alternative diagnostic methods are urgently needed to combat the disease. Based on COVID-19 radiographical changes in CT images, we hypothesized that Artificial Intelligence's deep learning methods might be able to extract COVID-19's specific graphical features and provide a clinical diagnosis ahead of the pathogenic test, thus saving critical time for disease control. To test this possibility, we collected 453 CT images of pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 cases along with previously diagnosed with typical viral pneumonia. 217 images were used as the training set and the inception migration-learning model was used to establish the algorithm. The internal validation achieved a total accuracy of 82.9% with specificity of 80.5% and sensitivity of 84%. The external testing dataset showed a total accuracy of 73.1% with specificity of 67% and sensitivity of 74%.",

With the most recent estimated viral reproduction number (R0), the average number of other people that an infected individual will transmit the virus to in a completely non-immune population, stands at about 3.77 [1] , indicating that a rapid spread of the disease is imminent. Therefore, it is crucial to identify infected individuals as early as possible for quarantine and treatment procedures. The diagnosis of COVID-19 relies on the following criteria: clinical symptoms, epidemiological history and positive CT images as well as positive pathogenic testing. The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, dyspna, and viral pneumonia [2] [3] [4] [5] , however, these symptoms are nonspecific, as there are isolated cases where, for example, in an asymptomatic infected family a chest CT scan revealed pneumonia and the pathogenic test for the virus came back positive.",

This laboratory technology is based on real-time RT-PCR and sequencing of nucleic acid from the virus [6, 7] . Since the beginning of the outbreak, the efficiency of nucleic acid testing has been dependent on several rate-limiting factors, including availability and quantity of the testing kits in the affected area. More importantly, the quality, stability and reproducibility of the detection kits are questionable. The impact of methodology, disease development stages, specimen collection methods, nucleic acid extraction methods and the amplification system are all determinant factors for the accuracy of test results. Conservative estimates of the detection rate of nucleic acid are low (between 30-50%), and tests need to be repeated several times in many cases before they can be confirmed.",

In the present study, we have developed an AI program by analyzing representative CT images using a deep learning method. This is a retrospective, multicohort, diagnostic study. We constructed an Inception migration neuro network that achieved 82.9% accuracy. Moreover, the high performance of the deep learning model we developed in this study was tested using external samples with 73% accuracy. These findings have demonstrated the proof of principle that deep learning can extract CT image features of COVID-19 for diagnostic purposes. Further developing this system can significantly shorten the diagnosis time for disease control. In addition, it can reduce the diagnostic workload of physicians in the field.

Although we are satisfied with the initial results, we believe that with more CT images included in the training, we will achieve higher accuracy.

The performance of this system is expected to increase when the training volume is increased.

In order to reduce the computation complexity, and based on the signs characteristic of pneumonia, regions of interest (ROI) were extracted from CT images. For a ROI, it is sized approximately from 395*223 to 636*533 pixels. We picked 195 ROIs from 44 COVID-19 positive pneumonia patients and 258 ROIs from 50 COVID-19 negative patients. We built a transfer learning neural network based on Inception network. The entire neural network can be roughly divided into two parts: the first part uses a pre-trained inception network to convert image data into one-dimensional feature vectors, and the second part uses a fully connected network and the main role is for classification prediction. We randomly take 2-3 pictures from each case to form a training dataset. The number of various types of pictures in the training set is approximately equal, with a total number of 236. The remaining CT pictures of each case were used for validation. The model training is iterated 15,000 times with a step size of 0.01. In total, 236 ROIs were used to train the model and 217 ROI were extracted for validation.",

AUC is an index to measure the performance of the classifier. NPV was used to evaluate the algorithm for screening and PPV was the probability of getting a disease when the diagnostic index is positive.

These images were randomly divided into a training set and a validation set. First, we randomly selected two or three images from all of the patients' images for training and the remaining images were used for internal validation. The model training has been iterated for 15,000 times with a step size of 0.01. The training loss curve is shown in To test the stability and generalization of the model, we also randomly selected 237 images (118 images from COVID-19 negative and 119 images from COVID-19 positive) to construct the model.
