Five cases with a clinical history of biopolymers in the gluteal region that developed iatrogenic allogenosis (IA) are presented here. The 5 cases were put under colchicine treatment for IA crisis and had non-specific symptoms (headache, cough without dyspnoea, and arthralgias) with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Their close contacts had mild to severe symptoms and three of them died. In the SARS-CoV-2 infection different inflammatory pathways are altered where colchicine reduces cytokine levels as well as the activation of macrophages, neutrophils, and the inflammasome. The possible mechanisms that colchicine may use to prevent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with COVID-19 infection are also reviewed in this article.",

            "text": "Colchicine is a tricyclic alkaloid that is extracted from the plant Colchicum autumnale. Colchicine acts as a potent inhibitor of tubulin polymerization. The mechanism studied the most is colchicine's high affinity for binding to the \u03b2-tubulin subunit to prevent it from assembling and thus block microtubule polymerization 6 . Microtubules are the key piece of the cytoskeleton and are involved in multiple cellular processes such as maintaining the shape of the cell, transferring intracellular substances, secreting cytokines and chemokines, cell migration, regulating ion channels, and cell division. Colchicine is an antimitotic substance that blocks cell division during metaphase 6 . It stimulates independent GTPase activity to promote the loss of the microtubule GTP cap and prevent assembly. When colchicine binds to tubulin, the straight conformation of the \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin heterodimeric subunits is lost resulting in curved tubulin heterodimers. The lateral contacts between adjacent \u03b1\u03b2-subunits that are needed to maintain interaction between them is lost and, as lateral contacts decrease, microtubules disassemble. Colchicine may also modify the voltage-dependent anion channels of mitochondrial membranes, thereby limiting mitochondrial metabolism 7 . Colchicine has an additional effect on the chemotaxis of inflammatory cells Finally, colchicine reduces the neutrophil production of free radicals like superoxide 8 . It has also been associated with disrupting inflammasome activation, thereby suppressing caspase-1 activation and the subsequent release of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 9 . The SARS-CoV-1 infection has been associated with inflammasome activation 10 by calcium ion transportation leading to IL-1-\uf062 overproduction 11 , direct caspase-1 activation, or an enhanced potassium efflux 12 ( Figure 1 ). Within the bloodstream, ~40% of colchicine binds to albumin. Peak plasma concentrations occur 1 hour after administration and maximal anti-inflammatory effects develop over 24 to 48 hours based on intra-leukocyte accumulation. Colchicine reaches much higher concentrations within leukocytes than in plasma and persists there for several days after ingestion.",

The P glycoprotein is encoded by the MDR1 gene, and certain MDR1 polymorphisms are associated with increased P-gp expression/activity and decreased serum colchicine concentrations 14 . A smaller, but significant quantity of absorbed colchicine is metabolized by hepatic P450 cytochrome CYP3A4, or directly eliminated by the kidneys through glomerular filtration. All of these mechanisms are vulnerable to drug interaction which can affect bloodstream levels 6 . In general, colchicine has been safely administered. However, when there is an overdose, toxicity includes neutropenia, gastrointestinal upset, bone marrow damage, and anemia. Colchicine's toxicity is due to its antimitotic properties. It binds to tubulin in cells and causes impaired protein assembly, mitotic arrest, and multi-organ dysfunction but is safe when used according to the established therapeutic guidelines, and toxicity is rare if the recommended doses are not exceeded 7 .",

The CD4 and CD8 T lymphocyte count is lower, and the ureic nitrogen and creatinine is higher. In other words, there is an evident suppression of cellular immunity along with a severe inflammatory reaction that can lead to death. There is a greater proportion of dyspnea symptoms in patients who die compared to survivors who do not suffer fevers, headaches, and other symptoms (p <0.001) 22 . Other factors that are prevalent in patients who die from COVID-19 are a decrease in albumin, an increase in lactate, a slight decrease in the number of red cells and hemoglobin, and an increase in lactic dehydrogenase 23 . Among the predictors of the best prognosis are a high level of lymphocytes and female gender, characteristics that appear in a greater proportion in the group of survivors.",

Neutrophils are recruited to the lungs by cytokines while toxic mediators such as oxygen free radicals and proteases are activated and released 25 . Extensive production of free radicals exceeds the capacity of endogenous antioxidants and causes oxidative cell damage. Efforts should focus on preventing the development of ARDS in patients with COVID-19 infections since once it occurs, mortality is very high and our health systems do not have the capacity to care for as many critically ill patients as has been seen in Italy, Spain and currently, the USA. Therefore, we propose the use of colchicine in patients who are at risk of developing ARDS and who meet clinical and laboratory criteria that predict the appearance of ARDS.",

Colchicine has been shown to modulate lipopolysaccharide-induced secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) by liver macrophages in a rat model 6 . In a mouse brain macrophage cell line, colchicine inhibited ATP-induced IL1\u03b2 release by preventing microtubule rearrangement and constraining activation of the Ras homolog gene family, which contains the protein kinase (ROCK) pathway. In the presence of colchicine, mouse peritoneal macrophages showed less ATP-induced permeability to ethidium bromide and less formation of reactive species of oxygen (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), IL1\u03b2 release, crystal-induced chemotactic factor, myeloid inhibitory C type-like lectin, toll-like receptors, and vascular endothelial growth factor 6 . All these compounds intervene to intensify the inflammatory process and are responsible for alveolar damage, interstitial infiltration, and lung collapse. Colchicine can minimize such damage using different paths. Colchicine was found to be most effective when it was introduced into the medium at early stages of infection. It may also inhibit the formation of messenger RNA for interferonogenesis.",
