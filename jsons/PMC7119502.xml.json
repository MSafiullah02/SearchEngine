            "text": "Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) are non-segmented RNA viruses which belong to Paramyxoviridae family (Pringle, 1997) and are distributed widely with a seroprevalence of 50\u201390% in children and young adults. HPIV-1, -2, -3 are an important cause of upper and lower respiratory tract diseases in both adults and children (Hall, 2001, Henrickson, 2003). HPIVs cause severe clinical manifestations in immunocompromised hosts, such as HPIV-2-related giant cells pneumonia and HPIV-3-associated interstitial pneumonia (Chanock et al., 2001, Sable and Hayden, 1995). The availability of HPIV-specific diagnostic assays allows differentiation from other respiratory pathogens since clinical patterns are overlapping. HPIV infection can be confirmed by viral isolation (time required, 7\u201310 days), direct/indirect rapid detection of viral antigens in cell culture (LLC-MK2, Hep-2, Vero, HEF) (time required, 2\u20135 days), and molecular tests (Niesters, 2002, Sable and Hayden, 1995, Vernet, 2004). Currently, IFA is the \u201cgold standard\u201d for virological diagnosis, however molecular methods result in more sensitive, specific, and rapid detection of respiratory viruses (van Elden et al., 2002).",

Informed consent was obtained from all the patients or the nearest relatives and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital San Giovanni Battista of Turin. Human laryngeal epidermoid carcinoma (Hep-2) cells and African green monkey kidney epithelial (Vero) cells were used for primary viral isolation and propagation. Cell lines were obtained from the Zooprofilattic Institute of Lombardy and Emilia Romagna (BS TCL 23 and BS CL 86, respectively). Hep-2 and Vero cells were maintained at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 with supplemented MEM (PAA Laboratories GmbH, Pasching, Austria) containing 1% filtered glutamine, 0.15% antibiotic agent (PenStrep, Sigma\u2013Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO), 0.2% antimycotic agent (Fungizone, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Sermoneta, Italy), and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; PAA Laboratories GmbH). Infection was carried out at 50\u201360% confluence. Each infected flake (T25, Falcon, Becton Dickinson, Milano, Italy) was inoculated with a solution containing 20 \u03bcl of each viral stock and 1.2 ml of MEM with 2% FCS. The medium for HPIV-1 infection contained no FCS and was supplemented with 1 \u03bcg/ml of trypsin (GIBCO, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The flakes which were not inoculated with virus were used as controls. Cells were maintained for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 to assist viral adsorption. Subsequently, the inoculum was removed and MEM with 2% FCS was added. The cell monolayers were observed daily for cytopathic effect (CPE). For virus recovering, the cellular media were centrifuged for 7 min at 210 \u00d7 \ng and the supernatants were kept on ice. The cell monolayers were scraped and a thermal treatment was performed to extract viral particles from cells consisting in rapid freezing on liquid nitrogen followed by defrosting for 5 m at 37 \u00b0C for three times. The recovered viral particles were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Ninety six-well plates at 50\u201360% confluence Hep-2 and Vero were inoculated with 100 \u03bcl of 10-fold diluted virus or medium (i.e. negative control) for TCID50 assay.

Subsequently, the slides were incubated with a generic anti-HPIVs MAb (11-040 LOT M1601-Z; Argene, Verniolle, France) for 30 m at 37 \u00b0C and then with goat anti-mouse fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibody (51-010 LOT N0310; Argene), as secondary antibody, for 30 m at 37 \u00b0C.

Single positive cells showing a granular cytoplasmic fluorescence were seen at lower TCID50 (e.g. 10\u22121 to 10\u22122), while at higher TCID50 (e.g. 102 to 101) rare syncytial formations were appreciable. There was no difference between 1:40 and 1:80 MAb dilutions in terms of fluorescence intensity, while a decrement using 1:160 dilution was evident (data not shown). On day 4, HPIV-2-IFA sensitivity on Vero and Hep-2 cells was 10\u22122 TCID50 and 10\u22121 TCID50, respectively (Fig. 1B). A granular cytoplasmic fluorescence in infected cellular foci with a \u201cspread\u201d infection pattern at lower TCID50 (e.g. 10\u22121 to 10\u22122) was observed; while at higher TCID50 (e.g. 102 to 101), the fluorescence involved the nucleus. With Vero cells, the stain intensity resulted dependent on MAb dilution and reduced constantly with the increase of MAb dilution from 1:40 to 1:160; while no significant difference was observed on Hep-2 cells. On day 4, HPIV-3-IFA sensitivity on Vero and Hep-2 cells was 10\u22121 TCID50 and 101 TCID50, respectively (Fig. 1C). A lower intensity of fluorescence was seen with high MAb dilutions, such as 1:80 and 1:160, in comparison to 1:40. Since Hep-2 cells had a very low sensitivity on day 4 post-infection, cell culture was prolonged until day 7; however, this resulted in only 1-log increment of sensitivity. A widespread and homogeneous cytoplasmic fluorescence pattern in both cellular models at lower TCID50 (e.g. 10\u22121 to 10\u22122) was observed; while at higher TCID50 (e.g. 102 to 101), syncytial formation was seen. Interestingly, HPIV-3 infection pattern was \u201call or nothing\u201d, as the first dilution higher than that of sensitivity threshold (spread staining) appeared completely negative. In Table 1 the reproducibility and sensitivity (i.e. the lowest TCID50 concentration detectable at a frequency of 100%) of IFA are reported.",

Different IFA conditions were evaluated, such as cellular models, days post-infection, and MAb concentrations. According to the features of the replication cycle of HPIV (Vainionpaa and Hyypia, 1994), a cytoplasmic staining of infected cells was observed, although it became nuclear (HPIV-2 infection) or syncytial (HPIV-3 infection) on day 3\u20134 post-infection. The two cellular models showed different susceptibility to HPIVs infection. In the case of HPIV-1, Hep-2 had a sensitivity of 10\u22122 TCID50 on day 3 post-infection using a MAb concentration of 1:80 (similar to that obtained by others (Aguilar et al., 2000) on NCI-H292 cells), while TCID50 calculation on Vero cells was not attained because of their inefficient growth in the presence of trypsin, necessary for attachment of HPIV-1. Vero cells were more suitable for detection of HPIV-2 and -3. HPIV-2 sensitivity was 10\u22122 TCID50 on day 4 post-infection using 1:40 MAb dilution versus 2 \u00d7 10\u22122 found by Aguilar et al. (2000). The typical \u201cspread\u201d staining reflects HPIV-2 infection strategy, in which contiguous cells are infected subsequently. HPIV-3 had a sensitivity of 10\u22121 TCID50 on Vero cells on day 4 post-infection using 1:40 MAb dilution versus \u223c3 \u00d7 101 found by Aguilar et al. (2000). The pattern of HPIV-3 infection (i.e. \u201call or nothing\u201d) is likely to reflect the simultaneous infection of both nuclear and cytoplasmic structures. It should be note that, although the primary MAb is able to recognize simultaneously HPIV-1, -2 and -3 without differentiating the virus, but not HPIV-4a\u2013b, as indicated by the manufacturer, the fluorescence pattern observed was specific for each virus, thus permitting discrimination by IFA in the absence of co-infections. Also the intensity differed in relation to the MAb dilution and cellular model employed: staining on Vero cells was MAb dilution-dependent, with high dilutions (1:80\u20131:160) resulting in unfocused and blurred fluorescence; whereas on Hep-2 cells, 1:40 or 1:80 showed a similar intensity, with a reduction at 1:160 dilution.",
