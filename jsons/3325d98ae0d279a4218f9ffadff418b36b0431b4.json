Commonly named copaiba, the oleoresin has been found to exhibit strong antimicrobial effects in our previous study, which could be attributed to some of its diterpenoid constituents. In order to find new biological activities and to eventually enhance the before observed effects, (\u2212)-polyalthic acid (1) and kaurenoic acid (2), together with eight prepared semi-synthetic derivatives (1a-1c and 2a-2e) were evaluated for their cytotoxic, antibacterial and antifungal properties. Regarding the gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecium and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, we found that both the exocylic methylene group and the carboxyl group were crucial for the activity against these two clinically relevant bacterial strains. Investigation of the antifungal activity, in contrast, showed that the carboxyl group is unnecessary for the effect against the dermatophytes Trichophyton rubrum and Cryptococcus neoformans, indicated by low micromolar IC 50 values for both (\u2212)-polyalthic acid diethylamide (1a) as well as (\u2212)-polyalthic acid methyl ester (1b). Apart from studying the biological activity, the structure of one semi-synthetic derivative, compound 1c, is being reported for the first time. During the course of the structure elucidation of the new compound, we discovered inconsistencies regarding the stereochemistry of polyalthic acid and its stereoisomers, which we clarified in the present work.",

In the same study, antidermatophytic activity against two Trichopyhton species was detected for (\u2212)-polyalthic acid (1), the major diterpenoid in the Copaifera reticulata oleoresin, along with weak [(\u2212)-polyalthic acid, 1] to moderate (kaurenoic acid, 2) cytotoxic effects against six cancer cell lines.

            "text": "The first two of these four compounds to be reported were (\u2212)-polyalthic acid (1) and daniellic acid in 1961. As the absolute configuration has not been determined yet, (\u2212)polyalthic acid is correctly described as (rel-1S,4aS,5R,8aS)-5-[2-(furan-3-yl)ethyl]-1,4a-dimethyl-6-methylenedecahydronaphthalene-1-carboxylic acid. Daniellic acid was isolated from Daniellia oliveri (Fabaceae, Caesalpinioideae) (Haeuser and Ourisson 1961) , whereas (\u2212)-polyalthic acid (1) was obtained from Polyalthia fragrans (Annonaceae) and named polyalthic acid (Gopinath et al. 1961) . Both compounds were attributed to possess the \"wrong\" configuration corresponding to an ent-labdane scaffold and showing negative optical rotation values. Both compounds are epimers, only differing in the orientation of the carboxyl group at position C-4, which is axial for daniellic acid and equatorial for (\u2212)polyalthic acid (1). Five years later, the first report for lambertianic acid, isolated from Pinus lambertiana (Pinaceae), was made (Dauben and Dauben and German 1965) . Lambertianic acid was found to be the optical antipode of daniellic acid and thus to be the first furan diterpene with the so-called normal labdane configuration. The last of the four isomers was the optical antipode of (\u2212)-polyalthic acid (1), isolated from Sequoia semperivirens, Taxodiaceae (Ohta and Nawamaki 1978) . However, instead of choosing an original trivial name (e.g. semperiviric acid), the authors named the compound (+)-polyalthic acid, being (rel-1R,4aR,5S,8aR)-5-[2-(furan-3-yl)ethyl]-1,4a-dimethyl-6-methylenedecahydronaphthalene-1-carboxylic acid. Thus, from then onwards, two forms of polyalthic acid existed in the literature. Except for the last 3 years, where (+)-and (\u2212)-or ent-prefixes were used to differentiate between the two enantiomers (Bardaj\u00ed et al. 2016; Borges et al. 2016; Carneiro et al. 2018; \u00c7i\u00e7ek et al. 2018; Pfeifer Barbosa et al. 2019; Senedese et al. 2019) , only one publication in almost four decades adopted such prefixes (Miyazawa et al. 1995) . The missing stereochemistry did not represent a problem as long as the studies were dealing with Copaifera, because the ent-configuration is abundant in this genus (Leandro et al. 2012 ). However, some wherefore, the identity of the right enantiomer remained unknown. Thus, reporting the right configuration for polyalthic acid is absolutely necessary. Another problem is that the introduction of (+)-polyalthic acid and the recent use of the ent-prefix for differentiation of the enantiomers seems to have caused confusions in some large databases, such as SciFinder\u2122 or Reaxys\u2122. For example, when searching for structure templates of polyalthic acid in the Reaxys database, three suggestions are delivered, of which two display (\u2212)-polyalthic acid and the other one shows (+)-polyalthic acid. However, by using the name entpolyalthic acid, also two structures are displayed, one for (\u2212)-polyalthic acid and the second one for daniellic acid. For both compounds their semisystematic names are given along with twelve references per compound, thus giving equal priority to the correct and the incorrect structure. By looking for chemical structures in the SciFinder database, the name polyalthic acid leads to the structure of (\u2212)-polyalthic acid, which is historically correct, whereas the search for entpolyalthic acid gives the structure of daniellic acid and thus the wrong compound. Alas, these inconsistencies or confusions, respectively, led to several publications showing the structure of daniellic acid instead of (\u2212)-polyalthic acid (Leandro et al. 2012 , \u00c7i\u00e7ek et al. 2018 , Da Silva et al. 2017 Pfeifer Barbosa et al. 2019) . The mentioned problems can be partly dealt with by using the prefixes of the respective optical rotations, leading to the exact structures for both (+)-and (\u2212)polyalthic acid in the Reaxys database and also to the correct structure for (+)-polyalthic acid with the SciFinder database. Only the name (\u2212)-polyalthic acid does not yield any results with SciFinder, but as the name polyalthic acid leads to the structure of (\u2212)-polyalthic acid and the optical rotation can be retrieved from the experimental details, at least no misinformation is spread. We therefore suggest to use the prefix for the optical rotation only.",

Thus, the effect of derivatising either the carboxyl group or the exocyclic methylene group was the main aim of the present study. In a first screening at a concentration of 100 \u03bcg/ml no effects for derivatives without the exocyclic methylene group (1c and 2c-2e) were observed (Table S1 ). Compounds 2d and 2e were earlier tested on four different cancer cell lines (K562, HL-60, MDA-MB435 and SF295) as well as on healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells and compared with kaurenoic acid (Cavalcanti et al. 2009 ). Also here, the cytotoxic effect disappeared after derivatisation; wherefore, the authors hypothesised that the exocyclic methylene group is crucial for the cytotoxic effect.",

However, at a concentration of 100 \u03bcg/ml, activity of compounds 1 and 2 as well as their derivatives against the additionally investigated organisms was rather low or nonexistent in contrast to the already known effects against E. faecium and MRSA. But also against the latter two strains derivatisations did not lead to an improved activity (Table 2) . Here, only compound 2c showed (at least moderate) effects, with IC 50 values of 59.7 \u03bcg/ml against E. faecium and 34.7 \u03bcg/ml against MRSA. In contrast, (\u2212)-polyalthic acid (1) and kaurenoic acid (2) showed IC 50 values of 8.5 and 2.3 \u03bcg/ml against E. faecium as well as 8.9 and 3.4 \u03bcg/ml against MRSA, respectively.

Derivatisation of the two natural products this time revealed a different picture, leading to one equally potent (1b) and another still moderately active compound (1a) against T. rubrum, with IC 50 values of 7.7 \u03bcg/ml for (\u2212)-polyalthic acid methyl ester (1b) and 13.8 \u03bcg/ml for (\u2212)-polyalthic acid N,N-diethylamide (1a), respectively. Notably, this effect was not observed against T. mentagrophytes, where the IC 50 value was increased by the factor five. For kaurenoic acid (2), a similar picture was observed. Here, amidation (2a) and esterification (2b) yielded even more active compounds against T. rubrum, though on an overall higher level. Still, also against T. mentagrophytes the activity was drastically reduced by derivatisation of the carboxyl group. Of the remaining derivatives, only compound 1c showed activity, with an IC 50 of 61.8 \u03bcg/ml against T. rubrum and 31.9 \u03bcg/ml against T. mentagrophytes. The compounds were furthermore investigated for their inhibitory potential against two yeasts, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. While the activity against C. albicans was negligible (Table S3) , the results against C. neoformans revealed interesting findings for compounds 1, 1a and 1b. All three compounds showed similar IC 50 values, which were in the range of 9.5 to 11.2 \u03bcg/ml (Table 3) .
