            "text": "Background: The incidence and pathophysiology of right ventricular failure in patients with severe respiratory insufficiency has been largely investigated. However, there is a lack of early signs suggesting right ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction prior to acute cor pulmonale development. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analytical cohort study of patients for acute respiratory distress syndrome undertaking an echocardiography during admission in the cardiothoracic intensive care unit. Patients were divided according to treatment: conventional protective ventilation (38 patients, 38%); interventional lung assist (23 patients, 23%); veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (37 patients, 37%). Systolic and diastolic function was studied assessing, respectively: right ventricular systolic longitudinal function (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion) and systolic contraction duration (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion length); right ventricular diastolic filling time and right ventricular diastolic restrictive pattern (presence of pulmonary valve presystolic ejection wave). Correlation between the respiratory mechanics and systo-diastolic parameters were analysed. Results: In 98 patients studied, systolic dysfunction (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion <16 mm) was present in 33.6% while diastolic restrictive pattern was present in 64%. A negative correlation was found between tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion length (P<0.0001; r \u22120.42). Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion length correlated with right ventricular diastolic filling time (P<0.001; r \u22120.39). Pulmonary valve presystolic ejection wave was associated with tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (P<0.0001), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion length (P<0.0001), right ventricular diastolic filling time (P<0.0001), positive end-expiratory pressure (P<0.0001) and peak inspiratory pressure (P<0.0001). Conclusion: Diastolic restrictive pattern is present in a remarkable percentage of patients with respiratory distress syndrome. Bedside echocardiography allows a mechanistic evaluation of systolic and diastolic interaction of the right ventricle.",

            "text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is associated with alveolar epithelial and microvascular endothelial injury, resulting in severe hypoxemia, decreased pulmonary compliance and increased pulmonary vascular resistance. 1, 2 The resulting increase in right ventricular (RV) afterload and different ventilatory strategies may induce RV dysfunction and, in extreme cases, acute cor pulmonale (ACP), 3 with variable reported effects on mortality. 4 The optimal management of ARDS remains a challenge in intensive care medicine. Lungprotective strategies, using lower end-inspiratory (plateau) airway pressure, lower tidal volumes (Vt) and higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5, 6 and, eventually, rescue with extracorporeal support remains the cornerstone. 6, 7 The incidence and mechanisms of RV dysfunction in the severe acute respiratory failure patient population has previously been investigated. 4 However, data regarding incidence and outcome vary among the studies 4 and, more importantly, the published data focused mainly on ACP, which represents the last stage of RV dysfunction. 8, 9 Aside from the literature regarding ACP, there are few studies quantifying the RV systolic function in ARDS and no data are available regarding RV diastolic function and systo-diastolic interrelation. 4 Quantitative assessment of RV function can be performed by several methods, of which tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) can be obtained routinely in critically ill patients and correlates well with RV function. [10] [11] [12] [13] However, there is a paucity of data regarding non-invasive indices that allow us to identify RV injury before the onset of failure.",

As per guidelines, a TAPSE less than 1.6 cm was considered pathological. 20 Moreover, TAPSE length with respect to the ECG, was also assessed and regarded as post-ejectional shortening when annular displacement peaked after the T wave on the ECG, meaning a pathological systolic contraction elongating during the proto-diastolic period. 20, 21 The pulmonary artery systolic diameter was measured in modified parasternal long axis and parasternal short axis views. Pulmonary artery flow was measured by placing the pulsed-wave Doppler sample volume at the centre of the transpulmonary valve flow. Presystolic A wave (PV a wave or pulmonary end-diastolic forward flow) is seen, when present, as an anterograde flow through the pulmonary valve in correspondence to the atrial systole (P wave at the superimposed ECG) preceding the ventricular contraction ( Figure 1 ). Right ventricular filling time (RVFT) was measured as the interval between the onset of the E wave to the end of the A wave using pulse wave Doppler with the cursor placed at the RV inflow in apical four-chamber view. As filling times depend on heart rate, RVFT was adjusted accordingly. RV ejection time was quantified as the interval between the onset of forward pulmonary flow and the onset of the pulmonary valve closure artefact. Furthermore, pulmonary valve acceleration time (PV ACC time), calculated as the interval between the onset of ejection and the peak flow velocity, was measured as it is a Doppler echocardiographic parameter strongly correlated with right heart catheterisation-based measures of pulmonary vascular resistance. 22, 23 Pulmonary arterial systolic pressure was determined from the tricuspid regurgitation jet velocity using the simplified Bernoulli equation adding the right atrial pressure measured directly from the central venous pressure at end expiration. 18 ",

[25] [26] [27] However, ACP may be a relatively late phenomenon in RV dysfunction. 9 TAPSE has been the most common parameter to define RV systolic dysfunction 10 because it evaluates the excursion of the longitudinal fibres, revealing the contribution of the RV itself to systolic contraction. 28, 29 However, there are no data regarding post-ejectional shortening, a phenomenon related to the perfusion mismatch of the longitudinal fibres that may lead to both a reduction of longitudinal shortening and an increase in the duration of longitudinal myocardial contraction (annular displacement peaking after the T wave on the ECG). 20 This phenomenon results in a decline of the effective proto-diastolic filling period, leading to a reduction in stroke volume and demonstrating a severe systodiastolic interaction impairment. [30] [31] [32] This mechanism is largely demonstrated in patients with LV dysfunction while it has never been described in the RV. We hereby report the existence of post-ejectional shortening on RV and its correlation with both reductions of TAPSE excursion and with the impairment of diastolic filling time (RVFT).",

            "text": "The PV A wave represents an anterograde diastolic pulmonary arterial flow, coincident with premature opening of the pulmonary valve during right atrial systole, reflecting reduced RV diastolic compliance and RV restrictive pattern at end diastole. 14, 33 Simultaneous catheter pressure monitoring has previously demonstrated that this flow occurs when the RV end-diastolic pressure equals or exceeds the pulmonary arterial diastolic pressure. 14, 15 In our population, the PV a wave was present in a consistent percentage of patients and was significantly associated with ventilation established factors that increase intrathoracic pressures and pulmonary vascular resistance (Supplementary Table 1) . Interestingly, the patients in the iLA groups had minor haemodynamic impairment. One possible explanation is that those who did not exhibit hypoxic issues had less severe parenchymal impairment, with a less severe V/Q mismatch and lower pulmonary vascular resistance. Previous studies on RV dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension pathophysiology have shown that for the right ventricle to fail needs the coexistence of two conditions: an increase in afterload and a reduction of coronary perfusion. [35] [36] [37] [38] The increased afterload leads to significant change in RV pulmonary valve loop inducing a significant alteration in diastolic compliance. 29 An impairment of systolic performance, besides the reduction in the longitudinal excursion, could imply a prolongation of systolic contraction reducing the effective protodiastolic filling time, further contributing to the diastolic function impairment. 31 The pathophysiological mechanism is demonstrated by the correlation found between the alteration of TAPSE and TAPSE duration (systolic impairment), the reduction of RVFT (effective diastolic filling) and the presence of PV a wave (diastolic compliance). This study illustrates, for the first time, the systolic and diastolic interrelation studied with echocardiography, in patients with ARDS without ACP, treated with different strategies and showing reproducible indices potentially preceding the RV failure. The recognition of early signs of RV dysfunction may have important implications in the clinical setting in terms of patient management. 38 ",
