Though data exists regarding effective triage of people during humanitarian crises (1), this is the first time that developed healthcare systems have been placed under sustained and at times overwhelming pressure. Emerging data has described the active management and outcomes of Covid-19 patients (2, 3, 4), however at present there is little information to help inform the management of those patients recognised as dying. The surge in people requiring care means services are stretched and finite resources must be allocated efficiently. Understanding the dying process in Covid-19 patients in an environment that presents additional challenges of potentially limited resource and comprehensive infection control precautions, is crucial in order to deliver high standards of care.",

The trust is based across two acute hospital sites in Worthing and Chichester and serves a population of 450,000 people, with a large proportion of older individuals and those living with frailty. We envisaged using the data to review the challenges faced during this pandemic and examine whether any patterns are arising, including unanticipated ones, to inform future care pathways. Even within an overburdened health system with finite resources, integrating palliative care is essential (5, 6) when looking at delivering the wider Covid-19 service, so that clinicians are able to provide the best standards of care to all our population.",

Data were extracted from medical and nursing notes (admission notes, electronic prescribing system and electronic records) by clinicians. Clinical frailty was assessed by the admitting doctor using the validated Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale (7) which is an assessment based on recent functional ability, and has been a routine part of the admission clerking in our Trust since 2015. Use of the T34 Mckinley Syringe Driver pumps to administer medication was recorded, along with drug and dose used. These syringe drivers are commonly used in the UK to continuously administer essential symptom control medications subcutaneously for patients at the end of life in order to provide good control of symptoms such as breathlessness and respiratory secretions. The work was registered with the hospital Clinical Effectiveness Team.",

These patients had a wide range of ages, and frailty scores although they tended to be younger and less frail on average. All however did have significant comorbidities. The second cohort, Group 2 (n=14) either had less severe symptoms at presentation or presented atypically and had a longer duration of illness and dying phase. These patients were all over 75 years and the majority were either moderately or severely frail, with none scoring less than 5 on their CFS. It could be that this frail group did not experience severe Covid-19 but instead that they were already extremely vulnerable and had limited abilities to overcome any illness which is a feature common to those we see dying of other causes with frailty. The duration of the dying phase in this cohort is similar to what we usually see in palliative care. A smaller number (Group 3, n=5) did not fit either of these groups; they too were elderly with multiple comorbidities but not necessarily frail prior to admission. They had a long duration of illness and length of hospital stay but a very rapid deterioration and dying phase. It could be that in this group the dying phase was simply not recognised as such for some time or that there was a super-imposed illness in an already vulnerable and deconditioned individual.",

Recognised Covid-19 symptoms such as cough, dyspnoea and anxiety, (10) as well as agitation and delirium are typically very distressing and therefore may well necessitate a higher proportion of patients being managed with syringe drivers to ease the symptom burden appropriately. Mean doses used however were comparable between this cohort and those seen in previous audits, and is consistent with data published from other centres (11). This suggests that although more patients appear to require these medications, their symptoms are controllable to the same extent as patients dying from other causes.",

The symptom burden may be higher than we typically see, as demonstrated by higher requirement for syringe drivers. It is therefore important to recognise this so patients diagnosed as dying can have access to early use of appropriate treatments to allow for a comfortable and dignified death. We perhaps need to acknowledge that in those with any symptoms requiring medication, there will be little benefit in delaying the introduction of a syringe driver once identified as dying. The recognition of the emerging phenotypes of dying, especially amongst vulnerable, comorbid and frail patients deemed not likely to benefit from critical care, will help clinicians in terms of modifying expectations and discussing prognosis with their families.",
