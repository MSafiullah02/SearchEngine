            "text": "This study analyzes the link between temperatures and COVID-19 contagions in a sample of Italian regions during the period ranging from February 24 to April 15. To that end, Bayesian Model Averaging techniques are used to analyze the relevance of the temperatures together with a set of additional climate, environmental, demographic, social and policy factors. The robustness of individual covariates is measured through posterior inclusion probabilities. The empirical analysis provides conclusive evidence on the role played by the temperatures given that it appears as the most relevant determinant of contagions. This finding is robust to (i) the prior distribution elicitation, (ii) the procedure to assign weights to the regressors, (iii) the presence of measurement errors in official data due to under-reporting, (iv) the employment of different metrics of temperatures or (v) the inclusion of additional correlates. In a second step, relative importance metrics that perform an accurate partitioning of the R 2 of the model are calculated. The results of this approach support the evidence of the model averaging analysis, given that temperature is the top driver explaining 45% of regional contagion disparities. The set of policy-related factors appear in a second level of importance, whereas factors related to the degree of social connectedness or the demographic characteristics are less relevant.",

Five weeks later, by April 15, more than 2 million people were infected in 185 countries. The size and strength of the epidemic outbreak has threatened the ability of many health-care systems all over the world to cope with a shock of unprecedented magnitude and produced a severe health crisis. In addition, although the economic impacts of the COVID crisis are yet uncertain, IMF forecasts projects that the \"Great Lockdown\" employed by governments to contain the disease in many countries is likely to cause a deeper recession than that of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, as the global economy is expected to contract sharply by 3 percent in 2020 (IMF, 2020) .",

From an empirical perspective, the strand of literature analyzing its determinants has highlighted the relevance of different factors in shaping regional reactions to COVID-19 epidemic, such as air pollution (AQR, 2020a; Pansini and Fonaca, 2020; Setti et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020) , social mobility and connectedness (Arenas et al., 2020; Pluchino et al., 2020; Kuchler et al., 2020) , population density (Fang and Wahba, 2020; AQR, 2020b) , the level of policy stringency and the timings of the lockdowns Orea and Alvarez, 2020; Casares and Khan, 2020) , or the effects of proactive testing (Wang et al., 2020b; Romer, 2020) among others.",

            "text": "These studies represent a substantial progress in understanding the link between climate and the spread of COVID-19 but an important methodological problem present in most of them, is that they have employed very limited sets of variables to analyze this phenomenon and ignored uncertainty surrounding the true model or data generating process (DGP) underlying COVID-19 contagions. From an econometric perspective, ignoring model uncertainty and omitting relevant explanatory variables that could affect COVID-19 patterns, is of major importance given that such estimates may be unreliable (Moral-Benito, 2015 , Steel, 2017 . Moreover, since it is often not clear a priori which set of variables are part of the \"true\" regression model, a naive approach that ignores specification and data uncertainty may result in biased estimates, overconfident (too narrow) standard errors and misleading inference and predictions. A second issue with existing analysis on COVID-19 is that they fail to derive a rank of the various factors in terms of their importance, thus, hampering the consensus on what policies could be implemented to increase resilience against this pandemic disease. Third, there is evidence on large cross-country differentials regarding the percentage of detection of COVID-19 cases achieved by each country, which makes difficult to compare existing cross-country incidence series (Russell et al., 2020) . These measurement errors are likely to plague and contaminate any crosscountry analysis and might be aggravated if the ability to test relative to the actual contagions is time-varying, or if there is a varying degree of under-reporting in the number of deaths due to the disease.",

This approach allows us to produce a probabilistic ranking of importance through the computation of posterior inclusion probabilities (PIP) for the different variables. 1 The set of potential determinants considered at the regional level includes: (i) institutional factors and variables related to the regional authorities' policy response to the epidemic, (ii) demographic factors, (iii) climatic, geographic and environmental characteristics and (iv) variables that capture the degree of social connectedness and mobility of the population. Thus, compared with the limited set of regressors analyzed in the existing empirical literature, this study assesses model uncertainty over a larger set of COVID-19 potential determinants while minimizing omitted variable bias and the multicollinearity concerns that could arise in a single model regression empirical framework. Hence, unlike previous studies using a small fraction of the information available in the data set to draw conclusions, we explore the model space formed by all the possible model combinations implied by the set of potential drivers. In addition, a Posterior Jointness analysis following Doppelhofer and Weeks (2009) is carried out with the aim of increasing our understanding on the factors that might behave as complementary or substitutes to the climate and policy effects on COVID-19 contagions.",

This research design has some advantages with respect a \"large N\" design. The first one is that the Italian Civil Protection Ministry (CPM) provides both, longer time-series but also more consistent, reliable and homogeneous regional data in the magnitudes of the health crisis (i.e, number of contagions, deaths, tests, etc) than other advanced countries. 2 Second, the fact that Italy was one of the countries that was hard hit in the first place by the COVID-19 pandemic, implies that by the time of performing this analysis, we can analyze the full evolution of the first wave of the epidemic, given that abrupt changes in the data are not likely to occur in the near future which could affect the conclusions. Third, by exploiting regional variation within a single country, we minimize the potential biases and problems of data comparability due to under-reporting differentials across countries and across time in both the incidence and death data (see, Russell et al. , 2020 for a discussion). Nonetheless, as the issue of under-reporting of cases is likely to create measurement errors even in relatively homogeneous sample, we verify if the results obtained are robust with respect to this potential problem. 3",

In the case of the Influenza, which is transmitted person to person in aerosol droplets typically through coughing and sneezing, the transmission is more efficient at cold temperatures and dry conditions.

In the case of SARS-CoV-2, which is also assumed to be propagated by droplets (WHO, 2020b), two main types of human to human transmission are likely to be at work. The first hypothesis suggests that viral particles emitted from the respiratory tract of an infected individual may land on a surface, another person could touch that object and then touch their nose, mouth or eyes, facilitating the virus to sneak into the body, thereby infecting the second person (WHO, 2020b) . The second is that of aerosol transmission. Aerosol transmission is biologically plausible when infectious aerosols are generated by or from an infectious person, the pathogen remains viable in the environment for some period of time, and the target tissues in which the pathogen initiates infection are accessible to the aerosol. Thus, it could be possible that people may emit virus particles in a range of sizes, some of them small enough to be considered aerosols, which can stay suspended in the air for hours and then be inhalated by others (Van Doremalen et al., 2020) .",

A first mediation mechanism is that of temperature and heat. The reason is that colder environments may increase viral transmission given that lower temperatures decrease metabolic functions and mucus secretion, which act as a defense barrier in hosts. Hair-like organelles outside of cells that line the body's airways, called cilia, do not function as well in dry and cold conditions and they cannot expel viral particles as well as they otherwise would. Secondly, temperatures can affect the transmission through the vehicle itself, the respiratory droplet, as the length of a time a droplet remains airborne depends on its size (Lowen and Steel, 2014) . In the winter season, when cold, dry air comes indoors and is warmed, the relative humidity indoors drops sharply, which makes it easier for airborne viral particles to travel. The intuition here is that heating systems increase indoor temperatures and dry-out the air, favoring the evaporation of droplets. In such circumstances, the stronger the evaporation, the smaller the diameter of the droplet, thereby enhancing the airborne suspension and the possibility of aerosol transmission in closed spaces.",

Firstly, the use of data at the NUTS-2 aggregation level allows us to built an homogeneous database on a larger number of potential drivers of contagions using distinct sources. Secondly, NUTS-2 is the territorial unit most commonly employed in the literature on regional analysis and it is particularly relevant in terms of Italian health-care regional policy, given that health competences in Italy are decentralized (Golinelli et al., 2017). 4 However, before continuing, it is necessary to stress that the quality of the available contagion data on COVID-19 is far from being optimal since the time-series on infections are affected by a severe share of under-reported cases and Italy is no exception in this regard (see, Russell et al., 2020) . The reason is that only the more severe cases (non-asymptomatic and non-mild) cases get sick enough to search medical help and have been officially diagnosed. Therefore, the quality of the data on contagions depends to a large extent on the fraction of cases that are severe enough to both lead to medical attention and be tested. Hence, by using this metric on contagions, we are measuring \"two phenomena at the same time\": the infected people and the authorities' ability to detect them. Note that although this point could be a major drawback in cross-country comparative research, it is reasonable to assume that within a country, these measurement errors do not differ significantly across regions, and as a consequence, these concerns are of less importance in this context. 5",

As observed, the figures increased substantially during March 2020, such that by March 21, all the regions in the country had more than 10 COVID-19 contagions per 100,000 inhabitants. Figure ( 1), the region that increased more rapidly the number of infections and crossed the 10 cases per 100,000 inhabitants threshold in a first place was Lombardy, on March 2. By March 24, Lombardy had more than 300 cases and from April 5 onwards, the figures in Lombardy located in the interval ranging from the 500 to 700 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The evolution of Lombardy was closely followed by the regions of Marche, Emilia-Romagna, Bolzano and Aosta Valley, who also experienced markedly increases, and before March 22, all the neighbors of Lombardy located in the north of the country reported more than 100 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. 6 This pattern of contagions confirms a rapid cross-regional diffusion such that most of the Italian regions arrived to their peak of contagions per capita during the last ten days of March and stabilized their growth rates during the first half of April. 7",

Given that there is a time lag between person to person transmission, the development of symptoms, the test realization and the confirmation of test results later on, we resort to a lagged value of temperatures to capture the fact that if present, climatic effects should have taken some time to exert an impact on contagions. For this reason, we employ the average temperatures in February of each regional centroid, obtained after averaging over the time series of daily mean temperatures at 2 meters above the surface of the earth. The meteorological data was taken from the NASA-Prediction Of Worldwide Energy Resources (NASA-POWER) v8 GIS database. Figure ( 2) panel (a) shows the geographical distribution of the total contagions per 100,000 inhabitants for each region in April 15. An interesting fact shown in Figure  ( 2) is that the geographical distribution of infections has been clearly asymmetric across regions. On the other hand, the information of temperatures is shown in the panel (b) of Figure ( 2). As the color scale range in each panel is set to reflect a higher value of the variable being mapped, the observation of Figure ( 2) reveals that higher cumulative incidence levels up to April 15, occurred in regions with lower temperatures in February. 8 To further investigate this link, Figure ( 3) provides a graphical illustration on the association between average daily temperatures and COVID-19 cumulative incidences 8 The corresponding regional NUTS-2 codings and regional names shown in the maps are: ITC1-Piedmont, ITC2-Aosta Valley, ITC3-Liguria, ITC4-Lombardy, ITF1-Abruzzo, ITF2-Molise, ITF3-Campania, ITF4-Apulia, ITF5-Basilicata, ITF6-Calabria, ITG1-Sicily, ITG2-Sardinia, ITH1-Autonomous Province of Bolzano, ITH2-Autonomous Provincce of Trento, ITH3-Veneto, ITH4-Friuli-Venezia Giulia, ITH5-Emilia-Romagna, ITI1-Toscana, ITI2-Umbria, ITI3-Marche, ITI4-Lazio",

This means that regions with higher temperatures tend to have lower levels of infections, while those regions with lower temperatures, on average, are characterized by a higher incidence. Indeed, the pairwise correlation between the two variables is statistically significant (\u03c1 = \u22120.723 with p-value = 0.00). 9 . Nonetheless, the information provided by Figure ( 3) should be treated with caution, as the observed connection between temperatures and the regional epidemic size may simply be a spurious correlation resulting from an ecological fallacy or the omission of other variables affecting both, climate and the infections.

Thus, compared to low-density areas, a higher population density could favor the interaction and personal contacts reinforcing the transmission of the virus (AQR, 2020b). Nevertheless, this argument should be taken with caution, as some extremely dense cities, such as Singapore, Seoul, and Shanghai, have outperformed many other less-populated places in combating the coronavirus.

In the context of the COVID-19 existing studies have failed to stablish a clear causal link between particulate pollution, contagion and the subsequent health damage (Pansini and Fonaca, 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a) . However, the intuition for a positive link is that airborne particles may have been able to serve as carrier for the pathogen (Setti et al., 2020) . Whether the virus remains viable after hitching a ride on pollution particles, or whether it can do so in sufficient amounts to cause infection is unclear. In any case, to control for this potential determinant, we account for (viii) environmental quality differentials. We measure the impact of environmental quality by means of the share of population that is exposed to more than 15 micrograms/m3 of particulate matter (PM2.5) using data from the OECD. Our expectation is that a higher pollution may have exerted a positive effect on the pandemic size. Makinen et al. (2009) find that in general, when the average temperature drops the estimated risk for the lower respiratory tract infections increases. Apart of the potential role of (ix) temperatures, another climatic factor that has received considerable attention in the literature is that of (ix) relative humidity (Oliveiros et al., 2020; Sajadi et al., 2020 , Wang et al., 2020c . As discussed in Section (2), we expect regions with lower temperatures and lower humidity to have a higher incidence as these two factors may have reduced the efficiency of viral transmission by decreasing host resistance in outdoor environments and increasing the stability of airborne viral particles in indoor spaces.",

This implies there are 2 K sub-structures of the model in Equation (1) given by subsets of coefficients \u03b7 k = \u03b1, \u03b2 k and combinations of regressors X k . 11 Model averaging techniques solves the question of variable importance and the effects of each regressor h by estimating all the candidate models implied by the combinations of regressors in X (or a relevant sample of them) and computing a weighted average of all the estimates of the corresponding parameter of X h (where the sub-index h here denotes a single regressor and not a model or a combination of regressors k).

However, although they provide valuable insight into the overall importance of single variable, they neglect the interdependence of inclusion and exclusion of variables. Thus, PIPs do not help to conclude if the importance of the variable is evenly spread out across all model specifications or if it is specific to a certain combination of explanatory variables. To gain insights into the interdependence of the inclusion of sets of different variables, several studies investigate the joint posterior of pairs of variables. Jointness reveals generally unknown forms of dependence. Positive jointness implies that regressors are complements, representing distinct but mutually reinforcing effects. On the other hand, negative jointness implies that explanatory variables are substitutes and capture similar underlying effects. To analyze this issue, we follow Doppelhofer and Weeks (2009) , who propose the use of log of a cross-product ratio of inclusion probabilities.

Nevertheless, it does not correct for the potential negative effect of endogeneity generated by reverse causal relationships, or measurement errors. The issue of reverse causal relationships is likely to be at work in the case of the proactive testing proxy variable, whereas measurement errors can be an issue in the dependent variable, the number of contagions per 100,000 inhabitants. Therefore, to minimize the potential problems caused by reverse causality relationships and the lack of an appropriate instrument, tests are measured with respect the total population during the first week of the epidemic (i.e, 6 weeks before the measurement of the dependent variable). On the other hand, the issue of measurement errors in the number of contagions is addressed in detail in Section (6.2.2).",

From a Bayesian perspective, variables with PIPs higher than others, reflect a higher importance as they are more likely to be part of the DGP and as such, they can be considered as a relevant piece in explaining contagion differentials across Italian regions. 13 As observed in Column (1) of Table ( 2), there is a small group of top variables conforming the group of important determinants. These are the mean temperatures (97.5%) and the policy lags (88%), which are both statistically significant at the 1% level. In the frontier of relevance/irrelevance we also find the variable measuring the relative humidity conditions, with a PIP of the 44%, but with a statistically significant effect on contagions. It is somehow surprising that none of the remaining factors considered, although display the expected signs and are mostly consistent with those obtained in the literature (i.e, a positive link between contagions and the share of old population, social mobility, population density and air pollution; and a negative one between the share of young, health spending and tests), do not appear to be relevant in explaining regional differentials across Italian regions.

However, this is not an issue here since the correlation between the PIPs and the pairwise correlation between contagions and the set of potential drivers, in this context is about 0.43.

This means that an increase in 1 Celsius degree in the mean regional temperature during February, decreased the number of total contagions per 100,000 inhabitants in April 15 by 34.29. Alternatively, the estimated standardized posterior mean coefficient in Column (3) reveals that on average, a 1 standard deviation shock to the temperatures (i.e, a change of about 4.3 celsius degrees, which is the difference in the temperatures between the average temperatures of Lombardy (ITC4) and Calabria (ITF6)) had the effect of decreasing the total number of contagions per 100,000 inhabitants by 147.54, which is the difference between the highly affected region of Marche (ITI3) and that of Tuscany (ITI1). Moreover, as shown in Column (4), the posterior sign positivity of the temperatures is 0.00%, which implies the parameter estimate is always negative irrespective of the model in which the variable appears. This negative effect of temperatures on regional contagions is in line with previous literature and supports the findings of Ma et al. (2020) , Oliveiros et al. (2020) , Sajadi et al. (2020) and Wang et al. (2020c) while contradicts those of Merow and Urban (2020) , Pedrosa (2020) and Yao et al. (2020) . As explained, before, the rationale for a negative effect of temperatures on the number of contagions has to do with the increased susceptibility of the hosts due to a slower metabolism decreasing their defenses, and the fact that in winter, when cold air comes indoors and is it warmed by our heating systems, the relative humidity indoors drops sharply facilitating airborne viral particles to travel and be transmitted from one person to another as an aerosol.",

To put this figure in context, this estimates imply that in Lombardy, implementing the full lockdown in March 1 instead of the 8 of March, would have decreased the total amount of cases by 32% decreasing the incidence toll from 62,153 cases to 42,226 cases. This result is lower than the estimates provided in the empirical study of Orea and Alvarez (2020) who find that for Spanish regions the implementation of the lockdown one week before the date it occurred, had a reduction effect of the cases of approximately the 50%.

Table ( 3) reports the posterior jointness relationships of the different determinants included in the analysis, as calculated by the metric proposed by Doppelhofer and Weeks (2009) . The investigation of the jointness is relevant from a policy-making perspective as it helps to better understand what regional factors may reinforce or hamper the efforts of increasing resilience against the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak. The main findings are as follows. We find evidence of both positive and negative jointness among contagion determinants. Significant positive jointness (with J > 1) is not restricted to variables considered significant by the PIPs. In this respect, a more complex explanation emerges, given that variables such as the health spending ratio to the GDP, which seems to decrease contagions, appears to be a strong substitute of policy lags and temperatures. This suggests that in the absence of a warm climate or a fast policy response, a higher health spending to GDP ratio could become a relevant factor to decrease contagions. This can be attributed to both, the higher ability of monitoring and isolating cases and the possibility to reduce \"nosocomial transmission\" because of an increased access to protection equipment. Other codependencies with respect the policy lags are worth mentioning. Conditional to a delayed implementation of the lockdowns, we observe that a pro-active testing policy to detect infections becomes a more relevant determinant and may help to decrease contagions. In addition to this, we find a high degree of substitutability between policy lags and social-mobility, which suggests that restrictions to mobility may produce a similar effect to those of the lockdown of the entire region. Therefore, there results of this posterior jointness analysis reveal that there is room for policy-makers to increase resilience against the epidemic. Place-based oriented policies aiming at increasing health-care capacities and resources, or investments that help workers and firms to adopt teleworking practices that reduce social mobility might be important for the 21 .

Importantly, from a frequentist inference perspective, the parameter of temperatures appears to be significant at the 5% level in all the models which reinforces our view on this variable being the most important driver.

To address this issue, we estimate the percentage of symptomatic COVID-19 cases reported in the Italian regions using case fatality ratio estimates, correcting for delays between confirmation-and-death following Russell et al. (2020). 16 These authors propose to proceed in this way because of in real-time, the division of cumulative deaths (D t ) by cases (C t ) leads to a biased estimate of the case fatality ratio (CFR), because of this calculation does not account for (i) delays from confirmation of a case to death, and (ii) under-reporting of cases. The approach used here to obtain an accurate estimate of the size of regional infections consists in two steps. First, we use an estimated distribution of the delay from hospitalisation-to-death for known cases that are fatal, which allows us to adjust the naive estimates of the CFR to account for these delays. 17",

Thus, if a region has a cCFR that is higher to this threshold value, it means that only a fraction of cases are being reported. In such case, the excess of the observed cCFR can be attributed to under-reporting. Specifically, under-reporting u of known cases is calculated for each region i and date 16 We do not attempt to estimate both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases as it is not clear yet what is the precise share of asymptomatic and in the context of the approach set out by Russell et al.

In addition, controlling for distances to Lombardy is relevant in the Italian context, given that regions in the south of the country or in the Mediterranean islands far away from Lombardy, tend to have better climatic conditions. We also control for the presence of comorbidities in the population as there is evidence that suggests that COVID-19 infections exerts a higher impact on those suffering from other health problems, such that their clinical evolution is usually worse (Guan et al., 2020) .

This variable is expected to capture differences in the degree of social mobility and connectedness within the region. The reason for including this variable is that despite the fact that the first outbreak could have struck anywhere, regions with large cities like Milan or Rome should have a bias to attracting them, mainly because they have commercial hubs and large transport nodes with a massive influx of tourism and travelers. Likewise, the use of public transport may have been a key factor in the rapid spread of COVID-19 (AQR, 2020b). Table (8) show the results obtained when the BMA analysis is performed again including these additional controls. As can be seen, only the temperatures, the policy lags, the distance to Lombardy and the relative humidity display statistically significant effects at the 5% level. Moreover, we find that the most relevant factor are the regional temperatures with a PIP of the 92.9% and with a coefficient that continues to be negative and statistically significant in all cases. Therefore, the newly-added controls do not alter the main result of the paper. 20 19 The EQI is built upon three different pillars that refer to the degree of impartiality, corruption and quality of public services and it is based on survey data about the perceptions and experiences of European citizens on the quality, impartiality and level of corruption in education, public health care and law enforcement.",

The term relative importance here refers to the contribution a variable makes to the prediction of contagions by itself and in combination with other predictor variables, which differs from classical statistical inference where a variable may explain only a small proportion of predictable variance and yet be considered very meaningful (Johnson and LeBreton, 2004) . To understand the intuition behind this approach recall that in the context of a cross-sectional regression, with n = 1, . . . , N , the R 2 informs on the model's explained variability across spatial units (regions). Thus, decompositions on the relative importance of a factor X k , tell us the percentage of explained disparities across spatial units due to factor k.",

Given that this variable also appears to be substitute of lockdowns, policies aiming at reducing the level of social mobility, as it is the case of adopting teleworking (working from home), could help to reduce daily commutes and the significant possibility of transmission in office environments. Thus, the expansion of teleworking may help reduce costs to the economy and society.",

From the methodological point of view, one option is the extension of the BMA framework employed here to the context of a dynamic spatial panel data model including fixed effects (Lee and Yu, 2010) or adaptive fixed effects (Shi and Lee, 2017) . This could allow to investigate probabilistic importance by exploiting not only cross-regional variation but also time-variation while controlling for unobserved heterogeneity. A second avenue of research consists in the development of a homogeneous and comparable cross-country regional dataset of contagions. This type of study will require the employment of correction methods such as the one we have implemented here. In the European context, high-frequency mortality monitoring data could allow to correct under-reporting in the deaths, which could be useful to further refine the methodology of Russell et al. (2020) .",

Their variable weights are in most of the cases the 99.9% or the 100%. Similarly, medium-relevance regressors appear above the low-importance ones in most of the scenarios, which implies a high level of accuracy. The variance of the residual does not appear to significantly affect the quality of the rankings based on FMA weights. However, the quality of the rankings appear to be dependent on the size of the sample of models S considered to derive the weights. This can be seen by looking at the quality of rankings produced with S=1000 and S=250. When the selection matrix S just considers a low number of models (i.e 250 models), a low-importance regressor z 8 may obtain a variable weight within the range of medium-level of importance regressors z 3 to z 6 . Despite this exception, we find that overall, the employment of FMA is accurate at ranking the groups of regressors by its importance.",

In the Monte Carlo experiments, data on the potential explanatory variables in Z = [\u03b9 n , z 1 , . . . , z 9 ] are generated from independent standard normal distributions. In the simulation study, Z is of dimension n \u00d7 10. We consider a sample size of n = 100 . The dependent variable y is generated according to the following data-generating process:Notice that by adjusting \u03c3 2 it is possible to control the signalto-noise ratio in the model. Values for \u03c3 2 are set to 1, 2, 5 and 10 in the different experiments, to asses the ability of the FMA approach to rank correctly the importance of z k \u2208 Z under different scenarios of the R 2 .The true slope coefficients \u03b2 k capturing the effect of z k in the data-generating process given by equation (19) are generated in a way such that the constant term and the first two (nonconstant) covariates z 1 and z 2 are likely to be important regressors in the model. Specifically, the corresponding coefficients are drawn from a normal distribution with mean zero and a relatively large variance of 10. The parameters corresponding to z 3 , z 4 , z 5 and z 6 are similarly drawn from a normal distribution with mean zero. However, with a level of 0.1, the variance for these parameters is set to be low, implying that these covariates are less likely to be important. The variance of the parameters related to z 7 , z 8 and z 9 is set to 0.00001to reflect the variables have a negligible influence on y.We focus on the Jackknife FMA approach based on different sizes of the selection matrix S of size s \u00d7 k + 1 for different sizes of s. Due to the computational burden, we use S instead of estimating the 2 k+1 models as in many empirical applications the enumeration of all the models might be quite time-consuming or infeasible. The design of S goes as follows. Each of the entries of S is filled by drawing from a Binomial distribution adjusted such that the expected probablity of z k being in the model is the 50% (i.e, by setting \u03c6 = 0.5 in p (z k ) = \u03c6 k (1 \u2212 \u03c6) K\u2212k , which governs the probability of inclusion for each z k and s. This implies that on average, the number of regressors in each model is 5 (i.e, each row of S i, * has 5 ones and 5 zeros). As the total number of model combinations with k + 1 = 10 is 1024 and in applied analysis with large numbers of regressors, storage of the full model space may require unfeasible RAM memory, we just consider scenarios where S < 2 k+1 . In particular we consider S=250, 500 and 1,000. ",
