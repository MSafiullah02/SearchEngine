The number of blue (coumarin fluorescent) cells, and their proportion relative to green (fluorescein fluorescent) cells, indicates the extent of inhibition of LF-\u03b2-lac internalization. This system accurately reports on the cellular uptake processes by which cells become intoxicated by anthrax PA and LF, which together constitute anthrax lethal toxin (LT). It should be noted that the LF-\u03b2-Lac has no toxicity.",

The endospores germinate following introduction to the body to cause a productive infection with incubation times ranging from 12 h to two weeks, and mortality rates in untreated cases ranging from 20% to more than 90%. B. anthracis forms endospores under adverse conditions that are usually present in the soil where infected animals died. The bacterium is simple to culture, and sporulation can easily be induced in a controlled laboratory setting. The endospores of B. anthracis are highly resistant to chemical insults, heat exposure, and dehydration, and remain infectious even after prolonged storage. These properties, combined with the high morbidity and mortality of anthrax, makes B. anthracis a significant threat as a bioterrorism agent, as illustrated by the effects of the deliberate contamination of mail with endospores in the fall of 2001.",

RAW264.7 cells were treated with varying amounts of a combination of PA and LF in the presence of increasing concentrations of compounds. Following incubation, cell viability was assessed using a colorimetric MTT reduction assay. Of the 30 compounds tested, seven offered significant protection from LF activity. Diphyllin (2) at 3 \u03bcM afforded nearly complete protection against the LF\u2013PA-mediated cell killing, while NCGC00084148-01 (designated 148-01) (1) and niclosamide (3) provide the same protection at \u223c10 \u03bcM (Fig. 3\n). The known kinase inhibitor GF 1092038 was also found to have protective effects on RAW264.7 cells; however, GF 109203 did not achieve the same potency or efficacy and was noted to be cytotoxic at concentrations above 10 \u03bcM. Additionally, we assayed the alkaloid and potent myelosuppressive homoharringtonine9 (designated 1A/61951), the KDO-8-P synthase inhibitor PD 40418210 (designated K4607) and 2-(4-methylpyrimidin-2-yl)benzo[d]isothiazol-3(2H)-one (designated 889-01). None of these other leads from the primary screen were noted as having protective effects on RAW264.7 cells. Given the strong protective effect demonstrated by diphyllin (2), we ascertained the protective effects of this agent across a concentration range of LT and after a 45 min pre-incubation of LT. The results show that diphyllin (2) is effective as a protective agent up to 1000 ng/mL concentrations of LT and demonstrates protective effects even after 45 min pre-exposure to LT (Fig. 4\n).",

FP59 kills cells by ADP-ribosylating the diphthamide residue on elongation factor-2 (EF-2).

It has previously been shown that pore formation is triggered by an acidification of the endosomal pH.14 To discriminate among these possibilities, we used PA receptor-deficient CHO PR230 cells transfected with either tumor endothelial cell marker 8 (TEM8) (PR230 TEM8-T4 cells) or capillary morphogenesis gene 2 product (CMG2) (PR230 CMG2-C4 cells).15, 16 Both TEM8 and CMG2 are well characterized PA receptors, but they differ significantly in their pH dependence for pore formation and LF translocation.15 The TEM8 receptor requires a relatively mild acidic environment (pH 6.0\u20136.5) to allow PA pore formation, while the CMG2 receptor requires a relatively low pH (5.5\u20136.0). Conversion of the SDS/heat-sensitive PA heptamer prepore to the SDS/heat-resistant functional LF-conductive pore requires acidic pH in endosomes.",

PA binding, proteolytic processing, PA heptamer formation, and PA-dependent LF binding to cells were assessed by SDS\u2013PAGE followed by Western blotting using PA and LF antibodies as described previously.5 None of the compounds blocked cellular binding, proteolytic processing, heptamerization of PA, or PA-mediated LF binding. In contrast, all four compounds disrupted heptamer prepore-to-pore conversion in CMG2-expressing cells to a degree comparable to bafilomycin, with markedly less effects on TEM8 expressing cells (Fig. 6\n). Interestingly, diphyllin displayed a modest effect on TEM8 cells. This trend was mirrored in the viabilities of the cells in the presence of each agent across a concentration gradient (Fig. 7\n). These results suggest that the protective effect of these agents is the result of preventing endosome acidification (most likely through the inhibition of V-ATPase action) or blocking of toxin trafficking to endosomes of increased acidity. It is possible to differentiate between these mechanisms through the use of pH sensors that allow direct quantification of endosomal acidity (these experiments were not performed). Importantly, Collier and coworkers recently demonstrated that selective mutagenesis of phenylalanine 427 of PA (a crucial residue for membrane transport of PA) produced variable effects on PA function.17 Selected mutants (F427K, F427R, F427D, F427G) were found to mitigate the pH-induced conformational change associated with pore formation. Other mutations (F427H, F427S, F427T) did not affect prepore-to-pore conversion but inhibited translocation of the LF construct. This study clearly demonstrates that small molecule intervention of cellular entry of the PA\u2013LF construct can occur through different mechanisms.",

That niclosamide (3) potentially acts as a V-ATPase inhibitor is possibility relevant to recent reports suggesting niclosamide may serve as a therapy for SARS-CoV infection.21 Niclosamide, found here to disrupt heptamer prepore-to-pore conversion in the pH sensitive CHO-CMG2 cell line, eliminated SARS-CoV viral antigen synthesis at modest concentrations (1.56 \u03bcM).22 The mechanism of niclosamide\u2019s effect on viral replication is unresolved; though modifications of niclosamide\u2019s core 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline substructure lead to inhibitors of the SARS 3CL protease23 (niclosamide had only weak inhibitory activity (IC50 40 \u03bcM)23, 24 against this target). The possibility that niclosamide (3) does act on V-ATPase is intriguing and may yield insight into its effect on viral entry. It should be noted that niclosamide (CID: 4477) appears as an active compound numerous times in the Pubchem online database.",

High-throughput screening of large chemical libraries can identify leads for such programs, but is costly and cumbersome to perform in restrictive biosafety level environments. Screening of pathogen pathways reconstituted in non-pathogenic cell types, coupled with rapid follow-up testing of active compounds in the pathogenic organism, offers an attractive alternative to direct pathogen screening.

Follow-up studies allowed the rapid triage of compounds that were inactive in physiological anthrax intoxication assays. These studies successfully identified compounds with activity not only in the original assay but also on LF-induced cell killing. Of the 30 compounds identified in the primary assay and tested in native LF cell killing assays, 7 (23%) protected against LF-induced macrophage killing. The clinically used teniacide niclosamide, (3) the natural product diphyllin, (2) and a novel chromeno[4,3-c]pyrazol-4(1H)-one (NCGC00084148-01) (1) all protected macrophages and CHO cells from cell death induced by PA combined with LF and diphtheria toxin. Since the primary assay detects compounds acting via a variety of mechanisms, a series of mechanism of action studies were undertaken on three selected active compounds, NCGC00084148-01 (1), diphyllin (2) and niclosamide (3). All three compounds were found to protect CHO cells from the fusion toxin FP59 and from cell killing by diphtheria toxin (which utilizes a different receptor and does not require PA for endocytosis), suggesting that the compounds interfere with toxin internalization. Blockade of PA heptamer prepore-to-pore conversion was then measured in two cell lines where endosomal pH requirements differ. All three compounds influenced heptamer prepore-to-pore conversion at the same concentrations which affect cell viability of each cell line and to a degree comparable to the known vacuolar (H+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) inhibitor bafilomycin. These results suggest a mechanism for NCGC00084148-01 (1), diphyllin (2) and niclosamide (3) that is directly linked to endosome acidification (either inhibition of V-ATPase function or blocking of toxin internalization and/or trafficking to endosomes of increased acidity).

Percent activity was computed from the median values of the uninhibited, or neutral, control set and a set of control wells containing no LF/PA. For assignment of plate concentrations and sample identifiers, ActivityBase (ID Business Solutions Ltd, Guildford, UK) was used for compound and plate registrations. An in-house database was used to track sample concentrations across plates. Correction factors were generated from control assay plates containing vehicle (DMSO) only inserted uniformly throughout the screen to monitor background systematic variation in assay signal potentially resulting from issues with reagent dispensers or decrease in enzyme specific activity. Curve fitting was performed using an in-housed developed algorithm. A four parameter Hill equation was fitted to the concentration\u2013response data by minimizing the residual error between the modeled and observed responses. Outliers were identified and masked by modeling the Hill equation and determining if the differences exceeded those expected from the noise in the assay.",

Curves are classified as negative or positive depending on whether they exhibit signal decrease (apparent inhibition) or increase (apparent activation). Translocation inhibitors are noted as negative response curves in the blue emission channel, and as flat responses in the green channel. Natively fluorescent molecules were noted to stimulate both channels. A negative response in both channels typically indicates non-specific fluorophore quenching or non-specific mechanisms of inhibition, such as cellular apoptosis. The ratio of the green and blue channels normalizes for variation in cell number, is a more robust measure of compound performance, and further allows compounds to be classified as potential inhibitors of LF translocation.",

For each cluster, maximal common substructures (MCS) were extracted, and a manual step of trimming the MCSs was performed to create a list of scaffolds. This clustering step typically has overlapping compounds and thus can lead to overlapping MCSs. This list of trimmed scaffolds is abridged to a canonical set. Each scaffold is then represented as a precise definition to indicate number of attachments, ring size variability, etc. All filters were then relaxed to include all negative assay data. In the initial clustering, a set of singletons was found. These compounds were reported upon separately with their individual activity profiles. SAR series and singletons were finally ranked by their activity profile, including the average potency and efficacy of the series. The primary screening results can be viewed in the PubChem database (AIDs 912 and 942, http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).",
