Most of these institutions are SMEs, comprising 255 companies (81% of all institutions), and most of these SMEs are based in North America (United States and Canada; 56%) and Europe (including Israel; 36%). European SMEs were found most often in the United Kingdom, followed by France, Switzerland, Denmark and the Netherlands (Fig. 2b). Although we could not verify the exact number of employees at SMEs in 5% of cases, at least 60% of all included SMEs are very small companies with fewer than ten employees. Ninety per cent of the SMEs with a known number of employees (n = 243) are small companies with fewer than 50 employees. Only 5% of the SMEs have more than 100 employees but fewer than 500 employees. These numbers show that the great majority of the world\u2019s preclinical antibacterial pipeline is in the hands of very small companies with very limited financial (and workforce) resources.",

A few have additional discovery projects in other anti-infective areas (for example, antivirals). Some SMEs work in one or more additional therapeutic areas, especially immuno-oncology and/or inflammation. The distribution of these three categories (only antibacterial therapy, only the anti-infective field, or both antibacterial and other therapeutic areas) is similarly distributed among European and North American SMEs.",

Most academic institutions were excluded as their projects were not advanced enough to meet the inclusion criteria. Very few global pharmaceutical corporations have active clinical development programmes according to their published pipelines (for example, Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Medimmune/AstraZeneca, Genentech/Roche). Most of these companies are not active in preclinical antibacterial research and development, although it is possible that the companies are especially adept at keeping their programmes confidential and did not apply for funding. The large pharmaceutical companies (more than 1,000 employees) included in this study and engaging in preclinical antibacterial research and development are mainly located in Asia and Europe and have a regional focus. From our review of the data, these particular preclinical projects do not represent a renaissance in interest by large companies in antibiotic resistance. Therefore, SMEs carry out the great majority of the pipeline, with few employees and dependence on one programme or technology. This vulnerability is commonly characterized not only by a narrow set of expertise and dependence on the success of a single or a few similar prioritized projects, but also by the need for continued flow of funding, mostly grants, as private funding is relatively modest in preclinical antibacterial research and development. This situation causes high volatility of the number of SMEs and threatens the stability of the early pipeline.",

            "text": "One hundred and eighty-seven projects involve traditional antibacterial agents that directly target bacteria by inhibiting or killing them without requiring any additional therapy. Characteristically, these compounds are synthesized or natural chemicals of mostly small size and they follow a traditional, well-known regulatory development pathway. These direct-acting drugs can be further classified into three groups: improved derivatives of known antibiotic classes (old targets), new chemical classes with new targets and unknown or undefined agents with unclear targets (Fig. 4a). The group of old targets (n = 35, 19%) includes \u03b2-lactams and other inhibitors of penicillin-binding proteins, fluoroquinolones and novel bacterial topoisomerase inhibitors, aminoglycosides, polymyxins and macrolides16. One hundred and thirty-five projects (72%) are focused on new targets, including synthetic and natural antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), natural products and LpxC inhibitors (as discussed below). Other new targets include new binding sites in the bacterial ribosome, the membrane, the cell wall, transcription and/or translation, gene interference and metabolism17\u201320. Some of these targets and scaffolds were described a long time ago but were not pursued to clinical development. Seventeen projects involving direct-acting agents could not be grouped due to insufficient information. Almost half of the projects are focused broadly on Gram-negative bacteria (enterobacteria and non-fermenters), and ~10% are focused on Gram-positive bacteria (mostly staphylococci), which are not a critical priority according to the WHO priority list21. The cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria is an effective barrier to molecules that need to penetrate the outer and inner membranes. Therefore, the scientific challenges for targets residing in the cytoplasm or inner membrane are greater than those for novel targets located in the periplasm or in the outer membrane. Not surprisingly, there is a noticeable trend towards targets in the outer membrane in preclinical projects. As mentioned before, in early drug discovery the spectrum of activity cannot be defined exactly and may change during the lead optimization phase. About 22% of the projects involve pathogen-specific approaches (mostly against Gram-negative bacteria) and thus face specific challenges to recruit enough patients for phase III trials compared with trials of drugs with a broader spectrum. About 10% of the projects have a broad spectrum covering a broad range of both Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria (Fig. 4b).",

            "text": "Within the group of direct-acting compounds, three defined clusters are noticeable: synthetic or natural AMPs, natural products and LpxC inhibitors. The naturally abundant and diverse AMPs are a well-known group of antibacterials and are the basis for semisynthetic peptide molecules and peptidomimetics18,22\u201325. Such renewed interest in this group may help to overcome some of the obstacles of AMPs such as high cost of synthesis, short half-life in vivo due to their susceptibility to proteolytic degradation and issues with toxicity26. Natural products are mainstays of our current antibiotic arsenal, exemplified by the large group of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines and macrolides. Modern technologies such as genome mining contribute to the discovery of new scaffolds, and technical innovations are revealing new chemistry and increased yields, all of which contribute to the revival of natural product programmes27\u201329. LpxC inhibitors, which target the first dedicated step in the synthesis of lipid A, have been explored since the mid-1990s but no drug has advanced yet beyond phase I clinical trials. Development of ACHN-975 was discontinued after a phase I trial, owing to local inflammation at the injection site and some toxicity signals in the mouse model30\u201332. A trial involving RC-01, another LpxC inhibitor, was recently terminated for safety reasons33. Despite LpxC being a good target, toxicity of the used chemical matter seems to be a major challenge, but a growing body of knowledge and experience may help to overcome some of the current hurdles, including recent donations facilitated by CARB-X of toxicology data on the recently failed LpxC inhibitor into the public domain (the Shared Platform for Antibiotic Research and Knowledge (SPARK), Pew Trusts). In general, novel targets or novel chemicals carry the risk of unpredictable toxicity, because the translatability of safety signals from preclinical models to humans is uncertain, as exemplified by the aforementioned LpxC inhibitor RC-01 (ref.32). The recent termination of the phase III clinical trial of the novel Pseudomonas aeruginosa-specific LptD inhibitor murepavadin due to higher than expected rates of acute kidney injury demonstrates the challenges of unexpected toxicity of a new chemical that was not predicted from earlier preclinical studies or from studies in healthy individuals34.",

Although extensively researched, no inhibitor of various efflux pumps38 has been clinically developed so far39. Five efflux inhibitors targeting different efflux pumps are included in this list of potentiators. Other approaches in the preclinical pipeline are potentiators that expand the spectrum (for example, developing Gram-negative activity from anti-Gram-positive drugs), enhance the activity substantially, restore the activity against resistant bacteria or protect against nephrotoxicity of nephrotoxic antibiotics, such as colistin or aminoglycosides.",

            "text": "Phage therapies have garnered a lot of attention lately due to the successful treatment of a small number of individual patients with chronic conditions limited to a small number of experimental treatment centres, often in compassionate use programmes10,41,42. Compassionate use of personalized phage preparations is limited to specific clinical circumstances and individual physicians and researchers who have experience with phage therapy42. Patient-specific phage cocktails allow the use for rare pathogens, whereas recombinant lysins may cover a broader spectrum of Gram-negative bacteria. Although phages have been used historically in topical formulations (mostly skin)43, phage preparations are being developed for intravenous, aerosol or diverse locally applied formulations44. The immense size of phages compared with small-molecule antibiotics poses pharmacokinetic challenges, and important scientific questions remain regarding availability at the site of infection and determining the best dosing regimen45. In general, natural and engineered phage cocktails dominate our sample. New genetic tools such as CRISPR\u2013Cas systems are used to genetically engineer phages that infect diverse hosts46. Phages are also used as species-specific carriers for a variety of potential antibacterial payloads47 or CRISPR\u2013Cas-based RNA-guided nucleases targeted at resistance or virulence determinants48,49. Considerable progress has been made recently in tackling the great challenges in the chemistry, manufacturing and control of therapeutic phages, especially in production, stability, purity and quality control. However, challenges remain, such as unique phage biology and specificity, pharmacokinetics of large self-replicating agents, rapid resistance development and translation to a broader group of patients beyond compassionate use8. Also, patient-specific phage therapy requires a highly developed diagnostic infrastructure (with phage-specific rapid testing). Phage therapies will likely be restricted to well-defined situations in individual patients or as adjunctive therapy with all the challenges related to clinical superiority trials that compare a usually highly effective standard of care and adjunctive therapy versus standard of care alone50,51.",

Microbiota-modifying therapies have been explored and tested in patients using the entire healthy microbiota to correct major imbalances and reduce the recurrence of C. difficile infection57. Such programmes have recently faced a setback as one patient died because of faecal transplants that contained drug-resistant bacteria58 and led to the halting of clinical trials by the FDA. It is not fully known yet how this incident will affect regulation by the FDA and consequently the entire field of faecal transplants or similar strategies. There is a trend towards reducing the complexity of faecal transplants by controlling the transfer of bacterial strains or selecting natural strains derived from a healthy microbiota59,60. New techniques based on synthetic biology and systems biology allow the precise genetic engineering of well-known probiotics61, which may also express specific antibacterial substances62\u201364. A long-known strategy to maintain a healthy microbiota is the use of antibiotic inactivators or absorbers of bacterial toxins in the gut. Examples include enzymes that inactivate residues of specific systemic antibiotics in the gut to reduce disbalance of the microbiota caused by antibiotic therapy or absorbers of bacterial toxins that may cause disease, such as toxins produced by C. difficile or other pathogens64,65. Both strategies still need to prove their value in the clinical situation51.",
