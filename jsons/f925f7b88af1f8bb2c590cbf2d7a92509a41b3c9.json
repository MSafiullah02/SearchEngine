The paper provides useful guidance regarding triage and timing of interventions for patients awaiting SHD treatment during this global crisis. However, we believe the possible downsides of performing (high-risk) cardiovascular interventions during this period require additional discussion. These considerations should be more explicitly incorporated in any framework addressing interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

For inpatients who cannot be discharged due to medical reasons, it is rational to perform necessary interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic, analogous to recommendations from the consensus statement (1). Conversely, for outpatients, risks for sudden cardiac death or irreversible cardiac deterioration while awaiting intervention should be weighed against the risks of nosocomial COVID-19 exposure and associated morbidity and mortality. Although the chances of nosocomial COVID-19 transmission in this setting are largely unknown and are being investigated (2), the possibility is factual and well reported (3, 4) .",

Also, the expansion and improvement of testing to identify asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers will be crucial for optimal case selection.
