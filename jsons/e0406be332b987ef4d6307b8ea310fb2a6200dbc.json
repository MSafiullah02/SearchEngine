Because the patient had a long time from the onset of symptoms to the first CT examination (8 d), and the condition was critical at that timepoint, the lung opacities on CT appeared quite serious, involving both lungs, mainly in the posterior aspects and lower lobes. In the second week, due to the serious condition of the patient, CT could not be performed. The chest radiograph showed that the pulmonary ground-glass opacities and consolidations were still extensive. However, in the third week after onset, the lung opacities gradually regressed. CT is helpful in delineating pneumonia due to the novel coronavirus, but it is difficult to differentiate from pneumonitis due to other viruses. The accurate diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection relies on epidemiological investigation and laboratory data.",
