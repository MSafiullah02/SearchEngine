            "text": "Despite these important advantages, the Achilles heel of the affinity tagging strategy always has been and remains the removal of tags. Whereas many tagged proteins retain their structural integrity and biological activity, others clearly do not, e.g., [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. Therefore, whenever possible, it is prudent to remove tags from recombinant proteins. Although both chemical and enzymatic methods have been used to cleave fusion proteins at designed sites, only the natural proteolytic enzymes have the requisite specificity to be broadly useful reagents for this purpose. Because they are not as versatile and therefore generally less useful than trans-acting reagents, neither the self-cleaving inteins [12] and self-cleaving variants of subtilisin [13] will be discussed here, nor will the Ulp1 protease since it only cleaves SUMO tags [14]. Rather, this review will focus on the most generally applicable and commonly used enzymatic reagents for the removal of affinity tags (Table 1\n). Since the last comprehensive review of this topic [3] much research on these reagents has been conducted. As a result, a wealth of new information has accumulated on the advantages, disadvantages, and biochemical characteristics of various reagents.",

Although originally purified from natural sources [20], [21], recent advances have facilitated the production of a recombinant enteropeptidase light chain in the periplasm of E. coli\n[22], [23], making it more economical to manufacture and yielding a product free of contaminating proteases. Moreover, the 26 kDa light chain (which, when expressed in E. coli, is devoid of glycosylation) retains the specificity of the native enzyme and is even more active on fusion protein substrates than the heterodimer [22]. The availability of recombinant enteropeptidase also presents an opportunity for the attachment of affinity tags to the enzyme to facilitate its purification and separation from the products of an enteropeptidase digest [24]. One drawback of enteropeptidase, however, is that the light chain contains 4 disulfide bonds that are essential for catalytic activity, thus this enzyme is incompatible with buffers containing reducing agents like dithiothreitol (DTT). On the other hand, a recent study showed enteropeptidase to be relatively insensitive to a wide variety of detergents [25], which may enhance its value as a tool for the production of membrane proteins.",

Consequently, when an affinity tag is joined to the N-terminus of the protein of interest, in most cases enteropeptidase is able to generate a digestion product with a native N-terminus. A comprehensive study examining the relative processing rates of otherwise identical fusion proteins with all twenty possible amino acids in the P1\u2032 position confirmed this property of enteropeptidase and revealed the rank order of processing efficiency [26]. Only proline and tryptophan were not well tolerated in the P1\u2032 position. Another study examining the importance of the P1\u2013P5 positions concluded that the P1 lysine was the most important specificity determinant, followed by the aspartate residues in the P2, P3, P5 and P4 positions, respectively, with the latter position contributing very little to specificity [27]. Interestingly these investigators found that the sequence DDDDR was cleaved more efficiently than the canonical DDDDK.",

The optimum temperature for thrombin activity is 45 \u00b0C and the enzyme maintains 20% of its maximal activity at 15 \u00b0C [35]. Thrombin is active over a pH range of 5\u201310, with a pH optimum of about 9.5 in the absence of NaCl and 8.3 in the presence of 1 M NaCl [35]. At pH 8.3, its activity increases with rising NaCl concentration up to at least 1 M. Glycerol and polyethylene glycol (PEG 600) enhance the stability of thrombin.

Later, in their seminal paper describing the first application of glutathione S-transferase (GST) as an affinity tag, Smith and Johnson replaced the P2\u2032 phenylalanine in the factor VIII sequence with a serine residue purely for the purpose of creating a BamHI restriction endonuclease cleavage site that would facilitate the construction of GST fusion proteins [37]. After that, LVPR\u2193GS was universally espoused as the canonical thrombin cleavage site, irrespective of whether or not BamHI was utilized for cloning, e.g., [38]. Therefore, it is possible this is not the linear epitope that is most efficiently cleaved by thrombin.",

Proline and the negatively charged amino acids greatly diminished processing efficiency when present in the P2\u2032 position of peptide substrates (the \u201ccanonical\u201d serine was not tested in this study). The identity of the residue in the P3\u2032 position was not nearly as influential, although the negatively charged residues were most inhibitory. In another study, little bias was observed in the P2 and P3 sites, except for the exclusion of acidic residues. Interestingly, a strong preference was found for serine in the P1\u2032 position, in contrast to the \u201ccanonical\u201d glycine, which was a distant fourth, after alanine and threonine [40]. When a large library of different peptide sequences was screened for thrombin cleavage, the results revealed that the P1 arginine is the most conserved residue, followed by the P1\u2032 glycine [41]. Yet a remarkable level of promiscuity was observed, consistent with reports of cleavage at cryptic sites in fusion proteins [42]. The nominal requirement for a Gly-Ser dipeptide in the P1\u2032 and P2\u2032 positions, which would result in the retention of two nonnative residues on the N-terminus of the protein of interest following thrombin digestion, is a marked disadvantage of thrombin relative to enteropeptidase.",

Aligning the sequences of experimentally determined processing sites suggested that the recognition site for TEV protease is a linear epitope consisting of seven amino acid residues. This conjecture was confirmed by demonstrating that the sequence ENLYFQ\u2193S could function as a TEV protease cleavage site when placed in an artificial context [54] and led to the realization that TEV protease might be a useful reagent for the removal of affinity tags by site-specific endoproteolysis [55].",

            "text": "The specificity determinants of TEV protease have been thoroughly investigated. Early experiments by Dougherty and colleagues demonstrated a strong preference for glutamic acid in the P6 position of a TEV protease recognition site, little or no selectivity in the P5 position, a moderate preference for leucine in the P4 position, a strong preference for tyrosine in the P3 position, a roughly equal tolerance for phenylalanine, cysteine and isoleucine in the P2 position (with all other residues being poorly tolerated in this position), a strong bias in favor of glutamine in the P1 position, and some degree of selectivity in the P1\u2032 position, with serine, isoleucine, and asparagine being the most favorable of the residues tested [66]. These results led to the notion that the \u201cconsensus\u201d TEV protease cleavage site could be defined as Glu-Xaa-Xaa-Tyr-Xaa-Gln\u2193Ser/Gly and the assumption that those positions denoted as \u201cXaa\u201d could be freely substituted. However, more recent experiments have shown that TEV protease is quite sensitive even to conservative amino acid substitutions in the P4 and P2 positions [67]. In another study, the P1\u2032 specificity of TEV protease was systematically assessed in the context of a model fusion protein [68]. These investigators found that the enzyme was surprisingly tolerant of a wide variety of residues in this position. Small aliphatic residues such as glycine, alanine, serine, methionine, and cysteine were exceptionally well tolerated, whereas the negatively charged and \u03b2-branched hydrophobic residues were inhibitory to processing. These findings upended the dogma that a serine or glycine residue is essential in the P1\u2032 position of a TEV protease recognition site, revealing instead that, like enteropeptidase and factor Xa, in many cases TEV protease is capable of generating digestion products with native N-termini. As noted, the discrepancies between early and later results are probably due to differences in the experimental methods employed [68]. In the initial studies carried out by Dougherty and colleagues, the concentration of enzyme (which was the full-length NIa protein rather than the 27 kDa catalytic domain) exceeded that of the substrates, which were far below the K\nM of the enzyme. Later experiments were conducted under more realistic reaction conditions, using pure preparations of enzyme and substrate with a substantial molar excess of the latter. An important footnote to early studies of TEV protease specificity that is sometimes overlooked by today\u2019s protein engineers is that proline (but no other residue) is decidedly inhibitory in the P2\u2032 position of its substrates [66]. Other studies in which large combinatorial libraries of peptides have been interrogated by TEV protease are in good general agreement with the results of systematic mutagenesis experiments [69], [70].",

            "text": "The crystal structure of catalytically inactive (C151A) TEV protease in complex with the peptide substrate TTENLYFQSGT revealed that although the P7, P2\u2032 and P3\u2032 residues were clearly visible in the electron density map, their side chains do not engage in any noteworthy interactions with the enzyme (no density was observed for the P8 threonine residue) [71]. Of the side chains in the P6\u2013P1\u2032 positions of the peptide, only that of P5 asparagine does not make intimate contact with the enzyme, consistent with the observed lack of sequence specificity at this position [66]. The tolerance for a wide variety of side chains in the P1\u2032 position of TEV protease substrates [68] is possible because the S1\u2032 \u201cpocket\u201d of the enzyme is actually a long, shallow groove on its surface. Consequently, the side chain of the P1\u2032 residue is partially exposed to solvent rather than completely buried within the complex (Fig. 1\nA). This is not a general property of potyviral proteases, however. In the co-crystal structure of the related (53% amino acid identity) tobacco vein mottling virus (TVMV) protease with its canonical peptide substrate, the S1\u2032 pocket is small and round and the side chain of the P1\u2032 serine residue projects directly into it (Fig. 1B) [72]. Hence, from a biotechnological standpoint, it is fortuitous that TEV protease, with its relaxed P1\u2032 specificity, emerged as a reagent of choice for removing affinity tags.",

It is active over a pH range between 6 and 9, but inactive at or below pH 5 [63]. In the same study, the enzyme was reported to be relatively insensitive to NaCl concentrations between 0.1 and 2.0 M. In a later study, TEV protease activity was observed to be greatest in the absence of monovalent salt, but decreased only moderately at NaCl concentrations up to 200 mM [73]. Although the optimum temperature for TEV protease activity is 30\u201334 \u00b0C, the enzyme retains significant activity at 4 \u00b0C [73], [74]. Activity drops off abruptly above 37 \u00b0C, probably due to denaturation of the enzyme [73]. TEV protease is not inhibited by 2.5% sucrose or 0.1% Triton X-100, but is completely inactivated by 0.01% sodium dodecyl sulfate [75]. The enzyme is insensitive to the protease inhibitors PMSF, AEBSF, and pepstatin A, relatively tolerant of aprotinin (up to 0.3 mg/ml) and leupeptin (up to 100 \u03bcM), and can tolerate up to 0.5 M urea [75], [76]. Its catalytic activity is impeded by some detergents, however [25], [77], [78]. TEV protease activity is not impeded by reducing agents such as dithiothreitol (DTT) or chelators like EDTA, but, as expected, it is highly sensitive to thiol alkylating agents like iodoacetamide [75].",

The same is true of the 3C-like proteases encoded by related viruses that cause polio, hepatitis A, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), among other diseases. Indeed, the poliovirus 3C protease was among the earliest enzyme of its type to be characterized [84], [85], [86]. It is not entirely clear why human rhinovirus 14 3C protease emerged from this group of picornaviruses as the prototypical enzyme for endoproteolytic removal of affinity tags from recombinant proteins. Similarly, there seems to be no compelling reason why TEV protease was selected for this role from among well over one hundred potyviruses that infect plants. In both cases, it may simply be a matter of happenstance. In any event, the tobacco etch virus and the human rhinovirus are members of the same viral superfamily [87], [88].

Rhinovirus 3C protease has also been fused to His6 and MBP tags in E. coli\n[90], to DsbA [91], and very recently to the biotin acceptor peptide (BAP) [92]. The yield of BAP-tagged 3C was reported to be \u223c6 mg/g of wet cell paste. However, only about 60% of the BAP-tagged 3C protease was biotinylated in vivo (inexplicably, it was purified by conventional methods instead of by affinity chromatography on monomeric avidin resin). The yields of other tagged forms of the enzyme have not been reported. Unfortunately, rhinovirus 3C expression vectors are not presently available from open plasmid repositories, making them somewhat difficult to acquire.",

            "text": "Knowledge about the substrate specificity of human rhinovirus 3C protease has been gained mainly through studies of the enzyme from serotype 14. One comparative analysis of peptide substrates derived from natural 3C cleavage sites in the rhinovirus polyprotein established that the 2C/3A site was cleaved most efficiently [93] and that the specificity determinants are confined to the P5\u2013P2\u2032 sites [94], leading to the conclusion that the sequence ETLFQ\u2193GP is the optimum recognition site. At about the same time and using a very similar approach, a different group found that the 3B/3C cleavage site was the most efficiently processed of the natural sites [95] and that the specificity determinants are confined to the P5\u2013P2\u2032 sites [19], leading them to identify a different consensus sequence: PVVVQ\u2193GP. However, the canonical recognition site identified in the product literature accompanying PreScission\u2122 protease is LEVLFQ\u2193GP. Walker and colleagues [90] speculated that this unnatural recognition site may have evolved in part from the observation that the peptide EVLFQPG was hydrolyzed nearly five times more efficiently than the parental ETLFQGP peptide derived from the natural 2C/3A polyprotein processing site [94]. In the same study, a longer peptide encompassing the 2C/3A processing site (DSLETLFQGPVYKDL) was cleaved about twice as efficiently as the shorter ETLFQGP peptide. Although the longer peptide includes the natural leucine residue in the P6 position, there was insufficient data to conclude that its presence (rather than some other difference between the two peptides) was responsible for the observed twofold variation in processing efficiency. Yet in a more recent study, replacing a leucine in the P6 position of a peptide substrate with an arginine led to a 10-fold reduction in the catalytic efficiency (k\ncat/KM) of processing by rhinovirus 3C protease [96]. Hence, it seems that the octapeptide LEVLFQPG, the so-called \u201cPreScission protease site\u201d, approximates the optimum recognition site. Although, as discussed above, two groups arrived at somewhat different conclusions regarding the optimum sequence for a rhinovirus 3C protease cleavage site, both were in agreement on one key point: the requirement for the Gly-Pro dipeptide immediately after the scissile bond is very stringent. This is a noteworthy disadvantage of 3C compared to TEV protease; there is virtually no opportunity to produce a recombinant protein with a native N-terminus after digesting a fusion protein with 3C protease. There have been no \u201csubstrate protease\u201d experiments performed with 3C protease (i.e., no genetic selections or screens), and consequently the identity of the \u201cideal\u201d 3C cleavage site rests entirely on the systematic mutagenesis studies.",

The tagged protein of interest (POI) is first purified from a soluble extract by some type of affinity chromatography, depending on the tag that is used.

The problem of cleavage at secondary sites has been mitigated to a large degree by the use of viral proteases with very stringent sequence specificity. Still, it is not uncommon to encounter a situation where a fusion protein is cleaved very inefficiently by the chosen protease. There are several possible reasons for this. The most trivial explanation can be attributed to a failure to recognize the incompatibility of certain proteases with buffer components and additives. For example, a calcium-dependent protease such as factor Xa should never be used to cleave a fusion protein in a phosphate buffer (the most common buffer used for the purification of His-tagged proteins) because of the potential for the formation of insoluble calcium phosphate.",

For example, the cleavage site may be too close to ordered structure in the target protein. An example of such a situation is illustrated in Fig. 3\n. In this case, the substrate is an MBP-SycH fusion protein. SycH is an export chaperone for the protein tyrosine phosphatase YopH in Yersinia pestis, the plague-causing bacterium. When SycH is expressed in E. coli as a fusion to the C-terminus of MBP, with a TEV protease recognition site between the two domains, the fusion protein is not cleaved very efficiently (Fig. 3A). (In this experiment, the fusion protein was cleaved in vivo, using a separate plasmid expression vector to produce TEV protease [110].) In a second-generation construct, five glycine residues were inserted between the TEV protease recognition site and the N-terminus of SycH. As shown in Fig. 3B, this results in much more efficient processing of the fusion protein by TEV protease. However, no crystals of SycH with the additional glycine residues appended to its N-terminus were ever obtained. Instead, the form of SycH that was eventually crystallized had no extra residues added to its N-terminus. The structure revealed that the N-terminus of SycH is an integral part of the folded protein [111], consistent with the hypothesis that the close proximity of the TEV protease recognition site to the (structured) N-terminus of SycH in the original fusion protein was responsible for its failure to be cleaved efficiently and that the addition of five glycine residues alleviated this impediment.",

Digestive carboxypeptidases can be classified on the basis of their sequence specificity. For example, type A carboxypeptidases preferentially remove C-terminal amino acid residues having aromatic or branched aliphatic side chains [117] whereas type B carboxypeptidases exhibit a strong preference for basic amino acids [118]. However, carboxypeptidase B will remove aromatic residues under certain conditions [119], [120]. The A-type carboxypeptidases are further subdivided into type A1 and type A2 isoforms in rodents and humans [121]. Carboxypeptidase A1 preferentially catalyzes the removal of aliphatic residues from peptide substrates, while the A2 isoforms show higher specificity toward aromatic residues like phenylalanine and tryptophan. Carboxypeptidase A2 is not present in the bovine pancreas. Instead, the single bovine carboxypeptidase A (BoCPA) has relatively broad substrate specificity [121]. Exoproteolytic removal of C-terminal His-tags and polyarginine tags from globular proteins has been achieved using BoCPA and bovine carboxypeptidase B (BoCPB), respectively [116], [122], [123], [124], [125], [126], [127], [128], [129]. Neither enzyme will digest a C-terminal proline residue. Thus, incorporation of a proline at the appropriate location is one way to ensure that the digestion product will have a homogeneous endpoint.",

            "text": "Because of their complex folding and activation pathways, the metallocarboxypeptidases have been challenging enzymes to overproduce in heterologous systems. Even now, virtually every commercial preparation is obtained from natural sources. One group described the production of pre-pro-BoCPA in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a secreted zymogen and its subsequent activation by trypsin, but the yield of recombinant protein was not reported [134]. More recently, proBoCPA was produced as a thioredoxin fusion protein in E. coli, but the yield of purified fusion protein (prior to activation and purification of BoCPA) was only 0.8 mg per liter of bacterial culture and most of the fusion protein accumulated in the form of insoluble aggregates [135]. Efforts have also been made to overproduce mammalian carboxypeptidase A subtypes A1 and A2 in yeast [130], [136], [137], [138], but their narrower specificity makes these enzymes less appealing than BoCPA for the removal of C-terminal affinity tags from recombinant proteins. Moreover, none of the recombinant mammalian type A carboxypeptidases was engineered to include an affinity tag. Recently, a polyhistidine-tagged type A carboxypeptidase (MeCPA) from the fungal entomopathogen Metarhizium anisopliae has been secreted from baculovirus-infected insect cells and purified to homogeneity [117]. However, the yield of pure, active enzyme was a disappointing 0.25 mg per liter of conditioned medium. Yet this material proved to be highly active and, as predicted [139], the specificity of MeCPA was found to be even broader than that of BoCPA (Fig. 4\n). The same group has subsequently developed a strategy to produce MeCPA in E. coli that may be generally applicable to metallocarboxypeptidases. The proMeCPA zymogen is fused to the C-terminus of MBP to maintain it in a soluble form in the cytosol while the protein disulfide isomerase DsbC is co-expressed from a separate plasmid. This procedure yields about 1 mg of pure MeCPA per liter of bacterial culture (Austin et al., in preparation).",

However, endoproteases that exhibit little or no specificity for residues on the C-terminal side of the scissile bond (e.g., enteropeptidase and TEV protease) can be used to remove N-terminal affinity tags without leaving any extra residues on the N-terminus of the digestion product in most cases. Nevertheless, N-terminal exopeptidases are occasionally used for the removal of affinity tags.

            "text": "The TAGZyme system consists of three enzymatic reagents: dipeptidyl-aminopeptidase I (DAPase), glutamine cyclotransferase (Qcyclase), and pyroglutamylaminopeptidase (pGAPase). The principal enzyme is DAPase, which catalyzes the stepwise excision of dipeptides from the N-terminus of a polypeptide. Natural \u201croad blocks\u201d to DAPase digestion are a lysine or arginine in the first position of a dipeptide or a proline in either position. Consequently, DAPase cannot remove any N-terminal affinity tag. For instance, it could only remove a FLAG-tag (DYKDDDDK) if the tag were modified so that the proximal lysine residue did not occupy the first position of the second dipeptide, and it could not remove a polyarginine tag (RRRRR) or a Strep II tag (WSHPQFEK) under any circumstances. Instead, it is mainly used as a reagent for removing N-terminal polyhistidine tags, which need not contain any road-blocking residues. Incorporation of an arginine or lysine residue following the polyhistidine sequence will terminate DAPase digestion at that point, leaving behind the basic residue on the N-terminus of the digestion product. Alternatively, if a true \u201cnative\u201d N-terminus is desired, then this can be accomplished by inserting a glutamine residue immediately after the polyhistidine sequence and utilizing, in addition to DAPase, the other two enzymes, Qcyclase and pGAPase. When glutamine is exposed at the N-terminus of the polypeptide chain, it can be cyclized to pyroglutamate by the action of Qcyclase, rendering it resistant to further digestion by DAPase. The pyroglutamyl residue is then excised by pGAPase to yield a product with a native N-terminus.",

Additionally, care must be taken to remove the DAPase prior to the addition of pGAPase.

            "text": "Considering its high specificity yet relatively good tolerance for a wide variety of residues in the P1\u2032 position of its recognition site, coupled with its ease and economy of production and the ready availability of expression vectors from open sources (including affinity-tagged variants), TEV protease is probably the single best endoprotease for the removal of N-terminal affinity tags. The ideal reagent would have all of these attributes along with totally relaxed P1\u2032 specificity. Perhaps such an enzyme can be identified from among those encoded by other potyviruses or be engineered by rational design. As for the digestive carboxypeptidases, it would be useful to investigate whether a combination of A- and B-type enzymes can be used to remove a wider variety of short affinity tags from the C termini of recombinant proteins. Moreover, since the termini of proteins are often disordered, the ability to trim unstructured residues (apart from affinity tags) from their C termini might improve their propensity to crystallize. Yet it is unclear if the activity of these carboxypeptidases will be deterred upon encountering ordered structure in a globular protein. This needs to be tested. In principle, DAPase could be used in a similar fashion to remove disordered residues from the N-termini of proteins, subject to the same caveat. Proline is a roadblock for all of these exopeptidases and it would be useful to find a means of circumventing this issue. Finally, there are at least two ways in which endoproteases and exoproteases might be used in concert with each other that have yet to be explored. First, large C-terminal affinity tags (globular proteins) could be removed first by endoproteolytic cleavage at a designed site and then by treatment of the product with one or more carboxypeptidases to remove the remnants of the endoprotease recognition site from its C-terminus. The second potential application pertains to X-ray crystallography. It has been shown that the addition of trace amounts of relatively nonspecific endoproteases (e.g., chymotrypsin, subtilisin, thermolysin) to concentrated solutions of proteins prior to setting them up in crystallization trials sometimes enhances the growth of crystals [146], [147]. In some cases, the endoproteolytic cleavage events occur within disordered internal loops in the protein, in which case further trimming of the \u201cloose ends\u201d left by the endoproteases might be affected by exopeptidases.",
