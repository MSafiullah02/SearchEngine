So far, China has issued seven versions of COVID-19 clinical guidelines (Trial Version). According to the latest seventh edition, the treatments of COVID-19 still don\u2019t have specific medicine [5]. The treatment of COVID-19 involves multiple disciplines, and the current recommendations are mainly based on Western Medicine including supportive care, respiratory assisted ventilation, anti-infection (mainly antiviral agents), and glucocorticoid therapy [5]. Suggested antiviral agents are alpha-interferon (a-INF), lopinavir, ribavirin, chloroquine phosphate, and abidol. At present, there is no evidence to support the general or routine use of Western Medicine, nor is there any evidence to prove the risks and benefits of Western Medicine for COVID-19.",

Now, TCM has been practiced worldwide. During the SARS epidemic in 2003, TCM played a huge role [6], [7], [8]. COVID-19 belongs to the category of \u201cPestilence\u201d in TCM. Its main clinical manifestations are fever, fatigue, dry cough, and the disease is situated in the lung and related to the spleen, stomach, and heart. Like during the SARS period, TCM played a major role in the \u201cFight against the Pestilence in China\u201d, saving many people's lives [5], [9], [10]. There is now evidence that compared with the simple treatment of Western Medicine; Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine (Hereinafter referred to as \u201cIntegrated Medicine\u201d) for COVID-19 may have better effects [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. However, these studies have small sample sizes, and no convincing evidence is available to demonstrate the benefits and risks of Integrated Medicine for COVID-19.",

Second outcomes including the changes of laboratory indicators and the safety of Integrated Medicine of COVID-19, such as CRP, TNF-\u03b1, WBC count, Liver damage and Diarrhea. The Risk of Bias (RoB) assessment tool from the Cochrane Handbook was used to assess the methodological quality of RCTs [20], and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess the quality of CCSs [21]. Each RCT was assessed at low risk, high risk, or unclear risk relating to the following items: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other sources of bias. The NOS assesses the quality of CCSs with eight questions in three broad categories: (1) patient selection; (2) comparability of study groups; (3) assessment of the outcome. The total score is 9, the higher the score, the better the quality of the study. Two reviewers independently completed the data extraction and quality assessment.

Considering heterogeneity of drugs used in different trials, we calculated all results based on the random effect model. We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each pairwise comparison with I2 statistic, and value of < 25%, 25-50%, and > 50% considered as low, moderate, and high level of heterogeneity, respectively [22]. We would perform subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses to explore sources of heterogeneity if enough data were available.

In the included studies, eight different herbal medicine or Chinese patent medicine were used. This means that in terms of treatment, TCM can make more choices to make the best treatment. In addition, TCM was involved in the treatment of COVID-19 with different severity from Light to Critical [11], [24]. However, the use of these traditional herbs has been controversial due to unclear composition and lack of scientific evidence [32]. In our study, we found that the quality of these studies was low. In the treatment of many diseases, TCM is only used as adjuvant therapy [33], [34]. So, standard treatment and outcome index need to be developed. In this way, the best evidence can be systematically reviewed, summarized and disseminated to better provide evidence-based TCM decision-making.",
