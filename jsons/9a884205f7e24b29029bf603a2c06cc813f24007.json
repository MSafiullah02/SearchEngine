The value of chest radiography for assessing the severity of respiratory tract infections was firmly established during the 1918 influenza pandemic, in which the new radiologic capabilities were widely implemented to study patients and to correlate imaging with pathologic and clinical findings [9] . At the same time, it was recognized that the radiographic changes typical of severe influenza were also observed in other conditions, both infectious and noninfectious. The ability of chest radiographs to detect and discriminate disease processes was also restricted by overlapping projections of soft tissues. Although this problem was partly mitigated by the development of CT, which enabled major advances in image resolution, the sensitivity and specificity of radiographic imaging remain limited by the absence of unique features to distinguish infection from inflammation and by the lack of standardized scoring systems for disease severity [9, 10] .

By CT, these areas are termed ground-glass opacities (GGO) because of the hazy density of the lesions, in which the margins of bronchi and blood vessels are partially visible ( Figure 1B) . Autopsy findings suggest that GGO correspond to foci of viral pneumonitis and/or diffuse alveolar damage ( Figure 1E ).

An example of the latter is the herpesviral TK, which phosphorylates thymidine analogues that are not substrates for the host enzyme. Compounds, such as acyclovir and its analogues, can therefore be used both as antiviral drugs for the treatment of herpesviral infections and as radiolabeled tracers to detect sites of replication or recombinant TK expression [56] .
