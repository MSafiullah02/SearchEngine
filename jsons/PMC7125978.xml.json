            "text": "Ribavirin (1-\u03b2-d-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide) (1, Fig. 1\n) is a nucleoside analogue with antiviral activity against a number of DNA and RNA viruses in vitro and in vivo.1 Ribavirin has been approved for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus2 and forms part of the only approved combination therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCVa) infection.3 The agent is converted into its 5\u2032-monophosphate form (RMP) by intracellular phosphorylation mediated by adenosine kinase, followed by further phosphorylation to the di- and triphosphate (RDP and RTP).4 Its antiviral mode of action is not completely understood and, depending on the virus examined, several mechanisms have been proposed: (i) RMP inhibits the cellular enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), leading to reduced GTP pools,5, 6 which may play a synergistic role in promoting the incorporation of ribavirin into viral RNA;7 (ii) RTP inhibits viral RNA synthesis by inhibition of the viral polymerase,8 (iii) 5\u2032-capping of viral mRNAs is blocked by inhibition of the viral 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase (by RTP) or viral guanylyl transferase (by RMP),9 (iv) incorporation of ribavirin into this 5\u2032-cap impairs their function and (v) when incorporated into viral RNA, ribavirin induces an accumulation of mutations, which, if lethal, impede viral replication (so called \u2018error catastrophy\u2019).10 Finally, ribavirin has been attributed diverse immunomodulatory activities.11, 12 Whatever the precise mechanism, it is clear that phosphorylation of ribavirin to the mono- and perhaps triphosphate forms are crucial for its antiviral activity. In at least some human cell types, formation of the monophosphate by adenosine kinase was shown to be the rate-limiting step in the activation pathway.13\n",

The aim of this concept is to synthesize lipophilic prodrugs of the nucleoside monophosphate, which, after passive diffusion and enzymatic cleavage, release the free monophosphate at high intracellular concentrations. The structural motif of the prodrug consists of an aryl moiety and an amino acid ester to mask the negative charges of the nucleoside monophosphate. The ProTide approach has been successfully applied to several antiviral nucleosides such as didehydrodideoxythymidine (d4T),14, 15 (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (BVDU),16 abacavir,17 4\u2032-azidouridine,18 and acyclovir.19, 20\n",

Compound 13 was incubated with carboxypeptidase Y in acetone-d\n6 and Trizma buffer (pH 7.6) and the enzyme reaction was followed by 31P NMR. The spectra (Fig. 3\n) shows fast metabolism of the starting material (\u03b4\nP\n = 4) to the putative intermediate (18) (\u03b4\nP\n = 7), the reaction being completed within 1.5\u20132 h. The suggestion that the reaction product is structure (18) is based on two factors. Firstly, while (13) contains a chiral phosphorus and displays two phosphorus signals in the NMR, the (\u03b4\nP\n = 7) product elicits only one signal, suggestive of an achiral phosphorus, as in (18). Secondly, other reports of amino aryl phosphates such as (18) indicate a chemical shift of this magnitude.26 Close examination of the early (3\u201330 min) spectra shows a double peak at \u03b4\nP <5, indicative of a chiral phosphorus and consistent with the proposed activation pathway. This species is considered to be the initial cleavage product (16) on the basis of similar analogues.26 This enzyme experiment indicates that the first activation step of ProTide 13 is sufficiently efficient.",

The nature of this metabolite is currently unclear. It was also notable that, irrespective of the nature of the prodrug and the origin of the cell extract, in no case were significant levels of ribavirin-MP or polar ribavirin-MP metabolites, or ribavirin itself detected. It is currently unclear why no more polar metabolites are observed upon cell extract incubation, as noted above in the cathepsin assay and as is the case with other purine or pyrimidine nucleotide phosphoramidate ProTides studied in the past under identical experimental conditions. More investigations are required to clarify this issue. However, the lack of liberation of ribavirin monophosphate correlates with the somewhat poor antiviral activity noted here, and supports the modeling predictions on HINT. It may be that the unusual base present in ribavirin precludes the usually efficient monophosphate delivery by the ProTide motif.",

Our enzyme studies indicated that the first step in the activation of these ribavirin ProTides is efficient, but that subsequent amino acid cleavage to liberate the necessary free 5\u2032-monophosphate appear impeded in this case.
