Once activated in situ there, B cells begin to proliferate and form a germinal centre where longer-lasting, high-affinity responses are induced (2,3).",

This is achieved by a number of mechanisms such as antibody feedback (13) and follicle-resident CD8+ T cells (14,15). However, in this article we will focus on the contribution of Foxp3-expressing Treg cells to the control of the humoral response. Various phenotypes of T cells have immunosuppressive properties, but the best understood are CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg cells. These cells are critical to the regulation of humoral immunity as both mice and humans with loss of Foxp3 function have raised levels of serum antibodies (16,17). More recently, it has also become clear that Treg cells are able to travel into the B-cell follicle and directly regulate the germinal centre response (18\u201320).",

The function of Treg cells is controlled by two key features: (i) the expression of the transcription factor Foxp3 (23\u201325), responsible for the maintenance of several key phenotypic factors in Treg-cell function such as CTLA-4 expression and repression of IL-2 production and (ii) the maintenance of Treg-type epigenetics, a specific DNA hypomethylation pattern that is required for the stability and full functional capabilities of Treg cells (26). In cases where expression of Foxp3 is lost, such as in the scurfy mouse strain and immune dysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked syndrome (IPEX) patients, the resulting loss of Treg-cell function causes a range of severe immune disorders such as widespread autoimmunity, immunopathology and lymphoproliferation (17,24,27\u201329).",

In the K/BxN mouse model of autoantibody-driven arthritis, loss of Treg-cell function, owing to the introduction of the Foxp3 scurfy mutation, leads to accelerated production of pathogenic autoantibodies and accumulation of spleenic plasma cells (30,31). In humans, B cells from IPEX patients produce large amounts of autoreactive antibodies (32). Another characteristic feature of the loss of Foxp3 function is hyper-IgE in both mice (33) and IPEX patients (29). This may be partly because of the disproportionate effect of the loss of Treg-cell function on IL-4, critical for IgE production, in comparison with other cytokines (34).",

CD25-based depletion of Treg cells leads to increased autoantibody production in a murine model of arthritis (37) or in lupus-prone NZB/NZW F1 mice (38). Accordingly, transfer of ex-vivo-expanded Treg cells into NZB/NZW F1 mice ameliorates disease (39). The maintenance of peripheral anergy in autoreactive B cells is a critical tolerance mechanism, preventing activation of autoreactive B cells (8,40,41). In the absence of Treg cells, normally anergic, dsDNA-specific B cells lose their anergic phenotype and, following provision of T-cell help, produce anti-ds-DNA antibodies. Transfer of CD25+ Treg cells prevents this process (42). Correspondingly, specific Treg-cell depletion via diphtheria toxin also leads to a loss of B-cell anergy (43). Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related protein (GITR) is expressed at high levels on Treg cells and is important in their suppressor functions; depletion of GITR-expressing Treg cells also leads to the development of anti-myosin autoantibodies and myocarditis (44).",

However, Foxp3+ cells were more resistant to deletion, ensuring that the ratio of antigen-specific Foxp3+ cells to Foxp3\u2013 cells is higher for self-antigens (49).",

For foreign antigens, there are more Foxp3\u2013 than Foxp3+ Treg cells, whereas for self-antigens, there are more Foxp3+ than Foxp3\u2013 Treg cells.

Pioneering work from Lim and colleagues demonstrated that, upon activation, CD4+CD25+CD69\u2013 Treg cells are able to downregulate CCR7 while simultaneously upregulating CXCR5, allowing them to migrate into the B-cell zone (78). As a result, these Tfreg cells could be visualized in the germinal centres of human tonsillar sections (78,79). The Tfreg cells are able to suppress T-cell-dependent antibody production as well as directly inhibit antibody production by CD40-stimulated B cells in the absence of Th cells (78,79).",

Tfreg cells appear to differentiate from natural Treg cells (which already have their regulatory phenotype in the thymus), rather than being a form of induced Treg cells (which develop their regulatory phenotype only in the periphery), and require many of the same signals as Tfh cells as their formation is dependent on CD28, and SAP (signalling lymphocytic activation molecule-associated protein) signalling and interactions with B cells (18\u201320).",

This contrasts with the observation that although total numbers of germinal centre B cells increased, there was an overall drop in the number of antigen-specific B cells and the resulting serum antibody levels (19).

However, beyond a certain threshold, homeostasis is disrupted and the overwhelming numbers of antigen-non-specific or autoantigen-specific cells expanding in the absence of Treg cells may prove deleterious to an antigen-specific response (Fig. 1). Indeed we have found that while short-term depletion of Treg cells around the time of vaccination leads to enhanced numbers of tetramer-binding Tfh cells and antigen-specific germinal centre B cells, prolonged Treg-cell depletion leads to high levels of Tfh cells and germinal centre expansion but a reduction in the total number of tetramer-binding Tfh cells, with the percentage of antigen-recognizing B cells dropping in correlation with germinal centre expansion (J.

In addition to its role in the control of CD80 and CD86 expression, CTLA-4 may also directly inhibit the function of CD80/CD86-expressing DCs by inducing nuclear translocation of the transcription factor Foxo3, leading to a loss of IL-6 expression (93) or modulating tryptophan catabolism by induction of the immunoregulatory enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) (94).",

This increase in autoimmunity and autoantibody production may be because of the observed expansion of Tfh cells in either PD-1-deficient mice or following PD-1 blocking (101,102). However, it seems that this dysregulation also results in a loss of quality as the generated Tfh cells may have reduced IL-4 and IL-21 expression leading to reductions in the numbers of long-lasting plasma cells (103) and the production of large amounts of low-affinity IgA in the Peyer\u2019s patches that fail to properly control the gut microbiota (104).",

Furthermore, following stimulation with IL-10, germinal centre B cells upregulate Bcl-2 expression, preventing their apoptosis (111), although this does not appear to be the mechanism of enhanced antibody production from B-cells isolated from lupus patients (110).

Interestingly, IL-10R KO mice also have quantitative increases in CXCR5+ T-cell formation following vaccination in addition to qualitative increases in IL-21 and IL-17 expression by said cells (117). However, since Treg cells themselves appear to require IL-10 signalling to maintain their full function and control of IL-17-producing cells, the possibility of reduced IL-10 signalling inhibiting Treg-cell function must be also be considered (118). Also, purified DCs from IL-10R KO mice had enhanced IL-6 and IL-23 expression following in vitro stimulation, again demonstrating a cell-intrinsic role in suppressing DC function (117).",
