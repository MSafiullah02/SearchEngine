            "text": "Autopsies are surgical procedures performed in the field of pathology that are used to find a deceased person's cause or manner of death. Different diagnoses ask for different examinations, some of which requiring incisions in superficial tissues to provide access to deeper internal tissues of the body. Since forensic practitioners are generally aware of potential hazards, protective clothing is used and protocols are followed to minimise contact with pathogens [1], [2]. Some contamination routes may seem more obvious than others due to explicit interaction with contaminants, such as through cuts by scalpels or punctures with needles. However, inhalation of infectious airborne particles during an autopsy could be as harmful as an accidental cut [2], [3], [4]. Powered surgical instruments, such as saws and drills, are greatly responsible for aerosolisation (solid or liquid airborne particles) of body tissues, exposure to these aerosols may be considered an often overlooked contamination route [5], [6].",

            "text": "Oscillating saws are routinely used during autopsies, when forensic practitioners are required to make deep incisions through bone or cartilage tissues, oscillating saws have an advantage due to an increased ease of use and accessibility compared to hand or band saws. There is however a concern about the production of suspended particles (aerosols) when operating the saw. Aerosols produced by sawing can be dispersed wide in the surroundings of the site of operation, possibly reaching the respiratory tract of the operator [5], [7], [8], [9]. The aerosol's particle size determines the potential invasion depth of the aerosol in the inhaler's respiratory tract, as reported in [3], and can possibly act as a pathway for hazardous diseases [10]. For example, for particles of 0.1 \u03bcm about 2.1% will only reach the head airways, 2.7% will reach the tracheobronchial region and 14% will end up in the alveoli. For particles of 10 \u03bcm this would be 81%, 1.5% and 1.9%, respectively. Particles smaller than 10 \u03bcm are within the respirable range [3] and have the potential to remain suspended in the air for long periods of time, increasing the time during which the air around the working area is contaminated with possibly infective aerosol [9]. Among the hazardous pathogens are Hepatitis B and C, Streptococci, and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), of which transmissions have already been recorded during autopsy sessions [11], [12], [13], [14]. When inhaling such pathogens, a minimal infective dose (MID) is required to actually produce an infection. Most respiratory viruses appear to have infectious potential in humans even with low doses [15]. Concern also emerges towards unknown MIDs, as this serves as motivation for prophylaxis, see Table 1\n.",

Analysing the effect of frequency on particle production, it was demonstrated that higher frequencies result in a higher number of aerosol particles produced for the smaller particle sizes, except for particles of size 10.0 \u03bcm. The deviating results for 10.0 \u03bcm aerosol particles could be explained as these bigger particles are more susceptible to disturbances, such as air resistance.

There was however a limit to those parameters, as it was necessary to observe the saw's torque threshold: frequencies lower than 150 Hz or contact loads higher than 5 kg could lead to engine halts or failure to cut through the bone. Similarly, the cutting time was affected by the used saw blade contact loads and saw blade frequency, which together with a possible change in quality of cut could be a reason why forensic practitioners use these sawing parameters.",

Considering that in resting conditions humans breathe about 6 l of air per minute [18], this would result in the inhalation of 3.43 \u00d7 106 particles. Together with [3] observations on deposition of aerosol in the human respiratory track, different amounts of particles will be deposited in different parts of the respiratory tract, all potentially providing health risks. Depending on a pathogen's survivability and the time period during which a person is in contact with the bone dust, it is plausible to assume that a pathogen could cause an infection on its host, as seen by [15] and [7] in studies on Minimal Infection Dose.",

Similarly, workers in environments without means to acquire ventilation systems, or where the reduction the spreading of dust is hard to achieve, e.g. in field work, emergency response work, or practices in less developed or poorer countries, could improve their bone sawing protocols with the results of the current study. Future studies should investigate realistic scenarios faced by forensic practitioners, such as aerosolisation of fresh bone instead of dry archaeological bone. Furthermore, testing different bone types (e.g. long, short, flat, irregular or sesamoid bones), and testing additional sawing parameters (such as the morphology of the saw blade), and their effects on aerosol production could be investigated. Lastly, following the steps of [17], future studies should study influences of ventilation systems and air flows in autopsy rooms.",
