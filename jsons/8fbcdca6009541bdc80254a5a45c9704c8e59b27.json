Compared to these two studies, our study has several advantages that make it more conclusive. First, the present meta-analysis included 34 studies involving a total of 8,080 COVID-19 patients compared to no more than 3,561 patients in previous meta-analyses. Thus, our study had enlarged sample sizes and added statistical power of nearly 4500 cases. Second, studies included in previous meta-analyses were all from China, so the results may not apply to other countries and data selection bias may exist. However, our meta-analysis included studies from four countries, although only three studies from Italy, France, and Korea.

The development of cancer is usually related to a blunted immune status [53, 54] , and anti-cancer treatments (such as chemotherapy and surgery) can also put cancer patients in an immunosuppressive state [8] . Therefore, immunodeficiency may be the main reason for cancer patients susceptible to COVID-19. Our subgroup analyses found that the prevalence of cancer among COVID-19 patients in Italy, France, and Korea were higher than that in China, although the result was limited by the sample size.
