Although early infectivity studies showed that RNA3 encodes coat protein (CP), trypsin degradation analysis showed that the principal translation product of RNA3 was unrelated to CP, while RNA4 served as an excellent template for CP. Moreover, when mixtures of all BMV RNAs were added to wheat germ extracts in increasing amounts, RNA4 inhibited translation of genomic RNAs 1\u20133. These results showed that RNA4 is a subgenomic CP mRNA derived from RNA3, and implied an elegant system of gene regulation by translational competition: early in infection when viral RNA concentrations are low, all viral proteins including nonstructural RNA replication factors are translated, while after the virion RNAs are sufficiently amplified, CP is preferentially translated to encapsidate these RNAs.",

RNA sequencing (a challenging, chromatography-based process at the time) revealed that the two fragments were 5\u2032-terminal, overlapping, and encoded the first 4 and 14 amino acids of CP, respectively. The most distinguishing feature was that the initiating AUG codon for CP began only 10 nucleotides (nt) from the m7G5\u2032ppp5\u2032Gp-capped RNA4 5\u2032-end, presaging the now well-known mechanistic linkage between most eukaryotic translation initiation and 5\u2032-mRNA caps.",

These similarities initially were recognized between BMV, alfalfa mosaic virus, tobacco mosaic virus, and Sindbis virus, and subsequently were found to extend to many other viruses now grouped together as the alphavirus-like superfamily.

Using a transcribable BMV RNA3 cDNA clone, the CP open reading frame (ORF) was replaced with the ORF of the bacterial reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). When in vitro transcribed and inoculated onto barley protoplasts with RNA1 and RNA2 transcripts, this RNA3 derivative was replicated and produced CAT activity at higher levels than previously achieved by DNA-based transformation. This first demonstration that RNA viruses can be engineered at the cDNA level showed that the viral RNA genome functions in a sufficiently flexible and modular fashion to tolerate even large changes such as whole gene replacements without substantial optimization, which has significant implications for virus evolution, basic research and biotechnology applications such as development of additional gene expression vectors.",

In 1979, Hall and colleagues developed a virus-specific in vitro RdRp extract from BMV-infected barley leaves that synthesized full-length negative-strand RNAs using added BMV virion RNAs as templates. This was the first eukaryotic in vitro RdRp preparation exhibiting a high level of template specificity, with other viral RNAs having less than 20% of the template activity of BMV RNAs.

BMV RNA 3\u2032-ends were also found to interact with (ATP, CTP):tRNA nucleotidyl transferase, which can add 3\u2032-CCAOH ends to mature or maintain incomplete BMV RNAs, thus acting as a primitive telomerase.

Subsequent studies showed that this region is required for a step prior to negative-strand RNA synthesis, and is necessary and sufficient for 1a to recognize and recruit an RNA to a membrane-associated, translationally inaccessible, nuclease-resistant state that appears to be the spherule interior. Structure probing studies show that this intergenic RNA3 sequence folds into a long, bulged stem loop, which presents at its apex the invariant sequence and structure of tRNA T\u03a8C stem loops. In plant and yeast cells, the appropriate BMV residues in this consensus are modified to T and \u03a8, showing that, like the 3\u2032-end, this sequence interacts in vivo with tRNA-specific enzymes.

Kao and associates further found that DNA or DNA/RNA hybrid templates containing the key BMV promoter sequences can be recognized in vitro by BMV RdRp extracts and copied into RNA.

Biochemical and genetic results support these ideas and have begun to elucidate some of the relevant host factors and contributions.

Subsequent work by the Bujarski group and others demonstrated many forms and features of inter- and intramolecular, homologous, and nonhomologous RNA recombination in BMV. Among other findings, Bujarski and collaborators showed that mutations in BMV RNA replication factors 1a and 2apol could alter the frequencies and distributions of crossover sites, implying that at least a significant portion of such recombination was a byproduct of RNA replication, as by template switching. These and other results show that RNA recombination is a major force for repairing BMV genomes damaged by the high mutation rates of viral RNA replication and other events, thereby contributing to BMV survival and adaptability.",

Cryoelectron microscope reconstructions by Baker and collaborators and subsequently X-ray crystallography by McPherson and co-workers showed that the BMV capsid structure is extremely similar to that of the related bromovirus, cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV), whose capsid structure was solved by Johnson and colleagues in 1995. Intriguingly, some features of these capsids are dissimilar from other known isometric RNA virus capsids, but similar to capsids of the DNA-containing papovaviruses. These features include orientation of the core \u03b2-barrel nearly perpendicular to the capsid surface to form distinctively prominent hexameric and pentameric capsomeres, and linking of adjacent capsomere clusters by exchange of invading C-terminal arms. These shared features suggest that BMV CP and the CPs of polyoma- and papillomaviruses likely share a common ancestor. BMV virion RNA is arranged as an interior subshell inside the capsid, leaving a hollow virion center. The N-terminal 26 amino acids of the CP, which are highly basic and required for RNA packaging, interact with the RNA to neutralize its charge.",

This assembly polymorphism is controlled in vivo by the RNA packaged, with BMV RNA2 packaged in 180-subunit capsids, while a small chimeric mRNA containing the CP ORF as its only BMV sequence is packaged in 120-subunit capsids. Structural features shared by 120- and 180-subunit capsids imply that a common pentamer of CP dimers is an important intermediate in BMV virion assembly.",

Host adaptation of 3a generally exerts the predominant effects on infection spread, and only a few amino acid changes in 3a are required to extend BMV host range from monocotyledonous to dicotyledonous plants. However, changes modulating the efficiency of systemic spread also map to 1a and 2apol. Such changes may alter systemic spread through host-specific effects on RNA replication, as by influencing the ability of the virus to replicate and spread faster than host defense responses. Alternatively, 1a and 2apol may possess additional functions, as for some C-terminal 2apol sequences that are dispensable for RNA replication but required for efficient systemic infection.",
