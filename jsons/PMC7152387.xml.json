Initial research efforts have focused on establishing an epidemiologic link between bats and humans.3, 4, 6, 17 There is no conclusive evidence to support the theory that bats are the source of human infection, although there is consensus that bats are the ancestral hosts of the disease.4, 5, 17 A related MERS-like CoV virus, isolated from an African pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus hesperidus) in Uganda, has shown high divergence of the S protein nucleotide sequence compared with an index MERS-CoV S protein sequence (46% amino acid identity divergence).17 This suggests that the two viruses differ significantly in receptor binding properties, implying that the MERS-like CoV virus is not a zoonotic threat and supporting the theory of a common ancestry.17\n",

Supportive treatment is indicated for hospitalized patients, but vigilance for complications is essential.8 Empirical use of antimicrobial agents or steroids has not succeeded in reversing the progression of severe disease.8, 27, 29 No specific drug or vaccine is currently available to treat MERS. Indeed, it has been stated that the complexity and time required for the development and registration process of drugs for human use impedes the ability to counter the rapid threat against an emerging infectious agent.8 For example, there is no vaccine available against SARS-CoV because of the brevity of the threat to the public health.2, 8 It is likely that a MERS-CoV vaccine for human use may not be developed due to a lack of commercial interest, or if the threat posed by MERS-CoV declines in the meantime.8\n",
