Advances in biotechnology, underpinned by a massive leap in computational resources, have provided a wealth of biological data at all levels of biological organisation. At the molecular and cellular levels the various genome and proteome projects (States et al., 2006; International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2005; Snow et al., 2005), coupled with advances and innovations in microscopy and biological imaging, have provided descriptions of unprecedented detail of the constituent parts and basic structures of living organisms. The bulk of these data to date, particularly at the molecular level, has been obtained from in vitro, and usually static, laboratory experiments. Although increasingly dynamic changes are also being considered, experimental complexity usually restricts observations to single, or very restricted, spatial and/or temporal scales. However, the primary purpose of this massive experimental and data collection programme is to determine how biological and physiological function arises within living organisms, so that increasingly interest is turning towards \u2018integrative\u2019 or \u2018systems\u2019 approaches to the problem of function determination (Kitano, 2002).",

In general, these dynamic interactions cannot be recreated purely by experimental observation, and the only feasible approach is to develop mathematical and computational models which couple together the underlying complex interacting non-linear processes.",

Hunter and Borg (2003) demonstrate that the spatial scales that may need to be considered in a complete model of the human body range from 1 nm (protein) to 1 m (whole body)\u201410 orders of magnitude\u2014and the temporal scales from 1 \u03bcs (ion channel gating) to 109\n s (human lifetime)\u201416 orders of magnitude. Such a wide range of scales requires a coupled hierarchy of models, each describing behaviour at a different scale, to encapsulate the complete system. In general, these resulting mathematical models are sufficiently complex that they can only be solved numerically, resulting in the increasing importance of computational simulation methods.",

We begin by giving what we hope is a helpful classification of multi-scale modelling in biology based on levels of biological organisation rather than absolute length or time scales. We then go on to discuss what we see as the key modelling, numerical, and computational issues that arise in such multi-scale approaches, before reviewing two of the areas in which these techniques have reached a high level of maturity: molecular dynamics (MD) and whole heart modelling. We conclude by discussing the progress made in these two fields towards addressing the difficulties inherent in the numerical solution of a multi-scale computational model and outline the type of problems we expect to see in the future as we try to model increasingly complex problems.",

The most accurate representation of the interactions of electrons is obtained by solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (known as an ab initio calculation). However, the complex nature of the interactions means that it is currently not feasible to solve the time-dependant Schr\u00f6dinger equation (for any system containing more than one atom), and the time-independent equation can only be solved for systems with fewer than 15 electrons (Miller and Clary, 2004; Th\u00f8gersen and Olsen, 2004). For this reason, quantum mechanical (QM) simulations usually exploit some simplified model of the interactions between electrons (for a discussion, see Jensen, 2006). Using commercially available QM packages, the structure of relatively large molecules can be investigated. For example, using Q-Chem the structure of a hexadecapeptide (80 heavy atoms) can be calculated in between 10 and 100 h (depending on the model chosen) on a single 2 MHz Opteron processor (Shao et al., 2006).",

            "text": "Next, at the molecular level, the system is defined in terms of the (classical) interactions between atoms (and ions). The system is governed by Newton's laws and the differences between the models are in the method used to calculate the forces, which are due to the deformation of chemical bonds, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic, dipole\u2013dipole and van der Waals interactions. Many different force fields have been suggested: most represent a trade-off between accuracy (exact expressions are known for many of the forces) and numerical tractability (see, for example, Schlick (2002) for an overview of commonly used force fields). In contrast to the quantum level, simulations of relatively large dynamic systems are possible at the molecular level: the modelling of these systems is known as MD whereas structural determination using inter-atomic force fields is referred to as molecular mechanics (MM). Commercial MM packages can be used to estimate the structure of very large molecules. (Although the problems are computationally tractable, the accuracy of the predictions is dependent on the accuracy of the force field used.) In MD simulations, computational tractability is an issue even for relatively small systems: simulations of pure lipids can deal with length scales of the order of 10\u201330 nm and time scales of \u2018hundreds of nanoseconds\u2019 (Tieleman, 2006). However, for the simulation of a more complex system\u2014a patch of lipid bilayer containing a single ion channel and surrounded by water and ions (with tens of thousands of particles)\u2014Tieleman (2006) records that the simulation of just 1 ns of activity requires between 1 and 2 days.",

However, it is possible to reduce the number of degrees of freedom in the system by treating groups of particles as single entities, allowing simulations to be run for longer, but with a reduction in the accuracy of the results. As at the molecular level, Newton's laws govern the behaviour of the system and the modelling process amounts to the determination of an appropriate force field to describe the interaction between particles. Tieleman et al. (2001) describe how \u2018coarse-graining\u2019 can be used in the simulation of a large number of ions passing through a channel in order to calculate a macroscopic current. (The tens of nanoseconds that could be achieved with a MD simulation would not be sufficient to determine such a current.) We describe this level, where functional units consisting of several molecules are our base unit, as the macro-molecular level. This is the last level at which stochastic methods are routinely used: at higher levels of functionality the interactions between particles are averaged and deterministic models result.",

This in turn allows the flux of various substances to be modelled by processes such as diffusion or convection, which can be modelled using partial differential equations (PDEs) and spatially varying density functions rather than having to keep track of individual particles (or groups of particles). The natural upper bound to this single continuum level is the whole cell, where the cell membrane and the structural alignment between cells break up the continuum. Hence, we will refer to this as the sub-cellular level, in line with our convention of naming different length scales after their biological functionality. Note that in the physical sciences it is often referred to as the mesoscopic scale (since it lies between the microscopic and macroscopic scales). A wide variety of sub-cellular processes have been modelled. These are too numerous to give an exhaustive list, but include processes such as actin\u2013myosin dynamics (Negroni and Lascano, 1996; Campbell et al., 2001). However, the location of the sub-cellular level on the interface between stochastic and deterministic events makes it difficult to include in a multi-scale model since it can be difficult to couple models across this interface. (Nevertheless, the sub-cellular level can be considered the \u2018top\u2019 level in multi-scale models of ion channels, since the current through the channel is a sub-cellular process.)",

The typical size of a cell (\u223c10\u20135\n m, although there is a great deal of variety between different types of cell) also puts them at the interface between the mostly biochemical processes discussed above and the resulting macroscopic physiological properties. This property makes the cellular level a natural starting point for many integrative physiological models: cells are small enough to encapsulate many microscopic processes, yet large enough that they influence macroscopic behaviour. Cells are also self-contained and isolated from their surroundings by a selectively permeable membrane (and in the case of prokaryotic cells also by a rigid cell wall). So, many of the interactions of a cell with other cells and the extra-cellular space can be summarised by recording the flux of various substances (ions, nutrients) across the cell membrane\u2014suggesting that the formulation of conservation laws in the form of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe them provides a natural way of modelling their behaviour. Many cell models have been proposed over the years. Many of these (over 350, from a variety of fields at the time of writing) are accessible online via the CellML repository (http://www.cellml.org, and see Lloyd et al., 2004). Noble and Rudy (2001) and Rudy and Silva (2006) have described the development of cardiac cell models, which are by far the most advanced cell models. Using current desktop computer technology, even the most advanced cell models can be simulated faster than real time using purpose built software packages such as COR (Garny et al., 2003).",

In addition to the cells, a region of tissue will typically also contain an extra-cellular matrix (ECM) that holds the cells together and gives them some structural stability. Since the cell models discussed in the previous section do not include the ECM, mechanical models are usually formulated at the tissue level. Properties that result from the interactions between cells (such as the propagation of a cardiac action potential or the development of a cancerous tumour) must also be modelled at this level. Since these processes depend on position within the tissue, the models usually consist of PDEs (or sometimes cellular automata) rather than the ODEs generally seen at the cellular level. Keener and Sneyd (1998) give an overview of a wide variety of tissue level models to describe many different physiological processes. A survey of mechanical models of various types of tissue can be found in Fung (1993), while Humphrey (2003) provides a more recent review of the mechanics of soft tissue. An overview of cancer modelling is given in Preziosi (2003). The amount of time required to run simulations of tissue level models can vary greatly. Generally, they can be solved relatively quickly if there is no interaction with models at the cell level\u2014for example, the solution of a model containing a small number of coupled (and possibly nonlinear) PDEs on a finite element (FE) mesh containing many thousands of nodes (or on a finite difference (FD) grid with a similar number of degrees of freedom) may take minutes to hours on a single processor. If, however, cellular models are to be embedded in the tissue model then the time taken to simulate the model can increase dramatically\u2014particularly if the cellular models show behaviour on multiple time scales necessitating small time steps.",

Usually the organ consists of a single main tissue type (e.g. myocardium in the heart) and several sporadic types (nervous, connective, blood). At the organ level, modelling usually consists of integrating tissue level models with one another and with a representation of the geometry of the organ that is being modelled. For example, a FE mesh might be constructed based on the shape of a real heart and encoding information about the fibre orientation at each mesh point (Vetter and McCulloch, 1998). Various organ level heart models have been proposed and are discussed in more detail in Section 5 (see also the review by Kerckhoffs et al. (2006)). However, it will be seen that these models are generally not of the whole heart but of single ventricles, atria or other subunits of the heart. Models of other organs are generally less mature than those of the heart, with most existing work concentrating on developing individual tissue level models rather than attempting to link them together. Recall that tissue level models can be computationally demanding. Since organ level models generally have tissue models embedded within them they require even longer to simulate. In fact, as will be seen in Section 5, accurate ventricular models often require several days to simulate even a few hundred milliseconds on very powerful computers.",

Examples include the nervous system, circulatory system, respiratory system and immune system. It follows that two or more of the organ models described in the previous section could be coupled to provide a model of an organ system. An initial candidate, building on current work on organ level models of the heart, could be the cardiovascular system. Modelling at the organ level is not yet mature enough for significant work to begin at the organ system level. However, Hunter et al. (2002) describe how ontological information such as publications, images, movies, models and anatomical notes have been collated from disparate databases to form a central resource. They also show how the bones, muscles and tendons around the knee can be built into an integrated model of the leg with mechanical stresses from the highest spatial level feeding back to the cell level where the balance of osteoblasts and osteoclasts in the bone is maintained. In a review by Crampin et al. (2004) there is a detailed description of how the cardiac and lung models are built from the cell level upwards. The geometric modelling of branching airways and alveoli bears substantial similarity with that of the pulmonary network of capillaries in the lungs. This is in turn similar to the blood supply in the heart. One can see that some of the problems tackled in modelling individual organs are duplicated in other organs. However, the task of combining organs into a single organ system is not as simple as running several models in tandem since there are feedback mechanisms (such as blood pressure and oxygenation) which cross between the systems. The development of sophisticated models of organ systems will require new models to be developed to describe these interfaces between the various organs that make up the system.",

According to the UK computer science community, the computational modelling of a simple biological organism such as the nematode worm is seen as a major computational challenge for part of this century (Harel, 2004, Harel, 2005). With that in mind, modelling an organism such as a human must be viewed as ambitious\u2014and consequently there is little existing work to discuss here. However, it would be a natural progression from the development of whole organ and organ system models to the construction of a \u2018virtual physiological human\u2019 (VPH): an integrated computer model to predict the response of a real organism to different physiological and pathological conditions. Hunter and Borg (2003) show that much of the work in constructing such a VPH relies on working from the bottom level upwards (from the gene via proteins and cells to the total organism). There are notable places in the modelling framework where information flows back down through the biological levels, such as signal pathways which couple events at the tissue level back to gene expression at a sub-cellular level.",

Each of these components of the environment may impact on the organism level model and, hence, may also need to be modelled. Further, the organism may play an active part in shaping its environment, leading to a two-way feedback mechanism. Most of the work in modelling biological systems within an environment has concentrated either on population growth between species which are competing for resources or on epidemiology\u2014the spread of disease through a population of individuals. Interactions between individuals are modelled at a coarse scale using empirical data to provide the probability of certain events occurring. A typical compartmental epidemic model for the spread of a virus is the \u2018SIR\u2019 model, in which the interactions of three distinct populations of individuals (unexposed and therefore susceptible to the virus, infectious, or recovered from the virus) are modelled. A stochastic compartmental model was successfully used by Riley et al. (2003) to fit known clinical data from a recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The model is then used to predict the future spread of the disease under certain constraints such as travel restrictions. This type of analysis is common in epidemiology, and gives a good indication of the use of treatments and quarantine. However, its limitation is that the epidemic spread parameters are normally measured empirically. There is no coupling between the biological level of the virus and that of population mixing.",

So, in an integrative model of tumourigenesis (the formation of a cancer, thought to be due to a genetic mutation) a more appropriate initial choice of levels might be: genetic, proteomic (gene expression), sub-cellular and cellular, although to model the growth and spread of a tumour accurately a number of tissue and organ level effects would also need to be included. Similarly, in some applications it may be more natural to merge two of the levels discussed here or to split one or more of them into distinct sub-levels.

In the context of biology and physiology, we have defined various length scales in terms of levels of biological organisation. Here we suggest a definition of multi-scale as being a model which includes components from two or more of these levels of organisation (multiple length scales) or if it includes some processes that occur much faster in time than others (multiple time scales). Examples of multi-scale physiological models are the bidomain and monodomain models of cardiac electrophysiology (see, for example, Keener and Sneyd,1998). These models describe tissue (or organ) level propagation of an electrical wave front. However, the wave front is caused by the existence of cell membranes containing conducting ion channels\u2014a cellular level process. The chemical reactions that regulate the ion channels occur on multiple time scales. A further example of a multi-scale physiological model may be taken from respiratory physiology. The transport of gas into the lungs from the atmosphere is modelled at the level of the organ (Tawhai et al., 2000; Scherer et al., 1988; Whiteley et al., 2002) as is the transport of blood through the lungs (Burrowes et al., 2004). These two processes are coupled by the transport of gas across the alveolar membrane, another organ level process. However, this diffusion is driven by reactions that take place within individual red blood cells and occur on a wide range of time scales and length scales (Whiteley, 2006b).",

In turn, the mechanical contraction affects the electrical activity of the heart. Furthermore, both the mechanical deformation and the fluid flow in the chambers of the heart are clearly closely coupled. A general model of the heart should include the three physical processes of electrical generation and propagation, soft tissue deformation, and fluid flow. A second example of a multi-physics problem is avascular tumour growth. There is extensive literature devoted to modelling tumour growth (see Fasano et al. (2006) for a recent review). The growth of a tumour displaces surrounding tissue. This displacement is usually modelled by nonlinear elasticity. This deformation results in the surrounding tissue exerting a force on the tumour, which affects the growth of the tumour (Chen et al., 2001).

Burrage et al. (2004) have reviewed some of the possible methods for incorporating stochastic processes in a deterministic framework (in particular the formulation of stochastic differential equations) in the context of chemical reactions that occur on multiple time scales. However, to our knowledge, this has not been applied to any large-scale problem in the life sciences. For this reason we will mostly consider the computational modelling of stochastic processes and that of deterministic processes separately. In this section, we will outline some other difficulties in formulating and solving a multi-scale (or multi-physics) computational model for which more progress towards solutions has been made. For the moment we restrict ourselves to broad principles. More concrete examples (and extensive references) can be found in the case studies that follow in 4, 5.",

In general, the time scales on which the lower-level processes occur are much faster than those on which the higher-level processes occur. Usually this means that the lower-level processes can be assumed to occur instantaneously and can be included in a representation of the force field at the higher level. Storing the positions of each of the particles can cause problems in memory allocation and calculating the force resulting from each interaction can also lead to a very large number of calculations needing to be performed. In general, these factors mean that large stochastic models are usually computationally intensive. The switch to a model at a higher level of organisation is usually determined by the need to ensure that the calculations can be performed in a reasonable period of time (perhaps days rather than weeks or months in this context). Work on coupling stochastic models from different levels together (e.g. QM/MM coupling) is beginning to be done and examples of this are considered in Section 4.",

The system of governing equations is now a large system modelling multi-scale processes. Equations representing multi-scale processes are stiff. As a rule of thumb it is usually much more efficient to use implicit numerical methods to solve stiff problems. There are several drawbacks with implementing implicit methods for the large non-linear systems that typically arise from physiological systems: we need to be able to write down the Jacobian matrix, which is usually non-trivial; sufficient memory is required to store the matrix; and it can be very expensive to compute its entries. However, explicit methods are vulnerable to numerical instability. So neither is ideal\u2014the alternative is to use semi-implicit methods where the large problem is broken down into a system of smaller sub-problems and in each sub-problem some variables are solved implicitly and some explicitly. Choosing the decomposition in a suitable manner allows the benefits of both implicit and explicit methods.

In doing this we show how these fields have addressed the issues we described above. Between them, MD and heart modelling span most of the different scales discussed in Section 2\u2014from quantum to organ level. They are also implicitly linked to one another, as it will be seen that the cellular level models used in heart modelling encapsulate the bulk behaviour of ion channels. The interface between the two fields is (approximately) at the level at which the interface between deterministic (heart) and stochastic (MD) is found. That each is considered separately emphasises the difficulty in modelling across this divide. The two fields also provide a contrast in the way multi-scale modelling has progressed. Many of the (relatively recent) heart models have been developed with an integrated organ model in mind. In ion channel modelling, on the other hand, the models have generally been developed separately and only now are links between the different levels being introduced.",

This degree of selectivity is conferred by a sequence of five highly conserved residues precisely placed in the neck of the channel. The TXGYG motif is common to all potassium channels and in the tetrameric arrangement of most potassium channels forms the selectivity filter. The filter comprises a set of oxygen rings along the passage, of precisely the correct dimension for binding dehydrated K+ ions. K+ ions in solution have a hydration shell, and when they pass into the selectivity filter they dehydrate and bind to the carbonyl oxygen atoms in the filter. The binding directly balances the energetic cost of the dehydration. The precise positioning of the carbonyl groups means that the energetic gain from binding a K+ ion balances the dehydration cost, but is not enough to balance the cost of dehydrating a Na+ ion (Hille, 2001).",

This motion may cause conformational changes in the protein that affect conductance. Ligand sensitive channels have receptor sites that bind chemical messengers or transmitters. The binding of the messenger to the receptor alters the channel's state from either open or closed. Ligand sensitive channels are sometimes referred to as ionotropic receptors. They are usually specific to the ionic species they are permeable to, and binding of the transmitter usually opens the channel. In a few cases, the binding decreases channel conductance by causing a closing of the channel. The binding causes a conformational change in the protein which brings about the change in conductance. When the bound ligand dissociates, the channel reverts to its resting state. Channels can also be gated by stretching (mechanosensitive channels) and by a ligand sensitive mechanism where the receptor is not directly coupled to the channel (second messenger gating).",

This enabled potential profiles to be computed for single potassium ions passing through the channel. MD simulations of potassium ions in the pore were performed to obtain velocity autocorrelation functions, from which the fluid dynamic diffusion coefficient was derived. This coefficient was in good agreement with the bulk diffusion coefficient of potassium ions in water. Having obtained the ionic mobility, Brownian dynamics simulations were then performed in one dimension to determine the ionic fluxes. One-dimensional Brownian dynamics is an effective constraint on the ion to only move in the axial direction of the channel. From the ionic flux measurements, current\u2013voltage curves and average channel conductance were both shown to agree reasonably well with experiment. The mean number of ions in the channel at various transmembrane potentials was compared with the computed Using flux-ratio exponent and they were found to be in good agreement.",

Intra-cellular mechanisms, in particular the regulation of the Ca2+ concentration by the sarcolemma, can also be included (Luo and Rudy, 1994a, Luo and Rudy, 1994b; Faber and Rudy, 2000; Winslow et al., 2000).

Stretch-activated ion channels have also been included in ionic models (Kohl et al., 1999; Healy and McCulloch, 2005), allowing for two-way feedback between the electrophysiological and mechanical models of the heart. Although there are a large number of (nonlinear) ODEs in the models, their individual solutions can be computed extremely quickly. However, problems may arise when a large number of cellular components are embedded in a tissue or organ level model\u2014the cumulative expense of solving many thousands of complex cell models may be high. For this reason, many simulators still use the early models with few ionic currents. Further, Fenton and Karma (1998) have attempted to work back from the more complex models to determine the model with minimal ionic complexity that accurately reproduces the cardiac action potential. The resulting model contains three channel currents (the same number as in some of the earliest cell models). The discussion of cell models in this section should not be considered to be at all exhaustive. There are many more models available than those mentioned here. In particular, only ventricular cell models have been discussed. A much wider selection of models (including a description of the physiology that they describe) can be found at the online CellML repository (www.cellml.org, and see Lloyd et al., 2004).",

This model predicts the transmembrane potential by modelling cardiac tissue as a homogenised two-phase medium. At each point in the solution space (which must be discretised for the model to make sense), there is an intracellular potential and an extracellular potential. In each space, current flow between the points is modelled by a cable equation. The difference between these two potentials drives a current across the cell membrane, which is modelled at each point as a capacitor connected in parallel with the ionic currents defined in the cellular level model. So, if the bidomain model is solved using FEs (or finite differences) there is a separate cellular model embedded at each node of the mesh (or grid). Simplifications to the bidomain model are sometimes used to reduce the computational requirements of the simulation. The monodomain model is obtained by assuming either that the extracellular potential is constant or that the conductivity tensors for the two domains are proportional. In both cases the equation for the model reduces to a single equation for the intracellular potential. The eikonal-diffusion model (Tomlinson et al., 2002) describes the propagation of a wave front within the cardiac tissue, but does not contain the more detailed description of the shape of the action potential seen in the bidomain and monodomain models. Further, it cannot be coupled to cellular level models (as it only defines the location of the wavefront and has no transmembrane current term), and so cannot be used to model the whole heart consequences of cellular problems (such as long QT syndrome).",

However, other methods have been used for smaller-scale simulations. Early simulation methods (Moe et al., 1964; Restivo et al., 1990; Mitchell et al., 1992) used cellular automata models to allow their simulations to run more quickly. However, the requirement that each cell is in one of a number of discrete states at any given time is physiologically unrealistic. Other studies, such as that of Winslow et al. (1993), have coupled cell models together into small networks by modelling the electrical properties of gap junctions. However, these models require the consideration of every cell\u2013cell interface, making the computational power required well beyond that currently available. There is now a consensus that the bidomain model represents the most accurate representation of the physiology that is numerically tractable.",

            "text": "Many different models have been suggested to describe the mechanics of cardiac tissue, with almost every simulator using a different one. However, there are many similarities between the various models. All use some type of nonlinear, finite elasticity model to describe the passive properties of the tissue. These can be broadly classified according to whether they use exponential (Lin and Yin, 1998; Usyk et al., 2002) or pole-zero law (Hunter et al., 1995) models for the strain energy function. If the simulator uses a geometrical model of the heart (see below) which includes myofibre orientation, then the tissue is usually assumed to be either transversely isotropic (with the direction in which it behaves differently aligned with the fibres) or orthotropic. Where the mechanics is included in a multi-physics model, the coupling is generally achieved by including an \u2018active tension\u2019 term which causes the tissue to contract in response to the electrical activation (Negroni and Lascano, 1996; Hunter et al., 1998; Lin and Yin, 1998; Campbell et al., 2001; Usyk et al., 2002). Generally, the contraction first occurs when the Ca2+ concentration reaches some critical value, acts in the direction of the myofibres (if included in the geometry) and then tails off over time. In some cases (Negroni and Lascano, 1996; Campbell et al., 2001) the active tension is calculated by explicitly modelling the average behaviour of a large number of sarcomeres (which exist at the sub-cellular or cellular level). A natural extension would be to remove the averaging and include active tension at the cellular level. This process has been begun by Matsuoka et al. (2003).",

As with the Auckland work, the mechanical properties are considered at the tissue level and are coupled to a monodomain model of electrical propagation, in this case with an additional diffusion term in the fibre direction (Usyk et al., 2002). The mechanical properties of the cardiac tissue were modelled using the orthotropic model of Usyk et al. (2000), which is responsible for the coupling between the two physical processes. Again, there is no direct feedback from the mechanical model to the electrophysiological model, but the electrophysiological model is solved on a mesh deformed according to the mechanical model.

The simulation of 1.2 s of cardiac activity requires 72 h of computational time on a single processor of a Silicon Graphics Origin 2000 (Usyk and McCulloch, 2003). This is very much faster than the comparable simulation performed by the Auckland group described above. (Recall that this took 3 weeks using 8 processors.) It is not clear exactly why there is such a difference in the simulation times, but one possible reason is that the mesh used in the UCSD work appears to be coarser (48 elements for the mechanical component) than that used in Auckland (128 elements for the mechanical component\u2014both simulators use a finer mesh for the electrophysiology). Since the stability of the explicit Euler method depends on grid spacing this also suggests that a smaller time step is required for the Auckland simulation than the UCSD one, further increasing the computational demands. The trade-off for the additional time required to simulate the system is that the Auckland results may be more accurate due to their finer mesh and smaller time step.

No cellular level model is required as the membrane potential is fully determined at the tissue level. The mechanical model used (also at the tissue level) is due to Kerckhoffs et al. (2003) and is coupled to the electrical propagation model by the presence of an active tension that depends on the passive tension and the time since depolarisation (i.e. active tension is larger immediately after the wave front passes through a region). In simulations that use this method, only the propagation wave front is seen\u2014not the entire action potential. Further, the two physical processes are only weakly coupled: the propagation of the electrical wave is determined first by the solution of the eikonal-diffusion equation and then this is used as an input for the mechanical model\u2014hence there is no feedback mechanism between the two physical processes, reducing the accuracy of the model. However, the trade-off for these simplifications is that the computational time is significantly reduced: one complete cardiac cycle can be computed in approximately 5 h on a Silicon Graphics 64-bit Origin 2000 at 225 MHz (Kerckhoffs et al., 2005).

Hence, the model does not have an electrophysiological component (usually the starting point for an integrative model of the heart), but instead couples the cardiac tissue mechanics to fluid flow within the chambers of the heart. The simulator uses more advanced numerical techniques than many of the alternatives in coupling these two physical processes (only the simulator of Watanabe et al. (2004) is comparable): they are updated simultaneously at each time step using an immersed boundary method (Lai and Peskin, 2000).",

At the cellular level the Luo\u2013Rudy dynamic model (Luo and Rudy, 1994a, Luo and Rudy, 1994b) is coupled to the electroporation model of DeBruin and Krassowska (1998) and a modified version of the model of Zabel et al.

Simulations were performed with the tissue either stretched or unstretched. (Electrical activation does not introduce an active tension or any other mechanism to cause contraction of the cardiac tissue.) An explicit FE method was used, with quadrilateral elements, bilinear basis functions and a spatial resolution of 100 \u03bcm. To date, no organ level results for this model have been published, but the methods described could be generalised to anatomically accurate three-dimensional geometries.",

The heart model is similar to that used by the Auckland group, with the Fenton\u2013Karma equations being coupled to the monodomain model and the explicit Euler method being used to advance in time. Further, the Auckland canine heart model (Nielsen et al., 1991) is used to generate a FD grid at the organ level. Electrical propagation in the torso is also included (with the torso modelled as an isotropic Ohmic resistor) in order to simulate ECG generation. SCAM is noteworthy for its representation of behaviour at the organ system level (the inclusion of a whole torso model). Similar work has since been carried out by Pullan et al. (2003), who have embedded an electromechanical model of the heart within the torso in order to elucidate the contributions of contraction to the ECG.

A phase-field approach is used to overcome the difficulty of applying Neumann boundary conditions to a FD scheme with complex geometry by making the boundary spatially diffuse. The resulting simulator is very fast: 1 s of electrical activity takes approximately 1.5 h to simulate on a single 667 MHz Alpha processor and using a grid with 2.7 million degrees of freedom\u2014although this speed is at least in part due to the very simple cellular level model that is used. Note also that an alternative method for applying Neumann boundary conditions in a FD implementation\u2014the immersed interface method\u2014has been proposed by Dumnet and Keener (2003).

They suggest that they can be solved efficiently by decoupling the extra- and intra-cellular potentials and advancing in time using Euler's method for each in turn. The method is implemented in parallel using MPI. FE methods are preferred to finite differences or finite volumes since they can better deal with the irregular geometry, curved boundaries and inhomogeneous conductivity of the heart. Observe that these simulations of the bidomain equations use more complex cellular models than many of the monodomain simulators discussed above. The use of these more advanced cell models is possible because the reduced computational demands of a single physics simulator in comparison with a multi-physics one outweighs the increase in complexity that results from switching from a monodomain to a bidomain model.",

In order to model an abnormal heart or drug action (rather than a normally beating heart) it will also be necessary to develop models to describe unhealthy cardiac cells and tissue.

In a recent publication (Whiteley, 2006a), it is shown that the speed of the solution of the cell models can be vastly improved (the solution is computed roughly 15 times faster) by using implicit numerical methods for integrating the differential equations. Furthermore, the use of partial evaluation and look-up tables (Cooper et al., 2006) may be used to increase efficiency by a further factor of five. Combining these speedups gives an overall speedup of 40. Further unpublished results by Whiteley suggest that, if one uses a judicious choice of a coarse spatial mesh combined with fine spatial meshes in places where cell activation is under way, it may be possible to speed computation up by a factor of 2500 (compared with computation on a fine mesh alone) with minimal loss of accuracy. The combination of all of Whiteley's and Cooper's techniques should provide a speed-up of several orders of magnitude. However, to our knowledge, only a few of these techniques have been implemented in the solution of real cardiac problems at the time of writing. We might speculate that a single processor could be able to solve 15 min of bidomain simulation time in less than a day of real time.",

Over the course of time, the functionality of neighbouring tissue adapts to the new environment, this phenomenon being known as re-modelling. Experimentalists have produced data from which models of healthy, infarcted and re-modelled tissue may be derived, but the longitudinal study of how tissue morphs from its healthy state is yet to be investigated.

To counteract this susceptibility, clinicians may prescribe a drug treatment and/or allow the heart to be shocked by a pacemaker. The upshot is that to model properly the onset and treatment of cardiac infarction requires the solution of a bidomain simulation of the entire heart for weeks of simulation time, involving a more complicated (and as yet unknown) cell model together with the ion-channel effects of particular drug treatments. Such a simulation would be many orders of magnitude harder to solve than any recent studies and would still not provide the realism of electromechanical coupling or the flow of blood in the heart cavities and blood supply.",

At the present time, many potential prescription drugs fail to come to market because they are discovered to cause the side-effect of elongating the QT phase of the ECG in some patients. This side-effect (which is normally unrelated to the original clinical use of the drug) is dangerous because it may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and fibrillation in a significant population of people taking the medication. Clinical testing on humans occurs towards the end of the drug-development cycle after vast resources have already been spent. If computer models of cardiac function could be used earlier in the cycle in order to screen for long-QT syndrome, then the drug discovery process could be streamlined. In order to do this we would need to be able to run cardiac models for several weeks of simulation time, in healthy and diseased heart models, and to model the interaction of drugs at the cell-membrane level.",

MD simulations have, until recently, usually been restricted to a single scale. At each length scale, advanced and very general simulation packages have been developed over a period of more than 20 years and are based on well established force-field models and solution algorithms. These packages can deal with a wide range of different types of problem (e.g. they are not specific to ion channels). The switch to a less detailed level of functionality (quantum to molecular to coarse-grained) occurs either when the simulations begin to require unrealistically large amounts of time to run or when the amount of memory required to calculate the solution exceeds that available. In heart modelling, on the other hand, much more work has been done on considering how to couple together models from different levels of biological organisation and from different physical processes. The models themselves are at a much more dynamic stage of development, with new models being proposed continuously. The software used to compute solutions of the model equations is also more ad hoc in nature than in MD, with almost every active research group writing their own packages to simulate their models.",

They are now beginning to see some of the computational issues that have already been addressed in MD (simulation times measured in weeks rather than hours and the need for more memory than is ever available). Similarly, the increasing use of multi-scale models in fields such as ion channel modelling is leading to researchers in MD being faced with problems similar to those already being considered in heart modelling. In both fields the use of parallel computing technology is extensively used to reduce the amount of time that is necessary in order to complete the simulation.",

This type of work is beginning to be carried out in projects such as the Physiome Project of the International Union of Physiological Sciences (IUPS) (Kohl et al., 2000; Hunter et al., 2002; Hunter and Borg, 2003) that aims to construct a \u201cquantitative description of the physiological dynamics and functional behaviour of the intact organism\u201d (Bassingthwaighte, 1995). The requirements of projects such as these will give rise to new problems that have not been considered until now. Increased accuracy (both in the model and the numerical techniques used to solve it) is needed in order to simulate very long time scales to prevent the model solution from gradually drifting away from the true behaviour of the system as the simulation progresses. The causes of this drift can be difficult to identify as the problem will not manifest itself in short test runs of the simulator. Solutions related to the biology of the system, such as thermodynamically valid cell models, might be developed in order to reduce this drift. In order to model across the divide between stochastic and deterministic processes, it is possible that entirely new modelling techniques will have to be developed. However, the development of these techniques will likely be necessary in order to fully explain how molecular level interactions (between drugs and proteins) lead to whole organ phenomena such as the long-QT syndrome and, ultimately, the death of whole organisms. Finally, the computational requirements of simulating the very complex models that will result from these types of problem will require the use of very powerful, massively parallel supercomputers and the development of improved numerical algorithms to efficiently implement the parallelisation.",

The active membrane behaviour was described by the rabbit ventricular Puglisi model (Puglisi and Bers, 2001) incorporating an electroporation current (De Bruin and Krassowka, 1998) and a hypothetical Ia current (Cheng et al., 1999). Details of the applied numerical methods are found in Plank et al. (2007). Two plate electrodes, a stimulation electrode and a grounding electrode, were used to stimulate the ventricles by delivering a train of ten pulses (see top panel). Subsequently, electric activity was simulated for another 2 s. Simulations were carried out with Cm=1 \u03bcF cm\u20132 and \u03b2=1400 cm\u20131.
