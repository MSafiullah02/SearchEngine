She denied recent travel or contact with recent travelers or sick individuals. On initial examination, the patient had a temperature of 100.9\u00b0F, a heart rate of 120 beats/min with new-onset atrial fibrillation, and hypoxia, requiring 2 L of oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain an oxygen saturation >90%. Her initial blood pressure was normal. Laboratory evaluation was notable for a normal white blood cell count of 6.2 \u00d7 109 cells/L and a normal complete metabolic panel but a mildly elevated lactate of 2.3 mmol/L. Chest radiography demonstrated moderate bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Her respiratory panel by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was negative, with a pending COVID-19 nasal PCR, and she was placed in isolation. She was treated empirically for community-acquired pneumonia with ceftriaxone and azithromycin and started on a continuous heparin infusion due to new atrial fibrillation.",

Repeat chest radiography demonstrated severe bilateral patchy opacities. She was intubated with a rapid sequence technique without the use of bag-valve-mask ventilation to limit aerosolization. Instead, she was maintained on HFNC for apneic ventilation during intubation, as the transmission rate with HFNC has been shown to be less than with bag-valve-mask ventilation.6 She was initiated on ARDS Clinical Network (ARDSnet) protocols with lung protective strategies but had persistent hypoxia with a Pao2:Fio2 ratio (P:F ratio) <150 despite neuromuscular blockade. She was then ventilated in a prone position, which led to significant improvement in her P:F ratios. Her COVID-19 nasal PCR was positive 24 hours after admission, and her inflammatory markers were elevated, with an interleukin 6 (IL-6) level of 147.3 pg/mL, a ferritin of 3897 mg/dL, and a d-dimer of 1.98 \u00b5g/mL, consistent with poor prognosis. Forty-eight hours after admission, she developed renal and hepatic failure with severe hypotension requiring norepinephrine and vasopressin. Bedside echocardiography demonstrated a newly reduced ejection fraction of 30%\u201335% with apical ballooning, consistent with a stress-induced cardiomyopathy.",

Her procalcitonin and lactate dehydrogenase peaked after broadening of her antimicrobials and downtrended daily. Prone ventilation was stopped when her P:F ratio was maintained over 200 in the supine position. Angiotensin II was discontinued 8 days after its initiation without need for further vasopressors. The patient remains intubated after failing a trial of extubation on hospital day 15 due to respiratory weakness. She is otherwise clinically stable with normalized renal and hepatic function, and repeat chest X-ray after reintubation demonstrated resolution of her ARDS pattern.

            "text": "The use of angiotensin II has multiple possible benefits in patients with COVID-19. First, the now well-described cytokine storm phase of COVID-19 can lead to a profound vasodilatory shock for which angiotensin II is well established as an effective treatment.9 Second, acute renal failure is not uncommon in COVID-19, with up to 11.9% of patients requiring renal replacement therapy.5 A post hoc analysis of the Angiotensin for the Treatment of Vasodilatory Shock (ATHOS)-III trial showed a significant benefit for the use of angiotensin II in patients with vasodilatory shock and renal failure, specifically showing a decrease in number of days on renal replacement therapy compared to other vasopressors.10 This decreased need for renal replacement therapy could have a significant benefit in a resource-limited environment during a pandemic. Third, 1 recent article argues for a physiologic benefit of the use of exogenous angiotensin II to improve a possible angiotensin II deficiency and a possible downregulation of the ACE2 receptor.5 However, the physiologic argument remains controversial. A Chinese study from February 2020 showed a correlation between elevated levels of endogenous angiotensin II and lung injury in patients with COVID-19,11 which raises concerns about the use of exogenous angiotensin II in patients with COVID-19. However, elevated levels of angiotensin II were also noted in patients with vasodilatory shock in the ATHOS-III trial. This angiotensin II elevation was actually found to represent a relative deficiency when compared to markedly elevated angiotensin I levels. In fact, these patients showed significant hemodynamic improvement with angiotensin II infusion,12 which could point toward a therapeutic use for angiotensin II in patients with COVID-19.",

First, it is not frequently used in patients with cardiomyopathies, as the increased afterload can add additional stress to the left ventricle. However, angiotensin II is theoretically beneficial in stress cardiomyopathy, as recommendations have suggested catecholamine-sparing therapy for a stress-induced cardiomyopathy.13 Second, angiotensin II has been linked with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared to other vasopressors,14 which is compounded by the higher risk of VTE found in the ARDS population.15 No thromboembolism was identified in this case, but the patient was already maintained on a heparin infusion due to intermittent atrial fibrillation.",
