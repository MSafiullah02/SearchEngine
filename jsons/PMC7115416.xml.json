Yet at the same time, the number of obstacles preventing the use of those biomedical discoveries for the benefit of mankind has risen almost proportionately. Stricter regulations for safety and efficacy have led to increased cost of production of biomedicals, but secondly the price to the consumer has risen to a degree that now precludes prophylactic vaccination against some diseases on a global scale. In addition to the extraordinarily high price of new vaccines and sera, the method of administration of these products through syringe and needle presents another burden in their worldwide use. In 1958, I organized a mass vaccination trial with my oral polio vaccine in the then Belgian Congo. Two hundred and fifty thousand individuals were vaccinated in 6 weeks by oral spraying. This became a model for worldwide polio vaccination\u2014a project requiring only one oral administration of a product\u2014to eradicate polio in the world. The global use of vaccine requires that the vaccines be inexpensive and easily maintained and distributed. After considering various alternatives of fulfilling the criteria established for a global approach to immunization, it has become clear that our only choice is the production of vaccines or other materials of biomedical importance in plants.",

Various parts of plants (leaves, seeds, fruits, and chloroplasts) can also be used as vehicles for the biomedical products. Production of biomedicals in plants and their administration to humans and animals also provides an added margin of safety as compared to biologicals produced in animal tissues. Early concerns that plants might not be capable of producing biomedicals of animal origin, and that plant-specific glycosylation patterns might functionally alter plant-produced antibodies have proven unwarranted.",

Thus, it was decided on an emergency basis to produce rabies antibody in plants. Research conducted by Dr. Kisung Ko, led to the production of a transgenic tobacco plant containing the heavy and light chains of human rabies antibody. The two chains recombined in the plants to produce a complete antirabies antibody, which was as effective as the original antibody in animals, before and after exposure to rabies (Table 4\n). Two very interesting results emerged from the research with this antibody. First, leaf extract of the transgenic tobacco was found to be virtually free of nicotine and other alkaloids (Fig. 1\n). Second, the glycosylation pattern of the plant-derived antibody was considerably different from that of the animal tissue-derived antibody (Fig. 2\n). Mannose is the only glycan prevalent in the plantibody, yet the antibody was at least as efficacious as the native antibody produced in animals.",
