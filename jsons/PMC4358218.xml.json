            "text": "Herpesviruses are double-stranded DNA viruses which infect many members of the animal kingdom, including mammals, birds and reptiles (McGeoch and Gatherer, 2005), fish (Lepa and Siwicki, 2012), amphibians (Davison et al., 2006), molluscs (Nicolas et al., 1992; Savin et al., 2010), and cnidarians (Vega Thurber et al., 2008; Grasis et al., 2014). They typically infect a large proportion of their target population, spreading through a variety of horizontal and vertical routes. They can cause disease in many settings, e.g., hemorrhage disease in elephants caused by elephant endothelial herpesviruses (Wilkie et al., 2014); cancers caused by the human gammaherpesviruses Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) (Taylor and Blackbourn, 2011); pulmonary infection in cats caused by feline herpesvirus 1 (Thiry et al., 2009) and terrapene herpesvirus 1-associated pneumonia in Eastern box turtles (Sim et al., 2014); seasonal mass mortality in oysters (Nicolas et al., 1992); and herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis in humans (Whitley, 2006). Disease may be associated with primary infection, reactivation of latent infection, immune suppression, or immune senescence. Previous approaches to herpesvirus discovery have utilized a range of methods, discussed in greater depth elsewhere (Bexfield and Kellam, 2011). Briefly, these include: electron microscopy [EBV and cytomegalovirus (CMV); Ho, 2008], PCR-based representational difference analysis (KSHV; Chang et al., 1994), DNA in situ hybridization (chelonid herpesviruses Teifke et al., 2000), immunohistochemistry (alcelaphine herpesviruses Klieforth et al., 2002), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing (primate rhadinoviruses Lacoste et al., 2001, and lizard herpesviruses Wellehan et al., 2004; Literak et al., 2010). Metagenomics is the newest approach to add to this list: a deep-sequencing-based analysis of the nucleic acid contents of a cellular or acellular sample, unreliant on tissue culture and without reference to prior knowledge of which viruses are present in a sample.",

There are also features of herpesvirus molecular biology which increase the likelihood that deep-sequencing studies which are not explicitly metagenomic in nature will nevertheless detect herpesviruses, which may or may not be disease-associated. As widespread DNA viruses, any animal genome sequencing project that uses DNA from primary tissue or samples (e.g., saliva or blood) is likely to include sequences from herpesviruses present in that organism. Even though virus detection is not a primary target of host genome sequencing studies, viruses present in the sample will form a proportion of the sequence reads, and herpesviruses have been discovered in exactly such data (Aswad and Katzourakis, 2014). In this review article, we summarize some of the success stories in identifying novel herpesviruses through metagenomics, and offer a warning on the topic of virus discovery.",

            "text": "Much herpesvirus genome sequencing in the past has relied upon large volumes of DNA, acquired through culturing the virus in permissive cell lines (Baer et al., 1984; Lei et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2013). In uncultured or unenriched samples, herpesvirus DNA is present in much smaller proportions than host DNA (Depledge et al., 2011). Herpesvirus genomes are typically hundreds of kilobases in length, complicating the task of Sanger or ultra-deep sequencing of herpesvirus genomes. The problem of poor virus to host DNA ratios applies equally to herpesvirus discovery. It is perhaps unsurprising that many herpesviruses are identified using consensus or degenerate PCR primer sets, but their genomes remain unsequenced (e.g., Bodewes et al., 2014; Sim et al., 2014). The success of identifying novel herpesviruses or of characterizing their genomes further is influenced by the similarity of the novel herpesvirus to related viruses. Some uncharacterized herpesviruses may map well to related herpesviruses, and are relatively easy to assemble from deep-sequence data, or design consensus primers to amplify. Divergent herpesviruses are more difficult to detect and assemble using traditional methods, mapping poorly to existing reference sequences (Pop, 2009). Highly similar and divergent herpesviruses alike may require de novo assembly to generate accurate consensus sequences, and potentially further PCR and sequencing to fill gaps in the assembly or confirm novel sequences (e.g., Babra et al., 2012). Metagenomics has an important role in identifying and characterizing divergent herpesviruses, and in allowing the discovery of herpesviruses in hosts or tissue types they might not be expected to be found in.",

While EEHVs were known of from traditional PCR and Sanger-based methods, the complete genome sequence proved to be divergent from known herpesviruses, with 60 novel herpesvirus genes identified in the EEHV1A genome (Ling et al., 2013). Whole genome sequencing of EEHV5 revealed further genetic diversity between strains, with only 60% similarity between EEHV1A and EEHV5 (Wilkie et al., 2014), and 25% nucleotide divergence between coding regions of EEHV1A and EEHV2 (Richman et al., 2014).

Untargeted deep and ultra-deep sequencing of mammalian genomes from primary samples can serve as metagenomic datasets for researchers able to re-analyze the data in ways that may not have been anticipated in the original project. Aswad and Katzourakis (2014) screened 14 whole genomes from nine primate sequences available in GenBank for known herpesvirus protein sequence clusters, hoping to identify novel herpesviruses. Characterizing primate herpesvirus diversity is of interest to researchers for a number of reasons: herpesviruses have both zoonotic (Hummeler et al., 1959) and anthroponotic (Huemer et al., 2002) potential in primates, with high fatality rates for humans and non-human primates (Estep et al., 2010); increasing our knowledge of herpesviruses in other species may provide new model systems for understanding how herpesviruses cause disease in humans (Staheli et al., 2014); and the identification of putative endogenous herpesviral elements within primate genomes serves as a fossil record for the herpesviridae (Aswad and Katzourakis, 2014).",

Aswad and Katzourakis analyzed both mapped and unmapped reads from the primate genomes, enabling them to identify both exogenous, and chromosomally integrated, potentially endogenised, herpesviruses. The tarsier herpesvirus sequences were particularly interesting because they are the first report of a potentially endogenous herpesvirus, related to human herpesvirus 6B which chromosomally integrates in a small proportion of humans (Luppi et al., 1993; Tanaka-Taya et al., 2004). The tarsier herpesvirus sequences they reported were heavily mutated, not replication competent and contiguous with stretches of host DNA, supporting the view that this virus has become fully endogenised in tarsier evolutionary history. They were also able to assemble much larger regions of the bonobo (Pan paniscus) herpesvirus Pan paniscus lymphocryptovirus 1 (PpanLCV1), covering an estimated 45% of its genome (\u223c78,000 bp), which was only previously known from small fragments (\u223c3000 bp; Ehlers et al., 2003).",

Using de novo assembly, they found that herpesvirus-like sequences were more common in healthy coral than diseased coral.
