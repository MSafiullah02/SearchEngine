            "text": "Angiotensin (Ang)-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) metabolizes Ang II to the vasodilatory peptide Ang(1-7), while neprilysin (NEP) generates Ang(1-7) from Ang I. Experiments used novel Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectroscopic (MS) assays to study Ang processing. Mass spectroscopy was used to measure proteolytic conversion of Ang peptide substrates to their specific peptide products. We compared ACE/ACE2 activity in plasma, brain and kidney from C57BL/6 and NEP \u2212/\u2212 mice. Plasma or tissue extracts were incubated with Ang I or Ang II (1296 or 1045, m/z, respectively), and generated peptides were monitored with MS. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activity was detected in kidney and brain, but not in plasma. Brain ACE2 activity was highest in hypothalamus. Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 activity was inhibited by the specific ACE2 inhibitor, DX600 (10 \u03bcM, 99% inhibition), but not by the ACE inhibitor, captopril (10 \u03bcM). Both MS and colorimetric assays showed high ACE activity in plasma and kidney with low levels in brain. To extend these findings, ACE measurements were made in ACE overexpressing mice. Angiotensin-converting enzyme four-copy mice showed higher ACE activity in kidney and plasma with low levels in hypothalamus. In hypothalamus from NEP \u2212/\u2212 mice, generation of Ang(1-7) from Ang I was decreased, suggesting a role for NEP in Ang metabolism. With Ang II as substrate, there was no difference between NEP \u2212/\u2212 and wild-type control mice, indicating that other enzymes may contribute to generation of Ang(1-7) . The data suggest a predominant role of hypothalamic ACE2 in the processing of Ang II, in contrast to ACE, which is most active in plasma.",

Using molecular biological, biochemical, immunochemical and genetic approaches, results have shown that the peptide precursor and enzymes required for the formation and degradation of the biologically active forms of Ang, as well as Ang receptors, are present in brain (Lippoldt et al. 1995; Allen et al. 1998; Morimoto & Sigmund, 2002) . However, despite the multitude of studies on the brain RAS, there is little information on regulation of enzymatic activity. The focus has instead been on localization of enzymes, peptides and receptors and their mRNAs. There is evidence for ACE activity in brain areas lacking a blood-brain barrier, such as the subfornical organ and pineal gland (Saavedra, 1992; Jouquey et al. 1995) . However, levels are low, with activity in the range of picomoles per milligram protein per hour. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is present in a wide variety of tissues, including heart, kidney and central nervous system (CNS; Harmer et al. 2002; Gembardt et al. 2005; Ferrario, 2006) . Gallagher and co-workers reported that Ang II downregulates ACE2 mRNA in astrocytic cultures, resulting in lower levels of Ang(1-7); however, activity of Ang(1-7)-generating enzymes was not measured (Gallagher et al. 2006) . We used in situ hybridization to measure ACE2 mRNA in brainstem and found a relationship between Angiotensin type 1a receptor (Ang AT1a) and ACE2 expression (Lin et al. 2008 ).",

Nevertheless, there are questions concerning the means by which the central RAS functions, particularly the relationship between ACE and ACE2 in regulation of brain angiotensin peptide metabolism. With this knowledge gap in mind, we developed a research programme to examine the regulation of ACE and ACE2 activity in brain. We took advantage of newly developed mass spectrometric (MS) methods for measuring enzyme activity and angiotensin proteolytic processing (Elased et al. 2005 (Elased et al. , 2006 . The methods are sensitive and specific and offer advantages over traditional assays because they provide data on peptide precursors and precise proteolytic products. The experimental goal was to study brain angiotensin peptide metabolism, with a focus on ACE and ACE2, using pharmacological tests and genetic models. Lu et al. 1995) . Mice with two or four functional copies of the Ace gene at its normal chromosomal location (Krege et al. 1997) were raised at Wright State University from breeding pairs obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Animals were housed at 22 \u2022 C under a 12 h light-12 h dark cycle with ad libitum access to water and standard mouse chow.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activity is expressed as the ratio between product, Ang(1-7), and substrate, Ang II. Figure 1 is an example of a typical SELDI-TOF-MS peptide chromatographic profile for an ACE2 assay in plasma (Fig. 1A) , kidney ( Fig. 1B) and hypothalamus (Fig. 1C ) from normal C57Bl/6 mice. The two MS peaks seen in Fig. 1B and C are the assay substrate, Ang II (1045, m/z), and peptide product, Ang(1-7) (899, m/z). Data provide evidence for ACE2-like activity in kidney and brain with no detectable activity in plasma. Incubation of Ang II with heat-inactivated brain tissue failed to generate Ang(1-7) (data not shown). Based on these findings, we measured ACE2 activity in various brain regions (Table 1 ). The ACE2 activity was highest in hypothalamus and lowest in brainstem and pituitary. The linearity of the MS ACE2 assay is shown in Fig. 2 , in which varying concentrations of a hypothalamic extract (20-80 ng protein) were tested for ACE2 activity. There was a linear relationship between protein concentration and ACE2 activity (r 2 = 0.92).",

The premise was that under conditions of globally high ACE activity, we might expect to measure ACE activity in brain. The ACE activity was measured in kidney, brain and plasma from C57BL/6 (two-copy) or ACE overexpression mice (four-copy; Fig. 7 ). Hypothalamic ACE activity was low to undetectable compared with kidney and plasma in ACE two-copy mice. As expected, kidney and plasma ACE activity were significantly higher in ACE four-copy Tissue Ratio Ang II / Ang I Figure 7 . Effect of number of Ace gene copies on ACE activity in hypothalamus, kidney and plasma Angiotensin I (10 \u03bcM) was incubated with hypothalamic or kidney extracts (1 \u03bcg protein) or plasma (0.5 \u03bcl) from C57BL/6 (two-copy) or ACE four-copy mice for 2 h at 37 \u2022 C. Activity of ACE was expressed as the ratio of Ang II to Ang I. Values are means + S.E.M. Student's unpaired t test analysis showed * P < 0.05 versus control two-copy kidney and * * P < 0.01 versus control two-copy plasma. mice (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively) compared with control mice. There was no evidence for brain ACE activity in the ACE four-copy animals, suggesting that global overexpression of the Ace gene does not translate into functional changes in the brain.",

Since this system is a complex of bioactive peptides with a regulatory enzymatic cascade, characterization of current and prospective drugs requires data on peptide processing as well as sensitive proteolytic enzyme assays. There is much clinical interest in measurement of renin and ACE activity as biomarkers for disease states such as hypertension, diabetes, heart failure and renal dysfunction. However, recent data indicate that Ang(1-7), a product of the carboxypeptidase, ACE2, may be important in regulating cardiovascular function (Tipnis et al. 2000; Vickers et al. 2002; Ferrario, 2006) . Like ACE, the substrate affinity of ACE2 is not confined to the RAS; for example, it also efficiently degrades des-Arg 9 bradykinin (Vickers et al. 2002; Huang et al. 2003) . However, it is the ability of ACE2 to inactivate the vasoconstrictor, Ang II, and to generate the metabolite, Ang(1-7), that implicates ACE2 as an important participant in cardiovascular homeostasis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and Ang(1-7) become potential targets in the development of novel therapeutic agents for cardiovascular disease (Raizada & Ferreira, 2007) .",

We have taken advantage of MS technology to develop proteolytic assays for ACE, ACE2 and renin activities in plasma and tissue (Elased et al. 2005; 2006) . The proteolytic angiotensin peptide products are identified by m/z and quantified by peak intensity. Results show that the enzymatic reactions produce the predicted angiotensin peptides with inhibition by specific inhibitors. For example, incubation of plasma with Ang I resulted in formation of Ang II with a linear relationship between substrate depletion and product formation. There was also a correlation between incubation time and product formation. In the present study, we exploited the sensitivity and selectivity of SELDI-TOF-MS to study brain ACE and ACE2 and other enzymes such as NEP which generate Ang(1-7) from Ang I and Ang II. The assay system allows for relative comparison of multiple proteolytic enzymes contributing to angiotensin peptide processing in brain. Plasma and kidney were used as known sources of ACE and ACE2, respectively, and provided a means of comparison with brain. The goal was to address the ability of brain tissue to metabolize Ang I and Ang II and to directly evaluate the contributions of ACE/ACE2 activity. Proteolytic enzyme activities were measured directly rather than using other indices of the RAS such as protein levels or mRNA expression.",

The substrate peptide contains a fluorescent 7-methoxycoumarin group which is quenched by energy transfer to a 2,4-dinitrophenyl group. A fluorogenic peptide substrate, Mca-Y-V-A-D-A-P-K (Dnp)-OH is used to measure activity of ACE2 or peptidases that are capable of cleaving an amide bond between the fluorescent and quencher groups. Examples of other enzymes that would be active in this assay are ACE (Wysocki et al. 2006) , caspase-1 and interleukin-converting enzyme (Enari et al. 1996) . The assay has been improved by the use of a different fluorogenic substrate, Mca-A-P-K (Dnp)-OH, which is more specific for ACE2 (Vickers et al. 2002; Guy et al. 2003) . It is also possible to use radioactive angiotensin peptides ( 125 I-Ang I and 125 I-Ang II) for the study of angiotensin metabolism and as a screen for ACE2 activity in kidney and heart (Ferrario et al. 2005b; Shaltout et al. 2007) . While this approach is reliable and accurate, it is time consuming and requires the use of radioactivity and chromatographic separation of substrate and peptide products. The advantage of the MS-based methods is the ability to utilize endogenous peptide substrates for ACE and ACE2 without the need of synthetic, artificial fluorogenic or radioactive substrates.",

In fact, there was no evidence for ACE activity in brain even though it was easily detected in kidney and plasma. This was seen using either the MS proteolytic or the conventional colorimetric assay. Furthermore, a test using a model of ACE overexpression (Krege et al. 1997) failed to show evidence for ACE activity in hypothalamus. This occurred even though there were markedly higher ACE levels in plasma and kidney in the four-copy ACE mice. Most studies of brain ACE have relied on the use of immunochemical methods (Johren et al. 1997) or receptor binding assays (Chai et al. 1987; Rogerson et al. 1995; Johren & Saavedra, 1996) to support the idea of an active brain ACE system. A recent study reports that brain ACE activity is low in brain of perindopril-treated mice (Eckman et al. 2006) . Results showed more than 90% inhibition of serum ACE with only a slight inhibition of brain ACE even though perindopril readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Using HPLC separation with radioimmunoassay, brain Ang II levels were undetectable despite pooling the tissue from three mice (Alexiou et al. 2005) . There are also data from an in situ hybridization study which revealed low levels of ACE mRNA throughout the mouse hypothalamus (Johren & Saavedra, 1996) . Nevertheless, low brain ACE activity under normal conditions does not rule out the possibility of enhanced activity during pathophysiological situations.",

This is an unexpected finding because Ang II and its receptors are present and active in the brain (reviewed by McKinley et al. 2003) . Injection of Ang II peripherally or centrally activates brain systems, with effects blocked by angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers. However, these experiments rely on the response to exogenous peptide or antagonist administration, which is not the same as the endogenous state. It would be interesting to determine whether there are changes in brain ACE and ACE2 activity in animals or humans with cardiovascular dysfunction. Indeed, a recent study using db/db and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice showed an alteration in ACE and ACE2 activity compared with non-diabetic control mice (Wysocki et al. 2006) . Studies using adenovirus small hairpin RNA (shRNA) for AT1a injected directly into the brainstem also documented interactions between angiotensin AT1a and ACE2 (Lin et al. 2008) .",

In an effort to understand the mechanisms that implicate NEP and the RAS in generation of Ang(1-7) in brain, experiments were performed using NEP-deficient mice. Our data showed that Ang(1-7)-forming activity from Ang I was significantly lower in hypothalamus from NEP \u2212/\u2212 mice. However, Ang(1-7)-forming activity from Ang II, putative ACE2 activity, was not altered in these mice. This supports the idea that brain ACE2 has a distinct role in inactivating Ang II which is separate from NEP. Our data also showed that conversion of Ang I to Ang(1-7) was not inhibited by the ACE2 inhibitor, DX600, which suggested that NEP might be involved in this metabolic pathway. Indeed, there are data which support the idea that NEP plays a role in generation of Ang(1-7) (Chappell et al. 1989; Welches et al. 1991) . Taken together, the data indicate minimal importance for ACE in brain metabolism. If there was an abundant supply of functional ACE, there would be sequential production of Ang II and Ang(1-7); something which is not seen.",

            "text": "Measurement of circulating forms of ACE2 has proved problematical. In normal plasma, we found no evidence of ACE2 activity. A recent clinical trial showed that plasma ACE2 was detectable in <10% of individuals, within a study population of 500 (Rice et al. 2006) . While there is evidence showing Ang(1-7) in plasma and urine which is physiologically regulated, the source of the peptide is not certain (Brosnihan et al. 2004; Ferrario et al. 2005a) . A recent study in sheep demonstrated the presence of serum ACE2 activity which converted Ang II to Ang(1-7) but did not cleave Ang I into Ang-(1-9) (Shaltout et al. 2007 ). In rats, ACE2 was measured in plasma and found to be increased after coronary arterial ligation (Ocaranza et al. 2006) . It was surprising that the increase in rat plasma ACE2 activity was not associated with an increase in plasma Ang(1-7), but rather with an increase in Ang (1-9). This would suggest that ACE2 preferentially cleaves Ang I rather than Ang II. This observation does not agree with our data or with previous studies which demonstrate that Ang II is efficiently cleaved by ACE2, almost 400-fold more active with Ang II as substrate compared with Ang I (Vickers et al. 2002) . We also found no evidence for ACE2dependent formation of Ang(1-9) from Ang I (data not shown). Therefore, an important criterion for in vivo ACE2 activity would be detection of increased Ang(1-7) . The generation of Ang(1-7) in the brain was not inhibited by Z-PP, a selective inhibitor of prolyl-endopeptidase, which is capable of generating Ang(1-7). It was not possible to address the possible activity of prolyl carboxypeptidase (EC 3.4.16.2) in the generation of Ang(1-7) in the brain because all the assays were carried out in the presence of 2 mm PMSF, an inhibitor of prolyl carboxypeptidase (Odya et al. 1978) .",
