            "text": "Camelids, the only surviving members of the mammalian group Tylopoda are represented by the New World camelids (Alpaca, Llama, Guanaco and Vicuna) and the Old World camelids (the dromedary and Bactrian camel). The Camelids, believed to have originated in North America during the Eocene period, have exquisitely adapted to inhabit harsh conditions like the hot deserts of Africa and Asia, cold deserts of central Asia and high altitudes of South America (Bravo, 2015). In spite of this diverse distribution and habitats, they seem to share a similar genetic makeup as evidenced by their identical chromosome number (2n = 74) and molecular data emerging from the recent genome sequencing of some of these members (Bravo, 2015). The dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius), one of the major Camelid members is estimated to be domesticated around 3000 BC in the Arabian Peninsula and is an integral part of the life and culture of the region. Although considered a hardy Camelid species, they are also susceptible to many of the diseases of domestic animals (Bravo, 2015). One of the unique features of the camelid humoral immune system is the presence of heavy\u2013chain antibodies (HCAbs) lacking the l-chain, the potential immunological application of HCAbs as nanobodies has evoked considerable interest in antibody-based therapeutics (Muyldermans et al., 2009). Compared to other domestic animals like cattle, pig and horse, investigations into the molecular immunology of dromedary camels have been limited, with only a few cytokines and other immune molecules cloned from the dromedary camels (Nagarajan et al., 2012, Odbileg et al., 2006, Premraj et al., 2013). Recently it has been reported that dromedary camels are infected by zoonotic viruses like MERS Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and act as intermediate hosts that transmit the virus to human (Adney et al., 2014, Memish et al., 2014). For a better understanding of the dromedary camel immune system during viral infection, the availability of species specific reagents for analyzing the major host immune regulatory proteins are essential. This necessitates the identification and isolation of major cytokines of the species which play an important role in the induction of antiviral response.",

Although the members of this family share low amino acid identity, they share a similar helical structure and functionally target homologous but diverse class II cytokine receptors (Sabat, 2010). Like other members of the IL-10 family, IL-26 also utilizes a hetero-dimeric receptor, IL-26R comprising of IL-20R1 and IL-10R2 receptors. Binding of IL-26 to IL-26R induces signal transduction by phosphorylation and activation of STAT3 and STAT1 (H\u00f6r et al., 2004, Sheikh et al., 2004). Initially denoted as AK155, IL-26 was identified in Herpesvirus saimiri transformed human T cells and later included as a member of the IL-10 family of cytokines (Knappe et al., 2000). IL-26 is also expressed by activated Th1, Th17, stimulated natural killer (NK) and peripheral mononuclear blood cells (Braum et al., 2013). Of late, IL-26 is gaining significance because of its purported role in many pro-inflammatory diseases and its upstream position in the pro-inflammatory cascade and as the potential drug target for chronic inflammatory disorders (Corvaisier et al., 2012). It has been recently reported that IL-26 is over-expressed in chronically HCV infected patients, enhancing the tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) mediated cytotoxicity and induction of expression of the antiviral cytokines IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 (Miot et al., 2014).",

It is also presumed that these three genes are co-regulated, as IL-26 is reported to be co-transcribed along with IL-22 and IFN-\u03b3 (Braum et al., 2013). The human IL-26 gene consists of five exons, which are interrupted by four introns \u2013 three small and one large intron (Knappe et al., 2000). The IL-26 gene is conserved across vertebrates, but interestingly found absent in mouse genome where only short exon fragments of the gene were identified (Braum et al., 2012). Recently, it has been reported that IL-26 is independently inactivated by mutations in exon 2, in several mammals including the members of the Equidae family, African elephant and European hedgehog (Shakhsi-Niaei et al., 2013). There are no reports on the identification and isolation of IL-26 gene from any of the camelids to date.",

It is estimated that around 95% of the human multi exon genes undergo alternative splicing (Pan et al., 2008). As an evolutionary tool, alternative splicing serves as an economical mechanism to produce diversity and specificity at the cellular, tissue or developmental levels and along with non-sense mediated decay, it provides a trial and error mechanism for the evolution of gene structure (Boue et al., 2003). IL-26 has also been reported to undergo alternative splicing in horse, where the gene has been predicted to be inactivated. In this paper we describe the molecular structure of the dromedary camel IL-26 gene and the identification of the novel transcript variants generated by alternative splicing. This is the first report of alternative splicing of IL-26 gene, from a species in which the gene has not been inactivated. The tissue specific distribution of the variants as well as the effect of viral infection on transcription was also studied in cell culture system.",

The members of the IL-10 family of cytokines are characterized by a predominantly alpha helical structure composed of five to seven alpha helices. The helices are arranged to form a compact bundle with hydrophobic amino acids constituting an internal hydrophobic core, which is stabilized by one to three disulphide bridges (Zdanov, 2010). The predicted mature protein of the camel IL-26 also seems to be predominantly alpha helical with the helices constituting around 70.6% of the total structure. Six alpha helical bundles have been predicted for the mature protein encoded by Tv1 (Fig. 1\n). The crystal structure of IL-26 has not been reported so far and structural models have been predicted based on already identified structures of other IL-10 family cytokines \u2013 human IL-10 and IL-19. The structure of IL-26 based on the IL-19 scaffold has been proposed to be a better model than IL-10 as evidenced by the proper alignment of the cysteine residues. Further data suggest both IL-19 and IL-26 can bind to the same receptor IL20R1 (Donnelly et al., 2010). The mature dromedary camel IL-26 features five conserved cysteine residues (at amino acid positions 32, 79, 102, 121 and 124) reported to be conserved in other mammalian IL-26 homologs also (Fig. 1\n). The IL-26 structure based on the IL-19 scaffold suggests that Cysteine pairs Cys-32/Cys-124 and Cys-79/Cys-121 form disulphide bonds, whereas Cys-102 at the N-terminal end of helix D may be involved in intermolecular disulphide bonds facilitating dimerization (Donnelly et al., 2010).",

In the camel and human IL-26, the second motif conform to the signature sequence, whereas the first motif is only partially matched (Fig. 2). IL-26 is unique among the members of the IL-10 family due to its highly cationic nature. Human IL-26 has a predicted isoelectric point (pI) of 10.7 which is mainly attributed to the presence of 30 Lys and Arg residues in the mature protein (Braum et al., 2012). The camel IL-26 also has a predicted pI of 10.45 and has 27 Lys and Arg residues in the 150 amino acid mature protein. The Tv2 with the 114 aa mature protein has an estimated pI value of 10.3 with 19 Lys and Arg residues. Similarly Tv3 with the 142 aa mature protein has 23 Lys and Arg residues and a predicted pI of 10.69. IL-26 is reported to have a high heparin binding affinity due to the strong positive charge and the helix A-B region has been suggested as the heparin binding domain for the cytokine (H\u00f6r et al., 2004). Due to the affinity of IL-26 to heparin, the secreted IL-26 is presumed to bind immediately to glycosaminoglycan moieties on cell surfaces which leads to local recruitment and enrichment of the IL-26 protein on cell surfaces (Braum et al., 2012).",

Based on the alignment of the cDNA sequences with the C. ferus genomic sequence, it could be inferred that the IL-26 isoforms are generated by alternative splicing through different mechanisms. Alternative splicing is a versatile mechanism to increase protein diversity in which diverse transcripts potentially encoding diverse proteins are produced from the same locus of the genome. Recent studies have revealed that many of these alternative splice variants, previously presumed to encode truncated protein variants are actually targeted by a eukaryotic mRNA surveillance mechanism called Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) (Lareau et al., 2007). Alternative splicing combined with NMD serves as an elegant method of regulating gene expression in eukaryotes. It has been proposed that a termination codon located more than 50 bp upstream of the last exon junction is recognized as premature termination codon (PTC) and the transcript is subjected to NMD (Nagy and Maquat, 1998). We analyzed in-silico whether the four alternative IL-26 transcript variants could be subjected to NMD based on this rule. For Cd-IL26 Tv2, Cd-IL26 Tv3 and Cd-IL26 Tv5 variants the new stop codons are located only 46, 38 and 20 bp upstream from the last exon junction (Fig. 5) and hence may not be subjected to NMD. The Cd-IL26-Tv4 like the normal Cd-IL-26-Tv1 does not have any interrupting stop codon and hence not subjected to NMD. It appears that all the four transcript variants could be translated normally without NMD and encode IL-26 protein isoforms. However, some of these variant protein isoforms may differ in their activity when compared with the canonical IL-26 protein as the truncated variants lack required regions for receptor binding.",

            "text": "The coding sequences for first four helices of IL-26 protein (Helices A\u2013D) are encoded by the Exon 1\u2013Exon 3. The amino acid sequences of these four helices are identical in all the five transcript variants (Fig. 6A). The second IL-10 signature motif located in the helix F (amino acid residue sequence KAISELDILLSWIK) is completely conserved in human, camel and other mammalian IL-26 (Fig. 1) proteins and contains the amino acids predicted to be involved in binding to the IL20R1 receptor chain (Donnelly et al., 2010). The truncated proteins predicted to be encoded by the variants Tv2, Tv3 and Tv5 lack this motif (Figs. 6A and B) and may exert different biological action compared to the wild type. Among the IL-10 family of cytokines, alternative splicing has been reported in IL-10 (Wu et al., 2005) and IL-24 (Sahoo et al., 2008). In IL-10, the alternative splice variant IL-10 \u03b43 lacking exon 3 was observed in children with relapsed childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). It was proposed that IL-10 \u03b43 isoform may be involved in modulating IL-10 mediated biological effects and the expression of IL-10 \u03b43 isoform was correlated with a better response to chemotherapy in relapsed childhood ALL (Wu et al., 2005). Splice variants lacking exons 3 and 5 of human IL-24 were identified from normal melanoblasts, and the loss of the expression of this splice variant was associated with metastatic melanoma (Allen et al., 2004). In mouse, a novel splice variant of IL-24/FISP, lacking 29 nucleotides from 5\u2032 end of exon 4 was identified and designated as FISP-sp. This variant, unlike the normal IL-24/FISP was not secreted but was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, dimerised with FISP and inhibited FISP induced apoptosis (Sahoo et al., 2008). Alternative splice variants in many cytokines have been reported to act as functional antagonists of the corresponding wild-type cytokines and suggest that the alternative splicing in response to various stimuli can significantly alter the cellular activity (Sahoo and Im, 2010). The identification of the transcript variants from dromedary camel IL-26 is the first report of alternative splicing for IL-26 in species in which the gene has not been inactivated. Based on whole transcriptome data and RT-PCR, alternative transcripts have been identified in horse IL-26, but the gene in horse has been inactivated by one base pair deletion in exon2 and this gene inactivating mutation is conserved in related species like the Przewalski\u2019s horse and donkey (Shakhsi-Niaei et al., 2013). The protein expression, localization and functional activity of the camel IL-26 isoforms need to be evaluated in future studies.",

IL-26 transcripts were detected from lymph node, liver, blood and spleen (Fig. 7\nA). IL-26 is primarily produced by activated T-cells, but has also been reported to be expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, subsets of NK cells from secondary lymphoid organs (Braum et al., 2013) and certain types of synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis (Corvaisier et al., 2012). In liver lesions from HCV infected patients, the IL-26 expression is attributed to the activity of infiltrating lymphocytes and hepatocytes did not seem to express IL-26 (Miot et al., 2014). Among the camel tissues, lymph node seemed to have all the five alternative splice variants, whereas four variants were detected in blood and spleen. Apart from one report of alternate splice variants in horse kidney and liver (Shakhsi-Niaei et al., 2013), there is no other information on tissue distribution of alternate splice variant of IL-26. Splice variants Tv2 and Tv3 seemed to be up regulated in-vitro stimulated camel PBMC (Fig. 7\nB). Infection of camel fibroblasts with camel pox virus seem to induce the expression of IL-26 Tv2 (Fig. 8). IL-26 expression is reported to be induced upon Herpesvirus and Hepatitis C virus infection (Knappe et al., 2000, Miot et al., 2014). It may be noted that the Tv2 and Tv3 lack the characteristic IL-10 signature motif and residues predicted to be involved in binding to the IL20R1 receptor.",
