One experiment involved seeding a residential toilet with S. marcescens to measure airborne concentrations after flushing [9], and found that the abundance of S. marcescens in the air increased sharply, from zero CFU/m3(colony-forming units per cubic meter) to 1370 CFU/m3 after the first flushing. A similar study was recently conducted in a hospital to determine the concentration of Clostridium difficile following flushing [11]. The present authors investigated the emission strength of three pathogens following toilet flushing under flushometer and cistern tank scenarios [12]. Airborne emission was evidenced, and the emission for the first flush was found to be strongly correlated with bacteria sizes. This was an important finding, which demonstrated bacteria aerosolization, environmental contamination, and potential biological exposure from toilet flushing. With the extremely high load of viable pathogens found in feces, toilet flushing can be a potential source of infection [6,8].",

Our experiment is the first pilot study to test the use of this configuration for the inactivation of flushing-generated contaminants.

For the localized configuration, lamps with two power levels were used: 5 W and 10 W (Philips, PL-S, TUV), each of them with a ballast housed in a water-resistant clear Perspex box.",

Nonetheless, it was not necessary to measure the absolute intensity. In this study, we measured the intensity of the UV-C lamps by using a radiometer (IL1400 A, International Light Technologies) equipped with a suitable detector, with a sensitivity peak at 254 nm wavelength.

A light sensor was held at eye level by the left hand of a volunteer wearing UV-C protective glasses, while the volunteer\u2019s right hand pressed the flushing handle [see Supplementary Information]. This important parameter facilitated direct comparison, with reference to the guidelines of the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) [26]. Likewise, the UV-C intensities of the UR-UVGI installation (at heights of 2.05 m) were measured. Moreover, as ozone is a by-product of UV-C emission and a harmful pollutant, emission of this gas in a confined environment such as a toilet becomes a critical health concern [27].

The Z-value is the value that indicates the degree of sensitivity of microorganisms to the bactericidal effects of UV-C. The higher the z-value, the more susceptible is the microorganism to killing by the UV-C irradiation [32]. It is very difficult to obtain published Z-values for all the three bacteria tested in this study. The only obtainable previously published Z values of these bacteria showed that E. coli (Z = 0.10575 m2/J and Z = 0.50628 m2/J for surface and airborne disinfections, respectively) are more susceptible to UV-C than S. Epidermidis (0.12670 m2/J for airborne disinfection) [32]. Additionally, the Z values also revealed that the susceptibility of E. coli to UV-C is also higher in airborne disinfection than surface disinfection. This explains the reason why our results showed that localized UV lamps achieved a much higher disinfection efficacy for E. coli (97.75 \u00b1 1.62%) and S. epidermidis (76.31 \u00b1 1.92%) in airborne disinfection while the opposite trend was observed from the surface samples (i.e. more S. epidermidis (84.91 \u00b1 3.6%) is being removed, but for E. coli, only about 61.10 \u00b1 5.6% removal for 5 W lamp system).

In fact, very high effectiveness of UR-UVGI has been reported in previous applications, such as TB isolation rooms or homeless shelters [33,34]. Three inter-related issues; emission characteristic, air mixing, and dose, attributed to the results. The emission characteristics of previous applications are very different from the toilet flushing conditions examined in this study. Most previous work on applying UVGI is for the well-mixed environment [25,35,36]. It should also be noted, however, that toilet emission is episodic with \u201cinitial\u201d and \u201cstrong\u201d emission stages of a toilet flushing. It has been found that improper air mixing can decrease the efficiency of UR-UVGI by around 80% [37]. Finally the difference in performance can also be attributed to the UV-C doses received by the micro-organisms. If the ACH is 8 h\u22121, the residence time of micro-organisms is 450 s, but for an episodic event such as flushing a toilet, the UV-C dose received by the micro-organisms is substantially shorter than 450 s. As the ventilation exhaust grill is located right above the toilet bowl, it is anticipated that the residence time would be approximately 10 s. The current and existing studies are indicators that synergistic effect of UR-UVGI, localized UV lamps and ventilation would produce higher disinfection efficiency than individual disinfection mechanism.",

The average dose would only be 4.6% of the guideline-recommended dose limit (6 mJ/cm2). Thus, the doses from the localized UV-C source did not appear to pose any health threat to the users\u2019 eyes or skin under normal circumstances. However, for persons such as janitors, who may need to repeatedly bend down to clean toilet bowls, the UV-C dose exposure is expected to be higher. To avoid over-exposure, the UV-C sources can be turned off during the cleaning period. Similarly, the ozone emissions from both localized UV-C sources were three to eight times less than the acceptable limit.

This result was attributed to the upward motion generated by flushing in the absence of mechanical ventilation.

For a standard density spherical droplet, the settling velocities are 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 m/s and 3.05 \u00d7 10-3 m/s for 1 \u03bcm and 10 \u03bcm, respectively. Assume the settling distance is 10 cm to contaminate a surface, it would take 2800s to 32 s. In practice, for mechanically ventilated toilets, the air exchange rate can be as high as 18 h-1 which leads the residence time to be approximately 200 s. If toilets have no mechanical ventilation, the residence time can be very long, say 30 min. To sum up, it implies that particle sizes at the upper end of the emission range could contaminate surfaces more readily than those smaller particles.

The pyrimidines and purine nucleic acid bases, which are the basic building blocks of DNA, absorb the photons directly from the photoproducts caused by UV-C irradiation [[38], [39], [40]]. Studies on photoreactivation of various microorganisms have also established that bacteria had developed DNA repair mechanism in an attempt to restore the structure and function of DNA [41,42]. Once the maximal capacity for DNA repair is reached, additional UV-C exposure is able to kill the micro-organisms, causing an exponential drop in bacteria counts, as depicted by an exponential order of death seen in the survival curves of micro-organisms subjected to UV-C. This pattern might also explain our findings that there were no significant differences in disinfection efficacy between 5 W and 10 W lamps in most of the cases. This finding might also show that a UV-C lamp of less than 5 W is already capable of surpassing the micro-organisms\u2019 maximal DNA repair capability, and that additional benefits of stepping up the UV-C to a 10 W rating would be insignificant.

Not only would such systems improve the air quality of washrooms, but also no secondary harmful products would be generated as in spray disinfection products. Another feature is the compact size. With the advance of electronic technology, the ballast and the UV-C tube can be made further smaller. Further investigations are recommended to test the effectiveness of such disinfection systems on other types of bacteria, and further improvements may result from more systematic designs and tests of UV-C source systems.",

            "text": "This study has evaluated the efficacy of UR-UVGI and localized UV-C devices for the disinfection of flushing-generated pathogens. The physical sizes of localized UV-C devices are smaller, and their levels of electrical power consumption used for disinfection are lower than those of UR-UVGI systems. Comparisons between these two forms of engineering controls showed significant differences in performance. The localized UV-C systems performed two times better than the UR-UVGI for disinfecting airborne samples, and five times better for disinfecting surface samples. The results of this study suggest that maximal disinfection of air in the washroom micro-environment was attained at source control before dispersal than the use of upper-room irradiation for dispersed emitted bacteria throughout the washroom. Inferring from the observed results, we conclude that the use of localized UV-C lamps is a feasible alternative approach for minimizing human exposure to pathogen emissions from toilet plumes.",
