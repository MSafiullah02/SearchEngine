Most of the basic theory had been developed during that time, but the theoretical progress has been steady since then [14] . Mathematical models are being increasingly used to elucidate the transmission of several diseases. These models, usually based on compartment models, may be rather simple, but studying them is crucial in gaining important knowledge of the underlying aspects of the infectious diseases spread out [63] , and to evaluate the potential impact of control programs in reducing morbidity and mortality.",

Traditionally, the study of disease dynamics has been focused on identifying the mechanisms responsible for epidemics but has taken little into account economic constraints in analyzing control strategies. On the other hand, economic models have given insight into optimal control under constraints imposed by limited resources, but they are frequently ignored by the spatial and temporal dynamics of the disease. Therefore, progress requires a combination of epidemiological and economic factors for modelling what until here tended to remain separate. More recently, bioeconomic approaches to disease management have been advocated, since infectious diseases can be modelled thinking that the limited resources involved require trade-offs. Finding the optimal strategy depends on the balance of economic and epidemiological parameters that reflect the nature of the host-pathogen system and the efficiency of the control method.",

This principle has provided research with suitable conditions for optimization problems with differential equations as constraints. The Russian team generalized variational problems by separating control and state variables and admitting control constraints. In such problems, OC gives equivalents results, as one would have expected. However, the two approaches differ and the OC approach sometimes affords insight into a problem that might be less readily apparent through the calculus of variations. OC is also applied to problems where the calculus of variations is not convenient, such as those involving constraints on the derivatives of functions [80] .",

The accuracy and robustness of a direct method is highly dependent upon the method used. Nevertheless, it is easier to formulate highly complex problems in a direct way and can be used standard NLP solvers as an extra advantage. This last feature has the benefit of converging with poor initial guesses and being extremely computationally efficient since most of the solvers exploit the sparsity of the derivatives in the constraints and objective function.",

In 1978, the United Nations promoted an ambitious agreement between the countries forecasting that in the year 2000 infectious diseases would be eradicated. This conjecture failed, mainly due to the assumption that the microorganisms were biologically stationary and consequently they were not modified and became resistant to the medicines. Besides, the improvements in the transportation allowing for a faster movement of individuals and the population growing especially in developing countries, led to the appearance of new diseases and the resurgence of old ones in distinct places. Nowadays, AIDS is the most scrutinized.

The first one is characterized by a sudden high fever without respiratory symptoms, accompanied by intense headaches, painful joints and muscles and lasts between three to seven days. Humans may only transmit the virus during the febrile stage [33] . DHF initially exhibits a similar, if more severe pathology as DF, but deviates from the classic pattern at the end of the febrile stage [54] . The hemorrhagic form has an additionally bleeding from the nose, mouth and gums or skin bruising, nausea, vomiting and fainting due to low blood pressure by fluid leakage. It usually lasts between two to three days and can lead to death [36] . Nowadays, Dengue is the mosquito-borne infection that has become a major international public health concern. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 50 to 100 million Dengue Fever infections occur yearly, including 500000 Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever cases and 22000 deaths, mostly among children [141] .",

The main difficulty in the vaccine production is that there is a limited understanding of how the disease typically behaves and how the virus interacts with the immune system. Another challenge is that some studies show that some secondary Dengue infection can leave to DHF, and theoretically a vaccine could be a potential cause of severe disease if a solid immunity is not established against the four serotypes. Research to develop a vaccine is ongoing and the incentives to study the mechanism of protective immunity are gaining more support, now that the number of outbreaks around the world is increasing [33] .",

Humans not only provide blood meals for mosquitoes, but also nutrients needed for them to reproduce through water-holding containers, in and around their homes. In urban areas, Aedes mosquitoes breed on water collections in artificial containers such as cans, plastic cups, used tires, broken bottles and flower pots. With increasing urbanization, crowded cities, poor sanitation and lack of hygiene, environmental conditions foster the spread of the disease that, even in the absence of fatal forms, breed significant economic and social costs (absenteeism, immobilization, debilitation and medication) [35] . Dengue is spread only by adult females that require a blood meal for the development of their eggs, whereas male mosquitoes feed on fruit nectar and other sources of sugar. In this process the female acquire the virus while feeding on the blood of an infected person. After virus incubation from eight to twelve days (extrinsic period), an infected mosquito is capable, during probing and blood feeding, of transmitting the virus for the rest of its life to susceptible humans, and the intrinsic period for humans varies from 3 to 15 days.",

In the case of Aedes aegypti, the first three stages take place in or near water whilst air is the medium for the adult stage [103] . Female mosquitoes lay their eggs, but usually do not lay them all at once: it releases them in different places, increasing the probability of new births [139] . The eggs of Aedes aegypti can resist to droughts and low temperatures for up to one year. Although the hatching of mature eggs may occur spontaneously at any time, this is greatly stimulated by flooding. Larvae hatch when water inundates the eggs as a result of rains or an addition of water by people. In the following days, the larvae will feed on microorganisms and particulate organic matter. When the larva has acquired enough energy and size, metamorphosis is done, changing the larva into pupa. Pupae do not feed: they just change in form until the adult body is formed. The newly formed adult emerges from the water after breaking the pupal skin. The entire life cycle, from the aquatic phase (eggs, larvae, pupae) to the adult phase, lasts from 8 to 10 days at room temperature, depending on the level of feeding [27] . The adult stage of the mosquito is considered to last an average of eleven days in an urban environment, reaching up to 30 days in laboratory environment.",

Comparing the general behavior of the solvers one can conclude that the IP based method (Knitro) presents much better performance than the SQP method (Snopt) in terms of the measures used. Regarding the Knitro results, one realizes that the Euler's discretization scheme has better times for h = 0.25 and h = 0.125 and similar time for h = 0.5, when compared to Runge-Kutta's method. Another obvious finding, for both solvers, is that the CPU time increases as far as the problem dimension increases (number of variables and constraints). With respect to the number of iterations, Snopt presents more iterations as the problem dimension increases. However this conclusion cannot be taken for Knitro -in fact, there does not exist a relation between the problem dimension and the number of iterations. The best version tested was Knitro using Runge-Kutta with h = 0.5 (best CPU time and fewer iterations), and the second one was Knitro with Euler's method using h = 0.25. An important evidence of this numerical experience is that it is not worth the reduction of the discretization step size because no significative advantages are obtained.",

Indeed, the obtained control policy in this work presents an important progress with respect to the previous best policy: the percentage of infected mosquitoes vanishes just after four weeks, while mosquitoes are completely eradicated after 30 weeks (Figures 4.4 and 4 .5); the number of infected individuals begin to decrease after four weeks while with the previous policy this only happens after 23 weeks (Figure 4.6) . Despite the fact that our results are better, they are accomplished with a much smaller cost with insecticides and educational campaigns (Figure 4.8) . The general improvement, which explains why the results are so successful, rely on an effective control policy of insecticides. The proposed strategy for insecticide application seems to explain the discrepancies between the results here obtained and the best policy of [20] . Our results show that applying insecticides in the first four weeks yields a substantial reduction in the cost of fighting Dengue, in terms of the functional proposed in [20] . The main conclusion is that health authorities should pay attention to the epidemic from the very beginning: effective control decisions in the first four weeks have a decisive role in the Dengue battle, and population and governments will both profit from it.",

The basic reproduction number has played a central role in the epidemiological theory for Dengue and other infectious diseases because it provides an index of transmission intensity and establishes a threshold criteria. We claim that proper use of control c, can result in the basic reproduction number remaining below unity and, therefore, making BRDFE stable. In order to make effective use of achievable insecticide control, and simultaneously to explain more easily to the competent authorities its effectiveness, we assume that c is constant.

The accelerated increase in mosquito resistance to several chemical insecticides and the damage caused by these to the environment, has resulted in the search for new control alternatives. Among the alternatives available, the use of Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) has been adopted by several countries [89] . Laboratory testing shows that Bti has a high larvicide property and its mechanism of action is based on the production of an endotoxin protein that, when ingested by the larvae, causes death. To ensure the minimization of the outbreaks, educational programmes that are customized for different levels of health care and that reflect local capacity should be supported and implemented widely. People should be instructed to minimize the number of potential places for the mosquito breeding. Educational campaigns can be included as an extra control parameter in the model. This chapter was based on work available in the peer reviewed journal [118] and the peer reviewed conference proceedings [113, 117] .",

Figure 6 .14 presents the number of infected humans. Comparing the optimal control case with a situation with no control, the number of infected people decreased considerably.

Again, as adulticide is the one that has more influence on the model, this is the control that most varies when the weights are changed.

To observe and to act at the epidemics onset could save lives and resources to governments. Moreover, the under-reporting of Dengue cases is probably the most important barrier in obtaining an accurate assessment. A compartmental epidemiological model for Dengue disease composed by a set of differential equations was presented. Simulations based on clean-up campaigns to remove the vector breeding sites, and also simulations on the application of insecticides (larvicide and adulticide), were made. It was shown that even with a low, although continuous, index of control over time, the results are surprisingly positive. The adulticide was the most effective control, since with a low percentage of insecticide, the basic reproduction number is kept below unit and the number infected humans was smaller. However, to bet only in adulticide is a risky decision. In some countries, such as Mexico and Brazil, the prolonged use of adulticides has been increasing the mosquito tolerance capacity to the product or even they become completely resistant. In countries where Dengue is a permanent threat, governments must act with differentiated tools. It will be interesting to analyze these controls in an endemic region and with several outbreaks. We believe that the results will be quite different. Aedes aegypti eradication is not considered to be feasible and, from the environmental point of view, not desirable. The aim is to reduce the mosquito density and, simultaneously, amount the level of immunity on the human population. The increase of population herd immunity can be reached by two ways: increasing the resistant people to the disease implying an increasing of infected individuals or with a vaccination campaign. No commercially available clinical cure or vaccine is currently available for Dengue, but efforts are underway to develop one [10, 68] . The potential of prevention of Dengue by immunization seems to be technically feasible and progress is being made in the development of vaccines that may protect against all four Dengue viruses. In the next chapter, a model of this disease with a vaccine simulation as a new strategy to fight the disease will be analyzed.",

The OC problem was solved using two methods: direct [9, 133] and indirect [81] . The direct method uses the cost functional (7.8) and the state system (7.7) and was solved by DOTcvp [67] . The indirect method used is an iterative method with a Runge-Kutta scheme, solved through ode45 of MatLab. Figure 7 .13 shows the optimal control obtained by both methods. Notice that DOTcvp only gives the optimal control as a constant piecewise function. Table 7 .3 shows the costs obtained by the two methods in both scenarios. The indirect method gives a lower cost. This method uses more mathematical theory about the problem, such as the adjoint system (7.11) and optimal control expression (7.10). Therefore it makes sense that the indirect method produces a better solution. Using the optimal solution as reference, some tests were performed, regarding infected individuals and costs, when no control (u \u2261 0) or upper control (u \u2261 1) is applied. Table 7 .4 shows the results for DOTcvp in the three situations. In both scenarios, using the optimal strategy of vaccination produces better costs with the disease, when compared to not doing anything. Once there is no control, the number of infected humans is higher and produces a more expensive cost functional. Figure 7 .14 shows the number of infected humans when different controls are considered. It is possible to see that using the upper control, which means that everyone is vaccinated, implies that just a few individuals were infected, allowing eradication of the disease. Although the optimal control, in the sense of objective (7.8), allows the occurrence of an outbreak, the number of infected individuals is much lower when compared with a situation where no one is vaccinated.",

When attempting to model epidemics and control for public health applications, there is the compelling urge to make models as sophisticated as possible, including many details about the host and the vector. Although this strategy may be useful when such details are known or exist suitable data, it may lead to a false sense of accuracy when reliable information is not available. Another approach is to keep the model simple and, instead of using the conventional differential calculus, to apply fractional calculus to fit to the disease reality [107] or to use the general theory of time scales [15] .",
