Over 60% of emerging infections are caused by zoonotic pathogens, and approximately 72% of those are caused by pathogens derived from wildlife (Jones et al., 2008). Contributing factors are often associated with human activity, resulting in increased human exposure to animal pathogens ( http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/emerging/pages/introduction.aspx). For example, changes in human demographics and behaviour caused outbreaks of Chikungunya virus infection in Tanzania in 1952, poliomyelitis in India in 2003 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China in 2002, while changes in the land use and agricultural industry caused outbreaks of plague in the United States in 1970, European tick\u2010borne encephalitis in Norway and Far Eastern tick\u2010borne encephalitis in Japan in 1993, Nipah virus infection in Malaysia in 1998 and Rift Valley fever in Egypt in 1977 (Jones et al., 2008). Furthermore, the excessive use of antimicrobial agents contributes to the development of drug\u2010resistant strains of pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Plasmodium falciparum. In addition to human activity, natural genetic variation and recombination and adaptation of known pathogens, such as influenza viruses, result in the appearance of new strains with epidemic and pandemic potential.",

The use of microbes and their products as bioweapons has a long history (Hilleman, 2002). Poisoning and faecal contamination of arrows, spears and punji sticks were practised in ancient times. Contamination of water and food supplies, the projection of infected animal or human cadavers into enemy camps and release of infected rats were also employed in later centuries. By the beginning of the 20th century, biological warfare had acquired a scientific basis. For example, based on the discoveries in microbiology by Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur, Germany infected livestock and animal feed supplies during the World War I. Substantial biological warfare research on crop, animal and human pathogens and toxins was conducted by countries including Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, the United States and the USSR during and after World War II. Due to the adoption of the international Biological Weapons Convention in 1972, which entered into force in 1975 ( http://www.opbw.org/convention/documents/btwctext.pdf), the development, production and stockpiling of bacteriological and toxin\u2010based weapons were prohibited (Christopher et al., 1997). However, these efforts have not completely stopped biological warfare development. For example, in 1975, Iraq began an extensive programme that pursued production of weaponized Bacillus anthracis, Clostridium perfringens, wheat rust and toxins, and development of delivery systems for these bioweapons (Hilleman, 2002). Therefore, there remains a threat that bioterrorist groups can use these pathogens for attacks against civilians. Indeed, after the series of postal mailings containing B. anthracis spores in the United States (Jernigan et al., 2001), the risk of bioterrorism has remained high, promoting significant efforts towards the development of diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic measures for biodefence ( http://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/whoWeAre/Documents/niaidstrategicplan2008.pdf).",

Target populations for these vaccines vary, from general populations in case of seasonal influenza to populations living in or travelling to endemic areas in case of yellow fever to individuals at high risk of exposure such as the military personnel. The majority of approved vaccines against infectious diseases are based on live attenuated or killed whole pathogens. Despite demonstrated protective efficacy, most of them have limitations. Safety is the major issue with these vaccines. For example, BioThrax\u00ae, the vaccine against anthrax, is based on protective antigen (PA) of B. anthracis, but may also contain other components of the bacterium, such as lethal factor (LF) and oedema factor (EF). Therefore, the composition of BioThrax\u00ae is not fully defined and varies from lot to lot. Because of the presence of LF and EF, the vaccine may cause severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis (Emergent BioSolutions, 2012). In addition, to induce protective immunity, BioThrax\u00ae should be administered in as many as five doses over a period of 18 months and at 1\u2010year intervals thereafter (Emergent BioSolutions, 2012).",

Serological analysis demonstrated that the H5 VLP vaccine did not significantly increase the levels of naturally occurring serum IgG against plant\u2010specific glycans. Furthermore, no subjects in the study had a detectable IgE response to plant glycans before or after vaccination. The authors suggest that terminal GlcNAc could have shielded the proximal \u03b1\u20101,3\u2010fucose and \u03b2\u20101,2\u2010xylose residues, preventing IgE cross\u2010linking and mast cell/basophil degranulation (Landry et al., 2010).

Transgenic plants produce recombinant proteins with high efficiency but require relatively long development times to establish producer lines, and the expression of transgenes may decrease over time due to transcriptional gene silencing (Matzke et al., 2000). Transplastomic plants contain abundant copies of a transgene, but the technology is still limited to relatively few species, and there are limitations on post\u2010translational modification in chloroplasts (Daniell et al., 2009; Verma and Daniell, 2007). The transient expression approach is now the most extensively used and allows for the production of large quantities of target proteins within a short time frame (Rybicki, 2010), a particularly attractive feature in the case of pathogens that may be used for bioweapons and for epidemics. Some recombinant proteins produced in plant systems have reached clinical or advanced preclinical stages of development (reviewed in Yusibov et al., 2011; Yusibov et al.,\n2015).

Anthrax is a zoonotic disease but can occur in humans after exposure to infected animals or animal tissue (Davies, 1982; Van Ness, 1971) or via bioterrorism ( http://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/bioterrorism/index.html; Inglesby et al., 1999; Jernigan et al., 2001). Of three forms of the disease caused by B. anthracis \u2013 cutaneous, gastrointestinal and inhalational \u2013 anthrax caused by inhalation of aerosolized spores is most severe with the highest mortality rates of about 86\u201389% (Brachman et al., 1960) and, therefore, most important in the context of bioterrorism. The principal virulence factor of B. anthracis, 83\u2010kDa PA, forms two exotoxins, lethal toxin (LeTx) and oedema toxin, via binding with LF or EF, respectively, which enter the cytoplasm leading to the cell death (Young and Collier, 2007).

Initially, attempts have been made to produce anthrax subunit vaccine candidates in transgenic plants such as tomato, potato and mustard (Aziz et al., 2002, 2005; Gorantala et al., 2014). For example, full\u2010length PA (PA83) was stably expressed in transgenic tobacco plants and demonstrated a cytotoxic activity similar to native PA in vitro when total soluble protein extracted from the transformed leaves was added to macrophage\u2010like cells in combination with LF (Aziz et al., 2002). Immunogenicity of this vaccine candidate was not evaluated. Subsequently, PA83 was expressed in transgenic tomato plants and, when administered intraperitoneally as total soluble protein extracted from the transgenic tomato leaves, elicited LeTx\u2010neutralizing antibodies in mice. However, the transgene expression levels as well as the titres of antibodies raised were low (Aziz et al., 2005). More recently, an attempt was made to develop a comprehensive orally administered vaccine suitable for both veterinary and human use. For this purpose, PA83 was expressed in transgenic mustard, Brassica juncea, whose leaves and stems can be consumed as a vegetable by humans and used as feed for cattle, although the expression levels and in vitro cytotoxicity of this PA83 varied due to random total soluble protein from transgenic B. juncea, adjuvanted with Alhydrogel or cholera toxin (CT) and generated significant anti\u2010PA IgG titres (Gorantala et al., 2014). Significant serum IgA titres and faecal secretory IgA titres were also detected, indicating the development of mucosal immune responses. Oral immunization with either adjuvanted or nonadjuvanted PA83 from B. juncea conferred 60% survival on mice following lethal intraperitoneal anthrax challenge (Gorantala et al., 2014).",

CTB, a nontoxigenic pentameric subunit of CT, is a highly efficient carrier for mucosal antigen delivery of chemically or genetically coupled antigens and acts via binding to ganglioside GM1 receptors on the surface of intestinal epithelial cells (Holmgren et al., 1993). This facilitates uptake of the ligand\u2013antigen conjugate and stimulates antigen presentation and mucosal immune responses. CTB expressed in transformed tobacco chloroplasts has been confirmed to form pentamers and share the biological activity of native CTB (Daniell et al., 2001).

Using optimized chloroplast protein expression conditions, an increased expression of PA83 compared with nuclear transgenic tobacco plants has been achieved (Aziz et al., 2005). The chloroplast\u2010derived PA protein exhibited a potent cytotoxic effect against a macrophage cell line in vitro in the presence of LF. Similar to PA83 from transgenic B. juncea, chloroplast\u2010derived PA83 generated significant serum anti\u2010PA IgG and IgA titres following oral administration with CT adjuvant, indicating the development of both systemic and mucosal immune responses (Gorantala et al., 2014). Furthermore, orally immunized mice demonstrated 80% survival after lethal anthrax challenge (Gorantala et al., 2014). In addition to full\u2010length PA, its fragment, PA domain 4 (PA[dIV]), has also been expressed in tobacco chloroplasts and the expression levels were found to be significantly higher compared with nuclear transformation (up to 5.3% vs. 0.8% of total soluble protein) (Gorantala et al., 2011). Both intraperitoneal and oral immunizations with total soluble protein from the PA(dIV) transplastomic plants elicited antibody titres of >104, similar to Escherichia coli\u2010derived PA(dIV), which were predominantly of the IgG1 subtype and possessed toxin\u2010neutralizing activity in vitro. In addition, intraperitoneal and oral immunization with chloroplast\u2010derived PA(dIV), adjuvanted with Alhydrogel or CT, respectively, each conferred 60% protection of mice against lethal anthrax challenge, respectively, compared with 100% and 80% protection with adjuvanted E. coli\u2010derived PA(dIV). Further evaluation of mucosal responses following oral immunizations detected low secretory IgA titres in faecal extracts from mice receiving adjuvanted plant\u2010 or E. coli\u2010derived PA(dIV). In addition, anti\u2010PA(dIV) antisera enhanced B. anthracis spore uptake by macrophages in vitro and suppressed spore germination (Gorantala et al., 2011).",

For example, an anthrax subunit vaccine candidate has been designed (Chichester et al., 2007), comprising domain 4 of PA and domain 1 of LF that were separately fused to a carrier, LicKM, modified lichenase from Clostridium thermocellum (Musiychuk et al., 2007). The vaccine was expressed in agroinfiltrated Nicotiana benthamiana plants using a previously described tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)\u2010based hybrid vector (Musiychuk et al., 2007; Shoji et al., 2009). Mice immunized with this dual anthrax vaccine candidate adjuvanted with complete or incomplete Freund's adjuvant developed high titres of anti\u2010PA and anti\u2010LF IgG1 as well as LeTx\u2010neutralizing antibodies (Chichester et al., 2007). Using the same expression system, a single\u2010component anthrax vaccine candidate was subsequently produced in N. benthamiana plants, comprising nonfused, full\u2010length, glycosylated, recombinant PA83 (Chichester et al., 2013). This new vaccine elicited high titres of toxin\u2010neutralizing antibodies in mice and rabbits after two administrations in the presence of Alhydrogel. Furthermore, rabbits that received the adjuvanted PA83 were completely protected from a lethal aerosolized B. anthracis challenge. The vaccine antigen formulated with Alhydrogel was found to be stable and retained immunogenicity after 2\u2010week storage at 4 \u00b0C, which is suitable for clinical use. Safety and immunogenicity of the plant\u2010produced PA83 in healthy adults aged 18\u201349 years are currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial (NCT02239172) ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02239172?term=pa83&rank=1), in which immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate is being assessed as changes in serum antibody titres from baseline after three intramuscular immunizations at four dose levels in the presence of Alhydrogel.",

Numerous data suggest that Y. pestis recently evolved from the enteric bacterium Yersinia pseudotuberculosis that adapted to an insect vector (the flea) and transmission between mammalian hosts via subcutaneous and pneumonic routes. A common route of bacterial transmission from animal to animal is by the bite of an infected flea. After the flea ingests blood containing Y. pestis from a rodent host, the bacterium multiplies in the flea gut, resulting in blood clotting in the proventriculus and blocking the food (blood) passage from the oesophagus to the midgut. During feeding, the blocked flea regurgitates infected blood into the bloodstream of the mammal, transmitting the bacterium to the next host (Prentice and Rahalison, 2007). Transmission of the pathogen to humans may occur through the flea bite, contact with fluids from an infected animal or aspiration of respiratory droplets from an infected animal or an individual with pneumonic lesions. Depending on how the bacterium enters the body, plague can manifest in three clinical forms, bubonic (the most common form of naturally occurring plague), septicaemic or pneumonic, with pneumonic plague being the most virulent and fatal form of the disease (Cobbs and Chansolme, 2004; Inglesby et al., 2000; Perry and Fetherston, 1997; http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/plague). A formalin\u2010killed whole\u2010cell Y. pestis vaccine against plague was the only plague vaccine licensed in the United States, but it was not effective against pneumonic plague and its manufacture was discontinued in 1999 (Titball and Williamson, 2004).",

Fusion protein (F1\u2013LcrV)\u2010based orally administered plague subunit vaccine candidates have been produced by generating F1\u2013LcrV transgenic plants such as tomato (Alvarez et al., 2006), lettuce (Rosales\u2010Mendoza et al., 2010) and carrot tap root (Rosales\u2010Mendoza et al., 2011), and their immunogenicity following either oral or subcutaneous administration has been evaluated. For example, mice were subcutaneously primed with bacteria\u2010produced F1\u2013LcrV and then orally boosted with several doses of freeze\u2010dried F1\u2013LcrV transgenic tomato fruits along with bacterial CT as an adjuvant.

The authors explained the observed medium level of mouse protection by the extended time interval allowed between the last vaccine boost and the bacterial challenge (18 months), which, according to a previous report (Fujihashi et al., 2000), may have resulted in a reduced ability of these aged mice to elicit systemic and mucosal antigen\u2010specific immune responses. On the other hand, the results indicate that protection against Y. pestis was maintained over long term. The level of target accumulation originally obtained in the freeze\u2010dried transgenic tomato tissue was high (4\u201310% total soluble protein) (Alvarez et al., 2006); however, it was subsequently increased (up to 16% total soluble protein) by means of P19\u2010induced suppression of RNA\u2010mediated target gene silencing (Alvarez et al., 2008).",

Contamination of purified pB5 with increased amounts of total soluble protein from wild\u2010type tobacco plants decreased B5\u2010specific antibody responses, especially those induced by intranasal immunization, and shifted them towards the Th2 type. Taken together, these data indicate the importance of antigen dose and purity for efficient intranasal vaccination (Portocarrero et al., 2008).",

Most current investigational therapies against Ebola target the major virulence factor of Ebola virus (EBOV), GP, the transmembrane molecule that mediates virus host cell entry and cytopathic viral effects within the cell (Lee et al., 2008; Simmons et al., 2002) and induces protective antibodies (Wilson et al., 2000). So far, an antibody\u2010based therapy is the most advanced Ebola treatment option. A monoclonal antibody cocktail, MB\u2010003, consisting of human and human\u2013mouse chimeric monoclonal antibodies c13C6, h13F6 and c6D8 (the latter two virus neutralizing), was produced by Mapp Biophamaceutical, Inc. (San Diego, CA) in the glycoengineered N. benthamiana line \u2206XTFT, an RNAi\u2010based double knockout glycosylation mutant lacking plant\u2010specific N\u2010linked xylose and core fucose residues (Strasser et al., 2008; Zeitlin et al., 2011), using Magnifection (Gleba et al., 2005). When MB\u2010003 was administered to rhesus macaques intravenously 1 h postinfection, followed by two additional doses on days 4 and 8, all three treated monkeys were protected against intramuscular lethal challenge with EBOV. Furthermore, MB\u2010003 was partially protective (four of six monkeys) if the treatment was given 24 or 48 h postinfection, whereas no monkeys survived in the untreated group. In addition, plant\u2010produced MB\u2010003 was three times as potent as the Chinese hamster ovary cell\u2010produced recombinant counterpart monoclonal antibodies (Olinger et al., 2012). The difference is suggested to be due to the absence of the core fucose on the Fc region of the plant\u2010derived monoclonal antibodies leading to increased antibody binding to the Fc receptor gamma RIII and enhanced antibody\u2010dependent cellular cytotoxicity compared with monoclonal antibodies produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells (Zeitlin et al., 2011). Based on these results, the authors suggest that antibody\u2010dependent cellular cytotoxicity plays a critical role in the protective efficacy conferred by MB\u2010003 (Olinger et al., 2012).",

This recombinant immune fusion complex is based on an anti\u2010Ebola IgG antibody carrying fused GP1 (Phoolcharoen et al., 2011). In a previous study, plant\u2010produced tetanus toxin fragment C\u2013IgG immune complexes were described and reported to bind to the complement factor C1q and Fc receptor gamma RIIa and to be targeted to antigen\u2010presenting cells. These immune complexes, injected subcutaneously without adjuvant, are very highly immunogenic and fully protective in mice, comparable with the commercial antigen adjuvanted with alum. In contrast, plant\u2010produced nonadjuvanted antigen did not induce protective immunity (Chargelegue et al., 2005). To produce Ebola immune complexes, a heavy chain (Hc) and light chain (Lc) of the humanized 6D8 IgG monoclonal antibody directed against a linear epitope on Ebola GP1, with the GP1 subunit genetically fused to the C\u2010terminus of the 6D8 monoclonal antibody Hc, were transiently co\u2010expressed in N. benthamiana plants (Phoolcharoen et al., 2011), using the previously developed bean yellow dwarf virus\u2010based geminiviral replicon system (Huang et al., 2010). Due to the interaction between the 6D8 epitopes and 6D8 binding sites, the recombinant Hc and Lc assembled into a full\u2010size chimeric IgG that formed immune complexes in planta, capable of binding C1q. In mice, subcutaneous immunization with four doses of these purified Ebola immune complexes, without adjuvant, elicited anti\u2010Ebola virus antibody production at levels comparable to those obtained with the positive control, GP1 VLPs (Phoolcharoen et al., 2011), based on recombinant RNA replicons derived from an attenuated strain of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (Pushko et al., 2000). In the follow\u2010up study, the authors observed that administration of the Ebola immune complexes along with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid, a Toll\u2010like receptor 3 agonist, as an adjuvant, elicited a more robust antibody response in mice compared with the immune complexes alone. Furthermore, these vaccine\u2010induced antibodies protected 80% of vaccinated mice against lethal challenge with live mouse\u2010adapted Ebola virus, which correlated with mixed Th1/Th2 humoral responses to the antigen (Phoolcharoen et al., 2011). Overall, the results suggest the strong potential of the Ebola immune complexes as vaccine candidates against Ebola.",

Several studies reported on production of E protein\u2010based subunit vaccines against dengue fever.

Recently, DIII has been transiently produced in N. benthamiana plants using Magnifection (Gleba et al., 2005), with maximum accumulation detected at 4 days postinfiltration (He et al., 2014b). Of subcellular localizations tested for DIII expression (the cytosol, ER and chloroplasts), target accumulation was highest in the ER (~73 mg/kg of fresh leaf tissue).

Subcutaneous immunization of mice with four doses of alum\u2010adjuvanted purified DIII elicited potent antigen\u2010specific serum IgG titres that bound to the native form of the viral DIII antigen and were exclusively of the IgG1 isotype, indicating a Th2\u2010type immune response (He et al., 2014b).

Inclusion of domains DI and DII significantly reduced leaf necrosis and increased recombinant protein accumulation to ~600 mg/kg of fresh leaf tissue. Immunization of mice with this full\u2010size E protein, in the presence of alum, elicited robust neutralizing antibody responses, specific for both the E protein and DIII, and induced cytokine release. Both IgG and cytokines were predominantly of the Th2 type (Chen, 2015).",

From 1976 to 2007 in the United States, the estimated annual average of influenza\u2010associated deaths, resulting from respiratory and circulatory causes, including pneumonia and influenza, was about 23 600 (ranging from 3349 to 48 614), which corresponds to a range of 1.4\u201316.7 deaths per 100 000 persons (CDC, 2010). During annual epidemics, 3\u20135 million cases of severe influenza illness are recorded worldwide, resulting in 250 000\u2013500 000 deaths ( http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs211/en/index.html). In addition to seasonal influenza outbreaks, occasional influenza pandemics can arise at any time when an influenza A virus containing a novel HA subtype emerges and spreads efficiently among humans. In 2009, a novel influenza A H1N1 virus of swine origin [A(H1N1)pdm09] emerged and infected humans. The virus, a triple reassortant with genes acquired from swine, avian and human influenza viruses (Garten et al., 2009), was first detected in people in the United States in April 2009 (Novel Swine\u2010Origin Influenza A (H1N1) Virus Investigation Team et al.,\n2009) and spread rapidly across the globe, primarily in children and young adult populations with little pre\u2010existing serologic immunity to the novel HA (Hancock et al., 2009), causing the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic on 11 June 2009 ( http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2009/h1n1_pandemic_phase6_20090611/en/). Nearly 30 000 confirmed cases in 74 countries were reported. Of those, about 2% developed severe illness, often with very rapid progression to life\u2010threatening pneumonia, although the number of deaths was small ( http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2009/h1n1_pandemic_phase6_20090611/en/). Furthermore, a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A (H5N1) virus that spread rapidly from 2004 onwards and caused serious poultry outbreaks in several Asian countries, Europe and Africa is also able to infect humans. Among more than 500 individuals who have been infected with H5N1 viruses, the mortality rate is 50\u201360% ( http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/index.htm; http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/avian_influenza/en/; http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/H5N1_cumulative_table_archives/en/). Although almost all reported human cases have had close contact with infected birds, with very rare instances of presumed human to human transmission, considerable concern for human health remains, not only because of the severity of human cases, but also because the virus could undergo adaptive mutation or reassortment and obtain the ability to spread efficiently among humans ( http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/index.htm; http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/avian_influenza/en/; http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/H5N1_cumulative_table_archives/en/).

Traditionally, influenza vaccines are manufactured by propagating influenza viruses in embryonated hens' eggs. Because of continued changes in the multiple circulating epidemic strains of influenza viruses and a lack of pre\u2010existing immunity to emerging viruses, manufacturing of new upgraded vaccines is required on an annual basis. HA, the most abundant surface glycoprotein of influenza virus, responsible for binding to cell surface receptors and internalization of the virus, plays a key role in virus infectivity and pathogenesis (Skehel and Wiley, 2000; Wilson et al., 1981). It is well recognized that protection provided by influenza vaccines is mediated primarily by anti\u2010HA highly neutralizing antibodies (Han and Marasco, 2011), making HA the major target for influenza subunit vaccine development (Athmaram et al., 2011; Cox, 2008; Mischler and Metcalfe, 2002; Wu et al., 2010). Anti\u2010HA antibodies can inhibit the hemagglutination activity of HA, and this hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) is used as a correlate of protection for the evaluation and licensing of influenza vaccines (US FDA, 2007).",

These challenges would potentially be overwhelming during a pandemic.

For example, griffithsin, the 12.7\u2010kDa lectin from the red algae Griffithsia sp. with an antiviral activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), binds terminal mannose residues of N\u2010linked glycans on the surface of the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 and blocks virus entry into host cells (Mori et al., 2005). Due to its structure (the presence of carbohydrate recognition domains and formation of domain\u2010swapped dimers) (Zi\u00f3\u0142kowska et al., 2006), griffithsin may have a broader activity and inhibit other enveloped viruses that display similar glycan structures. For example, recombinant bacteria\u2010derived griffithsin has been shown to be active against JEV in vitro and in vivo, completely protecting mice against lethal viral challenge (Ishag et al., 2013). The potential of griffithsin is further supported by its successful production in N. benthamiana using TMV\u2010based transient expression approach, with a yield of 300 mg/kg of fresh biomass, and recovered at a purity of >99% (O'Keefe et al., 2009). The plant\u2010produced griffithsin exhibited antiviral activity against a broad spectrum of coronaviruses, including SARS\u2010CoV, via specific binding to the SARS\u2010CoV spike glycoprotein (S protein) (O'Keefe et al., 2009). The efficacy of griffithsin was demonstrated using a lethal mouse model of pulmonary infection, where intranasal treatment with griffithsin protected animals against SARS infection. Mechanisms of CoV disease pathogenesis are believed to involve excessive and dysregulated cytokine/chemokine responses by pro\u2010inflammatory cells (Perlman and Dandekar, 2005). The results of the current study support this hypothesis: treatment with griffithsin significantly reduced the production of several cytokines in mouse lung tissue, including IL\u20101\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20106, G\u2010CSF, MCP\u20101 and IL\u201012(p40), by 4 days postinfection, compared results with untreated infected mice (O'Keefe et al., 2010).",

A version of a plant\u2010produced recombinant fusion of actinohivin to the Fc portion of a human monoclonal antibody was recently reported to exhibit nanomolar antiviral activity against HIV as well as other enveloped viruses, including influenza virus, hepatitis C virus, Ebola virus and SARS\u2010CoV, suggesting both clinical and diagnostic applications for this hybrid polypeptide (Matoba, 2014).",

Using this system, the 45\u2010kDa C\u2010terminal half of the Hc of botulinum type A neurotoxin (BoHc) was expressed in rice at an average of 0.1 mg per seed (Yuki et al., 2012). The target, MucoRice\u2010BoHc, is water soluble and accumulated in the cytoplasm but not in protein bodies I or II of rice seeds. Mucosal (intranasal) immunization of mice with MucoRice\u2010BoHc conferred protection against a lethal challenge with botulinum type A neurotoxin. When MucoRice\u2010BoHc was intranasally administered in the presence of CT or a nontoxic chimeric adjuvant mCTA/LTB (a combination of the A subunit of mutant CT E112K and the pentameric B subunit of heat\u2010labile enterotoxin from enterotoxigenic E. coli), high levels of antigen\u2010specific serum IgG and nasal IgA responses were induced and all the immunized mice survived the challenge (Yuki et al., 2012).",

In mice, intramuscular immunization with RiVax protected against challenge with ricin delivered by gavage or inhalation (Smallshaw et al., 2007).

In vitro, using a Vero cell\u2010based cytotoxicity assay, murine hybridoma\u2010produced GD12 was shown to bind ricin holotoxin with high affinity (dissociation constant of 2.9 \u00d7 10\u22129 m) and neutralize it with a 50% inhibitory concentration of ~0.25 \u03bcg/mL. In vivo, passive administration of GD12, by intraperitoneal injection or via the \u2018backpack tumour\u2019, protected mice against systemic (intraperitoneal) and mucosal (intragastric) ricin challenge, respectively (Neal et al., 2010). Based on the properties of the murine GD12 monoclonal antibody, an engineered version of this monoclonal antibody was produced in plants. The plant\u2010derived version was a chimeric derivative of GD12 (cGD12), in which the murine Hc and Lc variable regions were fused to a human IgG1 framework, which was engineered and transiently expressed in N. benthamiana (O'Hara et al., 2012). Plant\u2010produced cGD12 demonstrated epitope specificity and ricin neutralizing activity similar to those of the native murine monoclonal antibody. Passive administration of cGD12 by intraperitoneal injection protected mice against a systemic ricin challenge. To assess the efficacy of this monoclonal antibody postricin exposure, GD12 and cGD12 were administered 6 h after toxin challenge and shown to rescue mice from toxin\u2010induced death. Thus, plant\u2010produced cGD12 has potential as both a prophylactic and a therapeutic treatment against ricin intoxication.",

However, there is increasing momentum to advance lead plant\u2010based candidates into the clinic, and in recent years, the regulatory and commercial landscape has started changing in favour of plant\u2010derived subunit vaccines, monoclonal antibodies and other therapeutic proteins for human use, exemplified by the licensing and commercial release of taliglucerase alfa. However, to approve and commercialize a plant\u2010produced candidate, regulatory authorities consider not only its safety and efficacy, but also its additional factors, including the effective dose, the number of required doses and product stability during storage. In addition, while some subunit vaccines require an adjuvant, others, such as virus\u2010like particles, may be efficacious alone. These factors would reflect the ultimate product cost. With regard to product stability, subunit vaccines or therapeutic proteins delivered via oral route may undergo rapid degradation in the gastrointestinal tract, which stresses the need for protective formulation.",
