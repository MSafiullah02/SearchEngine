Parvoviruses are therefore, a group of relatively small viruses with linear, single stranded DNA (ssDNA) genomes ranging from 4 to 6.3 kilobases (kb) in size, packaged in a non-enveloped, icosahedral capsid (Tijssen et al., 2011). They are ubiquitous in nature and common infectious agents of numerous hosts ranging from non-vertebrate arthropods to vertebrates and higher mammals including human beings. Their ancestors, according to Kailasan et al. (2015), seem to have emerged several millions of years ago and have been widely distributed ever since. Although parvoviruses appear to have evolved from the same ancestor and have similar genomic features, they usually exhibit a very low relatedness at the nucleotide or protein level thereby depicting their highly extensive diversity. Their diversity seems to also influence the clinical effects exerted on their hosts which could range from non-pathogenic infections to severely lethal diseases' manifestations (Kailasan et al., 2015).",

The group of parvoviruses that infect invertebrate hosts (arthropods and crustaceans) belong to the subfamily Densovirinae, whereas those that infect vertebrate hosts belong to the subfamily Parvovirinae. In the ninth edition of the taxonomical grouping that was made by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), the subfamily Densovirinae consists of four genera namely: Densovirus, Brevidensovirus, Iteravirus and Pefudensovirus; whereas the subfamily Parvovirinae comprises five genera: Parvovirus, Erythrovirus, Dependovirus, Amdovirus and Bocavirus (Tijssen et al., 2011). However, in the latest ICTV report, series of systematic changes were made using a modified definition for classification that requires complete or nearly complete genome of the viruses to arrive at an improved taxonomic clarity of parvoviruses, and this gave rise to the introduction of new species and genera into the two subfamilies of the family Parvoviridae (Cotmore et al., 2014).",

Also, the later part of this review will bring to the fore the epidemiology of the porcine parvoviruses in swine herds of African countries taking cognizance of the past, present and future. This becomes highly imperative as the region is observed to be moving at a relatively low pace in the use of new technologies for the detection of infectious agents; this abnormal trend could undermine the global efforts in prevention and control of myriads of emerging and re-emerging animal and human diseases that are ravaging our world.",

Many data from previous studies on the determination of major etiologic agents of reproductive failure in swine have shown PPV as important cause of porcine foetal death. Mengeling et al. (1991) earlier implicated PPV1 in the death of about 35% (105 of 302) of dead foetuses collected and tested in the USA. In some relatively recent studies, Zhang et al. (2010) found out only PPV1 as the causal agent of an acute outbreak of abortions in a domesticated herd of 500 wild boar females in Heilongjiang province, China; while, Tummaruk and Tantilertcharoen (2012) observed that 86% (143/166) of gilts culled due to reproductive failure in Thai swine herds were seropositive for PPV1.

The genome has a unique feature of distinct palindromic hairpin termini and contains two major open reading frames (ORFs) (Bergeron et al., 1993; Bergeron et al., 1996). The ORF1 found at the 5\u2032 end of the viral genome codes for non-structural proteins 1 (NS1) which could be spliced alternatively to obtain two additional non-structural proteins (NS2 and NS3). The non-structural proteins have some enzymatic functions that are important in the viral replication and packaging (Bergeron et al., 1996). The ORF2 which codes for capsid proteins (VP1, 2 and 3) is located at the 3\u2032 end of the viral genome. The VP1 and 2 proteins are formed from differently spliced mRNAs, while VP3 is formed by proteolytic cutting of VP2 (Bergeron et al., 1996). About sixty copies of the capsid proteins are used in the assembly of the virus' icosahedral capsid, as previously reviewed by Streck et al. (2015a).",

It is highly thermo-stable, having the ability to survive dry heat to an extent of 90 \u00b0C (Eterpi et al., 2009). Furthermore, the virus can resist up to 70% ethanol and disinfectants like sodium hypochlorite at a low concentration of 2500 ppm. Hence, the viral pathogens can remain infectious in a contaminated pen, farm tools and clothings for months thereby enhancing its transmission from one farm to another (Truyen and Streck, 2012). That is the reason why strict observation of biosecurity measures are necessary in piggery operations, so as to prevent the farm to farm spread of the pathogens and other related ones. Farm to farm transmission can also be enhanced through gilt replacement when asymptomatic gilts are acquired. This is because infected pigs may not necessarily show any clinical manifestation if well vaccinated (Truyen and Streck, 2012; Foerster et al., 2016). The virus can also be introduced into a vulnerable farm when an infected boar or sperm is used for breeding purposes; a seronegative boar can also be infected during mating from vaginal mucus of an infected sow (Szelei et al., 2006). Furthermore, the viral pathogen can spread within a herd through faecal droppings, nasal and oral secretions from infected pigs (Truyen and Streck, 2012).",

While the former is known to be virulent variant, the later is non-pathogenic and generally employed in producing the inactivated and modified live vaccines (Paul and Mengeling, 1984; Mengeling et al., 1984; Bergeron et al., 1996; Simpson et al., 2002). Although the avirulent PPV-NADL2 has a history of causing limited viraemia without crossing the placenta barrier (Mengeling et al., 1984), the PPV-Kresse is exceptionally pathogenic, having a strange capacity to cause mortality not only in a susceptible foetuses, but also in the immuno-competent ones in cases of maternal infections (Zeeuw et al., 2007) and induce dermatitis in immuno-competent foetuses and young pigs (Choi et al., 1987; Whitaker et al., 1990; Lager and Mengeling, 1994).",

When a seronegative pregnant sow is infected at the early stage of gestation, its conceptus is usually not affected due to an initial protection received (Mengeling et al., 2000). However, during the embryonic stage, occurrence of PPV1 infection normally results to transplacental infections of the embryo leading to embryonic death and resorption. At a gestation period of 35 days and above when bone formation begins, the viral infection gives rise to foetal death and mummification. Finally, if a pregnant sow is infected at the advanced stage of gestation of 70 days and above, its foetus has already become immuno-competent at that point; hence, the foetus can independently resist the viral infection and becomes seropositive at birth with likelihood of having a subclinical infection status (Lenghaus et al., 1978; Mengeling et al., 2000; Zeeuw et al., 2007).",

However, reproductive system operation failure due to PPV1 infection is usually prevented through vaccination of the gilts prior to insemination and this has proven effective and economical over the years for successful farm operations (Wrathall et al., 1984; Pye et al., 1990; Mengeling et al., 1991; Parke and Burgess, 1993). The recorded success, however, has been a function of effective vaccination regimes in terms of timing and consistency (Truyen and Streck, 2012). Firstly, it has been shown that a trans-placental passage of maternal antibodies does not occur in pigs (Salmon et al., 2009); hence, a surviving piglet is expected to obtain antibodies from its mother against PPV1 through colostrum intake at its early stage of life (Devillers et al., 2011). However, the depletion of the maternally acquired antibodies is a normal phenomenon that determines when vaccination of pigs can be carried out in order for it to be effective as vaccination at a high level of maternal antibodies brings about negative interference (Truyen and Streck, 2012). An appropriate timing has been recently determined to be after three months of age for a gilt to be inseminated prior to five or six months old (Gava et al., 2017).",

However, it has been proven experimentally that both homologous and heterologous inactivated PPV1 vaccines can not prevent viral infection and shedding, thereby making total immunization and subsequent eradication of the virus impossible. This, therefore, necessitates the need for a consistent follow-up vaccinations of all breeders appropriately (J\u00f3\u017awik et al., 2009; Foerster et al., 2016). This limitation, coupled with seeming emergence of new strains of PPV1 that show lower homology with the vaccine strains, therefore necessitates futher development of more efficient vaccines (J\u00f3\u017awik et al., 2009; Ren et al., 2013; Streck et al., 2015a).",

            "text": "The PPV3, also referred to as porcine hokovirus (PHoV), belongs to the Ungulate tetraparvovirus 2 species and it is presently grouped together with PPV2 in the genus Tetraparvovirus, one of the two genera that comprise human and pig pathogens together under the subfamily Parvovirinae. The virus was also accidentally detected together with bovine parvoviruses (BHoV) in Hong Kong when an effort to determine the relationship that exists between the newly identified human parvovirus types 4 and 5 (PARVs 4 and 5) and animal parvoviruses was made. Although the PHoV and BHoV show a genetic similarity to the human parvovirus types 4 and 5, however according to Lau et al. (2008), the risk of the animal hokoviruses to human health is not likely to be significant since the viruses were absent in human samples examined in the study. Nevertheless, they further asserted that there is possibility of further mutation and/or recombination in the viral strains, leading to overcoming the interspecies barrier as previously observed in many emerging infectious zoonotic diseases that cause epidemics in humans; such like the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that was responsible for the SARS epidemic in 2003, which originated from wild animals (Lau et al., 2008). The virus is believed to have a global distribution status as it has been found in domestic pigs in Asia (Pan et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013; Saekhow and Ikeda, 2015), North America (Xiao et al., 2012), Europe (Cs\u00e1gola et al., 2012) and Africa (Adlhoch et al., 2013). It has also been found in wild boars in Germany and Romania with prevalence of 33% and 50% respectively (Adlhoch et al., 2010; Cadar et al., 2011).",

Although the virus was initially detected from samples obtained from pigs with multiple clinical manifestations including PRRS and PCV2-associated diseases, the involvement of the viral pathogen in the observed disease conditions is yet to be resolved (Cheung et al., 2010; Saekhow and Ikeda, 2015). Phylogenetically, PPV4 has a closer relationship with bovine parvovirus 2 (BPV2). However, in terms of genomic organization and structure, the virus is quite similar to other porcine viruses under the genus Bocavirus due to its possession of an additional ORF3 gene situated at the center of its genome. The deduced amino acids of the PPV4 ORF3 gene are however quite different from those of bocaviruses (Cheung et al., 2010). This is suggested to be the basis of its separate clustering outside the bocavirus group. The virus is presently assigned to the genus Copiparvovirus together with BPV2 in the ICTV latest report (Cotmore et al., 2014).",

Partial genome (1879 bp) that comprises the entire NP1 and partial VP1/VP2 of the Swedish porcine boca-like virus (PBo-likeV) was amplified and analyzed alongside with the genomes of Torque Teno virus (TTV) and PCV2, thereby confirming the presence of the viruses in the PCV2-associated wasting syndrome case, although the contribution of PBo-likeV to the development of PMWS is yet to be elucidated (Blomstr\u00f6m et al., 2009).",

Subsequently, the virus was detected as the etiologic agent of similar clinical feature at some other farms. This prompted Prozesky et al. (1980) to launch a pathological investigation on the isolated local strain of PPV1, so as to elucidate its effect on foetuses and pregnant sows for the purpose of comparing their findings with other documented cases. Experimental reproduction of typical PPV1-associated reproductive failure characterized by resorption, abortion and mummification of foetuses was successfully carried out through the in-utero inoculation of 15 sows at different levels of gestation with the local viral strain. Vascular lesions were equally observed in the endometrium of the sows, which the authors assumed could contribute to the reproductive disorders observed in the inoculated sows (Prozesky et al., 1980).",

Further analysis of the contig sequences to determine the individual virus present in the samples showed the presence of astroviruses in 10 out of the 12 samples (83.3%), followed by porcine bocaviruses which was detected in 7 out of the 12 samples, representing 58.3%. Subsequently, a commendable effort was made by the authors to sequence the full genomes of the two porcine bocavirus strains JOA_011 and JOA_015 obtained from healthy pigs in farms from the two countries. The two sequences were further analyzed and showed high relatedness with the strain KU14 from South Korea (Amimo et al., 2017). It is expected that future large scale epidemiological studies that will unravel the presence and prevalence of the viral pathogens in pigs from the region will be conducted, considering the fact that two (PPV4 and PBoV) out of the numerous members of the viral group have already been found in the reported studies (Blomstr\u00f6m et al., 2012, Blomstr\u00f6m et al., 2013; Amimo et al., 2017).",

(2013) in a separate study also reported the occurrence, diversity and prevalence of some DNA viruses including those of the Parvoviridae family in Cameroonian pigs. While other viral groups were absent in the samples from the asymptomatic pigs, some porcine parvoviruses in the subfamily Parvovirinae were detected including PPV4 with prevalence of 10/50 (20%). Others are bocaviruses including PBoV1/2 with the prevalence of 3/50 (6%), 9/50 (18%) for PBoV3, 9/50 (18%) for PBoV4 and 8/50 (16%) for the combination of PBoV5 and PBoV6V/7 V (Ndze et al., 2013). High co-infection rates between PPV4 and the various species of bocaviruses were equally noted in the study. Future efforts are required to amplify and sequence the complete genomes of the detected PBoVs for an adequate genetic characterization of the viral strains in circulation within the country.",

(2013) used 282 samples collected in the year 2012 for the purpose of investigating the presence of hepatitis E virus (HEV) in Cameroonian pigs to screen for the presence of porcine hokovirus (PPV3), a related virus to human parvovirus 4 (PARV4), in the swine herds of the country. The DNA samples obtained were pooled, with each pool containing 3 different samples. From a total of 94 pooled samples, 69% (65/94) samples from Doula, Yaound\u00e9, and Bamenda districts of Cameroon were positive for PHoV. Subsequently, effort was made to determine the prevalence based on the individual samples apart from the one obtained for the pooled samples, however, 12 samples were reported missing by the authors and no reason was given to that effect. Hence, a general prevalence of 47% (128/270) was estimated from the remaining individual samples obtained from the Cameroonian pigs. Phylogenetic analysis was subsequently performed on the partial genomes generated from some of the pooled samples and the Cameroonian sequences had close homology of 98\u201399% to other reference sequences from the Europe, USA and China. The authors, however, suggested further studies on the virus at other premises of Africa in order to determine the circulating viral strains in the region (Adlhoch et al., 2013).",

Although the classical porcine parvovirus has been the most studied member of the viral group globally, efforts in various parts of the world in detecting and analyzing the prevalence of other novel porcine parvoviruses is highly commendable compared to a lethargic approach that is being used in the African region. Considering the economic importance of parvoviruses to the piggery business as highlighted in this review, most especially the continuous emergence of new strains/species with presumed zoonotic potentials due to their relatively close genetic relatedness with human parvoviruses, the need for effective large-scale surveillance and characterization of the porcine parvoviruses and many other neglected swine pathogens in the region becomes imperative. This will go a long way in enhancing the implementation of the globally acclaimed \u201cOne Health, One World\u201d initiative for combating zoonotic diseases in the region.",
