            "text": "Drug discovery is distressed. The number of approved new molecular entities has declined steadily for 15 years [1], the cost per new approved compound has breached the one billion United States Dollar (USD) benchmark [2] and, by one informed estimate, the financial return provided by all therapeutic product categories does not even recover the capital costs of their development. Moreover, when biologics are removed from this model, the net present value of pharmaceutical Research and Development (R&D) investment is actually negative [3]. Disturbingly, poor research performance occurs in the context of increasing social need. The rising incidence of drug resistant bacteria is well documented [4], viral pathogens such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Dengue and H1N1 pose pandemic threats [5], and an aging and more affluent global population drives up the prevalence of chronic diseases that are if anything more difficult than infectious diseases to drug. In the United States, where by 2023 the Census Bureau projects \u223c15% of males and \u223c19% of females will be 65 years old or older, rates of cancer are expected to rise from 33% to 62%, of diabetes from 33% to 53%, of cardiovascular complaints from 6% to 39%, of mental disorders from 35% to 54%, for a total increase in chronic morbidity in the U.S. population from 17% to 42% [6]. An increase in successful drug discovery, especially against difficult chronic targets, is clearly desirable. However, progress must materialize in the framework of reduced per compound cost and enhanced efficiency, since capital will not continue to flow into a sector that offers net negative returns. Computational or \u2018virtual\u2019 drug discovery strategies, potentially cheaper and faster, offer attractive alternative, or at least complimentary, routes to improved R&D performance in the therapeutics sector [7].",

Although these models are complex (and in the quantum case inherently non-exact), researchers active in the computer intensive field of molecular graphics realized thirty years ago that in silico assessment of drug-receptor binding could be deployed to accelerate drug discovery [9, 10]. They also realized that continuing operation of Moore's Law, with 18 month doublings in computing efficiency and economy, implied an on-going improvement and refinement in computational techniques. The crux of the computational drug discovery paradigm is this coupling of the fundamental laws of biophysics with the accelerating technological performance of the semi-conductor industry. The former inspires faith that the approach can work in theory, the latter that it will work in practice.",

            "text": "Virtual screening, whether of compounds or molecular fragments, has two stages. First, the algorithms attempt to find the correct conformation and position the ligand in the active site of the receptor, and then they try to quantify the quality of particular atomic arrangements by assigning a score. Several technically different approaches to predicting ligand\u2013receptor interactions have been developed, but all are known as \u2018docking\u2019 algorithms after the suggestively named primogenitor program, \u2018DOCK\u2019 [9]. The modeling of ligand\u2013receptor atomic interactions presupposes an accurate three-dimensional molecular structure of the receptor so that inter-atomic forces can be calculated. Since protein folding cannot yet be modeled, this means having an X-ray crystal or NMR structure of the receptor, or a homology model which maps a related protein sequence onto a known structure. A priori one might suppose the experimentally determined crystal structure to be inevitably superior. Surprisingly, a meta-analysis of DOCKing studies concluded that in some cases virtual screening was more successful on homology models compared to experimental structures [11\u2022\u2022]. This seems counter-intuitive, but may indicate that the relaxed precision of the homology models indirectly capture conformational flexibility that is lost in \u2018frozen\u2019, possibly subtly distorted crystal structures. In any case, an homology model must start from a closely related experimental structure, so an important contributing factor in the increased utility of computational drug discovery is the rapid growth in the number of available protein structures (currently approaching 75,000 structures in the Protein Data Base http://www.pdb.org/pdb/statistics/contentGrowthChart.do?content=total&seqid=100), a number which in turn reflects improvements in protein production, robotic crystallization regimens, and the wide availability of sophisticated advanced light sources [12]. Another positive development in virtual screening infrastructure is the creation of curated virtual compound databases that provide large prebuilt sets of virtual representations of commercially available molecules suitable for input to virtual screens. ZINC at the University of California San Francisco [13], and EDULISS at Edinburgh University [14], are two examples. The much larger Chemical Universe Database GDB-13 takes a different approach, attempting to construct the universe of \u2018synthetically plausible\u2019, rather than \u2018available\u2019 compounds [15].",

            "text": "At a high level the performance of dock programs can be measured by two criteria: \u2018DOCKing power\u2019 (the ability to identify the correct experimental ligand binding pose in a collection of incorrect, computer generated \u2018decoy\u2019 poses, i.e. the ability to correctly position ligands in the active site, or to \u2018pose\u2019 them); and \u2018scoring power\u2019 (the ability to produce dock binding scores that correlate with experimentally determined binding affinities). In the past decade a large number of comparative studies of the performance of various dock programs have been undertaken, in both academic and pharmaceutical settings [11\u2022\u2022, 16, 17\u2022\u2022, 18\u2022, 19, 20, 21, 22]. Despite the diverse backgrounds of the investigators, and although these studies differ in methodology and are not directly comparable, they nevertheless unanimously agree on two points. One, dock algorithms fairly accurately pose ligands in the active site, and two, the same dock algorithms poorly score those ligands\u2019 affinity. In other words, dock programs correctly identify the geometry of ligand\u2013receptor systems, but, do not in general accurately predict the binding energy, and therefore cannot predict ligand potency. To make this concrete, a typical dock screen might produce 1000 \u2018hit\u2019 compounds, but, the most potent compounds are as likely to be ranked at the bottom of that list by the scoring function as they are to appear near the top. This is a significant deficiency since the expected potency of a compound often will be the operational feature of interest, for example in prioritizing compounds for medicinal chemistry. In sum, Dock algorithms can \u2018pose\u2019 ligands well but they \u2018score\u2019 them poorly.",

This theoretical insight was followed up in 2005 when \u0394G was shown to be approachable by massively parallel computation. Scaling up to thousands of concurrent CPUs reduced the computational requirement from years to days, and allowed binding free energy of real molecular systems to be computed. Access to this high performance computational resource made possible an important series of proof of concept experiments that in turn produced calculated binding affinities in excellent agreement with corresponding experimental values [26, 27]. Subsequently, the computational methodology has been improved, a better force field refining method has been implemented, and the platform, christened Massively Parallel Computation of Absolute binding Free Energy with well Equilibrated system (MAPLE CAFEE), has been further validated in follow-on projects [28, 29, 30]. Useful thermodynamic calculation comes with a heavy computational burden (an example of the trade-offs between speed and accuracy that turn up in many computational problems), but recent advances in the construction of large-scale computing environments have shrunk the envelope of computational time and brought these methods into the realm of practical application ([31], http://www.nsc.riken.jp/index-eng.html, http://www.fujitsu.com/global/news/pr/archives/month/2010/20100928-01.html).

This strategy allows a small number of abstract fragments to represent thousands of real fragments. For example, benzene, pyridine, pyrimidine, triazine are generalized to an abstract six-membered aromatic ring built of abstract atoms having representative diameter and properties. The approximation is reversed later when abstract structures are replaced by precisely assigning real-atoms that rigorously capture exact physical features including electrostatics, orbitals and van der Waals radii.",

Parallelization, via the Message Passing Interface (MPI) plays a critical role in the system equilibration step of MAPLE CAFEE (Figure 3g), for example by allowing information such as hydrogen bond frequency to be derived and fed back into the drug-design process. Computing the nonequilibrium work term (Figure 3h) invokes numerous MD jobs, and this is made practical by adopting a massively parallel approach. Each MD job generally takes a couple of days on a single CPU core, but MPI parallelism for a microstate MD job would reduce the computational time almost in proportion to the number of cores. Therefore, if 10,000 CPU cores were available, it would be possible to examine hundreds of novel structures in a week without any actual synthesis. This is the biggest advantage of in silico technologies. As an alternative to generic parallelization on commodity clusters, it has recently been shown that specialized, purposed built computer architecture can accelerate MD calculations by two orders of magnitude [33].",

Currently, binding affinity prediction with MAPLE CAFEE tends to be unstable when the actual affinity is very weak or ligands are protonated.

At the discretion of the investigator, physically discovered molecular fragments, for example from NMR or crystal soaks, can be substituted for the virtual fragment inputs. (b) Select a stably positioned set of abstract fragments following drug-design strategies. (c) Exhaustively connect the selected fragments with constraints to generate as many abstract molecular skeletons as possible, then stabilize them with MM. (d) Assign possible real-atoms to the abstract skeletons considering biophysical constraints and synthetic feasibility. (e) Screen out unfavorable structures using heuristics such as the occurrence of pharmacophores that raise toxicological \u2018red flags\u2019. The standard MAPLE CAFEE workflow comprises five steps (f)\u2013(j). (f) Setup molecular models for protein, ligand, and water and assign the force field parameters with Force Field Formulator for Organic Molecules (FF-FOM) [28]. When no co-crystal is available, reasonable initial biding poses should be obtained with docking or other methods. It is notable that having realistic molecular models with refined force field parameters is essential as well as efficient algorithms with reliable computational method for estimation. (g) Equilibrate the system in the initial pose with a MD job. (h) Compute the nonequilibrium work term between bound and unbound equilibrium states. Actually, the two end states are divided into microstates with decoupling parameters, and the trajectories for each microstate are computed with MD jobs. (i) Estimate the most likely representative binding free energies between microstates with the BAR (Bennett Acceptance Ratio) statistical method [34]. (j). Finally, sum up all the micro binding free energies to get the total binding free energy. Molecules can be submitted to MAPLE CAFEE for free energy calculation from any source.
