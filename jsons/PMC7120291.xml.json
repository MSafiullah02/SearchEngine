Multiple studies have described methods to detect CoVs by PCR methods [4\u20137]. In addition, multiple manuscripts have described Sanger sequencing methodologies to investigate the genetic diversity and evolution of individual or partial CoV genes [7\u20139]. However, investigating partial genome of these CoVs underestimates the evolutionary history of these viruses [10].",

In addition, next-generation sequencing ( NGS) technology has facilitated the use of complete genomic sequencing with extreme high coverage and reduced the cost compared to Sanger sequencing. Many laboratories have purchased desktop NGS sequencers to expand their sequencing capabilities, due to the relatively low cost associated with the equipment. However, achieving viral genomes directly from samples can be difficult since the total RNA, including mRNA from host cells and bacteria, is also sequenced [11\u201313]. Nevertheless, NGS technology is a very powerful tool in generating CoV genomes, which could lead to a better understanding of CoV evolution.",

If this occurs, centrifuge the sample for another 20 min at 3000 \u00d7 g.Quantification needs to occur with a fluorometry system that measures only single-stranded nucleic acids and is insensitive to organic contaminants commonly used in extraction kits, which allows for more accurate quantification of input mass and higher probability of successful library preparation.The RNA sample needs to be assessed for the concentration of host ribosomal RNA (rRNA). This assessment does not remove host rRNA, but ensures that the RNA is free of rRNA, which severely dilutes the number of viral reads (Fig. 1).\nThe mRNA purification strategy should be skipped since the oligo-dT-coated magnetic beads were used to specifically bind poly-A-tailed mRNA. The viral RNA will not be poly-A tailed. Start the library preparation at step \u201cIncubate RFP,\u201d which is the start of random primed cDNA synthesis.Typical concentrations of viral RNA libraries for the TruSeq RNA library preparation kit are 1\u201315 ng/\u03bcL.The concentration of coronavirus must be estimated by RT-PCR. However, the concentration by RT- PCR may not indicate successful generation of the complete viral genome since total RNA was used in the library preparation. Generally, lower concentration of viral particles by RT-PCR indicates that more reads are needed to generate a complete genome. If libraries have limited host contamination and have an acceptable concentration of viral RNA (Ct value <25), a 1 million read output per sample should be sufficient for assembly. If more reads are needed per sample, the MiSeq v2 250 PE kit can be used.Two major assembly methodologies are available, reference based and de novo assembly. However, due to the genetic diversity of viruses, gaps in coverage can occur during reference-based assembly. We will briefly discuss both options in this chapter. Reference-based assembly maps the MiSeq reads to a known sequence (template) to build a contig while de novo assembly does not use a sequence to build a contig, which take longer to run. Since the MiSeq generates reads from total RNA, host reads need to be removed to facilitate de novo assembly, which can be done by first mapping the reads to the swine genome and saving the unmapped reads. Hence, the de novo assembly process described here first utilizes a reference-based assembly (to remove host reads) and then a de novo assembly to construct contigs.Many different programs are available to remove adapter sequences and low-quality read and assembly genomes, and each program uses slightly different algorithms and operations to accomplish this task. Removing low-quality reads is necessary before attempting viral assembly.Coverage across the genome will vary and is expected. The valleys, which indicate less coverage, should have approximately the same amount of coverage (Fig. 2a). If valleys with less coverage are comparable to the other valleys with high coverage, the reads did not match to the reference due to genetic diversity of the CoV strain (Fig. 2b).\n\n",
