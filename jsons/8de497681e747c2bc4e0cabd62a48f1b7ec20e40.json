            "text": "Dear Editor, Critical illness and sepsis are often associated with a troponin rise. 1 , 2 Therefore, troponin, in daily clinical practice, is frequently used as a marker of disease severity and as a predictor of future unfavourable outcomes. 1 Recently, several studies including a recent paper in this Journal by Zheng and colleagues, investigated the prognostic role of biomarkers of myocardial injury (i.e. troponins) with mortality in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). [3] [4] [5] Of note, those meta-analyses included studies that reported primarily unadjusted effect estimates of increased in-hospital mortality with higher troponin levels. Compared to patients with normal troponin levels, those with elevated troponins and consequently worse outcome were older and had higher rates of comorbidities including coronary artery disease, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes. [3] [4] [5] As a consequence, the final results of those studies showed a significant heterogeneity and markedly different risk estimates of mortality (risk ratios were 43.24, 3.85, and 7.95, and I 2 were 34%, 90% and 65% for the studies of Zheng et al., Li et al., and Santoso et al. respectively). [3] [4] [5] Therefore, the crucial question is whether cardiac injury is an independent prognostic marker in COVID-19 or it is simply related to the burden of concomitant cardiovascular disease .",

[3] [4] [5] In conclusion, troponin positivity is common in hospitalised COVID-19 patients, and may serve as an additional risk stratification tool in everyday clinical setting. These results are of prognostic importance, since patients with elevated troponins have higher risk of in-hospital mortality, are more prone to deterioration during hospital stay and so deserve more focused clinical attention. The meta-analysis was conducted using the generic inverse variance method, and pooled HR was reported with 95% confidence interval (CI). There was no significant heterogeneity observed across studies.",
