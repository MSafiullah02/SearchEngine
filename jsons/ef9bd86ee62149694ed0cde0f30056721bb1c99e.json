For example, clinical studies found that people that did not experience the situation first-hand often overestimated the likelihood of infections. 24 People who learned the news about the virus away from the epicenter tended to exacerbate their concerns over COVID- 19. 25 Similarly, research after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China found that people far from the earthquake area were more likely to suffer mentally for their higher estimation of postearthquake concern. 5 Understanding the life satisfaction of people with a varying geographical distance to the epicenter is crucial for clinical psychiatrists during the process of screening because the changes in its score are associated with the chance of suffering from mental disorders like depression. 26 27 By revealing that people who were more distant from the epicenter indeed have lower life satisfaction scores, our results guide mental health professionals to prioritize the treatment and habilitation for people based on their geographical distance to the outbreak area.",

Our results suggest that mental health services cannot solely use typhoon eye effect as the only geographical information to identify those with low life satisfaction. The results that only people in the age brackets of 20-40 in regions far from the epicenter were more likely to experience lower levels of life satisfaction indicate that mental healthcare providers can indeed use typhoon eye effect only for people in those age brackets. This guidance is especially notable giving research has already differentiated adults by age groups regarding COVID-19 symptoms. Similarly, only adults with small family sizes in regions far from the epicenter were more likely to experience lower levels of life satisfaction, and hence mental healthcare providers can use typhoon eye effect to screen for mental health issues among people with small families.LimitationsThe context of this study has a clear epicenter of COVID-19, Wuhan, in China. However, not all countries have a single epicenter. For example, South Korea simultaneously had several epicenters 32 , which opened new research avenues on the effect of geographical distance in the presence of multiple epicenters. In addition, the design was unable to capture the dynamic movement of the citizens across the cities in China over time to observe the fluctuations in the well-being over time.
