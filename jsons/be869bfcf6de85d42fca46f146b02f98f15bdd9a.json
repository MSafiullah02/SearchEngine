ABSTRACT The UK Government recognised the importance of vaccines in the control of new emerging disease threats and in 2015 established the UK Vaccine Network to focus on specific areas of need. One of these was the understanding of what is involved in the development of a new vaccine and what are the potential bottlenecks to a rapid response in the face of a pandemic such as COVID-19. A Working Group was established to initially produce a Vaccine Development Process Map for a Human Vaccine. However, in view of the importance of animal wellbeing and the significant impact of diseases with Zoonotic potential, a similar Map has been created outlining the Veterinary Vaccine Development Process. This paper describes the production of that Map and covers the process from the generation of a Target Product Profile (TPP) through Discovery and Feasibility, and on to Product Development and Registration.",

            "text": "The first step in any vaccine development project with a commercial target in mind should be the creation of a TPP. This sets out clear parameters for the characteristics of the desired end product, and ensures that various disciplines are aligned on required outcomes, product characteristics and measures of success. The TPP also guides the design, conduct and analysis of safety and efficacy trials, as it allows the development team to focus on the characteristics of the vaccine and to ensure that the proposed regulatory trials generate the required data. A good TTP should identify the \"optimal target\" and a \"minimal target.\" For example, an optimal target for dosage schedule may be one vaccination that lasts a lifetime and a minimally acceptable target may be a series of vaccinations over a certain time period with a more limited duration of immunity. The online Map identifies a number of critical points throughout the process at which the TPP should either be reassessed or revised. Once an appropriate immunogenic formulation has been identified then a project can move into the Feasibility Phase. Many of the steps are essentially the same for human and veterinary vaccines and both targeted at identifying a lead candidate. However, the veterinary Feasibility Process will include proof-of-concept safety and efficacy studies within the target species for the vaccine. It is important to ensure that the immune response elicited by the vaccine correlates with protection within the host and thus the optimum immunisation strategy can be developed. This will result in the identification of a lead vaccine formulation(s) to proceed into full development. At this stage it is wise to ensure that that you have freedom to operate with regards to any pre-existing intellectual property and to file for patent protection of your vaccine, if it is sufficiently novel. With a veterinary vaccine there is generally a greater degree of confidence for successful licensure at the end of the feasibility process based on clinical trial results within the relevant host before the vaccine enters the more costly Development Phase.",

Particular requirements at this phase include the qualitative and quantitative details of the vaccine's constituents (seeds, adjuvants, preservatives, stabilisers, etc), an outline description of the manufacturing process, details of the starting materials, certification on the freedom from TSEs, details of quality control tests, a description of batch safety testing, batch to batch consistency data, stability testing data and a product release potency test. The potency test confirms the suitability of each vaccine batch and it can be either an in vitro or in vivo assay (3) . A good test will guarantee the efficacy of the finished vaccine over its product shelf-life and it will generally be used to generate real time stability data on the vaccine.",

Field Trials should be conducted according to the VICH Guideline (GL9) on Good Clinical Practice (GCP). This will provide a unified standard for the EU, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and the USA to facilitate the mutual acceptance of clinical data by the relevant regulatory authorities.

The development process for a veterinary vaccine typically takes between 3 to 6 years in total depending on the country in which the product is being registered, the technology being used and the target species. By contrast the Human Vaccine Development Process can take between 10 to 20 years. The details of the process will de dependant on the nature of the vaccine that is being developed. For more traditional vaccine approaches it will depend on whether they are live (attenuated) or killed (inactivated) products (7) . The development process will also need to be modified to take account of vaccines that are based on novel recombinant technology (8) . The online process Map was launched in September 2019 and can now be found on the MRC Vaccine Development website (http://vaccinedevelopment.org.uk). This Process Map is intended to be a general guide to help those working on new vaccines and facilitate the vaccine R&D process. It should only be used in consultation with the relevant experts and it is important to recognise that every vaccine development project will have its own unique requirements.",

Early Discovery work may be carried out in laboratory animals in order to screen a number of potential vaccine candidates and select promising formulations. However, such laboratory animal models are often poor indicators of a vaccine's safety and protective efficacy within the target species. Therefore, studies within the target species are generally used in veterinary vaccine research to identify promising vaccine candidates and reach an early demonstration of efficacy for the intended product. This early testing involving the intended host is a key difference between veterinary and human vaccine discovery. Another important component of the Discovery Process is the understanding of the pathogen and the immune response within the intended target species. This in turn will facilitate the development of a suitable challenge model designed to mimic natural infection that can be used to assess the protective efficacy of experimental vaccines.",
