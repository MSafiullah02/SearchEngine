Water was also provided ad libitum using a soaked cotton pad in each cage. Fifteen minutes PE, all flies in each group were immobilized at \u221220 \u25e6C for 2 min and then transferred into two 50-ml Falcon conical tubes (SPL Life Sciences Co., Ltd., Pocheon, South Korea). The external body surface of flies was washed up with 10 ml of sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 135 mmol/liter NaCl, 3 mmol/liter Na2HPO4 12 H2O, and 13 mmol/liter NaH2PO4 2H2O, pH 7.2). Then the first wash fluid (S1) was transferred into the 1.5-ml microtubes. Once again, the external body surface of flies was washed by vortexing with 10 ml of 70% ethanol and rinsed by 10 ml of distilled water after discarding the ethanol. Thereafter, fly bodies were transferred to a new falcon tube by sterile forceps and again body surface of flies was washed up with 10 ml of sterile PBS. Second body surface specimen (S2) from the last PBS washing was collected in microtubes. The washed bodies of all 50 flies were homogenized together by chilled and sterile mortar and pestle while 10 ml of PBS was gently added. The homogenate was taken in sterile microtubes and centrifuged at 3000\u00d7g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5417R, Hamburg, Germany).

Finally, its concentration was determined by Epoch microplate spectrophotometer (BioTek instrument, United States) as nanogram per microliter. The copy number of H9 gene in the standard was calculated according to the following formula: Number of copies (molecules) = (X ng \u00d7 6.0221 \u00d7 1023 molecules/mole)/ [(N \u00d7 660 g/mole) \u00d7 1 \u00d7 109 ng/g], where X is amount of amplicon (ng), N is length of dsDNA amplicon and 660 g/mole = average mass of 1 bp dsDNA. Standard curve was generated using a decimal serial dilution of the PCR product of H9 gene and plotting the threshold cycle values (Ct value) against the log concentrations of copy numbers (Fig. 1).",

House flies inhabit manure, spoiled foods, carcasses, and synanthropic environments (Sawabe et al. 2006, Junqueira et al. 2017). Additionally, surfaces are easily contaminated with virus particles due to fly foraging habits, regurgitation, and defecation (Sawabe et al. 2009), depositing eggs (Calibeo-Hayes et al. 2003) and also grooming activities (Tan et al. 1997). Anatomically, the fly\u2019s body is covered with hairs, the legs are bristled, the foot pads adhesive, and the proboscis are all well suited to being contaminated (Tyasasmaya et al. 2016, Junqueira et al. 2017).",

            "text": "Our important finding was detection of H9-specific RNA within house flies up to 96 h, which was not detected any longer at 120 h after the exposure. These results are consistent with those of Wanaratana et al. (2011) who observed the same length of time for positive RRT-PCR results of whole homogenate of house fly bodies PE to AIV H5N1. More recently, in 2016, a viral exposure experiment also showed the existence of AIV H5N1 for at least 24 h in gastrointestinal tracts of house flies (Tyasasmaya et al. 2016). In crop of house flies, live Newcastle disease virus (NDV) was detected up to 96 h after initial exposure to NDV while it remained viable only 24 h in midgut and hindgut (Watson et al. 2007). However, the H5N1 AIV was isolated from the feces of blowflies Calliphora nigribarbis (Vollenhoven 1863) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) at 48 h after exposure (Sawabe et al. 2009). Under experimental conditions, sugar was used in feeding meal and high sugar concentration correlates with meal storage in crop, even for several days (Greenberg 1973). Thus, dissemination of virus through defecation and specially regurgitation seems more feasible. Flies were not dissected in the current study; however, in order to elucidate different probable routes of virus transmission and spread by flies, we are currently in the process of discovering virus retention sites in each dissected body fractures comparatively.",

            "text": "Our result also showed that the outer surface of house fly during initial 24 h could carry less load of viral RNAs than interior parts of flies which seems directly in line with the destructive effect of temperature and ultraviolet light on labile AI viruses (Chumpolbanchorn et al. 2006), but the most important clinically relevant finding was the decline in concentration of viral RNAs during the time after exposure to AIV H9N2 either outside or within house flies. The virus did not replicate inside the house fly, supporting the dominant paradigm of mechanical but not biological transmission of avian viruses; rotavirus, turkey coronavirus, reticuloendotheliosis virus, and NDV (Tan et al. 1997, Calibeo-Hayes et al. 2003, Davidson and Braverman 2005, Barin et al. 2010). Although this is the first experimental study elucidating the dynamic of H9N2 AIV retention in flies, it did not evaluate the viability of virus post-exposure. But generally, the RNA load probably is a high estimate of the viable virus that could be present and that when the samples are negative for RNA, there should not be any viable virus present, however, particularly HPAI H5N1 was shown to remain viable up to 72 h in a similar experiment (Wanaratana et al. 2011). Further works, which take viability of the viruses into account, is intended to be undertaken using subsequent inoculation to culture media or chickens. The answer to the question \u2018if the number of viral particles suffice to be transmitted and to infect a chicken in different critical routes?\u2019 is deferred to our future work in controlled field conditions.",
