Of the 205,013 cumulative confirmed cases of Zika infection across the world, 130,840 were in Brazil [2], where differences by region and level of education in access to and use of health services persist. In fact, most microcephaly cases were concentrated in Northeastern Brazil, where health inequities are higher.",

However, populations do not have equal access to information on contraception and in a number of countries in the Americas, such as Brazil, the country most affected by the Zika outbreak, abortion is illegal. However, to date the changes in legislation in either country have yet to take shape [13]. Preventive measures also included recommendations such as avoiding locations likely to contain infected mosquitos, covering oneself completely with clothing, and applying repellents, among other individual level preventative measures [14, 15].",

These factors subjected women to a degree of greater or lesser vulnerability. We described elsewhere how the lives of women were deeply affected by the emotional impact caused by the Zika epidemic [16].

Years of research in communication and psychology show that public opinion change is much more challenging than opinion formation [17]. To be most effective, public health campaigns must provide information that helps the public understand the causes of the disease in media formats that are accessible to various ethnic and socioeconomic segments of the population. Another important factor to consider is how the political contexts and history of a country influence the population reaction to an epidemic such as Zika. Many countries in the Americas where Zika was present had challenging political and economic circumstances. For instance, Brazil, which had the greatest number of Zika cases, is a country with high levels of economic inequality and structural deficiencies in sanitation and health care. Most women and children affected by Zika lived in arduous conditions. As the Zika epidemic evolved, Brazil went through one of the greatest economic and political crises in its history [18]. Puerto Rico, also greatly affected by the epidemic, suffered from socioeconomic inequality and a strong economic crisis. Women in Puerto Rico have historically suffered the effects of forced sterilization [19]. Such legacies are still felt in the current Zika epidemic, since \u201ceffective action has been complicated by lingering suspicions related to historical activities\u2026. Misinformation has clouded\u2026 the best ways to protect individuals and communities\u201d [20].",

In addition, few studies have so far been conducted to address the impacts that the Zika epidemic had on women\u2019s lives at the transnational level, and the ways in which women dealt with Zika outbreaks have yet to be documented. The psychosocial implications of the Zika epidemic are essential for a complete understanding of its long-term repercussions.

The micro level included individual actions, and behavioural changes (protective behaviours). Recurrent topics were assigned codes and sorted into categories and subcategories within an initial coding frame that accounted for the diverse layers of health determinants underscored by socio-ecological theoretical frameworks (Fig. 1). Transcripts were systematically coded by Dr. ARLA using NVivo software\u00ae for data analysis. The process began by generating a few free nodes; then ideas or key words derived from the interviews were used to code the text into main themes and derived themes, usually called coding tree. Codes continued to be created, merged, and modified as data collection and analysis progressed, employing a combination of deductive and inductive approaches. Dr. MR and Dr. ES collaborated with Dr. ARLA to create the structure of the node tree. They coded several interviews independently and discussed the node tree during several meetings before consensus was achieved. We adopted pseudonyms for all participants to maintain anonymity.\n",

Two participants were misdiagnosed with Zika while pregnant, one had a husband diagnosed with the virus while pregnant, one was suspected of bearing a child with microcephaly, and six had a positive diagnosis of Zika though not pregnant.

The results of this pilot study suggest the importance of considering social science approaches to understand risk and adopt public health measures to control epidemics. Financial, social, religious and cultural aspects are always involved in epidemics. The Zika epidemic was yet another lost opportunity to increase culturally sensitive family planning services, since the particular costs of the ZIKV for maternal and perinatal health demanded a broad spectrum of health interventions. Our findings call for public health interventions that go beyond individual level behavioral change campaigns, to more comprehensively address the broader meso and macro level factors that influence women\u2019s\u2019 willingness and agency to protect themselves.",
