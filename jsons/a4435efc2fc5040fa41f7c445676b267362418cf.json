            "text": "With regard to the peripheral nervous system, it is still unknown if and how SARS-CoV-2 can affect it in previously healthy individuals or in patients with a diagnosis of neuropathy. There are a few anecdotal reports of acute immunemediated neuropathy (i.e. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 and Miller-Fisher syndromes) in patients with coronavirus infection, including SARS-CoV-2 [8] [9] [10] and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV [11] , raising the possibility that peripheral nervous system can be directly or indirectly affected by the virus. The main concern resides however for patients with peripheral nerve disorders on immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies who may also have respiratory muscle weakness. These patients may be at higher risk of contracting the infection and/or of experiencing severe manifestations of COVID-19. There are numerous recommendations trying to provide clarity and guidance even if, so far, there are no formal evidence-based recommendations from clinical societies or governments for the management of immunosuppressive treatment in these patients. Immunotherapy decision varies significantly from country to country, ranging from highly provider directed to collaborative decision-making model. In order to inform the neurological community and patients, the Italian Association of the Peripheral Nervous System (ASNP), the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology (SINC) and the Italian Society of Neurology (SIN) have developed a joint document to provide the best practices for managing patients with immune-mediated neuropathy during the global spread of COVID-19. The following document should be interpreted as a collection of indications or advice developed by neurologists with expertise in immune-mediated polyneuropathies (i.e. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and its variants (GBS); chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN), Lewis-Sumner, polyneuropathies associated with monoclonal gammopathy with or without anti-MAG antibodies and neuropathies during vasculitis). These practical recommendations should be individualized according to the severity and the progression of the neuropathy, the local healthcare strategic planning and COVID-19 infection risk.",
