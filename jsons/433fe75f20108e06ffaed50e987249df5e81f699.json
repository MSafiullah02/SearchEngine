            "text": "Simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) have had considerable success at crossing species barriers; both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 and HIV-2 have been transmitted on multiple occasions from SIV-infected natural host species. However, the precise evolutionary and ecological mechanisms characterizing a successful cross-species transmission event remain to be elucidated. Here, in addition to expanding and clarifying our previous description of the adaptation of a diverse, naturally occurring SIVsm inoculum to a new rhesus macaque host, we present an analytical framework for understanding the selective forces driving viral adaptation to a new host. A preliminary analysis of large-scale changes in virus population structure revealed that viruses replicating in the macaques were subject to increasing levels of selection through day 70 postinfection (p.i.), whereas contemporaneous viruses in the mangabeys remained similar to the source inoculum. Three different site-by-site methods were employed to identify the amino acid sites responsible for this macaque-specific selection. Of 124 amino acid sites analyzed, 3 codons in V2, a 2-amino acid shift in an N-linked glycosylation site, and variation at 2 sites in the highly charged region were consistently evolving under either directional or diversifying selection at days 40 and 70 p.i. This strong macaque-specific selection on the V2 loop underscores the importance of this region in the adaptation of SIVsm to rhesus macaques. Due to the extreme viral diversity already extant in the naturally occurring viral inoculum, we employed a broad range of phylogenetic and numerical tools in order to distinguish the signatures of past episodes of selection in viral sequences from more recent selection pressures.",

In some cases the mechanisms by which animal pathogens cross the species barrier are relatively easy to identify (Qu et al. 2005; Wang et al. 2005) ; however, zoonotic transmissions are most often due to very complex interactions between ecological, evolutionary, biochemical, and sociological factors (Hahn et al. 2000 ; Palese 2004 ). Thus, not only is it difficult to identify the causes of past zoonotic epidemics, but these complex interactions may also hinder our ability to predict future epidemics.

The high mutation and replicative rates of RNA viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and influenza facilitate the occurrence and fixation of such beneficial mutations (Moya et al. 2004) . Viral adaptations to new hosts primarily manifest as amino acid substitutions, which can allow more efficient virus cell entry in the new host (Ito et al. 1998; Qu et al. 2005) , block interactions with detrimental host proteins (Mangeat et al. 2003; Stremlau et al. 2004) , and promote escape from both the new and the old host's immune responses (Smith et al. 2004; Wei et al. 2003) . Should potentially adaptive mutations occur naturally before transmission (Demma et al. 2005) or be maintained in an intermediate host (Ito et al. 1998 ), the zoonotic virus will have a head start adapting to its new host environment. Thus, high viral genetic diversity in the reservoir host may be a dominant criterion discriminating a successful zoonosis from a dead-end exposure (Demma et al. 2006) .",

By comparing changes in viral population structure after infection of both SMs and RMs with the identical diverse viral inoculum, we can identify the specific genetic targets of zoonotic adaptation and gain insight into what selective forces might be driving this zoonotic adaptation. Essentially, natural selection after a cross-species transmission would act like a sieve, favoring those amino acid polymorphisms critical for direct hostvirus interactions in the new host, while ignoring neutral sequence variation and specific adaptations to immune responses of the previous host. Therefore, our experiment in cross-species adaptation will not only allow us to understand how a viral envelope adapts to a new host, but will also facilitate identification of particular residues in env, which are critical for its functional robustness.",

In these studies, analysis of the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions have revealed particular genes or amino acid sites that are under positive diversifying selection pressure due to immune responses against these sites. These studies of adaptation have been crucial to our understanding of how immunodeficiency viruses adapt to host immune responses. However, because of the preadapted condition of these virus isolates and the lack of genetic diversity upon which zoonotic selection can act, they do not sufficiently address the question of how diverse naturally occurring virus populations adapt to a new host species. Furthermore, if the spread of SIV into humans was mediated by direct contact with blood from African nonhuman primates (Hahn et al. 2000) , the first infected human would have been exposed to a large, and likely very diverse, bolus of virus.",

However, this diversity is the result of the virus having adapted to an animal whose immune responses have left their mark on the virus population's genetic structure (Demma et al. 2006) . Therefore, simply calculating the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions at each codon in virus sequences sampled shortly after infection may not reliably distinguish between the evolutionary signatures of immune responses in the donor animal from the selective forces mediating adaptation to the recipient new host species. Thus, it is important to minimize the influence of this preexisting selective signature in zoonotic viral sequence analyses by characterizing fluctuations in the overall viral population structure as well as amino acid frequency changes at specific polymorphic sites. Therefore, we have employed a combination of intuitive population genetic analyses and more complex models of codon substitution in order to extend our previous analyses (Demma et al. 2005) of the evolution of a natural and diverse SIVsm env variable loop 1 and 2 (V1V2) after transmission to a nonnatural RM host. This previous study described strong RM-specific restriction in the N-linked glycosylation (N-glyc) motif density and length of the V1 loop at days 10 and 14 postinfection (p.i.) followed by the emergence after day 100 p.i. of a diverse viral population with an allelic distribution more similar to that of the source inoculum (SI). Here, employing previously unused numerical analyses and a more comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the same viral sequence data, we detect strong RM-specific selection in the V2 loop at days 40 and 70 p.i., which underscores this region's importance in adaptation to the RMs. Most prominently, changes in the position and frequency of an N-glyc motif in the V2 loop likely represent an adaptation either to a divergent CD4 or chemokine coreceptor or to an as-of-yet undetermined target cell population.",

Their course of viremia, immunological profiles, and viral genetic characteristics have been previously described (Demma et al. 2005; Silvestri et al. 2005) . Briefly, the virus replicated well in all 3 SMs but only 2 of the 3 RMs (RHt and RZw), with peak viremia ranging from 5.0 3 10 7 to 1.6 3 10 9 viral copies per milliliter plasma and chronic phase setpoints ranging from 1 3 10 5 to 5 3 10 6 copies per milliliter. Due to its low to undetectable SIVsm viremia, RQl is not included in any subsequent analyses. Viral sequences were sampled from plasma viral RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction at intervals throughout the first year of infection, and multiple clonal isolates of the virus envelope V1V2 region were amplified and sequenced. Input viral RNA copy number was not normalized prior to reverse transcription. However, viral load was not significantly different between animals at each time point, limiting potential copy number bias for within-time point comparisons. Furthermore, dilutions of a SI cDNA pool were subjected to the same PCR conditions, cloned, and then sequenced to rule out any potential input copy number bias. Finally, multiple PCR reactions were run on several samples to ensure the consistency of sequence results from each reaction. All sequences can be found in GenBank with accession numbers AY852284-AY852962.",

The number of adaptive events occurring in SIVsm replicating in SMs remains relatively stable, fluctuating moderately around 0 through day 70 p.i. This is consistent with the notion that virus populations having replicated in SMs for centuries need not adapt to other SMs prior to the development of humoral immune responses. In contrast, SIVsm exhibits a very distinct but consistent adaptive pattern in both viremic RMs. The low, negative values at day 14 p.i. reflect the early outgrowth of a single variant from an SI-containing multiple distinct variants (or alleles) of this region of env. Following this restriction, a succession of amino acid substitutions in the replicating viral populations occurs between days 14 and 70. This increase in the number of adaptive events in the RM virus populations is significant ( fig. 2B ; Spearman's rank correlation, P , 0.05) and, due to its occurrence before the development of strong nAb responses, is most likely the result of virus adaptation to divergent host cell receptors or target cell subsets. The subsequent decrease in adaptive events in RMs between days 70 and 100 reflects the outgrowth of viral variants more representative of the SI and presumably better able to escape emerging humoral immune responses. That virus populations in the SMs do not deviate significantly from the allelic distribution seen in the SI until after day 70 further supports the notion that humoral immune pressures first develop between day 70 and 100 in these infected animals and select for particular variants resulting in the observed increase in the number of adaptive events at day 100.",

The relatively wider distribution of day 100 RM clones reflects the later reemergence of variants more closely related to the SI and are probably indicative of the onset of effective nAb responses. Strikingly, though, the majority of day 70 variants in both RMs fall into either 1 clade ( fig. 3 RHt) or 2 clades ( fig. 3, RZw) .

We then classified sites within animals as being under selection based on criteria laid out in Sheridan et al. (2004) . Despite some variation among sites and species in the temporal pattern of evolution, the sites under selection are largely the same between RMs and SMs and are primarily located in V1. Interestingly, the 3 sites (80, 81, and 105) found to be under selection exclusively in the RMs were also under selection between days 40 and 100 p.i., the same interval over which the virus populations only in the RMs underwent multiple adaptive events ( fig. 4) . Thus, it is likely that amino acid substitutions or changes in the relative abundance of amino acid polymorphisms at each of these sites mediate SIVsm adaptation to this new host.",

Sites exhibiting large fluctuations (.20% shifts) in amino acid composition were identified as being under directional selection and thus most likely represent specific adaptations to the RMs. Overall, a much larger number of amino acid positions were identified as being under RM-specific selection pressures than in the analysis of phylogenetic substitutions (fig. 4) .

Selection at sites 30 and 32 represent the RM-specific loss of 1 N-glyc motif at day 10 and 14 p.i. previously identified (Demma et al. 2005) . Although this N-glyc site remains absent or at low levels until day 100, the viral populations in the RMs continue to adapt to the new host environment through changes in consensus amino acid frequencies at 2 specific loci: the highly charged region of V2 (sites 80 and 81) and another N-glyc site (sites 104 and 105). Interestingly, the polymorphism at site 105 (Ser to Asn) causes a 2-amino acid, C-terminal shift in an N-glyc site (see fig. 1 ). Taken together, these data demonstrate a continued strong selection pressure during the postacute phase of infection for specific variants, presumably better adapted to the divergent cellular and genetic environment of the RMs. ). This phenomenon not only underscores the importance of viral diversity within donor animals for the potential success of cross-species virus transmission but may also obscure the interpretation of more traditional site-by-site likelihood analyses of codon substitution. The large number of viruses (1 3 10 6 ) inoculated into our experimentally infected animals ensures that the signatures of selection on the virus population in the SI animal will be transmitted as well. Thus measurements of the numbers of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions (per nonsynonymous and synonymous site, respectively) early in the course of infection will mainly reflect selection biases predating the inoculation of our experimental animals. These sites should be easily identified as those either unaccompanied by changes in relative amino acid abundance or those which are under positive diversifying selection in both species. It is therefore necessary to compare the ability of codon substitution models to identify RM-specific sites under selection with our other sitewise analyses.",

In contrast, only 1 site (104) out of the 5 (sites 80, 81, 84, 102, and 104) identified to be evolving under positive selection in V2 was also detected in SMs. Two of these sites (site 84 and 102) were not identified in any other analysis, and therefore, differences between the estimated numbers of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions likely predated this infection experiment.

By applying several evolutionary analyses to serially sampled virus populations for the first 100 days of infection, we have been able to identify the amino acid positions responsible for the continued adaptation of a diverse SIVsm inoculum to the new RM cellular and genetic environment. The polymorphisms mediating this adaptation were already present in the SI and primarily alter the density and position of N-glyc sites on the virus envelope. In addition, we also demonstrate the utility of a multifaceted approach to studying viral sequence evolution, which combines complex phylogenetic methods and simple intuitive analyses to identify and discriminate between sites that were selected for in the SM reservoir host from those that have only recently come under selection in the new RM host.",

Because all of the sequences obtained from the database were the result of one or several accidental transmissions from SMs to RMs of a single SIVsm subtype (8) only recently described (Apetrei et al. 2005 , we cannot rule out the alternative hypotheses that this site is not polymorphic in the SIVsm subtype-8 envelope or that this polymorphism was fixed in RMs due to an extreme bottleneck upon transmission. Regardless, it is probably not entirely coincidental that these subtype-8 viruses were the first to be described infecting RMs because SMs infected with other lineages of SIVsm were used in the experiments now thought to have facilitated the first SIV transmission to RMs but did not engender persistent infection of RMs .",

Thus, preferential expansion in the RMs of viruses encoding this shifted N-glyc site as well as amino acid residues at sites 80 and 81 strongly suggests that these mutations are specific adaptations to the divergent RM genetic and cellular environment, as opposed to adaptations to new host immune responses. The partial reversion of this N-glyc site to its N-terminal position beyond day 70 p.i. is due to the reemergence of the presumably more immunologically evasive variants containing both of the N-glyc sites in V1 at amino acid positions 30 and 42 (see fig. 1 ). The lack of linkage between the C-terminally shifted N-glyc site polymorphism in V2 and the V1 loop variants containing both N-glyc sites among all the viruses sampled in our study suggests that this adaptation in V2 may actually be disadvantageous in the presence of a highly glycosylated V1.",

However, the fact that the level of vi-remia (Broussard et al. 2001; Goldstein et al. 2005 ) and the rate of infected target cell turnover (Ho et al. 1995; Mohri et al. 1998) (Silvestri G, personal communication) are similar in both pathogenic and nonpathogenic hosts suggests that SIVs replicating in their natural hosts may be better able to use multiple chemokine coreceptors to facilitate entry into a broader array of short-lived target cells than their counterparts infecting pathogenic hosts. Whether this dearth of CCR5 expression in natural hosts results in lower levels of SIV infection of memory CD41 T cells or is simply a hallmark of the lower level of immune activation seen in the natural hosts, this phenomenon underscores the dramatic difference between SMs and RMs in their immune FIG. 4 .-Summary of the amino acid sites found to be under selection for all 3 site-by-site analyses. Analyses are partitioned by analysis then by species and then by time point. Gray boxes indicate selection at that site and time point. ''1'' or ''\u00c0'' symbols indicate the presence of positive or purifying selection, respectively, as determined by the maximum likelihood analysis of dN and dS (P , 0.25, likelihood ratio test). Sites with gray forward hatching indicate the sites in V2 found to be under selection in a majority of the analyses. Sites with gray backward hatching are the sites in V2 found to be under positive selection by only the likelihood method.",
