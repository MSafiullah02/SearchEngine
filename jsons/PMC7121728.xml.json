The shell membrane lies immediately beneath the shell; this is a tough fibrinous membrane that forms the air sac in the region of the blunt end of the egg (Fig. 1). In contrast to the shell membrane, chorioallantoic, amniotic, and yolk membranes are comprised largely of epithelium, and represent potential sites of coronaviral replication. The chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) lies directly beneath the shell membrane; this is a highly vascular membrane that serves as the respiratory organ of the embryo. The CAM is the largest of the embryo membranes, and it encloses the largest cavity within the egg, the allantoic cavity; in the embryonated chicken egg, this cavity contains approximately 5\u201310 ml of fluid, depending upon the stage of embryonation. The amniotic membrane encloses the embryo and forms the amniotic cavity; in the embryonated chicken egg, this cavity contains approximately 1 ml fluid. The yolk sac is attached to the embryo and contains the nutrients the embryo utilizes during embryonic development and the immediate post-hatch period.\n",

Embryonated eggs may be inoculated by depositing virus directly onto the CAM, or by depositing virus within allantoic, amniotic, and yolk sacs [6]. For avian coronaviruses, inoculation of eggs by allantoic or amniotic routes has been shown to provide these viruses with access to specific cell types that support their replication [2\u20134]. IBV is an epitheliotropic virus that replicates in a variety of epithelial tissues in the post-hatch chicken including respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, bursa of Fabricius, and oviduct [7]. In the embryonated chicken egg, IBV replicates well regardless of inoculation route; however, the allantoic route is favored as the virus replicates extensively in epithelium of the CAM and high titers are shed into allantoic fluid [8]. A pheasant coronavirus has been isolated and propagated in embryonated chicken eggs using procedures similar to those utilized for IBV (allantoic route inoculation) [3]. TCoV also is epitheliotropic in post-hatch chickens and turkeys, but replicates only in epithelium lining the intestinal tract and bursa of Fabricius [1, 4, 9]. These cellular tropisms of TCoV also are observed in the embryonated egg; the virus replicates only in embryonic intestines and bursa of Fabricius, sites that are reached only via amniotic inoculation.",

Filtration of samples will reduce virus titer, and should be used only when necessary.The accuracy of delivering an inoculum into the amniotic sac using this method may be determined by sham-inoculation of embryos with a dye such as crystal violet (0.2 % crystal violet in 95 % ethanol), then opening eggs and determining site of dye deposition.A distinct advantage of Method A is that visualization of the embryo is not required. Method B requires visualization of the embryo, and this is may not be possible for embryonated eggs having a dark shell color (e.g., turkey eggs, brown chicken eggs). Method A also requires less skill for delivery of inoculum into the amniotic cavity, but is more prone to error than Method B with the possibility of inoculum being deposited at sites other than the amniotic cavity. If the embryo can be visualized, a potential advantage of Method B is more precise delivery of inoculum into the amniotic cavity as compared with Method A.Embryo deaths that occur <24 h after inoculation generally are due to bacterial contamination, toxicity of the inoculum, or injury.Refrigeration kills the embryo and causes the blood to clot. This prevents contamination of allantoic fluid with blood.Multiple passages in embryonated eggs may be necessary for initial isolation of coronaviruses; allantoic fluid is used as inoculum for additional passages in embryonated eggs. Embryos at each passage should be evaluated for gross lesions. For IBV, embryo-lethal strains generally result in embryos with cutaneous hemorrhage; non-embryo-lethal strains result in stunting, curling, clubbing of down, or urate deposits in the mesonephros of the kidney. In some cases, virus replication in embryonated eggs may not be associated with readily detectable embryo lesions.Allantoic fluids commonly are examined for presence of coronavirus using electron microscopy or RT-PCR procedures. Alternatively, immunohistochemical detection may be accomplished by staining sections of allantoic membrane or the allantoic epithelial cells that are present in allantoic fluid (these should be collected by centrifugation prior to freezer storage of allantoic fluid).TCoV rarely results in embryo mortality. Typically, only those eggs with live embryos are examined following the specified incubation period; however, the possibility of embryo-lethal viruses should not be overlooked.The method of euthanasia employed will depend upon the method used to detect virus in inoculated embryos. Fresh tissues are required if immunohistochemistry is to be employed; for this, embryos should be euthanized by cervical dislocation or exposed briefly to carbon dioxide gas.Intestinal contents commonly are examined for presence of coronaviruses using electron microscopy or RT-PCR procedures. Alternatively, immunohistochemical detection may be accomplished by staining sections of intestines or bursa of Fabricius.\n",
