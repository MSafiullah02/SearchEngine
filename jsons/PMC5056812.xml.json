The importance of the prenatal environment in influencing neurodevelopmental outcomes in infancy, childhood, and adulthood is becoming increasingly better understood (Bale et al., 2010, Richetto and Riva, 2014). There is mounting evidence to suggest that maternal influences on the prenatal environment, including stress, malnutrition, medications, and infections, play a fundamental role in later behavioral and cognitive functioning in offspring (Richetto and Riva, 2014).",

Maternal immune activation has also been hypothesized to result in cognitive impairments, although few human studies on this topic exist (Richetto and Riva, 2014). The timing of infection during pregnancy has also been suggested to play an important role, yet few studies have distinguished infections by trimester (Atladottir et al., 2010, Werenberg Dreier et al., 2016). Treatment of infection is another important component since studies have linked medications, specifically acetaminophen and antibiotics, with neurodevelopmental outcomes, including ASD and ADHD (Liew et al., 2014, Liew et al., 2015, Brandlistuen et al., 2013, Thompson et al., 2014, Atladottir et al., 2012). Lastly, the influence of infection on a range of neurodevelopmental measures in childhood, such as subclinical effects, in contrast to a specific clinical diagnosis, has not been addressed.",

Our findings are inconsistent with a study conducted in the Danish National Birth Cohort that reported no association between respiratory tract infection in any trimester of pregnancy and ASD when compared to children of mothers reporting no infections during pregnancy (Atladottir et al., 2012). Another study reported increased risks of ASD for first trimester viral infections and second trimester bacterial infections (Atladottir et al., 2010), but infections included were only those resulting in hospitalization. Late gestation has also been suggested to be an exceptionally vulnerable period with respect to neurodevelopment, (Bitanihirwe et al., 2010) yet lack of information on infection in the third trimester prevented us from exploring this particular question.",

Previous studies found prolonged fever (\u2265 7 days) to be associated with a 2-fold risk of autism (Atladottir et al., 2012).

Associations between URI and both mother- and teacher-reported behavior problems were stronger when the infection was treated with antibiotics than when the infection was untreated. Compared to the association for untreated infection and behavioral outcomes, treatment with acetaminophen or guaifenesin was associated with poorer behavior according to mother-report only. Several studies have explored the association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and behavioral outcomes among offspring (Liew et al., 2014, Thompson et al., 2014, Liew et al., 2015). Acetaminophen use, for any indication, has been associated with slight increases in conduct and hyperactivity problems and ASD with hyperkinetic symptoms and these associations remained when multivariate models included infection/fever as a covariate. In the present study, differences in scores among treatment groups were small and inconsistent and both treated and untreated infections were associated with increases in behavior problems.",

            "text": "Limitations of the present study should be noted. Data on URI was collected retrospectively by maternal self-report up to three years after delivery, which may have resulted in misclassification of exposure if URI was not accurately reported. In the present study, 16% and 17% of mothers reported having a URI during lunar months 2\u20133 and 4\u20135, respectively, compared to 22.8% and 21.9% reported for the first trimester and second trimester, respectively among participants in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (Collier et al., 2009). Misclassification of URI with respect to timing, duration, and symptoms is also possible. It is possible that women mistook another illness with similar symptoms (i.e. allergies) for a URI. URI is an umbrella term for infections as it included flu-like illness, sinus infections, and the common cold. Due to this limitation, we were unable to explore specific infections, nor distinguish between bacterial and viral infections. Measures of URI in late pregnancy were not available, thereby restricting our ability to explore late pregnancy infection as a risk factor for neurodevelopmental outcomes and perhaps missing an etiologic relevant period. The exposure misclassification is not expected to be differential with respect to neurodevelopmental outcomes, since such outcomes were measured after the interview. We also lacked serologic confirmation of self-reported infection as well as information on the presence of other infections during pregnancy, such as genitourinary infections. Mean differences were adjusted for confounders but it is possible that residual confounding and confounding due to lack of variables, such as underlying conditions, is possible. Our sample, while representing a range of maternal demographic characteristics, had a higher educational attainment than the general US population. Lastly, mothers' CBCL reports could have been biased by their knowledge of infection during pregnancy, but this is unlikely given the long interval between pregnancy and CBCL completion.",

This study included a large sample of mother-offspring pairs allowing for the exploration of the role of timing, duration, and treatment of URI in relation to neurodevelopment. Additionally, mothers reported URI information through a standardized in-person interview with trained study nurses including symptoms, duration, timing, and treatment, prior to assessment of neurocognitive functioning and therefore the recall of information was not influenced by the development of neurocognitive delays in offspring. While the measures used in our analysis cannot be used to diagnoses specific disorders, we were able to detect small changes in neurodevelopment across a normative range of scores. While an average difference in test scores of just a few points may not be clinically meaningful on the individual level, a few points associated with such a ubiquitous exposure may have a large population impact.",
