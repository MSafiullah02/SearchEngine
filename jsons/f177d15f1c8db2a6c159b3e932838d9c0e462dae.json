            "text": "The recently developed Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) is a seven-item uni-dimensional scale that assesses the severity of fears of COVID-19. Given the rapid increase of COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh, we aimed to translate and validate the FCV-19S in Bangla. The forwardbackward translation method was used to translate the English version of the questionnaire into Bangla. The reliability and validity properties of the Bangla FCV-19S were rigorously psychometrically evaluated (utilizing both confirmatory factor analysis and Rasch analysis) in relation to socio-demographic variables, national lockdown variables, and response to the Bangla Health Patient Questionnaire. The sample comprised 8550 Bangladeshi participants. The Cronbach \u03b1 value for the Bangla FCV-19S was 0.871 indicating very good internal reliability. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis showed that the uni-dimensional factor structure of the FCV-19S fitted well with the data. The FCV-19S was significantly correlated with the nine-item Bangla Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-90) (r = 0.406, p < 0.001). FCV-19S scores were significantly associated with higher worries concerning lockdown. Measurement invariance of the FCV-19S showed no differences with respect to age or gender. The Bangla version of FCV-19S is a valid and reliable tool with robust psychometric properties which will be useful for researchers carrying out studies among the Bangla speaking population in assessing the psychological impact of fear from COVID-19 infection during this pandemic.",

As of April 11 (2020), 210 countries or territories had confirmed cases of COVID-19 (World Health Organization 2020) . To date, the scientific community has described the clinical course of COVID-19, counted cases and monitored its spread country-by-country, and has been trying to develop a vaccine (Dong et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020 ). However, COVID-19 has a very high infection rate and relatively high mortality rate (i.e., 3.6% and 1.5% in and outside of China respectively; Baud et al. 2020) ; individuals are quite naturally afraid of getting the virus. Additionally, death toll overestimation (Roussel et al. 2020 ) and pandemicrelated issues such as social distancing, quarantine, and isolation have amplified fears leading to stigma in several cases (Lin 2020) .",

Moreover, mental health issues (i.e., depression, stress, panic, distress, etc.) can in more extreme cases result in suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and actual suicide occurrence (Goyal et al. 2020; Mamun and Griffiths 2020a) . Indeed, Mamun and Griffiths (2020b) recently reported the first case of suicide due to the fear of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. With a mortality rate of 6.2% in Bangladesh, the number of COVID-19 cases has been rising with individuals aged between 31 and 40 years being most infected (i.e., around 22%; Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research 2020). The rapid spread of COVID-19 appears to be creating a great concern in Bangladesh and the country has had many previous instances of disaster-related psychological suffering (Mamun and Griffiths 2020c; Mamun et al. 2019) .",

Continuous data were reported as means (and SDs) and categorical data were reported as frequencies and percentages. There are two approaches for assessing psychometric characteristics of a scale: classical test theory (CTT) and modern test theory. CTT has been widely used to assess psychometric properties of various self-reported measures, and assumes that the item responses of a scale should be summed to compute a score. This score is a class true score (a representation of assessed outcome: in this study, fear). However, CTT has some limitations including (i) assuming a linear relationship between latent variables and observed scores and (ii) being dependent on sample and group. However, modern test theory such as item response theory (IRT) assumes that the relationship between latent variables and observed scores is not necessarily linear (Wirth and Edwards 2007) . Instead, it could vary from one person to another. Several statistics were performed to assess CTT including item ceiling and floor effects (the percentage of participants who obtained highest and lowest possible scores, respectively). Values lower than 50% are acceptable (Strober et al. 2013) , internal consistency (Cronbach's \u03b1 > 0.7 is acceptable), corrected item-total correlation (values > 0.4 are acceptable) (Pakpour et al. 2014) , average variance extracted (AVE; values > 0.5 indicate satisfactory convergent reliability), composite reliability (CR; values higher than 0.6 indicate acceptable reliability), standard error of measurement (smaller values indicating better reliability), and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The uni-dimensional factor stricture of the FCV-19S was evaluated using CFA with diagonally weighted least squares (WLSMV) estimator. Several indices were used to assess model fit including comparative fit index (CFI) and Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) > 0.9; root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) < 0.08; weighted root mean square residual (WRMSR) < 1.0; and non-significant chi-square (Li et al. 2017; Wu et al. 2017) .",

The first residual factor (as representative of unidimensionality) should explain more than 50% of the variance and the eigenvalues of the residuals should not be greater than 2.0 (Linacre 2012). Differential item functioning (DIF) was used to assess whether FCV-19S items are invariant across age and gender groups. A DIF value of 0.5 or higher indicates substantial DIF (i.e., invariance) across two groups. The concurrent validity was assessed by correlation (Pearson's coefficient) of the FCV-19S and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Descriptive statistics were analyzed using SPSS 24.0, CFA using MPLUS 8.0, and Rasch model using WINSTEPS 4.3.0. Table 1 . The mean age of participants was 26.5 years (SD \u00b1 9.1). Overall, 56.0% were males and 71.6% were single. Most of the participants (82.0%) were educated at tertiary level (Table 1 ). The mean, SD, skewness, and kurtosis of all items of the FCV-19S are shown in Table 2 . All items had skewness and kurtosis values within the \u00b1 2.0 range, confirming that they were normally distributed. Significant floor and ceiling effects were not observed for all items of the FCV-19S, indicating that the scale was able to detect a change of fear score ( Table 2 ). The Cronbach \u03b1 value for the Bangla FCV-19S was 0.871, indicating very good internal reliability. The corrected item-total correlations were all between 0.59 and 0.70 and positive (Table 3) .",

As to the measurement invariance, all items in the FCV-19S did not show DIF by age and gender subgroups of the participants. To determine whether there were differences between the gender group and fear scores, an independent t test was performed. The results showed that females reported significantly higher scores than males concerning fear of COVID-19 (mean = 22.75 [SD = 5.65] vs. mean = 20.29 [SD = 5.90]; t = \u2212 19.46, p < 0.001). In contrast, age did not correlate significantly with total score of the FCV-19S (r = \u2212 0.014, p = 0.186). The partial correlation coefficient showed that total score of the FCV-19S was significantly correlated with PHQ-9 (r = 0.406, p < 0.001). A possible association between fear and lockdown worries was analyzed using a multiple linear regression analysis with adjustments for age and gender as well as PHQ-9. The results showed that FCV-19S was MnSq, mean square error; DIF, differential item functioning significantly associated with higher worries concerning lockdown (standardized beta coefficient = 0.141, p < 0.001). In addition, higher scores on PHQ-9 were associated with higher worries concerning lockdown (standardized beta coefficient = 0.057, p < 0.001).",

However, factor loadings of the Bangla version of the FCV-19S were greater than those of both Iranian and Italian versions. The potential reason could be due to mean age of the sample and large sample size of the present study (N = 8677; mean age = 26.53 years, SD = 9.09) compared with the studies in Iran (N = 717; mean age = 31.25 years, SD = 12.68) and Italy (N = 249, mean age = 34.5 years, SD = 12.21; predominantly female sample). However, it can be argued that when there is a global pandemic, people at all ages feel threatened and answer questions in a similar way. Furthermore, the results obtained from the DIF analysis showed that the Bangla version of the fear questionnaire could be used in the general population irrespective of their age. In the present study, women reported higher levels of fear of COVID-19 than men. Fear can be an emotional response to an external factor. Gender differences caused by a reaction to an external threatening agent are not new. Previous studies have shown that women report more fear of contamination and disgust sensitivity than males (e.g., Olatunji et al. 2005) .",

However, the present study has some limitations. First, fear in the present study was assessed using a self-reported measure that can be influenced by factors such as social desirability, memory recall, and other common method biases. Studies using other methodologies are recommended (e.g., in-depth qualitative interviews, diary studies). Second, although a large sample size was included in the present study, the sample was a convenience sample and was not necessarily representative of the general population of Bangladesh. Future studies using nationally representative studies are needed to confirm the results reported here. Third, the study design was cross-sectional, and therefore, the associations found between variables provide little insight into causality. Future research should include longitudinal designs to assess (as aforementioned) relationships between depression and fear of COVID-19. Finally, this study did not examine the stability of the FCV-19S over time. Future research should therefore incorporate test-retest reliability measures into the design of their studies. Overall, the results of the present study showed that the Bangla version of the FCV-19S has robust psychometric properties and can be used to assess fear of COVID-19 during the pandemic among the general Bangladeshi population.",
