We must go beyond treating this illness with supportive measures and also treat the inflammatory response to the virus. We have to shift our thinking as many physicians and healthcare workers are not familiar with CRS/cytokine storm. What we know about seriously ill COVID-19 patients is that they develop a lymphopenia (low T-cell count) and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, which is likely acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS/respiratory failure) and/or heart failure. Many critical patients have elevated cardiac enzymes, inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP]), and an elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) level ( Figure 4 ). 2 Testing patients for the virus is probably not enough. Furthermore, we should also consider using other screening tools that measure inflammation such as CRP, IL-6, and ferritin levels 5 so that we can identify those patients who are at higher risk of decompensating.",

Traditionally, we have used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids to treat severe CRS in people with ARDS; however, they have not been shown to have any significant effect on outcomes. Some human immunodeficiency virus medications may be promising but similarly have not yet been proven to be effective. Biologics are likely the most useful medications in our arsenal to treat CRS/cytokine storm, as they have been shown to improve the immune response by decreasing IL-6. There are two biologic medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for anti-IL-6 therapy that may be useful for treating critical COVID-19 patients. Those medications include tocilizumab (Actemra), an antibody directed against the IL-6 receptor, and siltuximab (Sylvant), which is an anti-IL-6 chimeric monoclonal antibody. ACE inhibitors and ARB (angiotensin II receptor blockers) have also been shown to decrease IL-6 levels. 6 Recent reports indicate that the US is studying azithromycin 7 and hydroxychloroquine. 8 Both of these medications have been found to decrease IL-6 levels. Some of these medications are being investigated and used in China, 9 but as a healthcare worker in the US I have not heard that of many who are considering using medications.",
