The critical issue negotiators face during automated negotiation is that a negotiator may not always know the personality type of the opponent. Studies show that having information about the opponent improves the outcome of negotiation in general. However, unless there is prior knowledge, learning the opponent type in the limited amount of time or number of rounds in a negotiation is a difficult task. In this paper, we use a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) based modeling to perform better modeling of the opponent personality type. In particular, we focus on modeling the opponent into four different types to showcase that a better understanding of personality type can improve the outcome of automated negotiation. Our experiments performed using data sets generated from the IAGO software showcase that we indeed obtain better negotiation outcomes with a higher classification accuracy of the opponent personality type.",

In a general automated negotiation, an agent may need to negotiate with other agents or humans whose (personality) type may not be known [2, 24] . However, knowing the types of other players can provide significant advantages to the agent in many situations in terms of having a better idea of how to approach or tailor the negotiation [6, 9, 10] , potentially leading to better outcomes. The offer-counteroffer paradigm [8, 12] is a popular way of modeling automated negotiations. In this study, we deviate from the offer-counteroffer paradigm since the other negotiators can take actions for information exchange and not just to make offers and counteroffers.",

There is quite some work on modeling and prediction of opponent type in negotiation literature [1, 2] including usage of formal models such as game theory [4, 7] and Bayesian learning [26, 27] among others. However, there is relatively less work on analyzing the personality type of an opponent within the computation model of negotiation. POMDPs [11] have been used earlier in literature for modeling social interaction among humans in situations where information of the opponent has to be known [21] . More recently, preference elicitation in negotiation using the Gaussian uncertainty model has been developed in order to optimize the negotiation outcomes [14, 15] . [22] presents a POMDP based model for the development of a strategic agent for human persuasion via the usage of argumentative dialogs.",

As part of modeling the POMDP, we also need to specify an initial belief where a belief state b is defined as a probability distribution over the set of states S. Once the negotiation problem is cast into the POMDP framework, many algorithms both heuristic and exact exist in the literature to find an approximate or optimal POMDP policy [11, 20] .

Please note that the meaning/value of concession by the same amount is different across the (3) personality types; hence the reward value is modeled accordingly. For example, between the Individualist and Cooperator agents, Individualists may never want to concede, but Cooperator will tend to concede at some time steps.

In this experiment, we first make changes to the transcripts that are used to build the POMDP. In particular, we consider two setups here: Setup 1 where we (manually) change the opponent type in the first half of input transcripts where opponent type is Individualist and Setup 2 where we manually change the opponent type in the second half of transcripts where opponent type is Individualist, i.e., we introduce misclassification of opponent type in the input transcripts. For both the setups, we model two opponent types in state space i.e., value for Type in state space can be Individualist or Altruist. For both the setups we then perform three experiments: (a) Individualist correct i.e., no (manual) changes made to tran-script and reward function used is the one that corresponds to when opponent type is individualist (b) Individualist Wrong as Altruists i.e., in the manually changed transcripts when Type is Altruist, POMDP continues to use Individualist reward since Altruist was introduced via a manual change (correct reward used when Type is Individualist) and (c) Individualist-Altruist correct (POMDP uses reward for Altruist when Type is Altruist). Fig. 4 shows results for Setup 2. The x-axis for both the figures represent Timesteps while y-axis shows the EETR values. Both the figure shows that the orange line has the lowest EETR values due to the effect of type misclassification in input files as well as absence of correction in reward function, i.e., reward function used as if the misclassification was not present. The green line does better since, although misclassfication of opponent type was present, the reward function reflects this misclassification while the blue line performs best since there was no misclassfication in the input files (and hence no reward function correction is needed).",

The second belief tracking experiment tries to distinguish between opponents where one opponent is of a single personality type while the other is a combination of 3 personality types. The goal of this experiment is to observe if we can get a better accuracy result than the pair-wise comparison. Table 1 shows the classification accuracy for this experiment. We observe that there is an improvement in classification accuracy for all the four types, possibly due to the consolidation of information into two categories instead of four categories earlier.",

We focus on four personality types, in particular, namely Individualist, Cooperator, Competitor, and Altruist. We generated 30 negotiation transcripts for each type for experimentation purposes using the IAGO software. For purposes of sanity check: (a) We compared our POMDP against two MDPs, MDP1, which does not model personality type and MDP2, which knows the personality type. We found MDP1 \u2264 POMDP \u2264 MDP2 in terms of performance (b) We introduced errors in POMDP model in multiple ways and found that they result in a decrease of reward obtained by the agent. Our classification accuracy results performed in two ways, i.e., Pair-wise and One vs. Rest, both show that we obtain good quality results, which showcase that transcripts containing personality-related information can indeed help to improve automated negotiation technology.",
