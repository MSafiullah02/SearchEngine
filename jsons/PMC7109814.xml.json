            "text": "It is generally accepted that ovarian epithelial cancer arises from ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) that covers the ovary. OSE is a simple, rather primitive mesothelium with both epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics. In contrast to mesothelia elsewhere, OSE retains the properties of relatively uncommitted pluripotent cells that has the ability to differentiate diversely in response to different stimuli (2). As it progresses to malignancy, OSE becomes more committed to an epithelial phenotype of the Mullerian duct in association with increased E-cadherin expression than to undergo epithelial\u2013mesenchymal conversion (2,3). This unique characteristic distinguishes ovarian cancers from other cancers, which usually become less differentiated than the epithelium from which they arise during tumorigenesis and lose E-cadherin expression with progression (4). Moreover, ovarian cancers can metastasize by exfoliating small nodules of cohesive tumor cells from the primary tumor into the peritoneal cavity. Tumor cells can often aggregate and form spheroid-like structures that subsequently implant and invade into peritoneal tissue through E-cadherin-mediated adherens junction (3\u20137).",

In mammals, there are three HH ligand proteins: Sonic hedgehog (Shh), Indian HH and Desert HH. In the absence of ligands, the pathway is inactive. The transmembrane protein receptor Patched functions as a tumor suppressor that inhibits Smoothened (Smo) from activating downstream signaling components and Gli-mediated transcription of target genes (17,18). Activation of the pathway is initiated through binding of any of the three ligands (Shh, Indian HH, Desert HH) to Patched, alleviating Patched-mediated suppression of Smo and activating a signal cascade that leads to the translocation of active form of Gli, a zinc finger transcriptional factor, to the nucleus and further activates targeting genes expression (17,18). Aberrant activation of HH pathway is caused through sustained increased endogenous expression of HH (ligand-dependent) or by ligand-independent mutations of Patched, Smo and Suppressor of fused in the pathway (19,20).",

Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed that after KAAD-cyclopamine blocking, significant downregulation of E-cadherin transcripts concurred with downregulation of the target gene Gli1 mRNA (Figure 6D). Furthermore, E-cadherin promoter activity was decreased by 2- to 5-folds compared with Tomatidine-treated control (Figure 6D), suggesting that E-cadherin activity can be inactivated at transcriptional level after inhibition of the pathway.

In the current study, besides confirming the increased expression of Shh, Patched, Smo and Gli1 proteins in borderline tumors compared with benign ovarian tumors as reported by Chen et al.

In our study, the correlation of Gli1 overexpression and poor survival can be explained by the cell proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis-promoting effect and apoptosis-inhibiting effect of Gli1 overexpression. Such changes were associated with increased expression of VEGF, MT1-MMP and \u03b21 integrin, which play critical roles in ovarian carcinogenesis (5,41,42). MT1-MMP is the critical determinant of matrix degradation and invasion in ovarian cancer cells, whereas integrins play important roles in the metastatic process through their participation in both cell\u2013cell contacts and interactions with a large variety of extracellular matrix protein (43). VEGF is thought to contribute to ovarian tumor progression by stimulating angiogenesis and to promote ascites accumulation by increasing the permeability of diaphragmatic and tumor-associated vasculature (44). Overexpression of Gli1 in cancer cells also induced increased expression of Bcl-2. It is known that Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic gene and is an important chemotherapy-resistant factor (45). Overexpression of Bcl-2 may result in accumulation of cells in the G0 phase of cell cycle division and contribute to chemoresistance (45). Thus, aberrant activation of HH may result in cancer cell resistance to apoptosis through participation of death receptor pathway.",

Peritoneal ovarian cancer spheroids have been shown to be protected from apoptosis induced by radiation and therapeutic drugs (46).

It is known that increased expression of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 causes resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs and radiation therapy, whereas decreased Bcl-2 may promote apoptotic responses to anticancer drug (45). Even though increased expression of cleaved form of caspase 7 and PARP was observed in OVCAR3 cells, OVCAR3 was quite resistant regarding effect on cancer cell apoptosis probably due to high expression of Bcl-2 or other genetic alterations despite of elevated Gli1 expression. OVCA433 cell line is the cell line most sensitive to KAAD-cyclopamine-induced apoptosis and cell growth inhibition. The nature of this sensitivity may be related to its very low expression of Bcl-2.",

Decreased expression of E-cadherin, cytokeratin 7, Snail, vimentin and calretinin was observed. These findings were different from mesenchymal\u2013epithelial transition observed in pancreatic cancer cells after the same treatment (11). Instead, such changes may reflect regression to a more primitive pluripotent phenotype.

Transcriptional factor Snail is one of the repressors of E-cadherin gene expression, which in turn controls epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transitions (51,52). Snail is also an early Gli1-responsive gene in the skin and Gli1 can directly induce Snail transcription (53). Induction of a conditional Gli1 transgene in the basal keratinocytes of mouse skin led to rapid upregulation of Snail transcripts and to cell proliferation in the interfollicular epidermis. Established Gli1-induced skin lesions exhibited molecular similarities to basal cell carcinoma, including loss of E-cadherin expression mediated by the Snail (54). However, in our current study, E-cadherin was only expressed in ovarian cancer cell lines instead of normal epithelial cell lines, whereas Snail expression was present in both cancer and normal cell lines without big difference. After treatment with KAAD-cyclopamine, decreased expression of E-cadherin was observed in association with decreased rather than increased Snail expression in SKOV3 cells. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of Gli1 in SKOV3 cells induced increased expression of E-cadherin, whereas no significant change in Snail expression was found, suggesting that Gli1-related E-cadherin expression in ovarian cancer may be regulated through Snail-independent mechanisms.",

Since Gli1 is a sequence-specific DNA binding protein that interacts with the motif (5\u2032-GACCACCCA-3\u2032) and there is no binding site within the 1359 bp of E-cadherin promoter (55,56), the up- or downregulated E-cadherin transcriptional activity may be due to indirect effects of Gli1 expression possibly through other activators or repressors. After transfection of Gli1 into SKOV3, only the shorter promoter constructs E-Cad37 and E-Cad108 were associated with increased activity, whereas the longer E-Cad368 and E-Cad1359 had no response. It is possible that the transcriptional repressor binding sites are located upstream of the more proximal E-cadherin promoter elements. Increased expression of E-cadherin might also be mediated through demethylation of CpG dinucleotide of the E-cadherin promoter. Further studies are needed to explore the underlying mechanisms.",
