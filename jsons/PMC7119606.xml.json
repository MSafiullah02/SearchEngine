            "text": "Nitric oxide (NO) production in the CNS results from the activity of nitric oxide synthases (NOS), of which three isoforms have been identified to date. These enzymes vary in their cellular distribution and regulation. Constitutively expressed NOS types I and III have relatively restricted cellular distributions in the CNS to neurons and endothelial cells, respectively, and their activities are regulated by intracellular calcium levels. These isoforms are thought to synthesize NO important for such physiological processes as intercellular signalling and vasoregulation. In contrast, CNS cells do not express NOS type II (also referred to as inducible or iNOS) unless appropriately activated (Simmons and Murphy, 1992; Corradin et al., 1993; Nunokawa et al., 1993; Minc-Golomb et al., 1994; Borgerding and Murphy, 1995). Common to all cells presently described which express NOS II in vitro is the requirement for transcriptional induction by exposure to specific proinflammatory cytokines or bacterial endotoxins. Cellular release of NO with NOS II expression is, therefore, thought to be important primarily under pathophysiological conditions when such inducers are present, for example in CNS infections.",

            "text": "A detailed understanding of the immune mechanisms responsible for viral clearance and for persistent viral infection in the CNS is currently lacking. Increasing evidence has accumulated to support the idea that activation of NOS II expression and NO production is an important component in the immune response to specific CNS infections, possibly contributing to the resulting pathology (Cross et al., 1993; Koprowski et al., 1993; Campbell et al., 1994; Dighiero et al., 1994; Van Dam et al., 1995). Phagocytic cells expressing NOS II and producing NO have been shown to be cytotoxic for cells infected with intracellular pathogens (Adams et al., 1990; Chao et al., 1993; Vouldoukis et al., 1995) and murine macrophages induced with interferon (IFN)-g to express NOS II have been shown to inhibit replication of ectromelia, vaccinia, and herpes simplex-1 viruses in vitro (Karupiah et al., 1993). Recently, productive Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) infection has been shown to be inhibited in a susceptible neuronal cell line by exposure to NO (Bi and Reiss, 1995). Additionally, a conducive environment for NOS II induction is created with acute and chronic viral CNS infections. Production of a variety of cytokines by exogenous and endogenous cells occurs in increased amounts, including IFN-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, and interleukin (IL)-1 (Frei et al., 1988; Benveniste, 1992; Schneider-Schaulies et al., 1993). The release of NO with acute and chronic viral infection may, therefore, function protectively to clear virus from the CNS. However, since the cytotoxic effects of NO (or of peroxynitrite, formed by its interaction with superoxide anion) are non-specific, NOS II induction in the CNS could have detrimental or lethal effects, not only on invading pathogens and infected cells but also on nearby uninfected endogenous cells (Chao et al., 1992; Merrill et al., 1993; Dawson et al., 1994; Hewett et al., 1994). Such nonspecific cytotoxicity may be particularly important in the cellular mechanisms responsible for CNS damage and dysfunction following infection by viruses that are neither cytolytic nor infective of neurons (Koprowski, 1994).",

The outcome of infection with this virus in mice depends on the route of inoculation, genetic susceptibility, and host immune response (Compton et al., 1993). Acute CNS infection with this virus in susceptible animals results in lytic infection of a variety of endogenous parenchymal cells, producing a rapidly fatal meningoencephalitis. Previous studies have reported the importance of CD4+ and CD8+ cell infiltration in the clearance of MHV virus, with cytokines as possible mediators (Sussman et al., 1989; Williamson and Stohlman, 1990; Korner et al., 1991; Yamaguchi et al., 1991; Pearce et al., 1994).",

These observations suggest that NOS II induction and NO release may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease; however, in this rapidly progessive infection it is more likely that CNS dysfunction is a result of neuronal and general parenchymal damage caused directly by the virus. Non-specific cytotoxic effects on cells adjacent to infiltrated macrophages in acute MHV-JHM infection may produce some CNS damage. This would be expected since activated phagocytes also produce superoxide anion which could interact with NO to produce peroxynitrite. However, the observation that significant numbers of NOS II positive macrophages are present in the brain parenchyma only at late stages of the disease when extensive CNS damage has already occurred, suggests that the amount of NO-associated injury is probably not enough to significantly alter the course of the disease. One would predict, therefore, that administration of a specific NOS II inhibitor would not affect the clinical course of this acute infection. Infiltrating macrophages also express NOS II in Borna and Rabies encephalitides, but in these cases the NO released is thought to contribute significantly to CNS damage and therefore clinical disease (Zheng et al., 1993; Van Dam et al., 1995).",

These observations could be explained by the sensitivity limit of the assay; it is possible that neurons, glia, or other cells may be producing low levels of NOS II which are undetectable by immunohistochemistry. This explanation is not likely since NOS II was demonstrated in endogenous cells with persistent infection. Alternatively, it may take longer than expected (based on in vitro data) to induce astrocytes or other CNS cells to express NOS II in vivo. More likely, a complex system of regulation for NOS II expression by soluble mediators and/or virus may exist in vivo. Therefore, NO release does not appear to be a component of the innate immune response to acute infection with this virus or to play a significant role in viral clearance. This is unlike Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV) infection, in which infiltrating macrophages also express NOS II. Here, administration of antimacrophage agents before LCMV infection results in a significant increase and prolongation of viremia, suggesting a role for macrophage NO release in clearance of virus (Cross et al., 1993).",

In contrast to acute infection these astrocytes express NOS II, suggesting that virus-infected cells may be transcriptionally induced in an effort to clear virus. Upregulation of NOS II transcription may be stimulated either directly by virus or after exposure to proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1) released locally by other infected or activated cells. The ongoing presence of virus in the spinal cord with demyelination indicates that, if NOS II induction with NO release is an anti-viral defense mechanism under these conditions, it is not entirely successful; however, NO cytotoxicity may significantly limit an infection which would otherwise be overwhelming. In vitro studies are needed to clarify whether astrocytes can be induced to express NOS II and release NO in response to persistent MHV-JHM viral infection alone, but our observations suggest this as a possibility.",

Under these conditions, it has been hypothesized that NOS II induction and sustained NO release could mediate the destruction of myelin and oligodendrocytes via a `bystander' effect and/or by raising intracellular levels of cGMP which increases the susceptibility of cells to TNF-a toxicity (Sherman et al., 1992). Astrocytic expression of NOS II in demyelinated lesions from persistently infected animals supports this hypothesis. Therefore, the administration of a specific NOS II inhibitor might be predicted to prevent or ameliorate development of pathological changes in the spinal cord and clinical symptoms in mice with persistent infection, as reported by Cross et al. (1993)for experimental allergic encephalomyelitis.",

Due to the relatively late temporal expression of NOS II, this NO release probably does not contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of acute disease. In contrast, NOS II expression and NO release may be a component of the innate immune response to persistent MHV-JHM infection and, via a `bystander' effect, contribute to CNS injury. The lack of specific NOS II inhibitors has so far precluded definitive testing of this hypothesis. However, the availability of NOS II-deficient mice (MacMicking et al., 1995; Wei et al., 1995) now provides an opportunity to clarify roles for NOS II induction and NO release in MHV-JHM and other CNS viral diseases.",
