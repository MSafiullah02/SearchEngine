He had a Glenn procedure performed at 1 year of life, with surgical anastomosis of the right SVC to the pulmonary artery. The final cardiac surgical procedure was a lateral tunnel Fontan (IVC to pulmonary artery) performed at 4 yrs. of life. He had undergone a cardiac catheterization for systemic desaturation as a child with device closure of a large veno-venous collateral from the azygous to the left upper pulmonary vein. He had stenosis of the IVC pathway of the Fontan circuit which was treated with balloon dilation and stent placement. A work-up for recurrent epistaxis revealed a sino-nasal mass. He underwent endoscopic resection and embolization of bilateral maxillary arteries with coils and onyx through the external carotid artery.

            "text": "Though Fontan patients commonly have lower oxygen saturations between 90-95% in room air, it is important to consider other possible etiologies of systemic oxygen desaturation in a Fontan patient. One reason of baseline desaturation includes markedly deoxygenated coronary sinus vein blood that typically drains into the pulmonary venous chamber and mixes with pulmonary venous blood. Due to absent sub-pulmonic pumping ventricle, the non-pulsatile pulmonary artery blood flow tends to gravitate in lower lung segment whereas the pulmonary aeration favors upper segments resulting in ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Other differential diagnoses for desaturation in a Fontan patient include veno-venous collaterals leading to right to left shunting which allows dexogeynated venous blood to mix with oxygenated arterial blood. These veno-venous collaterals may naturally form as a \"pop-off\", between the high-pressure systemic venous and lower-pressure pulmonary venous chambers. These communications may develop over time, either within the heart or through extra-cardiac venous collaterals (1) . Another cause of desaturation in patients with Fontan circulation, notably those with heterotaxy syndrome is from development of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVM) causing intra-pulmonary shunting and progressive cyanosis (2) . Some Fontan patients develop plastic bronchitis caused by the spillage of protein-rich lymph through lymphatic-to-bronchial communications, which can present with productive cough, dyspnea and hypoxemia (3) . Other causes of systemic oxygen desaturation are not exclusive to patients with single ventricles, include causes that lead to hypoventilation or V/Q mismatch due to pulmonary embolism, pneumonias, asthma or COPD.",

This is the first case report of an adult congenital heart disease patient with single Another important aspect of COVID-19 is the presence of abnormal coagulation profile, leading to formation of micro-thrombi, and when combined in a patient with low flow circuit like Fontan circulation the outcomes can be catastrophic. The incidence of venous thromboembolism among COVID-19 patients in critically sick patients who are in the Intensive Care Unit appears to be somewhat higher compared to that reported in other studies including such patients with other disease conditions. D-dimer might help in early recognition of these high-risk patients and also predict outcome. Our patient did not have elevated D-dimer through his admission. There is also preliminary data in patients with severe COVID-19, anticoagulant therapy appears to be associated with lower mortality in the subpopulation meeting sepsis-induced coagulopathy criteria or with markedly elevated d-dimer (9) . The predominant predisposing factor is venous stasis which is often evident in the cavo-pulmonary circuit in light of the absence of a pump for systemic venous return and pulmonary blood flow. It is now well known, that adult patients with Fontan palliation should be considered for long term anticoagulation (10) .",

At this time, all current management strategies are extrapolated from what is known about the effect of COVID-19 on adult patients with cardiovascular disease. Efforts are underway through the Adult Congenital Heart Association and the International Society of Adult Congenital Heart Disease to gather data on the number of suspected and confirmed cases both in the United States and globally and to better understand outcomes in this population 3 . Our patient was diagnosed with moderate COVID-19 disease due to his oxygen saturations < 94%, however it is important to consider baseline hypoxia in a certain type of congenital heart defect and hence prevent inaccurate classification of these patients. The elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are consistent with underlying chronic hypoxia as a compensatory mechanism. Based on the ACHD Anatomy and Physiological Stage Classification, any patient with complex congenital heart disease (Anatomy Stage III) which includes Fontan patients, cyanotic congenital heart defect (unrepaired or palliated, all forms), single ventricle, pulmonary atresia (all forms) should be could be considered high risk for complications related to COVID-19 infection on the basis of decreased functional reserve (4,3) . In circumstances when patients are admitted, the treatment management should include symptomatic support, management of respiratory failure and other signs end-organ damage. There are no effective therapies for COVID-19 at this point, and trial of medications including anti-virals and other drugs like hydroxychloroquine, caution must be used while using them in patients with congenital heart disease. Clinicians must assess the potential risk versus the uncertain benefits for each individual patient. In cases of mild disease, the patients can be managed by non-invasive forms of supplemental oxygen support. However, patients with severe COVID-19 disease have findings similar to ARDS and often require intubation for improving oxygenation and ventilation. This can be challenging in Fontan patients, as positive pressure ventilation causing increased intrathoracic pressure leading to deleterious effects on the intrapulmonary and intracardiac hemodynamics with decreased pre-load and ultimately decreased systemic cardiac output. If intubated, the PEEP should be within the range to maintain functional residual capacity of the lung, avoid atelectasis and hypoxia related vasoconstriction. Higher PEEP (9-12cm H 2 O) have been associated with decreased cardiac index (4). Low respiratory rates, short inspiratory times, low PEEP, and tidal volumes of 5-6 ml/ kg usually allow adequate pulmonary blood flow, normocarbia, and a low pulmonary vascular resistance. Some studies have shown improvement in exercise capacity and hemodynamics with pulmonary vasodilator therapies for patients with Fontan circulation (5). As recently reported by Zhang et al., considering the biochemical parameters, elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6), neutrophilia and lymphocytopenia (as well as low CD3 + and CD4 + T-cell counts) seem to be correlated to the most severe cases of the infection (6). Studies have demonstrated a strong correlation between hypertension and Nitric Oxide (NO), where a high level of blood pressure is a pathological condition characterized by endothelial dysfunction, in which NO availability is impaired with concomitant increased release of IL-6 by the dysfunctional endothelium (7). Extrapolating from the previous points, COVID19 virus could determine a more severe cytokines storm (with very high levels of IL-6, but low T cells) in those patients where the basal levels of cytokines (i.e. IL-6) are higher and NO levels are lower (8). This may be reflective of this patient who had significantly elevated IL-6 levels. Starting from these considerations and focusing attention on the role of IL-6 and NO, we can postulate a possible role for the phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5-i), such as Sildenafil Citrate or Tadalafil, in increasing the levels of NO. Considering the biochemical mechanisms involved in COVID19 infection and previous experiences justifying the off-label use of Sildenafil Citrate (or similar) as anti-viral drugs, a possible synergic role of PDE5-i as early complimentary drug in the treatment of COVID19 infection should be considered.",
