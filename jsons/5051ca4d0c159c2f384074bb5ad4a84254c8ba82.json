In the intensive care unit (ICU), it is often performed in patients with acute respiratory failure. The main risk brought by fiberoptic bronchoscopy in the critically ill is the worsening of hypoxemia [2] [3] [4] , but in the few studies focused on fiberoptic bronchoscopy tolerance and comprising a significant number of BAL performed in ICU patients, BAL has been considered well tolerated in most of the cases [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Meanwhile, as less invasive diagnostic methods exist or are emerging (high-resolution CT scan imaging, molecular microbiological diagnosis on nasopharyngeal swab, or on tracheal aspirates, etc.), the real utility of BAL for the diagnosis of pulmonary diseases encountered in the ICU may be questioned. In immunocompromised patients who represent a large proportion of patients undergoing BAL in the ICU, the diagnostic yield of BAL was reported to be rather low compared to a less invasive approach [12] . Therefore, estimating the benefit-to-risk balance of BAL in the critically ill would be an appreciable adjunct for decision making, when BAL is envisaged.",

The physician's experience in terms of years in the specialty (< 5; 5-10; > 10 years) and of number of BAL performed (< 30; 30-50; > 50) was recorded. We defined the physician performing the BAL as an \"experienced physician\" when he/she was a pulmonologist or when he/ she was an intensivist with the greatest experience (i.e., > 10 years in the specialty or > 50 BAL performed), considering that pulmonologists, by virtue of their specialty, are sufficiently trained in the practice of BAL. We collected patients' characteristics at inclusion, including demographics, time spent in ICU before BAL, existence of acute respiratory failure before BAL or not, according to the attending intensivist's judgment, Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPSII) [13] , tobacco use, underlying respiratory diseases, immunosuppression, and use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy. We recorded the indication(s) of BAL, vital signs before BAL (respiratory rate [RR], heart rate [HR], blood pressure [BP]), and arterial blood gases, blood lactate, and pulse oximetry (SpO 2 ) within the past 6 h. Type of respiratory support used, body temperature, BP, HR, RR, and SpO 2 were collected at the beginning of bronchoscopy and at 1, 6, 12, and 24 h, thereafter. The amounts of fluid instilled for BAL and recovered were recorded. If sampled, arterial blood gases corresponding to the lowest PaO 2 /inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO 2 ) ratio within 24 h after BAL were also recorded. For patients under oxygen therapy other than high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC), the FiO 2 value was derived from oxygen flow rate [14] .",

In counterpart, HFNC therapy has been shown safer than NIV in patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure [19] and has the advantage to be easy to use for care providers. This probably explains the predominant use of HFNC therapy in our study cohort. However, while some recent studies suggested that HFNC is safe for performing fiberoptic bronchoscopy and BAL [20] [21] [22] , large randomized trials are still needed.",

This discrepancy may be due to differences in methods used for collecting and defining adverse events. However, while the non-comparative design of this study does not allow firm conclusions regarding the cause-effect relationship between BAL and the collected adverse events, the high frequency of adverse events should prompt caution when performing BAL in ICU patients, especially in non-intubated patients. The high frequency of adverse events might account for the increased hospital mortality recently observed in non-ventilated immunocompromised patients who underwent a bronchoscopy as compared to those who did not [23] . Given the high frequency of adverse events we observed in non-ventilated Table S6 in Online Resource 1) was used. The amount of BAL fluid recovered was transformed in cubic splines to account for non-linearity. The biphasic shape of the figure shows that below 60 mL of BAL fluid recovered, the estimated probability declines in parallel with the amount of fluid recovered patients, one may wonder if systematically intubating the sickest patients (e.g., those with profound hypoxemia) could not be a safer option for performing BAL. However, although this is a common concern in ICUs, to our knowledge, no comparative trial has yet been conducted to answer this question. It is worth noting that in the few available prospective studies focused on BAL tolerance that showed rather low adverse event rate [6] [7] [8] , bronchoscopies and BAL were mostly performed by pulmonologists [6] or by experienced ICU physicians [7, 8] . The present study highlights the importance of the physician's experience and training, which have often been emphasized in recommendations [2, 24, 25] for bronchoscopy but have never been demonstrated for ICU patients undergoing BAL so far. Although we could not show a direct link between the quality of the BAL fluid recovered and the diagnostic yield of BAL, the fact that the variable \"experienced physician\" was also a strong predictor of a BAL of good quality suggests that the greater the experience of the physician performing the BAL, the better the chance of performing a safe and useful BAL.",

            "text": "Previous studies have reported that the diagnostic yield of BAL was within the range of 34-59% in ICU patients [8, 11, 12] . In line with these results, using a pragmatical classification in an unselected population, we found that the BAL showed good usefulness for decision making in one half of the cases. Additionally, we found that the BAL input for decision making was not easily predictable. This uncertainty associated with the BAL input for decision making again justifies the caution with which BAL should be performed to ensure the best possible benefit-to-risk balance. Although the BAL usefulness of 47% observed in this study may appear rather low compared to the number of adverse events brought about, it should be placed in perspective with other diagnostic, invasive procedures such as open lung biopsy. In a recent meta-analysis in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients [26] , open lung biopsy was reported to yield definitive diagnosis in nearly 100% of the cases, allowing to change therapy in 73%, while causing complications in 22%, resulting in a more favorable benefit-to-harm ratio than the one we observed for BAL. However, great variability of diagnostic yield (40-100%), impact on therapy (40-100%) and complications (0-60%) of lung biopsy existed between the published cohort studies [26] , preventing any definitive conclusion. Moreover, as those studies were mostly retrospective, it is highly probable that many adverse events were not collected. Therefore, prospective studies that could help in deciding which procedure is riskier or more beneficial to patients are still lacking. In addition, although open lung biopsy may have proved beneficial to some immunosuppressed patients such as after bone marrow transplantation [27] , it cannot reasonably be offered to all patients for whom BAL currently appears to be the most appropriate diagnostic tool, either because it may be disproportionate for patients with low severity of disease or because surgical procedures are a real challenge for cancer patients with pancytopenia. Undoubtedly, if there is one alternative to the BAL that could be less risky for immunosuppressed patients, it is the combination of non-invasive tests on sputum, nasopharyngeal secretions, urine, and blood that may dramatically restrict the number of patients for whom BAL is absolutely needed [12] . This might become increasingly true in view of the current development of molecular diagnostic tools [28] [29] [30] , the knowledge acquired in chest highresolution computed tomography imaging [31, 32] , and perhaps future progress in the human volatilome analysis [33] .",

            "text": "This study has several limitations. First, because we did not study any control group in parallel, the adverse events collected cannot be attributed to bronchoscopy or to the BAL with certainty. However, all the events collected are known side effects of bronchoscopy or BAL and the close temporal relationship between BAL and adverse events suggests that a non-negligible part of these events were related to the BAL. Second, we did not record the anesthesia regimen used during bronchoscopy and could not differentiate local from general anesthesia. Some adverse events (e.g., hypotension) probably were side effects of intravenous anesthesia. Anyway, our aim was to record, in real-life conditions, adverse events possibly related to the BAL procedure, of which anesthesia is an integral part [2] . Conversely, the occurrence of adverse events such as hypertension, agitation, cough, or bronchospasm, at least in intubated patients, may reflect suboptimal anesthesia and leaves room for improvement. This suggests that in addition to an experienced physician performing the BAL, the systematic presence of a second physician adjusting anesthesia, adapting ventilatory support and taking care of the hemodynamic status, might improve the patient safety. Third, as there are no published specific classifications of adverse events and of diagnostic yield of BAL, we used our own classifications. Regarding the adverse events (Table 1) , it is noteworthy that the main predictor of adverse events identified (non-experienced physician performing a BAL in a non-intubated patient), not only was strongly associated with grade 3 adverse events, but also by proportional odds model analysis was associated with an increased probability of observing any grade of adverse event above a certain value versus observing any grade of adverse event below the same value. In our view, this would tend to validate the adverse events classification we proposed. Fourth, we used a \"home-made\" classification of the BAL input for decision making. This may have introduced bias in the estimation of the diagnostic yield of BAL. In particular for the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia, it is possible that the culture of the BAL fluid identified a microorganism already identified by other means (e.g., tracheal aspirate with semi-quantitative culture) and did not lead to modification of the antibiotic regimen already in place. Although some may argue that in this case the diagnostic yield of BAL might have been declared as very good, there is an ongoing debate about the bacteriological samples to be used for accurately diagnosing ventilatorassociated pneumonia [34, 35] . Also, in some instances despite no formal respiratory diagnosis was retained, the input of BAL was classified as Class 5 (i.e., the best possible) by the attending intensivists, because BAL not only has allowed ruling out some diagnoses, but also allowed trying another treatment such as diuretics or corticosteroids. This may have slightly distorted the classification of the BAL input. Fifth, in the French ICUs involved in this study, the bronchoscopy and BAL could be performed either by pulmonologists or intensivists. Therefore, our results may not be found in countries, where performing bronchoscopy is a prerogative exclusively reserved for pulmonologists.",

On the other hand, the diagnostic yield of BAL could be considered satisfactory in less than one half of the cases. Altogether, these findings call for an extreme caution when considering the indication of BAL in ICU patients and for a mandatory accompaniment of the less experienced physicians.",
