            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a life-threatening form of atypical pneumonia that emerged in Guangdong Province, China, resulting in 8098 probable cases and 774 deaths around the world. A number of laboratories worldwide have undertaken the identification of the causative agent (Drosten et al., 2003, Fouchier et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003). The SARS\u2013CoV genome is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA, classified within the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, genus coronavirus of \u223c29.7 kb and contains 14 open reading frames. The genome is composed of a stable region encoding functional replicase/transcriptase complex, a variable region representing four coding sequences for viral structural proteins (spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N)), and other putative nonstructural uncharacterized proteins. The gene order of SARS\u2013CoV is similar to that of other coronaviruses; however, phylogenic analyses and sequence comparisons indicate that this virus does not closely resemble any of the previously known human or animal coronaviruses (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003, Ruan et al., 2003). Later study suggests that SARS\u2013CoV represents an early split-off from coronavirus group 2 lineage relatively late in coronavirus evalution (Snijder et al., 2003) and this result has found support from other studies using alternative methods (Gorbalenya et al., 2004, Stavrinides and Guttman, 2004).",

Recently is has been reported to be phosphoraylated in vitro (Zakhartchouk et al., 2005) although the physiological consequence of such covalent modification is yet to be determined. A recent report showed that phosphorylation of coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) N protein determined the recognition of virus RNA (Chen et al., 2005). In addition, serine/arginine rich (SR; aa176\u2013204) motif, which present in SARS\u2013CoV N, may be the site for the location of phosphoserines. Based on the available information, several functions have been postulated for the coronavirus N proteins throughout the virus life cycle (Laude and Masters, 1995), including viral packaging (Davies et al., 1981), viral core formation (He et al., 2004b, Risco et al., 1996) and signal transduction pathway (He et al., 2003) or part of host defense response invoked to counteract viral infection (Chang et al., 2004).",

            "text": "Sub-cellular localization of the viral protein is one of the commonly used approaches to characterize the involvement of the protein in the virus assembly. Although the SARS\u2013CoV N protein harbors a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) (Marra et al., 2003), the N protein is distributed predominantly in the cytoplasm of SARS\u2013CoV-infected and N gene-transfected cells with a presence of weak fluorescence signals in the nucleus (Chang et al., 2004), therefore, it is not known whether this putative NLS is functional or not. Moreover, Qinfen and coworkers observed a special phenomenon during morphogenesis of SARS\u2013CoV, where virus-like particles appeared in the nucleus of Vero E6 cells 48 h post-infection (Qinfen et al., 2004). On the other hand, an identical nucleolar-cytoplasmic localization pattern is observed for the N proteins of arteriviruses; porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and equine arteritis virus (EAV) (Rowland et al., 1999, Tijms et al., 2002) and for N proteins of groups I, II and III coronaviruses; transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and IBV, respectively (Hiscox et al., 2001, Wurm et al., 2001). Recently Rowland and Yoo have reported the nucleolar-cytoplasmic shuttling of PRRSV N protein through determining a possible nuclear export signal (NES) (Rowland and Yoo, 2003).",

Targeting a protein to the nucleolus occurs through the diffusion of protein through the nucleoplasm and accumulation in the nucleolus. Localization to the nucleolus is mediated through nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) that is in part an NLS, which functions by interacting with nucleolar components such as nucleolar proteins, rRNA or rDNA (Garcia-Bustos et al., 1991). Since many endogenous proteins that localize in the nucleus have been identified as regulators of the cell cycle (Chen et al., 2002, Garcia-Bustos et al., 1991) this beneficial control over the host cell cycle can either facilitate the early release of progeny virus or help the emerging virus to evade the host immune system for its persistent infection.",

The amino acid sequence analysis of N protein was done by using software program PSORT II (Nakai and Kanehisa, 1992) and three classical putative NLS motifs were identified, labeled NLS1, NLS2 and NLS3 at positions 38\u201344, 257\u2013265 and 369\u2013390 amino acids, respectively (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, a Kyte\u2013Doolittle hydrophilicity analysis of the protein sequence predicted that NLS motifs are in hydrophilic regions and should be easily accessible. An indirect immunofluorescence assay was used to analyze the intracellular localization of N protein in Vero E6 cells using anti-N polyclonal antibody. All the slides were further stained with PI to visualize the nuclear DNA. The differentially fluorescing images were gathered separately and then digitally superimposed (Fig. 4\nA\u2013H). Vero E6 cells transfected with mutant N176\u2013422, which contains NLS1, NLS2 and SR rich motifs were showed a localization pattern similar to the wild type protein (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, mutated protein N226\u2013422 (contains putative NLS2 and NLS3) was localized to the cytoplasm and nucleus accumulated mainly in the nucleolus (bright fluorescence spot inside the nucleus; Fig. 4D). The deletion mutant N226\u2013300 lacking both the NLS1 and NLS3 was also localized to the cytoplasm and the nucleolus (Fig. 4E). To further confirm this, deletion mutant N226\u2013422/\u0394369\u2013376 was constructed with internal deletion of the core basic sequence of NLS3 (369-PKKDKKKK) showed a pattern of intranuclear localization similar to N226\u2013422 and N226\u2013300 (Fig. 4F). Furthermore, the deletion mutant N335\u2013422, which contains NLS3, the highest content of basic residues among the three NLS motifs, was unexpectedly present in the cytoplasm only (Fig. 4G). The deletion mutant N1\u2013225 included the NLS1 and SR-rich motifs was localized to the cytoplasm and nucleus but the accumulation in the nucleolus could not be confirmed (Fig. 4B) because the FITC fluorescence was weak even after the experiment was repeated more than once and this could be due to the low antigenicity of the N-terminal of N protein in comparison with C-terminal (personal observation).",

            "text": "Various deletion mutants of EGFP fusion protein genes were constructed (Fig. 6\n) to study the intracellular localization pattern in another cell line, Vero cells. To eliminate the possibility that positively charged proteins may relocate to the nucleus because of a post-fixation artifact (Lundberg and Johansson, 2002), the coverslips containing cells were overlaid on the slides then directly visualized under confocal microscopy. Our results showed that the wild type EGFP was diffusely localized to the cytoplasm, nucleoplasm and excluded from the nucleolus (Fig. 7\nA) which is consistent with passive diffusion. The fusion of N protein to EGFP (GN1\u2013422) altered the distribution of EGFP, resulting in the accumulation of fluorescent protein in the cytoplasm and exclusion from the nucleus (Fig. 7B). The similar observation for the wild type EGFP-N was observed in GN176\u2013422 mutant fragment whereas in few cells a weak fluorescence was also observed in the nucleus (Fig. 7G). The protein products of mutants GN226\u2013422(Fig. 7H and I), GN226\u2013300(Fig. 7J) and GN226\u2013422/\u0394369\u2013376(Fig. 7M and N) were accumulated in the cytoplasm and nucleus and had high amounts of fluorescence intensity in the nucleolus. Further deletion from the C-terminal of GN226\u2013300 to generate GN226\u2013289 (Fig. 7K and L) fragment was still localized to the nucleolus. The Nucleoli, when viewed under phase-contrast microscope, are apparent as highly refractive bodies within the nucleus (Fig. 7C, F, I, L, N, Q and T). The GN335\u2013422 fragment was localized in the cytoplasm only (Fig. 7O) which was similar to the localization pattern for N335\u2013422. Interestingly, deletion of 24 amino acids from N-terminal and 33 amino acids from the C-terminal of GN336\u2013422 to generate GN360\u2013389 altered the distribution of EGFP, resulting in accumulation of fluorescent protein in the nucleus and its decrease in the cytoplasm (Fig. 7P and Q). This showed that the peptide region 360\u2013389 contains an active NLS3. Furthermore, GN1\u2013175 and GN1\u2013225 mutant fragments contain NLS1 and NLS1 and SR rich motifs respectively, were localized in the nucleus but excluded from the nucleolus (Fig. 7D and (E and F) respectively) suggesting that N-terminal N protein may also contain an active NLS1 that directs an exogenous protein to the nucleus but not to the nucleolus. These results showed that the region aa226\u2013289 of the N protein contains NoLS and thus its activity is independent from putative NLS1 and NLS3.",

To address this question, we performed amino acid sequence analysis of the of N protein and showed that it contains LRR (220-LALLLLDRLNRL-231; Fig. 3A) which satisfies the consensus requirements for the classical NES; X-R(2\u20134)-X-R2-X-R-X, where X is leucine, isoleucine or valine and R is any amino acid (Henderson and Eleftheriou, 2000, Hope, 1999). Furthermore, Kyte\u2013Doolittle hydrophilicity analysis showed that this region has highest hydrophobicity. To determine if the N protein LLR sequence is functional, different deletion mutants were constructed, N\u0394220\u2013231 and GN\u0394220\u2013231. These mutants contain the full length N protein with an internal deletion of LRR (Fig. 3, Fig. 6), cloned to pcDNA3 and pEGFP-N1, respectively. In addition, the peptide aa220\u2013231 was placed at the C-terminal of EGFP to produce GN220\u2013231. The Vero cells transfected with mutant plasmids were examined by indirect immnuofluorescence using rabbit anti-N polyclonal antibody or direct fluorescence for EGFP fusion mutant fragments. The N\u0394220\u2013231 localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus mainly in the nucleolus similar to the localization pattern of N226\u2013300 (Fig. 4H). The localization pattern for GN\u0394220\u2013231 was similar to GN226\u2013289, i.e. the localization resulted in accumulation of fluorescent protein in the cytoplasm and nucleus with high fluorescence intensity in the nucleolus (Fig. 7S and T). To determine if this LRR could export a heterogous protein from the nucleus, a construct GN220\u2013231 was used. This construct was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 7R) whilst in some cells, fluorescent granules were surrounding the nuclear envelope with very low fluorescence label in the nucleus (data not shown). These observations suggest that LRR may act as an NES and this also might explain the cytoplasmic localization of mutant proteins N176\u2013422 (Fig. 4C) and GN176\u2013422 (Fig. 7G). Another point to note is \u223c20% of transfected cells only showed nucleolar localization of C-terminal N protein; this may be due to other unknown factors favoring the protein to the cytoplasm.",

Our results showed a prolonged G0/G1 phase with a shortened S phase compared with control cells (Table 1\n). The experiment was repeated three times and the results were reproducible. These results indicated that Vero E6 cells constitutively expressing N protein exhibited cell growth retardation most likely through G0/G1 arrest.",

Interestingly, the C-terminal N (aa209\u2013422) was mapped as the region, which participated in the formation of the N\u2013N protein interaction (Surjit et al., 2004b). Due to the high concentration of basics residues, this region could involved in the interaction with RNA, DNA or nucleolar proteins such as B23 and nucleolin which contain stretches of acidic residues. The minimal peptide sequence required for nucleolar localization was not elucidated in this study. However, the NoLS associated with most viral proteins is usually no longer than 20 amino acids and possesses at least nine basic residues, including one continuous stretch of four basic amino acids or two stretches of three basic amino acids (Garcia-Bustos et al., 1991, Kubota et al., 1989).

Sequence analysis of the C-terminal N revealed the presence of two hydrophobic regions, 351-VILL and 392-VTLL that flanked the NLS3 at N- and C-terminal, respectively. In other words, the activity of NLS3 was recovered by removing the flanked hydrophobic regions, suggesting that these regions could have hidden the NLS3 from exposing to the surface of the protein.

Since, few cells showed a weak expression of wild type N protein in the nucleus (Fig. 2D), possible reasons could be that LRR exhibits a strong export signal favoring the N to the cytoplasm (for review, see reference (Rowland and Yoo, 2003)). Furthermore, the location of LRR is just close to the N-terminal of NLS2, which might have affected its function; these findings suggest that N may act as shuttle protein. Moreover, additional experiments are needed to study the molecular mechanism of SARS\u2013CoV N protein LRR. The PRRSV coronavirus and EVA arterivirus N proteins utilize the CRM1-mediated nuclear export pathway. Inactivation of this pathway with leptomycin B (LMB) resulted in nuclear retention of N, demonstrating that protein shuttles between cytoplasm and nucleus before playing role in virus assembly (Rowland and Yoo, 2003, Tijms et al., 2002). When GN1\u2013422 expressing cells were treated with 20 ng/ml of LMB for 4 h or for prolong period of time (overnight) or even at higher concentration (100 ng/ml) for 2 h, the localization of N protein was unaltered, i.e. predominantly cytoplasmic (data not shown), possible reasons could be that N protein exported via exportin-independent pathway or LRR could act as masking signal rather than NES.",

Recent reports demonstrated that SARS\u2013CoV induced apoptosis in virus-infected cells (Mizutani et al., 2004a, Mizutani et al., 2004b, Yan et al., 2004), whilst Surjit et al. showed that SARS\u2013CoV N induced apoptosis in COS-1 cells under stressed condition and activated Caspase-3 and -7 (Surjit et al., 2004a). The appearance of shorter form of N protein late in the infection has been observed with different strains of TGEV (Eleouet et al., 2000) and another report demonstrated the cleavage of recombinant N of SARS\u2013CoV by Caspase-3 but not Caspase-6 in vitro and the pattern of peptide fragments distribution were similar to that in infected cells (Ying et al., 2004) which is consistent with our result (Fig. 1A, lane 1). Taken together, we hypothesized that at a late stage of infection, the activation of Caspases during the apoptosis of the infected cells by SARS\u2013CoV leads to the cleavage of N protein at particular sites. Some of the cleavage products may contain an active NLS leading to its translocation to the nucleus and that may disrupt or usurp nuclear function whereas self-association of some N molecules (He et al., 2004a) may protect N from cleavage by Caspases and remain in the cytoplasm to participate in the virus assembly.",

Vero E6 cells constitutively expressing N protein exhibited a pronounced retardation of cell growth by reduced colony formation efficiency concomitantly with a shortened S phase and a prolonged G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Many viral proteins that have nuclear/nucleolar localization properties were reported to disrupt cell cycle, for instance, TGEV and IBV N proteins cause aberrant cell division by disrupting cytokinesis and this inhibits or delays cell growth (Chen et al., 2002, Wurm et al., 2001) and in HeLa cells, HIV-I Vpr which is a nucleolar-cytoplasmic protein causes growth retardation and G2 arrest (Nishizawa et al., 1999). While in HCV NS5A, N-terminally deleted form but not the full length localizes to the nucleus and the protein causes growth inhibition and cell cycle perturbations through G2 arrest (Arima et al., 2001, Song et al., 2000). Recently Chen and Makino demonstrated that MHV coronavirus infection in asynchronously growing cells led to the inhibition of host DNA synthesis and accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase and they subsequently attributed to a replicase protein (Chen and Makino, 2004, Chen et al., 2004). Future studies need to be designed to elucidate the role of N protein in regulation of cell cycle, e.g. interaction with nucleolar proteins and activation or suppression cell cycle regulators. Thus, the localization to the nucleus/nucleolus implies that N protein may involve in the regulating of cell cycle possibly by delaying the cell growth to promote intracellular conditions for virus assembly and sequestering ribosomes for translation of viral proteins or by participating in the modulation of nucleolar functions, a strategy to optimize virus replication [see (Hiscox, 2003) for a review]. The identification of different nuclear and nucleolar localization properties of N protein from other members of Coronaviridae family suggests a unique function for N protein and will enable us to investigate the role of N protein in the pathogenesis of SARS and that N protein might have contributed in some way to the severity of the recent out break.",
