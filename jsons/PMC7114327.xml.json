For example, regular physical activity reduces the risk of diabetes; condoms help reduce the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV; reductions in cigarette consumption help avoid pulmonary cancer; and hand washing with soap prevents gastrointestinal diseases. However, despite their effectiveness, the take up rates of these products or behaviors is very low (Dupas, 2011). For instance, while the role of hand washing as an effective way to reduce gastrointestinal diseases has been known for more than a century (Koplik, 1902),2\nin developing countries, only 30% of household members wash their hands before preparing food or after defecation. In some countries the rate is as low as zero (World Bank, 2005, Chase and Do, 2010). Moreover, intensive small-scale interventions show significant reductions in diarrhea (e.g., Ejemot-Nwadiaro et al., 2008, Luby et al., 2004, Luby et al., 2005),3\nbut scaling up similar interventions does not (e.g., Meredith et al., 2013, Galiani et al., 2012).4\nUnderstanding the barriers for the adoption of these preventive behaviors and products is an urgent issue in health and development economics.",

Rather, the emphasis seems to be on when information alters the decision-making process (Luoto and Carman 2014). Our paper contributes to this literature by showing that health shocks such as disease outbreaks can operate as \u201cnatural nudges\u201d that facilitate changes in health behaviors that lead to improvements in health outcomes, and that these types of shock-induced improvements can have long-lasting effects.",

This is done with a difference-in-difference framework using a balanced panel of annual state-level data aggregated from hospital discharges related to diarrhea and the total number of laboratory confirmed cases of the swine flu in Mexico derived from Mexico\u2019s Ministry of Health (Secretaria de Salud).",

Additional placebo tests and robustness checks further support our results. For example, we find no association between diarrhea-related cases before the H1N1 outbreak (2006\u20132008) and the number of confirmed swine flu cases observed in 2009. There is also no evidence of people avoiding hospitals altogether due to the H1N1 pandemic.

Thus, people experienced an environment where the new virus was affecting a large number of individuals, and could, in some cases, be fatal. This provides an important context to test theoretical models of health behavior where a decision to engage in preventive behavior is triggered only when the (contagious) disease crosses a high threshold (e.g., Philipson 2000). Consistent with such models, we find a null effect for the seasonal flu on diarrhea outcomes that contrasts with our negative and large findings from the H1N1.",

Using a balanced panel at the state and year-level, our difference-in-difference identification strategy is formally presented in Eq.

We also investigate other treatment and baseline periods, which are discussed in Section 4.3. We use H1N1 counts rather than rates because we believe that part of the mechanism through which individuals\u2019 perceptions changed was rooted in the perceived magnitude of the problem as reported on news media channels. The news media reported the total number of cases that had been confirmed at the national level as well as the states where the highest number of cases had been confirmed.20\nThus, \u03b2 is our parameter of interest as it captures the difference-in-difference impact.

That is, there were fewer hospital discharges related to diarrhea in states with more swine flu cases, even after controlling for time and state fixed-effects.

Given the average number of diarrhea-related hospitalizations for this group (1117 in the period 2008\u20132009), the estimated association indicates that for every 1000 cases of the swine flu we observe a 9.4 percent decline in diarrhea-related hospitalizations (-0.105*1000/1117).

For example, with the arrival of the H1N1, cases that should have been identified as diarrhea (belonging to ICD codes A00-A09X) could have been incorrectly classified as swine flu. After all, up to 13 percent of the diarrhea swine flu cases exhibited vomit, nausea or diarrhea as an additional symptom. We argue that this misclassification is an unlikely event for the following reasons. First, as explained in the data section above, the H1N1 cases used in our study were confirmed cases using laboratory tests. So even if some of them included a diarrhea symptom, these cases were coded as J09 in our data because a strain of the novel type of influenza was found in these patients. Second, the recorded disease is made by a trained medical professional. So if parents suspect their children have H1N1, when the actually have diarrhea, what is recorded is the actual assessment of the physician and not what the patient (or his parents) suspected.21\nThird, we expect medical professionals to be less likely to misdiagnose a diarrhea case not only because of their medical training but because Mexico has identified intestinal infections as a public health issue based on the magnitude and prevalence of the disease (with at least 11% of children under five being affected by this problem each year). These professionals are also more likely to be aware of the population at risk for different diseases. As shown in Fig. 2\n, which presents the age distribution of these two diseases for hospitalizations,22\nthe H1N1 affected disproportionally school-going children and adults while diarrhea affects primarily children under 5.

However, it is positive, small and not statistically different from zero for all other age groups (columns 1, 3\u20135), including older patients who are the second most at-risk age group of diarrhea (as shown in Fig. 2, Panel B).

In 2008, for instance, there were 1.5 million cases of diarrhea nationwide but only 89,103 cases of conjunctivitis. This could explain the lack of statistical significance for this estimate. When we add hepatitis A (ICD-10 code B15, also from the Anuarios de Morbilidad) and conjunctivitis together as a new outcome we continue to observe a negative association with H1N1, alas unable to reject the null hypothesis (results available upon request). Again, this could be explained by the few cases of hepatitis A among this age group (only 4348 in 2008) relative to the diarrhea cases. We think this evidence, although not as strong as desired, adds to the support that the negative, robust and statistically significant effect of H1N1 on diarrhea is less likely to come from a mechanical classification problem.",

If during the H1N1 outbreak doctors misclassified diarrhea cases, these cases are more likely to come from those where the cause is unknown (ICD-10 code A09X) and much less so, if at all, from those where the cause is known (ICD-10 codes A00-A08) (see Appendix Table 2 in Supplementary material for details about specific ICD-10 codes). In Table 4 we test for this hypothesis by using the ratio between known cases of diarrhea and the unknown sources as our outcome variable. Misclassification implies that more cases of H1N1 will be positively associated with this ratio: the denominator (the unknown sources) decreases but not the numerator. Our estimates strongly reject this prediction of misclassification. We find no association between the ratio and the H1N1 (Table 4, column 1). Specifically, our point estimate using hospitalizations is 0.0001 (bootstrapped p-value = 0.853) and a similarly small and not statistically different from zero estimate when using the morbidity dataset (coefficient = 0.0001, p-value = 0.136).23\nTaken together, all these results indicate that our findings are not driven by some misclassification of the diagnosis.24\n",

The second specification discards the pairwise comparison and expands the sample to include all years 2006\u20132009 (columns 4 and 5 of Table 2). The inclusion of more years permits us to add state-specific trends that were not possible in the pairwise comparison. The results of these new specifications indicate that our findings are not sensitive to these changes. Specifically, defining 2007 or 2006 as the base year does not qualitatively alter our conclusion. We continue to find a negative association (but with lower precision) and these parameters are not statistically different from the estimates using the original base year. Furthermore, expanding the data to include 2006 through 2009 we conclude that controlling for state trends (column 5) or not (column 4) provides robust findings: areas with a higher incidence of H1N1 see a larger decline in the number of diarrhea cases (with significant levels of 10 percent for hospitalizations and even lower for morbidity). All these findings hold when using the hospitalization data (Panel A) or the morbidity (Panel B).

We provided evidence against this possibility earlier as we showed that the effects are also observed among morbidity cases, beyond hospitalizations. We explore this using hospital discharges associated with hip-related procedures for all age groups, and hospital discharges (excluding H1N1) for children under five. Hip-related procedures try to capture hospital visits that could be delayed. If these procedures were negatively related to the H1N1, we would find evidence that adults were avoiding hospitals. In column 3 of Table 4 we identify a null result. Similarly, if we observe a statistically significant decline in all types of hospitalizations for children, it would also suggest that parents were not taking their children hospitals. A null result for this outcome is presented in column 4 of Table 4. If anything, in both cases we find a (very small) positive parameter that is not statistically significant. Thus, we can rule out the possibility that our findings come from people avoiding hospitals during the swine flu pandemic.26\nIn column 3 of Table 4 Panel B, we show the results of the analysis where mortality due to diarrhea is the outcome measure. The estimated coefficient is 0.0003 and is not statistically significant, implying that there is no change in overall child mortality due to diarrhea in areas with more cases of the swine flu. This is important as we can rule out deaths from diarrhea happening at home, rather than at hospitals, for areas of high H1N1 prevalence.27\n",

A survey conducted in Mexico City and two states with varying prevalence of the swine flu showed that the top three mitigation efforts adopted to protect against the H1N1 virus included frequent washing of hands with soap, use of a mask, and hand sanitizer (Aburto et al., 2010).30\nWe reproduce these findings in Appendix Table 5 in Supplementary material. This table also shows that people in states with higher incidence of the swine flu at the time of the survey had higher usage of hand sanitizer.

The results of column 6 indicate that 1000 cases of the H1N1 are associated with an increase of 3.2 units in Google searches for hand sanitizers and it is statistically different from zero at the 10% level using bootstrapped standard errors. This represents a substantial increase (42 percent) with respect to average value during the period of analysis (mean = 7.63). Note that due to low search volume there are no data for eight states,33\nso in column 7 we ran our regression for Google searches replacing the missing values with zeroes (the lowest possible value in the Google Trends index) for those eight states. This way, we are able to utilize the full dataset. This imputation leads to similar findings \u2212more Google searches in areas with a higher incidence of the H1N1\u2014and it allows us to gain precision for the estimates by \u201crecovering\u201d those missing values (p-value < 0.10). These analyses indicate that the main mechanism arises from the demand for knowledge regarding hygiene practices and not so much from the other channels examined above.",

Is this effect also observed with the spread of respiratory infections arising due to the seasonal flu? Theoretical models predict that engagements in preventive behavior are triggered only when the (contagious) disease crosses a threshold (Philipson 2000). Such models would predict a null effect from the seasonal flu but an important reaction from the H1N1 pandemic. To study this question we modify Eq. (1) as follows,(2)yst=\u03b1+\u03bbFlust+\u03c4t+\u03b8s+\u03bcst+est,where ys\nt represents the hospital discharges of diarrhea for children under five in state s and year t (A00-A09X). In Eq. (2) we are interested in the effect of the seasonal flu (Flust) for all ages (similar to our H1N1 variable). We obtained these data from Mexico\u2019s SINAVE for years prior to the H1N1 pandemic (2006\u20132008). This variable represents morbidity cases of the seasonal flu. While both the swine and the seasonal flu could be considered as health shocks, the latter did not exhibit the unexpected magnitude and the uncertain nature of the H1N1 pandemic. Thus we can test whether small, expected health shocks (the seasonal flu) have similar effects to larger and unexpected health shocks (the swine flu). Analogous to Eq. (2), \u03bb is the parameter of interest and as before, we control for state (\u03b8s) and time (\u03c4t) fixed effects. We also include state-specific trends (\u03bcst).

In that regard, by focusing on gastrointestinal infections in Mexico, our study expands our knowledge of the role of behavioral changes in a much less investigated setting and addresses an important gap in the literature. Second, the fact that the 2009 pandemic matters for behavioral change, compared to the null effect found from the smaller (and more predictable) seasonal flu, provides empirical support for theoretical models where a decision to engage in preventive behavior is triggered only when the (contagious) disease crosses a threshold (e.g., Philipson 2000).
