During the 2015 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak in the Midwest, more than 40 million birds were killed and 10% of the US egg supply was affected [6]. In addition to their devastating impact on the poultry industry, occasional direct transmission of AIVs from poultry to humans has resulted in serious outbreaks in the past that produced fatal outcomes [7, 8]. The recent avian H5N1, H7N7, and H7N9 human outbreaks in China and Europe have come with severe respiratory illness resulting in severe respiratory symptoms and death in some cases [8\u201310].",

The NS1 protein is known to enhance virus replication by antagonizing antiviral host cell functions, especially by blocking type I interferon (IFN) responses [15]. In this context, influenza viruses with truncation in the NS1 (NS1-truncated) provoke high type I IFN responses and replicate poorly in IFN competent hosts [16]. However, we have observed that not all NS1-truncated variants are effective as LAIV candidates [17]. Four NS1-truncated mutants were previously tested for their capacity to induce protective immunity in chickens [17]. Two of the mutants (pc3-LAIV and pc4-LAIV) were more efficacious than the other two (pc1-LAIV and pc2-LAIV) in protecting chickens against heterologous challenge virus [17].",

The in vivo efficacy of vaccine candidates [17] was observed to correlate strongly with induction of high yields of type I IFN in vitro [18, 19]. For example, infection of chicken embryonic fibroblasts with pc4-LAIV, the more efficacious LAIV in chickens, resulted in production of high levels of type I IFN compared to pc2-LAIV (the less effective vaccine) [17, 18]. This finding is suggestive but does not prove that type I IFN is required to boost the efficacy of NS1-truncated LAIV in chickens.",

The Ohio State University is accredited by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC). White leghorn chickens were obtained from our institutional (Food Animal Health Research Program, Wooster, OH) specific pathogen free (SPF) flock. The chickens were housed in a BSL2 facility with forced air ventilation and adequate air exchanges to prevent ammonia build up. Air entering or leaving the facility is HEPA filtered. The birds were kept in large cages (2592 sq. inch) before infection and transferred to Model 934\u20131 isolators (900 sq. inch) (Federal Designs Inc., Comer, GA). The number of birds in each cage was calculated based on age and the space available after subtracting the space occupied by the feeder and the watering system. Room and isolator temperatures were maintained at 25\u00b13\u00b0C. Birds had ad libitum access to feed and water. The wellbeing and health status of the animals was monitored twice daily throughout the experiments. Animals were humanely euthanized when they displayed symptoms such as ruffled feathers and reluctance to move, not moving when prodded, respiratory distress, or injuries that were not related to experimental treatment. Euthanasia was actualized by exposure to carbon dioxide (CO2). Based on the age and body size, 1\u201310 animals were placed in the euthanasia chamber connected to a CO2 source. The CO2 flow was set at 10\u201330% displacement of chamber volume/minute. Birds were observed for respiratory arrest and the CO2 flow was maintained for at least one minute after the arrest was observed. The animals were checked for an absence of breathing and lack of heartbeat. If any respiration or heartbeat was detected, the animal was placed back into the chamber and additional CO2 was administered as described above. After death has been confirmed, an additional secondary physical euthanasia (cervical dislocation or removal of a vital organ) was performed before collection of tissues and carcass disposal.",

To allow interpolation of median egg infective dose (EID50) titers of swab samples by the qRT-PCR method [27, 28], a standard curve was created by plotting cycle threshold (Ct) values generated with RNA extracted from serial 10-fold dilutions of the same virus stock (with known EID50 titer) used to inoculate the chickens as a function of virus dilution. The curve was used to convert Ct values of tracheal swab viral RNA to EID50 titers. EID50 titers derived by qRT-PCR are equivalent to EID50 titers measured in eggs [28]. MDCK cells were used for virus isolation and median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) calculation. The cells were propagated in DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10 \u03bcg/ml gentamicin.

Thus, the rapid seroconversion of pc4-LAIV-vaccinated chickens (Fig 1) could be due to high IFN response in vivo. We tested this possibility by analyzing the expression levels of IFN and IFN-related genes in trachea and spleen tissues following vaccination with LAIV candidates or infection with rgWT virus. Two IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), 2\u2032,5\u2032-OAS and Mx, were targeted due to their high sensitivity to the type I IFN stimulus. Fig 3 shows that at 1 dpv/dpi, the level of 2\u2032,5\u2032-OAS gene transcription was significantly increased in trachea and spleen tissues of chickens vaccinated with pc4-LAIV or infected with rgWT but not in the trachea of pc2-LAIV-vaccinated birds. Expression of the Mx gene was significantly upregulated only in 1 dpv tracheal tissues from pc4-LAIV-vaccinated chickens and downregulated in 3 dpv/dpi spleen samples from pc2-LAIV and rgWT vaccinated/infected birds. We could not detect any increase in type I IFN (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) gene transcription although there was upregulation of the IFN-\u03b3 gene in spleen samples collected from the pc4-LAIV-vaccincation group at 3 dpv.",

This dose of type I IFN was previously shown to have biological effects in 33-day old chickens [30]. Fig 4A shows that 9 of 10 rChIFN-\u03b1-treated birds seroconverted by 8 days dpt compared to only 4 out of 10 birds provided with plain drinking water. All remaining birds (n = 5) in the rChIFN-\u03b1-treatment group seroconverted by 14 dpt while one of the 5 birds provided with plain drinking water was HI negative. Further, a wider range of HI titers was observed in the untreated group (Log2 HI titer <1\u20137) relative to the treated birds (Log2 HI titer 2\u20136) at 14 dpt (Fig 4A).

Thus, we hypothesized that the poor immunogenicity and inefficacy of pc2-LAIV is mainly due to the lower type I IFN induction capacity in chickens and tested whether oral treatment with type I IFN can boost the protective efficacy of pc2-LAIV. Thirty five chickens were divided into five groups (n = 7 per group): unvaccinated control; pc2-LAIV vaccination; IFN treatment + pc2-LAIV vaccination (exogenous rChIFN-\u03b1 treatment); poly I:C treatment + pc2-LAIV LAIV vaccination (endogenous IFN induction); and pc4-LAIV vaccination groups. Poly I:C was previously shown to enhance adaptive immune responses to influenza vaccine in chickens [31]. Vaccine immunogenicity was first assessed by testing serum HI antibody titer. As described above (Fig 1), pc4-LAIV vaccination provoked an early antibody response at 8 dpv (5 out of 8 birds (65.5%)), but no antibody response was detected in pc2-LAIV-vaccinated animals even after treatment with exogenous rChIFN-\u03b1 or poly I:C (Fig 5). At 15 dpv, we challenged the birds with a heterologous (H7N2) virus and compared the protective efficacy among the vaccination groups. One bird in the unvaccinated control group was euthanized at 2 days post challenge (dpc) due to severe clinical symptoms (ruffled feathers and periorbital swelling). Consistent with the previous report [17], pc4-LAIV vaccination consistently showed the highest degree of protection against the heterologous challenge virus as indicated by EID50 equivalent titers detected by qRT-PCR (Fig 6, top (p<0.001)) and confirmed by virus isolation in MDCK cells at 2 and 4 dpc (Fig 6, bottom (2 dpc, p<0.001; 4 dpc, p<0.05)). In contrast, significant reduction of virus shedding by pc2-LAIV vaccination was only detected in 4 dpc samples using the virus isolation method (Fig 6, bottom right (p<0.05)). Of note, treatment of birds with rChIFN-\u03b1 prior to pc2-LAIV vaccination led to a significant reduction in the titer of re-isolated challenge virus at both time points (Fig 6, bottom (2 dpc, p<0.001; 4 dpc, p<0.05)) and virus detected by qPCR at 4 dpc (Fig 6, top right (p<0.001)). Poly I:C treatment did not enhance the efficacy of pc2-LAIV, rather it appears to have increased the level of virus replication (Fig 6).",

During the first two weeks post vaccination, the development of adaptive immune responses was monitored by measuring HI antibody titers in serum samples. In line with our previous observation [17], pc4-LAIV was superior to pc2-LAIV in terms of inducing seroconversion and HI antibodies in chickens. In addition, the current study has provided new insight into induction of adaptive immune responses by NS1-truncated LAIV candidates. We have demonstrated that pc4-LAIV consistently induced a rapid antibody response within 8 days following intranasal vaccination (Figs 1 and 5). This can shorten the risk period between vaccination and the development of protective immunity especially in young birds that do not respond well to inactivated vaccines [32]. The inability of pc2-LAIV to induce seroconversion may be attributed to over-attenuation (suboptimal replication) (Fig 1) and poor immunogenicity of the vaccine.",

The type I IFN is also known to enhance the mucosal and systemic adaptive immune responses [34\u201336]. In chickens, rChIFN-\u03b1 treatment was shown to induce more rapid seroconversion to natural infection by low-pathogenicity influenza virus [37]. In mice, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 treatment promoted fast and polyclonal antibody responses [38] and a recombinant rabies virus expressing IFN-\u03b11 was shown to stimulate an antibody response that was more rapid compared to the isogenic wildtype virus [39]. Thus, induction of rapid immune responses by the pc4-LAIV may be due to its capacity to trigger higher levels of type I IFN compared to pc2-LAIV and rgWT virus [18].",

            "text": "Contrary to the high levels of type I IFN induced in primary chicken fibroblast cells [18], expression of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 genes was generally not upregulated except for a small but statistically significant increase in IFN-\u03b1 transcription in 3 dpv spleens of the pc2-LAIV group (Fig 3). The discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo IFN inducing capacities of our vaccine candidates is a subject for future study. Penski et al [40] reported a similar discrepancy where a set of NS1-truncated mutants were able to induce high levels of IFN in chicken cell cultures but were poor inducers in chickens, in vivo, in a manner that correlated with virus replication. The fact that our vaccine candidates and the isogenic rgWT virus are very attenuated in chickens (<103 EID50/ml of swab eluate) (Fig 1) could explain why we did not see upregulation of IFN genes in trachea and spleen tissues collected at 1 and 3 dpv/dpi. However, it does not explain why there was significant upregulation of the 2\u2032,5\u2032 OAS gene in trachea and spleen tissues of chickens vaccinated with pc4-LAIV or infected with rgWT and Mx gene in tracheal tissues from pc4-LAIV-vaccinated chickens (Fig 3). It is possible that both pc4-LAIV and rgWT were able to induce some IFN that triggered ISG upregulation [41]. We could have missed a critical time point for IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 gene detection or a cell population that produces large amounts of the cytokine in chickens [40]. Alternatively, ISG transcription may have been triggered directly by the virus infection independently of IFN signaling [42, 43]. For example, the 2\u2032,5\u2032-OAS gene can be activated by dsRNA independently of IFN signaling [43]. The level of ISG transcription can also be affected by the ability of truncated or full-size NS1 proteins to suppress epigenetic control of gene regulation [44, 45]. Although our study focused on the 2\u2032,5\u2032-OAS and Mx genes, there are more than 300 ISGs [46]. An in-depth study is required to identify ISGs that are critical for vaccine efficacy and to delineate the mechanism of ISG upregulation by the NS1-truncated LAIV candidates.",

Thus, our orally-administered rChIFN-\u03b1 was biologically active. Clearly, the rapid antibody development in birds treated with rChIFN-\u03b1 and vaccinated with whole inactivated rgWT virus vaccine (Fig 4A) was similar to that observed in pc4-vaccinated birds (Figs 1 and 5). It is worth noting that both the rgWT virus and pc4-LAIV have the same backbone genes and proteins except for the NS1 gene/protein [17] and humoral immune response to whole virus inactivated vaccine is mainly directed to HA and NA proteins (not the NS1 protein) [47]. Therefore, a whole inactivated pc4 vaccine is also expected to induce rapid seroconversion in rChIFN-\u03b1 treated chickens. Future work should determine how ISGs, IFN, and pc4-LAIV interdependently or independently trigger the acceleration of adaptive immune responses.",

            "text": "The poor efficacy of pc2-LAIV may result from an inability to induce high levels of type I IFN [19] or ISGs (Fig 3). This prompted us to test whether direct (exogenous) IFN treatment or endogenous IFN induction by poly I:C can enhance pc2-LAIV efficacy. Heterologous protection by pc2-LAIV was significantly enhanced by rChIFN-\u03b1 treatment (Fig 6). Although the in vivo half-life of rChIFN-\u03b1 has yet to be determined, non-PEGylated interferons have short in vivo half-lives due to low stability. For example, in humans, orally administered non-PEGylated IFN has a half-life of up to 8.5 hours [48]. Since the rChIFN-\u03b1 was administered for 4 days and withdrawn on the day of vaccination and the chickens were challenged at 2 weeks post vaccination, it is less likely that reduction of virus shedding was due to the innate effects of IFN.",

The ability of IFN to facilitate seroconversion in the context of live virus may depend on the virus strain. The enhanced protective efficacy of pc2-LAIV in rChIFN-\u03b1 treated chickens may be due to stimulation of cross-protective cell-mediated immunity [49\u201351]. We will address this possibility in a separate study. Another unexpected result was the observation that poly I:C treatment not only failed to enhance pc2-LAIV efficacy but also appeared to cause a slight increase in virus shedding at 4 dpc (Fig 6). We speculate that the dose of poly I:C (100 \u03bcg/bird) used in this study was not optimal for pc2-LAIV even though it was previously shown to enhance adaptive immune responses to inactivated avian H5N1 influenza vaccine in chickens [31].",
