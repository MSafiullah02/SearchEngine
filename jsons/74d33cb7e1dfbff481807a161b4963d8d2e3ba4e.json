            "text": "The outbreak of COVID-19 has spreaded rapidly across the world. To control the rapid dispersion of the virus, China has imposed national lockdown policies to practise social distancing. This has led to reduced human activities and hence primary air pollutant emissions, which caused improvement of air quality as a side-product. To investigate the air quality changes during the COVID-19 lockdown over the YRD Region, we apply the WRF-CAMx modelling system together with monitoring data to investigate the impact of human activity pattern changes on air quality. Results show that human activities were lowered significantly during the period: industrial operations, VKT, constructions in operation, etc. were significantly reduced, leading to lowered SO 2 , NO x , PM 2.5 and VOCs emissions by approximately 16-26%, 29-47%, 27-46% and 37-57% during the Level I and Level II response periods respectively. These emission reduction has played a significant role in the improvement of air quality. Concentrations of PM 2.5 , NO 2 and SO 2 decreased by 31.8%, 45.1% and 20.4% during the Level I period; and 33.2%, 27.2% and 7.6% during the Level II period compared with 2019. However, ozone did not show any reduction and increased greatly. Our results also show that even during the lockdown, with primary emissions reduction of 15%-61%, the daily average PM 2.5 concentrations range between 15-79 \u03bcg m -3 , which shows that background and residual pollutions are still high. Source apportionment results indicate that the residual pollution of PM 2.5 comes from industry (32.2-61.1%), mobile (3.9-8.1%), dust (2.6-7.7%), residential sources (2.1-28.5%) in YRD and 14.0-28.6% contribution from long-range transport coming from northern China. This indicates that in spite of the extreme reductions in primary emissions, it cannot fully tackle the current air pollution. Re-organisation of the energy and industrial strategy together with trans-regional Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 joint-control for a full long-term air pollution plan need to be further taken into account.",

Moreover the pandemic has caused enormorous economic and social disruption (Wang et al., 2020a) . To control the rapid spread of the disease to protect people's health, China has enacted emergency response procedures, and required people to stay at home instead of going out beginning from late January 2020 (Tian et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020b) , resulting in significant reduction in the number of vehicle kilometres travelled (VKT), industrial operations, constructions, and even restaurants in operation, etc. Human and industrial activities were reduced to essential or bare minimal only. As we know that these are general emission sources that cause air pollution, especially during this particular winter season (Zhang et al., 2019) . Thus the air quality during COVID-19 in China is much better than previous years in the same time period. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) had published statellite imageries of the massive reduction in NO 2 over China resulting from the economic slow-down and the reduced human activities (NASA, 2020) . Other analyses have similarly found that ground-based concentrations of key pollutants fell substantially across much of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 3 To understand the details of the air quality changes, we have divided the whole period into four stages:",

According to the 'National Emergency Response Plan for Public Emergencies' issued by China State Council, the level of early warning is based on the degree of harm that may be caused by public emergencies, the degree of urgency and development. It is generally divided into four levels: Level I (particularly serious), Level II (serious), Level III (heavier) and Level IV (general). On 24 th January 2020, the YRD region entered the first level of response, cities actively carried out epidemic prevention and control measures, including the adoption of compulsory measures in accordance with the law to stop all large-scale mass events such as bazaars and assemblies, etc. During Level I response period, the public significantly reduced the number of people and vehicles in public places, industrial enterprises, construction sites, catering enterprises and other large-scale work stoppage and closure. After two months of struggle, the number of new confirmed cases per day across the country has dropped dramatically and more and more people are being cured and discharged from hospital. As the situation of the epidemic improved, on 25 th February, 2020, the emergency response level in Anhui and Jiangsu provinces was downgraded from a primary response to a secondary response. Zhejiang and Shanghai were adjusted on 2 nd March and 24 th March, respectively. Secondary response period, under the premise of good protective measures, the YRD cities allow some industrial enterprises to resume work and resume production, construction sites can be built; blanket cancellation of the village closures, citizens can rely on the health code and wear a mask to travel locally, road traffic flow gradually increased. Since 31 st March, the YRD region enters into Level III period, with most activities gradually enetering into operation except schools, etc., of cause with strict protection measures.

For emission reductions outside the YRD region during lockdown, we apply the reduction ratio used by Wang et al. (2020b) . In both cases, the same meteorology are utilised to drive the photochemical model simulations. Through a comparative analysis of the scenarios, a relative improvement factor RF for a given atmospheric pollutant, resulting from emission reductions, can be calculated and combined with ground based observations to assess the changes in air quality associated with those emission reductions caused due to lowered human activities,",

Similar results for changes in SO 2 , NO 2 and O 3 concentrations are shown inTable S7-S9. Results show that because of the restricted human activities and lowered anthropogenice emissions, PM 2.5 concentrations are reduced by 25.4% to 48.1% during Level I response period.A maximum reduction of PM 2.5 concentration by 27.3 \u03bcg m -3 is found for the city of Fuyang (located in northern Anhui province) during Level I response period while a maximum relative PM 2.5 reduction by 48.1% is found for the city of Taizhou (Jiangsu province). During the Level II respone period when restrictions on normal acitivites were loosened to some extent, reductions in PM 2.5 concentration due to lockdown range between 15.3% to 36.0%, which is approximately 10% lower than Level I response period.

During Level II response period, 30 out of 41 cities show ozone increase with maximum increase by 16.8% in Shanghai.
