            "text": "Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a common pathogen of cattle that causes major economic losses to dairy industry. The virus is a member of the Pestivirus genus in the family Flaviviridae (Wengler et al., 1995). BVDV isolates were segregated into two genotypes based on comparison of sequences from the 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032 UTR) of the viral genome (Ridpath et al., 1994, Ridpath and Bolin, 1998). Infection with BVD virus causes gastrointestinal disease, reproductive failure, respiratory disorders, fetal malformation and persistent infections (PI). The PI animals act as reservoirs of virus and shed the virus for life exposing other animals in the herd. In addition to a good vaccination program, identification and removal of PI animals from the herd is an essential component of control measures for eradication of BVD virus (Fulton and Burge, 2000, Cortese and Victor, 1999).",

Nested PCR was used to simultaneously detect and type BVD virus from clinical specimens (El-Kholy et al., 1998, Gilbert et al., 1999, Ridpath and Bolin, 1998). In most of the studies, two-step RT\u2013PCR reaction was followed by agarose gel analysis for the detection of amplicons. Other studies performed probe hybridization (Radwan et al., 1995, Letellier et al., 1999) and restriction enzyme analysis (Canal et al., 1996) to evaluate the specificity of the amplified fragments. The application of RT\u2013PCR and its subsequent analysis in a diagnostic setting requires simple, rapid but reproducible procedures with few steps. The development of fluorogenic PCR utilizing 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 nuclease activity of Taq DNA polymerase made it possible to eliminate post PCR processing (Holland et al., 1991).",

The system uses oligonucleotide probes labeled with fluorescent dyes, a reporter at the 5\u2032 end and a quencher at the 3\u2032 end (Livak et al., 1995). The quencher suppresses the reporter dye emission when both are attached to the probe. During each PCR cycle, the Taq DNA polymerase cleaves the reporter dye from the annealed probe by its 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 nucleolytic activity (Gibson et al., 1996). The free reporter dye emits its characteristic signal that can be detected by the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system. The increase in fluorescence emission is proportional to the accumulated PCR products. In this study a TaqMan\u2013PCR assay was developed for detection, classification and quantitation of BVD virus in single tube. Specific probes were designed to classify BVD virus as genotype I or II. Quantitation of BVD virus was performed using an RNA standard.",

The RNA standard representing the partial 5\u2032 UTR of BVD virus was synthesized in vitro. Viral RNA isolated from NADL strain of BVD virus was reverse transcribed and amplified as described in Section 2.3. The following primer set was used for the above reaction; forward 57 and reverse 421 designed from 5\u2032 UTR of NADL strain (Collet et al., 1988). The cDNA obtained was amplified in a second round of PCR with the primer set T7-103 and 421. The forward primer T7-103 consists of a 27 bp T-7 promoter sequence (Vanden Heuvel et al., 1993) with 21 bp BVD specific sequence of primer 103. Sequences of the above primer sets were given in Table 1. Amplicons were separated on 2% agarose gel and purified using gel extraction kit (Qiagen, #28704). Pure cDNA was transcribed to cRNA with T-7 RNA polymerase (Ambion, #1356). Ethanol precipitation and DNase treatment I purified the transcript to remove unused cDNA. Similar experiment was repeated with Type II-125 strain of BVD virus genotype II. Primers 87 and 372 were designed from type II sequence (Ridpath and Bolin, 1995) for first round amplification followed by second round PCR with T-7-103 and primer 372. The cDNA obtained was transcribed to cRNA as explained above. The RNA transcripts were dissolved in DEPC treated water and quantified by spectrophotometer. The cRNA was stored at \u221270\u00b0C. TaqMan\u2013PCR was performed with 10-fold serial dilutions (from 108 copies to 1 copy of RNA per reaction) as described in the above section.",
