This hero-victim scenario is signified by the amount of investment by northern-based international organizations to tackle infectious disease in southern, and particularly African, countries. Ayittey[17] indicates that the discourse reality of southern Africa in the eyes of international investors and support agencies is characterized by terms such as civil unrest, starvation, deadly diseases, and economic disorder [17]. The populations of southern countries have become victims of the discourse, which portrays them to the world as being less worthy than their northern counterparts owing to factors beyond their control. The normalization of language such as \u201cdeadly diseases\u201d creates an understanding that southern countries are victims of infectious disease, poverty, unrest, and so on, which embeds the inverse care paradox.[1718]",

Arguably, these create an understanding of infectious disease management, which signifies the limitations of biomedical interventions to tackle the root causes of vulnerability and susceptibility to infectious disease. While biotechnological advances\u2014particularly improvements in surveillance, early detection, vaccination, and antimicrobial drugs\u2014have reduced infectious disease mortality rates,[19] the long-term sustainability of these measures is questionable, particularly in southern countries due to the transient nature of infectious diseases: as soon as we discover solutions to existing diseases, new ones take their place because the fundamental causes remain in place.[202122232425]",

CDA research accepts that the construct of evidence-based knowledge derives from the social context and is interpreted through discursive constructs in a language which is influenced by sociocultural factors.[29] In this way, CDA recognizes that what is considered to be scientific knowledge is inherently part of and influenced by social structures, and produced in social interaction.

The focus on risk emerges as the accepted discourse, to the detriment of other discourses. Attention is directed toward the organic causes of disease, which can be studied and addressed by downstream biomedical interventions.[4849] This allows control of the agenda for infectious disease to rest with those who benefit from downstream interventions.[48] Dissenting discourses appear abnormal as they infringe upon the rules of the discursive regime created by the scientific community.[50] The outcome is that socioeconomic or upstream interventions are considered secondary.[4950]",

            "text": "The key contribution of this article is that it indicates that institutionalized ways of talking about infectious disease create power inequalities between populations where infectious disease is endemic and those that benefit from its decline. Consistent with the previous research, this study observes that the heaviest burden of infectious disease falls on poor populations. However, the difference between this study and others is that it questions the current assumption that by producing evidence-based associations between poverty and infectious disease we have solved the problem. It challenges the assumptions by dominant powers that application of evidence-based practices and guidelines solves the problem of infectious disease. It proposes that poverty creates vulnerability to infectious disease and restricts access to healthcare and, therefore, biomedical paradigms only serve to shift the focus away from the root cause of vulnerability to infectious disease. The current study proposes a new hypothesis that the search for the organic causes of infectious diseases needs to recognize that poverty is a fundamental determinant of their uneven global burden. This hypothesis is consistent with the argument by Molyneux[29] that the focus on organic causes of infectious disease has created constructs such as emergence, re-emergence, and neglected diseases. This was further validated by the inclusion of the elimination of extreme poverty in the MDGs as a way of achieving sustainable reductions in HIV/AIDS, malaria, and TB.",

Farmer promoted wider analytical discourse, but did not advocate a \u201czero-sum game\u201d; for instance, in tackling TB, he advised using effective short-term interventions while pursuing the root causes, and being mindful of historical contingencies and material changes. He later advocated a new search for understanding, with a research agenda and forms of scholarship that can examine the pathogenic effects of social inequalities.[61] Marmot argues for a balance of the three pillars, social, economic, and environmental, that are vital for health equity.[62]",
