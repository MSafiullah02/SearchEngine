            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIP virus: FIPV), a feline coronavirus (FCoV) of the family Coronaviridae, causes a fatal disease called FIP in wild and domestic cat species. Several organs, including the liver, lungs, spleen, serosae, kidneys, eyes, and central nervous system, are affected in cats that develop FIP, and the formation of lesions in these organs is accompanied by necrosis and pyogenic granulomatous inflammation (Pedersen, 2009). Pleural effusion and ascitic fluid was reported to accumulate in some cats. Macrophages/monocytes play an important role in the pathogenesis of FIP. For example, differences in the proliferation of virus in macrophages/monocytes were shown to be related to differences in pathogenicity between feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and FIPV (Dewerchin et al., 2005; Stoddart and Scott, 1989). FECV and FIPV cannot be serologically distinguished from each other; however, FECV infection is normally asymptomatic in cats. It was recently reported that FECV and FIPV may be distinguished based on the base sequences of the ORF 2 (S gene) and 3c genes (Bank-Wolf et al., 2014, Licitra et al., 2013, Pedersen et al., 2012, Porter et al., 2014).",

            "text": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha binds to cell surface TNF receptors (TNFR) and induces various physiological activities (Vandenabeele et al., 1995; Reinhard et al., 1997). For example, when it binds to cell surface TNFR-1, caspase is activated and induces apoptosis, and when it binds to cell surface TNFR-2, transcription factors, such as NF-kB and c-Jun, are activated that promote cell proliferation and induce the expression of cytokines involved in immunity and inflammation (Faustman and Davis, 2010, Tracey et al., 2008). TNF-alpha plays a critical role in many aspects of immunity. However, the excessive production of TNF-alpha can lead to acute inflammation and immune system abnormalities in human and other animals. The involvement of TNF-alpha in aggravating the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease has been reported (Kollias et al., 1999, Brotas et al., 2012; Wang and Fu, 2005). Moreover, previous studies have described aggravation of the pathologies of viral infections (such as human immunodeficiency virus, influenza A virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV) and dengue virus infections) due to increased TNF-alpha production (Fauci, 1993, Maury and L\u0103hdevirta, 1990, Poli et al., 1990, Uchide et al., 2012; Yen et al., 2008).",

This anti fTNF-alpha mAb exhibited high neutralizing activity against recombinant and natural TNF-alpha, and was confirmed to inhibit the following fTNF-alpha-induced conditions in vitro: i) an increase in the survival rate of neutrophils from cats with FIP, ii) APN mRNA expression in macrophages, and iii) apoptosis of a feline T-lymphocyte cell line (Doki et al., 2013).",

PBS or mAb 2\u20134 (3 mg/kg) were intravenously administered to groups A and B, respectively, 2 weeks after the virus inoculation. Cats were examined daily for clinical signs, and their body temperatures and weights were measured. Blood was collected weekly using a heparinized syringe after the virus inoculation, and complete and differential cell counts were measured. FIP diagnoses were confirmed upon postmortem examination, revealing peritoneal and pleural effusions, and pyogranuloma in the major organs. The protocol for the experiments in the present study using cats was approved by the Ethics Committee of Kitasato University, School of Veterinary Medicine (Approval No. 13-087).",

Fewer than 50% of Type I FIPV-inoculated cats develop FIP. In our previous experiment, when the type I FIPV strain KU-2 was orally, subcutaneously, and intraperitoneally administered, the incidences of FIP were 0, 20, and 50% (unpublished data), respectively, suggesting that when type I FIPV is used, the incidence is not stable and the therapeutic effect cannot be accurately judged.

Since no such mouse mAb was available, we used the solvent of anti-fTNF-alpha mAb, PBS, as a placebo.

We previously reported that TNF-alpha produced by FIPV-infected macrophages efficiently induced the apoptosis of T-lymphocytes, particularly CD8 + T-lymphocytes (Takano et al., 2007a). In the present study, decreases in the numbers of CD4 + and CD8 + T-lymphocytes were noted from 7 days after the FIPV inoculation, but recovered in 2 out of the 3 cats treated with mAb 2\u20134. The TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis of CD4 + and CD8 + T-lymphocytes may have been reduced by mAb 2\u20134, i.e., a cellular immune response against FIPV may have been induced and maintained.",

            "text": "Various drugs to treat FIP have been investigated. Since FIP is a viral disease, treatments with antiviral agents (anti-FIPV drugs) have been examined (Hartmann and Ritz, 2008). On the other hand, treatments with anti-inflammatory drugs, represented by steroids, have also been tested because FIP is an inflammatory disease. However, existing anti-FIPV and anti-inflammatory drugs only transiently improve FIP symptoms, and do not improve survival times or quality of life (Hartmann and Ritz, 2008). MAb 2\u20134 improved the survival time and quality of life of cats with FIP; however, one of the 3 mAb 2\u20134-treated cats developed FIP. Thus, further investigations are necessary to determine its applicability as a therapeutic drug for FIP. We considered the combination of the above anti-FIPV drugs and mAb 2\u20134 to have improved therapeutic effects on FIP. The therapeutic effects of the combination of an anti-TNF-alpha antibody and anti-HSV drugs on HSV infection were previously reported to be high (Boivin et al., 2013). Regarding HSV infection, anti-HSV drugs such as acyclovir that only target the factors essential for viral replication have been developed. This type of drug has recently been developed for FIPV, for which future studies are expected (Hsieh et al., 2010). The treatment of FIP with a combination of these drugs warrants further investigation.",

However, it may be necessary to investigate the multiple administration of mouse mAb 2\u20134 to cats in which a therapeutic effect is only temporarily exhibited, as noted in cat No. B3. Since administration of mouse mAb 2\u20134 leads to anti-mouse mAb response to cats, it may cause anaphylactic reactions as an adverse effect, reductions in the therapeutic effects, and shortening of the half-life from second administration of mouse mAb 2\u20134. Umehashi et al. (2002) reported that the administration of a mAb with a constant region converted to the feline form (a mouse-feline chimeric antibody) did not induce an anaphylactic reaction. Based on this finding, we modified mAb 2\u20134 to a mouse-feline chimeric antibody, and are now evaluating its effects. Furthermore, we will need to prepare Fab-fragment which removed Fc portion of mAb 2\u20134.",
