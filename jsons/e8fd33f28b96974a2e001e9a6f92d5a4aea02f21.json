Our aim was to evaluate in septic shock patients compared to postoperative control patients with known risk factors for IAH: (a) the incidence and time course of IAH during early ICU stay; and (b) the consequences of IAH in lactate levels, maximum SOFA and norepinephrine requirements.",

Agreement on LET attitudes, between the attending medical team and the patient's representatives was present in 63 % of cases, and in the 18 % the LET was decided only on professional-technical reasons. In those cases, medical decision was also informed to relatives. The number of patients being discharged from the ICU in whom LET was established was 26 (22 %). Withholding approaches were more than three times higher than withdrawing indications. Shorten of death process, was performed in 12 patients (10 % of LET).

Spinal immobilisation consists of a hard collar, headblocks and tape immobisation.This immobilisation is maintained until the cervical spine can be cleared of injury. Often this relies on the patient being able to co-operate with a neurological examination. Following head trauma some patients may never regain sufficient neurological ability to co-operate with an examination. Others may remain obtunded for some time. Until the spine is cleared the patient needs to be log-rolled and turned in accordance with spinal care bundles. Complications such as pressure sores can ensue if this is not followed. Evidence has also shown that removal of the cervical spine collar in head injured patients improves venous drainage from the head and so is beneficial in managing intracranial pressure1.We therefore need an approach to clearing the spine in obtunded multisystem trauma patients.",

The aim of this study was to suggest how the computation of \u00c4SID should be sophisticated in order to obtain a good correspondence with BE in ICU patients. CONCLUSION. The rigorous computation of the corrected \u00c4SID seems to be necessary in the ICU population, because of non-neglectable concentration of unmeasured anions and of diffuse and serious hypoalbuminemia in these patients. Moreover, \u00c4SID is a measure of plasma buffer base variation, so it should be compared with an equivalent BE formulation, that is plasma BE.",

Per respondent per year, an average of 975 anesthetics were performed, with 638 patients having endotracheal intubation. The most frequently preferred laryngoscope blade was Macintosh (75%) followed by Miller (21%) and McCoy (4%). 83% indicated they rarely failed an intubation using a conventional laryngoscope. In difficult airway situations, following laryngoscopy, the technique of choice was the laryngeal mask airway followed by the gum elastic bougie. For anticipated difficult intubations, 54% performed sedated awake intubation, and 29% used the flexible bronchoscope. While the ASA difficult airway algorithm was used by 42% of respondents, 25% stated that they used an internally developed difficult airway protocol.",

CONCLUSION. Significantly lower inflammatory response was detected in patients initially in VF arrest, with significantly better survival compared to PEA arrest, although anoxic time and time to ROSC was similar in the two groups as reflected by nearly identical S100B levels. However, patients with PEA arrest often have long, undetected hypoxic period, which may trigger the release of inflammatory markers such as PCT.

Pleural aspiration was removed when the patient had thoracic pain, cough or fluid flow ceased.

We compared ICU mortality with APACHE II predicted mortality and calculated the standardized mortality ratio (SMR). RESULTS. Over the 6 year period, 2,481 patients were admitted into the ICU. Forty-nine(2%)were transferred from another ICU, 124(5%)were transferred from areas outside the ICU in other hospitals and 2308 (93%) were admitted from our own hospital. Mortality figures are shown in the table. CONCLUSION. Lipid solutions enriched with w-3 fatty acids are safe, well tolerated in patients with ARDS, and without changes in the hemodynamic or gas exchange of these patients.",

Neurosurgical patients are particulary vulnerable and susceptible to develop an infection because of the severity of their illness,the presence of associated trauma and use of invasive technique and devices. METHODS. In this paper 30 patients who underwent naurosurgical procedure for vascular malformations,were observed.All patients were treated in the ICU with mechanical ventilation and vital functions support,depending on patient condition.We have analyzed the possible influence of following factors:Duration of the operation,period of intubation,esthablished IV and arterial lines,urinary catheter and preoperative infection of certain organ system RESULTS. 20 of these 30 patients developed infection after a mean stay of 5.5 days int he ICU.There were 6 patients with CNS infection,8 patients with respiratory tract infection,6 patients with urinary tract infection. 2 patients died and other recovered well.Streptoccus viridans was the predominant organism isolated,followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E.coli,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Pseudomonas species. CONCLUSION. The goal of this paper is to establish the influence of above mentioned factors on development of infection of certain organ system in early postoperative course in the neurosurgical ICU.Some of the patients developed signs of infection which prolonged their stay in ICU and significantly postponed their recovery following the operation. This has increased the cost of their treatment. REFERENCE(S). BerrouaneY,Daudenthun I,Riegel B and all,Early onset pneumonia in neurosurgical intensive care unit patients.

To determine the incidence of fungal colonization and infection in critically ill patients.METHODS.It is a prospective study during 30 months of the patients admitted in ICU during 24 hours o more. Were taken throat swab, tracheal aspirate and urine on admission and twice weekly. Were registered the fungal colonization and infection. Infections were diagnosed according to CDC criteria. Infections were classified bassed on thorat flora as: Primary endogenous (PE) when were caused by germs that were already colonizing the throat on the ICU admission; Secondary endogenous (SE) when were caused by germs that were not colonizing the throat on the ICU admission but were acquired during the stay in ICU; Exogenous (EX) when were caused by germs which were not colonizing the throat. Infections were classified bassed on the onset moment as: Early onset (EO-developed during the first 4 days of ICU-stay) and Late onset (LO-developed 5 days after ICU-admission).CONCLUSION. The most of fungal infections had a late onset, were secundary endogenous and were due to candida albicans.

The assessment of energy expenditure (EE) in critically ill trauma patients is a challenge. The gold standard for evaluation is indirect calorimetry (IC). Its use is not generalized and several regression equations are used to estimate patient's energetic needs. Our aim was to compare different methods for assessment of EE in trauma patients.METHODS.This study was conducted in an ICU of a university hospital during one year in trauma patients. Illness severity was evaluated by TRISS methodology, SOFA and SAPS II. IC was performed in the first 48 hours for evaluation of the EE and the estimated energy expenditure was calculated by Harris-Benedict, Fleisch, Ireton-Jones for ventilated patients and Frankenfield equations. Statistical analises was made using SPSS.RESULTS.We included 31 patients, 4 women, 27 men aged 18-77 years. SOFA, ISS and SAPS II mean score were 7.0\u00b12.3, 29.9\u00b110.0, 33.6\u00b112.6. Mean body mass index was 25.8\u00b15.3 kg/m2. A strong correlation (r>0.7) was found between several methods being the strongest between Harris-Benedict and Frankenfield equations (r=0.846 p<0.001). The method that best correlated with IC in this specific trauma sample was Frankenfields equation (r=0.807 p<0.001). Comparing IC with Harris-Benedict equation results we found a mean ratio of 1.24, as shown inTable 1.",

From patients with confirmed VAP the following microorganisms were isolated: from gastric content: P.aeruginosa, A.baumanii, P.mirabilis, E.aerogenes, E.coli, E.faecalis, MSSE, MSSA; from upper respiratory tract: P.aeruginosa, A.baumanii, P.mirabilis, E.aerogenes, E.coli, E.faecalis, MSSA, MSSE, Streptococcus spp.; from lower respiratory tract: P.aeruginosa, A.baumanii, P.mirabilis, E.aerogenes, MSSA. Microorganisms from lower respiratory tract were isolated in number >10 6 CFU/ml and from gastric content in number >106 CFU/ml. 62,1% of all the gastric isolates were Gram-negative bacteria.CONCLUSION.

Fulfilling one or more of the criteria for calling the MET 2 team had a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 36% for being an appropriate referral. The referral of patients who had been investigated with >4 basic techniques (venous or arterial blood, CXR, urinary catheter, IV fluids if appropriate, cannula sited, central line) was significantly more appropriate than those who had received <3 investigative techniques (p=0.003). Discussing the patient with the responsible consultant prior to referral increased the appropriateness from 44% to 70%. Combining consultant discussion with >4 investigations resulted in an 80% appropriate referral rate; not discussing with their consultant and carrying out <3 investigations resulted in a 29% appropriate referral rate.CONCLUSION.Of the 2.3 referrals received by our ICU each day 38% were deemed inappropriate, the factors contributing to which being: not discussing the patient with the responsible consultant, inadequately investigating patients prior to contact with ICU and not fulfilling one or more of the calling criteria for the MET team (together accounting for 89% of inappropriate referrals).

Five General Hospitals in WesternMacedonia serve the Health Services needs of a population of 301.522 inhabitants. Bodosakeio General Hospital is the only one in the region to provide critical care. The objective of our study was to determine whether different accessibility to the ICU among hospitals within this region predicts outcome.METHODS. ICU records of transferred patients from the wards of Bodosakeio Hospital and from the wards of outside hospitals were retrospectively analyzed for a 3 years period (Apr 02-Apr 05). Extracted data concerned age, sex, ward LOS, diagnosis, APACHE II and TISS score, processes of care, ICU mortality and ICU LOS. A matching analysis was also performed based on sex, age and diagnosis. Patients from the E.R or O.R or another ICU were excluded.RESULTS. 210 patients (43,12% of total admissions) were transferred, 146 from wards within Bodosakeio and 64 from the other four hospitals (mean transport distance 60 km).

The operative level of care was calculated dividing the measured TISS points equivalent to the nursing activities of one nurse per shift. The efficiency in the use of nursing manpower was based on the number of available nurses, the amount of work that one nurse can perform per shift and the level of TISS during the study. The work utilization ratio was calculated. Severity of illness was evaluated by the APACHE II score. CONCLUSION. The APACHE II score remained elevated through the study period.

Clinical pharmacologists have estimated the strenght of relationship between drug(s) prescribed in hospital and potential avoidable ADR as the cause of organ failure.RESULTS. Of 344 patients admitted from medical ICU between may and october 2003, 48 (13,4%) were hospitalised because of almost one organ failure related to ADR, 31% of cases ADR were potentially avoidable. Coma, seizures with acute respiratory failure and metabolic life-threatening disorders were the most frequently avoidable ADR and linked to drugs prescribed in a short delay before admission. Artificial life support was required in 83% of cases.Vasopressives drugs were prescribed in 12 cases , hemodialysis in 5, non invasive ventilation in 12, and mechanical ventilation was needed in 16 cases.The Mean of Simplified Acute Physiologic Score II of work load Omega score, of length of stay and the rate of mortality were not significantly different between patients with or without ADR.",

In our serie, the donor\u00b4s NE dose did not have an influence on the heart graft disfunction or in the others items assessed. The NE use for hemodynamic management on heart donors could not worsen the recipients evolution, but new studies with high number of patiemts should be developed in order to set a clear limit in the dosage used.",

We found out the rate of complicated wound healing 12,3% (all sites and grades). There was significantly higher rate of complicated wound healing (28,3% vs. 7% p<0,0001) and longer ICU stay (51,6 vs. 24,2 hrs., p<0,01) in group in risk compared to group without risk.

We identified diabetes, COPD and nutritional risk as to be preoperative independent risk factors of impaired healing in elective cardiac surgery by multivariate analysis.CONCLUSION. Cardiac surgery patients have a similar prevalence of nutritional risk as general population of patients. Simple screening form is able to identify group of patients in increased risk of impaired healing. Maximum SOFA during first three days (maxSOFA3d) and deltaSOFA between first and third postoperative days (deltaSOFA31) revealed to have strongest correlation to mortality (p=0.005, ROC area 0.793 and p=0.006, ROC area 0.0784 respectively). The maxSOFA3d of 15 points corresponded to mortality with sensitivity of 0.000 and specificity of 0.012. MaxSOFA3d correlated to the ICU stay (p=0.001).CONCLUSION. The sequential assessment of organ dysfunction during the first three days postoperatively is an independent predictor of mortality and morbidity in cardiac surgery patients.",

Thromboleastography (TEG) is reliable and extensively used method of haemostasis monitoring. Using TEG as a bed-side method, we are able to detect a coagulation disorders, especially hypercoagulation and fibrinolysis METHODS. In prospective randomized study two groups of elective cardiac surgery patients were compared. Patients of Group A (n=144) were monitored both conventional lab tests and simultaneously with TEG. The following TEG measurements were performed: 1st -baseline after the anesthesia induction, 2th-at rewarming on CPB (with heparinase) and 3th-immediately after ICU admission (both nativ and heparinase). Patients of Group B (n=146) were monitored only using lab tests. Pre and postoperative coagulation status, incidence of thrombocytopenia, fibrinolysis,blood loss , transfusion therapy, surgical reexploration were evaluated. Changes of hemostatic profile using TEG diagnostic algorithm and also changes of pre-and postop.lab tests were evaluated RESULTS. Both groups were comparable by age (66,1/67,4) , male gender (72%,7/ 68,5%) and surgery type. The lab coagulation tests including platelet count were within normal range in both groups before surgery. No diference between both groups were recorded in : average blood loss during and postoperative, incidence of surgical reexploration because of bleednig , red blood cell, fresh frozen plasma and platelet transfusion and using of aprotinin. In both groups lab values of Quick test, platelet count and fibrinogen were lower and aPTT and TT were higher after surgery. The changes of TEG parameters characterised by coagulation index : CI1>CI2, CI1<CI3. Frequency of coagulagulation patterns: TEG 1 : enzymatic hypercoaguability 14,1%, platelet hypercoag. 13,3%, sec.fibrinolysis 9,4%. TEG 2 : low platelet function 14,1%, primary fibrinolysis 14,1%, low clotting factors 7,8%. TEG 3 (heparinase): enzymatic hypercoag.. 9,4%, platelet hypercoag. 9,4%, low platelet function 9,4%. Only one parameter-Quick test value(%) correlated with ECC duration (R-0,23, p<0,01)in both groups.",

B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and its N-terminal portion (NT-proBNP) may be useful in the assessment of cardiac preload in patients with chronic heart failure. However, it remains controversial whether or not this option is still valid in critically ill patients. To resolve this question we sought to establish the relationship between natriuretic peptide levels and surrogates of cardiac preload and inflammation in this kind of population.METHODS. This retrospective study included 12 critically ill patients with heart failure and/or refractory shock, all monitored with a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC). Linear correlations between hemodynamic and laboratory parameters were performed using relative differences and described by the Pearson correlation coefficient (r). A mixed linear model for repeated measurement was used to control for repeated effects.",

The aim of this review was to compare the current fine-bore feeding tube used within the critical care directorate (CCD), Medicina (Entrafeed, 7fg or ENG) with that manufactured by Merck, (Corflo, 8fg or CNG). It was hypothesised that as a result of the specific features of the CNG tube, it would be easier to aspirate; reduce the incidence of occlusions; and have increased radio opacity when compared with the ENG.METHODS. An audit proforma was completed for 41 patients who had a fine-bore feeding tube placed within the CCD: 20(ENG); 21(CNG) placed.
