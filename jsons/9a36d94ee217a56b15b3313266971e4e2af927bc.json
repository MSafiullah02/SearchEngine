Here, we report an ARD outbreak caused by HAdV-7 in a military training camp in Shaanxi Province, China, from February to March of 2012. Epidemic data and samples from the patients were collected, and viral nucleotides from samples and viral isolations were detected and sequenced. IgG and IgA antibodies against HAdV, and the neutralization antibodies against the viral strain isolated in this outbreak, were detected. Epidemiological study showed that all personnel affected were males with an average age of 19.1 years. Two peaks appeared on the epicurve and there was an 8-day interval between peaks. Laboratory results of viral nucleotide detection carried out with clinical specimens were positive for HAdV (83.33%, 15/18). Further study through serum antibody assay, virus isolation and phylogenetic analysis showed that HAdV-7 was the etiological agent responsible for the outbreak. IgA antibody began to appear on the 4th day after the onset and showed 100% positivity on the 8th day. The virus strain in the present outbreak was highly similar to the virus isolated in Hanzhong Shaanxi in 2009.

These isolated viral strains were further confirmed by specific PCR. The entire hexon gene (3116 bp) of three strains (Genbank accession number KC689913-KC689915) was highly identical with each other (99.9-100%).Phylogenetic analysis based on the entire hexon gene of isolated strains in this study as well as 17 viral strains representing the seven HAdV species and 29 strains belonging to HAdV B showed that isolates from this study belonged to HAdV-7 and had high homology with the HAdV HZ/SHX/CHN/2009 (GU230898) strain (Fig. 3)(6).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "Case distribution in a military training camp during an outbreak of HAdV-7.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "Antibody concentration against HAdV in 30 paired sera.
