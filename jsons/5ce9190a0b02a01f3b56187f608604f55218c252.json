The result of a test can be negative for two reasons: either the individual is infected but the test shows wrong (with probability (1 \u2212 s)) or the individual is not infected and the test gives the right result (with probability (1 \u2212 )s ). The fact that the n tests are independent leads directly to Equation (3). In Equation (3) the probability of missing an infection in a population is computed extracting the sample with replacement (Bernoullian extraction).

However, if the prevalence is low, the positive predictive value of the test decreases quickly when the speci\u00ffcity gets lower, so that testing is not e ective for a clinical diagnosis.

A diagnostic test with speci\u00ffcity s = 1 and sensitivity s = 0:75 is available (the values are chosen in agreement with Reference [6] ). From Figure 4 one can see that, if n = 80 passengers are tested, the probability P of missing SARS is estimated from 10 to 20 per cent. Vice versa, requiring P to be around 1 per cent the number n of passengers that must be tested is about 140. If P is required to be less than 0.001, the number of passengers tested must be greater than 180. If the airplane comes from a region where SARS prevalence is 1 per cent, even if all 200 passengers are tested the probability P of not detecting SARS amounts from 5 to 10 per cent. The high values come from the fact that the sensitivity of the diagnostic test is low and many dangerous false negative people cannot be prevented from di using the infection. One could consider the possibility of testing pools of blood, instead of performing single diagnostic tests. In such a way costs could be saved. However the pooling procedure is not so appealing when the speci\u00ffcity of the diagnostic test is s = 1 [5] , as in our case, because in this situation the results of pool testing is always worse than the ones of individual testing. Furthermore, pool testing is very useful in assessing the prevalence of a disease in a population (when this prevalence is supposed to be low), but not for individual diagnosis, which is the target in the case of SARS.",

This calculation is not appropriate when the proportion\u02c6 is obtained as a result of a non-perfect diagnostic test. In this case the frequentistic con\u00ffdence interval must be constructed with the correction given in Reference [5] . An alternative approach is the Bayesian credible interval, which allows to take into account prior information of epidemiological and medical type. One should point out that the meaning of frequentistic and Bayesian intervals is di erent. A proportion lies actually in its 95 per cent Bayesian interval with probability 95 per cent, while from a frequentistic perspective one assumes that, constructing for many samples the 95 per cent con\u00ffdence intervals, approximately 95 per cent of them will contain the proportion value.",

Therefore, before planning an expensive screening program at entry points of a country, one should \u00ffrst of all have a highly sensitive screening test at one's disposal. This is not always the case when a disease outbreaks. Furthermore, the procedure of testing should be the less invasive as possible, in order to prevent a dramatic decrease of tourism with heavy economic consequences, not justi\u00ffed by the real impact of a low prevalence disease. It appears that, in most cases, border entry screening is more e ective in keeping public concern low than in stopping the infection to enter a country.
