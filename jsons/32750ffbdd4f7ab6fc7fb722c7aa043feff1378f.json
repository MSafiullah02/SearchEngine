Proteins have kept or gained their functions during molecular evolution. Their functions seem to be flexible, and a few amino acid substitutions sometimes cause drastic changes in function. In order to monitor and predict such drastic changes in the early stages in target populations, we need to identify patterns of structural changes during molecular evolution causing decreases or increases in the binding affinity of protein complexes. In previous work, we developed a likelihood-based index to quantify the degree to which a sequence fits a given structure. This index was named the sequence-structure fitness (SSF) and is calculated empirically based on amino acid preferences and pairwise interactions in the structural environment present in template structures. In the present work, we used the SSF to develop an index to measure the binding affinity of protein-protein complexes defined as the log likelihood ratio, contrasting the fitness of the sequences to the structure of the complex and that of the uncomplexed proteins. We applied the developed index to the complexes formed between influenza A hemagglutinin (HA) and four antibodies. The antibody-antigen binding region of HA is under strong selection pressure by the host immune system. Hence, examination of the long-term adaptation of HA to the four antibodies could reveal the strategy of the molecular evolution of HA. Two antibodies cover the HA receptor-binding region, while the other two bind away from the receptor-binding region. By focusing on branches with a significant decline in binding ability, we could detect key amino acid replacements and investigate the mechanism via conditional probabilities. The contrast between the adaptations to the two types of antibodies suggests that the virus adapts to the immune system at the cost of structural change.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Many biological functions are predominantly controlled by protein-protein interactions, and molecular recognition phenomena are essential to biological systems.

Natural killer (NK) cells-one of the lymphocyte classes-detect downregulation of MHC class I molecules by means of specific membrane receptors. A main category of these receptors is the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) family.

The binding ability to the A/Finland/247/92 isolate was completely lost (the result of Equation 1 was negative). Along these two branches, the binding ability decreased by a different mechanism. At the first branch, the decrease in binding ability was caused by the amino acid replacement G158E in HA1. The interaction between the one hundred fifty-eighth site in HA1 and the CDR2H and CDR3L regions of the Fab largely decreased their strength. Furthermore, glutamic acid (E, acidic amino acid) does not prefer to be buried. As a result, the FSR of the one hundred fiftyeighth site in HA1 decreased from logFSR\u00f0158G\u00de50:83 to logFSR\u00f0158E\u00de5 \u00c0 0:77.

The interaction between the one hundred fifty-eighth site in HA1 and the CDR1H and CDR2H regions of the Fab largely decreased their strength. In this case, leucine (L, a nonpolar amino acid) prefers to be buried. However, the decrease in the interaction strength was larger than the contribution of the one hundred fifty-eighth site's burial preference. The FSR of the one hundred fifty-eighth site in HA1 decreased from logFSR\u00f0157S\u00de50:65 to logFSR\u00f0157L\u00de5 \u00c00:49. In the case of antibody HC63, the binding ability was completely lost over a period of 5 years (from A/Rotterdam/ 577/80 to A/Wellington/4/85). Along the evolutionary pathway of HA, after complete loss, the binding ability started to increase and against A/Netherlands/179/93 was restored to almost the same strength as against A/Aichi/ 68. The binding ability then decreased again and was completely lost against A/Netherlands/22/03. This repetitive decrease in the binding ability was not a trivial regression. At the first complete loss of the binding ability in figure 5D , the complex between the A/Rotterdam/577/80 isolate and the HC63 Fab significantly decreased the affinity between the one hundred thirty-seventh residue and the CDR3H region by the amino acid replacement N137Y when comparing the complex between A/Aichi/68 and HC63. During the regression, the tyrosine (Y) at the one hundred thirtyseventh residue was retained, and the balance of hydropathy on HA increased its contribution to the affinity of the complex (result of Equation 4). At the second complete loss of binding ability, the dominant contribution to the decrease of the affinity of the complex between A/Netherlands/22/03 and HC63 was from the amino acid replacement G225D in HA1. The affinity between the two hundred twenty-fifth residue and the CDR3H region decreased significantly when comparing the complex between A/Aichi/68 and HC63.

This implies that the organization of hydrogen bonds and the strength of the hydrophobic interaction are the result of the complicated process of protein docking. Because of these changes in microstructure via rotation of side chains, accurately predicting the complex structure from the structure of uncomplexed HA and Fab is difficult (Jenwitheesuk and Samudrala 2003) . Therefore, we decided to extract grossly the change in microstructures reflected by the extent of the amino acid preference in the local environment. The change in the ability of rotation of the side chains is expected to be at least partly detected as a change in the log likelihood ratios.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 163, "end": 183, "text": "(Fleury et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 809, "end": 842, "text": "(Jenwitheesuk and Samudrala 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The decline in antibody binding activity is a wellknown behavior of H3N2 viruses. However, compared with the two antibodies HC45 and BH151, the monoclonal antibodies HC19 and HC63, which bind to the receptor-binding region and cover the receptor binding sites, have totally different features. Both of these antibodies completely lost their binding ability for a period of time on the evolutionary pathway of HA. After this complete loss of binding ability, antibody HC63 started to increase its ability, and over 10 years, the ability to bind to HA was restored. When the virus was free from antibody HC63, amino acid substitutions accumulated, and they enabled antibody HC63 to again bind to the same epitope region. However, the amino acid substitutions were not simply back mutations of the substitutions causing reduced binding ability. Irreversible sequence evolution appears to have occurred through coordinated or covariational substitutions at different sites that compensated for the effects on the structural characteristics (Nakajima et al. 2005) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1036, "end": 1058, "text": "(Nakajima et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our findings seem to suggest that influenza HA endeavors to keep some of its structural features, such as its physicochemical characteristics, that do not require the specific single amino acid sequence of HA. This is functional redundancy, and antibodies employ this feature to bind to the HA surface. One of the remarkable properties of binding between proteins is redundancy (Dang, Nikolajczyk, and Sen 1998) , a term for the feature where mutations at several protein-binding sites do not affect the affinity of the complex (Fields et al. 1995) . In general, the physicochemical characteristics of protein are known to be evolutionarily conserved (Afonnikov, Oshchepkov, and Kolchanov 2001) . By functional redundancy of antibodies, different antibodies whose variable domains display low sequence identities can bind to the same epitope region on HA. Hence, it may be true that antibodies do not require specific amino acid sequences of the epitope region on HA. The HA sequence, particularly in the receptor-binding region, changes under the selective pressure of the host immune system. After disarmament of the immune system, the HA protein regresses to the functionally same structural state as the original protein. Then the disarmed antibody can again bind to its epitope on HA, and HA sequence evolution is again under selective pressure. During the antibody's period of impotency, the other antibody that bound to the closely related epitope region preserved its ability to bind to the epitopes. This ''arms race'' is a competition between the virus's changing the sequences of the epitope regions at the cost of structural change and the immune system's producing sets of functionally redundant antibodies.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 378, "end": 411, "text": "(Dang, Nikolajczyk, and Sen 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 528, "end": 548, "text": "(Fields et al. 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 651, "end": 694, "text": "(Afonnikov, Oshchepkov, and Kolchanov 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The final remark regards future studies.
