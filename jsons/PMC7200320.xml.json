Table 1 outlines the medications currently approved in the USA for malaria prophylaxis and specific considerations for each medication.Standby emergency treatment (SBET): While chemoprophylaxis is the most efficacious in malaria prevention, SBET has also become an option for travelers who are traveling to low-risk areas who do not want to take chemoprophylaxis for the duration of their travel. Patients using this method should begin taking prescribed antimalarials if they develop a fever and seek a medical evaluation as soon as possible.\n\n",
