The neonatal diarrhoeic syndrome caused by Cryptosporidium parvum is usually observed in 5\u201335-day-old claves with maximum incidence in the second week of life [3], resulting in enormous direct and indirect economic loss to dairy industry [4\u20136]. In addition to bovine calves, it is known to infect humans, domestic and wild animals, and birds [7\u201311]. The cryptosporidia, highly resistant to harsh environmental conditions, transmitted by faeco-oral route, have attained an increased zoonotic importance posing a great risk to dairy workers, milk handlers and general public through water contamination. The disease has particularly generated a great public health interest after a large human waterborne outbreak in Milwaukee in 1993 [11, 12].",

Traditionally, the infectious agents of diarrhoea have been identified using conventional techniques [14, 15]. However, these techniques are labour intensive, time consuming and less sensitive; therefore, advanced diagnostic methods may prove more efficacious in determining the precise aetiology of calf diarrhoea complex and thereby helpful in planning strategies for better herd management, disease surveillance and control programmes.",

Studies on Cryptosporidium in the country have mainly focused on the morphological identification of oocysts in faeces [5, 7, 8, 11, 16\u201320] with little emphasis on immunomolecular methods [21\u201324]. These previous investigations were concentrated on isolated reports of cryptosporidia alone without an insight into multiple aetiologies. Even globally, very few studies have been conducted on Cryptosporidium-associated complex aetiology of bovine calf diarrhoea outbreaks [6, 25]. In fact very few comprehensive investigations ellucidating the most recognised agents, viz. protozoa (C. parvum, Eimeria spp.) viruses (rota and corona) and bacteria (E. coli, Salmonella spp., Clostridium perfringens) have been attempted [26\u201330]. Moreover, a comparative evaluation of multiple aetiological factors by traditional, immunological and molecular methods with a pursuit to determine their relative sensitivity using faecal samples is lacking. The present study deals with 17 periurban outbreaks of bovine calf diarrhoea investigated thoroughly comparing faecal examination, faecal ELISA and faecal PCR (most trusted methods) from 100 cases with 43% mortality.",

The Leishman-stained smears proved highly useful in preliminary screening of faecal smears for the presence or absence of coocidia, particularly cryptosporidia. Morphometric analysis of oocysts of Cryptosporidium (n = 10; 10 field each sample) in Leishman (4\u00b724 \u00b1 0\u00b728 \u00b5m) and mZN-stained (4\u00b726 \u00b1 0\u00b729 \u00b5m) faecal smears revealed non-significant (0\u00b716 NS) variation in the size. In the Romanowsky-stained faecal smears, the cryptosporidial oocysts were seen as hollow round bodies and with a size compatible with that recorded in this study and documented earlier by mZN staining [33] and the coocidian oocysts were larger hollows and oval (Fig.1a, b); but on mZN staining, cryptosporidial oocysts were seen as bright red, oval to spherical bodies in 25% cases (Fig. 1c; Table 2). Both the faecal antigen-ELISA and PCR showed an improved 35% prevalence of Cryptosporidium in diarrhoeic calves. In fact, direct visualisation by light microscopy of cryptosporidia in faeces or intestinal contents as well as the detection of its antigens (e.g. Ag-ELISA) or nucleic acids (e.g. PCR) in specimens have been widely accepted as alternative diagnostic methods [9, 34].\n\n\n",

The maximal prevalence of Cryptosporidium was recoded in the 2-week-old diarrhoeic bovine calves. Similar prevalence of cryptosporidial infection in neonatal diarrhoeic calves with a gradual reduction with age has been reported previously from various regions of India [5, 21, 22, 35] and across the globe [27, 36\u201339]. In the present study, all calves positive by faecal ELISA were also positive for the Cryptosporidium by PCR, except one. The sensitivity of ELISA and mZN staining with respect to PCR was 97\u00b714% and 72\u00b772%, respectively (Table 4). Comparable results regarding sensitivity between ELISA and PCR, matching those of ours, were previously recorded by other workers [25, 40] irrespective of the variations in the type of reagents and kits used. Settawy and Fathy [41] observed high detection rate by PCR (24\u00b74%) and low by microscopy (18\u00b76%), while it was 20\u00b79% by ELISA. Their data showing higher sensitivity of PCR compared with ELISA are contradictory to our results showing equivalent positivity. In the differentiation of the aetiology of the diarrhoea in neonatal calves, PCR is being increasingly employed for the detection of Cryptosporidium during the last two decades mainly because of its accuracy, specificity and sensitivity and it has made significant contributions in understanding the epidemiology of Cryptosporidium infection [42\u201346]. Moreover PCR has added advantages such as ease of use, ability to analyse large numbers of samples simultaneously, relatively low cost and ability to speciate (eliminating false positives and cross-reactions of antibodies to non-pathogenic species) [45]. Though nested PCR involving a second round of amplifications has been applied to Cryptosporidium to increase specificity and sensitivity [35, 47, 48], yet it has not been generally recommended for use in diagnostic laboratories owing to a major risk of contamination with PCR products [45, 49].\n",

Majority of the cases, in this study, showed as many as 13 combinations of Cryptosporidium-associated infections (71\u00b740%) with Cryptosporidium alone in 28\u00b760% diarrhoeic calves only (Table 5). Moreover, the age-wise faecal prevalence of Cryptosporidium as a single agent and combination aetiologies with it, showed a decreasing and increasing trend (\u03c72 13\u00b728, P < 0\u00b701), respectively (Table 5). This indicates that initial primary infection with Cryptosporidium led to significant enterocytic damage favouring flare up of other secondary infections with the passage of time. In addition, the findings of severe intestinal epithelial damage (Fig. 3), lymphoid depletion in mesenteric lymph nodes (Fig. 4) and demonstration of Cryptosporidium along with coccidiosis (eimeriosis) (Fig. 5) were amply augmented by histopathology of the representative tissue samples collected from calf mortality during the outbreaks. Histopathology is considered as a gold standard for demonstrating the intestinal involvement and cryptosporidia in one go in the animals dying of diarrhoeal disease [6]. Furthermore, the haematobiochemical findings of significant neutrophilic leucocytosis, lymphopaenia and anaemia along with significant increase in serum albumin and blood urea nitrogen with corresponding significant decrease in total globulins hinted at secondary suppurative infection, dehydration and immunosuppression, respectively, as have been reported by the authors earlier [52, 53]. Contrary to our findings, de la Fuente et al. [27] reported a significant age-associated decrease in the detection rate of mixed infections. In fact, the epidemiological studies have proven that diarrhoea is more severe in mixed infection(s), especially in immunocompromised individuals [54]. In this study, the Cryptosporidium-associated pathogens responsible for bovine calf scour outbreaks and mortality were C. perfringens 45\u00b771% (16/25), followed by Salmonella spp 40\u00b70% (10/25), rotavirus 36\u00b70% (9/25), coronavirus 16\u00b70% (4/25), E. coli 12\u00b70% (3/25) and Eimeria spp. 4\u00b70% (1/4), respectively, which fell nearly in line with that for C. perfringens (54\u00b70%) and in contrast to rotavirus (87%), coronavirus (11\u00b71%), E. coli (27\u00b78%) and Salmonella spp. (1\u00b78%) in central Spain [55]. Almost similar infection rate of Cryptosporidium (21\u00b728%) with Blastocystis 19\u00b715%, Giardia (51\u00b706%) and Enterocytozoon 36\u00b717%, although in a higher 3\u20135-month age group of diarrhoeic calves was reported [30]. The severity of Cryptosporidium in combination with other agents, or whether other agents extend the risk period for clinical cryptosporidiosis remains to be proved further experimentally [27]. The prevalence of each of pathogen and disease incidence can vary due to geographical location of the farms, farm managemental practices and herd size. A heavy mortality of 43% was recorded in the present study. A similar high mortality has been reported due to diarrhoea in the USA (57%) and Korea (53\u00b74%) in unweaned dairy calves [56\u201357].\n\n\n\n\n",
