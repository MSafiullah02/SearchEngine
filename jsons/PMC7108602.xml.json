            "text": "Mannan-binding lectin (MBL), a member of collectins which belong to C-type lectin superfamily, is an important pattern-recognition receptor in the innate immune system (1, 2). The overall polypeptide structure of MBL includes a cysteine-rich N-terminal domain, a collagen-like region, a neck region and a C-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (3, 4). The CRD has been shown to bind mannose, mannan, fucose and N-acetylglucosamine (4). The cluster of CRDs rendered by oligomerization is thought to be suitable for binding polymeric sugars on microbes (5). Indeed, MBL can selectively recognize sugars presented on pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, yeast and leishmania via the CRD (6). In addition, several lines of evidence suggest that MBL can inhibit influenza A virus infection independent of complement activation (7). Other groups showed that MBL can interfere with the viral attachment to host cells, thus affecting viral spread and release (8\u201310).",

These two forms of rodent MBL bear 50% homology, displaying distinct but overlapping ligand-binding specificity (13). Both MBLs are mainly synthesized by hepatocytes and presented in liver and serum (13). However, extrahepatic expression of MBL was reported in various tissues. Indeed, non-hepatic mouse MBL-C (mMBL-C) expression is highest in the small intestine (14). It is known that intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) can produce cytokines and chemokines that are crucial for the recruitment and activation of immune cells (15, 16). Taken together, these findings indicate that mMBL-C expressed by IECs may contribute to the host defense against intestinal microorganisms.",

Furthermore, it has been shown that MBL is capable of blocking interaction of HIV with dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin expressed on dendritic cells, thereby inhibiting the virus transmission (31). In the present study, we have found that mMBL-C can directly bind to S. flexneri 2ain vitro, the antibody specific for mMBL-C-CRD is able to interfere the interaction, and mMBL-C can block the adhesion of S. flexneri 2a to intestinal tissues in vitro.",

More importantly, use of the antibody in vivo could abolish host defense against S. flexneri 2a, as indicated by more damages in IECs, increased the number of invaded bacteria and induced the higher expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1. Based on our data, we postulate that MBL may directly inhibit the interaction of microorganism with target cells through its CRD. Supporting evidence also came from the studies of gastrointestinal mucins, which has been shown to compete with underlying epithelium for binding to pathogens, resulting in reduced attachment of pathogens to the mucosal IECs for colonization (32, 33). Therefore, it appears that the mechanism of competitive inhibition has been commonly used by the host to protect against invasion of pathogenic microorganisms.",

Although infected mice did not show any gross signs of illness, mesenteric lymph nodes and pathologic changes during various sections of the intestinal tract indicated an establishment of chronic infection. Under most circumstances, the lack of MBL does not predispose the immunocompetent host to bacterial infection. It was in the setting of immune insufficiency that low levels of MBL produced by haplotypes were associated with enhanced susceptibility to infection, as was observed in the setting of cancer chemotherapy (36). Upon antibody blocking in vivo, we observed a significant increase in the number of S. flexneri 2a in intestinal tissues following infections, as compared with control animals treated with either saline or normal rabbit IgG. In addition, the expression of a pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 was found to be elevated in intestinal mucosa. Considering that S. flexneri 2a could not stimulate the TNF-\u03b1 expression from IECs in vitro, we suppose that this cytokine may be secreted by the infiltrated inflammatory cells.",
