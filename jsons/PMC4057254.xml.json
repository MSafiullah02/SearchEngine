Since sPLA2 is responsible for surfactant catabolism, its role is even more important in this context. In fact, surfactant replacement therapy has been tried, but it is not always beneficial in all infants [9]. This may be due to the inactivation by sPLA2, that creates a vicious cycle reducing surfactant efficiency [10]. Interestingly, several sPLA2 inhibitors carrying various specificities for sPLA2 subtypes, are now becoming available [11]. In a preliminary study on ARDS infants (conducted in 2007-2008), high levels of sPLA2 and significant correlations with oxygenation impairment and clinical severity have been found [12]. Thus, targeting sPLA2 could be an intriguing strategy for ARDS, although a proof of concept of its clinical importance is still lacking.",

Servo-I ventilators (Maquet, Solna, Sweden) and cuffed endotracheal tubes were used to ventilate both cases and controls. ARDS patients were ventilated using pressure-controlled time-cycled modality, targeted at a tidal volume (VT) of 6 mL/kg. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was set between 6 and 15 cmH2O and FiO2 at the minimum level to obtain an arterial oxygen saturation (SatO2) of 90-95%. PaCO2 values causing pH >7.30 were allowed. Rescue high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) was started according to our formal protocol [15]: in detail, HFOV is promptly instituted when a plateau pressure \u226428 cmH2O did not allow to reach the desired VT or when it was not possible to keep SatO2 >90%, with a FiO2 \u22640.6. Apnoeic sedation was provided with remifentanil (0.1-0.2 \u03b3/Kg/min) and midazolam (1-2 \u03b3/Kg/min). After the acute phase, ARDS patients were switched to pressure support ventilation when they had no hemodynamic or temperature instability and fulfilled the following criteria: mean airway pressure (P\u0101w) \u226415 cmH2O, FiO2 \u22640.5 with a SatO2 constantly >90% and no desaturation >5%, while suctioning. Pressure support was targeted to obtain VT of 6 mL/kg and stepped down as long as the ARDS patient was improving. PEEP during pressure support was set between 5 and 8 cmH2O; flow trigger was set at the highest possible sensitivity without auto-cycling; cycling-off was set at the 50% of the peak inspiratory flow. ARDS patients were extubated to continuous positive airway pressure at the same level of PEEP (5-8 cmH2O). Extubation took place when they fulfil the following criteria: (1) SatO2 \u226595% on PEEP \u22645 cm H2O and FiO2 \u226450%; (2) minimal VT = 5 mL/kg; and (3) respiratory rate appropriate for the age [16].

Since this is a part of our routine protocol for microbiological surveillance, no procedure was done solely for the study purposes. Lavage was performed as already described [12] and following advices of the European Respiratory Society Pediatric Task Force [17]. In detail, broncho-alveolar lavage was performed by instillation of two sequential aliquots of 1 mL/kg (up to a maximum of 5 mL) 0.9% NaCl warmed at 37\u00b0C, into the endotracheal tube, followed by three respiratory cycles. A straight, snub-nosed, end-hole suction catheter was gently advanced into the endotracheal tube, while continuing ventilation through a Y-connector. When resistance was met, suctioning with 50 mmHg of negative pressure was applied. The procedure was repeated with the infant's head turned 90\u00b0 to the left and then to the right in order to virtually ensure sampling from the right and the left lung, respectively. The first collected fluid, reflecting tracheo-bronchial milieu, was sent for microbiological culture. The second aliquot consisted on average of 1.8 \u00b1 0.5 mL (about 40% of the instilled volume) and was diluted with 0.9% saline up to 2 mL and centrifuged (3,000 rpm; 4\u00b0C; 10').

After gentle shacking of 4 h in blocking solution (5% non-fat dry milk, PBS, and 0.5% Tween 20), blots were first incubated with anti-sPLA2-IB (polyclonal), -V (monoclonal), or -X (polyclonal) antibodies (Santa-Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Anti-sPLA2-IIA (monoclonal) antibody (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) was also used. All these antibodies were specific for human phospholipases and were incubated in blocking solution (1:200; 2 h). Every excess of primary antibody was then removed twice using wash solution for 10' and immune-reactive bands were subsequently incubated with goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG-HRP secondary antibodies (1:2,000) in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were washed four times for 10' (each time) in PBS and 0.05% Tween 20 solution and blotted proteins were revealed using Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol with maximum exposure time of 1'.",

Following the introduction of surfactant, changes in surface tension were monitored for 5 min (initial adsorption) from the change in the bubble shape [28]. The chamber was then sealed and the bubble was quickly (1s) expanded to 0.15 cm3, to record post-expansion adsorption during 5 min. Then quasi-static cycles started, where the bubble size was first reduced and then enlarged in a stepwise fashion. There was 1' delay between the four quasi-static cycles and the following dynamic cycles. During dynamic cycles the bubble was continuously compressed and expanded at a rate of 20 cycles/min.",

As previously reported [12], a significant correlation exists between TNF\u03b1 and sPLA2, confirming the role of TNF\u03b1 as enhancer of sPLA2 expression. [10] This leads to relevant consequences in terms of biochemical and biophysical effects. Total amount of phospholipids is also reduced in BALF of ARDS patients, although a qualitative alteration of the phosphilipid pool is also likely to occur (see below). Adult ARDS patients have lower levels of SP-A [21] and this protein is known to directly inhibit sPLA2-IIA [32,33]. SP-A binds sPLA2 through a direct protein-protein interaction, thus it has been expressed as a ratio [32,33]. Our data seem to suggest that SP-A could be relatively lacking and that the interaction between sPLA2 and SP-A could play a role also in pediatric ARDS patients. However, the difference in sPLA2/SP-A ratio between cases and controls is not statistically significant, possibly due to our small population size: claryfing the role of SP-A is worth to be done with a specific study. In fact, commercially available surfactants do not have SP-A and this may account for the variable efficacy of surfactant replacement therapy. [9]",

            "text": "sPLA2-IIA, -V, and -X are highly expressed in nearly all infants and secreted into the alveoli. These subtypes are also detected, although in lower amount, in some controls and this is consistent with animal data showing their expression in total lung extracts, as sPLA2-IIA is produced from various circulating cells [2] and sPLA2-V and -X from airway epithelial cells [34]. Presence of some amount of sPLA2 isotypes may be due to their physiologic roles as anti-infective molecules [2] or to a certain degree of inflammation. In fact, our controls were intubated infants and some ventilation-induced inflammation is unavoidable. While the importance of sPLA2-IIA had been already highlighted in ARDS [5,6], sPLA2-V and -X were only suspected to play a role, given the animal data available so far. These studies showed that sPLA2-V expression in mice lung is associated with surfactant hydrolysis [35] and gene targeted mice lacking sPLA2-V presented a milder form of acute lung injury with lower inflammation [36]. Similarly, sPLA2-X can efficiently hydrolyse surfactant phospholipids in vitro and this activity is also inhibited by SP-A [2,33]. Our findings in human infants with ARDS seem to confirm a role for sPLA2-V and -X. A propeptide of sPLA2-IB had been detected in serum of adult ARDS patients but not in controls [37]: this is consistent with our data showing presence of sPLA2-IB in 75% of patients. Given the widespread tissue distribution of sPLA2-IB [1,2], it is possible that this subtype arrives to the lung after production elsewhere or from circulating inflammatory cells reaching the lung. Alternatively, sPLA2-IB may be locally triggered by sPLA2-IIA, since a specific cross-talk exists between the two subtypes [38]. These data are relevant, as many sPLA2 inhibitors are now under advanced investigation and carry different inhibitory potency against the four described subtypes [11].",

Since CBS was carried out at the same phospholipid concentration, it is the quality of surfactant that seems to be affected in ARDS. This qualitative alteration has been already described in adult ARDS patients [39] and may be related to the activity of the various sPLA2 subclasses secreted into the alveoli.

This is confirmed by our findings, as minimal surface tension is significantly correlated to Crs and to gas exchange impairment. The latter two have been linked with sPLA2 in animal studies and in adults with ARDS [3-6]. Interestingly, not only surface tension, but also FFA, correlate with these physiopathologic variables. It has been demonstrated that the two products of sPLA2 reaction, lysophospholipids and FFA, are potent inhibitors of surfactant biophysical activity [42]. Conversely, FFA are precursors of various proinflammatory mediators: thus, the effect on lung compliance and oxygenation may be not only due to the direct lypolitic activity of sPLA2 on surfactant phospholipids, but also to lysophospholipids and FFA inhibiting the remaining surfactant and to the additional contribution of other FFA-derived inflammatory molecules. Consistently, the Murray's lung injury score, that globally describe the clinical severity (taking into accout Crs, oxygenation deficit, and other variables), also correlates with both surface tension and FFA. We must admit that correlations shown in Table 2 are statistically significant but lower than others, thus a strong and direct relationship cannot be assumed just from these findings. Given the biological background, a link is likely to exist between the analyzed variables, but it is also possible that other factors are involved in these relationships influencing the results [40,41].",

It is also possible that mechanical ventilation might induce an inhibitory effect, both in controls and in ARDS patients, affecting the minimal tension reached by the relatively diluted concentrations of surfactant tested here. Finally, it is also conceivable that differences in minimal tensions between controls and ARDS patients could be maximized if tested at higher surfactant concentrations. Unfortunately, the limited sample volume available from infants prevented the assay at concentrations >10 mg/mL. Anyway, all samples were assessed at equivalent phospholipid concentrations, indicating that the differences found between controls and ARDS patients are indicative of an actual alteration of surfactant function.",

            "text": "Raised sPLA2 activity, through the increment in inflammation and surface tension that impairs lung mechanics and oxygenation, might finally have relevant clinical consequences. In fact, as secondary study aim, we found sPLA2 activity to be significantly correlated with PICU stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and oxygen therapy. Our population mortality is consistent with other reports [7]. Since pediatric ARDS has a relatively low incidence and mortality, this latter is not a feasible clinical endpoint, while shorter respiratory support is an accepted alternative outcome resulting from decreasing inflammation [7]. Similarly, PICU stay is an alternative, as it may impact on mortality through the increased risk of nosocomial infections and on the general burden of care. sPLA2 activity is also correlated with the PRISM-III24 and its predicted mortality. Similar correlation with predicted mortality was described in adults using a different score commonly applied in adult critical care [6]. About 30% to 40% of PICUs worldwide are using HFOV as rescue method for respiratory support in children unresponding to conventional ventilation [7] and since we have a strict protocol for rescue HFOV, we were able to analyze this as a secondary additional outcome. Consistently with the other findings, babies needing HFOV turned out to have higher sPLA2 levels. Rescue HFOV may use higher P\u0101w to recruit alveoli in more stiff and collapsed lungs; thus, it seems logical that patients with higher sPLA2 activity have more diseased lungs and require such technique to be ventilated.",
