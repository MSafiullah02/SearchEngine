In the cytoplasm, RNA is similarly structured, organized, and regulated by interactions with membranes, the cytoskeleton, different organelles, and by a host of aggregation-prone RNA-binding proteins. Localized gradients of specific mRNA transcripts regulate the organization and the timing of gene expression that occurs during development. Within individual somatic and germ cells, discrete mRNA granules are transiently assembled as mRNA transcripts move into and out of polysomes. The recruitment, retention, and removal of specific transcripts into and out of RNA granules is orchestrated by numerous mRNA binding proteins, which regulate the fate of specific transcripts.",

            "text": "Consequently, biochemical analysis of protein translation in cell lysates cannot completely recapitulate the translational regulatory pathways that occur in live cells. Critical components of the \u201ccell biology\u201d of protein translation are mRNP granules known as processing bodies (PBs) and stress granules (SGs). These transient cytoplasmic \u201cstructures\u201d are actively assembled from untranslated mRNA by a host of RNA-binding proteins, which determine whether specific transcripts will be reinitiated, degraded, or stored. The mRNA within PBs and SGs is in a dynamic equilibrium with polysomes, and this equilibrium is shifted by changes in environmental conditions. Specific RNA-binding proteins promote the translation of some transcripts and inhibit the translation of others; silenced transcripts are assembled into SGs or PBs, whereas preferential translation occurs outside these bodies. In stressed cells, the selective translational repression of \u201chousekeeping\u201d genes conserves anabolic energy for the repair of stress-induced molecular damage. At the same time, enhanced translation of repair enzymes directly repairs this damage while promoting an adaptive response to the altered conditions. Thus, shifting specific transcripts between polysomes and RNA granules tailors translation to changes in environmental conditions.",

Drugs that arrest translational elongation and thereby stabilize polysomes promote the disassembly of SGs and PBs, whereas drugs that enhance polysome disassembly promote (but are not sufficient to cause) SG/PB assembly. Numerous photobleaching studies indicate that the mRNPs that comprise SGs and PBs are in very rapid flux (seconds), although SGs and PBs persist for minutes to hours. A useful analogy holds that mRNPs are to SG/PBs as water is to a river; rapidly moving water creates a large stable river, but the water is always in flux. Similarly, moving streams of mRNPs create SGs and PBs. When examining the functional properties of SG/PBs, it is useful to consider that the functional properties of rivers (e.g., erosion, navigation, and hydroelectric power) are different from those of water alone. Similarly, the discrete domains (SGs and PBs) created from relocalized mRNPs alter the trafficking of other proteins and have important secondary effects (alternative splicing, transcription, nucleocytoplasmic transport) on overall cell metabolism.",

Remarkably, the normally nuclear RNA-binding protein TIA-1 (T-cell internal antigen 1) rapidly colocalizes in these cytoplasmic granules, and a truncation mutant of TIA-1 blocks their formation. As similar RNA-containing \u201cheat-shock granules\u201d had been described in plant cells,2 it seemed likely that mammalian SGs were related to plant \u201cheat-shock granules.\u201d Only recently3 was it shown that RNA-containing SGs and plant heat-shock granules are in fact distinct: plant heat-shock granules do not contain mRNA as originally reported, although plant cells do indeed form bona fide SGs and PBs in addition to heat-shock granules. Thus in hindsight, and despite the frequent use of the phrase \u201cit has long been known\u201d to describe RNA-containing SGs, in actual fact these SGs were first described only a decade ago.",

Importantly, preassembled SGs are forcibly disassembled by emetine even in the continued presence of phospho-eIF2\u03b1 suggesting that they do not represent static storage depots of mRNPs but instead contain mRNPs in equilibrium with polysomes. Direct measurements using FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching) confirmed that both TIA-1 and PABP rapidly shuttle into and out of SGs, with TIA-1 moving more rapidly than PABP. The half-lives revealed by FRAP were on the order of 2\u201310 s, in marked contrast with the much slower kinetics of SG assembly (15\u201330 min). The first movies of SG assembly and disassembly revealed that SGs form synchronously throughout the cell and progressively fuse to become larger and fewer. As cells recover from stress, the large \u201cmature\u201d SGs disassemble synchronously within individual cells, in a time frame of 4\u20136 min. These data established that SGs are dynamic microdomains into which PABP and TIA-1 rapidly shuttle, and which are in equilibrium with polysomes. PABP is a translational enhancer, and TIA-1 is a translational silencer,5 hence we proposed that SGs constitute dynamic mRNA triage domains, in which mRNA processing, sorting, and remodeling events regulate the expression of specific transcripts.6, 7\n",

            "text": "A more detailed in situ analysis of SGs8 revealed that they contain small but not large ribosomal subunits, and the initiation factors eIF3, eIF4E, and eIF4G. However, eIF5 and eIF2 are not prominent components of SGs, despite the fact that phospho-eIF2\u03b1 drives SG assembly. Contemporary models of translation initiation suggested that eIF5 normally links eIF2/GTP/tRNAMeti to eIF3 and the small ribosomal subunit to form the 43S complex, which is thought to form prior to the recruitment of eIF4F, PABP, and the mRNA to form the 48S complex. As SGs contain most components of the 48S complex but lack eIF5 and eIF2, SGs appear to contain aggregates of aberrant 48S complexes, lacking eIF5/eIF2/GTP/tRNAMeti but containing instead the TIA proteins. In sucrose gradients, these TIA-1-containing complexes migrate with small mRNPs near the top of the gradient rather than with polysomes. Interestingly, phospho-eIF2\u03b1 is detected in late SGs, but not newly formed ones, supporting a model in which lack of ternary complexes drives SG formation via the formation of aberrant 48S complexes. Another report9 partly confirmed these results, but differed in finding eIF2\u03b1 and eIF2B in arsenite-induced SGs: whether this reflects differences between antibodies or cell lines remains unresolved. This study showed for the first time that thapsigargin, a specific activator of PERK, induces SGs that are prevented by a kinase-dead form of PERK. Together, these studies established that SG formation is a result of stalled initiation and confirmed a central role for phospho-eIF2\u03b1 in their assembly.",

Although originally described as an endonuclease, no such activity has been demonstrated in vivo, so the functional consequences of G3BP-nucleated SGs are unknown. However, the AU-rich mRNA decay factor tristetraprolin (TTP) similarly nucleates SGs which are prevented by its phosphorylation and interactions with 14-3-3 proteins,12 providing the first example of a protein that moves to SGs under some conditions but not others. A flood of proteins too numerous to cite individually were subsequently identified as SG-associated (summarized in Table I\n). Some of these are considered below.",

Pull-down studies established that the molecular target of pateamine A is eIF4A,13 the DEAD-box helicase necessary for cap-dependent translation requiring 48S scanning. Toe-printing studies and polysome profiles on in vitro translated material revealed that pateamine A inactivates scanning, apparently by stabilizing interactions between eIF4A and eIF4B. This study added eIF4A and eIF4B to the growing list of initiation factors found in SGs. A similar compound named hippuristanol, found in the coral Isis hippuris, also blocks eIF4A scanning activity by preventing its binding to mRNA.14 Remarkably, both pateamine A and hippuristanol induce SGs in mutant eIF2\u03b1-S51A MEFs, which contain only a non-phosphorylatable form of eIF2\u03b1,15, 16 and the SGs induced by these drugs contain eIF2 and eIF5. These drugs have been widely used in subsequent studies to determine whether a given protein is recruited to SGs or not, and as such have been invaluable tools. However, these drugs circumvent the physiological stress response that activates one or some of the multiple kinases that target eIF2\u03b1 (and perhaps other proteins: PKR targets RNA helicase A; Ref. 17) as well as other kinase cascades. Moreover, eIF4A is present in multiple isoforms and has other functions (e.g., NMD), and these drugs have other targets in addition to eIF4A (e.g., pateamine A binds unrip; Ref. 13).",

In most cases, SG assembly results from stress-induced phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, a component of the eIF2/GTP/tRNAMeti ternary complex that directs tRNAi\nMet to the 40S ribosomal subunit. Phospho-eIF2\u03b1 is a competitive inhibitor of eIF2B, a GDP-GTP exchange factor that charges the eIF2/GTP/tRNAMeti ternary complex. Thus, phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 effectively depletes active ternary complex resulting in translational repression. This translation control pathway is initiated by a family of eIF2\u03b1 kinases that are activated by different types of environmental stress. Protein kinase R (PKR) senses heat, UV irradiation, and viral infection.24, 25 PERK/PEK (PKR-like ER kinase) senses endoplasmic reticular stress accompanying excess production of secretory proteins; GCN2 (General Control non-derepressible 2) senses nutrient stress (e.g., amino acid starvation); HRI (Heme-regulated inhibitor) senses heme levels in erythroid progenitor cells to balance the synthesis of globin and heme, as well as arsenite-induced oxidative stress. Lack of ternary complex triggers SG assembly by stalling initiation while allowing elongation to proceed normally, resulting in polysome disassembly, necessary but not sufficient for both SG and PB assembly. Notably, PB formation is independent of phospho-eIF2\u03b1, although it still requires free mRNPs.",

Whereas mRNAs encoding \u201chousekeeping\u201d transcripts are concentrated at SGs, mRNAs encoding molecular chaperones that refold stress-denatured proteins (HSP70) or alter the conformation of signaling proteins (HSP90) are selectively excluded from SGs. This has been proposed to account, in part, for the ability of certain transcripts to be selectively translated during stress. Although the mechanism by which HSP70 transcripts are excluded from SGs is not known, it is likely that mRNAs transcribed during stress acquire or lack distinct protein \u201cmarks\u201d that determine their functional fate in the cytoplasm. HSP70 transcripts are unusual in several ways: they lack introns, and thereby lack proteins deposited at splicing junctions, one of which (MLN51) is selectively recruited to SGs26\u2014whether this allows a selective recruitment of spliced mRNAs into SGs remains to be determined. In addition, HSP70 mRNA possesses a long structured 5\u2032-untranslated region (5\u2032-UTR) that allows translation initiation to occur via a shunting mechanism,27 which would preclude reliance on eIF4A, whose inactivation causes SG assembly.15, 16 As certain viral 5\u2032-UTRs exempt transcripts from SG recruitment and translational silencing,28 the HSP70 5\u2032-UTR may function similarly. A number of viral mRNAs elude or suppress SG assembly by various mechanisms.",

Two nuclear structures linked to mRNP maturation and processing, Cajal bodies and Gems, are coincident in many but not all cell types, so there is precedent for this duality.36 This spatial confluence is ascribed to coupled mRNA processing or remodeling steps that tether these structures together. Factors regulating PB/GWB fusion have not been identified, although there are reports of PB heterogeneity. Interactions between SGs and PBs are more clearly documented.35, 37 Some conditions (arsenite, overexpression of TTP or CPEB) similarly cause SGs and PBs to juxtapose and fuse, whereas under other conditions they are largely independent.

A single species of mRNA can be assembled into a SG or a PB, even within the same cell.35 While the factors that influence sorting into distinct types of granules are not well understood, there is evidence that the mode of polysome disassembly affects the type of RNA granule that is assembled, leading to the following model.

In neurons that are particularly susceptible to ischemic injury (e.g., hippocampal cornu ammonis 1; CA1), translational arrest is prolonged and translational reprogramming that allows the preferential translation of repair proteins (e.g., heat-shock proteins) is impaired.

            "text": "SG and PB formation is a regulated consequence of translational arrest, but there appears to be many levels to the story. Monitoring SG formation may be of diagnostic use in assessing viral infection or hypoxia, as it affords us a window on the translational status of individual cells within tissues. However, while SGs and PBs are primarily sites of remodeling, packaging, and sorting of mRNA, their assembly is linked to other cellular processes and pathways via a growing number of specific proteins. SGs secondarily recruit proteins involved in splicing, transcription, and signaling as part of an adaptive process. Defining the specific molecules that link SG formation to other pathways, and selectively targeting them may be of therapeutic value. The impact of PB/GWB formation on other pathways is presently less clear, but the ongoing river of data will doubtlessly flush out new ideas as these exciting young fields mature.",

Stalled initiation allows elongating ribosomes to leave polysomes, resulting in stalled 48S mRNPs which recruit available cytoplasmic RNA-binding proteins (blue region), many of which would normally shuttle into the nucleus (pink area). Locally high concentrations of mRNPs promote aggregation into small complexes, which progressively fuse into larger aggregates, assisted by microtubule-dependent motors. Sorting ensues as the higher affinity interactions prevail, and as other signaling molecules are recruited. Subsets of mRNPs may be removed from the SGs pending phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding and shunted to PBs for decay (e.g., TTP). Other mRNPs may be exported for other fates.",
