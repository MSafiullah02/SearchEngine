            "text": "Immune deficient mice in which human cells survive and function are a valuable tool for the in vivo study of human immune function and human diseases including auto-immune disorders, lymphoma and infectious diseases (Murphy et al., 1996). In studies of HIV pathogenesis and therapy, the two most commonly used systems are the SCID-hu model and the huPBL-SCID model (McCune et al., 1988, Mosier et al., 1988, Borkow, 2005). In the latter model, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are commonly injected into the peritoneum of the severely immune deficient mice resulting in a human cell graft in which T cells predominate. We described a variant huPBL NOD/SCID model, in which PBMC were transferred into the spleen instead of into the peritoneum (Depraetere et al., 2001). In brief, this intraspleen (i.s.) transfer results in a massive non-specific, T cell-dependent expansion of B cells that actively secrete immunoglobulins in the blood of the mice. The antigen specificities of the mouse sera reflect the specificities found in the human B cell donor, elicited by infections or immunizations. Six to ten days post injection, human B cells are transiently predominant in the mouse spleen from where they can be easily recovered for subsequent immortalization procedures and generation of human monoclonal antibodies. So far we have successfully generated human monoclonal antibodies against the hepatitis B surface and core antigens (Cao et al., 2001, Vanlandschoot et al., 2002), hepatitis C NS3A and NS4B1 (Depraetere et al., 2001) and tetanus toxoid (unpublished results). We envisage that the i.s. huPBL NOD/SCID model may be used to isolate therapeutic human antibodies and to analyse the antibody repertoire in immune and vaccinated individuals to help in the design of vaccines against viruses like HCV and HIV (analytic vaccinology).",

            "text": "In the present study we assessed whether i.s. transfer of PBMC from HIV-1 infected patients would result in a good B cell expansion, circulation of HIV-specific antibodies and allow for the generation of monoclonal HIV-specific antibodies. Success is not necessarily guaranteed since HIV infection affects both number and function of T and B lymphocytes. CD4 + T lymphocytes drive the expansion of B cells after i.s. transfer of PBMC in mice (Depraetere et al., 2001). However, HIV infection is known to cause a rapid depletion of human CD4 T cells in SCID mice (Mosier et al., 1991). B cell behaviour is altered as represented by a paradoxical polyclonal activation of B cells (Lane et al., 1983), resulting in an increased frequency of circulating antibody secreting cells and hypergamma-globulinemia (Yarchoan et al., 1986, Martinez-Maza et al., 1987, Amadori et al., 1988, Amadori et al., 1989, Shirai et al., 1992). During untreated and HAART-treated chronic HIV infection, memory B cells gradually disappear from the circulation (De Milito et al., 2001, Fondere et al., 2003, Chong et al., 2004, Titanji et al., 2006). A deregulated expression of several surface molecules (Indraccolo et al., 1993, Samuelsson et al., 1997, Moir et al., 2001, Moir et al., 2004) and a decreased response to B cell activators in vivo and in vitro have been described (Lane et al., 1983, Conge et al., 1998).",

The activated human B cells were recovered from the mouse spleen one week after injection. Previous experiments showed that at that time, human B cells are predominantly present in the spleen. The human B cells in experiment I were fused with the heteromyeloma cell line and then extensively diluted before seeding the wells at a frequency of 100 B cells per well (40 \u00d7 96-well). After 21 days, clusters of viable cells were detected in 284 of 3840 seeded wells (7%). Although IgG secretion was detected in all of them, HIV-specific antibodies were only found in one. The cells were successfully subcloned until monoclonality (anti-p24) was obtained. In a second experiment (II), seeding of B cells was done at varying numbers: 10 \u00d7 96 wells were seeded at 100 B cells per well, 7 \u00d7 96-well at 1000 B cells per well, 5 \u00d7 48-well at 10,000 B cells per well and 2 \u00d7 6-well at 100,000 B cells per well. In the wells seeded at the highest densities (100,000 and 10,000 B cells per well), clusters of immortalized B cells were obtained in all of them (100%). HIV-specific antibodies were present in 1 of 12 (8%) and in 32 of 240 (13%), respectively. However, this anti-HIV positivity decreased rapidly and all limited dilution steps were unsuccessful. In the wells seeded at the lowest concentrations (1000 to 100 B cells per well), viable cell clusters were present in 55% and 4% of wells respectively and anti-HIV antibodies in 47 of 372 (13%) and 2 of 38 (5%) wells, respectively. Again, a striking loss of anti-HIV positivity was observed. Out of the wells seeded at 1,000 B cells per well, one stable hybridoma cell line producing anti-p24 could be generated.",

The functionality of the engrafted human B cells was demonstrated by an early and vigorous antibody response in the blood of the mice. The transfer of PBMC from untreated HIV-infected patients with detectable viremia in optimally conditioned NOD/SCID mice resulted in replication of endogenous virus. In the mice reconstituted with PBMC from patients having undetectable viral load, replication often remained below detection (< 3.60 log geq/ml). We assume that the proviral load in the transferred PBMC was strongly related to the viral load in the plasma of the patients (Andreoni et al., 2000, Ngo-Giang-Huong et al., 2001).",

In the latter group the antibody response was mainly directed against proteins encoded by the gag gene (p24 and p17) while the response of PBMC from the viremic subjects was mainly directed to the viral envelope (gp120 and gp41). Antibodies against env and gag antigens are mounted during an HIV infection but differ in the extent to which they are sustained throughout the course of an HIV infection. While anti-env is usually present at high titres even in individuals who progress to disease, the anti-gag response is lost during disease progression (Schmidt et al., 1989, Cheingsong-Popov et al., 1991, Zwart et al., 1994, Hogervorst et al., 1995, Strathdee et al., 1995, Binley et al., 1997). This decline in anti-gag is thought to be a surrogate marker for the loss in T cell help (Binley et al., 1997, Trkola et al., 2004). Therefore, it is most likely that the gag-directed antibodies in the untreated naturally controlling patients reflect good functional T cell help.",

This is most likely a result of compartmentalization. In the mouse model, antibody production is derived from the memory B cells present in the circulation of HIV-infected subjects. In contrast, the HIV-specific antibodies detected in human plasma are predominantly derived from plasma cells in the bone marrow and antibody producing cells in the lymph nodes (Morris et al., 1998). These antibodies have also been secreted over an extended period of time.",

            "text": "In order to isolate HIV-specific monoclonal antibodies using the i.s. huPBL NOD/SCID model, it is clear that PBMC from untreated patients need to be used because only such patients have HIV-specific memory B cells in their peripheral blood. We were able to generate large numbers of IgG producing hybridoma cells, but the isolation of monoclonal hybridoma cell lines by limited dilutions was more difficult. There are several possible explanations for this low success rate. First of all, untreated HIV patients have a reduced number of memory B cells. Secondly, it has been estimated that in untreated patients about 10\u2212 2 to 10\u2212 3 of the memory B cells are HIV-specific (Fondere et al., 2004). We previously showed that 7 days after injection of 2 \u00d7 107 PBMC, \u223c 8 \u00d7 106 human B cells are present in the spleen (Depraetere et al., 2001). This would suggest that only 8000\u201380,000 HIV-specific B cells are available for immortalization. Finally, we noticed that the immortalized B cells grew slowly and anti-HIV production was easily lost. Clearly, B cell function and response is deregulated by HIV infection and apparently HIV also affects the immortalized B cells. The slow growth of fused B cells and the loss of HIV-specific antibody production has also been observed by other authors (Buchacher et al, 1994). It was hypothesized that genomic instability of the cells within the first weeks after immortalization was responsible for this problem. Nevertheless, we were able to isolate two stable human monoclonal cell lines, that produce an antibody against the gag protein p24. Human monoclonal antibodies with this specificity are mainly used for diagnostic purposes. So far, human monoclonal antibodies against HIV have been produced by immortalizing B cells with EBV (Gorny et al., 1989) or by fusing B cells with appropriate myeloma cells (Buchacher et al., 1994). These methods have however a very low efficiency and therefore, alternative strategies are to be developed. In our mouse model, PBMC are injected directly into the spleen. This results in a strong polyclonal activation and a striking expansion of B cells from the memory B cells present in the PBMC mix. Recently, such memory B cells have been used for the successful generation of human monoclonal antibodies against the SARS coronavirus by culturing them in the presence of EBV and suitable growth factors (Traggiai et al., 2004). Whether this approach is successful for the generation of human monoclonal antibodies against HIV remains to be determined.",

Intrasplenic transfer might also be used to increase the number of HIV-specific memory B cells, before a single-chain phage display library is constructed. The i.s. huPBL NOD/SCID model may therefore be helpful to identify and isolate monoclonal antibodies that bind broadly neutralizing, enhancing and non-neutralizing epitopes on HIV.
