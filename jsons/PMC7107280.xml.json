SDP is a complex mixture of functional proteins and the beneficial effects observed in pigs fed SDP are related to modulating the inflammatory response both locally in the intestine and systemically (Moret\u00f3 and P\u00e9rez-Bosque, 2009) through the interconnection of the common mucosal immune system (Kiyono and Fukuyama, 2004). Several pathogenic viruses that were intentionally injected into feed ingredients may survive in a simulated transboundary transport for more than 30 days (Dee et al., 2015, 2018). Thus, there is increased interest in identifying strategies that may be used to mitigate the risk of potential disease transmission from feed or feed ingredients to pigs.",

The reduction of IgG may be due to formaldehyde binding the protein or affecting functionality thus preventing detection by the analytical method. SDP is a complex mixture of many proteins and IgG is one of the best-known plasma proteins to have functional properties. However, other plasma proteins may also be affected by formaldehyde binding, but only IgG was measured in this study. Analysis of ingredients provides a measure of quality based on chemical characteristics of the ingredient; however, inclusion of the ingredient in complete diets allows for determining effects of treatment on pig growth performance. Although feeding formaldehyde-treated SDP incorporated into diets resulted in greater pig growth performance compared with that of pigs fed the control diet, pig growth performance was reduced for treated SDP compared with pigs consuming untreated SDP. Results of the in-vitro part of experiment 1 and the animal growth performance study indicate that direct application of formaldehyde on SDP reduced the beneficial effects commonly observed if SDP is used in weanling pig diets (Torrallardona, 2010; Pujols et al., 2016). Although formaldehyde may denature proteins (Sotelo et al., 1995), to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which effects on pig growth performance of direct application of formaldehyde to SDP have been reported. The reduced growth and feed intake of pigs fed diets containing formaldehyde-treated SDP compared with pigs fed diets containing untreated SDP indicate that the reduction in IgG concentration that was observed in the in vitro study and possibly denaturing of protein have negative impacts on pig growth performance. However, the growth performance of pigs fed diets containing the formaldehyde-treated SDP was greater than that of pigs fed the control diet indicating that formaldehyde did not eliminate the positive responses to SDP.",

Thus, it appears that Sal CURB treatment of diets does not negatively affect pig growth performance, and results of experiment 2 agree with previous data.
