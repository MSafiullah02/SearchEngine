Further sequencing studies revealed that it is a new type of Paramyxovirus and is about 20% different from HeV in nucleotide homology. [7] [8] [9] 2 | NIPAH VIRUS Nipah virus is an enveloped virus, pleomorphic in shape (40-1900 nm) having single-stranded negative-sense RNA genome. 3, 10 Under electron microscope, NiV has similar morphological structure pattern as that of other members of Paramyxoviridae. NiV is placed along with HeV in the genus Henipavirus of family Paramyxoviridae as NiV showed 68% to 92% and 40% to 67% homology with HeV in protein-coded regions and non-translated regions, respectively. 3,7-10 Like other Paramyxoviruses, NiV also has six genes which encode for fusion protein (F), glycoprotein (G), matrix protein (M), nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), and polymerase protein (L). Phosphoprotein (P) gene encodes various important accessory proteins known as C, V, and W. 3, 11, 12 The C protein plays a very important role in regulation of viral RNA synthesis and virulence factor. V and W proteins are crucial for virulence, and these proteins act by inhibiting the activation of an interferon-inducible promoter. 11, 12 Strain variations have been observed between human NiV isolates collected from the outbreaks in Malaysia, India, and Bangladesh. Similarly, NiV virus isolates from bats samples which were collected from different geographical area also displayed genomic variation. [12] [13] [14] NiV is a newly emerging virus, and also high containment facility is required for NiV study; therefore, limited data is available on virus replication, transcription, translation, and other mechanisms. In Paramyxoviridae family, NiV are closer to HeV as compared with other family members. Antibodies against NiV also crossreact with HeV but not against other members of family. 15 In contrast to other paramyxoviruses, genomes of NiV and HeV are much longer, ie, 18.2 and 15.5 kb, respectively. The P genes of both viruses are longer than other members of family. 16 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 260, "end": 263, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 264, "end": 267, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 268, "end": 271, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 344, "end": 356, "text": "(40-1900 nm)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 407, "end": 409, "text": "3,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1028, "end": 1030, "text": "3,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1031, "end": 1034, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1272, "end": 1275, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1544, "end": 1548, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1549, "end": 1553, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1554, "end": 1558, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The epidemiology related to NiV has not been fully understood as Biosafety level-4 (BSL-4) laboratory facility is required for virus research.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "| EPIDEMIOLOGY OF NIPAH VIRUS"}, {"text": "The Pteropus fruit bat, which is also known as the flying fox (order Chiroptera and genus Pteropus) considered as the natural animal reservoirs for NiV. 4, 13 There are about 60 different species of these flying fox, which are found in Asia, China, Australia and some part of Africa as well as the Pacific Islands. 20 Experimentally, it is yet to be confirmed whether these flying foxes develop sub-clinical disease or not, after NiV infection to them. 21, 22 Sero-surveillance studies for NiV detection in flying foxes samples were conducted in Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand, and Bangladesh, where 9% to 25% bats were found positive for the NiV. 13, [23] [24] [25] The NiV were isolated from some flying fox urine samples collected from Malaysia and Cambodia. 13, 26 In Malaysian outbreak, flying foxes acted as natural host for NiV, and pigs acted as a mediator host to humans. Pigs had been infected by indirect contact with NiV infected flying foxes in the endemic regions. 27, 28 The outbreaks of NiV in human population have been documented from Malaysia, Singapore, Bangladesh, and India. NiV has also been isolated and identified in flying foxes in Malaysia, Singapore, Bangladesh, India, Cambodia, and Thailand. 29 Until June 2018, five countries (Malaysia, Singapore, Bangladesh, India, and Philippines) are affected due to NiV which was responsible for 643 laboratory confirmed patients and at least 380 (59%) human deaths (Table 1) . 29 In Cambodia and Thailand, NiV were found only in flying foxes and no NiV infected human case was reported. 13, 25 Direct contact with NiV infected pigs and their products were primarily responsible for the outbreak in Malaysia. 28 [26] [27] [28] Initially, all these outbreaks were considered due to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), which was generally prevalent in these area. 4, 29 In response to this, JEV vaccination and various steps for mosquito control were taken to manage these outbreaks but even after that the disease was expanding continuously. 29 The epidemiological data showed that causative agent for these outbreaks was different from JEV because majority of patients were adult as compared with children. Previously, JEV immunized persons were also infected with new agent, and during animal surveillance there were sick pigs with severe barking cough and many dying from the same disease. 4-8 A large number of infected individuals were adult males and were directly associated with pig farming. Pigs to human transmissions of NiV were observed in these outbreaks. Control steps like culling of pigs, avoid pig contact, and exchange of pig were taken in affected NiV areas and as a result the infection declined. [7] [8] [9] During these outbreaks in Malaysia, a total of 265 Nipah encephalitis patients were confirmed out of which 105 (39.6%) deaths were reported. 29 Although these outbreaks were comparatively small but mortality rates were very high led to the reason of panic in that area. 28, 29 Various steps including ban on pig transport, public education, national surveillance, and pig culling were taken to control NiV outbreak. Pig farming is one of top industries in Malaysia, and more than one million pigs were culled during NiV outbreaks, resulted in an economic loss between $350 and $400 million. 30 The NiV infection spread to Singapore due to import of infected pigs from infected area of Malaysia. In early March 1999, 11 pig farmers in Singapore were diagnosed NiV positive with one fatality. All those farmers were involved in the import of live pigs from NiV infected part of Malaysia and had close contact history with the infected pigs. 4, 8 Singapore government took immediate and effective actions against the NiV outbreak including culling of pigs, avoiding contact with NiV infected pigs and also banning of import of pigs from Malaysia. [4] [5] [6] 29 After these actions, outbreak was contained and last confirmed NiV case from Malaysia or Singapore was reported in May 1999. 5-8 These NiV outbreaks were very serious, and true numbers of infections may be uncertain due to large number of asymptomatic patients.
