Health indicators in the EMR are among the worst in the world.6 State fragility and conflict are among the biggest challenges to attainment of Sustainable Development Goal 3.7 Conflict is a global health security threat because affected countries are less able to prevent, detect, and respond to disease outbreaks. More than 70% of disease outbreaks worldwide occur in fragile and conflict-affected settings.8 Yemen has experienced the largest cholera outbreak in history.9 During the second half of 2019, there were six concurrent disease outbreaks in Sudan.10 Wild polio virus returned to Syria due to conflict,11 while Afghanistan and Pakistan are two of three countries where the virus remains endemic.12 The average International Health Regulations (IHR) core capacity score is much lower for the 12 conflict-affected countries than for the other countries in the region,6 placing them at greater risk of spread and public health consequences of the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other epidemic-prone diseases. WHO's global COVID-19 strategic preparedness and response plan13 therefore prioritises countries with weak health systems for technical and operational support from international partners.

Nowhere are these constraints more evident than in the currently worsening crisis of northwest Syria, where close to 1 million people have been displaced and more than 70 health facilities have ceased functioning since December, 2019.14 The growing disregard for international humanitarian law and the right to health is also deeply troubling. During 2018, WHO documented 388 attacks on health care worldwide from secondary sources; 276 (71%) occurred in the EMR.15 Humanitarian agencies have adopted various approaches to address these constraints, including investments in local partners, cross-border operations, deconfliction, remote programming, and scaled up advocacy and humanitarian diplomacy. Robust processes for duty of care of staff are essential. Local partners face the biggest risks; the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, for example, has lost more than 70 staff and volunteers since the war began in 2011.16\n",
