In 2009, in a revised WHO classification system, dengue fever was further divided into dengue with or without warning signs and severe dengue [7]. Since dengue is the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease in the world [7] and as a larger proportion of population is being affected, more unusual manifestations are being reported. In 2011, the WHO classification guidelines for dengue were revised and dengue was divided into DF, DHF without shock or with shock (DSS), and expanded dengue syndrome. According to its severity, DHF is divided in to four grades: DHF grade I, DHF grade II \u2013 DHF, DHF grade III, and DHF grade IV \u2013 DSS [8].",

These mechanisms can explain the varied systemic involvement in the majority of cases [4].

Briefly, oligonucleotide consensus primers were designed to anneal to any of the four dengue virus types and to amplify a 511-bp product in a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). First, we produced a cDNA copy of a portion of the viral genome in a reverse transcription reaction using primer D2, and we then carried out a standard PCR (35 cycles of heat denaturation, annealing, and primer extension) with the addition of primer D1. The resulting double-stranded DNA product of the RT-PCR was typed by a second round of PCR amplification (nested PCR) with type-specific primers, which yielded DNA products, the unique sizes of which were diagnostic for each dengue virus serotype.",

This is in concordance with studies done by Lum et al. [16], Le\u00e3o et al. [17], Araujo et al. [18], and Thomas et al. [19]. None of the patients in our study showed clinical signs of infection with other arboviruses, including West Nile virus (WNV), St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLE), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and yellow fever virus (YFV). This was further confirmed by reviewing the patient\u2019s past medical history, recent travel history, and vaccination record (especially yellow fever vaccination) to determine the likelihood that the current acute febrile illness was due to an infection with dengue virus. All of the 175 cases included in our study fulfilled the WHO case definition criteria for dengue. None of the patients in our study had a history of travel to regions where WNV and YFW are endemic. JEV is the only other flavivirus reported in sporadic cases in this study area. We did not observe any cross-reactivity with JEV-positive samples, which may be due to their grouping in a different serogroup. Furthermore the results of RT-PCR and CDC real-time PCR demonstrated a high degree of specificity for the dengue virus serotypes, with no cross-reaction observed with in serotypes and with serologically related flaviviruses such as JEV, WNV, and HCV. The Platelia dengue NS1 Ag assay for laboratory confirmation of dengue used in this study is highly specific [20] and revealed no positive results for YFV, WNV and JEV in our study. However, the only limitation of our study is that the types of samples used to determine specificity were limited, and more samples, especially from other flaviviral pathogens, such as St. Louis encephalitis virus and other related viruses in this group, need to be included to ensure adequate coverage of possible cross-reactions. Obtaining such sera that are negative for DENV antibody is sometimes not possible due to the high endemicity in the tropical belt.",

These findings indicate that the virus can cross the hematoencephalic barrier and infect the brain by microvascular or frank hemorrhage and its intrinsic neurotropism. Alternatively, the virus may be transported to the CNS by infected macrophages, with consequent dengue-induced encephalitis. Some complications such as hypotension, cerebral edema, hyponatremia, and fulminant hepatic failure might also be implicated as possible causes of dengue encephalopathy. Dengue encephalitis was observed in 7.4 % of our cases and was caused by serotypes 2 and 3. This is in concordance with studies done by Araujo et al. and Solomon et al. [18, 27].
