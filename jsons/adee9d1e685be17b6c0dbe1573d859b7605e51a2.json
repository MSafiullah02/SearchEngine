            "text": "Due to the increasing levels of population migration, travel, and relocation from rural to urban regions, infectious diseases that were once under control, such as Ebola [1] and measles [2] , have begun to resurface [3, 4] . An outbreak of such a disease may become an epidemic if no preventive measures are undertaken, nor mitigation strategies are implemented. Worse still, the high interconnection degree between cities or countries extremely favors the spreading of a disease throughout the entire world, which may become a pandemic in a matter of months, weeks, or even days. This is what recently happened with the COVID-19 disease, declared as a pandemic on March 11, 2020 , by the World Health Organization (WHO) [5, 6] . Thus, nowadays researchers across multiple disciplines model disease propagation to develop strategies that could prevent or at least curtail epidemics (and pandemics, in the worst cases). Infectious diseases usually propagate through physical contacts among individuals [3, 7] , and researchers have found that modeling these contact patterns [8, 9] is best achieved using complex networks [10] [11] [12] [13] , in which individuals and their interactions are represented by nodes and links, respectively. Numerous disease propagation models have made use of complex networks, including the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) [7, 10, 13] and susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) [3, 10, [13] [14] [15] [16] models. In these epidemic models, individuals can be in different states. For example, infected (I) individuals carry the disease and can transmit it to susceptible (S) neighbors that are not immune to the disease, while recovered (R) individuals do not participate in the propagation process because they have either recovered from a previous infection or because they have died.",

In the discrete-time version of this model [7] , at each time step I individuals spread the disease to their S neighbors with the same probability \u03b2 \u2208 [0, 1], and switch to the R state t r time steps after being infected, where t r is the recovery time of the disease. The propagation reaches the final stage when the number of I individuals goes to zero. At this stage, the fraction R of recovered individuals indicates the extent of the infection, since all recovered individuals were once infected. In this model, the spreading is controlled by the effective probability of infection T = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b2) tr , the transmissibility, with T \u2208 [0, 1]. When T is below a critical value T c , also called the epidemic threshold, the fraction R of recovered individuals, which is the order parameter of a continuous phase transition, is negligible compared to the system size N , and the system is in a non-epidemic phase. On the other hand, above T c the fraction R is comparable to N and thus it is said that the disease becomes an epidemic [16] [17] [18] [19] .",

In contrast, lockdown is a non-pharmacological strategy which consists in isolating individuals to prevent disease propagation. Nevertheless, a major drawback of this strategy is that it may cause a significant disruption in the economy of a region, because it implies a massive cut of social interactions. In addition, large-scale implementation of this mitigation strategy is challenging. On the other hand, there are other less extreme measures than lockdown with the same spirit. \"Social distancing\" strategies [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] are a set of measures for reducing contact between individuals (keep a minimum physical distance, work from home when possible, avoid crowded places, etc.), thus decreasing the probability of disease transmission. This approach assumes that an infection is more likely to be transmitted between people if they spend more time together, and thus the goal is to shorten the duration of interaction times. Social distancing strategies, along with partial or complete lockdown, have been undertaken in many countries to face the COVID-19 pandemic due to the absence of a vaccine and the fast propagation of the disease. These kind of measures respond to the direct transmission mechanism of the virus: it is expelled in the form of droplets from an infected individual through mouth and nose (when talking, exhaling, or coughing), and can get into a healthy individual (located within a 1 meter range, approximately, and facing the infected individual) through the mucous (eyes, nose, and mouth) [35] ; as individuals spend more time toghether the probability of infection increases.",

These kind of systems are known as disordered networks, which are characterized by the existing diversity in the strength or intensity of the interactions among the different parts of the system, and have been receiving much attention recently [11, 31, 33, 34] . In Ref. [34] disorder is implemented using a weighted complex network [11] , in which the weights associated with links represent the normalized contact times \u03c9 of the interaction between two individuals, and they follow a power law distribution, W (\u03c9) = 1/(a\u03c9) that resembles experimental results [9, 36, 37] . The parameter a is the disorder intensity that controls the range of allowable contact times in the distribution and their average value. Also, the interactions between individuals are categorized as either close (larger average contact time) or distant (shorter average contact time), each representing complementary fractions (f 1 and 1 \u2212 f 1 , respectively) of the total number of interactions. This is carried out by controlling the corresponding disorder intensity of the contact times distributions. Researchers have found that for a system in an epidemic phase (R > 0), when the fraction f 1 of close contacts is sufficiently small, increasing the disorder intensity of the distant interactions to decrease their average contact time may switch the system to a non-epidemic phase (R = 0).",

This cluster is formed by all the remaining susceptible (healthy) individuals that are connected with each other and it is the network that sustains the functionality of a society, e.g., the economy of a region. Using a generating function formalism, Newman [38] showed that in the SIR model there exists a second threshold T * above which the giant cluster of susceptible individuals vanishes at the final stage. On the other hand, Valdez et al. [32] showed that T * is an important parameter to determine the efficiency of a mitigation or control strategy, because any strategy that manages to decrease the transmissibility below T * can protect a large and connected cluster of susceptible individuals, even when the system is in an epidemic state.",

Thus, the modeling of interconnected networks, i.e., networks of networks (NoN) or multilayer networks, has become utterly relevant as it allows a more accurate representation of real systems. The ubiquity of the NoN has encouraged researchers to use them in the study of several topics such as cascading failure [43] [44] [45] , social dynamic [46, 47] , and disease propagation [48] [49] [50] . Particularly, the SIR model was simulated and solved theoretically in an overlapped multiplex network [51] system consisting of two individual networks or layers, in which a fraction q of shared nodes (q overlapping) is present in both layers. These shared individuals connect the different layers, and their presence makes diseases more likely to spread as q increases [51] .",

Here we use a Poisson distribution P (k) = e \u2212 k k k /k! which is homogeneous, being the average connectivity k the most probable value, and allows to easily obtain some analytical results, and a power law distribution with exponential cutoff k c , P (k) \u221d k \u2212\u03bb e \u2212k/kc , which is heterogeneous and is more representative of real-word networks, where some individuals may have a high number of contacts while the majority has only a few. We consider the exponential cutoff k c in the power law distribution as real-world networks are finite and the maximum number of connections of a node is limited by the size of the system [16] . Additionally, each layer is a weighted network in which links have associated weights \u03c9, where \u03c9 is a normalized contact time that defines the intensity of the interaction between two individuals. The \u03c9 values are taken from the theoretical distribution W i (\u03c9) = 1/(a i \u03c9) [31, 34] , \u03c9 [e \u2212a i , 1], where a i is the disorder intensity of layer i = A, B.",

All individuals are initially susceptible, except for one that randomly becomes infected, called the patient zero. At each time step, infected individuals spread the disease to susceptible neighbors with a probability \u03b2\u03c9, where \u03b2 is the intrinsic infectivity of the disease, and infected individuals recover after t r time steps. The propagation stops when the number of infected individuals is zero in both layers. By using the model described above, we can write the transmissibility of the disease in layer [54] . Note that T a i is a decreasing function of the disorder intensity a i because, since \u03c9 [e \u2212a i , 1], for higher a i values shorter contact times become more probable, and hence the disease is less likely to propagate. This allows us to implement a social distancing strategy by increasing the disorder intensity a i in layer i. On the other hand, in the limit a i \u2192 \u221e we have that T a i \u2192 0, which is a complete lockdown scenario where each individual is isolated from the rest. On the other hand, in the limit a i \u2192 0 there is no disorder in layer i, then the infection probabilities throughout layer i are all simply equal to \u03b2, recovering the original SIR model in which the transmissibility is T a i \u2192 T = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b2) tr .",

We want to analyze whether or not we can find a pair of disorder intensity values (a A , a B ) (or a set of pairs of values) that prevent the disease from becoming an epidemic, and examine how they depend on the fraction q of shared nodes. In addition, we look for disorder intensity values that can prevent the total giant component of susceptible individuals GCS (composed of S nodes connected through both layers) to fall apart, which would certainly cause a significant disruption in the economy of a region or country. We remark that the social distancing strategy is applied before the disease starts spreading and during its evolution. This could represent an optimistic scenario, where the authorities of a particular region (e.g., city or country) are well informed about the existence of an infectious disease, and they immediately undertake strict measures to get the most out of them. In order to implement social distancing strategies, the structure of a population may have to be taken into consideration. For instance, the population could be divided into two layers: one layer representing essential workers (food supply and distribution systems, sanitary system, public transport, etc.), where social distancing is certainly difficult to apply (lower disorder intensity), while the other layer could represent people who stay at their homes and only go out to make necessary purchases, such as food and cleaning supplies, for medical care or to do paperwork, where it is usually easier for the individuals to keep a safe distance from the others (higher disorder intensity). In this structured system, it is reasonable that a fraction q of individuals may belong to both groups of people.",

Note that in Fig. 1 (a) the system can be either in an epidemic phase, where R > 0, or in a non-epidemic phase, where only small outbreaks take place and hence it is considered that R = 0. When a B is below a critical value a Bc , so that T B > T Bc , the average contact time in layer B is longer and hence the interactions between individuals in that layer. Therefore, the disease is more likely to propagate and switch the system to an epidemic phase. Conversely, when a B \u2265 a Bc (T \u2264 T Bc ), shortening the average contact time limits the spread of the disease down to a negligible fraction of individuals, which avoids an epidemic (non-epidemic phase). Also, we observe that GCS increases with a B , as the giant cluster of susceptible individuals is less affected due to the curtail of the spread of the disease. On the other hand, in Fig. 1 (b) the distancing between individuals is not enough to prevent an epidemic, but it can preserve the GCS if a B is above a critical value a B * .",

Besides, if there is an epidemic in the system, social distancing may prevent the GCS to fall apart, thus keeping the system functional. In addition to the computational simulations, in the next section we introduce a theoretical approach that facilitates the analysis of the phase space for R and GCS, at the final stage of the process. It has been demonstrated that in isolated networks the final stage of the SIR model [3, 10, [13] [14] [15] [16] maps exactly into link percolation [16, 53, 55] in which links between nodes are occupied with probability p. Thus, the relevant magnitudes of this model can be obtained theoretically. The mapping holds in the thermodynamic limit, where N \u2192 \u221e, and considering that the number of recovered individuals is zero unless they are above a threshold s c [19] , which distinguishes between an epidemic and a small outbreak. In isolated complex networks, the critical transmissibility for which the system switches from an epidemic to a non-epidemic phase is T c = 1/(\u03ba \u2212 1), where \u03ba = k 2 / k is the branching factor of the network, and k and k 2 are the first and second moments of the degree distribution P (k), respectively [15, 16] .",

Each curve shows the critical value a Bc as a function of a A for a given fraction q of shared nodes, separating the epidemic phase (R > 0 below the curve) from the epidemic-free phase (R = 0 above the curve). As a A increases a Bc decreases, indicating that for shorter contacts in layer A, the critical average duration of interactions in layer B becomes larger. The effect of the shared nodes is reflected on the increase of the a Bc values for fixed a A as q increases, because these nodes facilitate the propagation between layers, which in addition widens the epidemic phase. Note that in the limit a A \u2192 \u221e, a Bc approximates to the critical disorder intensity in an isolated network, a B\u221e , as T Bc \u2192 1/(\u03ba B \u2212 1)-see Eq. (6)-for all q values (in Ref. [34] , this result corresponds to a single layer with f 1 = 0). This is because as a A \u2192 \u221e there is complete isolation between the individuals in layer A, and thus the spread of the disease in only possible in layer B. An analogous analysis holds for a A\u221e , which is the critical disorder intensity in layer A when it is isolated. Note also that for a A < a A\u221e there is no critical value a Bc (gray-colored region in Fig. 3) , and therefore an epidemic cannot be avoided even if we completely isolate the individuals in layer B. This analysis shows that the negative effect of the interconnection between layers means that, to prevent an epidemic in the system, the disorder intensities in both layers must be above the critical values corresponding to the isolated-layer case. while it is in a non-epidemic phase above (R = 0). Note that the epidemic phase widens as q increases, since the shared nodes ease the spreading of the disease. The results correspond to two layers with a power law degree distribution with \u03bb A = \u03bb B = 2.35, exponential cutoff k c = 20, k min = 2, and k max = 250, so that the single layer critical disorder intensity is a A\u221e = a B\u221e \u2248 2.3.",

In region II the distancing is moderate and the epidemic can not be avoided, but there is still a GCS, which means that the system remains functional (E-F). Finally, in region III the disease is certainly likely to spread because the disorder intensities are quite low, which not only fails to prevent an epidemic but also makes the GCS to fall apart, causing the system to collapse (E-NF). Considering this, even though the social distancing efforts may not prevent that a particular disease extends through a significant portion of the population, they could serve to the purpose of keeping the integrity of the system. It is important to note that, if a GCS remains functional after the end of an epidemic, it is highly recommended not to relax the set of measures undertaken to prevent the transmission of the disease, since there is always the possibility of a second outbreak (originating, for instance, from an imported or undetected case).",

When the disorder intensity in a layer is below its critical value for q = 0 (the isolated-layer case), an epidemic cannot be avoided, even when the individuals in the other layer are completely isolated. However, we find that it is still possible to protect the functional network of susceptible individuals through social distancing policies, i.e., by increasing the disorder intensity. This is fundamental to keep running the economy of a society. In the best case scenario, when the disorder intensity in a layer is above its critical value for q = 0, we find that there is a critical disorder intensity in the other layer that can reduce the epidemic size to zero. All the critical values increase with the overlapping q because the individuals that are shared by the layers ease the spread of disease, so that more social distancing measures must be undertaken to prevent an epidemic. All in all, the control of contact times between individuals can serve as a prevention strategy that overcomes the overlapping effect in multiplex networks, preventing not only an epidemic, but also the economic collapse of a region or country, which might be equally bad.",

A strict social distancing policy (i.e., high disorder intensities in both layers) ensures the system to lie on a non-epidemic and functional phase (region I, NE-F phase). As the distancing policies are relaxed, the emergence of an epidemic becomes more likely (region II, E-F phase), and if the policies are rather week even the GCS falls apart, disrupting the functionality of the system (region III, E-NF phase). The results correspond to two layers with a power law degree distribution, with \u03bb A = \u03bb B = 2.35, exponential cutoff k c = 20, k min = 2, k max = 250, and q = 0.3. Also we consider \u03b2 = 0.1 and t r = 7.",
