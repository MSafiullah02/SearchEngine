            "text": "Hotels are designed to provide high overall comfort and multi-faceted services to guests frequently accustomed to, and willing to pay for exclusive amenities, treatment, and entertainment. Comfortable indoor environment, safety, and reliability are some of the amenities valued by guests. However, little research has been published about the indoor air quality (IAQ) of hotel buildings up to now and most hotel managers often ignore these important issues [1], [2]. On the other hand, state-of-the-art technical infrastructure is typically utilized in hotels to provide high levels of comfort, especially thermal comfort. Nevertheless, using energy-intensive space-conditioning systems does not warrant absolute guest\u2019s satisfaction [1], [3]. Guests frequently complain about thermal discomfort, even where expensive and sophisticated systems are operated. Complaints in hotels are most commonly related to uncomfortable air temperatures (too high or too low), and to the difficulty or impossibility of individual adjustment [3]. Moreover, space conditioning (heating, cooling, and ventilation for the purpose of maintaining high standards of air quality and thermal comfort) typically accounts for about half the total energy consumed in hotels [4], [5]. Hence, most hotel designers and managers always pay attention only to the energy consumption of hotels operation. Managers take the management of resources as a major role that inevitably leads to housekeeping\u2019s greater emphasis on those tasks with visual satisfaction. Nevertheless, hotels are public places accommodating a vast variety of international travellers; therefore the demand for good IAQ may be higher than for other types of buildings [6].",

However, inadequate air quality as well as the lack of air circulation is another frequent complaint. In addition, the IAQ of hotel buildings affects the health of guests especially in terms of bacterial contamination. For example, Legionnaire\u2019s disease broke out in one USA hotel (182 people illness and 29 deaths in 1976) and more than 60 outbreaks worldwide in hotels, hospitals and offices were reported [7], [8], [9]. Furthermore, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) broke out in \u201cM\u201d hotel in Hong Kong has increased the public awareness to indoor air quality of hotels [8].",

European Standardization Organization (CEN) has drafted several standards to help the member countries implementing the directive. One of these is the \u2018\u2018Indoor environmental input parameters for design and assessment of energy performance of buildings\u201d, addressing IAQ, thermal environment, lighting and acoustics [11]. The standard specifies design values for indoor environment, values to be used in energy calculations, and methods to verify the specified indoor environment in the buildings [12]. However it does not establish a methodology for IAQ audits of buildings. Portugal, as one of the European Union member states, approved a series of national laws to implement the EPBD [13], [14], [15], stating simultaneously that IAQ monitoring of the existing non residential buildings is mandatory, under the rules of RSECE [14]. However, it is not the case for most of the member countries.",

Regarding the uniformity of the distribution of the CO2 concentration inside the room, it was not possible to put in practice, previous to the decay phase, the recommended procedure of using a fan during a short period to promote a good dilution, on account of the hotel guests privacy issues. Nevertheless, it was latter checked that in a similar room where an equilibrium concentration of 1100 ppm had been achieved after the sleeping period, the spatial variability of CO2 concentration was in the order of \u00b115 ppm.

During night hours, the concentration level of CO2 increased due to the constant metabolic emission by the guests in the rooms and the AER revealed to be insufficient. Regarding the CO2 concentration, the verification of compliance with the national regulation limit value (1000 ppm) must take into account the actual occupancy of the room. For this purpose, the technical note NT-SCE-02, 2009 [17] suggests the following criterion:(4)([CO2]MedT\u2212[CO2]Ext)\u00d7Nocup.maxNocup.+[CO2]Ext\u2264[CO2]MRwhere [CO2]MR is reference limit value of CO2 concentration, 1800 mg/m3 (corresponding to 1000 ppm at standard pressure and 25 \u00b0C [10]), [CO2]Ext is the CO2 concentration in the outdoor air (400 ppm for this case), [CO2]MedT is time-averaged concentration of CO2 in each sampling point in ppm, N\nocup.max. is maximum allowed number of occupants in the room or space, N\nocup is the actual number of occupants during the measurements.",
