Examination for bacteria is not routine in bronchiolitis management. However, it is plausible that secondary bacterial infection that occur post viral infections15 are more likely when the nasopharynx is colonized with bacteria, as found in some populations such as in Northern Territory Indigenous infants. In these children, early (at \u223c2 weeks of age), common (up to 90% of infants) and dense acquisition of respiratory bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis)\n16 have been documented. Thus, in study settings like ours, the presence of bacteria in the nasopharynx may be particularly relevant. Secondary bacterial infection may complicate bronchiolitis, and possibly contribute to poorer long\u2010term outcomes such as chronic wet cough17 and bronchiectasis.18 It has been shown in children aged \u22643 years hospitalized with first time wheezing, co\u2010detection of viruses (93%) and bacteria (60%) in nasopharyngeal aspirates resulted in prolonged LOS.19 Yet, it remains unknown whether co\u2010detection of bacteria with viruses in the nasopharynx at the point of bronchiolitis hospitalization contributes to LOS. This data is lacking and is especially important for populations at high risk of poorer outcomes (e.g. secondary bacterial pneumonia, chronic wet cough etc).4, 17 Further rationale for assessing viruses and bacteria in the infants involved in our studies was described in a previous paper.20 \n",

Our results are similar to some studies,9, 11 but dissimilar to others where RSV and/or HRV influenced disease severity.8, 34, 35 Reasons for these variations are likely multi\u2010factorial including sample size, different methodologies, sampling frame, age, number and types of viruses investigated.11, 12 We also found that although respiratory bacteria (H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and M. catarrhalis) and/or viruses were common (88%), their presence did not prolong LOS. While data relating to LOS and type of virus detection has been previously examined, none of these studies have examined the influence of the presence of bacteria in the upper airways. We found that the presence of bacteria detected in the nasopharynx with or without concurrent viruses did not influence LOS. Our finding of high prevalence of concurrent bacteria with viruses (i.e., 88%) in the children's nasopharynx is similar to that reported by Bisgaard and colleagues among young children of asthmatic mothers with acute wheeze in a non\u2010hospitalised cohort.36 \n",

Bronchiectasis is particularly common in Indigenous infants in the USA, Australia and New Zealand and hospitalization for respiratory disease is an independent risk factor.18 \n",

Our data raises an important public health issue with respect to follow\u2010up of children with bronchiolitis, to optimise clinical care beyond the immediate hospitalization phase to improve long\u2010term respiratory outcomes for high\u2010risk populations. We suggest that children should be clinically reviewed between weeks 3\u20134 after hospital discharge to assess for persistent symptoms and signs and managed accordingly. There is currently no high quality evidence on the most appropriate intervention in any groups of children with post\u2010bronchiolitis syndrome.41 However, until further evidence is available, we suggest the use of antibiotics when the cough is wet and not improving in a group at high risk of chronic suppurative lung disease, in line with the treatment of protracted bacterial bronchitis.42 \n",

Surprisingly, we found that presence of RSV on admission and \u201cany bacteria\u201d significantly reduced the odds of re\u2010hospitalization by 6 months post index hospitalization. Whether respiratory readmissions in this population were related to the initial bronchiolitis episode, a new infection or other causes can only be postulated. One possible reason for this could be that RSV detection is a marker (as opposed to a cause) for future asthma and as the majority of paediatric asthma is mild, having asthma is less likely to lead to re\u2010hospitalisation compared to a respiratory infection in our setting.",

Firstly, our sampling frame is restricted to Indigenous children without the well\u2010known, traditional risk factors (e.g. chronic lung disease, cardiac disease) and who did not require intensive care. Reasons for our sampling frame were discussed above but it also means our data cannot be extrapolated to the general population or to non\u2010hospitalized infants. Secondly, we did not exclude infants that had been hospitalized previously; however, exclusion of these infants did not alter our main results. Thirdly, 87% of children received antibiotics during hospitalization. This may have impacted on nasopharyngeal bacterial carriage, however removing these children did not alter our main results. Fourthly, the children were systematically reviewed only at one time point, that is, at 3 weeks post\u2010hospitalization. The decision by the treating paediatricians who reviewed these infants at a median of 7 months post\u2010hospitalization to subject the child to a chest CT scan was based on clinical assessments, not systemized and thus subject to external biases. Thus, we could not systematically analyze the factors on admission that are associated with future development of bronchiectasis. Also, while long\u2010term, prospective, follow\u2010up studies in high\u2010risk populations are required, we cannot unethically subject all children to a chest CT (given the known risk of radiation in young children).",

Persistent respiratory symptoms at 3 weeks increased the risk of detecting bronchiectasis and factors associated with persistent symptoms were prior hospitalisation for a respiratory illness and presence of bacteria on the NPS on admission. Thus, clinical review, with early treatment when necessary, should be undertaken in populations at high risk for chronic respiratory disease. Follow\u2010up studies beyond 6 months are necessary to consolidate our findings and determine intervention points that can reduce the high burden of respiratory diseases in at\u2010risk populations.",
