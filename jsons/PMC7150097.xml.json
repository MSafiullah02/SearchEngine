            "text": "Among carbohydrates, that is, monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides, the latter are considered the most suitable as encapsulation matrices due to their large molecular structure, which allows effective entrapment of bioactive ingredients (Fathi et al., 2014). Polysaccharides are very abundant and relatively inexpensive biopolymers (Mohan et al., 2015). They also possess different reactive groups in their structure, which facilitate interaction with a range of bioactive compounds and even allow functionalization of their backbone to achieve tailored functionalities, including the possibility of designing self-assembling structures for encapsulation (Palao-Suay et al., 2016). It must be noted, however, that the reactivity of their functional groups has also been envisaged as a disadvantage for the encapsulation of certain bioactive ingredients capable of reacting with them, generating toxic products and/or precluding their subsequent release (Mohan et al., 2015). Polysaccharides are very versatile due to the variety of chemical structures, functional groups, and molecular weights available, and the presence of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic motifs along their molecular chains (Santiago and Castro, 2016). Fig. 2.1\nshows the chemical structure of several polysaccharides that have been widely explored as encapsulation matrices. Other commonly used carbohydrates, such as pectins or some gums are a heterogeneous group of polymers and thus its chemical structure has not been represented. Another interesting feature of polysaccharides is the great stability of their structure, even under harsh temperature conditions, in contrast with proteins, which can be denatured during material processing at high temperatures. Furthermore, a number of polysaccharides are considered dietary fibers, being resistant to enzymatic degradation during oral, gastric, and small intestine digestion but vulnerable to microbial fermentation in the colon (Fathi et al., 2014). Most of the commonly used polysaccharides for encapsulation have a plant origin, such as starch, pectin, cellulose, alginate, or guar gum, but animal-derived polysaccharides, such as chitosan or those from bacterial origin, such as dextran are also widespread for this application. An exhaustive review highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each of them as delivery vehicles in food systems has been recently published (Fathi et al., 2014).",

            "text": "Food proteins are excellent candidates as microencapsulation matrices because, in addition to the protective effects they might exert on the bioactive ingredients, they have a high nutritional value and generally exhibit functional properties themselves (Ma et al., 2014), being considered the most nutritionally beneficial delivery systems (Mohan et al., 2015). Moreover, as Livney (2010) points out, some proteins are natural vehicles whose main function is to store, transport, and/or deliver essential compounds throughout the organism and, thus, they could also be exploited to deliver other molecules of interest. Especially taking into account that proteins are capable of binding both hydrophobic and hydrophilic small molecules (Considine and Flanagan, 2009), and they have self-assembling properties, surface activity, and good gelation characteristics (Livney, 2010). In general, proteins from animal origin, especially dairy proteins, but also gelatin and egg proteins, are more commonly employed than plant proteins for encapsulation purposes (Karaca et al., 2015). Some of the advantages of milk proteins over plant proteins include their higher solubility over a broader range of pH, their lower molecular weight, and their greater flexibility. On the other hand, plant proteins have a better acceptance from some groups of consumers and are generally less expensive (Karaca et al., 2015). The most widely used milk proteins are caseins and whey proteins, and their application as encapsulation vehicles has been recently reviewed by Tavares et al., (2014). Regarding plant proteins, soy proteins are the predominant choice as wall materials, being those obtained from pulses (such as pea, lentil, or chickpea) and cereal grains (for instance zein or barley protein) the most relevant alternatives (Karaca et al., 2015). Table 2.1\nshows some examples of food ingredients that have been encapsulated using proteins.\n",

            "text": "Natural polyphenols are a group of bioactive molecules that attract a great deal of interest in the food industry due to their great antioxidant activity and their many attributed health benefits. However, these compounds are very unstable and some of them have poor bioavailability and unpleasant tastes (Munin and Edwards-L\u00e9vy, 2011). Thus, many scientific works have dealt with microencapsulation of polyphenols to overcome these limitations, using different matrices and processing techniques (Fang and Bhandari, 2010). Robert et al., (2010) reported that the encapsulation efficiency for polyphenols extracted from pomegranate was higher when a soy protein isolate (SPI) rather than a maltodextrin (MD) was used as wall material, while the MD matrix provided greater protection during storage at high temperature (60\u00b0C). Higher encapsulation efficiencies and enhanced protection for (\u2013)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG, a green tea polyphenol) were also obtained when encapsulated in a protein matrix, namely gelatin, than when entrapped within the carbohydrate chitosan, both by spray-drying (G\u00f3mez-Mascaraque et al., 2016b) and electrospraying (G\u00f3mez-Mascaraque et al., 2015, G\u00f3mez-Mascaraque et al., 2016a). Similar encapsulation efficiencies as those obtained for chitosan (\u223c85%) had been previously obtained when EGCG was encapsulated within other carbohydrate-based matrices (Rocha et al., 2011). The better results obtained when polyphenols were encapsulated within protein matrices in these works might be related to the fact that these compounds generally exhibit complexing properties toward proteins (Munin and Edwards-L\u00e9vy, 2011). Furthermore, the bioaccessibility of EGCG after in vitro digestion was reported to be higher when gelatin was used as delivery vehicle as compared to the chitosan carriers (G\u00f3mez-Mascaraque et al., 2016a, G\u00f3mez-Mascaraque et al., 2016b).",

However, this method does not take into account the chemical nature of the wall materials, not being able to distinguish between materials with similar drying curves (P\u00e9rez-Alonso et al., 2003). Given that many protein and carbohydrate matrices are water soluble or water dispersible, and taking into account that processing in food-grade conditions (i.e., avoiding organic solvents) is imperative in the food industry, the encapsulation of bioactive oils and other lipophilic molecules usually involves the preparation of oil-in-water (o/w) emulsions prior to capsule formation. Thus, the ideal wall material for oil encapsulation should have good emulsifying properties (Jafari et al., 2008). In this sense, the amphiphilic nature of proteins is advantageous as they behave as good emulsifiers (McClements, 2004), allowing improved encapsulation efficiencies and oxidative stabilities (Karaca et al., 2015). For this reason, proteins have been the preferred matrices for the encapsulation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (G\u00f3mez-Mascaraque et al., 2016a, G\u00f3mez-Mascaraque et al., 2016b, Moomand and Lim, 2014, Perez et al., 2014) and essential oils (Abd El-Salam and El-Shibiny, 2015, Baranauskien\u0117 et al., 2006, Sutaphanit and Chitprasert, 2014) in many works. In general, carbohydrates have low surface activity (Barrow et al., 2013) and usually yield poor retention efficiencies (Jafari et al., 2008), although modification of some polysaccharides has also been proposed to overcome this limitation (Tesch et al., 2002, Trubiano and Lacourse, 1988). Also, some gums, such as gum arabic, contain small protein fractions that provide them with emulsifying properties (Gharsallaoui et al., 2007). Still, the suitability of some polysaccharides as encapsulation matrices for sensitive oils has been questioned. For instance, Kolanowski et al. (2006) reported that encapsulation of fish oil within modified cellulose by spray-drying did not improve its oxidative stability. In another work, Gallardo et al. (2013) claimed that microencapsulation of linseed oil within spray-dried gum arabic did increase its thermal stability, but a great loss of \u03b1-linolenic acid was observed upon fortification of bread with these capsules, suggesting limited application of the polysaccharide-based formulation in real food systems. On the other hand, addition of a whey protein isolate to the wall material further improved the thermal stability of the encapsulated oil. More recently, Santhanam et al. (2015) encapsulated fish oil within sodium caseinate, MD, and soy protein and supplemented cakes with the capsules. Their results showed that, among the different matrices, the milk protein was the matrix that yielded the best oxidative stability, which also demonstrated desirable organoleptic characteristics. Indeed, milk proteins are usually smaller and more flexible than vegetal proteins, being more efficiently absorbed at the W/O interface and hence better stabilizing the emulsions (Karaca et al., 2015). Umesha et al. (2015) also proved that milk proteins (specifically sodium caseinate and whey protein concentrate) achieved higher encapsulation efficiencies and provided enhanced oxidative stability to cress seed oil as compared to a carbohydrate-based matrix (blend of MD and gum arabic). Conversely, Al-Ismail et al. (2015) concluded that gum arabic yielded better encapsulation efficiency and oil retention during storage than whey protein isolate for a cardamom essential oil. In summary, although controversy exists among different works, proteins seem to generally yield better results than polysaccharides as wall materials for the encapsulation of oils, which can be explained in light of their excellent emulsifying properties, forming a protective film at the o/w interface.",

            "text": "Carotenoids are a group of natural pigments with many attributed health benefits when consumed in sufficient levels, some of which also exhibit provitamin A activity (Qian et al., 2012). Together with polyphenols, carotenoids are the most abundant phytochemicals (Kaulmann et al., 2016). However, they have a very low water solubility and poor chemical stability, resulting in low bioaccessibility upon consumption. Dissolution of carotenoids in edible oils has shown to increase absorption in vitro and in vivo (Ribeiro et al., 2010), and thus o/w emulsions are often prepared before capsule production as a suitable strategy to both increase their bioaccessibility and disperse them in aqueous biopolymer solutions or dispersions. Therefore, some of the previous discussion regarding the encapsulation of bioactive oils could be applied to carotenoids. In this sense, P\u00e9rez-Masi\u00e1 et al. (2015) showed that higher encapsulation efficiencies were obtained when lycopene (previously dissolved in a soy bean oil) was microencapsulated using a whey protein matrix as compared to carbohydrate-based matrices, such as dextran or chitosan. Robert et al. (2003) also obtained higher encapsulation efficiencies for the main carotenoid pigments present in an oleoresin from rosa mosqueta upon spray-drying within gelatin capsules than using starch as wall material. Furthermore, gelatin provided a greater protective effect on the main carotenoids, especially on trans-\u03b2-carotene, than starch. However, information on the bioavailability of these microencapsulated carotenoids during in vitro digestion is scarce (Donhowe and Kong, 2014). Being the bioaccessibility of carotenoids one of their main limitations to exert their bioactivities, this feature should be carefully addressed when selecting a wall material for encapsulation. For instance, alginate has been proposed as a desirable encapsulation matrix for its ability to protect carotenoids from the acidic conditions during gastric digestion, and indeed, Zhang et al. (2016) have recently shown that it effectively protected \u03b2-carotene from degradation during digestion. However, the encapsulation within alginate beads caused a reduction in \u03b2-carotene bioaccessibility due to insufficient release. The bioaccessibility of carotenoids relays on their incorporation into mixed micelles (Fern\u00e1ndez-Garc\u00eda et al., 2009, Qian et al., 2012), and research suggests that some polysaccharides, such as alginates or pectins, significantly inhibit micelle formation; and hence carotenoids absorption (Riedl et al., 1999, Yonekura and Nagao, 2009). On the other hand, soluble proteins have also been shown to impede incorporation of carotenoids into the oil phase of the gastric emulsion (Rich et al., 2003), although this limitation might be overcome if carotenoids are previously incorporated in o/w emulsions prior to their encapsulation within protein capsules.",

            "text": "Probiotics are a particular group of bioactive ingredients. They are defined as \u201clive microorganisms which, when consumed in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit to the host\u201d (Pineiro and Stanton, 2007), so they must be alive and metabolically active at the time of consumption. However, a number of studies report low levels of viable probiotic cells in commercial products (Al-Otaibi, 2009, Lin et al., 2006, Shah et al., 2000, Weese, 2002), emphasizing the need for their microencapsulation. The choice of potential matrices for this group of ingredients is more restricted, as the processing conditions must be adequate to warranty their survival. Moreover, to adequately protect the cells from the acidic environment of the stomach and efficiently deliver them to the intestine, the ideal matrix for their encapsulation should be stable at low pHs and disrupt at pHs above 6 (Gbassi and Vandamme, 2012). For these reasons, one of the preferred matrices for the encapsulation of probiotic bacteria is alginate (Dong et al., 2013). Other anionic polysaccharides with gelling capacity, such as carrageenans have also been used, although their processing at mild temperatures is problematic (Mangione et al., 2003, Yuguchi et al., 2002). Proteins, especially milk proteins, are relevant alternatives to alginate for the microencapsulation of probiotics (El-Salam and El-Shibiny, 2015). Rodrigues et al. (2011) assessed the viability of probiotic bacteria when immobilized in different food-grade polymers and found that whey proteins, together with alginate, were the most adequate materials for most of the strains they tested. Nevertheless, the results were strain-dependent, emphasizing the need for designing the encapsulation system for each specific bioactive ingredient. Lopez-Rubio et al. (2012) also observed that a whey protein concentrate (WPC) exerted enhanced protection to Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bb12 during storage at high relative humidity as compared with a polysaccharide, namely pullulan, both processed by electrospraying. Electrosprayed WPC-based capsules were also used to protect a strain of Lactobacillus plantarum (CECT 748 T), which experienced a reduced viability loss during in vitro digestion (\u223c3 log CFU g\u22121) (Gomez-Mascaraque et al., 2016). In contrast, alginate-encapsulated L. plantarum (strain UFRGS BL011) suffered a viability loss of almost 3 log CFU mL\u22121 when exposed to simulated gastric juice, and an additional drop of 3 log CFU mL\u22121 when exposed to simulated intestinal juice (Coghetto et al., 2016). However, these results are not directly comparable, since the protected L. plantarum strain is different and the protocols employed for simulation of gastrointestinal conditions also differ. It is worth noting that alginate microcapsules have already been successfully incorporated into real food matrices, such as ice creams, frozen yogurts, and mayonnaise (Corona-Hernandez et al., 2013). The microencapsulation of probiotics has been specifically examined in a number of recent review articles (De Prisco and Mauriello, 2016, El-Salam and El-Shibiny, 2015, Iravani et al., 2015).",

Therefore, combinations of them have also been studied as wall materials with the aim of improving the attributes of the individual biopolymers (Bastos et al., 2012, Fernandes et al., 2014, Smilkov et al., 2014). For instance, addition of proteins to MDs, which are considered to be one of the best thermal defenders (Munin and Edwards-L\u00e9vy, 2011) for microencapsulation by spray-drying, allows it to increase the powder recovery of the materials (Muzaffar and Kumar, 2016, Shi et al., 2013), while incorporation of dextrins to proteins as encapsulant material for fish oil increased its oxidative stability (Kagami et al., 2003). Aberkane et al. (2014) observed that the combination of pectin with pea protein for the microencapsulation of PUFA-rich oil enhanced its oxidative stability as compared with the pea protein alone. However, protein-polysaccharide combinations do not always perform better than the individual components. Mehyar et al. (2014) obtained better overall results by encapsulation of cardamom oil within a SPIthan using mixtures of the protein with either guar gum or carrageenan. Also, complexation of proteins with polysaccharides (Benichou et al., 2002) represents a widely used strategy for the encapsulation of bioactive ingredients (Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 2013, Jain et al., 2015, Nori et al., 2011, Piacentini et al., 2013), being coacervation the second most exploited encapsulation technique in the food industry (Dias et al., 2015). Furthermore, proteins and carbohydrates can be conjugated by dry heating through the Maillard reaction (Martins et al., 2000), and these conjugates have also been recently applied to the encapsulation of food ingredients. Davidov Pardo et al. (2015) developed caseinate\u2013dextran coated zein nanoparticles and used them to encapsulate resveratrol, enhancing its bioaccessibility. Coating the nanoparticles with these Maillard complexes resulted in a greater stability to aggregation under simulated gastrointestinal conditions as compared to those coated with plain caseinate. Ifeduba and Akoh (2016) used the Maillard reaction to crosslink gelatin-gum arabic coacervates to improve the oxidative stability stearidonic acid soybean oil. In addition, Maillard reaction products have been described to exhibit antioxidant properties, but the last stages of the reaction can lead to undesirable color and aromas, and even to toxic compounds in certain cases (Tessier and Niquet, 2007), facts that should be considered when designing this type of carriers.",

            "text": "Although optical microscopy is the most easily accessible and low-cost imaging technique, its main drawback is its relatively low resolution, which is limited by the diffraction of light to about 1000 diameters magnification (Luykx et al., 2008). As an alternative, electron microscopes offer much higher magnifications, which enable the characterization of particles with size ranges from tenths of nm to tenths of \u03bcm. Among the electron microscopy techniques, transmission electron (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are the most widely used ones. TEM is a technique that is based on the transmission of a beam of electrons through an ultrathin sample. The major limitation from this technique lays in the tedious sample preparation that is often required. First of all, the samples have to be thin enough to be electron transparent and must be dry to be subjected to the high vacuum present inside the instrument. Additionally, negative staining is often required to increase the contrast between the sample and the background. This involves placing a small amount of the sample on a TEM grid and staining with a solution (such as uranyl acetate), which provides high contrast. To obtain information about the particle internal structure, the sample can be subjected to the freeze-fracture technique. In this case, the sample is placed on the TEM grid, which is then vitrified by rapid freezing and subsequently fractured under constant cooling and vacuum. It is evident that these preparation procedures are likely to have a strong impact on the structure of the sample, especially in the case of biological samples and moisture sensitive materials. SEM presents lower resolution than TEM, but it has a greater depth of view (thus providing more information on the particle surface structure) and the sample preparation is usually less complex. This technique is based on scanning a beam of electrons across the surface of the sample, providing information on the sample surface topography and composition. SEM requires high vacuum and sample conductivity, which is again translated into possible structural modifications induced by the drying and coating processes applied to the sample specimens. As an alternative, atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a more recent technique in which a physical sharp probe is scanned over a specimen that has been previously immobilized onto a surface. The surface topography of the sample is resolved by determining the reaction of the probe to the forces that the sample imposes on it when scanned. One of the main advantages of AFM, apart from its high resolution (ca. 0.1 nm) is the fact that, unlike SEM, the samples do not need to present a conductive surface. This type of microscopy is, however, not suitable for surfaces that are soft or sticky. In those cases, the sample may need to be dried prior to the analysis.",

The separation of different constituents in a sample is done on the basis of the different speeds at which distinct compounds travel through a structure (usually a column) containing a specific material (known as stationary phase) when dissolved in a certain fluid (known as mobile phase). The final step after separating the components in the sample consists in the quantification of each component by using a suitable detector, such as an ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) light absorbance detector, a fluorescence detector, or a diffractometer. The advantage of chromatographic techniques is that they offer a range of possibilities (mobile and stationary phases, type of separation technique, detector type) that can be adjusted depending on the particular composition and properties of the encapsulated system.",

Depending on the type of stationary phase, the mechanism for the separation of compounds in the sample will be different, giving rise to a range of chromatographic separation methods. For instance, the separation may occur on the basis of the molecular mass of the different compounds [size exclusion chromatography (SEC) or gel permeation chromatography (GPC)] or the charge (cation or anion exchange chromatography). In addition to HPLC, GC coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is also one of the most widely used techniques to separate and quantify compounds that can be vaporized without affecting their molecular structure. In this case, after the compounds in the sample travel through the chromatographic column and are released (with different retention times), the coupled mass spectrometer breaks down the molecular structure of each component into ionized fragments, separates the ions of differing masses, and determines their relative abundance by measuring the intensity of the ion flux.",

This technique can be applied to any kind of sample, in the solid or solution state, which contains nuclei possessing spin. In the particular case of encapsulating systems, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR techniques have been used to prove the formation of stabilizing inclusion complexes between \u03b2-cyclodextrins and essential oils (del Toro-S\u00e1nchez et al., 2010, R\u01ceileanu et al., 2013) or to determine the molecular state of curcuminoids encapsulated in poly(butyl) cyanoacrylate nanoparticles (Mulik et al., 2009). Another interesting fact is that this technique is sensitive to dynamics, that is, it is possible to discern molecular domains with distinct mobility. This can be exploited to determine the level of molecular interaction established between different components in encapsulating materials. For instance, the level of interaction between silica matrices and encapsulated ibuprofen molecules has been estimated based on the ibuprofen molecular mobility deduced from 13C and 1H spectra (Babonneau et al., 2004).

SLC measures the average intensity of scattered light arriving at the detector, although actually, the intensity shows fluctuations over short time scales. Moreover, in the case of solutions, the Brownian motion of particles causes fluctuations in the intensity of the scattered light arriving at the detector. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) is based on the measurements of these fluctuations as a function of time. By analyzing these fluctuations through correlation functions, it is possible to extract information regarding the particle size. DLS is commonly used to characterize the particle size of encapsulating systems based on microemulsions (Flanagan et al., 2006, Gaysinsky et al., 2008, Yin et al., 2012, Zhong et al., 2009, Ziani et al., 2012). The main issue of SLC and DLS methods is that highly diluted samples are often required to avoid multiple scattering (i.e., the photons are scattered more than once between the light source and the detector).

Specifically for SANS, the scattering length difference existing between hydrogen (\u22120.3742 \u00d7 1010 cm\u20132) and its heavier isotope, deuterium (0.6671 \u00d7 1010 cm\u20132), is the basis of the contrast variation method. This is an extraordinary valuable approach used to enhance the SLD of hydrogen-containing samples or to selectively match desired components in a multicomponent system by using different H2O/D2O mixtures.",

On the contrary, the main drawback of small angle scattering techniques is that they are indirect methods and mathematical models have to be applied to describe the experimental scattering curves. These models require prior knowledge of the system to be built and, therefore, it is of outmost importance to combine small angle scattering techniques with complementary methods, such as microscopy and spectroscopy techniques.

(2008) reported on the structural characterization of soybean lecithin/chitosan nanoparticles loaded with a lipophilic positively charged drug used in breast cancer therapy by combining cryo-TEM, static light scattering, and SAXS and SANS techniques. By applying proper models to describe the experimental scattering data, it was possible to determine the structure of the encapsulating vesicles, as well as the interactions established between the matrix and the encapsulated drug. The unilamellar structure of liposomes loaded with antibiotics has also been investigated by means of SAXS characterization (Colzi et al., 2015). The internal structure of poly(lactide-co-glucolide)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PLGA-PEG) nanoparticles, commonly used as drug carrier systems, was resolved by finding a proper model (consisting of fractal structures with polydisperse spherical building blocks) to simultaneously fit the SANS experimental data from the nanoparticles dispersed in two different H2O/D2O mixtures (Yang et al., 2015). This allowed identifying the release mechanism of a hydrophilic anticancer drug, such as carboplatin, when incorporated into the PLGA-PEG nanoparticles. The distinct SLD contrast generated when using neutrons and X-rays was exploited to characterize microemulsions embedded in alginate hydrogels (Josef et al., 2013). Whereas X-rays provided a low SLD contrast between the microemulsion and the alginate gel (thus probing the structure of the whole system), the use of neutrons enhanced the SLD contrast between the two phases, hence highlighting the structure of the microemulsion droplets embedded within the gel. In another study, fractal analysis and evaluation of the particle distance distribution function from SAXS experiments evidenced the structural changes undergone by bovine serum albumin when combined with chitosan and poly(sodium-4-styrene) sulphonate to produce core-shell nanoparticles loaded with ibuprofen for controlled release of the drug (Varga et al., 2014). Liu et al. (2011) investigated the release of an enzyme encapsulated in freeze-dried chitosan/xanthan gum hydrogels and observed that the release was triggered by lowering the pH of the medium. On the other hand, the addition of montmorillonite (MMT) nanoclay into the hydrogels was seen to stabilize the system, lowering the enzyme release rate. The use of WAXS and SAXS was crucial to explaining the stabilizing effect of MMT. Although WAXS evidenced that a high degree of MMT intercalation within the chitosan/xanthan gum blend was achieved, SAXS showed that the incorporation of MMT reduced the structural changes undergone by the hydrogels when the pH of the medium was modified. The encapsulation of a vitamin into spray-dried protein-stabilized emulsions was evaluated and the vitamin stability was linked to structural changes by combining light scattering and differential scanning calorimetry with SAXS characterization (Relkin et al., 2014). The formation of lamellar structures as a result of the packing of the fatty phase, evidenced by the presence of a Bragg peak in the SAXS patterns, was seen to reduce the vitamin degradation.",

Among the most widely researched biodegradable thermoplastics, sustainable biopolymers for monolayer packaging applications are starch, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), and PLA. Specifically, starch and PLA biopolymers are, undoubtedly, the most interesting families of biodegradable materials, as they have become commercially available, being produced in a large industrial scale. Of particular interest in food packaging is the case of PLA due to its excellent transparency and relatively good water resistance. However, as already commented, the main challenge for these specific biomaterials is to improve their properties so that they perform (in terms of barrier and thermal properties) like polyethylene terephthalate (PET).",

In general, one of the main disadvantages of these biopolymers is that they are permeable, in more or less extent, to low molecular weight compounds (i.e., water vapor, oxygen, and aroma compounds), which can compromise packaged food quality and safety. In the particular case of starch, although native starch is not an inherently thermoplastic material, it can be processed like conventional polymers, giving raise to what is known as thermoplastic starch (TPS), after some specific processing steps. However, TPS shows several drawbacks that reduce their applicability as packaging material, such as their highly hydrophilic character, limited mechanical properties, and the retrogradation phenomenon that occurs during ageing (Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2012). To avoid this problem, several studies have been focused on the optimization of the physicochemical properties of packages and the minimization of food-package interactions, such as gas or aroma migration, by developing nanocomposites and multilayer food packaging structures.",

However, it is well known that the most efficient structure to constitute high barrier materials using two element components is for them to be disposed in a layered form (Fabra et al., 2013). This methodology has been widely used in synthetic polymers but it has been barely developed in biodegradable food packaging systems because it is difficult to assemble materials thermodynamically immiscible without the addition of synthetic adhesives. In fact, one of the main challenges in the development of multilayer biobased and biodegradable films is to achieve good adhesion between layers. Interestingly, both electrospinning and layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly can at the same time be used to enhance physicochemical and barrier properties of packaging materials and for the entrapment of functional compounds to develop active packaging structures (Fabra et al., 2013, Fabra et al., 2015, Fabra et al., 2016d, Fabra et al., 2016b). In this regard, Fabra et al., 2014a, Fabra et al., 2014b, Fabra et al., 2015 have successfully developed hydrophobic coatings or interlayers with bioadhesive properties to improve the barrier and functional performance of biodegradable polymers combining biomass-derived nanocomposites and the electrospinning process.

Specifically, Fabra et al.

As opposed to the PHA\u2019s materials performance, PLA did not improve the water vapor permeability values of these films. However, not only the nature of the outer layers but also the morphology, thickness, and the inherent barrier of the electrospun interlayer materials determine the oxygen and water vapor barrier properties of the overall multilayer. For instance, Fabra et al.

As opposed to the earlier mentioned structures obtained by using electrospun bioadhesives, the structures developed by sandwiching thermoplastic proteins and polysaccharides-based films with electrospun hydrophobic coatings were not high barrier materials and they could be used for some fresh produce (e.g., mushroom, strawberry) with high respiration rates that require packaging films with high oxygen and carbon dioxide permeability values. In this type of multilayer structures, proteins and polysaccharides have to be first plasticized to become thermoplastic and form a continuous film, a fact that made them suitable in terms of barrier properties, for fulfilling the packaging requirements of fresh produce. However, water and oxygen permeability values of the neat thermoplastic wheat gluten or TPS films could be detrimentally altered by the presence of plasticizers and these biopolymers could be disintegrated or even dissolved at high relative humidity conditions, limiting their real application. To overcome this issue, electrospun hydrophobic coatings were incorporated as outer layers, avoiding swelling problems of the plasticized wheat gluten or starch-based film. In this regard, Fabra et al. (2016c) have observed that barrier properties of the developed multilayer systems can be tailored by using different biodegradable electrospun coatings (such as PLA, polycaprolactone, PCL, or PHA) and by modulating the thickness of the outer layers. In fact, they have found a positive linear relationship between the amount of the electrospun coatings deposited onto both sides of a thermoplastic cornstarch film and the thickness of the electrospun biopolyester coating. Interestingly, the addition of electrospun coatings led to an exponential oxygen and water vapor permeability drop as the amount of the electrospun coating increased.",

To this end, hybrid electrospun PHA fibers reinforced with highly dispersed crystalline BCNW in solutions concentrations up to 15 wt.% were directly electrospun onto both sides of starch based nanobiocomposites containing 15 wt.% BCNW.

By means of this procedure, several biopolymers with opposite charges can be used to produce nanolayered films assembled through LbL. The LbL technique is quite simple and enables using a wide range of materials (e.g., proteins, polysaccharides, lipids, and nanoparticles). These materials are able to interact either by electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, covalent bonds, complementary base pairing, or hydrophobic bonding. For instance, two polysaccharides with opposite charges, chitosan and sodium alginate, were deposited onto aminolyzed/charged PET (A/C PET) and the resulting multilayer nanofilm showed lower water vapor permeability that could be expected for the materials with which the film was built (Carneiro-da-Cunha et al., 2010). The use of the LbL technique has also been studied for the development of active coatings. In this line, Fabra et al.

In particular, antimicrobial packaging is attracting increased attention from the food and packaging industry, because the use of preservative packaging films offers several advantages compared with the direct addition of preservatives into food products (Suppakul et al., 2003). The incorporation of antimicrobial agents into polymeric films allows industry to combine the preservative functions of antimicrobials with the protective functions of the preexisting packaging concepts (Appendini and Hotchkiss, 2002). Antimicrobial activity can be achieved by including pads containing volatile antimicrobial agents into packages, incorporating antimicrobial agents directly into polymers, coating antimicrobials onto polymer surfaces, immobilizing antimicrobials by chemical grafting, or using polymers that are antimicrobial by themselves (Malhotra et al., 2015).\n",

The so obtained films led to a surprising oxygen permeability drop of ca. 56% compared to the neat polymer and had a high and prolonged bactericidal activity against two of the most common food borne pathogens, Salmonella enterica and Listeria monocytogenes (Castro-Mayorga et al., 2016a).\n",

For instance, ZnO nanoparticles showed a more effective and prolonged biocide activity against foodborne pathogens when they were applied as a coating of annealed electrospun PHA/ZnO fiber mat (Fig. 2.4A) over a compression molded PHA film (Fig. 2.4B) than their counterparts prepared by melt-mixing. This indicated that the biocide potential of metal nanoparticles could be more efficiently exploited when they were incorporated in electrospun coatings, as this processing technique improved the dispersion and distribution of the nanoparticles within the polymer matrix (Castro-Mayorga et al. 2016a).",

In addition, they also proved that these nanofibrous films were able to prolong the shelf life of strawberries and pork. Likewise, Munteanu et al. (2014) incorporated allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) and \u03b2-cyclodextrin into PVA nanofibers via electrospinning and demonstrated that the evaporation of AITC was hindered by ciclodextrin inclusion complexation and thus, their antimicrobial effect against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus was enhanced.",

Recently, the World Health Organization estimates the global burden of foodborne diseases, reporting that infectious agents that cause diarrhoeal diseases accounted for the vast majority (550 million cases per year), in particular norovirus (120 million cases per year) (WHO, 2015). In the EU, foodborne viruses were identified as the most frequently detected causative agent of foodborne outbreaks in 2014, accounting for 20.41% of the reported outbreaks (EFSA and ECDC, 2015). Moreover, the cost of foodborne illness in the USA is estimated to be around 3 billion dollars a year (Scharff, 2012).

These films showed strong antiviral activity on feline calivicirus (FCV), a norovirus surrogate, using the Japanese industrial standard (JIS Z 2801) (Mart\u00ednez-Abad et al. 2013). When films were applied to vegetables, antiviral activity was very much dependent on the food type and temperature. Likewise, Bright et al. (2009) evaluated the antiviral activity of active packaging, reporting that FCV titers were reduced by 5 log10 when in contact with plastic coupons impregnated with 10% silver\u2013copper zeolites. Moreover, the antiviral activity of adding grape seed extract (GSE), green tea extract (GTE), or cinnamaldehyde (CNMA) into films has also been reported.

Many of these novel concepts are just beginning to be explored and the interactions between the biopolymers and the active and bioactive substances and/or nanoparticles, which are key to defining the final properties need to be thoroughly studied for their rational design depending on the intended final application.
