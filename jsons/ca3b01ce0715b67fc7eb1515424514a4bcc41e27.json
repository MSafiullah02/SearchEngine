Plant-derived oral vaccines are potentially useful in combating viral infections involving mucosal immunity. Transgenic plants have been generated to successfully produce mucosal vaccines against cholera, hepatitis B, foot-and-mouth disease, and Norwalk virus. As a first step toward the generation of oral vaccines against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), we have expressed a recombinant S1 protein of the SARS-CoV in transformed tobacco. Since plant transformation and regeneration of stable transformants require considerable time, we initially used a green fluorescent protein (GFP) to tag the antigen in transient expression. GFP was fused to the carboxy-terminus of S1 for expression of S1-GFP to show expression of recombinant S1 by agroinfiltration of tobacco leaves. The GFP tag enables a relatively quick confirmation of antigen expression in plant cells by fluorescent microscopy. Such analysis using GFP that precedes stable plant transformation will enable the rapid screening of multiple constructs to attain optimal recombinant protein expression. Furthermore, this approach determines the subcellular localization of the recombinant protein in plant cells, providing information on optimal subcellular targeting for production in plant bioreactors.",

Such edible vaccines deliverable as fruits (e.g., tomato), leaves (e.g., lettuce), tubers (e.g., potato), seeds (e.g., rice or corn), stems, or roots, would obliterate purification procedures required for microbial-derived recombinant vaccines. Further added advantages include the easy storage, transport, and administration by direct ingestion of these oral vaccines. Represented in the form of plant organs (fruits, leaves, tubers, seeds, stems, or roots), these vaccines can be easily grown and distributed, omitting the need for refrigeration in delivery or the requirement for injection by trained health personnel, thereby reducing the costs of immunization programs in developing countries.",

In nature, Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a Gram-negative soil bacterium that transfers and incorporates its transfer-DNA (T-DNA) into the plant nuclear genome. This results in an expression of genes on the T-DNA that will cause crown gall in the infected plant (5) . It has been demonstrated in Agrobacteriummediated transformation that following co-cultivation of tobacco BY-2 cells with an Agrobacterium harboring a GFP fusion construct, the rate of fusion protein synthesis markedly increased between 24 and 36 h, after which rapid decrease occurred (6) . Agroinfiltration is a more recent technique that can be applied to investigate transient expression in plant cells by which an Agrobacterium liquid culture is infiltrated into intact plant leaves (7) . The feasibility of rapid analyses of foreign protein expression in transiently expressed leaves following agroinfiltration presents a major advantage in its use. The transiently expressed foreign protein is probably derived from transiently synthesized T-DNA containing the construct that had been mobilized from Agrobacterium cells to the tobacco nuclei but has yet to be integrated into the tobacco nuclear genome (8) .",

Images of transient expression of S1:GFP antigen in the cytosol of agroinfiltrated tobacco leaves are shown in Fig. 2 . Expression of the construct with GFP alone was not confined to the cytosol. Nuclear expression is seen because of the accumulation of passive diffusion of GFP into the nucleus (13) . The S1:GFP fusion was localized to the cytosol, and also to the periphery of the nucleus as well, implicating that S1:GFP was secreted through the endoplasmic reticulum network. Depending on total experimental conditions, the expression of the target gene at the infiltrated area can vary. Under optimal conditions, almost all cells at the infiltrated area show expression, like in Fig. 2 . Generally, it should not be difficult to get expression in more than 50% of plant cells at the infiltrated area. To confirm the transient expression of S1:GFP in tobacco leaves following agroinfiltration, western blot analysis was carried out using antibodies against GFP. Total proteins were extracted from tobacco leaves infiltrated with plasmid pGDG expressing GFP alone or plasmid pCV12 expressing the S1:GFP fusion. 1. Harvest plant tissues and immediately freeze in liquid nitrogen. Grind using a mortar and pestle in protein homogenizing buffer. Use about 10 mL of ice-cold homogenizing buffer per 1 g of tissue.",

In transient gene expression, the levels in expression may be age dependent and may differ in leaf tissues at varying stages of development. Generally, the highest level of transient expression is observed in tissues that contain recently expanded leaf cells. 2. Agroinfiltration can also be used in conjunction with vacuum infiltration on either detached or attached plant leaves. With the use of detached leaves, the leaves should be best incubated on wet filter paper rather than on solidified MS medium following agroinfiltration since incubation on MS often gave lower expression levels (8) . 3. The pH of the Agrobacterium resuspension can be within a range of pH 5.0-5.8. We usually use pH 5.5. The concentration of Agrobacterium cells is important for infiltration. The optimal concentration of the Agrobacterium suspension is OD 600 = 0.4-0.6. The Agrobacterium culture is grown to log phase and then resuspended to OD 600 = 0.4-0.6 for better expression. If the bacterial cells are out of log phase, the efficiency could be much decreased. 4. Acetosyringone is usually added in the agroinfiltration medium to increase the efficiency. It has been demonstrated in Chinese Cabbage that agroinfiltration can be improved by adding hydrogen peroxide (14) . Since the plasmid vector for agroinfiltration does not necessarily carry an antibiotic-resistance selectable marker gene, a smaller vector can be considered for use to enhance T-DNA transfer in plant cells by agroinfiltration. 5. Make sure there are no air bubbles between nitrocellulose membrane and gel or else certain regions will not be transferred to the membrane. Alternatively, the blot can be assembled under transfer buffer to avoid trapping bubbles.",
