Notably, being in the midst of the current flu season with a much higher prevalence of influenza in the U.S. than COVID-19, further limits the specificity of CT. Besides, the use of radiography equipment requires high disinfection needs after each use which can make massive tests laborious and timeconsuming. In practice, for hygienic reasons, chest X-rays are often frontally taken with patients on a stretcher or bed, lying down or at best sitting. Such constraints often conduct to chest X-rays with poor quality and real issues in term of analysis.",

The study aims to establish an early screening model for COVID-19 by automatically analyzing collected pulmonary CT images of COVID-19, Influenza-A viral pneumonia and healthy cases (618 transverse-section CT samples before data augmentation). The overall accuracy of the deep learning models were 86.7% for these three groups. First CT images were preprocessed for extracting effective pulmonary regions. Second, a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was used to segment multiple candidate regions (patches). In particular, the VNET [6] based segmentation model VNET-IR-RPN [7] trained for pulmonary tuberculosis purpose was used to separate candidate patches from viral pneumonia. Third, a classification model (e.g. based on ResNet [8] ) categorizes each patch amongst three types: COVID-19, Influenza-A-viral-pneumonia, and irrelevant-to-infection; and assign an infection probability. The overall analysis report for one CT sample was calculated using the Noisy-or Bayesian function.",

To accelerate the manual delineation of CT images for training, a Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) strategy is adopted. A manual delineation step is operated by a medical staff for delimiting infected regions on original COVID-19 chest CT images. This permits to generate and to enrich a training set that is given as input to an artificial intelligence engine which operates to an automatic segmentation step over the COVID-19 infected region. The process loops these steps from this autocontoured regions to assist radiologists for their annotation refinements. The proposed system yielded Dice similarity coefficients of approximately 91.6% between automatic and manual segmentations, and a mean Percentage Of Infection (POI) estimation error of 0.3% for the whole lung on the validation dataset. Moreover, compared with the cases of fully manual delineation that often requires 1 to 5 hours, the HITL strategy drastically reduces the delineation time to 4 minutes after 3 iterations of model updating.",

The authors exploit residual architecture design principles [13] pointing that they show time and again to enable reliable neural network architectures that are easier to train to high performance. They leverage generative synthesis [14] as the machine-driven design exploration strategy for generating the final COVID-Net network architecture that obtains a global test accuracy of 83.5%.

Precisely, the image is split into a set of image blocks that correspond to grid cells (see Fig. 2 ). This operation enhances the size of the training set while limiting the loss of image details. This loss often occurs when the original images are resized for fitting inputs of standard deep learning architectures. Then, each image block is given as input to the RNN for providing a set of local predictions (matrix of contamination) towards estimating health indicators such as a CNN-based infection ratio (a use is described in section III-B). The grid discretization should be tuned according to the obtained predictive performance of the considered architecture. 2) Data preparation and model inputs: For our experiments, we exploited Chest X-ray images from the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset 1 . This dataset is related to the paper [18] on the identification of medical diagnoses and treatable diseases by image-based deep learning. This dataset contains 5,863 children X-Ray images divided in two categories, namely Normal and Pneumonia.

Indeed, they have all exceeded 84% of average accuracy on pneumonia detection cases for the Pneumonia reorganized dataset 1 . Hence, a patient that has a pneumonia during the epidemic context has a high probability to be detected by these models. In particular, the Inception-ResNetV2 model has detected the minimum of false negatives to the pneumonia on the blind test set (0.7%). Moreover, we have shown in our experiments that the transfer of knowledge from pediatric chest X-ray training towards infection screening of adults can be efficient. Additionally, an attempt based on realistic scenarios is done to provide easy-to-apply health indicators for evaluating infection rate and aggravation risk to the COVID-19 pneumonia. Future works may exploit our models to discern between COVID-19 viral and non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia once chest X-ray images of COVID-19 will be accessible in sufficient quantity. This should permit to specifically identify COVID-19 infected patients even in a non-epidemic context. Furthermore, reliability of proposed models must be cross-checked by RT-PCR tests and clinical tests before deployment.
