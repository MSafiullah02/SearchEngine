After the founding of The People's Republic of China, all levels of government, from central to local, have been attaching great importance to schistosomiasis control. Such efforts have also been integrated into sustainable social and economic development planning. After more than 60 years of constant efforts in the control of schistosomiasis, the Chinese government has made remarkable achievements, which can be a learning basis for many developing countries (Xu et al., 2016a, Xu et al., 2016b). At present, schistosomiasis elimination has been identified as the new target in The People's Republic of China (Lei and Zhou, 2015).",

The control programme can be divided into four stages, namely in the early years after the founding of The People's Republic of China from 1949 to 1959, in the later 20th century from 1960s to 1980s, from the late 1980s to the end of the 20th century and the 21st century (Xu et al., 2016a, Xu et al., 2016b). At each stage, the successful experiences have been summarized into three aspects, namely national policy support and measures, resource mobilization and effect of schistosomiasis control. Such a summary provides the basis for designing an elimination programme against schistosomiasis in The People's Republic of China and be potentially used as a reference for developing schistosomiasis control programmes in other developing countries.\n",

Although the whole country was mobilized to make unremitting efforts to eliminate the disease, the work of schistosomiasis control was exceptionally arduous due to limited economic and technological conditions at that time.",

The leading group was also called the \u2018nine people group\u2019. Subsequently, leading groups were found at different levels of party committee, including in the provincial party committee, municipal party committee, county party committee and town party committee, which lead the local work of schistosomiasis control (Fig. 1\n). In addition, specific responsibilities and actions at five levels of leadership were clearly stated. Firstly, a regular meeting system was established. Secondly, a regular reporting system, which reflected the true progress and problems of schistosomiasis control was set up (Zhang et al., 2016). Thirdly, the local schistosomiasis control planning was sought to be assessed and reformulated each year. The leading group of the Central Committee of CPC performed its duties fully and consecutive national work conferences on schistosomiasis control were held thrice in Shanghai in a span of 2 years (Shi, 2011). Directives of the state council for schistosomiasis elimination were issued by Premier Zhou Enlai on 20 April 1957, and the council issued the highest level of government documents on schistosomiasis control (Wang, 2011). A notice on implementing the directives of schistosomiasis elimination was published by the Central Committee of CPC on 23 April 1957, which expressed the terms that all provincial party committees, municipal party committees of schistosomiasis endemic areas and the party groups of the relevant departments under the state council should ensure the execution of the state council's instructions. From then on, the relevant provincial communist party had to submit a report on schistosomiasis control every 6 months to the Central Committee of CPC.",

The infectious disease management law of The People's Republic of China passed in 1955 was the first health law for the management of infectious diseases issued by the highest authority of the state after the founding of The People's Republic of China. With this law, the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases were brought into the ambit of legal system management for the first time (Zhou, 2004). Initially, only scientific management system of schistosomiasis control was set up at that time in The People's Republic of China, where schistosomiasis was listed as a \u2018c\u2019 class infectious disease in the law. By setting up a proper legal management system, a comprehensive set of regulations and principles as well as prevention and treatment measures for schistosomiasis were clarified. This included the responsibilities of the citizens, social organizations and relevant government departments (Cao et al., 2016). In addition, the law reflected science and humanity as more attention was directed at protecting the individual privacy of patients with infectious diseases (Li and Shen, 2006, Yao and Xu, 2005). Furthermore, the reporting and releasing system of epidemic became more effective as witnessed in the legal infectious disease reporting system carried out in the 1950s in The People's Republic of China. Therefore, the transparency of infectious disease control was strengthened and the citizens' right to know was respected according to the above approach.\n",

Subsequently, the comprehensive measures for schistosomiasis control were put forward by the national expert advisory committee of schistosomiasis control of CPC (Shi, 2011). The prevention and control of schistosomiasis and other infectious diseases were included in the national agricultural development outline (draft), which was passed by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of CPC, in January 1956. From 1956 to 1967, infectious diseases research projects, including work on schistosomiasis, were considered important goals and formed the basis for the planning of science and technology development in The People's Republic of China.

These organizations could be divided mainly into two kinds, namely mass organizations of treatment and mass organizations of prevention, which included the snail control team, investigation team of infection rate and emergency response team, who played important roles in snail control, faeces of human and livestock management, and daily sanitation and hygiene management. For example, in order to play its role properly, Jiangsu Province integrated their treatment and prevention units with their social medical organization by establishing a joint clinic. During this period, similar mass organizations of prevention and treatment were also established in endemic provinces, so as to implement the principle of mass prevention and treatment into practice.",

There were 449 epidemic counties (cities, areas), 3563 epidemic towns, resulting in more than 11.6 million patients, 1.20 million cattle infected by schistosome, and an area coverage of 14.3 billion m2 of snail. The high epidemic areas of schistosomiasis were also located along the Yangtze River and its connected lakes, such as Dongting Lake, Poyang Lake and Tai Lake. The epidemic in other provinces, such as Yunnan, Fujian, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces, were relatively light (Chen and Feng, 1999, Tang, 2012). According to the epidemiological characteristics and snail-ridden environments, the areas endemic with schistosomiasis were divided into three types in The People's Republic of China, namely marshland, hilly and water network areas (Liu et al., 2016; Shi et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016).",

The process of schistosomiasis control was halted, leading to a serious reemergence of schistosomiasis. The leading groups and professional organizations for schistosomiasis control were dissolved at different levels, namely the national, provincial, municipal (city) and county (district) levels (Wang et al., 1989). After 1970s, the process of schistosomiasis control began to develop steadily, with a national overhaul and recovery. Some epidemic prevention institutions were rebuilt.

The Schistosomiasis Expert Advisory Committee of Ministry of Health played an important role in schistosomiasis control, by working on inventing new drugs for snail control with high efficiency, low toxicity and low price through scientific research (Cai and Zhang, 2012). The State Council issued \u201cthe national eighth five-year plan of comprehensive control of schistosomiasis\u201d in 1991, in which schistosomiasis control was accepted into the overall planning of economic and social development at different levels of government. The national eighth five-year plan of scientific research of schistosomiasis control has strengthened the scientific research of schistosomiasis control. The national health education implementation planning was made since 1992, where health education was accepted into the overall plan of schistosomiasis control. The purpose of health education was to mobilize the whole society to support schistosomiasis control, and to change the behaviour of target groups who are in close contact with infected water. The State Council issued \u2018The national ninth five-year plan of comprehensive control of schistosomiasis\u2019 in 1997, where the important position and role of science and technology in schistosomiasis control was provided with more attention by the government after 1980s.

Foreign capital and advanced technology and management were introduced to make up for the inadequacy of government investment and the lack of technical and management skills. The project was implemented from 1992 to 2001 (Collins et al., 2012). The endemic disease control department of the Ministry of Health and foreign loan office were responsible for the implementation of the project. Within the 10-year period, the total investment for the project amounted to 1.088 billion yuan, including the World Bank loan of RMB 491 million yuan and the Chinese government of different levels matching fund of RMB 597 million yuan (Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4\n). The projects covered 219 counties of 8 provinces (Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Yunnan and Sichuan). The total goals of the project were to control the epidemic of schistosomiasis and to interrupt transmission of schistosomiasis in some areas in The People's Republic of China. All project activities were planned till the end of 1998, while three provinces Hunan, Hubei and Yunnan continued till 2001 due to further demands. The project had support from the State Development Planning Commission and the Ministry of Finance, with multisectoral participation including health, agriculture, water conservancy and the state drug administration departments. During the project, there were 63,375,009 person-time with case screening, 18,925,688 person-time with chemotherapy, 1,688,428 cattle with case screening and 2,234,634 cattle with treatment. In addition, 9.64 billion m2 of area was surveyed for snails, snail elimination with molluscicide was performed on 2.85 billion m2, and snail elimination via environmental modification was conducted on 1.05 billion m2. An estimated 7.47 million people benefited from the project (Chen, 2005).",

Measures included building of embankments and returning farmland to lake. However, this change of environment has led to the proliferation of oncomelania snail\u2013infested areas (Yang et a1., 2005).2.New epidemic characteristics and regularity of schistosomiasis thus emerged due to the changes of environment. For example, after the completion of the Three Gorges Dam, the extension of the flooding period caused the infectious season to be longer in areas with snails, such as Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake. Global climate change also increased schistosomiasis transmission intensity in some areas (Zhou et al., 2002, 2008; Wu et al., 2007).3.The development of animal husbandry led to a more important role of the animal host in schistosomiasis transmission.4.Chemical molluscicide (especially for aquatic animals) caused serious pollution in the environment, limiting the scope of application of molluscicide.\n5.Compliance with long-term and repeated chemotherapy in humans and livestock dropped yearly. Infectious source increased since synchronous chemotherapy of human and livestock could not be carried out. Furthermore the only effective drug, praziquantel, had a potential risk of resistance (Wang and Liang, 2007) because of its wide-range use for a long time in the endemic areas.6.The increase in social and economic developments brought along a rise in population mobility and livestock trading. Therefore, the frequency of contact with infected water, and reinfection of human and animal increased (Zuo et al., 2003).7.Since 2000s, the society and the mass people have paid more attention to the market economy system; however, due to the change of people's ideology and behaviour, schistosomiasis control was ignored to some extent and some measures were hard to carried out at one time (Li et al., 2002, Cai et al., 2003, Yin et al., 2002).8.After the WBLP on schistosomiasis control ended in 2001, there was a serious shortage of funding, causing schistosomiasis control in the country to be more passive.9.The current technology and measures cannot satisfy the needs of the current schistosomiasis control programme, hence it was difficult to effectively control the disease.\n",

As a result, the total number of patients countrywide remains at around 800,000 from 1998 to 2005, and 700,000 of them are from the five marshland provinces. Cattle infection rate was around 4\u20135%, with an increased spread of snails. The risk of infection with schistosome was rising, with new areas of infected snails estimated to be about 9 million m2 each year in the marshland areas (Chen et al., 2011). The endemic status of schistosomiasis in The People's Republic of China showed that the task of schistosomiasis control was still urgent. The continuous rise in endemic status lasted for 3 years, increasing the risk of human and animal infected by schistosome (Chen et al., 2002, Chen et al., 2003, Xiao et al., 2004). In addition, it was difficult to reach the goal of transmission interruption through snail elimination in the marshland areas, such as Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu Provinces, as well as the hilly areas, including Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, where the snails were widely distributed, and the ecological environment were complex. Therefore, during 2000s the emphasis on schistosomiasis control is in marshland and hilly endemic areas (Cao et al., 2003).\n",

The goal and objectives of schistosomiasis control were clearly clarified in these national programs. The timeline for reaching goals and the national standards in the endemic areas in The People's Republic of China, including infection control, transmission control and interruption, was clearly stated. With the support of all departments, the central fiscal transfer payments programme was quickly implemented, thus achieving the expected results. At the same time, the management model of this project also became the best example for disease prevention and control in The People's Republic of China (Zhou et al., 2011) because of its specific goals, scientific strategies and specific measures, which took into account the vital interests of the people in endemic areas. The \u2018National Program of Schistosomiasis Comprehensive Control (2004\u201308)\u2019 was organized by multiministries and commissions in October 2004. The central government allocated special funds to carry out comprehensive control of schistosomiasis in heavy endemic areas, focussing on 163 key counties (city, district). The \u2018National Program of Schistosomiasis Comprehensive Control (2009\u201315)\u2019 was organized in 2010 and reaffirmed the overall goal of schistosomiasis control in The People's Republic of China. The \u2018National Program of Animal Disease Control for the Mid- and Long Term (2012\u201320)\u2019 was organized in 2012. In addition, suggestions for the twelfth five-year plan of the national economy and social development made by the Central Committee of the CPC were passed during the fifth plenary session of the 17th of the communist party. It was an important task to \u2018improve the system of public health and medical service\u2019 during the \u201ctwelfth five-year\u2019 period. According to the policy, a basic public health system, including schistosomiasis control, was to be provided in the future.",

Based on results from epidemiological studies and a further understanding of the characteristics and regularity of schistosomiasis in The People's Republic of China, Chinese scholars paid more attention to the two transmission stages of schistosomiasis, namely the miracidium and snail. It was considered that the waste management of human and livestock was an effective way to control infection and reinfection of schistosome (Lin et al., 2009). The comprehensive control strategy \u2018on the emphasis of infection source control\u2019 was officially announced and implemented in 2006 (Chen et al., 2009, Wang et al., 2009a, Wang et al., 2009b, Wang, 2005, Wang et al., 2009c). The central government arranged special funds for water conservancy, agriculture, health and forestry for schistosomiasis control. The comprehensive control strategy \u2018on the emphasis of infection source control\u2019 was implemented in endemic areas, through the project resources and the increased investment from the local government. The notice of \u2018further strengthening the infectious source control of schistosomiasis\u2019 was issued to the relevant provinces and the ministries by the State Council general office via an urgent telegram in October 2007. Prohibition of countermeasures to control grazing in the areas of snail habitats was extended since 2008. It was indicated that the Central Committee and the State Council were equally concerned with fighting the \u2018god of plague\u2019, flood prevention and disaster relief and people in the endemic areas were inspired to fight schistosomiasis. In addition, the research institute of parasitic disease of Chinese academy of preventive medicine was renamed to the National Institute of Parasitic Disease, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2002. The national and provincial institutes of parasitic disease made up a scientific research base, which provided guidance for the scientific research of disease control. Three levels of institute (station) of schistosomiasis control, namely municipal (city), county (district) and countryside (town) were still playing a role to organize the implementation of measures. This led to an effective implementation of the measures of the comprehensive control strategy.",

The local governments invested lots of money for it, including agricultural mechanization, safe drinking water, the use of biogas and construction of nonhazardous sanitary latrines. These funds were made up of health project funds from the central transfer payments, construction funds such as agriculture, water conservancy, forestry and land (Yang et al., 2016), as well as matching funds from central project supporting funds from the local governments and routine funds of the schistosomiasis control project. This did not only guarantee a smooth development in all the endemic provinces, municipalities (cities), counties (districts), but also improved the efficiency of schistosomiasis control under the construction of a new socialist countryside. In endemic areas of schistosomiasis, the safe drinking water problem of 6 million people were solved, 1.62 million nonhazardous sanitary latrines were built, 490,000 biogas were built, 430,000 cattle were killed, 760 thousands sets of new agricultural machinery were introduced to replaced cattle, 1183 km of the river channel revetment were constructed, 0.17 billion m2 of paddy fields were changed to dry land, 1272 km of river and lake beach were forbidden from grazing by fence, 20 billion m2 of prevention forest were built since 2011. The government of Hubei Province invested 240 million yuan to implement cattle elimination, 200,000 head of cattle were killed for 4 consecutive years from 2011 to 2014. Thus, the infectious source of livestock was controlled efficiently by lots of measures, such as promoting the whole county with comprehensive control, establishing agricultural cooperatives and carrying out the \u2018no oxen county\u2019 campaign (data source: Deputy Prime Minister Liu Yandong, speech on the National Conference of Schistosomiasis Control in 2014). Local governments at all levels worked according to the demands of \u2018building a harmonious society, constructing new countryside\u2019 and implemented comprehensive control measures, with emphasis on infectious source \u2013 timely suggested by the Ministry of Health. The process of schistosomiasis control were effectively promoted in The People's Republic of China due to the priority of the resources and strategies, methods and technology, and efforts to ensure achievement of anticipated goal (Lin et al., 2007; Yi et al., 2009a, Yi et al., 2009b; Wang et al., 2009a, Wang et al., 2009b, Wang et al., 2009c). For example, the State Council approved the implementation of the national rural drinking water safety project and solved the drinking water safety problem for 353 million rural residents and more than 24 million students and teachers from 2005 to 2012. In addition, The People's Republic of China has also allocated 18.5 billion yuan to the construction of prevention and control system for animal disease and a comprehensive schistosomiasis control (Li, 2013). The pilot counties for schistosomiasis-integrated control were set up by the State Council leading group in different endemic areas for the first time, including Jinxian County in Jiangxi Province, AnXiang County in Hunan Province, Hanchuan County in Hubei Province, Guichi County in Anhui Province and Puge County in Sichuan Province. They were the representatives of schistosomiasis-integrated control through implementation of all proposed measures (Yu et al., 2006). Subsequently, provinces also carried out the pilot work in heavy endemic counties with effective results (Zhang et al., 2009, Zhu et al., 2009, Yang et al., 2009, Yi et al., 2009a, Yi et al., 2009b).",

There were three rebound epidemics of schistosomiasis in The People's Republic of China: the first one was influenced by the cultural revolution during the 1960s, the second was influenced by the reform of market economy system during the 1980s and the third was affected by the multiple factors of the natural environment and social economy around the 20th century. The CPC and the government paid great importance to schistosomiasis control. The policy system of schistosomiasis control was formed by strengthening the leadership according to the measures of issuing a series of policy document on schistosomiasis control from central to local government, and making central planning and local specific measures. Therefore, the mode of schistosomiasis control depended on the leadership of the government, who indicated the direction of the development and laid the foundation in future. In addition, disease control and prevention was upgraded to the national polity level, where promoting disease control and prevention by political authority formed the solid foundation of schistosomiasis elimination.",

But two main problems need to be emphasized on the macrocontrol of policy in future, as follows: Firstly, it was not given enough attention to the schistosomiasis control, which is complex in nature, its economic benefits were always ignored. Therefore, there was a lack in assessment on strategy, especially on comparative assessment on economic benefit analysis of strategy and the rational allocation of resources. Secondly, the investment of schistosomiasis control was under a budgeting system responsible by the state. When the proposed measures did not work, nobody but the state had to bear the economic losses.
