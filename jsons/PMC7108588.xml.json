For instance, luteolin isolated from the flowers of Lonicera japonica can suppress inflammatory mediator release by blocking the NF-\u03baB and MAPKs activation pathways in HMC-1 cells;21Arctigenin from Fructus Forsythiae significantly decreases carrageenan-induced paw edema, arachidonic acid-induced ear edema, and acetic acid-induced writhing response and capillary permeability accentuation, respectively.22 This evidence implies that the two herbs display Janus functions, i.e., treating virus infection in a two-faced fashion: inhibiting virus, and meanwhile, stimulating host's immune system. This suggests that the combination of anti-viral and immunomodulatory agents will be more than passing interest for the anti-viral agents singly used in patients with influenza. However, despite the attractive therapy for influenza, it is still unclear what the underlying molecular mechanism of the Janus functions in the treatment of virus disease is?",

By considering drug actions and side effects in the context of the regulatory networks within which the drug targets and disease gene products function, network analysis promises to greatly increase our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the multiple actions of drugs.25 Thus the application of systems pharmacology to herbal medicine affords new possibilities for investigating the explicit targets of medicinal herbs' active ingredients and their interactions in the context of molecular networks,25 and thereby highlights the molecular mechanism of their Janus functions. In the previous work, we have developed a robust model based on systems pharmacology to evaluate the efficiency of medicinal herbs and identified a series of bioactive ingredients and possible targets from these herbs. By mapping them onto functional ontologies, the resulting biologically meaningful networks for those herbs offer a deep understanding of their action mechanisms.26,27",

We firstly explored their active compound cohorts and potential targets, and then mapped these compounds and protein targets onto functional ontologies such as the compound\u2013target associations, compound\u2013pathway connections and target\u2013disease interactions, which offered a means to infer details on the specific mechanisms of the herbs that led to the pathologic transition.

Indeed, after intestinal deglycosylation, sweroside and 7-epi-loganin can display good OBs (74% and 85%, respectively), which suggests that they play their bioactivities mainly in the form of their catabolites, and probably act as prodrugs that are metabolized to the active form.29 Similarly, some other compounds known as hederageninglycosides also show good OB and present certain bioactivities after deglycosylation. For example, the OB of loniceroside A, a glycoside with significant anti-inflammatory activity,50 increases from 23% to 89% as a result of glycosylhydrolysis.

Since the symptoms of influenza are roughly classified into respiratory tract diseases (e.g. respiratory tract infection and cough), nervous system diseases (e.g. headache), and pathological conditions, signs and symptoms (e.g., inflammation), the above result further confirms the effectiveness of the medicinal herbs for treating the influenza disease. For instance, as one of the hallmarks of influenza, acute respiratory distress syndrome is attributed to the hyperproduction of cytokines and chemokines in the lung, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8.72 These cytokines are mainly released by the macrophages enriched in lung and their production is mediated by the MAPK pathway. Thus inhibition of MAPK can lower the production of these inflammatory cytokines and thereby may have a therapeutic benefit.73 In fact, both MAPK and TNF are predicted to be targets shared by the both herbs. This result thus suggests that Lonicera japonica and Fructus Forsythiae attaches great importance to the immunity and self-adjusting functions of human beings in the treatment of influenza.",

This result suggests that Lonicera japonica and Fructus Forsythiae can directly target viral proteins. For example, neuraminidase (NA) and hemagglutinin are antigenic glycoproteins on the surface of influenza virions. Both of them recognize the carbohydrate structures and bind to the sialic acid receptor on the surface of the host cell, which aids the entry of the virus.74 Then the NA antigen cleaves the terminal linkage of the sialic acid receptor, thereby leading to the release of the progeny virions from the infected host cells. Due to the essential role of NA in influenza viral replication, spread and pathogenesis, NA and HN are considered to be attractive targets for combating influenza.75 By analyzing the T\u2013D network as described above, we suggest that the two medicinal herbs can limit the virus infection by targeting the viral protein directly.",

Although the mechanisms of actions of the herbs seem to have little in common, they are reconcilable in the treatment of influenza. After being threatened by viruses such as influenza, the innate immune system of human provides a first line of defense against pathogens. Thus many proteins in immune system, such as TLRs, MAPKs and PPARs, become attractive targets for limiting the infection with influenza virus. For instances, (1) TLRs, germline encoded pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), recognize virion glycoproteins (hemagglutinin)76 and then rapidly initiate a cascade of events that results in the expression of a variety of genes involved in the inflammatory and immune responses.77 The inhibition of TLRs pathway can effectively suppress the influenza A virus-induced upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, and viral replication.78 Similarly, euxanthone from Fructus Forsythiae, which is predicted to inhibit TLRs, also probably inactivates the influenza; (2) p38 MAPK activation has been shown to contribute to the hyperinduction of TNF-\u03b1 in response to influenza virus infection, which is a critical step in influenza virus replication. Thus it has been suggested that p38 MAPK inhibitors could be used to limit the viral replication.76 Here, we find that molecule quercetin (involved in both herbs) is able to inhibit MAPK, and thus reduce the TNF-\u03b1-induced chemokine secretion,79 verifying that both herbs have important implications for the host resistance against influenza virus infection; (3) PPARs are ligand-dependent transcription factors that regulate the gene expression.80 Their activation can dampen the proinflammatory cytokine secretion by inhibiting the activation of NF-\u03baB, thereby reducing the inflammation in response to influenza virus infection.81 Thus PPAR agonists like hyperforin82 and caffeic acid83 would hold a great promise as influenza treatments. Intriguingly, these molecules as agonist have been identified in herbs Lonicera japonica and/or Fructus Forsythiae, further highlighting the efficiency of medicinal herbs in treatment of influenza. Combined, these results indicate that both herbs can help hosts to restrain viral infection by enhancing the antiviral defenses.",

This pathway is directly related to the neurodevelopment, which utilizes the neurotransmittersglutamate, dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline as its starters and regulates certain crucial pathways that maintain mood and regulate stress such as, long-term potentiation, GnRH (Gonadotrophin Releasing Hormone) signaling and synthesis of gap junction. More importantly, the neuroactive ligand\u2013receptor interaction pathway can be activated early after virus infection.90 This result indicates that herbal medicine is a response-oriented treatment and emphasizes restoring the self-regulatory ability of the body; (2) the calcium signaling pathway also stood out in the enriched pathway list. This pathway can be modulated by small messenger molecule nitric oxide (NO) which was produced by NOS (the enzyme nitric oxide synthase).91 Hence, NO displays various potent physiological effects, including the vascular headache pathophysiology probably associated with this pathway. Furthermore, this pathway has also been demonstrated to be associated with influenza A virus-induced apoptosis;92 (3) the nucleotide metabolism pathways including \u201cpyrimidine metabolism\u201d and \u201cpurine metabolism\u201d are crucial to the survival of the virus and bacteria. The common target DHODH is an enzyme that catalyzes the rate limiting step in de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine in different cell lines,93 and its inhibition can suppress the cell growth and antibody production including the immunoglobulin production.94 Thus, these pathways including DHODH would be an attractive target for antiviral and antibacterial therapies.
