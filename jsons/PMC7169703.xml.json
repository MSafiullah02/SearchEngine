Such molecular methods are known to be highly sensitive, but have limited positive predictive value for several reasons. First, detection of CMV is very common in blood as well as in BAL samples in both symptomatic and asymptomatic LTRs 7, 8. Second, a positive NAAT made on a tissue specimen or a BAL sample may either reflect active disease or shedding 1. Third, high VLs are sometimes observed in asymptomatic transplant patients, which underline the imperfect degree of correlation between VLs and occurrence of invasive disease 9, 10, 11.",
