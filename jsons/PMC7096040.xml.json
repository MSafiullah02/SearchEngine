            "text": "Type 2 diabetes is a complex disease that presents beta cell failure in the setting of insulin resistance. At the beginning of the disease, pancreatic beta cells adapt to insulin resistance by increasing their mass and secretory function. Nevertheless, the sustained hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia eventually exert a negative impact on beta cell function and lead to impaired insulin secretion and decreased insulin gene expression, ultimately causing beta cell apoptosis [1, 2]. Moreover, the follow-up of beta cell mass in diabetic patients and in people strongly at risk for diabetes and their response to pharmacological treatment may be crucial for early diagnosis and treatment selection, making the search for beta cell mass markers a high priority for investigation [3].",

In the pancreas, TMEM27 is produced in beta cells [6, 7]. However, its biological role in this cell type remains uncertain. While one study established a potential positive role of TMEM27 in glucose-stimulated insulin exocytosis [7], another study linked TMEM27 production to beta cell proliferation [6]. The latter study also hypothesised that TMEM27, which is cleaved and shed into the extracellular space, might be used as a beta cell mass biomarker. Furthermore, adding to the controversy concerning the physiological role of TMEM27 in beta cell homeostasis, Tmem27-knockout mice exhibited both normal insulin secretion and beta cell mass and replication [8].",

In this study, we characterised TMEM27 production in human pancreatic islets, confirming that it is mainly produced in beta cells. Importantly, we report that TMEM27 expression is decreased in type 2 diabetic islets. In addition, using gene expression analysis in human and rat islets along with gain-of-function experiments in a pancreatic beta cell line and isolated islets, we provide evidence that TMEM27 is involved in the regulation of insulin secretion with little if any control of proliferation. Finally, we show that TMEM27 is cleaved not only by beta cells but also by kidney tubular cells, a finding that rules it out as a beta cell mass biomarker.",

This treatment improves insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance (ESM Fig. 2a\u2013c), lowers basal insulinaemia (Fig. 3a) and decreases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Fig. 3b). Pancreatic islets from tungstate-treated rats present a higher ratio of PCNA-positive cells (Fig. 3c), which is indicative of enhanced proliferation. Therefore, tungstate treatment elicits decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and increases islet proliferation, making these animals an interesting model for the analysis of the potential implication of TMEM27 in these two cellular functions. In islets from tungstate-treated rats, we found that, despite the increase observed in beta cell proliferation, Tmem27 mRNA levels were decreased in parallel to those of insulin, with a significant correlation between Tmem27 and insulin gene expression (Fig. 3d\u2013f), as we observed previously in human islets.\n\n",

One possible explanation for this observation was that TMEM27 was produced in different endocrine subtypes within the islets. However, immunofluorescence analysis revealed that TMEM27 production was mainly localised to beta cells in all three species (ESM Fig. 7). Next, to establish the importance of the primary sequence of TMEM27, we adenovirally expressed rat, mouse and human Tmem27/TMEM27 cDNA in rat INS-1 cells (ESM Fig. 6b). Here again, we found characteristic band patterns for each isoform, suggesting that the differences observed were more probably due to the amino acid sequence of TMEM27 than to the presence of specific modifying or processing enzymes.\n\n",

So the different orthologues appeared to exert similar effects when overexpressed in the same cellular context. Finally, in order to rule out a possible artefact from the beta cell line, we tested the effect of overexpressed rat Tmem27 in isolated rat pancreatic islets and demonstrated, as in INS-1 cells, a significant enhancement in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion with no changes in proliferation levels (Fig. 5).

For this purpose we used two different antibodies: (1) a myc tag antibody which recognises the complete protein and the C-terminal fragment that remains anchored to the membrane after cleavage; and (2) an antibody against the N-terminal of the protein [6] which recognises both the complete protein and the fragment that is released into the extracellular space after cleavage (Fig. 6a). As shown in Fig. 6b, 16 h after adenoviral infection of INS-1 cells, overproduced myc-tagged TMEM27 was detected as two different molecular mass bands with anti-myc antibodies. An additional lower molecular mass band (\u223c20 kDa) appeared 4 h later, probably corresponding to the previously described fragment of TMEM27 [6] which remains anchored to the membrane after the cleavage, as it did not change after glycosidase treatment (ESM Fig. 8a) and it has a lower apparent molecular mass than the expected size of the complete protein without modifications (27 kDa).

In addition, we detected the extracellular portion of TMEM27 (\u223c25 kDa), which has been cleaved and shed, in the culture media of uninfected and infected INS-1 and proximal tubular cells (Fig. 6d). This fragment can be deglycosylated (ESM Fig. 9), thus confirming that it corresponds to the released fragment of TMEM27 as previously described [6]. Therefore, our results show that the cleavage of TMEM27 is not beta cell specific and consequently cannot be used as a beta cell mass biomarker.",

In the same line, a recent report shows that TMEM27 expression is tenfold lower in islets from recent diagnosed type 1 diabetic pancreatic donors as compared with healthy controls [27].

For instance, Tmem27 is downregulated in models with islet hypoplasia and hypoinsulinaemia, such as Hnf-1\u03b1-knockout and transgenic mice overexpressing a human dominant-negative form of HNF-1\u03b1 (P291fsinsC-HNF-1\u03b1) [7], whereas it is upregulated in models with islet hypertrophia and hyperinsulinaemia such as ob/ob, db/db, aP2-Srebp-1c, KKAY or high-fat-diet obese mice [6, 7]. Though all these data might be interpreted as indicative of the existence of a link between Tmem27 expression and beta cell dysfunction, the truth is that the role of TMEM27 in the physiology of the pancreatic beta cell is still a matter of controversy. One study points towards its implication in insulin secretion as a component of the SNARE complex [7], while another indicates that it is mainly involved in beta cell replication [6]. Furthermore, another recent study reports that Tmem27-knockout mice do not display any prominent pancreatic phenotype [8].",

In fact, we found a significant and positive correlation with insulin and SNAPIN but not with cyclins (E1 and D1), CDK2 or CDK6, which suggests that TMEM27 expression is more directly correlated to changes in insulin secretion than to beta cell proliferation. While interpretation of these data has obvious limitations, as these studies are restricted to the key regulators of the cell cycle [28] and we cannot rule out the existence of correlations at the level of protein expression, we reached a similar conclusion when we used an experimental rat model based on tungstate treatment [10, 25]. This model offers us the possibility to assess Tmem27 expression in a scenario of increased beta cell proliferation and diminished insulin secretion, which is substantially different from the models mentioned above, in which both secretory and proliferative activities were affected in a similar manner. In tungstate-treated rats, we found downregulation of islet Tmem27 expression. Thus, altogether, our expression data in humans and rats favour a role of TMEM27 in insulin secretion rather than cell proliferation.",

Because previous studies overexpressing either mouse Tmem27 [6] or human TMEM27 [7] in insulinoma cells and transgenic mice had reached different conclusions, we wondered whether different TMEM27 isoforms were responsible for the discrepancies. In fact, our preliminary observation that rat, mouse and human TMEM27 proteins showed different band patterns in immunoblot analysis, not only in protein extracts from isolated islets but also when overproduced in INS-1 cells, provided support for the hypothesis that inter-specific variations in the post-translational modifications and/or processing of TMEM27 proteins might account for the reported differences in function. Nevertheless, our data show strikingly similar results when these three isoforms are overexpressed in INS-1 cells: a significant enhancement in glucose-induced insulin secretion with a very modest increase in proliferation, which was not reflected in measurable increases in cell number. Likewise, overproduction of the rat isoform in isolated rat islets resulted in modifications in insulin secretion but not in proliferation rates.",
