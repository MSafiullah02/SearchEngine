Thus, a key risk factor for infection transmission should be the rate of hand contact with these areas termed target facial membranes. A study was conducted in which 10 subjects were each videotaped for 3 hr while performing office-type work in isolation from other persons. The number of contacts to the eyes, nostrils, and lips was scored during subsequent viewing of the tapes. The total contacts per subject had sample meanx = 47 and sample standard deviation s = 34. The average total contact rate per hour was 15.7. The authors developed a relatively simple algebraic model for estimating the dose of pathogens transferred to target facial membranes during a defined exposure period. The model considers the rate of pathogen transfer to the hands via contact with contaminated environmental surfaces, and the rate of pathogen loss from the hands due to pathogen die-off and transfer from the hands to environmental surfaces and to target facial membranes during touching. The estimation of infection risk due to this dose also is discussed. A hypothetical but plausible example involving influenza A virus transmission is presented to illustrate the model.",

Aside from rhinovirus infection, which has been shown to occur following contact of the nasal and conjunctival mucosa with fingertips seeded with virus, (1) the evidence for the hand contact route is indirect albeit substantial. Intervention studies conducted in senior daycare facilities, (2) student dormitories, (3) military barracks, (4) and households (5) have shown that increased handwashing and/or hand treatment with an iodine solution decreased respiratory tract illnesses by 20% or more relative to the incidence in control groups. A meta-analysis of eight selected intervention studies geared toward the general public showed a 24% decrease in respiratory illness relative to control groups due to handwashing measures. (6) Given these overall findings, recent pandemic influenza planning documents identify hand contact as a potential exposure route, (7) even though this pathway never has been experimentally demonstrated for seasonal influenza A virus.",

Other risk factors include the rate of hand contact with environmental surfaces, the degree of contamination of the touched surfaces, the transfer efficiency on touching, and the infectivity (virulence) of the pathogen. A reasonable qualitative statement is that infection risk increases as the rate of hand contact with target facial membranes increases. However, a more quantitative description is desirable. Because there are sparse published data concerning the rate of hand contact with target facial membranes, the authors conducted a limited observational study of that rate. The authors also developed a mathematical framework that uses hand contact rate information to estimate the pathogen dose to target facial membranes and relates this dose to infection risk.",

Each subject was paid a small amount for participating. Subsequent to the 10 sessions, the same investigator (DB) viewed the tapes and counted the number of times each subject touched his/her eyes, nostrils, and lips. Descriptive statistics (the sample mean and standard deviation) were computed for the touch frequencies. Spearman rank correlation coefficients were computed for the three pairwise combinations of touch frequencies (lips-eyes, lips-nostrils, eyes-nostrils), and tests of the hypothesis that the rank correlation coefficients exceeded zero were performed.

For the total counts per subject, the sample meanx = 47, the sample standard deviation s = 35, and the sample range is 3 to 104. The average total contact rate per hour is 15.7 (the average total frequency divided by 3). There is substantial interindividual variability in total hand contact rates with target facial membranes, as reflected by the 35-fold difference in the range limits (104 \u00f7 3) and by the 73% coefficient of variation, equal to 100% \u00d7 (35 \u00f7 47). There is also a positive intra-subject correlation between the number of hand contacts with lips and eyes and with lips and nostrils, which is to say that those who touch their lips frequently tend to touch their eyes and nostrils frequently. The Spearman rank correlation coefficients for contacts between different facial target sites are as follows: (i) 0.76 for the lips and eyes; (ii) 0.66 for the lips and nostrils; and (iii) 0.44 for the eyes and nostrils. Given the conventional hypothesis test error of alpha equal 0.05, the lips-eyes correlation coefficient of 0.76 is significantly greater than zero (one-sided p-value = 0.011), the lips-nostrils correlation coefficient of 0.66 is significantly greater than zero (one-sided p-value = 0.024), but the eyes-nostrils correlation coefficient of 0.44 is not significantly greater than zero (one-sided p-value = 0.093).",

For example, depending on the pathogen, \u03b1 might be much greater for deposition in the pulmonary region than for deposition in the pharyngeal region due to the density of receptor sites or host defense mechanisms. Evidence for such sitespecific differences would be the observation that to achieve infection of 50% of test subjects (or animals), inhalation of far fewer pathogens is required if the pathogens are carried on respirable particles compared with inspirable but nonrespirable particles. This circumstance must be considered because few if any pathogens deposited on target facial membranes will penetrate into the respiratory tract past the epiglottis; thus, using an \u03b1 estimate based on a respirable pathogen inhalation study may be inappropriate. A better study for estimating \u03b1 for a pathogen received by the hand contact route would involve instillation of the pathogen directly onto oro-and nasopharyngeal membranes.",

Therefore, perhaps the most appropriate study of infectivity for a pathogen received by the hand contact route would involve seeding the pathogen onto a target facial membrane, because infection response would inherently account for the fraction transported to oro-and nasopharyngeal target sites and for the \u03b1 value at those sites. The estimated \u03b1 value from such a study could be used in the equation: R = 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03b1 \u00d7 D total ), where D total is the expected total dose to the target facial membranes.",

At the same time, the model incorporates factors that logically should influence pathogen transfer to target facial membranes, and identifies key information needs. In brief, quantitative data are needed concerning value ranges for: (i) pathogen concentrations on room surfaces; (ii) the rate of contact with potentially contaminated room surfaces; (iii) transfer efficiencies upon contact; and (iv) pathogen die-off rates on the hands. Information on pathogen die-off rates on environmental surfaces has recently been reviewed by Boone and Gerba. (9) With respect to infection risk, the authors do not assert that Eq. 12 is the single best risk model for all pathogens, although it is a reasonable construct to apply when the doseresponse data are sparse. An equally important issue is the value of the transport efficiency parameter \u03b5. It is plausible that \u03b5 could be close to zero or close to one depending on the tissue receptor sites for the pathogen and the target facial membrane. For example, if pathogen tissue receptors were primarily in the nasopharynx above the soft palate, it seems likely that few if any pathogens deposited on the lips would reach those receptors. On the other hand, if the tissue receptors were primarily in the oropharynx below the soft palate, perhaps the great majority of pathogens deposited on the lips would reach receptor sites.",
