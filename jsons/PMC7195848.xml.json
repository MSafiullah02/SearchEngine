However, the use of the term \u201celective\u201d has fallen victim to scrutiny, with notable room for subjective interpretation among surgeons. When considering which surgeries to delay and which ones to prioritize, there are several factors to consider. For clarification, it is important to understand that an orthopaedic surgery can be classified as urgent inpatient (intertrochanteric femur fracture), urgent outpatient (flexor digitorum profundus rupture), elective inpatient, and elective outpatient. The orthopaedic department leadership needs to determine what are the prioritized objectives about demand for hospital beds, PPE inventory, and other limited resources including intravenous (IV) fluids, ventilators, and personnel.5 Targeted reduction on surgeries can be performed for a variety of reasons. Some hospitals may have the objective to vacate inpatient beds. In this scenario, it is important to classify surgeries based on whether they can be performed as outpatient versus inpatient. As such, elective surgeries requiring inpatient admission may be postponed, whereas elective cases that can be accomplished as outpatient are permitted.4 When admission is required, valuable resources such as beds, nursing, and supplies are necessary, and their limited stock is depleted. These resources can, instead, be preserved by decreasing elective orthopaedic surgery requiring inpatient admission. If the main concern is shortage of ventilators and anesthesia staff, consideration may be made toward moving urgent outpatient surgery to a local ambulatory surgery center (ASC) to decrease utilization of these resources at the inpatient hospital.6",

This experience in Singapore with the current COVID-19 crisis has already been documented. Chang Liang et al4 reported that their department postponed or canceled all nonurgent procedures that needed an inpatient admission. This mainly affected spine surgery, elective pediatric cases, and hip and knee arthroplasty. Other surgeons may use the length of stay (LOS) as a metric to determine which procedures should be performed during this difficult time because longer hospital stays may exhaust more coveted resources and may place patients at increased risk of nosocomial infection.",

The authors reported that sport, hand, and some spine procedures typically have less than 1 day stay, whereas arthroplasty ranged from 2.2 to 3.4 days. The authors also identified which comorbidities are associated with increased LOS. They found that increased age, diabetes, general anesthesia, morbid obesity, COPD, poor nutrition, congestive heart failure, non-Caucasian race, and hypertension were correlated with increased LOS. Current times have shown that individuals with more comorbidities are more predisposed to worse clinical outcomes from the coronavirus.8 Surgeons may use data such as this to objectively decide which cases are and are not appropriate surgeries, given local resources and pandemic status. In addition, surgeons should optimize modifiable risk factors preoperatively and manage them postoperatively in an effort to decrease LOS.7 Orthopaedic surgeons, as always, should make sure that preoperative diabetes mellitus is controlled as best as possible. Additional consideration should be given to use regional anesthesia if possible, consulting a nutritionist and internal medicine consultation for assistance with other preoperative comorbidities.7",

However, choosing which surgeries to postpone is not easily determined without some controversy. Some recommendations may be to postpone all surgeries that can be delayed more than 1 month. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services advises that a surgery can be delayed if it will not cause harm to the patient and they recommend creating a tiered framework for prioritization.9 We have categorized major orthopaedic surgeries by how long they can safely be delayed according to the previous studies (Table 1). Deciding which surgeries to cancel may not be as simple as a binary decision (elective versus nonelective). Depending on the phase of the disease locally, orthopaedic programs may move into more of an emergency surgery situation and then move toward allowing elective surgery, then move back into an emergency surgery only situation again. This could occur with quiescent phases, followed by new outbreaks. This second phase phenomenon occurred in Canada with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), whereby a second wave of infection followed the initial recovery.10",

The American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine has posted a video giving guidance for athletes who have had their elective surgery postponed.37 The AAOS has released a statement that guidelines should be based on resources including personnel, intensive care unit (ICU) beds, PPE, and respirators.38 They have also recommended a panel including the chief of the ICU, chief of orthopaedic surgery, chief of anesthesia, and head of the hospital to review possible surgeries. The AAOS has also supported guidelines from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the ACS. The ACS has released orthopaedic guidelines stating that during phase 2 (curtail elective) and phase 3 (eliminate elective), many surgeries should still be performed. They list joint dislocations, quad and patella tendon ruptures, aggressive tumors, impending fractures, lacerated tendons, and many fractures as surgeries that should still be performed. They also list surgeries for carpal tunnel syndrome and tendinitis as ones that can wait.39 The American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons has released general guidelines that patients' waiting for surgery can be managed with other modalities.40",

At the time of this publication, there are no established guidelines for preoperative screening for COVID-19. As tests becomes more rapid and accessible than at the infancy of the pandemic, preoperative screening can certainly become a reality. Currently, the international community has turned to already afflicted countries such as China and Italy for guidance. Guo et al42 recommend to have patients tested for COVID-19 before surgery if available and to plac a mask on patients at all times. Another study from several hospitals in China evaluated 34 elective orthopaedic surgery patients who were in the incubation period of COVID-19. These patients unintentionally had surgery without anyone knowing they were infected with COVID-19 before surgery. A large portion of these patients had major complications with a 20.5% mortality and 44.1% rate of ICU admission postoperatively.43 The main utility for identification of patients with COVID-19 before orthopaedic surgery would be to avoid these complications and protect medical staff further.44 A paucity in the literature is the reflection of the swift spread of this virus with no clear consensus. Below is a compilation of current recommendations acquired from multiple sources internationally that can be implemented as continued improvements to testing are made:(1) All patients and staff are required to wear masks during perioperative contact as if all patients could be positive for COVID-19.41,42(2) All but emergent surgical patients should be tested preoperatively for COVID-19 as local resources allow (dependent on facility, Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Diagnostic Panels, can provide results in 4 to 6 hours).42,44,45(3) Air-purifying respirators (PAPR) for all surgical staff for all patients with COVID-19 + or N95 if none are available.46",

Varia et al53 found that with the SARS outbreak of 2003, the risk of acquiring the droplet-spread virus correlated with the distance to the patient. In addition, inside patient rooms that require contact precautions, not only are the patients contagious but also the medical equipment and accommodations within the room can also become niduses for infection.54 A novel way of decreasing this traffic can be the creation of an auxiliary space for medical supplies such as IV poles and associated fluids and medications, which can be accessed physically outside of a patient's room. We have developed a system which decreases PPE usage and exposure to medical staff, as seen in Figure 3. Many of these monitors and fluid management systems are traditionally adjacent to the bedside, requiring nursing staff and physicians to come in close proximity to the patient when they need to be used. In these situations, this can potentiate the spread of highly contagious pathogens from one patient to another when a healthcare personnel needs to perform activities such as changing IV fluids or medications right next to the patient and possibly acquiring the disease inadvertently. The traffic can be avoided, and the contamination of other inanimate objects within a room can be minimized if these fluids and monitors are stationed physically outside the patient's room instead.",

The previous SARS epidemic, although not as intensely experienced by the United States, left an impact on China and Canada which can be learned from.64-66 Healthcare workers involved in the epidemic showed over 90% anxiety or depression symptoms during the outbreak or after. Many had residual symptoms even after the disease had retreated. Reasons for the psychologic symptoms included:(1) Isolation: Social distancing isolated people from their normal support network. This includes fellow colleagues to discuss and process the current events and normal social activities which people used to relax for work stresses, such as going to a brewery to grab a beer with friends. It gets even worse if you are the unfortunate individual to contract the disease. If you are hospitalized, you will be confined alone within a room, often hours before seeing anyone else because of people trying to limit exposure.(2) Stigmatization: There is a lot of fear surrounding the epidemic. Fear of patients can affect the delivery of care. Fear of having the disease can incite people to congest the testing centers. It can also do the opposite in which individuals may downplay symptoms. This second issue could be a particular issue for orthopaedic providers. Healthcare providers my downplay symptoms in an effort to continue to care for patients.(3) Guilt: As a healthcare worker, it is not an uncommon battle to balance work and home life. Not only are we risking exposure to ourselves at work every day but also bringing home a certain amount of risk to our families. Our team has taken families into consideration by education about changing clothes and showering before coming in contact and inquiring about families' well-being. This not only helps decrease the amount of exposure but again enhances a sense of community.(4) Helplessness: Even persons not involved in direct care of infected populations feel the psychologic impact. There has been a push for \u201cnonessential\u201d personnel to be sent home. There is concern that this label implies that a person is not as important as they truly are. The continuation of roles at home gives nonessential individuals something purposeful to do and keep up a normal routine. Change in role, where an individual becomes essential, may be more beneficial. The retrospective evaluation by Maunder et al.67 showed that people who were recalled from home into an altered role showed more \u201cpsychologic satisfaction.\u201d",

We have curtailed in-person meetings but have, instead, transitioned to videoconferences with staff and residents to continue to disseminate information and attempt to continue group educational activities to encourage some normalcy of everyday activities.(2) Created shift work or altered roles: As many of our elective services are shut down, surgeons, residents, and ancillary are repurposed to other areas. We have specifically created three resident teams. This leaves one team on the inpatient service at all times (our higher risk exposure group), one team maintaining lower volume, lesser risk services (such as mostly elective services that have reduced volume), and a reserve service (at home, educational and research focused). The staff also have rotations where the inpatient trauma staff rotate to allow coverage if individuals become ill and limit their exposure to the higher risk inpatient setting. In addition, the staff who is not working in the inpatient setting remains isolated in the outpatient setting with a transition to increased use of telemedicine and assistance with administrative duties and supporting the continuation of practices. This continues to allow individuals to work and will create periods of less high-risk exposure for less transmission to self and families. This also increases time for self-care.(3) Self-care focus. Shift work increases time to catch up on sleep. Our normal conferences typically occurred at 6 am, but our videoconferences were shifted to 4 pm to allow people more time to sleep. Staff has recommended good nutrition and exercise, with increased time to allow providers to accomplish both.",
