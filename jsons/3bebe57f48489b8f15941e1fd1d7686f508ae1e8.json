In the case of pneumonia, the basic defining features include a radiographic infiltrate, systemic signs of infection (e.g., fever), and pulmonary symptoms of infection (e.g., productive cough, SOB, and occasionally pleuritic chest pain) [4] . Unfortunately, in practice, these historical features may be insufficient and potentially misleading as they may manifest in completely different disease processes, many of which do not require antibiotics. These include decompensated heart failure (SOB), pulmonary embolism (pleuritic chest pain), COPD exacerbation (SOB and cough), and even allergic rhinitis (fatigue, malaise, productive cough). Furthermore, studies have shown that history has poor interobserver reliability in the ability to record symptoms in patients with suspected pneumonia. For instance, the classic amalgam of fever, cough, tachycardia, and crackles has a sensitivity of less than 50% for the diagnosis of acute pneumonia, and no other constellation of historical and physical findings has performed better [5] .",

This approach includes obtaining a careful clinical history and physical exam, sputum and blood cultures, and chest X-ray ity, however, belies its relatively dismal diagnostic performance. This was starkly illustrated by a landmark study in 2015, which showed that in more than 60% of the cases, no bacterial or viral organism could be identified [6] . Equally poor results are seen in patients with ventilatorassociated pneumonia, in whom only 50% of pathogens are identified [7] .

Excitingly, novel ways to diagnose pneumonia are rapidly emerging, with some already folded into practice. This section will cover these newer techniques, which run the technological gamut from protein biomarkers to whole genome sequencing and proteomic profiling. Table 12 .1 for Summary) An important component of the diagnostic armamentarium in pneumonia is a family of assays aimed at detecting bacterial antigens in bodily fluids (e.g., serum and urine). This approach is Commercially available [13, 15, 19, 27] Mass spectrometry for proteomic profiling (continued) already in widespread practice given its relatively low cost, high specificity, rapid processing times, and ready accessibility to samples. The principal disadvantage derives from the indirect detection of pathogen through an antigen rather than isolation of the organism, which is necessary for assessing antibiotic susceptibility [11, 12] . A common example is the assay for S. pneumoniae urinary antigen (the C-polysaccharide), which has a sensitivity and specificity of 72% and 96%, respectively, in patients with non-bacteremic pneumonia. Importantly, initiation of antibiotics does not impair test characteristics, as antigens remaining positive for at least 3 days after receiving appropriate therapy [13] . Another example is the urine immunoassay for detecting Legionella pneu-mophilia serogroup 1, which causes between 50% and 70% of Legionella infections. This test has 80% sensitivity and greater than 99% specificity [14] .",

There are numerous commercial multiplex PCR systems currently in use to diagnose pneumonia-mostly viral infection from nasopharyngeal sampling, but some bacterial pathogens as well. A downside to multiplex PCR is the potential for primer-primer interactions, which can interfere with amplification and decrease the sensitivity of the test; bead-array and microarrays are used to combat this issue [15] . A second issue is the risk of false positivity, which can stem either from the exquisite sensitivity of the test or from coincidental detection of organisms that are potentially pathogenic, but not producing disease in a given patient. Multiplex PCR has changed our basic understanding of what causes pneumonia; in a landmark trial by the EPIC team, among more than 2000 patients with radiographic evidence of pneumonia, the majority of cases with a confirmed microbiological etiology were viral, and the most frequent pathogen was rhinovirus, accounting for 9% of cases [6, 16] . It should be noted, however, that the sampling site in this study was the nasopharynx, and therefore the recovered virus may simply represent a bystander and not the pathogen responsible for the lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Further complicating the interpretation of viral studies is that 15% of healthy individuals carry a respiratory tract pathogen at any given time [16] .",

Specifically, the gene encodes for penicillin-binding protein 2a, which has a decreased affinity for beta-lactam antibiotics that renders almost the entire drug class obsolete, with the exception of late-generation cephalosporins [19, 20] . Multiple iterations of tests aimed at identifying MRSA have culminated in an effective multiplex assay that recognizes four pertinent genes in only 2-6 hours [21] . These include the SCCmec-orfX junction (which indicates the Staphylococcus genus), spa (which specifies S. aureus), mecA (the resistance gene), and mecC (a mecA homolog).

Additionally, WGS can offer basic insight into the dysbiosis that often accompanies lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This is exemplified by a study examining rhinovirus-induced exacerbation, which demonstrated a significant rise in the overall bacterial burden [47] .",

Interestingly, it is especially elevated in cases of Legionella infection compared with other biomarkers [53] . Given its widespread availability, it has been validated as a point-of-care (POC) lab test to guide antibiotic use in primary care [54] , and levels have been correlated to disease severity and complications in community-acquired pneumonia [55] .

To address these questions, Schuetz et al. conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis, including studies across a variety of clinical settings including primary care, emergency departments, and the ICU.

While the most common tests are those tested in the serum, sputum and airway fluid (BAL, non-bronchoscopic BAL, tracheal aspirates) should also be evaluated. A study of BAL fluid from 47 patients found that median WBC count and neutrophil percentages were significantly higher in bacterial than viral pneumonia. Furthermore, BAL WBC count was an independent predictor of bacterial pneumonia, and when combined with procalcitonin or CRP, the composite reached a sensitivity of 95.8% and a specificity of 95.7% [106] . Importantly, the utility of BAL leukocytosis extends to immunocompromised patients as well, as demonstrated by a study of 107 patients with either hematological malignancy or solid organ transplant. This showed that BAL fluid neutrophil percentage had the highest AUC to predict bacterial infection; in contrast, neither the presence of infiltrates nor leukocyte count was helpful in diagnosing bacterial infection [107] .",

WGS is performed on a sputum sample and reveals influenza B infection with no bacterial superinfection. Antibiotics are withheld, and he initially improves on neuraminidase inhibitor therapy. However, 5 days later he has recurring fevers and worsening hypoxia. Analysis of his exhaled volatile compounds reveals a profile consistent with S. aureus pneumonia; mass spectrometry analysis of a sputum sample rapidly confirms S. aureus infection and further identifies mecA, indicating MRSA. Vancomycin is promptly added, and the team considers transferring him to a higher level Using bacterial pneumonia as an example, pathogens access alveoli and trigger immune responses through the elaboration of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which activate pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) and production of inflammatory cytokines. Pathogens also damage lung tissue directly, in some cases leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In general, procalcitonin is secreted during bacterial and not viral infections. Bacterial lung infections can also result in systemic inflammation characterized by acute phase response and production of C-reactive protein (CRP), fever, multiorgan failure, vasoplegia, and vascular permeability that presents as sepsis of care for closer monitoring. However, his pro-ANP and MR-pro-ADM are not elevated, and onsite transcriptomic analysis of peripheral leukocytes does not show an SRS1 pattern, reassuring the team that he is not a high risk for decompensating. He is safely sent to the general medicine floor, continues to improve, and is discharged home after his short hospitalization.",

For instance, the costs associated with many of these tests are prohibitive, especially in smaller medical centers. Therefore, technological improvements will be necessary to decrease operating costs while clinical studies must be performed to identify those patients best suited for such advanced and more expensive diagnostics. Basic and translational studies are also needed to more fully elucidate the pathophysiology and natural history of pneumonia to inform future clinical studies and further explain existing data. Ultimately, a multidisciplinary approach involving clinical research, basic biology, chemical analysis, assay optimization, and computational science are needed to usher in an era where the potentially transformative technologies described above are used routinely in the diagnosis and management of pneumonia.",
