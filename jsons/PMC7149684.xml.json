Infection with these viruses is the cause of sporadic and sometimes serious outbreaks that may lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Transmission of the viruses to humans may occur as a result of cross-species spread from animals, such as swines or birds in the case of influenza virus A. Spread of the viruses between individuals is usually as a result of inhalation of virus-containing droplets or through contact with contaminated objects. Efficient transmission makes control of the infections difficult to achieve, especially when containment of outbreaks has been delayed. Spread of respiratory viruses may be rapid in areas of dense population or when an infected individual has direct close contact with many people. This was the case at the initiation of the outbreak of the pandemic caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) during 2002/2003 [1], [2]. A health-care worker who treated infected individuals was in turn responsible for wider spread of the virus to people of the Gaundong province of China.",

            "text": "Hypermutability of the viruses leads to significant changes in their properties, and sometimes new viral strains emerge that have serious pathological effects. High rates of mutation may also account for ability of the viruses to spread from one species to another. Variability in viral gene sequences and their expression further complicates management by thwarting development of effective vaccines and treatments. Therefore, the availability of expertise that may be rapidly and rationally deployed to counter epidemics of respiratory viral infections would be valuable, and gene therapy provides resources for such purposes. Because the viruses that cause respiratory infections have genomes that comprise RNA, gene silencing and antisense approaches have been favored to disable viral replication. Delivery of antiviral nucleic acids to the infected tissues is facilitated by the anatomy of the pulmonary system. Intranasal and intratracheal administration of the therapeutics may conveniently be used to distribute candidate drugs to infected cells. Significant progress has now been made with use of nucleic acids to treat viral infections, and gene therapy is well positioned for advancement to clinical use in the treatment of respiratory viral infections.\n",

The first study performed on a cell culture model of RSV infection demonstrated successful inhibition of viral replication by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that targeted P and F sequences (Figure 9.1) [14]. A follow-up investigation confirmed efficacy in vivo when using mice to simulate human RSV infection [15]. The siRNAs were effective when administered as naked nucleic acids and when formulated with a transfection reagent. Markers of viral replication were suppressed, and indicators of bronchoconstriction were diminished without evidence for nonspecific activation of the interferon response. Another study reported on effective inhibition of RSV replication in mice after administration of NS1-targeting expression cassettes that were administered intranasally within chitosan-containing nanoparticles [16] (Chapter 5). Antiviral efficacy was accompanied by diminished inflammation and reactivity of the airways.\n",

            "text": "Evidence indicates that the RNAi pathway serves as an antiviral mechanism of host cells against influenza virus A [39], [40]. However, the virus may counter the antiviral effects of host gene silencing through effects of the NS1 protein [41], although this effect has been disputed [28], and the effect of NS1 appears to vary depending on the strain of virus [42]. Despite the possible inhibitory effect of influenza virus A on RNAi, several studies have shown that gene silencing is effective against influenza virus A. In 2003, Ge and colleagues reported on inhibition of viral gene expression when using synthetic siRNAs [43]. Several different sites were targeted, and the greatest efficacy was shown with siRNAs with cognates within the PB1, PA, and NP regions (Figure 9.3). Efficacy was demonstrated when Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were transfected with the siRNAs before infection with isolates of influenza virus A. Good inhibition of viral replication was also observed after infection of embryonated chicken eggs. An interesting observation was that the siRNAs were particularly effective against the cRNA/mRNA sequences, with little effects against the negative stranded genomic segments. The specificity for particular viral RNA strands may result from bias occurring during the processing of the duplex siRNA. In addition, presence of the cRNA/mRNA in the cytoplasm or diminished access of the NP-protected genomic segments to the RNAi machinery may contribute to strand selectivity. Li et al. recently confirmed that the PB1 sequence is a good target site for inhibition of influenza virus A replication when using an expressed RNAi activator (PB1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA)) [44]. A follow-up study of Ge and colleagues evaluated efficacy of siRNAs in virus-infected mice [29]. siRNAs were complexed to polyethyline imine and intravenously administered. A significant antiviral effect was observed when the gene silencers were administered before exposure and when siRNAs were given after the viral infection was established in the mice. The same study showed that expressed RNAi activators were also active against viral replication in cultured cells when they were delivered with recombinant lentiviral vectors. Use of lentiviral vectors to deliver influenza virus A-targeting shRNAs was described in other studies [30], [45]. Silencing of M1/M2 sequences effectively inhibited replication of the virus in MDCK cells. There was no evidence of escape mutants emerging after long-term suppression [45]. In addition, the gene silencing was effective against both H1N1 and avian H5N1 strains of the virus.",

The antiviral sequences were active against different viral isolates and protected mice from lethal challenge with highly pathogenic strains of influenza virus A. Suppression of viral replication in cultured cells and in mice was also demonstrated in a study that described use of siRNAs that targeted the PA sequence of the virus [47]. A particular siRNA, ps-PA496, provided protection against the virus. Suzuki and colleagues used bicistronic expression cassettes to target NP sequences of influenza A and influenza B viruses [48]. Inhibition of replication of both viruses was demonstrated in cultured cells. The cassettes were also effective when using recombinant baculovirus vectors. M2 and NP sequences were targeted by Zhou and colleagues in a study performed on MDCK cells and in mice [49]. Effective suppression of H1N1, H5N1, and H9N2 isolates was demonstrated. Activation of the innate immune response by duplex RNA has also been investigated as a means of inhibiting influenza virus A. Stewart et al. showed that positioning the 5\u2032 UGUGU 3\u2032 sequence at the 5\u2032 end of the sense strand of a siRNA targeting PB1 (PB1-2257) augmented antiviral efficacy [50]. Although this is an interesting approach, and utility has been verified in cultured cells, avoiding inadvertent unintended effects in vivo may be more difficult to achieve.",

            "text": "Because there is no effective treatment for SARS-CoV infection, and there is no good vaccine, harnessing gene therapy to counter the infection was a logical line of investigation. Swift detailed characterization of the SARS-CoV genome enabled rapid development of potentially therapeutic anti SARS-CoV RNAi activators (Figure 9.5). Although none of the investigations progressed to clinical trial, proof of principle was demonstrated using various cell culture models that simulated the human infection [63], [64], [65]. In addition, the speed with which candidate nucleic acid therapeutics were identified reinforced the notion that rational design using gene therapy may be a powerful means of rapidly advancing treatment for emerging pathogens. Wang and colleagues initially reported on the use of expression cassettes that generated six antiviral RNAi activators that targeted various sites within the genome [63]. The lead antivirals, pSR02 and pSR03, had cognates in the ORF 1b sequence (Figure 9.5). Inhibition of viral replication and attenuation of the cytopathic effects were demonstrated in cultured Vero cells derived from African green monkeys. A subsequent study, also performed on Vero cells, demonstrated efficacy of synthetic siRNAs against the virus [64]. Particularly good inhibition of viral replication was demonstrated by siRNAs targeting the S sequence. The S gene was also shown to be a good target for inhibiting SARS-CoV in cultured cells by expressed RNAi activators [65]. The most advanced study that used RNAi against SARS-CoV assessed efficacy of synthetic siRNAs against SARS-CoV in nonhuman primates [66], [67]. RNAi activators with cognates in the ORF 1b and S regions of the viral genome were developed as the candidate drugs. The short duplexes had dTdT overhangs at their 3\u2032 ends but were otherwise unmodified. Initial assessment in a murine model of the infection was followed by evaluation in Rhesus macaques. The siRNAs, administered in a dextrose solution, were given intranasally and took advantage of the anatomy of the respiratory airways to distribute the siRNAs to SARS-CoV-infected cells. The treatment effectively inhibited replication of SARS-CoV and alleviated pathogenesis of virus-related disease.",

However, despite this success, an important lesson from the outbreak has been that CoVs have the potential to be serious pathogens [1], [68]. The ability of the viruses to adapt and achieve cross-species infections is particularly concerning, and there may be further serious outbreaks of infections caused by viruses of the Coronaviridae family. Indeed, emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which is also caused by a CoV, supports this notion [69]. Problems related to infection with the MERS virus have not been as widespread and severe as those caused by SARS-CoV. Nevertheless, vigilance and advancing technology that would be able to deal with such an event is important. Insights gained from using RNAi against SARS-CoV have been valuable and will be useful to advance treatment of respiratory coronaviral infections.",

Harnessing RNAi has been a popular strategy to inhibit expression of viral genes and to silence host dependency factors that the viruses require for their replication (reviewed in ref. [72]). An example is with the development of RNAi-based treatment of measles virus infections. Despite widespread vaccination programs that effectively prevent infection with the virus, disease related to transmission of measles virus remains an important global problem. The modest efficacy of available drugs, such as ribavirin, has prompted investigation of gene therapy to treat the infection. Synthetic and expressed RNAi activators that target viral mRNA containing the L sequences, which are responsible for encoding the essential viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, have been used to inhibit viral replication in cultured cells [70]. The effect was observed without evidence of toxicity. A more recent investigation verified that good silencing of viral replication could be achieved with gene silencers that had cognates in other viral sequences [73]. The measles virus receptor (signaling lymphocyte activation molecule) [74] and Rab9 GTPase [71], [73], essential host factors required for replication of the virus, have also been effectively silenced to counter measles virus replication. In addition, viral genes and host factor-encoding genes have been silenced together in an attempt to augment antiviral efficacy [73]. Although these approaches have demonstrated impressive results that show potential for therapeutic application, feasibility of implementing gene therapy for measles virus infection is likely to be faced with several challenges. Moreover, the availability of an effective vaccine and the acute nature of measles virus infection suggest that gene therapy is not a priority for treating the disease.",

Because presentation with pathognomonic signs and symptoms is unusual, molecular diagnosis and immunoassays play an important role in diagnosis. In settings where resources are limited, this may retard identification of the etiological agent that is responsible for the clinical presentation. To compound problems of delays in diagnosis, infection with respiratory viruses usually occurs rapidly after contact with respiratory secretions of infected individuals. Transmission may occur between individuals and in some cases as a result of interspecies infection. Moreover, respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus A, readily mutate their genomes to generate viruses that have new properties of disease pathogenesis. In addition, vaccines and available therapies for respiratory viral infections often only have modest efficacy. Collectively, the potential severity of respiratory viral infections coupled to risks for emergence of new strains of particularly pathogenic strains pose public health challenges.",

As with gene therapy for other viral infections, delivery of antiviral nucleic acids is challenging. However, in the case of respiratory viral infections, the anatomical structure of the airways may be exploited for administration of the therapeutic nucleic acids. Inhalation of solutions or formulations containing the candidate drugs is convenient to distribute the nucleic acids along the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli. This approach has been used in clinical trials for the treatment of RSV infection [17], [18], and the results have been useful in informing the broader development of gene therapy for infection with respiratory viruses.
