Furthermore, it is well known that patients enrolled into clinical trials have a better outcome due to better treatment options and best clinical practice procedures. In the ethical and medical decision process, there are two heavy weights on the scale: on one hand, the therapeutic benefits we want to provide for our patients, especially if other treatment strategies are not available or not clinically competing; on the other hand, there is the significant risk of infection that these fragile patients are subjected to. In addition, many oncological treatments, experimental or not, expose patients to immunosuppression, which is a risk factor for worse outcomes from COVID-19 [5]. The decision to stop patients\u2019 enrollment is another of the worrisome consequences of the spread of COVID-19 since it narrows the therapeutic strategies at our disposal. Hospitals are putting in place all containment measures possible, such as dedicated wards in the hospital for COVID-19 patients, personal protective equipment for patients and healthcare workers, limitation of patients\u2019 relatives\u2019 hospital access.",
