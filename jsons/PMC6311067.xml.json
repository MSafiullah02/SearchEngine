Less common manifestations include frank arthritis, cough, abdominal pain, conjunctival injection and diarrhea [1]. Various neurological manifestations including confusion, hallucinations, tinnitus, hearing impairment and rarely coma are also seen [3]. The characteristic skin rash is present only in about 40% of patients. Typically, the rash is maculopapular with predominant involvement of limbs including palms and soles. In severe cases fern leaf type skin necrosis can occur. The typical eschar is rare to be found and often the patients are unaware of of tick bites [1, 4]. On rare occasions patients present with fever and multiple organ dysfunction making it difficult for the clinician to find the exact diagnosis since many tropical diseases can cause a similar picture. Indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA) is the reference serology method for the diagnosis. It is available in only a few laboratories in Sri Lanka. Limited availability of IFA has led to underreporting of the cases with rickettsial infections. MSF is usually a mild disease with a mortality rate around 2.5%. Elderly patients are prone to get more complications [5]. Mortality data regarding Sri Lankan patients are not available, except few fatal case reports.",

The possibility of ARDS was considered based on clinical, blood gas and radiological evidence. Spotted fever was considered to be the most likely diagnosis because of the presence of the typical rash. Other differential diagnoses included leptospirosis with myocarditis and pneumonitis. But the rash and lack of liver and renal involvement was not in favor of leptospirosis. Streptococcal and Staphylococcal toxic shock syndromes and meningococcal sepsis were also taken into consideration, but inability to fulfill diagnostic criteria and persistently negative cultures were against them. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is also known to complicate many zoonoses including spotter fever infections [6, 7]. However, absence of cytopenias and the splenomegaly made it less likely and further screening tests for HLH were not performed.",

In Sri Lanka myocarditis is an occasional complication in dengue infection and leptospirosis [11]. It is not a diagnosis entertained in rickettsial infections despite its high prevalence. In myocarditis, patients usually develop undue tiredness, chest discomfort and dyspnoea which may progress to cardiogenic shock or development of arrhythmias. Most often it is diagnosed clinically with ECG abnormalities such as T wave inversions, bundle branch blocks and presence or rhythm abnormalities. Echocardiography and elevation of cardiac biomarkers can be used to diagnose myocarditis but these become evident mostly in severe cases. In the background of sepsis, transient cardiac dysfunction can occur due to sepsis induced cardiomyopathy. Differentiation between the two diagnoses can only be achieved by endomyocardial biopsy. However, in acutely ill patients it is not justifiable do biopsy as it does not alter the management. Further, in the available literature suggests that rickettsial infections related cardiac dysfunction is more likely to be due to myocarditis [8, 9, 12]. Newer methods including cardiac MRI and segmented inversion recovery gradient-echocardiography pulse sequences have a better sensitivity in diagnosing acute myocarditis [13, 14]. Our patient had compatible symptoms and signs with global hypokinesia in 2D Echocardiogram and elevated troponin and NTproBNP values to suggest the presence of myocarditis.",

But presence of prolonged severe hypoxia and persistent alveolar-interstitial shadows despite treatment with intravenous diuretics was more in favor of ARDS in our patient than pure pulmonary oedema. Management of myocarditis and acute heart failure follow standard guidelines with diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers. Place of steroid in acute myocarditis is debatable but it is commonly used by clinicians on empirical evidence and personal experience. European guideline on management of myocarditis recommends immunosuppression only in chronic virus negative myocarditis and inflammatory and autoimmune myocarditis [15]. None of the 6 reported patients with MSF and myocarditis had received steroids. However, we believe that steroids helped in treating our patient.",

However, chloramphenicol which is a second line agent, is also widely used in many institutions in Sri Lanka. There are not many studies comparing the efficacy of chloramphenicol with other agents due to risk of major hematological adverse effects. In fact, CDC case report data suggest that patients with Rocky mountain spotted fever treated with chloramphenicol are at higher risk for death than persons who received a tetracycline [16]. In contrast to that our experience suggests that in severe spotted fever rickettsial infections, parenteral chloramphenicol can be used safely with good results like in this patient. Out of the 6 reported cases of MSF with myocarditis, chloramphenicol was included in treatment regimens of two patients [9]. Limitations of the our report includes the unavailability of histological evidence of myocarditis and not identifying the species due to lack of resources. Finally, this case highlights the need of prompt clinical diagnosis and treatment of spotted fever which can present with atypical features.",
