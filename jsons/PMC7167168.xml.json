HRVs and EVs are related closely to Picornaviruses and cannot be differentiated by this assay. Further identification of genus, species, and type was performed by sequencing of the VP4/VP2 genomic region, as described previously [Henquell et al., 2012]. After proteinase K (20 mg/mL) pre\u2010treatment, total nucleic acids were extracted from 400 \u00b5L of clinical sample using the NucliSENS\u00ae easyMAG\u2122 extraction automated system (Arg\u00e8ne\u2010bioM\u00e9rieux, Craponne, France) and eluted in 100 \u00b5L.

KL\u20106 is classified as cluster 9 (Mucine 1\u2010MUC1) of lung tumor proteins [Ishikawa et al., 2012]. These proteins are expressed predominantly on alveolar type II cells, respiratory bronchiolar epithelial cells, and bronchiolar gland serous cells. High serum KL\u20106 levels are associated with alveolar\u2013epithelial barrier dysfunction as they have been shown to correlate with indices of alveolar\u2013capillary permeability [Nathani et al., 2008]. The measurement of serum KL\u20106 levels is now a widely accepted diagnostic test in Japan to monitor the activity of interstitial lung disease [Kobayashi and Kitamura, 1995; Kawase et al., 2011; Kondo et al., 2011] and seems to be a useful tool in monitoring interstitial disease in European populations [Horimasu et al., 2012]. A few reports of serum KL\u20106 measurements in chronic lung disease in newborns [Ogihara et al., 2000, 2006; Kim et al., 2008] or in children [Kobayashi et al., 2001] have appeared in pediatric journals with standard upper limit concentration in a group of children with non\u2010respiratory disease [Imai et al., 2002]. It would seem therefore that some degree of alveolar damage must be present in cases with elevated serum concentrations of KL\u20106 in bronchiolitis. This alveola damage can be explained by an increase in alveolar pressure or by alveolar hyperinflation.",

            "text": "However, the results presented here suggest that acute viral bronchiolitis in previously healthy children is correlated with their immune system and inflammatory reaction to viral aggression rather than with epithelial injury. In support of this, a recent study in a small sample of hospitalized patients showed that innate immune response is inversely correlated with disease severity in children with acute RSV or HRV lower respiratory tract infection [Garcia et al., 2012]. RSV infection of respiratory epithelial cells enhances neutrophil epithelial adhesion and activation and increases the cleavage and detachment of epithelium infected with the virus [Wang et al., 1998]. RSV infection of airway epithelium in an in vitro model was found to be non\u2010destructive and non\u2010invasive [Collins and Melero, 2011]. Rhinoviruses can infect cultures of human tracheal or bronchiolar epithelial cells, tracheal submucosal gland cells, and alveolar epithelial cells by binding to the InterCellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM\u20101) and low density lipoprotein receptors and producing pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines [Jartti and Korppi, 2011; Kennedy et al., 2012].",

            "text": "Only a few published histopathology studies of acute RSV diseases are available, but it would seem that symptoms are caused by small airway obstruction by plugs composed of mucus, fibrin, and cellular debris from leukocytes and dead bronchial epithelial cells. Peri\u2010bronchiolar infiltrate is composed of morphonuclear cells [Bern et al., 2011]. Alveolar epithelial injury is clearly more present for RSV\u2010associated interstitial pneumonia. This suggests that the mechanisms that lead to respiratory failure are more related to bronchiolar obstruction and the host's immune response to the virus than they are to interstitial dysfunction, although this can be present in cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome or underlying alveolar disease, such as chronic heart disease. Polymorphonuclear neutrophil products have been shown to play an important role in the inflammatory response to RSV infection [Abu\u2010Harb et al., 1999], correlated to the severity of the first acute episode of bronchiolitis in a study with a small sample size [Marguet et al., 2009]. These results suggest that cytokines play a key role and partly mediate the respiratory tract inflammation elicited during the acute infection. Eosinophil degranulation products may also play a role in the pathogenesis of RSV bronchiolitis [Harrison et al., 1999; Kim et al., 2010], and have been found to be involved in RV\u2010induced asthma exacerbations in many in vitro models [Papadopoulos et al., 2001; Tsuji et al., 2005]. Viral infection may induce eosinophil chemoattractants to be released form airway epithelial cells, such as eotaxin or interleukine\u20108 (IL\u20108), particularly in atopic individuals [Papadopoulos et al., 2001]. Eosinophil activation, which involves the release of eosinophil granul proteins (eosinophil\u2010derived neurotoxin and eosinophil cationic protein), cysteinyl leukotrienes and cytolines, may lead to airway damage. The assessment of levels of cytokine products, particularly IL\u20108, in the nasopharyngeal aspirates of atopic and non\u2010atopic patients could yield further significant findings. Studies on the release of KL\u20106 and other markers of cell injury, oxidative stress molecules and cytokines in the respiratory tract would lead to a better understanding of the complex interaction between the host and the etiologic viral agent of bronchiolitis [Kratzer et al., 2012]. It would also be interesting to investigate the risk of developing recurrent wheezing and asthma according to the causative virus, the release of various cytokines and atopic status in a future work.",

Conversely, the results of the present study are consistent with those of a French study which observed that a dual RSV/RV infection had no additional effect on the severity of bronchiolitis [Marguet et al., 2009].",

The need for supplemental oxygen, with or without intravenous fluids, has the greatest influence by the far on the severity\u2010of\u2010disease ranking and is a reliable predictor of the duration of hospital stay [Wainwright et al., 2003; Corneli et al., [Link]].

Secondly, only a few patients required PICU hospitalization and mechanical ventilation. However, in a previous study performed in Japan in 2009 [Kawasaki et al., 2009], only seven cases required artificial respiration. Thus, the discrepancy observed between the results is not fully explained. It may have been due to differences in the inclusion criteria in the Japanese study, which probably allowed the inclusion of far more subjects with interstitial disease, that is, children with underlying congenital heart disease. The mechanism of epithelial injury is likely to be different in cases of acute bronchiolitis in infants without underlying disease. Another limitation is that we did not perform a bacteriological analysis of lower airways secretions which could have introduced bias, since a high incidence of pulmonary bacterial co\u2010infection with severe RSV bronchiolitis has been documented elsewhere [Thorburn et al., 2006]. However, the patient population studied by Thorburn et al. was different because they only included severe cases requiring mechanical ventilation, with all the samples obtained by aspirates through the endotracheal tube. Obtaining aspirates from lower airway secretions is an invasive procedure and cannot be performed with good quality results in children who are not intubated. Moreover, a more recent study performed in a large hospital\u2010based cohort concluded that serious bacterial infection appeared to occur infrequently in children hospitalized for RSV or non\u2010RSV bronchiolitis [Garcia et al., 2010].",
