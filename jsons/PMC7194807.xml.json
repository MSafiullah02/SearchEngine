            "text": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) maintains the homeostasis of blood pressure and the balance of fluid and salts [1]. The homeostasis of RAS is critical for the physiological and pathological regulation in various organs, including the heart, kidneys, and lungs [1]. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a potent negative regulator of RAS, which is critical for maintaining the homeostasis of RAS [2,3]. The human ACE2 gene is located on chromosome Xp22 and includes 18 exons. Functioning as a typical zinc metallopeptidase, ACE2 protein, which contains 805 amino acids, is a type I integral membrane glycoprotein containing a single catalytic domain [3]. In RAS, ACE2 degrades Angiotensin (Ang) II, which is potent in vasoconstriction, pro-inflammation, and pro-fibrosis, and converts it into Ang (1-7) which is vasodialatic, anti-proliferative and apoptotic [3]. Besides the systemic effect in blood pressure regulation, ACE2 has local regulatory effects in the pathological changes in several organs, including the heart, kidneys, and lungs [2]. ACE2 also regulates the amino acid absorption in the kidney and the gut and modulates the expression of transporters for amino acid [2]. ACE2 was identified as the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which could rapidly cause acute lung failure in humans [4]. Hence ACE2 is vital for the viral entry to the host cells during SARS-CoV infection.",

            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as declared by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020 [5] has accumulated over one million confirmed cases globally as of the early April 2020 [6]. Epidemiological study revealed that COVID-19 infected people of all ages [8]. The elderly and co-morbid patients are at higher risk of having poor clinical outcomes and prognosis [8,9]. High-throughput sequencing identified the pathogen of COVID-19 as a novel betacoronavirus [10], which was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [11]. Comparing to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is more infective for causing more than 120 times of infections globally (1,051,635 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of 4 April 2020 [6] vs. 8096 SARS patients [12]) but seems to be less virulent because only parts of the patients showed similar severity as SARS-CoV infection [8]. Also, the global case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 5.4 % (56,985/1,051,635, according to the data on 4 April 2020 [6]), which was lower than that of SARS-CoV infection (9.6 %, 774/8096) [12]. Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 mainly transmits through respiratory droplets and direct contact according to the reported cases [8,13]. Also, the entry of SARS-CoV-2 to the host cells requires binding with the receptor via the S-spike on the surface of the virus [10]. Computational modeling [10,14] and viral infection experiments using HeLa cells that express ACE2 protein from humans, Chinese horseshoe bats, civets, pigs, and mice [15] provided evidence that ACE2 is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Results in the Cryo-EM experiments demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 had a ten times higher affinity to ACE2 comparing to SARS-CoV, which was consistent with the higher efficiency of infection of SARS-CoV-2 [16]. These findings indicated that ACE2 might be crucial for the human infection of SARS-CoV-2 and for the progression and prognosis of COVID-19. Understanding the expression and activity of ACE2 under different physiological and pathological conditions may help to predict the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 in different cohorts of people and the clinical outcomes and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. In the present review, we will summarize the regulation and function of ACE2 in different physiological and pathological states and discuss the potential implication in SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced COVID-19.",

Therefore, the distribution and abundance of ACE2 in organs may be closely related to the clinical symptoms of COVID-19. It is known that ACE2 is enriched in the heart, kidneys, and testes, and is also broadly distributed in the lungs, liver, intestine, and brain [2]. The lung is the primary target organ of SARS-CoV-2 infection [8,9,17]. Most of the hospitalized patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 developed pneumonia, which was typically characterized as ground-glass opacity and bilateral patchy shadowing in chest computed tomography [8,17]. Pathological examination on the biopsy samples obtained from a deceased COVID-19 patient revealed diffused alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs [18]. An analysis of the single-cell RNA sequencing data obtained from 43,134 human lung cells revealed that 0.64 % of cells in lungs expressed ACE2 and 83 % of ACE2 was expressed on type II apical surface of epithelial cells (AT2) [19]. Other types of cells, including type I apical epithelial cells, airway epithelial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages, also express ACE2 at lower levels than AT2 [19]. These results indicated that AT2 is likely to be the primary target of SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs [19].",

Rectal swabs, stool, urine, and saliva sampled from some COVID-19 patients were positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus [8]. These findings demonstrated the broad distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in humans, whose pattern was similar to the distribution of ACE2. An analysis on the single-cell RNA sequencing data from human organs revealed that cells that express ACE2 included 7.5 % of cardiomyocyte, 4 % of proximal tubular epithelial cells, 2.4 % of bladder urothelial cells, 30 % of ileum epithelial cells, 1 % of esophageal epithelial cell, and 2 % of respiratory tract epithelial cells [20]. SARS-CoV-2 may attack these cells after binding with ACE2. The tissue damage and inflammation may cause severe complications that may worsen the clinical outcomes. Moreover, positive detection of the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in the samples of gastrointestinal tissues and stool from COVID-19 patients suggested that fecal-oral transmission might be possible [21]. It is noteworthy that the placental villi and the uterus also express ACE2 [22,23], indicating the possibility of vertical maternal-fetal transmission. Current reports on clinical observations indicated that this transmission route is possible [[24], [25], [26]] but may be low risk [27,28].",

The ACE2 mRNA expression in the uterus of pregnant rats was significantly higher than the one in the unpregnant rats [23], indicating the implication of progesterone in the regulation of ACE2 expression [31]. Similar up-regulation of ACE2 expression was also found in the kidneys of pregnant rats [32].

Among the critically ill COVID-19 patients, the non-survivors (64.6 years) were older than the survivors (51.9 years) [9]. These data indicated that aging might be correlated with the pathological progression and poor prognosis of COVID-19. Results obtained from the genetic knockout mice model demonstrated that ACE2 depletion caused physiological early aging independent of Ang (1-7), indicating the regulatory role of ACE2 in aging [33]. ACE2 expression in the lungs may decrease during aging according to the results in aged rats [34]. In humans, the ACE2 activity did not differ from the young and aged males but showed significant difference in the young and aged females [29,30]. This finding indicated that the effect of aging in ACE2 activity might have a gender difference [29,30]. In a study that included 220 healthy Chinese volunteers, young Chinese females showed significantly higher ACE2 activity than aged females [30]. However, the activity of ACE2 in women during aging is controversial, as a Spanish group reported lower ACE2 activity in the young females comparing to the aged females [29]. Such controversy may due to sample number-induced deviation or race, which requires further validation and investigation.",

The ACE2 content in the blood of healthy male volunteers was decreased by long term smoking experience [37]. The effect of cigarette smoking may attribute to nicotine, which could suppress the activity of the ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor axis and upregulate the ACE/Ang II/Ang II type 1 receptor [38]. The decreased ACE2 level is accompanied by the imbalance of ACE/ACE2 and hence the disturbance in RAS homeostasis. Animal experiments have demonstrated that downregulation of ACE2 contributes to the pathogenesis of cigarette smoking-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) [39].",

High salt diet increased activity of ACE2 in the urine in mice, while low salt intake decreased it [40]. The activity of ACE2 in the urine may reflect the ACE2 in the kidneys [40]. Indeed, it has been found that high salt diet increased the ACE/ACE2 ratio in the glomeruli which resulted in renal dysfunction via inducing oxidative stress [41]. ACE2 was also implicated in the hypertension whose pathogenesis was closely correlated with high salt intake. High salt intake increased the prevalence of hypertension in human with ACE2 rs2285666 TT and rs714205 GG genes [42]. In the spontaneous hypertension rat model, high salt diet profoundly worsened the symptoms of hypertension and impaired kidneys via decreasing ACE2 [43]. High glucose diet could also up-regulate ACE and down-regulate ACE2, leading to the imbalance of ACE/ACE2 in the heart [44]. Strikingly, the effect of diet could affect the offspring. Animal experiments using high salt diet-fed pregnant sheep revealed that the suppress effect of high salt diet on ACE2 may affect the embryo and last post natal [45]. Western diet could decrease the methylation of Ace2 gene in the kidneys and brain stem of perinatal mice and resulted in autonomic dysfunctions in the male offspring [46]. These findings collectively demonstrated the impact of diet on ACE2 may be involved in the pathogenesis of several chronic diseases and may even affect the offspring.",

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the most severe complications in COVID-19 patients, with the severity rate ranged from 73 % to 92 % [8,17,47]. ACE2 has well-established protective effects in the lungs [2]. ACE2 polymorphism was correlated with the severity of ARDS [2]. Ace2 knockout mice showed severe ARDS-like injury pathology in the lungs comparing to the wild type controls [48]. These symptoms can be alleviated by treatment of catalytically active, but not enzymatically inactive, recombinant ACE2 (rACE2) protein [48]. Moreover, ACE2 was also protective of SARS-infection induced acute lung disease [49]. The expression of ACE2 in the lungs of mice infected with SARS-CoV was greatly reduced, which aggravated the lung failure [49]. These results convincingly proved that ACE2 is protective against lung injury and may be a therapeutic target for ARDS shown in COVID-19.",

Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were at higher risk of progressing into severe cases when having coronal heart disease as comorbidity [8,17]. Acute cardiac injury is one of the most common complications found in COVID-19 patients [17,47]. According to a retrospective study published in the Lancet that included 41 COVID-19 patients, 12 % developed acute cardiac injury, 80 % of these cases were diagnosed as severe cases [47]. Therefore, coronal heart disease in the COVID-19 patients was closely watched both as baseline comorbidity and as complications. The pathogenesis and progression of cardiac injury were one of the preliminary factors that determined the clinical outcomes and prognosis of COVID-19 patients [17,47]. The cardiac injury found in COVID-19 patients may be at least partially attributed to the fluctuation of ACE2. In the rat model of myocardial infarction, the infarcted and peri-infarcted regions showed increased ACE2 expression comparing to surviving myocardial tissue after three days of infarction [61]. After 28 days of infarction, the surviving tissue also showed elevated ACE2 expression comparing to normal control [61]. The up-regulation of ACE2 in the heart after myocardial infarction may be triggered by a compensatory protective mechanism [62]. However, in the lungs of patients with PAH, the ACE2 expression and phosphorylation were drastically decreased [57]. Therefore, the pulmonary function of COVID-19 may progressively deteriorate upon the occurrence of cardiac complications.",

The occurrence of acute kidney injury as a complication of COVID-19 was 7 % in 41 cases reported in the Lancet, and all of them developed into severe cases [47]. In a cohort of 1099 COVID-19 patients, the occurrence of acute kidney injury was 0.5 %, and the severity rate was 83.3 % [8]. In a consecutive cohort study that included 701 COVID-19 patients, renal dysfunction characterized as elevation in serum creatine, blood urea nitrogen, the appearance of proteinuria or hematuria showed a significantly higher risk of mortality compared with normal renal function [63]. Renal dysfunction was an independent risk factor of mortality in hospitalized patients [63].

ACE2 knockout could worsen renal dysfunction modeled in ischemia/reperfusion [64] and aggravate the fibrotic pathologies in obstructive renal diseases [66].

The diabetic mice model infected with an adenovirus expressing human ACE2 showed an increase in the production of insulin and a reduction in cellular apoptosis in the pancreatic islet [68]. Moreover, ACE2 could improve the endothelial function in the pancreatic islet microvascular unit [69]. These findings demonstrated that ACE2 prevented pancreatic dysfunction in diabetes. ACE2 was implicated in the diabetic nephrology. In the human kidneys with diabetic nephropathy, ACE2 was profoundly suppressed while ACE was increased [70].

            "text": "ACE2 is currently under intensive investigation as it is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 pandemic. We summarized the increasingly emerging findings in the COVID-19 and discussed the potential role of ACE2 in the pathogenesis, progression, and prognosis of COVID-19. The susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 in different cohorts seemed to correlate with the ACE2 level. The distribution of target organs that are susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2 infection and complications of COVID-19 is similar to the one of ACE2. The three functions of ACE2, which are a peptidase that negatively modulates RAS, a regulator for the amino acid transport in the kidneys, and a receptor for the virus, including SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, together with the local protective effect on the tissue injury, are implicated in the progression and prognosis of COVID-19. These findings indicated that targeting ACE2 by using hrsACE2 or ACE2 activator may be a potential therapeutic strategy for COVID-19. Prescription of drugs that may affect ACE2, such as ACEI and ARB, in COVID-19 patients requires close observation of the blood pressure and the progression of COVID-19.",
