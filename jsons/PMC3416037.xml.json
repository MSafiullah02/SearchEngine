HKU1 (7) is a group 2 CoV, most closely related to human CoV OC43 (8), and is distinguished from group 1 CoVs 229E and NL63 (9) and from SARS CoV, which is distantly related to group 2 CoVs (10, 11). There are 3 known genotypes of CoV HKU1 (A, B, and C). Genotypes A and B were more prevalent than C in studies in Australia (12) and Italy (13), while a retrospective study of respiratory specimens in the US described similar prevalence rates (14). Other studies suggest that this virus is distributed worldwide, although the reported number of cases remains very limited (10).",

            "text": "Four lower respiratory syndromes potentially caused by human CoVs have been described: community\u2010acquired pneumonia, acute tracheobronchitis, acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and acute asthma exacerbation (6). CoV HKU1 usually causes relatively mild community\u2010acquired infections in children, characterized by rhinorrhea, cough, and fever (12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18); infection can result in bronchiolitis and pneumonia; occasionally, hypoxia and abnormal chest x\u2010rays are described (12, 14). CoV HKU1 has also been related to a high incidence of febrile seizures (15). Another study implies that CoV HKU1 could be associated with enteric symptoms (5). Pneumonia related to CoV HKU1 infection occurs mostly in older people with underlying diseases, in particular severe respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and in transplant recipients, although the virus was not identified in lung tissue in these prior studies (16). Two fatal cases of CoV HKU1\u2010associated community\u2010acquired pneumonia were reported, in which virus was detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates by RT\u2010PCR (16). Both patients had lymphopenia and were suffering from diabetes mellitus; 1 patient was 66 years old and had gastric lymphoma, while the other was 72 years old and had prostate carcinoma. Our patient received a lymphodepleting conditioning regimen for autologous HSCT, which results in prolonged T and B cell lymphopenia, and she was severely immunocompromised from both her HSCT and from the immunosuppressive therapy used to treat possible lupus pneumonitis.",

While inhaled zanamivir may have reduced the sensitivity of culture, immunohistochemistry would be expected to show evidence of influenza infection if the virus were a significant cause of disease in this patient (19) Although influenza virus infection may have been a contributor to the patient's symptoms early after HSCT, the continued progression of bronchopneumonia while on antivirals for influenza, along with failure to identify influenza in the lower respiratory tract in any clinical sample after the initial positive BALs at weeks 14 and 17 after transplantation, or at autopsy, strongly suggested that influenza was not the cause of her fatal illness. Highly immunocompromised patients are known to shed influenza in the upper respiratory tract for months (20) and the influenza virus in the BAL fluids may have been due to shedding of virus from the upper respiratory tract.",

Our patient was in the intermediate period after transplant (days 30\u2013100), which is the median time for onset of IPS (between 21 and 87 days post transplant) (21). IPS is typically described after allogeneic HSCT in which the level of immunosuppression is usually more profound than after standard autologous HSCT. The reported frequency of IPS ranges between 2% and 17%, averaging about 10% (21). CoV and other respiratory viruses may be responsible for some cases of IPS, if reliable means of detection are not employed. An increasing arsenal of diagnostic tools for detection of respiratory viruses is developing, including rapid antigen detection, monoclonal antibody testing, cell culture, and various nucleic acid amplification techniques. However, detection of some respiratory viruses including CoVs remains a challenge.",

This universal virus detection tool can provide sequence information of the pathogen present in a given sample without any prior information about the genome. DOP\u2010PCR is unbiased and has a detection limit that is close to that of nucleic acid testing techniques that use virus\u2010specific primers (1). Subtractive techniques that might be used in order to identify a pathogen require an uninfected but otherwise genetically identical control, which may be difficult to obtain for clinical samples. We previously showed that the detection limit of the DOP\u2010PCR is several orders of magnitude more sensitive than that of other generic detection techniques (1). Isolation of nucleic acids from purified nucleocapsids in the DOP\u2010PCR protocol is more likely to detect intact infectious particles than PCR of the whole sample, which has large amounts of contaminating cellular nucleic acids. DOP\u2010PCR, in which viral nucleic acid sequences are highly enriched before PCR is performed, may be especially useful for finding pathogens that cannot be readily identified by standard methods. Nonetheless, results from non\u2010specific screening techniques like the DOP\u2010PCR must be independently verified, as exemplified by the detection by DOP\u2010PCR of non\u2010viral sequences in the autopsy specimen.",

Although there may have been other co\u2010factors, CoV HKU1 infection likely contributed to this patient's fatal outcome. The patient shed influenza virus from the respiratory tract for several months, and this virus was thought to be a cause of pneumonia during much of her hospital course after transplantation. When influenza infection was considered less likely, and lupus pneumonitis was considered a possibility, she received immunosuppressive therapy that may have exacerbated her CoV HKU1 infection. While we cannot rule out the possibility that the transient improvements observed after increases in immunosuppressive therapy were due to reduction in the inflammatory response to CoV HKU1 infection, this case illustrates the importance of obtaining appropriate specimens from patients with unexplained pneumonitis and the value of unbiased approaches such as the universal virus detection assay employed here to identify other causes of pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxemia.",
