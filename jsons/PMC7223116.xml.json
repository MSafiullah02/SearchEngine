SCFAs have important biological functions in humans, such as immune modulation, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumorigenic and antimicrobial effects and enhancement of gut integrity.7 They are thought to play a key role in microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain crosstalk.8 In infants, SCFAs are the by-products of fermentation of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) by the anaerobic bacteria in the colon. HMOs are not digested by the small intestine of infants and hence they reach the colon intact, where they are utilized as nutrition by bacteria such as Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides. Since not all bacteria have the necessary enzymes to utilize HMOs, these milk glycans facilitate the establishment of a highly specialized microbial ecosystem dominated by Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides among others, while indirectly limiting growth of other bacteria.9 It is possible that neonates with CGISCs have insufficient amounts of anaerobes such as Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides, which in turn could result in decreased utilization of HMOs, and hence lower amounts of SCFAs in the colon. Given the importance of SCFAs in human health and the interplay between gut microbiota and SCFAs,7 we investigated stool SCFA levels in these infants.",

Controls were healthy term newborn infants (\u226536 weeks). We chose to include infants born at 36 weeks also instead of the conventional definition of 37 weeks because many infants with surgical conditions are born at 36 weeks and would not have been eligible for inclusion, thereby resulting in difficulty in achieving the sample size. Preterm infants <36 weeks were excluded to avoid the confounding effect of prematurity, which itself is a significant risk factor for gut dysbiosis. Even though congenital diaphragmatic hernia is not truly a gastrointestinal (GI) condition, we decided to include it because the intestines are not in the abdominal cavity throughout pregnancy in this condition.",

All reads with an expected error of more than 2 and more than 1 ambiguous base were removed. All sequences of all samples were concatenated in a single file and subsequently dereplicated to form unique sequences. Unique sequences were clustered into zero-radius operational taxonomic units (zOTUs, also called ASVs) using the UNOISE3 algorithm implemented in USEARCH. Chimeras were removed de novo during clustering and in reference mode using the UCHIME2 algorithm together with the SILVA SSURef NR99 v132. Processed, concatenated sequences were mapped on the final set of zOTUs to determine their occurrence and abundance in each sample using the otu_tab command with an identity cut-off of 97% and termination options disabled, which means that every sequence is searched against every zOTU to find the best hit.

First, 1 g of the faecal sample was suspended in 5 mL of 1% phosphoric acid and frozen at \u221220 \u00b0C immediately after collection. Once thawed, the faecal suspensions were homogenized with vortex. Then, 100 \u03bcL of 10% meta-phosphoric acid solution was added to 0.5 mL baby faecal sample to adjust the pH to about 2.0. Samples were vortexed for about 10 min and centrifuged for 30 min at 20,817 \u00d7 g, 4 \u00b0C to solidify the precipitate. After that, 0.5 mL of aqueous supernatant was transferred into a new tube; 4-methyl valeric acid was added as internal standard (IS) to a final concentration of 500 \u03bcM. Then, 250 \u03bcL of ethyl acetate was added to extract SCFAs with a vortex for about 30 min and centrifuged for 20 min at 20,817 \u00d7 g; lastly, 50 \u03bcL volume of organic extracts were transferred into GC glass vial for GC-MS analysis. One microliter of organic extracts was injected into GC-MS system (Agilent Technologies 7890B-5977B) equipped with a HP-FFAP capillary column (30 m \u00d7 0.250 mm \u00d7 0.25 \u03bcm; Agilent). Helium was used as the carrier gas at 1 mL/min. Split ratio is 30:1. The oven temperature was initially held for 1 min at 80 \u00b0C, then increased to 120 \u00b0C at 20 \u00b0C/min, and finally to 210 \u00b0C at 6.13 \u00b0C/min and held for 2 min The temperature of the injector, ion source, quadrupole, and interface were 250, 230, 150, and 280 \u00b0C respectively. The SCFA data analyses were performed in duplicate. Identification of the SCFAs was based on the retention time of standard compounds and with the assistance of the NIST 17 library. Quantifications were carried out in selected ion monitoring acquisition mode in MassHunter Acquisition software with base peak ion selected as quantifier for each compound. The calibration graphs were constructed in MassHunter Quantitative software (version B.09.00) by plotting the relative response (ratio of peak area SCFAs/peak area IS) vs. relative concentration for each individual SCFAs. The final SCFA concentrations were expressed as microgram per gram wet weight faecal sample. Since the data were not of normal distribution, Wilcoxon\u2019s rank analysis was performed to compare SCFA concentrations between the two groups (CGISCs and HIs).",

These early colonizers gradually create a reduced, anaerobic environment within the GI tract by consuming the available oxygen, consequently facilitating the establishment of obligate anaerobes such as Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides.",

SCFAs result in reduction in the luminal pH in the gut, which inhibits pathogenic microorganisms.28 Acetate produced by Bifidobacteria and other commensals improves intestinal defence mediated by epithelial cells and thereby protects the host against lethal infections by enteropathogens. Butyrate is an important fuel of intestinal epithelial cells and stimulates the mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling pathway in intestinal cells, which is positively correlated with gut defences.29 Butyrate also enhances the intestinal barrier by regulating the assembly of tight junctions. In addition, SCFAs are known to have anti-inflammatory properties.7",

Since the gut microbiota evolves rapidly in the neonatal period, the influence of this 1-week difference cannot be ruled out. Another limitation was that the week 1 samples were collected at an earlier postnatal age (median 2 day) compared to surgical infants (median 4 days). Surgical infants usually have delayed passage of meconium and infrequent passage of subsequent stools because of underlying gut anomaly, administration of narcotic analgesics, delayed commencement of enteral feeds and postoperative ileus.",
