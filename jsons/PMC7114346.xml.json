Many large-scale SGPs were launched on targets of full proteomes or subsets of targets from different genomes. The first, which focused on the archaebacteria Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (Christendat et al., 2000) was followed by other initiatives driven by large consortia in Europe (SPINE, http://www.spineurope.org/), Japan (RIKEN, http://www.rsgi.riken.go.jp/), the USA (PSI, http://kb.psi-structuralgenomics.org/) or transatlantic (SGC, http://www.sgc.utoronto.ca/). The main common objective was to generate structural data related to human health. There were no systematic pan-species approaches, as one genome was most of the time enough to keep a large consortium busy.",

This expression means that the \u201ceasy\u201d targets, ie., proteins proceeding without any major difficulty up to structural analysis, were addressed first. In that respect, VIZIER introduced a new variation in the meaning of the expression. For example, only two proteins, the NS3 and NS5 enzymes that are central to replication were considered in the Flavivirus genus. Consequently, a major goal was to obtain at least one crystal structure for any Flavivirus NS3 or NS5, or sub-domains. The term \u201clow hanging fruit\u201d would then refer to the first determined of those, which would in turn help to solve as many other related NS3 or NS5 as possible along the flaviviral phylogenetic tree. The \u201clow hanging\u201d target was therefore considered as a template to accelerate structure determination inside a viral genus or inside a class of enzymes.",

Indeed, once a first crystal structure is known, structural homologues are usually not as exciting as original unknown proteins bearing the potential to reveal a novel fold. Nevertheless, the pan-viral approach made it possible to hit several birds with one stone! Indeed, viral genomes being small-sized compared to eukaryotic genomes, the pan-viral approach was a \u201cmust\u201d to be eligible to a structural genomics denomination (and funding). First, it backed the concept of anticipating emerging viruses (see below). Second, it made it possible to try to produce or crystallize proteins of different isolates, enhancing the chances of success. A posteriori, the structural data in complement to the large-scale sequencing (viral genomics) within viral families may help to address the inevitable questions about polymorphisms and drug susceptibility/resistance, as has already occurred with the influenza neuramidase and HIV enzymes.",

            "text": "The pan-viral approach developed by VIZIER had an immediate consequence. If crystal structures are determined for each virus family, then if a new virus should emerge, its replication enzymes will resemble something that has already been characterized at the structural level, and there might already be an initial drug candidate. In fact, this concept was exemplified by coronavirus research before and during the SARS crisis. In 2002, the Hilgenfeld group (L\u00fcbeck University, Germany) and collaborators had determined the TGEV main proteinase structure, the first coronavirus protein crystal structure (Anand et al., 2002). The structural virology field was very young for coronaviruses, in line with most RNA viruses. Interestingly, this structural biology work provided an example of \u201cscientific anticipation\u201d directed towards getting the necessary scientific knowledge to design drugs against emerging RNA viruses. Indeed, TGEV protease inhibitors could be suggested based on the chloromethylketone pharmacophore, due to the active site similarity found with the rhinovirus 3Cpro. When the SARS-CoV emerged, the nucleotide sequence of this new coronavirus was made available on the internet shortly after virus isolation and identification (Marra et al., 2003). It took only days for Dr. Hilgenfeld to figure out that the SARS protease was closely related to that of TGEV, and to propose both a structural model and that the TGEV inhibitor backbone could serve as a potent starting point for anti-SARS-CoV drug design (Anand et al., 2003). Six months later, the structure of the SARS-CoV main protease structure was solved (Yang et al., 2003).",

The macro-domain of coronaviruses has been the subject of several structural studies within and outside VIZIER (Egloff et al., 2006, Saikatendu et al., 2005) and the translation of accumulated knowledge in the Togaviridae family undoubtedly accelerated the crystal structure determination of several Alphavirus macro-domains, including that of Chikungunya virus for which no crystal structure had been determined before (Malet et al., 2009).",

A possible reason why few of these proteins had been crystallized in 2004 lies in the difficulty of expressing them in a soluble form suitable for crystallization. Drawing on the flaviviral NS5 domain design (Choi et al., 2004, Malet et al., 2007), it was decided to systematize the \u201cmodular approach\u201d through the coupling of VIZIER's special bio-informatics and domain prediction, virology, and protein factory. In that sense, VIZIER was at the forefront in the application of high throughput (HTP) techniques to virus research. These techniques were classically present in laboratories performing antiviral screening, but not in academic virology labs.",

In VIZIER, defining a starting point was easy, because the need for viral genomics and post-genomics was identified early, as described above. However, one difficulty was to define where VIZIER should stop in the drug discovery/design process and leave further drug development to more specialized developers. One obvious end-line is the unpredictable nature of medicinal chemistry involved in hit-to-lead development. Any discovered hit for which structure-based chemistry has to be implemented would require specialized chemists. It seemed more appropriate to subcontract this secondary chemistry, rather than try to integrate all fields of medicinal chemistry into the VIZIER program. Therefore, VIZIER's aim was to provide structural data for drug design and as an option, hits to begin feeding the drug discovery pipeline.",

In principle, a pipeline organisation has several advantages. First, documentation of effort is easy and simple, provided that there is an appropriate Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). Duplication of effort is avoided and the optimal flow and feedback of information are facilitated, as well as sharing protocols and technical improvements through the database server. However, a central pipeline bears the obvious limitation of sequential organisation and dependence. If a single bottleneck appears somewhere in the pipeline, all of the downstream activity groups are at risk of being affected. Ideally, the pipeline has to run at an appropriate steady-state to irrigate various activities. This cannot be pre-existing at time zero of the project, and unpredictable difficulties have expectedly arisen to jeopardize the workflow. These difficulties have actually promoted the organisation of specialized workgroups focusing on targets of interest from a structural and/or antiviral design point of view.",

In fact, most predictors and tools were refined and developed during the project (Gorbalenya et al., this issue). Two tool-bases have been developed or implemented in VIZIER (VaZyMolO and Viralis). They have delivered hundreds of predictions either on a self-serve basis (VaZyMolO) or from request to an expert curator (Viralis). A version of VaZyMolO existed before VIZIER (Ferron et al., 2005), but it was considerably expanded and implemented during the project, and now has free access.

Perhaps one of the most important is the identification and elimination of \u201cuncrystallizable\u201d material at an early step. Domain definition had thus the first virtue of avoiding inter- or connecting domains which bring flexibility to a target in solution, impeding crystallization. It was also observed that the expression level of a multi-domain protein is not the algebraic sum of separated domain expression levels. As an example, the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of the flavivirus NS5 express separately to high levels, but the comparative expression of the full-length protein is considerably decreased. The reasons may be multiple (eg., protein degradation and/or cleavage, gene expression Care et al., 2008) and related to flexibility, but the full-length protein, when available, has proven less amenable to crystallization despite intense efforts in several labs.",

First, several structural modules of (+) ssRNA virus were already available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), rendering domain design easy, whereas no structural data was available on (\u2212) ssRNA viral replicases. Second, most of the (+) ssRNA viral non-structural proteins are processed by a protease suggesting that small modules could behave independently from others. In (\u2212) ssRNA virus non-structural proteins (nsp) no proteolysis occurs and the different domains may need to interact with each other, and may be unstable when produced alone. Nevertheless, successes regarding the influenza RdRp subunits using a random strategy seems to invalidate this hypothesis (Dias et al., 2009, Guilligay et al., 2008). Third, correctly designed modules may fail at the expression step for reasons related to the expression host and not the protein itself.",

Such a reservoir of strains of clinical relevance will be important for future studies. Relatively little and mostly fragmentary information on RNA viral genomes was available at the start of VIZIER in 2004. Complete genome sequence information is essential to obtain a comprehensive picture on genome organisation of RNA viruses, their genetic diversity and variability. However, this ultimate goal was achieved for a few virus families such as:\u2022Flaviviruses: all tick-borne flaviviruses, all Aedes-borne flaviviruses, all Culex-borne flaviviruses, all flaviviruses with no known vector (i.e., >40 viruses) were sequenced. In addition, new viruses infecting mosquitoes (\u201cinsectiviruses\u201d) were identified and 3 new species were completely sequenced (X. De Lamballerie, unpublished). Completion of the genus characterization was reached.\u2022Arenaviruses: the complete sequencing and analysis of 21 species has been produced. Their phylogeny has recently been reviewed (Charrel, 2008).

This is a notorious limitation for those who work on loosely characterized viral isolates, which have been subjected to many passages in cell culture. The genomics strategy included the need to sequence closely related strains of viruses. This decision was totally vindicated by the observation that closely related strains of the same virus show different characteristics when challenged with potential inhibitors of enzyme activity. These observations also led to the conclusion that future work will require greater emphasis on field isolates of viruses, to avoid the risk of designing antivirals targeting only laboratory strains. Thus, since viruses are amongst the most genetically variable organisms, we now recognise the need to study authentic field isolates whenever possible. This genomics strategy also emphasised the fact that the pre-VIZIER viral world present in the databases as whole genome nucleic acid sequences was wholly inadequate.",

In that case, the first crystal structure in an unknown viral family invariably represents a breakthrough. Later on, other related crystal structures are greatly facilitated through molecular replacement techniques making use of the first atomic coordinates. One may think that in terms of visibility and impact, subsequent crystal structures are less interesting for the crystallographer. It was found in many instances, however, that other original structure determination could come from various subsequent targets, expanding interest beyond the first-ever structure determined for a given virus family (Table 1\n).

Combining these multiple starts and stops leads to the cloning of constructs with different lengths for a given domain. As far as crystallization is concerned, this approach, named the \u201cmulti-construct strategy\u201d, was demonstrated to be about twice as successful as working to fine-tune the soluble expression of a single construct (Graslund et al., 2008).

This strategy had also its limitations, in particular for negative-stranded RNA viruses. Indeed, 247 domains were designed based on the L protein of the rhabdoviruses. None of them produced any crystals. Iterative additions or deletions of amino acid sequences may also help protein solubility, as in the case of the echovirus 30 2C domain. The addition of 5 amino acid increments allowed the selection of constructs expressing a soluble protein.

For example, 10 amongst 25 different helicases were produced and purified, most of the methyltransferases were purified, and 10 RdRps were produced for crystallization trials. For more difficult targets (eg., negative-stranded RNA viruses), using a large panel of homologues also helped to provide domains suitable for crystallization. For example, 17 different constructs of the arenavirus L1 domain were cloned and expressed, leading to the purification of two of them (success rate: 18%), highlighting the importance of taking advantage of sequence diversity (see Table 1). It is particularly interesting to note that the Parana virus L1 protein domain led to crystals whose maximum resolution could not be lowered below 8 \u00c5. Coupling both multi-constructs and multi-homologues strategy overcame this difficulty with the LCMV protein which provided crystals diffracting to 2.7 \u00c5.",

Among the 13 structures determined, all are from Orf1a. No structure was obtained from Orf1b within VIZIER. Nevertheless, the production of soluble proteins of Orf1b enabled functional and biochemical studies (Decroly et al., 2008, Nedialkova et al., 2009). One of the most striking observations that could be made from the structure results concerns the macro-domains. At the beginning of the project, the crystal structure of the SARS macro-domain was already available (Egloff et al., 2006). Moreover, macro-domains were thought to be dispensable for viral replication (Putics et al., 2005) and may be not good candidates for antiviral discovery/design. It could be thus questionable to focus on these domains and their production and structure determination, even though these domains belong to the \u201clow hanging fruit\u201d category. Actually, the structural and functional study of 5 more macro-domains showed significant structural differences in substrate affinity and selectivity amongst coronaviruses (Tan et al., 2009, Piotrowski et al., 2009). The invested efforts for coronavirus macro-domain design and production were helpful alphavirus macro-domain definition and crystallization (Malet et al., 2009). Although many structures are available now but the macro-domain role remains elusive, it is certainly much easier to tackle function assessment using reverse genetics in the alphavirus genus than in coronavirus. Indeed, infectious clones or subgenomic replicons are less labor-intensive in the former than in the latter genus. This example illustrates a possible benefit from a pan-virus analysis rather than relying on a unique virus model.",

For this exception, the structural work and the associated enzymatic work complemented each other in order to unravel both the first crystal structure for a viral family (Astroviridae) and the first demonstration of protease activity (Speroni et al., 2009). In that case, structure and activity of this viral family is clearly lagging behind more studied viruses. As indicated above, one VIZIER concept is to stay aware that any RNA virus may emerge in the near future. In that respect, and although Astroviridae work performed in VIZIER could not justify a full chapter in this issue, the human pathogenic astrovirus serine protease crystal structure determined at 2.0 \u00c5 resolution may one day speed up drug design. In the case of RdRps, for example, the details of initiation of RNA synthesis are quite diverse in the RNA virus world. Initiation may be primer-independent (eg., flaviviruses), primer-dependent (eg., arenaviruses), protein-primed (eg., picornaviruses), or just unknown (eg., coronaviruses). There are several examples in VIZIER of unexpected results that may have some relevance to drug design. For example, the Coxsackie virus 3D RdRp structure was determined in complex with VPg (Gruez et al., 2008) and found to form a complex different from that of the foot-and-mouth virus 3D RdRp\u2013VPg complex (Ferrer-Orta et al., 2006). Also, the calicivirus RdRp polymerase structure suggested enzyme experiments which showed that caliciviruses can initiate RNA synthesis both in a primer-independent and independent manner (Fullerton et al., 2007).",

Several hundreds of L and other protein constructs from a large and diverse virus collection were expressed in E. coli and insect cells, contributing to lower the pipeline statistics: only five crystal structures were determined and, amongst them two domains from L proteins. The first one is the N-terminal part of LCMV (referred as (\u2212) ss RNA virus with segmented genome in Table 3). The structural data did not yet relate this domain to any known fold from the PDB and provided only few evidences regarding its function. Nevertheless, reverse genetics is available for arenaviruses (reviewed in de la Torre (2008)), and this could rapidly indicate if this domain carries essential viral functions as well as be a relevant target for structure-based drug design against arenaviruses.",

In that case, selectivity or absence of selectivity towards a methyl group in N7 of the GTP ligand would discriminate between these two functions (Charrel et al., this issue).
