Although most modern ventilators are capable of providing the basic modes of synchronised (patient-triggered) ventilation, there are a variety of hybrid modes or combinations that may be unique to each manufacturer and device. For example, some ventilators make possible the combination of synchronised intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) and pressure support ventilation (PSV), and other ventilators employ PSV as a stand-alone mode with a backup rate, similar to assist/control (AC) but fl ow rather than time cycled. PSV eliminates the inspiratory hold, making for better synchronisation and automatically adjusting the effective inspiratory time ( T I ) as time constants change. However, this mode may not be appropriate in extremely small premature infants in the fi rst few days of life, in whom respiratory time constants are so short that the actual T I may be less than 0.25 s. This duration of inspiration may be inadequate for gas mixing in the terminal air spaces and additionally may lead to excessively rapid respiratory rates.",

            "text": "Ventilators designed primarily for adult/paediatric patients but capable of also supporting neonates tend to have a greater variety of modes (some untested in newborn infants) and to offer volume-controlled ventilation. Unlike on the specialty neonatal ventilators, PSV on these devices does not have a backup rate and thus requires a reliable respiratory effort, not often present in preterm infants. However, when ventilating newborn infants, the clinician must be aware of the pitfalls of applying various modes to this unique population. The major limitation of volume-controlled ventilation is that the device only controls the volume delivered into the proximal (ventilator) end of the circuit, not the volume entering the patient's lungs. Because of compression of gas and stretching of the circuit, as well as leak around uncuffed endotracheal tubes (ETT), there is only a very indirect relationship between set and delivered V T . For this reason, time-cycled, pressure-limited ventilation has been the standard ventilation mode in the NICU. There are several volume-targeted modes of pressure-limited ventilation with different operating principles and capabilities that more accurately control delivered V T in newborn infants. Some of these modalities have been studied in considerable detail and shown to reduce the incidence of hypocapnia, excessively large V T , duration of mechanical ventilation and to decrease levels of pro-infl ammatory cytokines (Keszler 2009 ). Volume-targeted ventilation is discussed in detail elsewhere in this book. The more conventional modes are discussed below, and suggestions regarding the most appropriate modes for neonatal ventilation are incorporated in Table 42 .1 .",

            "text": "Despite many years of daily use, no consensus has emerged regarding the relative merits of the commonly used modes of synchronised ventilation. Guidance from large prospective trials with important clinical outcomes, such as incidence of air leak, chronic lung disease or length of ventilation, is lacking. Short-term clinical trials have demonstrated less tachypnoea and less variable V T (Mrozek et al. 2000 ) , more rapid weaning from mechanical ventilation (Chan and Greenough 1994 ; Dimitriou et al. 1995 ) and smaller V T with smaller fl uctuations in blood pressure (Hummler et al. 1996 ) with AC, compared to SIMV. There are important physiological considerations suggesting that SIMV may not provide optimal support in very premature infants. SIMV supports a user-defi ned number of breaths synchronised with the infant's spontaneous respiratory effort. Spontaneous breaths in excess of the set rate are not supported, resulting in uneven tidal volume and high work of breathing during weaning. This is particularly important in extremely small and immature infants intubated with a narrow bore ETT (Fiastro et al. 1988 ). The high airway resistance of the ETT, limited muscle strength and mechanical disadvantage of the infant's excessively compliant chest wall result in small, ineffective V T . Small breaths that largely rebreathe dead space gas will contribute little to effective alveolar ventilation. To maintain adequate alveolar minute ventilation, relatively large V T is thus required with the limited number of mechanical infl ations provided by the ventilator. In a group of ELBW infants in the recovery phase of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) ventilated with SIMV, the V T of mechanical infl ations was about 6 mL/kg with spontaneous V T of 2.5 mL/kg, very close to anatomical dead space (Osorio et al. 2005 ) . However, most clinicians continue to use SIMV, particularly during the weaning phase (Sharma and Greenough 2007 ) . This is based on the intuitive assumption that fewer mechanical infl ations are less damaging and on the traditional thinking that the ventilator rate must be lowered before extubation. However, because lung injury is primarily caused by excessive V T , irrespective of the pressure required to generate that V T (Dreyfuss and Saumon 1993 ; Hernandez et al. 1989 ; Dreyfuss and Saumon 1998 ) , the smaller V T used with AC (Hummler et al. 1996 ) likely outweighs the faster rate. This concept is supported by the Oxford Region Controlled Trial of Artifi cial Ventilation study where a ventilator rate of 60 infl ations per min compared to 20-40 was shown to result in less air leak with unsynchronised IMV (OCTAVE Study Group 1991 ) . Many clinicians also mistakenly believe that assisting every breath prevents respiratory muscle training. This concern refl ects a poor understanding of the patient-ventilator interaction during synchronised ventilation. With synchronised ventilation, the V T is generated by the combined inspiratory effort of the patient (the baby pulling air in) and the positive pressure generated by the ventilator pushing air in. The resulting transpulmonary pressure, together with the compliance of the respiratory system, determines the V T . Thus, as ventilator infl ation pressure is decreased during weaning, the infant gradually assumes a greater proportion of the work of breathing and achieves respiratory muscle training. Ultimately, the ventilator pressure is decreased to the point when it only overcomes the added resistance of the ETT and circuit, at which point the infant should be extubated.",

The differences become more meaningful during weaning, especially at rates <20. The less intuitive weaning process with AC appears to be one of the reasons clinicians continue to employ SIMV during weaning from mechanical ventilation. Another reason is the anecdotal observation that sometimes infants become tachypnoeic with AC and may have mild hypocapnia. This tachypnoea may refl ect the infant's response to low mean airway pressure ( P AW ) during weaning -shortening the expiratory time ( T E ) serves to maintain lung volume at end expiration. Tachypnoea appears to be infrequent when decreasing peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is balanced by higher PEEP to avoid loss of lung volume. Low rate SIMV, especially in small infants with 2.5-mm-diameter ETT, is likely to impair the weaning process. Some ventilators offer the option of supporting spontaneous breaths with pressure support ventilation. This will compensate for the problems associated with simple SIMV but becomes a more complex process requiring the clinician to select settings for both SIMV and the level of pressure support.",

Based on these fi ndings, it is recommended that when SIMV is used during the weaning process, PSV should be utilised to support spontaneous breathing. The alternate and less complicated approach is to use AC or PSV as a stand-alone mode to assist all spontaneous efforts and simply wean the infl ations pressure, taking care to maintain adequate P AW . This is most easily accomplished when using volume-targeted modes of ventilation discussed earlier in this book. Finally, the attributes of the particular ventilator may infl uence the choice of triggered modes. Many fl ow-triggered devices are susceptible to autotriggering due to leak around the ETT. This is more problematic with AC than with SIMV, where the mechanical breath rate is limited. Devices that have a very effective leak-adapted trigger and breath termination algorithms, such as the Draeger Babylog, are virtually immune from this problem and thus facilitate the use of AC.",

There should be a stepwise approach to setting the ventilator at the time of initiation of mechanical ventilation (Table 42 .2 ), guided in part by a thorough clinical appraisal (Table 42 .3 ). PEEP should be considered fi rst, with suggested PEEP levels for a range of different situations set out in Table 42 .1 . The T I should be set at around 0.5 s for a term infant and 0.35 s for a preterm infant, and then further adjusted depending on the analysis of the fl ow-time curve, which can be displayed on most modern neonatal ventilators. For most applications of time-cycled pressure-limited ventilation, T I should be set long enough to allow complete or near-complete infl ow of gas into the lung during inspiration. If the T I is too short, there may not be suffi cient time for an adequate tidal volume to be delivered nor for alveolar recruitment to occur with each tidal infl ation. Setting PIP should be guided by a visual appreciation of chest rise and preferably the measured V T . Suggested target values for V T are set out in Table 42 .1 . Finally, T E (and thus, respiratory rate) is adjusted, with the aim of producing suffi cient minute ventilation to clear CO 2 without causing dynamic hyperinfl ation related to inadvertent PEEP. An estimate of minute ventilation can be made using the product of measured V T and respiratory rate, with a value of 200-300 mL/kg/min usually being an adequate starting point before the fi rst pCO 2 reading is obtained. Note that this estimate of minute ventilation does not incorporate dead space volume, which is substantial in some infants, particularly those with hyperinfl ated lungs (\"alveolar dead space\"). Additionally, rapid shallow breathing leads to high dead space to V T ratio and reduced alveolar ventilation. Avoidance of inadvertent PEEP can be diffi cult when an infant has a rapid spontaneous breathing rate and each breath is being supported by the ventilator. Examination of the fl ow-time curve during expiration will reveal whether gas outfl ow is complete before the next infl ation begins and thus whether dynamic hyperinfl ation is likely to occur. If so, further adjustment to the mode of ventilation, respiratory rate and even inspiratory time may be necessary, as discussed below.",

Careful note of the rate of spontaneous ventilation, and the effectiveness of triggering, should be made as the infant recovers from the intubation and the effects of any sedative and muscle relaxant drugs used prior to it. The need for further sedation/analgesia should be assessed. Muscle relaxation is rarely indicated in These parameters to be set in the order suggested PEEP -set according to context (see Table 42 .1 ) and oxygen requirement T I -suffi cient to allow complete gas infl ow to occur (and longer, if tidal recruitment needed) PIP -suffi cient to produce adequate chest movement (and V T , when measured) T E (or ventilator rate) a -set so as to allow complete gas outfl ow to occur and, in combination with V T , to produce adequate minute ventilation PEEP positive end-expiratory pressure, T I inspiratory time, PIP peak infl ation pressure, V T tidal volume, T E expiratory time a In some ventilators, the rate is set directly, and in others it is determined by the combination of inspiratory and expiratory time the era of effective synchronised ventilation. Narcotic analgesia should be used judiciously; clinical trial evidence suggests morphine administration relieves pain in ventilated neonates but may increase the risk of adverse neurological outcomes (Anand et al. 2004 ). If spontaneous breathing is to continue, the trigger sensitivity may need to be altered to optimise patient-ventilator interaction. In general, the trigger threshold should be as low as possible without causing autocycling, because higher trigger threshold is associated with higher work of breathing and longer trigger delay. An attempt should always be made to confi rm whether \"triggered\" infl ations are actually preceded by spontaneous respiratory effort or, alternatively, whether the ventilator is autocycling. The latter situation is more likely when there is a signifi cant tube leak (despite \"tube compensation\") (Bernstein et al. 1995 ) , or with condensed water collecting in the ventilator tubing, and can lead to very signifi cant hyperventilation particularly in AC mode. Observation of the chest rise and abdominal motion will give some guide to the delivered V T , although this is a clinical skill that requires some time to learn (Aufricht et al. 1993 ) , and may underestimate the actual V T (Schmolzer et al. 2010 ) . High residual work of breathing may refl ect inadequate tidal volume or inadequate minute ventilation, and ventilator settings should be adjusted appropriately. In the immediate post-intubation period, respiratory system compliance may be transiently decreased due to gaseous abdominal distension, especially after prolonged face mask ventilation. Venting of the stomach with a tube should occur soon after intubation to overcome any impairment of respiratory system compliance related to gastric distension with gas (Heldt 1988 ) . Airway obstruction or ETT malposition should also be ruled out if the infant appears to be struggling.",

All mechanically ventilated infants should have, at the very least, cardiorespiratory monitoring, continuous measurement of oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) via a transcutaneous pulse oximetry probe and temperature monitoring (Table 42.4 ). An intra-arterial catheter to continuously monitor blood pressure and allow periodic arterial blood gas sampling is essential in the unstable and critically ill infant and highly desirable in any infant requiring mechanical ventilation. A continuous estimate of pCO 2 derived from transcutaneous monitoring or end-tidal gas sampling is also valuable, whether or not an arterial line is in place. Because ET CO 2 monitoring adds signifi cantly to the instrumental dead space and is often inaccurate in small infants whose rapid respiratory rates do not allow an end-tidal plateau to be reached, transcutaneous monitoring is to be preferred in most ventilated neonates.",

The delivered V T (and the target V T , if set) should be noted, along with the proportion of leak. To be accurate, V T must be measured at the airway opening, not at the ventilator end of the circuit. Whilst some devices offer a compliance compensation feature that corrects for the loss of V T in the circuit, this feature does not function well in the presence of ETT leak. The humidifi er temperature should be regularly checked and recorded. Most modern ventilators also provide continuous display of waveforms and/or tidal ventilation loops, and these, along with breath-by-breath compliance and resistance measurements, can be very helpful in fi ne-tuning ventilator settings, as described in this and other chapters in this text. (Rimensberger 2002 ; Clark et al. 2000 ) . Such an approach is dependent on the application of suffi cient PEEP, and the physiological considerations that guide PEEP setting are discussed in this section. Clinical and experimental data point to a clear relationship between PEEP and EELV and, thus, oxygenation. Changes in other ventilator settings may, however, potentially lead to alterations in EELV. A long-held belief was that an increase in P AW by alteration of any combination of ventilator settings would have a similar impact on oxygenation and thus that there should be an optimal P AW at which to apply ventilation (Boros et al. 1977 ) . It is now becoming accepted that the components that make up the P AW (PIP, PEEP, T I , rate and gas fl ow) should be considered separately. As stated by Monkman and Kirpalani: In retrospect, the simplifying but reductionist elegance that focused upon a single unitary number [P AW ] may have misled the fi eld. (Monkman and Kirpalani 2003 ) Thus, an improvement in oxygenation after a PEEP increase should not be viewed as having occurred simply because the P AW is higher but rather because EELV has increased and & V Q / matching has improved. Despite also producing P AW changes, alteration in other ventilator parameters does not have the same effect on EELV ( Fig. 42 .1 ) (Thome et al. 1998 ) nor on oxygenation (Stewart et al. 1981 ) . The inextricable linkage between PEEP, EELV and oxygenation dictates that it is PEEP that is the fi rst, and arguably the EELV is seen to reduce with stepwise reductions in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and thus mean airway pressure ( P AW , denoted as MAP) during the fi rst 30 min. At minute 34, inspiratory time is lengthened from 0.3 to 0.6 s, leading to an increase in P AW , but no significant change in EELV. Conversely, when PEEP is increased (minute 52), there is a substantial improvement in EELV (Reproduced from Thome et al. ( 1998 ) with permission) most important, ventilatory parameter to be considered in the continuing management of the ventilated neonate. An important diffi culty in manipulating EELV in the ventilated subject is that the available methods to measure EELV at the bedside are imprecise and in some cases impractical . Whole-body plethysmography (Stocks et al. 2001 ) and gas dilution (Sivan et al. 1990 ; Vilstrup et al. 1992 ) , both of which give absolute values for EELV, are not appropriate for repeated measurements in a clinical setting. Other methods, including respiratory inductance plethysmography (Adams 1996 ; Emeriaud et al. 2010 ) , fi bre-optic plethysmography (Davis et al. 1999 ) and electrical impedance tomography (Frerichs et al. 2001 ), allow measurement not of absolute volume but of change in EELV relative to a baseline condition, and only with prior calibration can a gas volume change in mL be derived. Despite these limitations, a great deal of information has been obtained from experimental studies in which EELV has been measured, either at the bedside or in the laboratory, as alterations in PEEP have been made. The key fi ndings of this work are set out below. This knowledge can be used by clinicians to set and titrate PEEP in ventilated subjects, aided by indirect measures of EELV, in particular oxygenation and tidal breath compliance.",

            "text": "An understanding of what can potentially be achieved through manipulation of lung volume using PEEP comes from fi rstly examining the changes in EELV and recruitment during stepwise PEEP manoeuvres. Such information is derived from lung modelling, studies in experimental animals and in humans with lung disease. An example is shown in Fig. 42 .2 . With stepwise PEEP increments and a constant infl ating pressure (PIP-PEEP), a surfactant-depleted lung starting at residual volume follows the path of the infl ation limb of the pressure-volume (PV) relationship ( Fig. 42.2 ) , with an improvement in tidal breath compliance as more non-aerated lung units are recruited, followed by a fall in compliance as more lung units become overdistended near total lung capacity. During PEEP decrements ( Fig. 42. 2 ), the property of hysteresis is demonstrated with a different PV trajectory than during PEEP increments, following a path closer to the defl ation limb of the PV relationship. There is preservation of recruitment through a large proportion of this trajectory, and the open tidal ventilation loops refl ect the marked improvement in compliance during PEEP decrements, as has been predicted by lung modelling (Hickling 2001 ) . At the point of maximal curvature of the defl ation limb (\"closing pressure\"), the lung is still well infl ated, recruitment is largely preserved and tidal ventilation at this point is associated with minimal overdistension and a peak in compliance. This is the point of \"optimal PEEP\", at which the lung is ventilated with the best possible oxygenation and compliance and with the least Stepwise vital capacity manoeuvre in the injured lung.

In the experimental animal with recruitable lungs, PEEP set in relation to the point of maximal curvature of the defl ation limb is often at or below the PEEP value predicted from the lower infl ection point of the infl ation limb (Rimensberger et al. 1999a ). Finding optimal PEEP as described above is not diffi cult in experimental animals, as long as the lung is recruitable and can withstand brief infl ation to total lung capacity. The technique has also been applied to adult subjects with acute respiratory distress syndrome (Amato et al. 1998 ; Suarez-Sipmann and Bohm 2009 ), allowing confi rmation of many of the physiological features noted in the laboratory. A limiting factor is that if the lung has few recruitable units, there will be minimal hysteresis and the PEEP at the point of maximal curvature of the defl ation limb may actually be higher than the PEEP at the lower infl ection point on the infl ation limb, with minimal benefi t in compliance, and the risk of overdistension with each tidal breath (Albaiceta et al. 2005 ) .",

            "text": "In mechanically ventilated newborn infants, there have been few attempts to fi nd optimal PEEP using stepwise increments and decrements as described above. The PV relationship of the lung has, however, been mapped in ventilated infants on high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), allowing defi nition of hysteresis and a point of maximal curvature (closing pressure) on the defl ation limb (Tingay et al. 2006 ) . Similar PV tracing during HFOV, using oxygenation as in indicator of lung volume, is routinely used in some institutions to identify optimal P AW (De Jaegere et al. 2006 ). The defl ation limb of the PV relationship has also been traced in preterm infants using a quasistatic technique performed over a maximum of 10 s (Vilstrup et al. 1996 ) . A point of maximal curvature appears to be identifi able in each recording, but in this early study, no attempt was made to use this landmark for PEEP setting. In parallel with adult studies, there has been some attempt to set PEEP in newborn infants based on the shape of the inspiratory PV curve, traced over 30 s after a 5 s disconnection to ambient pressure (Mathe et al. 1987 ). An infl ection point was identifi able in each infant, with greater concavity in those with more severe disease (indicating potential for recruitment). Change in the position of the infl ection point, and the concavity of the infl ation limb, was noted with resolution of disease ( Fig. 42.3 ) . Setting PEEP by this method improved oxygenation in infants at the height of disease, but not those in the recovery phase (Mathe et al. 1987 ) .",

            "text": "With the exception of these more penetrating studies, the investigation of PEEP and PEEP setting in ventilated neonates has been limited to studies of short-lived PEEP adjustments, in some cases with stepwise PEEP increments analogous to the titration of CPAP described in the very earliest reports of this therapy (Gregory et al. 1971 ) . Increases in PEEP universally lead to an increase in EELV (Thome et al. 1998 ; Dinger et al. 2001 ; Bose et al. 1986 ) and an improvement in oxygenation (Stewart et al. 1981 ; Dinger et al. 2001 ; Bose et al. 1986 ). In the diseased lung, the oxygenation response to increasing EELV is related to both decreased venoarterial shunting due to recruitment of non-aerated lung units and improvement of & V / Q matching with better gas aeration. The potential for PEEP to induce change in EELV in the ventilated neonate is signifi cantly greater than for isolated changes in PIP or T I ( Thome et al. 1998 ). PEEP increases were most usually associated with a fall in tidal compliance suggesting overdistension (Dinger et al. 2001 ; Alegria et al. 2006 ) . Infants with more severe lung disease may, however, demonstrate an improvement in compliance with PEEP increments indicating lung recruitment (Dinger et al. 2001 ). The level of applied PEEP also has the potential to impact upon cardiac function, but it is clear that the adverse effects of PEEP on cardiac output are much more prominent in the normal lung (Holzman and Table 42 .5 The benefi ts of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) optimisation in the diseased lung Maintenance of lung recruitment Defence against absorption atelectasis in high FiO 2 Improved lung compliance and thus a reduction in peak infl ation pressure to achieve the same tidal volume Better oxygenation and a reduction in FiO 2 More effi cient CO 2 removal More even distribution of ventilation Preservation of surfactant Reduction in lung injury Scarpelli 1979 ) . This relates to the transmission of intra-alveolar pressure to the pleural and mediastinal compartment, which is substantially greater in a recruited lung. Indeed, one study in the pre-surfactant era used rise in pleural pressure (as indicated by oesophageal pressure) to indicate the point at which lung recruitment had occurred during PEEP increments (Bonta et al. 1977 ) . The fi ndings of these studies are heavily infl uenced by the severity of lung disease in the subjects under study and the starting point and span of PEEP settings used. There has also been considerable reluctance to keep the driving pressure constant with PEEP adjustments, in part related to a misconception that PEEP by itself produces lung recruitment. Recruitment is an inspiratory phenomenon; the value of PEEP is in maintaining recruitment of open lung units at end expiration (Gattinoni et al. 2003 ) . None of the PEEP-titration studies in neonates have until recently emulated the \"open lung\" concept of lung recruitment followed by titration of PEEP using small pressure decrements (Suarez-Sipmann and Bohm 2009 ; Lachmann 1992 ) . The only study designed to maintain stable pressure amplitude during PEEP increments investigated the effect of a lung recruitment maneuver (LRM) with incremental PEEP adjustments in infants with mean GA of 25 wk ventilated for RDS with AC+VG in a small randomized trial . LRM consisted of 0.2 cm H 2 O increments in PEEP every 5 minutes, until FiO 2 reached 0.25, followed by reduction of PEEP until oxygenation began to deteriorate. If FiO 2 rose, PEEP was increased again to re-recruit the lung and then reduced again to situate the lungs on the defl ation limb of the pressure/volume curve. Initial FiO 2 was 56 \u00b1 24 versus 52 \u00b1 21, in the two groups. The full LRM lasted for 61 \u00b1 18 minutes. The infants appeared to have only mild lung disease, with maximum PEEP reaching only 6.1 \u00b1 0.3 cm H 2 O. LRM lead to faster weaning of FiO 2 (94 \u00b1 24 versus 435 \u00b1 221 minutes; p = 0.000) and shorter O 2 dependency (29 \u00b1 12 versus 45 \u00b1 17 days; p = 0.04). No adverse events and no differences in the outcomes were observed. Though limited by the modest severity of illness and small sample size, the study suggests that LRM with incremental PEEP adjustments is feasible during conventional ventilation.",

            "text": "1. There is no universal PEEP setting that is correct for all lung diseases, or even for one disease, or even for one individual through the course of their disease. Units that choose to mandate a PEEP level for reasons of simplicity or the need to protocolise ventilator settings are missing opportunities to manage respiratory failure optimally and according to sound physiological reasoning. Suggested ranges for PEEP are given in Table 42 .1 ; these should be considered in the light of the individual circumstances, with further adjustment according to the physiological response and the course of the disease. The PEEP setting should be reevaluated whenever there is an alteration to pulmonary mechanics, for example, after surfactant administration (Goldsmith et al. 1991 ). 2. Unquestionably, very low PEEP (and zero PEEP) is inappropriate in the diseased lung (Monkman and Kirpalani 2003 ) , predisposing to low EELV, poor oxygenation, impaired pulmonary mechanics, greater turnover of surfactant and a risk of greater lung injury. 3. Conversely, a PEEP level that is set too high for too long leads to overdistension of the lung, impairment of venous return and cardiac output and predisposition to pneumothorax. 4. PEEP is not, of itself, a recruitment tool, and PEEP increments will not recruit the lung optimally without an adequate infl ating pressure (PIP-PEEP) to reinfl ate non-aerated lung units. Once the lung is recruited, the PEEP (and PIP) must then be turned down. 5. PEEP is effective in maintaining lung volume in circumstances predisposing to atelectasis, for example, during anaesthesia (Easa et al. 1995 ) and/or after administration of muscle relaxants (von Ungern-Sternberg et al. 2006 ) . PEEP also helps to minimise absorption atelectasis associated with ventilation using 100 % oxygen (von Ungern-Sternberg et al. 2007 ).",

Infants with poorly compliant lungs secondary to RDS have very short time constants and thus require only a very short T I for equilibration to occur (as low as 0.15 s). This may, however, be insuffi cient time for tidal recruitment to occur during the inspiratory phase. Setting T I in the diseased lung must therefore fi nd a balance between the wish to minimise the duration of plateau pressure at peak infl ation and the need to provide adequate time for the recruiting effect of the pressure plateau. Early ventilation strategies in ventilated neonates evolved to the use of a long T I , in part because of the lack of PEEP, and the observation that longer T I and slower ventilator rates improved oxygenation in infants with RDS (Reynolds 1971 ) . With further, and more probing, clinical observations, it became clear that this pattern of ventilation was contrary to the spontaneous respiratory efforts of a preterm infant (South and Morley 1986 ) , unless muscle-relaxed. Clinical trials comparing long T I (0.66-1.0 s) with short T I (0.33-0.5 s) subsequently demonstrated an advantage in the shorter T I group, including a slight reduction in mortality and a clear decrease in the risk of air leak, particularly in infants with RDS (OCTAVE Study Group 1991 ; Kamlin and Davis 2004 ) .",

Inappropriately long set T I may lead to dyssynchrony, with the infant exhaling against the ventilator infl ation pressure. Conversely if T I is too short (or lung volume loss too rapid), the infant may interrupt expiration with a further inspiratory effort during the ventilator expiratory cycle (McCallion et al. 2005 ) . From the suggested fi rst T I settings (0.5 s in the term infant, 0.35 s in the preterm infant, see above), adjustments should be made based on the appearance of the fl ow waveform. T I should be prolonged if there is clearly insuffi cient time for fl ow to enter the lung. Shortening of the T I should be considered if there is a prolonged period of zero fl ow with an infl ation pressure plateau; a suggested maximum for this period is one-third of the total infl ation time. Recommended ranges for within which to set T I in the ventilated newborn are 0.25-0.4 s in preterm infants and 0.4-0.6 s in those at full term.",

Monitoring and recording of V T is now routine in most neonatal intensive care units (van Kaam et al. 2010 ) , and with the availability of volume-targeted modes or volumecontrolled ventilation, there has been a shift of focus away from the PIP applied and towards the V T that results.

For the lung compromised by immaturity, disease or both, maintenance of an adequate V T during conventional ventilation is of paramount importance. There is compelling evidence for the need to monitor, target and limit tidal volumes in the ventilated neonate, with the clear message that both high and low V T settings can be dangerous (Keszler 2009 ). By virtue of the resultant stretch injury, ventilation with excessive V T in the neonate has the potential to cause long-standing damage. The combination of immature lung architecture and a highly compliant chest wall renders the newborn lung, and especially the preterm lung, uniquely vulnerable to overdistension and stretch injury (Clark et al. 2000 ) . Laboratory investigations have highlighted the danger of ventilation with high tidal volumes (Dreyfuss and Saumon 1998 ; Dreyfuss et al. 1988 ) with even a few large tidal infl ations causing extensive lung injury in the immature lung (Bjorklund et al. 1997 ) . It is also clear that the severity and distribution of injury in this setting depend not only on the magnitude of V T but also on the state of the lung at end expiration, including the degree of recruitment and residual aeration of lung units (Clark et al. 2000 ; Chiumello et al. 2008 ) . Application of high V T to an atelectatic lung causes signifi cant alveolar injury maximal in the nondependent regions, i.e. those areas that remain expanded at end expiration (Tsuchida et al. 2006 ) . Prior reversal of atelectasis by surfactant treatment substantially attenuates the lung injury related to high V T in the preterm lung (Wada et al. 1997 ) , presumably because the gas delivered with each infl ation is more evenly distributed, with less resultant regional overdistension .",

Ventilation of the atelectatic lung at relatively low V T is associated with insuffi cient alveolar recruitment and EELV, poor gas exchange (Probyn et al. 2004 ) and considerable lung injury (Muscedere et al. 1994 ) , with a predilection for the small airways. If, and only if, the lung is adequately recruited can the benefi ts of \"gentle ventilation\" with relatively small tidal volumes be realised. The combination of an \"open lung\" (Lachmann 1992 ) and low V T provides adequate gas exchange and markedly reduces the risk of lung injury during mechanical ventilation (Rimensberger 2002 ; Rimensberger et al. 1999a , b ; van Kaam et al. 2004 ). Studies of this approach in ventilated adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome have shown reduced mortality and more rapid weaning from ventilation (Amato et al. 1998 ; ARDS Network 2000 ) . Controlled clinical trials of an open lung approach have yet to be conducted in ventilated newborns (van Kaam and Rimensberger 2007 ) .",

Given the vulnerability of the preterm lung in the early days of life, an upper acceptable limit of 6-7 mL/kg is suggested in infants less than 32 weeks. There are particular circumstances in which a V T as low as 5 mL/kg may still induce injury. Infants with diaphragmatic hernia have immature and underdeveloped lungs which are exquisitely sensitive to volutrauma and by virtue of the reduced total lung capacity tend to respire with V T values less than 5 mL/kg (Te Pas et al. 2009 ). For these infants the safe upper limit for V T may be below 5 mL/kg. Similar considerations apply for neonates with pulmonary hypoplasia from other causes, including preterm infants born after early and prolonged rupture of membranes.",

The concern is that such low values of V T may over time be insuffi cient to maintain alveolar recruitment, in particular when low PEEP settings are used (Keszler 2006 ) . A clinical trial comparing V T targets of 3 and 5 mL/kg found the lower value to be associated with an increase in pro-infl ammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fl uid . V T targets below 5 mL/kg may be inappropriate in chronically ventilated preterm infants, in whom the V T required to maintain normocapnia was noted to increase to 6 mL/kg by the third week of ventilation ). Additionally, there is a small but signifi cant effect of the fi xed instrumental dead space of the fl ow sensor necessary to measure VT. This additional dead space becomes proportionally larger in the smallest infants, resulting in the need for tidal volume of about 6 ml/kg to maintain normocapnia in infants around 500g, compared to larger preterm infants (Nassabeh-Montazami 2009 ).",

            "text": "Selection of respiratory rate is a function of the mode of ventilation (SIMV vs AC, \u00b1volume targeting) as well as the clinical scenario and degree of compromise of CO 2 clearance. Some of the pioneering work on neonatal ventilation arrived at low ventilator rates and long T I as an appropriate strategy for neonatal ventilation. The technical limitations of the ventilators used, including the inability to directly provide PEEP, infl uenced this choice. Several clinical trials have found rapid respiratory rates (\u226560/min), along with shorter T I , to be less injurious to the lung than slower rates (OCTAVE Study Group 1991 ; Pohlandt et al. 1992 ) . Additionally the use of a rapid ventilator rate allows more opportunity for synchrony given the rapid respiratory rate and short T I of most infants with lung disease (South and Morley 1992 ) . Suggestions for setting of respiratory rate are shown in Table 42 .6 . The combination of a rapid ventilator rate and a relatively long T I may lead to dynamic hyperinfl ation related to the development of inadvertent PEEP (Simbruner 1986 ) . Whilst some investigators have looked upon this as a way to improve lung recruitment, physiological fi rst principles and experimen-tal evidence would suggest that it is better to apply suffi cient PEEP at the airway opening rather than rely on the generation of an unknown and variable amount of inadvertent PEEP to improve lung volume (Yanos et al. 1998 ). Avoidance of dynamic hyperinfl ation is thus an important goal of neonatal ventilation, in particular in the context of an increased resistance to airfl ow. The fl ow waveform should be examined to ensure there is suffi cient expiratory time for complete exhalation. A more defi nitive test for measurement of inadvertent PEEP has been described, which involves insertion of a T-piece in the ventilator circuit, brief interruption of ventilation by clamping and measurement of equilibrium pressure distal to the clamp (Simbruner 1986 ). If there is suspicion of incomplete exhalation, available options to prolong expiratory time include (a) reduction of ventilator rate with T I kept constant or (b) shortening of T I , if appropriate, whilst keeping ventilator rate constant. A combination of both of these may be the best solution.",

Indwelling arterial oxygen sensors are no longer in use, and pO 2 readings in blood taken from an arterial line give only a snapshot in time. For this reason, moment by moment adjustments in FiO 2 are usually made on the basis of SpO 2 readings, and it is clear that many infants, in particular preterm infants, spend considerable amounts of time with SpO 2 readings (and therefore PaO 2 levels) outside the desired or target range (Hagadorn et al. 2006 ; Laptook et al. 2006 ; Claure et al. 2011 ) . Given the shortages of nursing personnel in many neonatal units, very signifi cant changes in SpO 2 may go unnoticed and uncorrected for some time, putting a patient at risk of the effects of hypoxia or hyperoxia (Claure et al. 2011 ; Bolivar et al. 1995 ) . Automated control of FiO 2 , discussed elsewhere in this text, offers the possibility of better targeting of SpO 2 ranges and less hyperoxia (Claure et al. 2011 ) but remains largely unavailable at present. Frequent adjustments to FiO 2 are required in many ventilated newborns, in particular those with episodes of frequent apnoea or chest splinting in expiration (Bolivar et al. 1995 ) . Prolonged periods of high FiO 2 may be necessary in infants with very signifi cant parenchymal disease, pulmonary hypertension or both. In general, every opportunity should be taken to reduce FiO 2 , both by choosing the lowest acceptable SpO 2 target and by optimising lung volume and recruitment at every juncture.",

            "text": "The association of hyperoxia with adverse pulmonary, neurological and retinal effects in the preterm infant is well understood and is discussed elsewhere in this book. In the era of saturation monitoring, relative hyperoxia (SpO 2 \u226595 %) from 32 weeks corrected gestation or beyond has been associated with progression of chronic lung disease (STOP-ROP Multicenter Study Group 2000 ; Askie et al. 2003 ) , without altering the outcome of retinopathy (STOP-ROP Multicenter Study Group 2000 ). More recently, a number of clinical trials, conducted in the USA, Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand, have compared target SpO 2 ranges of 85-89 % and 91-95 % commenced soon after birth in preterm infants <28 weeks gestation. These target ranges remained in force up until 36 weeks corrected gestation, as long as the infant is receiving supplemental oxygen. An initial report from each of these studies has now been published (Carlo et al. 2010 ; Schmidt et al. 2013 ; Stenson et al. 2013 ) , and an individual patient meta-analysis combining data from all trials (the NeOProM collaboration) is awaited (Stenson 2013 ) . Three methodological issues in these trials bear consideration. The fi rst is that for both high (91-95 %) and low (85-89 %) target groups, the actual SpO 2 readings when in supplemental oxygen were at the high end of the Where there is a duct-dependent pulmonary blood fl ow, supplemental oxygen may constrict or close the ductus arteriosus intended range, likely a refl ection of a well-documented tendency for bedside staff to target the high end of an SpO 2 range (Clucas et al. 2007 ). Moreover, the upward shift in actual SpO 2 readings was more prominent in the lower target group, with a median SpO 2 value of around 90-91 %, and on average only a 3 % separation between readings in the two groups, rather than the 6 % that would have been expected. The second methodological consideration is that while the trials were being conducted, the SpO 2 calibration curve within the oximeters being used was found to under-represent SpO 2 values of 87-90 % (Stenson 2013 ) . Installation of a revised algorithm in the UK and Australian trials led in to a clearer separation in SpO 2 readings between the groups, and appeared to affect the outcomes (see below). The fi nal methodological issue is that in only one of the studies (the COT study, Schmidt et al. 2013 ) were both upper and lower alarms limits clearly stipulated and enforced, which may have affected the proportion of extreme SpO 2 values, and thus potentially the results.",

            "text": "There are good experimental data in support of the role of permissive hypercapnia in lung injury protection (as discussed elsewhere in this book). These effects go beyond the reduced minute ventilation that goes hand in hand with permissive hypercapnia; elevated FiCO 2 appears to offer protection independent of minute ventilation (Peltekova et al. 2010 ). The need for lower minute ventilation should in itself reduce lung injury in the preterm infant, although this hypothesis, whilst supported in a small single-centre trial (Mariani et al. 1999 ) , was not clearly validated in the large clinical trial conducted by the Neonatal Research Network (Carlo et al. 2002 ) . The safe limits of PaCO 2 are diffi cult to determine from available literature. Despite decades of use of mechanical ventilation of newborn infants, the number and quality of studies specifi cally addressing this critical question is surprisingly low. There is unequivocal evidence that low PaCO 2 is associated with increased risk of severe intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) and periventricular leukomalacia (Graziani et al. 1992 ; Fujimoto et al. 1994 ; Wiswell et al. 1996 ; Okumura et al. 2001 ; Collins et al. 2001 ) and that very high levels, especially in preterm infants during the fi rst few days of life, may also increase the risk of IVH (Kaiser et al. 2006 ; Fabres et al. 2007 ) . The data of Fabres et al. indicated that even modestly decreased PaCO 2 (<39 mmHg) was associated with a twofold increase in IVH, as was a maximal PaCO 2 over 60 mmHg and prolonged exposure to a PaCO 2 greater than 52 mmHg. However, safe lower and upper limits remain an open question. The postnatal age of the infant, the degree of prematurity and coexisting morbidities, such as asphyxia, hypotension and sepsis, which are known to impair cerebral blood fl ow autoregulation, all affect the vulnerability of the patient to high or low levels of CO 2 . The studies showing association of hypercapnia and IVH focussed on the early postnatal period. The only large prospective clinical trial of permissive hypercapnia suggests safety of mild permissive hypercapnia, but the mean PaCO 2 remained between 45 and 50 mmHg for the fi rst 7 days of life in the \"hypercapnia\" group (Carlo et al. 2002 ) . This study does not, therefore, refute the retrospective data suggesting increased risk of adverse outcomes with maximal PaCO 2 values above 60 mmHg during the fi rst week of life (Fabres et al. 2007 ) . Whilst there are very plausible pathophysiological mechanisms which link hypercapnia to IVH, it must be recognised that the retrospective studies cannot establish causation. It is possible that high CO 2 values are a marker for other events or a refl ection of the severity of illness rather than the cause of the IVH. A relatively small prospective trial targeting PaCO 2 values between 55 and 65 from birth enrolled only one-third of the projected sample size (65 infants) before being stopped early because target PCO 2 values could not be reached (Thome et al. 2006 ). This study found no difference in pulmonary outcomes but an increase in the composite outcome of death or neurological impairment at 18-22 months from 42 to 62 % in the hypercapnia group, despite a difference of only 6 mmHg in PaCO 2 values between the groups.",

Experimental studies clearly show, however, that local tissue pH, not pCO 2 , is the primary determinant of cerebral vasoconstriction or dilatation (Fencl et al. 1968 ; Kontos et al. 1977 ) . Rapid changes in PaCO 2 are also dangerous and should be avoided, because they lead to rapid changes in cerebral blood fl ow (Raichle et al. 1970 ; Gleason et al. 1989 ) . A large retrospective study of 849 preterm infants concluded that not only both extremes of CO 2 but also fl uctuations in PaCO 2 are associated with severe IVH (Fabres et al. 2007 ) .",

First, it should be recognised that low PaCO 2 values are clearly more dangerous than moderately high values and that targeting mildly hypercapnic values decreases the risk of inadvertent hypocapnia. Second, it is important to avoid rapid changes in PaCO 2 . On balance, available evidence suggests that keeping PaCO 2 values in the range of 45-50 mmHg during the fi rst week of life is appropriate and safe. As a practical matter, because very preterm infants have a low renal threshold for bicarbonate and tend to have a modest metabolic acidosis, it is diffi cult to achieve signifi cant hypercapnia during the fi rst few days of life without unacceptable degree of acidosis. With time, the vulnerability of the brain to IVH decreases, and metabolic compensation develops, allowing PaCO 2 to rise to levels of 50-60 mmHg with relatively normal pH by the second and third week of life. Permissive hypercapnia with PaCO 2 values of 60-70 mmHg is widely practised and not clearly associated with adverse outcomes. The safety of this approach is in need of urgent study.",
