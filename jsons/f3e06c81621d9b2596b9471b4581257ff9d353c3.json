Subsequent investigations identified a novel coronavirus, now named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), from the affected patients. Highly sensitive and specific laboratory diagnostics are important for controlling the rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2-associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. In this study, we developed and compared the performance of three novel real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)/helicase (Hel), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) genes of SARS-CoV-2 with that of the reported RdRp-P2 assay, which is used in \u03fe30 European laboratories. Among the three novel assays, the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay had the lowest limit of detection in vitro (1.8 50% tissue culture infective doses [TCID 50 ]/ml with genomic RNA and 11.2 RNA copies/reaction with in vitro RNA transcripts). Among 273 specimens from 15 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Hong Kong, 77 (28.2%) were positive by both the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel and RdRp-P2 assays. The COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay was positive for an additional 42 RdRp-P2-negative specimens (119/ 273 [43.6%] versus 77/273 [28.2%]; P \u03fd 0.001), including 29/120 (24.2%) respiratory tract specimens and 13/153 (8.5%) non-respiratory tract specimens. The mean viral load of these specimens was 3.21 \u03eb 10 4 RNA copies/ml (range, 2.21 \u03eb 10 2 to 4.71 \u03eb 10 5 RNA copies/ml). The COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay did not cross-react with other human-pathogenic coronaviruses and respiratory pathogens in cell culture and clinical specimens, whereas the RdRp-P2 assay cross-reacted with SARS-CoV in cell culture. The highly sensitive and specific COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay may help to improve the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19.",

Subsequent investigations identified a novel coronavirus that was closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) from these patients (1) (2) (3) . This new virus has been recently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (4) . Most patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, or coronavirus disease 2019 , present with acute onset of fever, myalgia, cough, dyspnea, and radiological evidence of ground-glass lung opacities compatible with atypical pneumonia (5-7). However, asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases have also been reported (2, (8) (9) (10) . Initial epidemiological investigations have indicated the Huanan seafood wholesale market in Wuhan as a geographically linked source, but subsequent detailed epidemiological assessment has revealed that up to 45% of the early cases with symptom onset before 1 January 2020 were not linked to this market (5, 11) . Person-to-person transmissions among close family contacts and health care workers, including those without travel history to Wuhan, have been reported (2, 7, 12, 13) . Therefore, clinical features and epidemiological links to Wuhan alone are not reliable for establishing the diagnosis of COVID-19.",

The use of viral culture for establishing acute diagnosis is not practical, as it takes at least 3 days for SARS-CoV-2 to cause obvious cytopathic effects in selected cell lines, such as VeroE6 cells (3) . Moreover, isolation of the virus requires biosafety level 3 facilities, which are not available in most health care institutions. Serum antibody and antigen detection tests have not yet been validated, and there may be cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV, which shares a high degree (\u03f382%) of nucleotide identity with SARS-CoV-2 (17) . Because of these limitations, reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) remains the most useful laboratory diagnostic test for COVID-19 worldwide.",

The protocol of the first real-time RT-PCR assays targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) genes of SARS-CoV-2 were published on 23 January 2020 (20) . Among these assays, the RdRp assay had the highest analytical sensitivity (3.8 RNA copies/reaction at 95% detection probability) (20) . In this published RdRp assay, probe 1 was a \"pan Sarbeco-Probe\" which would detect SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and bat SARS-related coronaviruses, whereas probe 2 (termed \"RdRp-P2\" assay in the present study) was reported to be specific for SARS-CoV-2 and should not detect SARS-CoV (20) . Notably, these assays were designed and validated using synthetic nucleic acid technology and in the absence of available SARS-CoV-2 isolates or original patient specimens (20) . The reported RdRp assays had been implemented in \u03fe30 laboratories in Europe (21) . In this study, we developed novel, highly sensitive and specific real-time RT-PCR assays for COVID-19 and compared their performances with that of the established RdRp-P2 assay using both in vitro and patient specimens. Clinical evaluation using different types of clinical specimens from patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 showed that our novel assay targeting a different region of the RdRp/Hel was significantly more sensitive and specific than the RdRp-P2 assay.",

A total of 120 respiratory tract (nasopharyngeal aspirates/swabs, throat swabs, saliva, and sputum specimens) and 153 non-respiratory tract specimens (plasma and urine specimens and feces/rectal swabs) were collected from 15 patients with laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 in Hong Kong (positive nasopharyngeal aspirate/swab, throat swab, or sputum specimen by the RdRp-P2 assay). The median number of specimens collected per patient was 13. The 15 patients consisted of 8 males and 7 females. Their median age was 63 years (range, 37 to 75 years). All of them had clinical features compatible with acute community-acquired atypical pneumonia and radiological evidence of ground-glass lung opacities. At the time of writing this report, 11 patients were in stable condition, 3 were in critical condition, and 1 patient had succumbed. Among the 273 specimens collected from these 15 patients, 77 (28.2%) were positive by the RdRp-P2 assay ( Table 3 ). The novel COVID-2019-RdRp/Hel assay was positive for all of these 77 specimens. Additionally, the COVID-2019-RdRp/Hel assay was positive for another 42 specimens (119 positive specimens of 273 total specimens [43.6%] by COVID-2019-RdRp/Hel versus 77 positive specimens of 273 total specimens [28.2%] by RdRp-P2; P \u03fd 0.001), including 29/120 (24.2%) respiratory tract specimens and 13/153 (8.5%) non-respiratory tract specimens that were negative by the RdRp-P2 assay.

Like other betacoronaviruses, the SARS-CoV-2 genome is arranged in the order of 5=-replicase (ORF1a/b)-spike (S)envelope (E)-membrane (M)-nucleocapsid (N)-poly(A)-3= (17) . Traditionally, the preferred targets of coronavirus RT-PCR assays included the conserved and/or abundantly expressed genes such as the structural S and N genes and the nonstructural RdRp and replicase open reading frame (ORF) 1a/b genes (16, 28) . For COVID-19, the protocols of a number of RT-PCR assays used by different institutes have recently been made available online (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/ technical-guidance/laboratory-guidance). These assays target the ORF1a/b, ORF1b-nsp14, RdRp, S, E, or N gene of SARS-CoV-2, and some are nonspecific assays that would detect SARS-CoV-2 and other related betacoronaviruses such as SARS-CoV (20, 29) . Importantly, the in-use evaluation data of these assays using a large number of clinical specimens from patients with confirmed COVID-19 are lacking. In this study, we developed and evaluated three novel real-time RT-PCR assays that target different gene regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We showed that the novel COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay was highly sensitive and specific for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in vitro and in COVID-19 patient specimens. Among the three assays developed in this study, the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay has the lowest LOD with in vitro viral RNA transcripts (11.2 RNA copies/reaction; 95% confidence interval; 7.2 to 52.6 RNA copies/reaction). The LOD with genomic RNA was also very low (1.80 TCID 50 /ml). Importantly, the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay was significantly more sensitive (P \u0545 0.001) than the established RdRp-P2 assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in both respiratory tract and non-respiratory tract clinical specimens. The COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 42/273 (15.4%) additional specimens that tested negative by the RdRp-P2 assay. These findings are clinically and epidemiologically relevant, because asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases of COVID-19 have been increasingly recognized, and these patients with cryptic pneumonia may serve as a potential source for propagating the epidemic (2, 8) . Given the large number of patients (\u03fe60,000 cases in China at the time of writing) involved in this expanding epidemic, the additional positive specimens detected by the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay might translate into thousands of specimens that would otherwise be considered SARS-CoV-2 negative by the less-sensitive RdRp-P2 assay.",

False-negative results might arise from testing nasopharyngeal aspirate/swabs or throat swabs with low viral loads in COVID-19, SARS, and MERS patients (2, (30) (31) (32) (33) . RT-PCR assays with higher sensitivity, such as the COVID-19-RdRp/ Hel assay, might help to reduce the false-negative rate among these specimens which are frequently the only specimens available for establishing the diagnosis of COVID-19. We have previously shown that saliva has a high concordance rate with nasopharyngeal aspirates for the detection of influenza viral RNA and might also be a suitable specimen for diagnosing COVID-19 (22, 34) . The use of the highly sensitive COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay to test saliva specimens from suspected cases of COVID-19 might be a simple and rapid way to avoid the need of aerosol-generating procedures during collection of nasopharyngeal aspirates and suction of sputum, especially in regions most heavily affected by the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak where there are insufficient supplies of full personal protective equipment (13) . SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia has been reported in a small proportion of COVID-19 patients (2, 5) . However, as shown in our clinical evaluation in which the RdRp-P2 assay gave negative test results for all 10 plasma specimens that gave positive test results by the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay, the genuine incidence of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia might be underestimated by less sensitive RT-PCR assays. We have previously shown that high serum viral loads in SARS patients were associated with more severe disease as evidenced by a higher incidence of oxygen desaturation, need for mechanical ventilation, hepatic dysfunction, and death (35) . Thus, serial monitoring of the plasma viral load in COVID-19 patients with the highly sensitive COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay should be considered to provide prognostic insights and facilitate treatment decisions.",

Interestingly, our evaluation showed that the RdRp-P2 assay cross-reacted with SARS-CoV in vitro, which is different from what was previously reported (20) . We postulated that this might be due to the small number (n \u03ed 3) of nucleotide differences between the probe used in the RdRp-P2 assay with at least three strains of SARS-CoV (20) . This cross-reactivity would be especially important for laboratories in areas where SARS-CoV might reemerge and cocirculate with SARS-CoV-2, as the differences in clinical progression between SARS and COVID-19 remain incompletely understood at this stage.",

Nevertheless, our data showed that the newly established COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay was highly sensitive and specific for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in vitro and in respiratory and non-respiratory tract clinical specimens. The use of this novel RT-PCR assay might be especially useful for detecting COVID-19 cases with low viral loads and when testing upper respiratory tract, saliva, and plasma specimens from patients. Development of COVID-19-RdRp/Hel into a multiplex assay which can simultaneously detect other human-pathogenic coronaviruses and respiratory pathogens may further increase its clinical utility in the future. A U.S. provisional patent application (62/980,094) has been filed for the findings in this study (36) .",
