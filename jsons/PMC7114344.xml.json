            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration, leading to high mortality (up to 100%) in suckling piglets. PEDV was first discovered in the United Kingdom in 1971, and later was found in Belgium, Hungary, France, Italy, and the Czech Republic (Chasey and Cartwright, 1978, Fan et al., 2012). In 1986, PEDV was first reported in China, and proceeded to spread throughout Asia (Cui, 1990, Song and Park, 2012). In late 2010, a \u201cvariant\u201d PEDV strain with increased pathogenesis compared to the classical strains was reported in China, and is regarded as the first of the pandemic strains (Sun et al., 2012). Highly pathogenic PEDV was first detected in the United States (US) in April 2013, and rapidly spread to 31 states, as well as Mexico and Canada (Oka et al., 2014, Ojkic et al., 2015). In December 2013, a second PEDV strain OH851, initially called \u201cUS variant\u201d (later renamed S-INDEL), was detected in the US, which shared the same insertions and deletions in the S1 region as the classical PEDV strain, CV777 (Wang et al., 2014; EFSA AHAW Panel, 2014). The S-INDEL strains were reported with lower virulence in the field and were later identified in June 2013 upon a retroactive study (Vlasova et al., 2014). To date, the highly virulent PEDV has been reported in Colombia, Dominican Republic, Japan, Peru, Germany, Portugal, South Korea, and Ukraine (EFSA AHAW Panel, 2014; Lee and Lee, 2014, Hanke et al., 2015, Murakami et al., 2015, Mesquita et al., 2015).",

The PEDV genome is approximately 28 kb in length and roughly two-thirds of the genome consists of open reading frame (ORF) 1, which encodes 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) (Lai et al., 2013). These nsps play important roles in viral replication, post-translational processing, and immune evasion (Lai et al., 2013). The virus produces various structural proteins, including spike, membrane, and nucleocapsid (Lai et al., 2013). The spike protein is crucial to cell attachment and infection, and the envelope is an integral membrane protein, aiding in membrane fusion while the nucleocapsid protein is necessary for genomic packaging (Hagemeijer and de Haan, 2015). In addition, the PEDV genome includes ORF3, located between the spike and membrane genes, that encodes an ion channel protein possibly associated with PEDV pathogenesis (Park et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2012).",

For example, the spike gene codes for a viral attachment protein that can be divided into the S1 (1-789 aa) and S2 (790-1383 aa) regions (Song and Park, 2012). Comparative analysis of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) revealed two main antigenic sites in the S1 region: the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the C-terminal receptor binding domain (RBD) (Li et al., 2007). While both domains can influence virus infectivity, such as in TGEV, one domain tends to be central to a CoV\u2019s tropism: the NTD is important for MHV tropism, and the RBD is central to PEDV infectivity and virulence (Reguera et al., 2012). The NTD can bind to various sialic acids on the host cell surface (Reguera et al., 2012). The RBD contains residues that bind to the porcine aminopeptidase-N (pAPN), the host receptor utilized by TGEV and PEDV (Delmas et al., 1992).",

Higher entropy levels were present in the nsp2, nsp3, and S1 regions in both the nucleotide and amino acid alignments.

The analysis was run independently twice until convergence was reached, with high agreement between the two runs. In the concatenated alignment tree, the classical and pandemic Asian strains were positioned as basal to the US strains, consistent with an Asian origin for the US outbreak (Fig. 3\n). Importantly, the concatenated alignment tree suggests that the US epidemic may have resulted from two independent PEDV introductions into the US, including minor and major clade of viruses. The minor clade contained the American and European S-INDELs, and a small subclade of non S-INDEL sequences from the Ohio, including Ohio249/2014, PC21A/2013, and OH15962/2013. The major clade of US PEDV strains was supported by high posterior probability (100%) and appears to have diverged further into two highly supported sub-lineages (99% and 100% posterior probability). The phylogeny is consistent with multiple incursions of the major clade of US PEDV viruses into Mexico, Canada, and South Korea. The minor clade includes sequences from late 2013 to early 2014 that are localized to the midwestern and eastern US regions. The estimated tMRCA of the minor clade of US PEDV strains is July 2009\u20132011, and the estimated tMRCA of the major clade of US PEDV strains is September 2010\u2013August 2012.

Furthermore, the pandemic PEDV strains from China had an increased number of substitutions within the S1 domain when compared to the American strains due to the longer circulation time in China. Compared to the attenuated vaccine strain DR13, 29 of 185 (16%) American strains and 19 of 34 (56%) Asian strains had at least one amino acid substitution in the pAPN RBD (Table 2\n).

In the past, it was more economically and time effective to sequence smaller pieces of a genome and develop evolutionary conclusions from these relatively small genomic pieces. However, without full genomic sequences, it is impossible to compare variations within a genome to determine selective pressures on specific genes or regions. Because of NGS technology, tools like site-specific entropy analysis can be used to examine variability throughout the genome of many PEDV sequences. Sun and collaborators reported four regions of diversity within the PEDV genome, including V1 in the nsp2 and nsp3, V2 in the S1, V3 in the S2 and ORF3, and V4 in the nucleocapsid (Sun et al., 2015). While our results support the nucleotide variance in the nsp2, nsp3, and spike genes, high levels of diversity were not present in the S2, ORF3, and the nucleocapsid. This could be due to the omission of PEDV isolates in our analysis, as well as the comparatively large number of new US sequences in our dataset. Our variance results may more accurately represent variance within American PEDV strains, and underrepresent variance within Chinese strains.",

The functions of nsp2 and nsp3 remain relatively ambiguous. Despite being involved in viral growth and propagation, nsp2 is dispensable for viral replication because CoV strains can replicate in absence of the nsp2 (Graham et al., 2006). The function of nsp3 may be related to innate immune evasion since it encodes proteases that facilitate proteasome degradation, changes in intracellular destination, signaling, protein interactivity, and host type I interferon (IFN) antagonist activities (Xing et al., 2013). Due to the multifaceted nature of nsp3, other nsp regions could produce proteins with novel effects not yet understood that mediate the virulence of CoV species. Acquired nucleotide differences throughout the nsp2 and nsp3 regions could contribute to the evasion of host immunity. Thus, future research should focus on the functionality and importance of all PEDV genes to further understand CoV pathogenesis.",

US strains had a higher evolutionary rate compared to the global strains, but the Bayesian Skyline plot did not show any significant increase in evolutionary rate, possibly due to the lack of temporal sampling in the US dataset. The evolutionary rate for the spike gene was higher compared to the rest of the genome, reflecting greater selective pressure.

While the NTD spans a larger region of the S1 domain, it has not been directly linked to PEDV tropism and functionality, as in TGEV and MHV (Reguera et al., 2012). The Korean attenuated vaccine strain and the US strains share similar residues in the pAPN RBD, with numerous differences compared to the older classical strains, suggesting this vaccine may protect against the American strains. However, developing a consistently and longitudinally efficacious vaccine may prove challenging, considering the high evolutionary rate of the S1 region. Failures in the development of an efficacious vaccine have been reported, further supporting the difficulty in generating vaccines for PEDV (Li et al., 2014). Despite some uncertainties in vaccine efficacy, a recent study demonstrated that prior exposure of sows to the S-INDEL strain provided a level of protective immunity when their piglets were challenged with the more virulent original US PEDV strain, which is probably due to conservation within the C-terminal region of the viral genome (Goede et al., 2015).",
