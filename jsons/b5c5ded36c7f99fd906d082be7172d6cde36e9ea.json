The disease causes respiratory illness with symptoms such as cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty in breathing. . The COVID-19 family is causing thousands of deaths per day around the world. Even though this virus first started in Wuhan, China in December 2019, this dangerous virus is spreading around the world so quickly and more than 1.6 million people around 188 countries have been infected as of today when we write this article. Due to coronavirus, more than 100 thousand people have already died worldwide, and the number of new deaths has been increasing rapidly day by day. There is no treatment specifically approved for this virus so far. Thus, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 as a pandemic disease. The mutation of this virus moving faster than anything and more deadly too. This is one of the fastest progressive disease ever seen before [2] . Since it is a new type of virus and it changes formation quickly, there is no specific guideline for the assessment or examination process and proper treatment. According to findings from Wuhan, Hubei province in China, isolation of infected patients through home quarantining is the best way to protect people not already infected with this deadly virus [2] . Thus, patients with COVID-19 symptoms must remain isolated and wear masks when near others. For primary examination, a sample of nasopharyngeal exudate is taken to test reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by a chest X-ray. If the chest X-ray film is normal, then the patient can go home and take rest. If COVID-19 is confirmed, the patient must be admitted to a hospital. At the initial stages, COVID-19 affects both lungs, particularly the lower lobes, and especially the posterior segments, with a fundamentally peripheral and subpleural distribution. The chest CT is used for detecting COVID-19 in practically 50% of patients in the first two days. A researcher from Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China, has concluded that the CT should be used as the primary screening or diagnostic method to identify COVID-19.",

Hence, it is very difficult to pause the unexpected spreading of infection of COVID-19 diseases. By combining the clinical symptoms and signs, the chest computed tomography (CT) is a faster and easier approach to identify COVID-19 in clinical practices. According to doctors and researchers in China, CT image analysis is the key method to examine suspected patients for COVID-19 confirmation.",

It is also important for patient prognosis, control of this epidemic, and public health security. As the rate of newly affected global regions is increasing every day, and the number of new patients is increasing geometrically in those areas, it has become a difficult or sometimes impossible task to provide necessary treatment for them [3, 4, 5] . Hence, the availability of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system can be helpful to identify the COVID-19 patients quickly and accurately using X-ray and CT images as shown in Figure 1 . The main motivation of this research is accurate and faster detection of COVID-19 patients as it is very important for the prevention and control of this pandemic. Most importantly, it can protect human lives around the world. We also present deep learning-based radiology image analysis methods that could provide state-of-the-art testing accuracy by far compared to existing methods [6] . Recently, several Deep Learning (DL) based methods have been presented and shown to be highly accurate for COVID-19 detection from CT images [7, 12, 17] . In this study, we apply advanced deep learning methods to investigate both X-ray and CT manifestations of coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia. These include classification and segmentation models for analysis of samples from two different modalities for detection and localization. For chest X-ray image analysis, due to the scarcity of publicly available COVID-19 X-ray samples, we have trained our model with a pneumonia dataset, and then utilized a Transfer Learning (TL) method for retraining with samples of COVID-19.

A literature review was published recently in [9] and claimed that the ground-glass and consolidative opacities on CT are sometimes undetectable on chest radiography. The study has also suggested that CT is a more sensitive modality of medical imaging. The COVID-19 infection pulmonary manifestation is predominantly characterized by ground-glass opacification with occasional consolidation on CT. The pros and cons of using X-ray and CT image analysis and its effectiveness for the screening of COVID-19 patients were explained in recent studies. In most of the cases, chest X-ray is considered as the primary screening method. In cases of patients without predominant disease, COVID-19 can be defined by chest X-ray. Otherwise the CT was recommended for determining COVID-19 infection. Another study demonstrated that chest CT has a pivotal role for the diagnosis and assessment of lung involvement in COVID-19 pneumonia [10] . CT plays a central role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and the decision has been taken by conducting an evaluation with 366 CT scans which were reviewed by two groups of radiologists. The objective of this study was to define disease progression and recovery of the illness and found that the peak period during illness were days 6-11 [11] . The performance of the radiologists has been analyzed and observed that the radiologist has high specificity but moderate sensitivity in differentiating COVID-19 from viral pneumonia on CT scan [12] . For COVID-19 detection, a CT scan image analysis method found that in 20 (56%) patients out of 36 patients about 2 days after symptom onset had normal [13] . Furthermore, for critical cases, images from both modalities are recommended for decision making.",

A DL based method has been proposed for COVID-19 detection from chest X-ray which was named COVID-19 Detection Neural Network (COVNet). The ReseNet50 was used as the backbone for COVNet. This model was tested on 4356 chest CTs from 3322 patients and it showed 0.96 and 0.95 scores for Area Under Curve and community acquired pneumonia (CAP) score respectively [14] . The study also demonstrated CT findings and compared for asymptomatic and symptomatic patients for COVID-19 detection and the results showed that there were no significant differences in age, sex distribution, or comorbidities for symptomatic and asymptomatic cases [14] . One of the most relevant and recent models, COVID-Net [15] ], used a deep neural network with high architectural diversity and selective long-range connectivity. This model experimented on two open access data repositories, one for COVID-19 detection dataset and another for pneumonia detection dataset. The experimental results showed around 83.5% testing accuracy. In this case, both databases were merged for performing training and testing of the proposed method [15] . However, in our proposed approach, we have trained a model with a pneumonia dataset and used Transfer Learning (TL) for training the same model with a COVID-19 dataset.",

After segmenting the lung region from CT images, mathematical morphological operations were performed to refine the segmentation masks. Lung regions were then extracted with respect to the mask.

In addition, most of the COVID-19 infected region detection methods proposed are based on patch-based detection methods for infected region extraction, where there is a big possibility to have false positive and false negative detections as the decision is taken based on the class [17] . On the other hand, we proposed an infected region segmentation strategy with pixel level analysis.

Second, as the COVID-Det_CT model is trained and tested on only 300 samples in the initial implementation, the model provides very good detection accuracy. From our point of view, the COVID-Det_CT model needs to be trained and tested with more samples to generalize and make the model more robust and accurate.

The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function is used all through the network in this implementation. At the end, a 1\u00d71 convolutional layer is used to reduce the dimension of the feature maps to the single channel outputs with a sigmoid activation function. In addition, we have utilized the up-sampled feature maps from 3 different encoding layers including the bottleneck layer. Therefore, we named the model NABLA-3 network.
