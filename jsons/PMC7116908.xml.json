            "text": "In general, synonymous codons are not used equally in inter-genome and different genomes have their own characteristic patterns of synonymous codon usage (Grantham et al., 1980, Nakamura et al., 1991). In Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Dictyostelium discoideum (Bulmer, 1988, Sharp et al., 1993), Drosophila melanogaster (Shields et al., 1988) and Caenorhabditis elegans (Stenico et al., 1994), compositional constraints and translational selection have been found to be the main factors accounting for codon usage variation among genes. However, in some genome with extremely high A + T or G + C contents (Karlin and Mrazek, 1996, Sharp et al., 1993, Zhao et al., 2007, Zhong et al., 2007), mutation bias is the major factor accounting for the variation in codon usage. Recently, codon usage was suggested to be related to gene function (Fuglsang, 2003, Liu et al., 2005, Ma et al., 2002b) and protein secondary structure (Griswold et al., 2003, Kahali et al., 2007, Ma et al., 2002a).",

            "text": "Codon usage information has also been analyzed in different viruses. For example, a survey of the patterns of synonymous codon preference in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reveals that HIV has a marked codon usage bias due to its strong preference for the A nucleotide (Chou and Zhang, 1992). It was also found that codon usage appears to be simply a consequence of uneven base composition in nucleopolyhedroviruses (Levin and Whittome, 2000). Moreover, in Mimivirus genes, codon usage bias is dictated both by mutational pressure and translational selection, and evidences show that four factors such as mean molecular weight (MMW), hydropathy, aromaticity and cysteine content are mostly responsible for the variation of amino acid usage in Mimivirus proteins (Sau et al., 2006). Some published studies are mostly restricted to particular groups of viruses and have usually addressed phylogenetic questions (Berkhout et al., 2002, Gu et al., 2004, Zhou et al., 2005). In 2005, a research on coding sequences of RNA viruses and their genome polarity showed that positive-stranded RNA viruses have significantly higher GC contents than negative-stranded RNA viruses. Coding sequences of all negative-stranded RNA viruses are biased toward high A in coding strands (high T in genomes) (Auewarakul, 2005). A recent study showed that genome-wide mutational pressure, rather than natural selection for specific coding triplets, is the main determinant of codon usage in vertebrate-infecting DNA viruses (Shackelton et al., 2006). Studies of the synonymous codon usage in viruses can reveal information about the molecular evolution of individual genes and such information would be relevant to understanding the regulation of viral gene expression and also to vaccine design where the efficient expression of viral proteins may be required to generate immunity (Hassard and Ward, 1995, Jenkins and Holmes, 2003).",

            "text": "In 2005, applying molecular methods, a novel respiratory virus has been discovered in children with respiratory tract infections in Sweden and was subsequently named Human Bocavirus (HBoV) (Allander et al., 2005). Phylogenetic analyses of the complete genome of HBoV revealed that the virus is most closely related to canine minute virus and bovine parvovirus, which are members of the Bocavirus genus of the Parvoviridae family (Allander et al., 2005). The genome of parvovirus consists of two major ORFs encoding a nonstructural protein (NS1) and at least two capsid proteins (VP1 and VP2), respectively. Moreover, HBoV also has a third middle ORF encoding a nonstructural protein (NP1) of unknown function (Allander et al., 2005). HBoV is currently being detected in patients with respiratory disease in several countries, suggesting that HBoV may be circulating worldwide (Bastien et al., 2006, Phillips et al., 1987, Simon et al., 2007). The relative importance of HBoV on viral respiratory tract illnesses is still not known, but it has been associated with respiratory illnesses ranging from upper respiratory tract disease (24%) to severe bronchiolitis (11\u201326%) and pneumonia (17\u201333%) (Bastien et al., 2006, Bastien et al., 2007, Phillips et al., 1987). Preliminary reports also have suggested that the HBoV detection rate in children with respiratory tract infection at approximately 1.5\u201318.3% and it seems that this virus is associated with respiratory tract illness in patients, especially in infants and young children (Fryxell and Zuckerkandl, 2000, Ma et al., 2006, Sloots et al., 2006, Weissbrich et al., 2006).",

Secondly, for each gene, actual codon bias was plotted against both GC3S and the expected ENC value, if codon usage bias is solely due to biased base composition (i.e. G + C content). Result showed that the actual codon usage indices are close to the values expected from their G + C composition, although all are slightly lower (Fig. 2\n). Thirdly, we plotted the first and second axis values in COA and GC3S values of each strains (Fig. 3\n). The patterns of codon usage in different genes also appear to be closely related to the GC content on the third codon position. Correlation analysis has been implemented to each gene to find some correlation between synonymous codon usage and nucleotide compositions. We also found that axis 1 coordinates are correlated with GC3S and GC (r\n = \u22120.918, P\n < 0.01; r\n = \u22120.585, P\n < 0.01), while there is a significant correlation between axis 2 value and GC3S (r\n = 0.366, P\n < 0.05).

Because the closeness of any two genes on this value reflects the similarities of their codon usages, synonymous codon usage bias appears to be conservative between genes that are functionally closely related (Zhou et al., 2005). To detect whether gene function were correlated with the observed variation in codon bias, all genes were grouped into several classes according to gene function. Because most of these viruses contain genes coding for a nonstructural protein (NS1), two capsid proteins (VP1 and VP2), respectively, and also a third middle ORF encoding a nonstructural protein (NP1) of unknown function, these four gene groups were selected to find whether there is a correlation between codon usage and gene function. The average ENC value and its corresponding S.D. value of each group were calculated (Fig. 4\n). The S.D. values of NS1, VP1, VP2 and NP1 groups were all slight. A one-tailed t-test was then performed on ENC values and values of both axes1 and axes 2 in COA of these genes with the hypothesis that there is no correlation between codon usage bias and gene function (t-test, P-value < 10\u22123).

This once again testified to the conclusion that genes with similar functions also display similar codon usage bias.",

In this study, evidence suggests that synonymous codon usage bias in HBoV was less biased, which was mainly determined by the base compositions on the third codon position. As a case in point, the values of ENC vary from 40.87 to 48.42 (S.D. = 2.89) and the GC3S values range from 29% to 40% (S.D. = 0.04). The average ENC value of 44.45 among 44 genes can be compared to those seen in other organisms such as H5N1 virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus (SARSCoV), Porcine adenovirus, Orgyia pseudotsugata multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (OpMNPV) and Lymantria dispar multinucleocapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus (LdMNPV), where mean values of 50.91, 48.99, 38.97, 38.80 and 35.90, respectively, have been reported (Das et al., 2006, Gu et al., 2004, Levin and Whittome, 2000, Zhou et al., 2005). Therefore, taken together with published data of codon usage bias among some other viruses, we could conclude that codon usage bias in HBoV genes is less biased.",

In 2005, in order to understand the common features and differences among viruses, some sequenced vertebrate-infecting DNA viruses were analyzed. This research revealed that patterns of codon usage bias are strongly correlated with overall genomic GC content, suggesting that genome-wide mutational pressure, rather than natural selection for specific coding triplets, is the main determinant of codon usage (Shackelton et al., 2006). But in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii genome (Naya et al., 2001) which had high GC contents, there was no evidence that the genome composition shaped the codon usages of genes. In this study, the general association between codon usage bias and base composition suggests that mutational pressure, rather than natural selection is the main factor that determines the codon usage bias in HBoV, which is also supported by the highly significant correlation between GC12 and GC3S (r\n = \u22120.837, P\n < 0.05), and the result of ENC-plot (Fig. 2). A similar pattern of codon usage has been reported amongst some viruses (Das et al., 2006, Jenkins and Holmes, 2003, Levin and Whittome, 2000, Shackelton et al., 2006, Zhao et al., 2003). Therefore, mutational bias is the major factor responsible for the variation of synonymous codon usage among genes in these virus genomes.",

These analyses indicated the NS/NP1 gene are the most conserved regions and thus, will not demonstrate differences between HBoV isolates; most variations of nucleotide sequences appeared in the VP1/VP2 gene encoding the capsid protein and the variation between HBoV isolates does not depend on geographical location. In this study, cluster analyses based on the RSUC values of the 44 HBoV genes examined were carried out using a hierarchical cluster method. The result indicated that gene's function is the dominant factor that determines the result of cluster analysis and suggests that the cluster pattern of HBoV does not correlate with geographic variation.

But clearly, a more comprehensive analysis is needed to reveal the true extent of codon usage bias variation within and among HBoV isolates and what other factors are responsible, including the influence of factors such as cell tropism, principal host species, method of transmission, and viral genetic structure. Such information would then allow us to judge more precisely the relative importance of mutation pressure versus natural selection in determining base composition and codon usage in these pathogens (Jenkins et al., 2001).",
