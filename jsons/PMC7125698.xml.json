            "text": "RNA secondary structure analysis has been an important task in molecular biology throughout the recent years. Computational structure prediction based on a thermodynamic model has been around since the first version of the Mfold program (Zuker and Stiegler, 1981) became available. Both the program and the model have been refined several times. In the Vienna RNA package (Hofacker et al., 1994, Hofacker, 2003) RNAfold provides an alternative implementations of the same model, with a wide spectrum of additional features. Based on dynamic programming algorithms, these programs perform a complete evaluation of all feasible structures for a given RNA sequence, and determine the one with minimal free energy. Therefore, this approach is called MFE folding, for short. The widespread use of these programs demonstrates that the research community has learned to live with the shortcomings of MFE folding, which are well known:(1)The MFE structure is not guaranteed to be the native one. For sequences longer than (say) 400 bases, it will almost surely be wrong. On the other hand, it will also contain some correct structural elements \u2013 given just the MFE structure and no additional clues, we do not know which parts of the prediction are good. And also, the native structure is typically a member of the near-optimal folding space, but again, we do not know which one.(2)For reasons of computational complexity, standard folding programs disregard pseudoknots, which are an important structural feature. Since the pseudoknots are not contained in the folding space evaluated by the programs at all, they cannot be found among the near-optimals either.(3)Better results can be obtained with a comparative approach, using the fact that structure is conserved more than sequence with homologous RNA molecules that share the same function. When a large number of well-aligned sequences is available, statistical methods yield good results (Doshi et al., 2004). When only a few sequences are given, and when their alignment is difficult, much more sophisticated methods are required.(4)RNA molecules do not fold in isolation, and contacts with proteins or other RNA molecules may play an important role. Furthermore, RNA\u2013RNA interaction is guided by the same thermodynamics as is the self-interaction that creates the structure of a single sequence, but its correct modeling again requires specialized approaches.\n",

            "text": "A large number of contributions has been made addressing the above problems. We only list a few for each category, adding in the ones to be presented below in the appropriate place:(1)The fact that the truth may lie buried in the near-optimal folding space has prompted researchers to augment their folding programs to also compute near-optimal structures. There are basically three approaches: Mfold provides a heuristic sample of near-optimal structures, taking care that the structures produced are not too similar. RNAsubopt (Wuchty et al., 1998) produces a complete account of the near-optimal folding space up to a certain energy threshold. In the first case, we do not know if an \u201cinteresting\u201d structure is overlooked in the heuristic example, in the second case, we are confronted with a large number of structures, as the near-optimal folding space grows exponentially with sequence length as well with the allowed energy interval. Sfold (Ding and Lawrence, 2003) samples structures according to their probabilities derived from Boltzmann statistics. A sample size of 1000 structures is usually sufficient for good results. With subsequent clustering of the sampled structures according to structural similarity, a small number of centroids can be returned that can be taken as a representative ensemble of potentially relevant structures (Ding et al., 2005). The MFE structure is not guaranteed to be contained in the sample, but can be easily added by traditional methods. This approach comes close to a complete, non-heuristic and yet useful (because of the compact result) analysis of the folding space. A more direct way to achieve the same goal is chosen by the program RNAshapes (Giegerich et al., 2004b), to be presented below. Here the folding space is subdivided into families of structures that share the same abstract shape, and for each family, a representative structure is determined.(2)The problem of pseudoknots has been widely studied, as it is also of great theoretical interest. The general case has been proved to be an NP-hard problem (Lyngs\u00f8 and Pedersen, 2001, Akutsu, 2000), and hence computationally intractable. Some researchers have abandoned the thermodynamic model and resorted to graph algorithms or genetic algorithms (Tabaska et al., 1998, Shapiro and Navetta, 1994). The program pknots by Rivas and Eddy (1999) implements thermodynamic folding of a rather large subclass of pseudoknots in O(n\n6) time and O(n\n4) space, which implies that it can be used only for very short sequences. The program pknotsRG, to be presented below, restricts the class of pseudoknots further, but still recognizes many pseudoknots arising in practice, and runs in O(n\n4) time and O(n\n2) space. A filtering approach has recently be presented (Huang et al., 2005) that combines a pre-filter with the folding programs, which sometimes substantially gains in efficiency.(3)Comparative structure prediction from unaligned sequences must solve the task of simultaneous alignment and thermodynamic folding with a combined objective function to be optimized. As multiple sequence alignment under the common sum-of-pairs score by itself is NP-complete (Wang and Jiang, 1994), one cannot hope to obtain an efficient non-heuristic algorithm. The Sankoff algorithm (Sankoff, 1985), which gives the exact solution to this problem, has hence served as a source of derived approaches, for example, DNYALIGN (Mathews and Turner, 2002) and FOLDALIGN (Gorodkin et al., 1997). These programs must make severe restrictions to the underlying model to achieve practical runtime. Even so, the results are often quite moderate; see (Gardner and Giegerich, 2004) for a recent survey. In this situation, the recent tool RNAforester (H\u00f6chsmann et al., 2003, H\u00f6chsmann et al., 2004), which allows for a meaningful way of aligning structures directly (without use of a sequence alignment), has opened a new road that circumvents the dilemma of the Sankoff approach. The program RNAcast (Reeder and Giegerich, 2005) efficiently determines the consensus shapes of a set of sequences, and from their representative structures, a multiple alignment can be obtained with RNAforester. Both RNAforester and RNAcast are described below.(4)When the sites are known where RNA molecules interact with other molecules, this can be incorporated into the folding algorithms. The aforementioned folding programs provide options to specify that a certain base must pair or should not pair. Although such information can be obtained by experimental or comparative methods, most often it is not available. General RNA\u2013RNA interaction has been recently studied by Andronescu et al. (2005). A special case of great current interest is the interaction between a miRNA or a siRNA with its target RNA. As this process is guided by thermodynamics, early approaches have modeled this situation by linking the small RNA to the end of its target, and then folding them jointly with a standard folding program (Stark et al., 2003) As this approach tends to produce artefacts, a proper model of hybridizing a small RNA to a larger target has been developed and implemented in the program RNAhybrid. This program, already widely used for miRNA and siRNA target prediction, is presented below.\n",

            "text": "Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are one of the best analyzed RNA families. Various experiments have revealed the biological active structure of tRNAs which is known as the cloverleaf structure. In contrast to this we found that out of 99 tRNA sequences from the Rfam database (Griffiths-Jones et al., 2003), only 30 have a cloverleaf as their predicted MFE structure (data not shown). The biological explanation for this is that tRNAs possess modified bases which may on the one hand be no longer capable of forming base pairs, or on the other hand are able to interact in a different way. This alters the free energy of the predicted conformation such that it rises above the free energy of the cloverleaf (or vice versa), letting the latter achieve the energetical optimum. For structure prediction, when the modifications are unknown, current practice is to calculate suboptimal structures for a certain energy range and to subsequently search (by eye or by a simple pattern matching algorithm) for the cloverleaf structure in the list of suboptimals. For tRNAs this means that about 50\u2013300 structures have to be checked. To give an example we chose the Natronobacterium pharaonis tRNA for alanine (gb: AB003409.1/96-167). The predicted MFE structure is one hairpin with three internal loops, as depicted in Fig. 2\n(a). The cloverleaf structure, shown in Fig. 2(c) appears at position 104 in the energy sorted list of 199 suboptimals, produced by RNAsubopt. Using RNAshapes, we obtain three shapes in an energy range of 5 kcal/mol above the MFE, of which the rank 3 shrep is the cloverleaf structure. Furthermore, the probabilities indicate that without the aforementioned modifications it is highly unlikely that this tRNA attains the cloverleaf shape. The output of RNAshapes and the squiggle plots for the shreps are shown in Fig. 2.",

Determining the secondary structure by comparative methods usually gives better results than methods based on only one sequence. The best results were achieved by statistical analysis of covariation and sequence conservation within a RNA family (Gutell et al., 1992). However, these methods need a large family and a very good, hand crafted alignment. For the comparative analysis of only a few related RNAs, the algorithm formulated by Sankoff (1985) is thought to be the ideal approach. It simultaneously aligns and folds a set of RNA sequences. Unfortunately, this method is exponential in the number of sequences and practical only for two sequences of moderate length. An intrinsic reason why the Sankoff algorithm is so expensive is the implicit multiple sequence alignment. The key to a practical, yet non-heuristic algorithm for consensus prediction is to find the consensus without constructing a sequence alignment. If desired, an alignment can be derived from the consensus afterwards with a structural alignment program, such as RNAforester.",

The sizes of bulge loops and internal loops can be restricted if from the nature of the RNA/RNA interaction this appears reasonable. This can be the case, for example, in the prediction of microRNA targets in plants, where microRNAs usually bind nearly perfectly to the target, the hybridizations showing only small loops of 1 nucleotide, if any. As a further refinement, hybridizations can be forced to have uninterrupted base pairing for specified regions, for example from nucleotide 2 to nucleotide 7 in the microRNA.
