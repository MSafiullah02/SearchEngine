The latter implicate, in the authors opinion, that each researcher working with the molecular epidemiology of infectious disease should have knowledge about the actual situation in the field, which will certainly help to avoid the proposal of wrong hypotheses. It is equally important to be aware that most of the techniques used, e.g. phylogenetic analysis or selection pressure analysis, are by themselves based on hypotheses and models, with their intrinsic assumptions, biases and fuzziness. Furthermore, there should be a general awareness about the illusion that we, particularly with the derived nucleotide sequence information, have knowledge about the viral genetics. Beside the quasispecies structure of the RNA virus populations, there are manifold possibilities of virus-host interactions we still do not understand.",

            "text": "The first indication of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in the literature can be found in a book from the Italian physician Hieronymi Fracastorii (Wright, 1930) , where he describes a cattle disease similar to the signs of FMD. Since then, several indications of FMD can be found in the literature (Thalmann and Nockler, 2001) . From the second half of the 19th century, on the account of the increase of animal trade due to the development of new transport routes (O'Rourke and Williamson, 2002) , the disease became more important and started to cause severe economic losses. In Germany, in 1897, a commission had been set up by the Prussian Ministry of Culture, following a request from the ''Partei der Landwirte'' of the Reichstag to set up measures of FMD control (Rott and Siddell, 1998) . One year later, Friedrich Loeffler and Paul Frosch wrote in their report that the causative agent of FMD was neither a known bacterium nor a toxin but an ''ultravisible, ultrafilterable substance'' (Loeffler and Frosch, 1897) , and described thereby the first animal virus, foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). In 1910, the first FMD research institute was built on the island of Riems in Germany, followed by other research institutes in Europe, e.g. in Pirbright, United Kingdom in 1925 and on Lindholm island, Denmark in 1926. The major milestones in these early years of FMD research were the introduction of guinea pigs as research animals (Waldmann and Pape, 1920) and the first steps towards the development of an FMD vaccine in 1937 (Waldmann et al., 1937) .",

            "text": "The causative agent of FMD is the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), a small positive sense ssRNA virus (approx. 8.3 kb) which belongs to the Aphthovirus genus of the family Picornaviridae (Belsham, 1993) . FMDV replicates through negative strand RNA which was recently used in quantitative strand specific real time RT-PCR as a tool to determine strain virulence and replication patterns (Horsington and Zhang, 2007) . The high genetic and phenotypic variability of FMDV is reflected in the existence of seven serotypes: O, A, C, Asia 1, SAT 1, SAT 2 and SAT 3 and further numerous variants and lineages, described as topotypes (Knowles and Samuel, 2003) . The antigenic diversity within the serotypes is crucial to consider when selecting vaccine strains, as crossreactivity may be variable (Kitching, 2005) . The virus capsid is composed of 60 copies of each of the four structural polypeptides designated VP1 to VP4. A region in the G-H loop (around residues 140-160) of the VP1 protein exposed on the surface of the viral capsid was determined to be the main antigenic site recognized by neutralizing antibodies (Bittle et al., 1982) . The natural FMDV infection is initiated when the RGD motif within the G-H loop binds to certain cellular integrin receptors, which are expressed in the epithelial cells targeted during the acute phase of infection (Alexandersen et al., 2003b; Monaghan et al., 2005) . In the process of cell culture adaptation, FMDV acquire the ability to use other receptors like glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which do not require the RGD motif. The host specificity to natural FMDV infection is thought to depend on FMDV binding to specific integrins although there are some other, yet undiscovered, mechanisms which determine FMDV susceptibility.",

The site of penetration is influenced by droplet size, since only the smallest inhaled droplets reaching the alveoli of the lungs. Initial infection occurs predominantly at the epithelial surface of the soft palate and adjacent nasopharynx, with subsequent spread of virus through regional lymph nodes (Alexandersen et al., 2003a; Donaldson et al., 1987) .

            "text": "1. Spontaneous mutation: RNA virus encoded RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase lacks the 3 0 !5 0 exonuclease activity (proofreading activity), leading to a very high mutation rate (approx. one mutation per genome per replication (Drake, 1993) . These viruses have adapted their genome size to the so called error threshold (maximum mutation rate, tolerable for a genome size) to avoid fitness loss Eigen, 2005, 2006; Bull et al., 2005; Escarmis et al., 2006; Gonzalez-Lopez et al., 2005; Sole et al., 2006) . 2. The phenomenon of spontaneous mutation leads to a statistical effect called genetic drift. For an extremely large, highly diverse population, the ratio of highly fit to less fit genotypes may be very small. During a transmission event, only a few particles might be transmitted. Those genotypes do not represent the full genetic or fitness distribution of the original population and therefore often do not include the highly fit genotypes, because of their comparatively small numbers. The outcome is a new population established in a similar environment but with members of a small, less fit (on average) class of viruses (Knipe et al., 2006) . FMDV is thought to evolve mainly through genetic drift, due to the high error-prone nature of its RNA polymerase (Domingo et al., 2005a,c) . The FMDV RNA transcription error frequencies are estimated to vary between 10 \u00c03 and 10 \u00c05 nucleotide misincorporations per site per replication cycle (Haydon et al., 2004) . 3. Recombination: Recombination describes a process in which the fragments of nucleic acid sequences from two genotypically different parental viruses are exchanged so that the progeny contain sequences derived from both parental viruses. Inter alia picornaviruses, coronaviruses and togaviruses display efficient recombination, which probably occurs during replication via ''copy choice'' (Enami et al., 1989; Jarvis and Kirkegaard, 1992; Kirkegaard and Baltimore, 1986; Kuge et al., 1989; Meier et al., 1984) . Recombination seems to play an important role in FMDV evolution and occurs mainly in the gene regions coding for the non-structural proteins (Carrillo et al., 2005; Domingo et al., 2003; Jackson et al., 2007; Klein et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2009 ), but also sometimes in the gene regions coding for the structural proteins (Haydon et al., 2004; Haydon and Woolhouse, 1998; Tosh et al., 2002b) . Changes in the non-structural proteins may potentially modify the virulence of the virus (Klein et al., 2007) . The evolution of the structural proteins, especially VP1, which plays a major role in virus entry, seems to be mainly shaped by genetic drift (Domingo et al., 2005b,c; Domingo, 2006) .",

This also applies within a single infected host, where different virus variants sometimes can be isolated from different tissues, reflecting the adaptation of quasispecies (Domingo et al., 2005a (Domingo et al., ,b,c, 2003 . This means that single host populations will compete with new, different virus genotypes for the limited number of susceptible host cells; which may lead to an increase in virulence. The virus strain with the higher basic reproductive rate will overtake the less-virulent, but finally end in a stage of equilibrium (Alexopoulou and Dourakis, 2005; Mao et al., 2001; Miralles et al., 1999; Sitia et al., 2001) . Evolution experiments in vitro (Domingo et al., 2002; Domingo et al., 2005a,b,c; Martinez et al., 1992 Martinez et al., , 1991 Martinez et al., , 1997 Villaverde et al., 1991 ) demonstrate FMDV's capability of survival, despite accumulation of mutations upon repeated bottleneck events (where population size is greatly reduced by a catastrophe). Therefore, a range of mutation rate must have evolved to ensure a continuous heterogeneity to find population subsets that can invade cells after bottleneck events and staying below the errorthreshold. This can be exemplified by the RGDLXXL motif in the highly variable GH loop of VP1. This motif is responsible for receptor recognition (avb6) and is invariant in most field isolates, even after bottleneck events like the introduction of vaccination (Monaghan et al., 2005) .",

However, this lineage was used at the nearby Pirbright laboratory site, which houses separate units of the Institute for Animal Health and Merial Animal Health Ltd and it was soon clear that this was the origin of the virus. Thus, the question arose from which unit the virus escaped. Full length genome sequencing of the virus isolates obtained from infected animals have shown typical amino acid adaptations for FMDV propagated for several passages in cell culture systems, as used in vaccine production, and Merial Animal Health Ltd. was identified as the source of the outbreak (Cottam et al., 2008) .",
