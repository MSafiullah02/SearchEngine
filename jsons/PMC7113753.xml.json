            "text": "Discovered in the 1970s, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a coronavirus that causes severe agricultural loss (Chasey and Cartwright, 1978; Lee, 2015). PEDV infects the intestinal tract and causes diarrhea and vomiting in older pigs. The mortality of PEDV-infected piglets can reach 100% due to extreme dehydration (Stevenson et al., 2013). Recently, modified live attenuated vaccines for PEDV genogroup 1 has been an important way to control the spreading of PEDV in Asia (Song and Park, 2012). In 2013, a new vaccine-resistant PEDV strain, appeared in the USA (Stevenson et al., 2013). Since then, this new USA PEDV strain, which was later assigned to genogroup 2a, has caused a continuous pandemic in North America, Europe and Asia (Huang et al., 2013; Song et al., 2015). The resistance of the new PEDV strain to the conventional vaccine highlights the issue that although vaccination is a powerful strategy, it can still fail due to the genetic diversity of epitopes between genogroups. As a result, it is necessary to develop another antiviral strategy for PEDV.",

            "text": "Unlike two other highly pathogenic human CoVs, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which belong to the beta group, PEDV belongs to the alpha group (Chan et al., 2015). Like other CoVs, PEDV depends on its own proteases, including main protease (Mpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) to cleave the polyprotein, and alpha CoVs have both papain-like protease 1 (PL1pro) and papain-like protease 2 (PL2pro) (Lee, 2015; Wojdyla et al., 2010). Polyprotein cleavage is required for viral maturation and thus these proteases are ideal antiviral targets (Bacha et al., 2008; Cheng et al., 2015; Chou et al., 2008; Kumar et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2018; Park et al., 2012; Ratia et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2006). Furthermore, in contrast to highly variable spike proteins targeted by antibodies (Li et al., 2005, 2017; Wang et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2009), proteases with more conserved structure and catalytic function may serve as a general target across different CoVs (Anand et al., 2003; Bailey-Elkin et al., 2014; Chou et al., 2014; Ho et al., 2015; Ratia et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2003).",

The latter three domains form a catalytic core and may retain catalytic activity, like that of SARS- and MERS-CoV PLpros (Chou et al., 2012; Clasman et al., 2017; Lei et al., 2014). In the present study, we made a recombinant catalytic core PEDV PL2pro and demonstrated its secondary, tertiary and quaternary structural characteristics. Further studies suggest that PEDV PL2pro exhibits much higher DUB activity than that of SARS- and MERS-CoV PLpros and can be inhibited by the anti-leukemia drug 6-thioguanine (6TG). 6TG has been found to be able to inhibit multiple DUB enzymes including human USP2 as well as SARS- and MERS-CoV PLpros (Chen et al., 2009; Cheng et al., 2015; Chou et al., 2008; Chuang et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2018). Inhibition assays and docking simulations were used to clarify the detailed inhibition mechanism of 6TG against PEDV PL2pro. Our findings increase understanding of the structure and catalytic activity of PEDV PL2pro and identify the first potent inhibitor against this enzyme.",

Previous studies suggested that the Ubl domain was not involved in the catalytic activity of SARS- and MERS-CoV PLpros (Chou et al., 2012; Clasman et al., 2017).

After further purification using size-exclusion chromatography, highly pure PL2pro was obtained (Fig. S2, left panel, lane 6). Mass spectrometry was performed to identify the sequence of the recombinant protein. In total, 19 peptides originating from PEDV PL2pro were identified (Fig. S2, right panel).

Furthermore, sequence alignment indicates that PEDV PL2pro may also have a zinc fingers motif like other coronaviral PLpros (Fig. S1, green ovals) (Bailey-Elkin et al., 2014; Lei et al., 2014; Ratia et al., 2006; Wojdyla et al., 2010). Previous studies have shown that the DUB activity of coronaviral PLpros can be inhibited by the addition of a chelator like EDTA, which removes intrinsic zinc ions (Chou et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2014). In line with our expectations, inhibition of PEDV PL2pro by EDTA displays a similar dose-dependent pattern, suggesting that the removal of endogenous metal ions can inhibit PEDV PL2pro (Fig. 1). Furthermore, like other coronaviral PLpros, PEDV PL2pro can be inhibited by adding extra external zinc ions (Chou et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2014).",

            "text": "In addition, the proteolytic activity of PEDV PL2pro was investigated using fluorogenic peptidyl substrates (Table 1\n). For comparison, we used a peptidyl substrate with a sequence matching the P6 to P1 residues of the cleavage site of SARS-CoV PLpro, FRLKGG, and a peptidyl substrate optimized for PEDV PL2pro whose cleavage site P6 to P1 residues are FKKKGG, based on the non-structural protein (nsp) 2 to 3 cleavage site (from GenBank accession number AHC03501.1). Interestingly, less saturation was observed while using the optimized peptidyl substrate (Fig. S5A). We failed to improve it due to the fact that the proteolytic activity at concentrations of substrate higher than 50 \u03bcM cannot be appropriately measured because of the inner-filter effect. After fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation, Km of 18.6 \u03bcM and kcat of 0.065 min\u22121 for the SARS-CoV-derived substrate and the Km of 61.6 \u03bcM and kcat of 0.299 min\u22121 for the optimized substrate were determined (Table 1). The optimized substrate shows a 1.4-fold higher kcat/Km, as a result of a 3.3-fold higher Km and 4.6-fold higher kcat, compared with the SARS-CoV-derived substrate. The dissimilar kinetic parameters for the two peptidyl substrates suggest that PEDV PL2pro may recognize various P4 residues between beta CoVs (L/F/V/G) and alpha CoVs (K/R/A). By contrast, SARS-CoV PLpro has a hydrophobic S4 subsite, with the result that it cannot cleave the PEDV-optimized substrate and substrates of HCoV-229E and IBV whose P4 residue is also a lysine (Chou et al., 2014; Han et al., 2005; Lei et al., 2018; Wojdyla et al., 2010). Furthermore, in contrast to its considerably greater DUB activity, kcat of PEDV PL2pro for the optimized peptidyl substrate is 22-fold lower than that of SARS-CoV PLpro (Lin et al., 2014). The inconsistent efficacy between DUB and proteolytic activities indicates that PEDV PL2pro is more like a USP enzyme (Avvakumov et al., 2006; Renatus et al., 2006). Previous studies have suggested that PEDV PL2pro, but not PL1pro, is an interferon antagonist via its DUB activity (Xing et al., 2013). In addition, a recent review suggests that PL1pro and PL2pro of alpha CoVs may show different levels of efficiency for cleaving the nsp 1 to 2, 2 to 3 and 3 to 4 sites (Lei et al., 2018).",

Although it is not conserved, mutation of the equivalent residue Leu105 of MERS-CoV PLpro to tryptophan showed a 41-fold increase in kcat (Lin et al., 2014). Again, according to sequence alignment, the equivalent residue of PEDV PL2pro is Thr39 (Fig. S1, purple oval). To verify this, a T39W mutant was produced and its kinetic parameters were characterized by using the two peptidyl substrates (Fig. S5B and Table 1). Interestingly, using the SARS-CoV-derived substrate produced a 9.3-fold increase in activity based on kcat/Km as a result of a 1.7-fold increase in Km and a 16-fold increase in kcat. This result demonstrates that the mutation enhances hydrolysis of the SARS-CoV-derived peptidyl substrate. In contrast, there is no significant difference in hydrolysis of the optimized substrate between wild-type PEDV PL2pro and the T39W mutant (Table 1). This result indicates that the existence of residue Thr39 may be quite enough to support proteolytic ability. Further structural information on PEDV PL2pro in complex with Ub or the optimized peptidyl substrate is required to demonstrate the detailed catalytic mechanism, especially for the formation of the oxyanion hole.",

In the present study, these compounds were screened to determine whether they can inhibit PEDV PL2pro (Table 2\n). Among the compounds, two thiopurine analogs, 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) and 6TG, were found to be able to inhibit the DUB activity of PEDV PL2pro with IC50 of 58.1 and 13.7 \u03bcM, respectively (Fig. 2\nand Table 2). IC50 of 6TG is 4.2-fold lower than that of 6MP, suggesting that the amino group of 6TG may play the role of an active pharmacophore in the inhibition. In addition, two 6MP/6TG analogs, hypoxanthine, and 2-amino-6-methyl-mercaptopurine, were also used for structure-function relationship studies. We found that replacement of the thiocarbonyl group of 6MP/6TG with either a hydroxyl or a methylthio group resulted in compounds devoid of inhibitory activity, suggesting its importance in the inhibition (Table 2).",

Kinetic assays at various concentrations of peptidyl substrates and 6TG were carried out to further investigate the inhibition mechanism (Fig. S6). Interestingly, the observed kinetic parameters showed a decrease in the apparent kcat at increasing 6TG concentrations, whereas the apparent Km was not affected significantly. This is clearly indicative of a noncompetitive pattern of inhibition. Indeed, the data was found to best fit to a noncompetitive inhibition model with the Kis of 21.1 \u03bcM (Fig. 3\nand Table 2). This result suggests that 6TG and the peptidyl substrate may bind to different sites. For comparison, 6TG shows a competitive inhibitory effect against SARS- and MERS-CoV PLpros (Cheng et al., 2015; Chou et al., 2008) but shows a noncompetitive inhibitory effect against human USP2 (Chuang et al., 2018), albeit their Kis are close.

            "text": "As 6TG is a noncompetitive inhibitor of PEDV PL2pro, recognition of the binding site of 6TG will allow us to understand its inhibitory mechanism more clearly. As no detailed structural information was available, we generated a structural model of PEDV PL2pro and tried to discover a putative binding site of 6TG using in silico docking. Interestingly but not surprisingly, we found that the putative binding site of 6TG with the highest affinity score is near the active site and on the left side of the blocking loop (residues 196 to 202), while the ubiquitin C-terminal tail is located on the right side (Fig. 4\nA). In our model, 6TG has polar interactions with residues Asp195, Gly197 (on the blocking loop), Val230 and Thr231 and shows hydrophobic contact with Lys175 and Pro229. Binding of 6TG at this site may render the blocking loop less flexible and therefore disfavor catalysis. A series of noncovalent inhibitors such as compound GRL0617 shows a similar blocking effect, although they are competitive inhibitors and bind to the S3-S4 subsite (Ratia et al., 2008). For comparison, besides residue Val230, the alignment shows no sequence identity for the putative binding residues (Fig. S1, red ovals). Furthermore, the same region is occupied by residue Pro300 of SARS-CoV PLpro and residue Lys306 of MERS-CoV PLpro (Fig. 4B), indicating that this binding site may only exist in PEDV PL2pro. In contrast, previous studies suggested that the binding site of 6TG for SARS- and MERS-CoV PLpros may be near the catalytic triad's cysteine residue due to its competitive pattern of inhibition (Cheng et al., 2015; Chou et al., 2008).",

The broad spectrum inhibitor 6TG was found able to inhibit not only the DUB activity but also the proteolytic activity of PEDV PL2pro. These results shed light on the possibility of inhibition of PEDV infection by small molecules instead of antibodies. Furthermore, based on its noncompetitive inhibitory effect, we proposed an allosteric 6TG binding site which can stabilize the blocking loop near the active site, resulting in inhibition. The present study suggests that 6TG may be suitable as a lead compound for further antiviral drug development.",
