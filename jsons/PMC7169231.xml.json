            "text": "Almost a decade since the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) in 2003, another novel coronavirus has emerged in humans. The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV) was isolated in 2012 from a patient experiencing severe pneumonia in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).1, 2 MERS\u2010CoV has infected more than 1700 humans, with 30% to 40% mortality rate, mainly in countries of the Arabian Peninsula.3 Dromedary camels are strongly believed to be an intermediate host and an important source of infection although the exact transmission mechanism is still unclear.2, 3, 4 Human\u2010to\u2010human transmission has been documented, although this requires a very close and lengthy contact with patients.4 In the most part, cases are mild or asymptomatic, and most fatal cases are the result of comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus type 2, which is again very prevalent in the Arabian Peninsula.4 Asymptomatic cases are estimated to be 2.1 times higher than the reported cases5 and together with mild cases may serve to spread the virus from camels to humans. Primary cases that had no contact with infected patients are more likely to have contacted camels directly or indirectly.6 However, camels are believed to be an intermediate with speculation that bats could be the primary host.4 Dromedary camels were 80% to 90% seropositive, from samples dated back to as early as 1983, in African countries,7 Arabian Peninsula countries,8 and the Spanish Canary Islands,9 but 0% in Australian dromedary camels or Bactrian camels,10, 11 and several groups reported viral shedding from infected camels.12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Nevertheless, despite the impressive and quick elucidation of many issues about MERS\u2010CoV, there are gaps in our understanding of this emerging virus, such as the precise route of transmission of camel\u2010to\u2010human infections, the risk factors for contracting the virus, and the protective level of neutralizing antibodies (nAb). More importantly, to date, there is no specific antiviral or vaccine for treatment or prevention of MERS\u2010CoV infection. This article reviews the ongoing efforts on vaccine development and sheds some light on the challenges that can hinder both the progress and the speed of developing a MERS\u2010CoV vaccine.",

            "text": "MERS\u2010CoV tropism in humans and camels is determined by the binding of its spike glycoprotein to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) on the surface of mammalian cells such as respiratory epithelial cells. However, the virus does not infect most small experimental animals such as mice, ferrets, rats, and hamsters, mainly because of the different DPP4 in these animals therefore posing a challenge for developing a vaccine by delaying scientific investigation on the virus infection, pathogenicity, and transmission. A rabbit model was reported to support MERS\u2010CoV,19 but more small animal models were required to accelerate MERS\u2010CoV research; therefore, susceptible mouse models were developed by different methods. The first model was developed by transducing mice with adenoviral vector encoding human DPP4 (AdV\u2010hDPP4) delivered intranasally to enable mouse cells in the respiratory tract to express hDPP4, allowing viral entry and infection.20 This model is easy to use and can be readily applied to a broad range of mouse strains, especially in laboratories with no transgenic animal facility available. Other models were developed by generating transgenic mice that are either expressing human DPP4 globally20 or replacing murine DPP4 with the human ortholog.21 These developments helped in evaluating vaccines and monoclonal antibody\u2010based therapy in small laboratory animals. Although one of the main clinical manifestations of MERS in human patients is kidney failure, supported by biochemical tests and by the virus tropism in kidney cells, MERS mouse models did not support this and did not show virus or viral RNA isolation from kidney. Large animals such as nonhuman primates (NHPs) supported MERS with common marmosets showing moderate to severe infection as compared with mild infection in rhesus macaques (reviewed by van Doremalen and Munster.22) Dromedary camels are strongly believed to be intermediate hosts and one of the sources of infection, although the mechanism of transmitting the virus to human subjects is yet to be investigated and determined. MERS\u2010CoV replicates in the upper respiratory tract in camels, unlike humans where MERS\u2010CoV infection affects mainly lungs and lower respiratory tract, and results in mild clinical manifestation with rhinorrhea. In experimental camel models, infectious viruses were detected in nasal and oropharyngeal swabs and in tissues up to 5 days postinfection, whereas viral RNA persisted in these samples for over a month.18 All these developments and studies of animal models were conducted in less than 3 years and have accelerated our understanding of and responses to MERS\u2010CoV. Some vaccines have already been tested in mouse, NHP, and camel models, as discussed in this section and in Figure 1 and Table 1, although there seems a long way to go before establishing a robust animal model for assessing immunogenicity and efficacy of MERS\u2010CoV vaccine candidates.",

            "text": "Soon after the identification of MERS\u2010CoV, several groups developed vaccines for preclinical testing. Recombinant receptor\u2010binding domain (rRBD), residues 367 to 606 of MERS\u2010CoV spike (S) protein, has been expressed and tested in mice as a vaccine.23 It induced RBD\u2010specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody when it was tested with various adjuvants such as alum, CpG, P(I:C), or IFA. However, only RBD with alum or with alum and CpG was able to induce nAb.23 This vaccine was then taken further and tested in Rhesus macaques at 2 different dosages, in 3 homologous vaccinations regimen, with 8\u2010 and 17\u2010week intervals. Both doses induced strong RBD\u2010specific antibodies 2 weeks after each vaccination, and similar nAb titers, but significantly higher than mock\u2010vaccinated monkeys. When compared with mock\u2010vaccinated control animals, both doses of vaccines reduced the interstitial infiltration and the gross pathology in lungs, after the animals were challenged with MERS\u2010CoV (Table 1).24 Vaccines reduced the viral RNA load in lung and trachea tissues, and in throat, nasal, and rectal swab samples. However, this reduction in viral load was statistically significant only in throat swabs from high\u2010dose vaccinated animals (summarized in Table 1). Both doses also reduced the infectious virus titers in the lung and trachea by around 2\u2010fold. Moreover, it was speculated that nAb were the underlying mechanism for this partial protection because cellular responses, as tested by IFN\u2010\u03b3 secreting peripheral blood monocytes, were detectable only in animals immunized with the highest dose vaccine.",

In fact, some studies reported that nAb titers were directed against other parts of the S, outside the RBD boundaries.32 A linear synthesized peptide, corresponding to 736 to 761 residues of the S protein (in the S2 subunit away from the RBD), induced nAb titers in mice. These titers were lower than using rRBD but other synthesized peptides based on immunoepitopes from the S1 subunit of the spike protein (S1) and RBD regions induced binding, but not nAb.33 This supports using the full\u2010length S antigen for vaccine development.",

Moreover, there was no difference between high or low doses, in prime boost regimens.34 In a separate study, the S antigen was tested in mice in 3 different forms, the full\u2010length S, the S without its transmembrane domain, or the S1 subunit. All forms were tested in homologous regimens in mice, that is, prime boost regimen of 3 sequential DNA vaccinations (DDD) or prime boost regimen of 2 sequential protein vaccinations (PP), or in a heterologous regimen, that is, prime boost regimen of 2 sequential DNA vaccinations followed by 1 protein vaccination (DDP).32 The study concluded that the full\u2010length S DNA and S1\u2010based protein induced the highest nAb titers in DDP or PP regimens, but it should be noted that there was no full\u2010length S\u2010based protein vaccine in this study.32 The nAb titers cross\u2010protected mice against 8 distinct MERS\u2010CoV isolates; this could be predicted as the RBD sequence is highly conserved between the 8 isolates.",

This resulted in the complete protection of vaccinated mice, immunized in prime boost regimen.48 The same researchers then developed VRP\u2010MERS\u2010N vaccine that is based on the N epitope analogue from MERS\u2010CoV, and similar results were obtained. The depletion of airway CD4+ T cells or inhibition of airway IFN\u2010\u03b3 significantly decreased the protection of VRP\u2010MERS\u2010N.48 This, in addition to the fact that the N epitope is a weak CD8+ T\u2010cell epitope, supports the role and importance of airway CD4+ T cells in controlling MERS\u2010CoV infection as well as in vaccine development. Mice immunized with VRP\u2010MERS\u2010N showed cross\u2010reactivity to several human CoVs (including SARS\u2010CoV, HKU4, and HKU5) with a moderate level of protection upon SARS\u2010CoV challenge. This study clearly supports the cellular immunity role in developing MERS\u2010CoV vaccine and paves the way toward a pan\u2010vaccine as a universal encounter against existing or potentially emerging human CoVs.",

            "text": "Developing a vaccine for human use is a very long process that may take a decade to take a vaccine from bench through clinics to licensure, given that there is a productive and coherent collaboration between clinicians, scientists, regulators, and pharmaceutical industry. Yet one of the big obstacles is that a vaccine should be cost\u2010effective for a company to take it into further development and licensing. In the case of MERS\u2010CoV, although the mortality rate is already high (at least 30%), outbreaks seem sporadic, nosocomial, and zoonotic and may not pose risk as serious as global major infections such as malaria, HIV, TB, or influenza. For example, an influenza outbreak may become a global epidemic in a matter of hours because of the mass air\u2010travel era that we live in. MERS\u2010CoV outbreaks have occurred in the Arabian Peninsula, where it was first isolated, and where there is human contact with a considerable population of dromedary camels, less than the number of camels in eastern Africa. MERS\u2010CoV infections reported outside the Arabian Peninsula in China, Europe, or the United States did not cause any outbreaks, presumably because of stricter infection control measures, but it could be due to less camel contact or the absence of camel population in these countries. So far, the only documented MERS\u2010CoV outbreak outside the primary regions was the Korean outbreak in 2015, started by an index patient travelling back from the Arabian Gulf states. This outbreak had infected 186 people with mortality rate of 19% but was contained in a few months, again likely because of the strict infection control practices.50 Therefore, a pharmaceutical company may be discouraged from developing a vaccine to an infection that (i) seems to be sporadic, nosocomial, or zoonotic with no sustained transmission; (ii) might be easily contained by effective infection control practices; and (iii) might disappear for a long time if strict public health measures were taken, similar to what happened with SARS\u2010CoV. If industrial entities cannot be interested, then the hope is that governments, at least in the endemic areas, could consider funding vaccine development from the basic early studies through clinical trials to approval and marketing. Although the most affected countries are rich, such as KSA, Qatar, and UAE, they might look into quicker measures to contain this virus even if those measures are more expensive than vaccines, which take long and laborious efforts. For example, a tertiary hospital in Riyadh, KSA, one of the biggest in the Middle East with 1200 beds and 250,000 visits to the ER per annum, with some VIP royal clinics, was hit by a MERS\u2010CoV outbreak in August 2015, resulting in 130 cases, with 40% mortality rate.51 The hospital responded by several actions regardless of the cost, among them closing down the hospital for weeks, building a separate ER for flulike symptoms with several negatively pressurized rooms, and constructing a car drive\u2010thru screening checkpoint at the entrance of the medical city to direct flulike patients to the new ER without any contact with them. The hospital was then reopened and had to pay overtime to some staff to catch up with clinic schedules. These responses took only 7 weeks to complete and helped in clearing the MERS\u2010CoV from this large hospital in an astonishingly short time (personal communication with Dr. Bandar Al Knawy, CEO of King Abulaziz Medical City.51) Therefore, such rich governments, under public pressure, might prefer implementing similar actions to all other major hospitals because these are quick and efficient responses and might be favored to funding the lengthy process of vaccine development. Yet the Saudi Ministry of Health has shown interest in vaccines from early stages of development and held a special workshop in Riyadh (November 2015), inviting WHO officials, major funding bodies, and vaccinologists who are interested in MERS\u2010CoV vaccines, aimed at helping and accelerating such process. It discussed the science, the funds, and the plans to set up a blueprint on the subject. There were also explanations of the Saudi FDA regulations on trials, in an attempt to welcome vaccine clinical trials in the KSA.",

            "text": "The question of who to vaccinate is becoming more critical as scientists have conducted vaccine studies in animal models and are now approaching phase I human clinical trials. Two vaccines have begun clinical testing: the DNA\u2010based GLS\u20105300 vaccine that was codeveloped by Inovio Pharmaceuticals and GeneOne Life Science Inc. is now being tested in humans by Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.52 The second vaccine, scheduled for a phase I safety trial, is the MVA\u2010based vaccine that showed promising protection results in dromedary camels.38 Phase I trials focus on the safety of a given vaccine and are tested in healthy volunteers. Therefore, it is anticipated that, because of the safety records of MVA and DNA vaccines, the vaccines could move to phase II immunogenicity and safety trials, in bigger number of subjects by the end of 2017/18 and might also move to endemic areas, provided funding is available. However, the target population to receive the vaccine would be an important question. From the epidemiological studies, the MERS\u2010CoV infects mainly middle\u2010aged male, health care workers, and people with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and heart diseases.4 Therefore, these factors would set the criteria for selecting participants for phase II trials. Following safety trials, efficacy trials could be considered next, where scientists generally use a curable strain of the pathogen to challenge vaccines and assess if the respective vaccine is efficacious; this is being done in malaria vaccine trials (for an example study, see Hodgson et al53). For viral infections such as HIV, scientists need to rely on natural infection as a challenge model. Therefore, for a MERS\u2010CoV vaccine efficacy, vaccinating health care workers, especially those in the ER and waiting for the next outbreak to appear to assess the vaccine efficacy would be 1 way of efficacy trial setting. Alternatively, vaccinating the contacts of infected people during an outbreak would be a way to assess whether these contacts can be protected as compared with unvaccinated contacts of infected people. This approach, called ring vaccination, was used during smallpox eradication campaign by the WHO vaccination program and was recently used for Ebola vaccine in Africa.54 However, this may become difficult for MERS\u2010CoV for 3 reasons. First, it requires a very efficient coordination between scientists, clinicians, and health officials in endemic areas to identify volunteers, to get them to consent to participate, and to vaccinate them within the right time. Second, it requires quick actions, as the peak of the infection may not last for long, 2 weeks after the onset of MERS illness.4 Third, and most importantly, it requires identifying a large number of infected people with a high number of their contacts (n = 200\u20132000) who are willing to participate; however, clustered MERS\u2010CoV outbreaks are usually less than 255 cases,50, 51, 55 making it difficult to conduct a phase III efficacy trial during an outbreak.",

This virus does not seem very polymorphic in the spike protein that is involved in tropism and cell entry and contains neutralizing epitopes. Therefore, vaccines could become available in 5 to 10 years if there is sufficient financial and logistical support. Because there is increasing evidence of camels as a source of infection, using 1\u2010health concept to vaccinate camels might decrease the human cases, especially mild or asymptomatic infection, which may be undetectable but important in circulating the virus (Figure 1). Developing vaccines for animals would require less time, less cost, fewer regulations, and no cGMP manufacturing. If governments in the affected Arabian areas are willing to contain the virus, then a mass camel screening program can identify and vaccinate seronegative camels, which should not be a large number because 80% of camels are already seropositive. Camel vaccination can also focus on immune na\u00efve newborn (or pregnant) camels as well as seronegative imported camels.",

Therefore, the most realistic approach would be to increase the preparedness to respond rapidly to any emerging pathogen, not necessarily coronaviruses. This includes developing technology that can be easily used for any vaccine development. For example, the cGMP manufacturing of MVA viral vector (used for a MERS\u2010CoV vaccine) is based on chicken embryo fibroblast primary cells, which are not ideal for large scale manufacturing. Developing a cheaper and efficient cGMP cell line instead of primary cells would accelerate MVA\u2010based vaccines. Another example would be to develop a technology that excludes the cold\u2010chain transfer of vaccines that would reduce both costs and time to a great extent and make the world more prepared to distribute vaccines against the next emerging pathogen.",
