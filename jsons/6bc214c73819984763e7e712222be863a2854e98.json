Addressing both malaria and COVID-19 requires a disease surveillance-reponse system for febrile cases that includes: (i) early detection, (ii) early reporting, (iii) early diagnostic confirmation, and (iv) early treatment. This system for febrile patients can both support China in its efforts to prevent indigenous malaria transmission and contain COVID-19 infections at the same time.",

Malaria cases from abroad are detected in China on an almost daily basis. Moreover, the malaria vector mosquitos still thrive with the potential to transmit any imported cases that may be missed. This situation is additionally challenged by the complicated ecological settings along the Yunnan border areas, neighboring three malaria endemic countries: Lao People's Democratic Republic, Myanmar, and Vietnam [1] [2] [3] , as well as the importation of cases from Chinese workers returning from outside the region, such as from Africa. Estimates of these imported cases exceed over 2500 per year and have impacted almost all provinces of China over the past decade. China must therefore maintain the continuity of its febrile surveillance-response system, with adequate numbers of professional staff, sustained investments in prevention and treatment, and \u00a9 The Author(s). 2020 Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.

However, after reaching the zero malaria milestone, there is a risk of turning attention away from the necessary actions and investments in surveillance and infection control to prevent onward malaria transmission in China. Strengthening the political commitment and leadership, and sustaining investments in the surveillance response system is therefore critically important. A total of US$ 116 million was spent on malaria control and elimination in Chinese programme on malaria control from 2002 to 2012 with financial resources from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. No longer able to depend on exernal financing for malaria elimination efforts after 2012, because the central government of China have invested an estimated US$10 million each year in the national malaria elimination programme, Chinese funding commitments and the political leadership to realize them are more important than ever.",

First, because the management of imported malaria involves many departments, effective management mechanisms have not been further improved, and as such, various management measures need to be strengthened in implementation of malaria elimination programmes at all levels [4, 5] . Second, the mobile population may lack the awareness, knowledge, and conditions of malaria protection, active consultation and standardized treatment [6] . Without education about the disease, workers risk infection while traveling in highly endemic countries abroad. In addition, the lack of education can act as a barrier for seeking timely treatment with appropriate medicines. Therefore, the proper management of imported malaria cases and population movement is critical to prevent outbreaks and the reintroduction of malaria in the future.",

In some areas, there are no departments specializing in malaria prevention and treatment. Building and sustaining the capacity of the disease control institutions and construction of a talented team remains challenging. The relevant applied research and development of early and sensitive diagnostic tools to discover and dispose of local active outbreaks and respond to unexpected imported malaria cases also urgently improved.

This may very well become not only a milestone in the history of disease prevention for China, but a critical achievement for global malaria eradication. Elimination of malaria in China has been supported by substantial achievements in health and development more broadly, in addition to the malaria-specific investments and interventions. We recognize therefore the importance of considering malaria elimination not only within the broader framework of responding to other epidemics such as COVID-19, but also as part of the Sustainable Development Goals across all sectors as part of a whole-of-government approach. If successful in achieving malaria-free certification by the WHO, China's surveillance-reponse system should continue to focus on people who return from malaria-endemic areas of Africa and Southeast Asia, strengthening the disease surveillance-response systems to prevent the introduction of imported malaria cases or foci, and maintaining malaria surveillance-response capabilities both in the laboratory and epidemiological workforce. Finally, based on China's experiences, we share the following experiences for the global malaria response:",

Collective political will, continued multisectoral investments and a unified and coordinated effort are needed. National level malaria programmes need high-level and broad based support to implement ambitious strategic plans. 2) Scale up of effective prevention, diagnosis, and treatment interventions needs to be augmented by introduction of new and more effective technologies where appropriate, including next generation insecticides in long-lasting insecticidal nets and indoor residual spraying to manage insecticide resistance. In addition, there are valuable opportunities for exploring the application of new tools for surveillance and response, including through remote sensing and artificial intelligence, among others. 3) Strengthening regional and international cooperation is absolutely crucial to regional malaria elimination and global eradication. This will include sharing disease surveillance and response data, sharing experiences among programmes, accelerating the provision of global public goods, and providing sustainable financing to reach the end of malaria.",
