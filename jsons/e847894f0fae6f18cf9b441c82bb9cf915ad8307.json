There is no evidence to suggest that the elderly are prone to infection with SARS; however, there is ample evidence that outcomes are worse. A consistent finding is that exposure to aerosol generating procedures is high risk. For example, a retrospective cohort study in a Toronto hospital revealed that assisting with intubation as well as suctioning prior to intubation was associated with a fourfold risk of acquiring SARS among critical care nurses (7) . Manipulation of an oxygen mask resulted in a ninefold increased risk to nursing staff. Studies to further define risk factors among household contacts and hospitalized patients are ongoing.",

Coronoviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses known to cause illness in both animals and humans. The virus belongs to a new group within the coronavirus family. An important feature of the SARS-CoV is that, unlike other respiratory viruses, the viral load increases until about the tenth day of illness, and then it diminishes (4) . This has implications for infection control precautions and also clinically ones. If a case is put into isolation before the viral load has peaked, then the chance of secondary transmission can be lessened. Clinically, after the first week of illness, one often sees a worsening of symptoms. Molecular epidemiologic studies reveal that the SARS-CoV from outbreaks in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, Toronto, and Taiwan are clonally related whereas those from Guangdong province are more diverse genetically (4) . This may imply that some molecular lineages are more likely to be transmitted than others.",

            "text": "There are a number of factors associated with a poor prognosis in SARS (see Table 1 ). An important factor is older age; studies have shown that older patients are at substantially higher risk of death. In a study from China, the mortality rate among patients aged 50 years and over was 13 times that for patients aged <50 years (10) . In another study, every 10-year increase in age was associated with twofold increase in death (11) . In a study from Hong Kong, multivariate analysis revealed that those who are older than 60 years (relative risk, 5.10; confidence interval (CI), 2.30-11.31]; P < 0.001) and lactate dehydrogenase level greater than 3.8 m kat/L at presentation (relative risk, 2.20 [CI, 1.03-4.71]; P = 0.04) were independent predictors of mortality (12) . Comorbidities, especially diabetes mellitus but heart disease as well, have also been repeatedly demonstrated to be risk factors for adverse outcomes in SARS (4) . The aforementioned risk factors were noted in a Toronto study of 196 patients with SARS (13) . Thirty-eight (19%) SARS patients became critically ill. The interquartile range age of the 38 patients was 57.4 (39.0-69.6) years. The median duration between initial symptoms and admission to the intensive care unit was 8 (5-10) days. Twenty-nine (76%) required mechanical ventilation. At 28 days, mortality was 13 (34%) of 38 patients, and for those requiring mechanical ventilation, mortality was 13 (45%) of 29. At 28 days, six patients (16%) remained mechanically ventilated. By 8 weeks' follow-up, two of these patients had died. Patients who died were more often older, had preexisting diabetes mellitus, and on admission to the hospital were more likely to have bilateral radiographic infiltrates (13) . High viral load at presentation can also be associated with poor outcomes. In a prospective study from Hong Kong, the following factors were independently associated with worse survival: older age (61-80 years) (adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 5.24, 95% CI 2.03-13.53), presence of an active comorbid condition (adjusted HR 3.36, 95% CI 1.44-7.82) and higher initial viral load of SARS coronavirus, according to quantitative PCR of nasopharyngeal specimens (adjusted HR 1.21 per log 10 increase in number of RNA copies per milliliter, 95% CI 1.06-1.39) (14) .",

            "text": "Making the diagnosis has been one the most important challenges of SARS. The lack of an accurate real-time diagnostic test allowed SARS to be spread in hospitals around the world. SARS can be diagnosed very accurately retrospectively using serology. That is, antibodies to the virus will appear in over 95% of infected patients at least 21 days (but preferably 28 days) or longer after onset of symptoms. Although this is of important epidemiologic value, it is not helpful to the front-line clinician who must decide if a patient has SARS. A number of groups are working on developing nucleic acid amplification tests such as reverse transcription-PCR; however, none of these tests has proven to have a sufficiently high positive or negative predictive value to date. For example, in one recent report the highest detection rate was 75% between days 5 and 7 of illness (15) . Although SARS-CoV is readily cultured, the infection control risks to laboratory workers do not make routine culturing of the virus an attractive option. Other types of assays being studied, including immunoblot assays and radioimmunoassays, are still in a development phase. The utility of individual clinical symptoms in diagnosing SARS is limited. However, clinical prediction rules, where constellation of symptoms and signs are used to diagnose, can be of benefit to clinicians in the setting of a SARS outbreak. For example, in a study from Hong Kong, the sensitivity of a clinical prediction rule was 90%; however, specificity was lower at 62% (16) .",

In 1937, the virus, a type of flavivirus, was first isolated from the blood of a febrile patient in northern Uganda. Outbreaks of West Nile fever and meningoencephalitis have since been described in many parts of the world, including Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia (19) . The first North American outbreak was in 1999 in New York City (20) , where 62 cases of WNv meningoencephalitis were reported. In late August 1999, a physician in Queens, New York, recognized an unusual cluster of elderly patients with viral encephalitis. These cases were initially thought to be St. Louis encephalitis; however, follow-up serologic and virologic investigation revealed that the cases were caused by WNv. Subsequent epidemiologic studies, however, suggested widespread transmission in New York City, with thousands of infections in the city. Sequence data from the infecting virus suggested that it was imported from the Middle East. Since then, there have been annual outbreaks of WNv across the United States and Canada.",

The range of clinical manifestations of WNv infection is, however, highly variable (Table 2 ) . Fever, headache, and fatigue are common while skin rash on the trunk, swollen lymph glands, and eye pain occasionally are seen. The incubation period is thought to range from 3 to 14 days. Of infected persons, approximately 20% experienced mild symptoms (\"West Nile Fever\"), and about 1% develop meningitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis (24) . The incidence of such severe neurological syndromes increases with age. Thus, older adults are at increased risk for developing neuroinvasive disease.
