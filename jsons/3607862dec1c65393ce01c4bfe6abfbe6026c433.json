            "text": "flavonoids and benzofurans obtained from Morus genus plants were reported to be PL inhibitors. Jeong et al. reported that the PL-inhibitory activities of both flavonols and flavanones from the leaves of M. alba would be decreased by the substitution of hydroxyl [kaempferol (19) > quercetin (20), 7,2\u2032,4\u2032-trihydroxyflavanone (32) > steppogenin (33)], the activities could also be reduced by glycosylation [quercetin (20) > quercetin-3-O-glucopyranoside (34)] (enzyme: porcine pancreatic lipase; substrate: p-nitrophenylbutyrate) [20]. For 2-arylbenzofurans from the leaves of M. alba, the hydroxylation could enhance the PL-inhibitory activities [2-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-5,6-dihydroxybenzofuran (35) and wittifuran E (36) > moracin M (37)]. Moreover, the prenyl group may also be an active unit in PL inhibition [moracins N (38) and C (39) > 35-37 and albafuran A (40)] [20] (Fig. 3). According to Ha et al. report, compounds isolated from the root bark of M. alba, morusalfurans B (41) and C (42), mulberrofuran D (43), and sanggenofuran A (44) showed inhibitory effect on PL (IC 50 values: 0.4, 0.6, 0.1, and 0.9 \u03bcM, respectively) (enzyme: porcine pancreatic lipase; substrate: p-nitrophenylbutyrate)",
