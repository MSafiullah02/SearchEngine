It is interesting that for a respiratory pathogen, risk of mortality seems to be lower for those with underlying respiratory disease than with pre\u2010existing cardiac pathology. Moreover, the data cited by Dr Stein suggest that pre\u2010existing diabetes is a higher risk for mortality than lung disease, and that pre\u2010existing hypertension confers almost the same risk of death from COVID\u201019 as underlying lung disease. These findings are unexpected, and surely worthy of further exploration.",

In each of these groups of patients, treatment with agents which have an impact on the Renin\u2010Angiotensin System (RAS): ACE inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) is very common. It has been shown that these treatments can up\u2010regulate ACE 2 receptor expression in humans,\n4\n, \n5\n and it is thus theoretically possible that pre\u2010existing use of these drugs might predispose a person to infection with a greater viral load of SARS\u2010Cov\u20102 as a result of greater ACE 2 receptor expression. Equally, it is possible that intervening with an agent which inhibits the ACE receptors may confer therapeutic benefit in those suffering from COVID\u201019.\n5\n However, one cannot help but speculate that the increased and somewhat unexpected mortality risk from COVID\u201019 in those groups where a high prevalence of ACEI and ARB treatment might be expected is somewhat troubling.",

Other authors have speculated that use of ACEI/ARB might actually be a potentially beneficial intervention in those, presumably ACEI/ARB\u2010na\u00efve patients, who develop COVID\u201019.\n7\n, \n8\n\n",
