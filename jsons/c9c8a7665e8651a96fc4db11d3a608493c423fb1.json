We fitted an exponential growth model to the incidence of cases to quantify the effect of changing case definitions on the epidemic curve for laboratory-confirmed cases (appendix p 2). In the model, we assumed that each change in case definition increased the proportion of cases that would be detected among all infections. Also, we assumed the effect of changing case definition was the same for all regions in China. To account for the control measures, such as the lockdown in Wuhan and other cities in China on Jan 23, 2020, and the subsequent days, 7 we allowed the growth rate to change on this date. Because the interventions acted to prevent infections but the epidemic curve was based on date of symptom onset in our analysis, the effect of the interventions would be expected to have a slightly delayed effect on the epidemic curve, which we accounted for by incorporating the incubation period distribution (appendix p 2). The incubation period was assumed to follow a log-normal distribution with a mean of 5\u00b72 days (SD 3\u00b79). 8 When changing the case definition, there could be a backfill of cases that fulfilled the new case definition around the change time. We allowed for backfill up to 10 days before each change in case definition by assuming that a change in case definition could have a partial effect on incidence before the change date t, accounting for the reporting delay, which was estimated from the onset time series and report time series (appendix p 2). We estimated the growth rate as one of the model parameters, and we estimated the doubling time using log(2) divided by the estimated growth rate. We fitted separate models for Wuhan, Hubei province excluding Wuhan, and the rest of mainland China excluding Hubei province, to account for the regional differences in growth rates, epidemic timing, and potential transmissibility. We esti mated the basic reproductive number R 0 , corresponding to the mean number of secondary infections from one case at the start of the outbreak, using the formula: 1 divided by M(-r), 9 where r was the growth rate and M was the moment generating function of the generation time distribution.

The first national guideline for diagnosis and treatment was issued on Jan 15, 2020, and required six specific criteria to be met for a patient to be a confirmed case of COVID-19 (figure 1, appendix p 6). Notably, patients needed to have an epidemiological link to Wuhan or a wet market in Wuhan and had to fulfil four clinical conditions indicative of viral pneumonia to be identified as suspected cases. They then had to have a respiratory specimen tested by full genome sequencing showing a close homology with SARS-CoV-2 for the final confirmation of COVID-19. In the following days and weeks, several revisions were made to the case definitions, allowing gradually greater sensitivity in the criteria required for case confirmation (figure 1). We present the seven versions of cases definitions in the appendix (pp 6-18).",

There was no change in case definitions in the third edition, but classifications of severe and critical cases were modified and clarified. The fourth edition allowed patients to have an epidemiological link to other areas with reported cases, instead of being restricted to Wuhan, and suspected cases required only two, instead of all three, types of clinical manifestations in addition to an epidemiological link. The greatest change was in the fifth edition, which introduced a new category of cases (ie, clinically confirmed cases), specifically for Hubei province, which was the epicentre of the outbreak and had the largest number of cases identified in the country. Here, clinically confirmed cases were patients that met clinical criteria and had radiological evidence of A Epidemic curve of Wuhan pneumonia with or without a certain epidemiological link but did not need to have a virological confirmation of infection. In the sixth edition, this criterion for diagnosis of clinically confirmed cases was removed and no distinction was made between cases inside or outside Hubei province. In the seventh edition, serology was added as an additional option for laboratory confirmation. We modelled the effects of changes in case definition from version 1 to version 2, from version 2 to 4, and from version 4 to 5. We did not explore the effects of changing from version 2 to 3 because version 3 applied the same definitions for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases as version 2 but only included updates to the severity classifications and therefore had no effect on the incidence or the epidemic curve. We were not able to explore the change after version 5 as we only analysed data up to Feb 20, 2020, which included just the first 2 days after the release of version 6. We were not able to find publicly available information on incidence of cases by illness onset date after Feb 20, and had to censor our analysis at that point.",

            "text": "The changes in case definitions had a clear effect on the proportion of infections that were identified and counted as confirmed cases. As of Feb 20, 2020, there were 55 508 confirmed cases in China, among which 27 000 were from Wuhan, 16 000 were from the rest of Hubei province, and 13 000 were from the rest of China. We estimated that the mean onset-to-reporting delay was 8\u00b76 days (95% CrI 7\u00b74-10\u00b71) and the 95th percentile of this distribution was 15\u00b77 days (13\u00b70-20\u00b71). Allowing for a 10 day backfill of cases, we estimated that when the case definitions were changed from version 1 to 2, version 2 to 4, and version 4 to 5, the proportion of infections being identified as COVID-19 cases was increased by 7\u00b71 times (95% CrI 4\u00b78-10\u00b79) from version 1 to 2, 2\u00b78 times (1\u00b79-4\u00b72) from version 2 to 4, and 4\u00b72 times (2\u00b76-7\u00b73) from version 4 to 5 ( figure 2) . Based on the model, we estimated that if the case definitions from version 5 had been applied throughout the outbreak, and there had been sufficient availability of laboratory testing with RT-PCR from the early phase of the epidemic, 232 000 cases (95% CrI 161 000-359 000) 3 ). Among the 127 000 cases that we estimated in Wuhan by Feb 20, we estimated that there could have been approximately 11 000 infections (95% CrI 7000-21 000) that met version 5 of the case definition with illness onset by Jan 1, 2020. In the observed data, there were 114 confirmed COVID-19 cases with illness onset by Jan 1, 2020, corresponding to around 1% of our estimated total. Before Jan 23, we estimated that 92% (95% CrI 88-95) of cases were undetected. We estimated that after implementation of control measures on Jan 23, the growth rate declined substantially to less than 0, from 0\u00b708 to -0\u00b715 in Wuhan, which was a change of -0\u00b723 (95% CrI -0\u00b727 to -0\u00b720). The corresponding changes in growth rate were -0\u00b726 (-0\u00b730 to -0\u00b722) for the rest of Hubei province excluding Wuhan, and -0\u00b728 (-0\u00b732 to -0\u00b725) for the rest of China excluding Hubei. These findings suggested that the control measures were very effective, reducing the effective reproductive number to well less than 1. Specifically, using a mean serial interval of 7\u00b75 days, 8 the effective reproductive numbers were reduced to 0\u00b721-0\u00b728 for the three regions, while the estimates were reduced to 0\u00b736-0\u00b744 with a mean serial interval of 4\u00b77 days. 10 After adjusting for the changes in case definitions, we estimated that the epidemic growth rate before Jan 23, 2020, was around 0\u00b708 to 0\u00b710 and the doubling time was around 7\u00b70 to 8\u00b77 days for these three geographical areas, and the differences among them were not substantial (table). If instead the change in case definitions was unaccounted for, the growth rate would have been substantially overestimated and the doubling time would have been substantially underestimated (table). Using a growth rate of 0\u00b708-0\u00b710 with a mean serial interval of 7\u00b75 days 8 would lead to R 0 estimates in the range of 1\u00b78-2\u00b70. If we instead used the growth rate estimates of 0\u00b715-0\u00b719 (table), we would obtain R 0 estimates in the range of 2\u00b78-3\u00b75. In a sensitivity analysis, using a mean serial interval of 4\u00b77 days, 10 R 0 estimates using a growth rate of 0\u00b708-0\u00b710 were in the range of 1\u00b74-1\u00b75, while using the growth rate estimates of 0\u00b715-0\u00b719 (table) we would obtain R 0 estimates in the range of 1\u00b79-2\u00b72.",

The number of individuals who were infected is likely to be greater than 232 000 because many mild cases were not tested or confirmed, and some infections were asymptomatic. 12 We estimated that many cases were undetected when using an earlier case definition, which is consistent with the study by Li and colleagues, which estimated that around 85% of cases were undetected before Jan 23, when case definition 2 was used. 13 Our results were also consistent with another modelling study indicating clear differences between earlier and later cases identified in Wuhan. 14 The estimated case numbers were considerably higher than the observed case numbers, suggesting a so-called clinical iceberg phenomenon, which is common for a disease that can cause both mild and severe illnesses like COVID-19. 15 As a result, when case definitions were broadened, more mild cases could be detected.",

This method could be combined with testing a portion of the clinically confirmed cases to correct the actual case numbers afterwards. 17 Case definitions are often developed for outbreak investigations in which the objective is to identify the source of infections, 18 while case definitions are used for surveillance only later if an epidemic occurs. In the case of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, the initial case definitions for COVID-19 allowed investigation of potential animal exposures and infections epidemiologically linked with the epicentre, Wuhan, but might not capture cases linked with wider areas potentially affected by Similarly, the earlier case definitions had more specific requirements for clinical manifestations given the limited knowledge of the novel virus, leading to a low sensitivity for case identification including an under-detection of milder infections. 19, 20 As evidence for the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 became available, the case definition was updated to account for this information. Changes in the availability and use of testing can also lead to a similar effect.

Epidemics could appear to be growing faster than they actually are, because of rapid expansions in testing practices. The availability of and resolve for laboratory testing will also be a major factor shaping epidemic curves, 25 which will be important to guide the public health responses. Because of the limited capacity for confirmation tests, Switzerland, for example, might have stopped testing mild cases and restricted tests to those who are more ill, 26 and other countries might need to adopt the same approach as case numbers increase-radiological confirmation could be a potential alternative to track the incidence of hospitalised cases. In addition to accounting for changes in case definitions or testing capacity, analyses of epidemic trajectories should also take into account the implementation of public health measures.",

A first limitation is that we did not formulate an individual-based mechanistic transmission model but used a simple model with exponential growth and then exponential decay (figure 2). Future research could explore more complex dynamic models to account for the other factors that are potentially affecting transmission. One example is to allow for the marginal effects of different types of interventions, such as lockdowns and other distancing interventions that were introduced at different times towards the end of January, 2020, in addition to accounting for the changes in case definitions. As a consequence, analyses of the effects of interventions in China should be evaluated with caution if they do not account for the changes in case definitions. Second, we only explored the effect of changing case definitions on the epidemic curve of all cases because there is no publicly available data for the epidemic curves by severity. There were changes in the classification of severe cases, and future studies are needed to explore their effect on estimates of fatality risk. Third, we were only able to collect data for the epidemic curve up to Feb 20, 2020. Therefore, we cannot evaluate the effect of changes in the case definition from version 5 to 6 and from version 6 to 7, although case numbers have declined substantially since Feb 20, 2020.",

We estimated that there could have been 232 000 cases by Feb 20, 2020, if, hypothetically, version 5 of the case definitions had been used throughout the epidemic. Still, this would be an underestimate of the number of infections up to that point because it would not have captured some mild or asymptomatic cases. Serological studies will be useful to estimate the cumulative incidence of infections.",

Symbols and lines show daily numbers of reported and estimated cases, and colours indicate cases in line with the different versions of COVID-19 case definitions. The coloured shading areas reflect that changing case definitions were adjusted earlier to reflect the assumption that there was a backfill of symptomatic cases who had not yet presented for diagnosis up to 10 days before each change in case definition, and therefore the effect of changing case definition would appear to modify the proportion of infections captured as cases before the actual day of change.
