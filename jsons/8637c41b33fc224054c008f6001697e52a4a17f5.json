With over four million confirmed cases worldwide and more than 280,000 deaths, the COVID-19 pandemic has placed an unfounded burden on the world's healthcare infrastructure and economies [1] . The majority of infections are either asymptomatic or result in mild flu-like disease, with severe cases of viral pneumonia affecting between 1.0% (\u226520 years) and 18.4% (\u226580 years) of diagnosed patients [2] . Its variable infection outcome, mode of transmission and incubation period together have enhanced the ability of the pathogen to spread efficiently worldwide. As a result, there has been an urgent push for the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines to aid control efforts.",

            "text": "Current front-line diagnostic strategies apply a quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) assay on patient nasopharyngeal swabs, using primer/probe sets targeting the nsp10, RdRp, nsp14, envelope and nucleocapsid genes; tests endorsed by a number of agencies and health systems [3] [4] . Patients hospitalised with severe respiratory disease who are RT-qPCR negative may be radiographically diagnosed (chest x-ray or computerised tomography scan), but in resource-poor and high infection rate settings these methods may prove unviable. Considering the inherent limitations in the sample collection process and transient viral load, RNA detection-based diagnostics may vary in their sensitivity. The demand for serological diagnostics is high, particularly because these tests are capable of detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, a biomarker indicative of infection even if the virus is no longer present. This is essential to address crucial questions like how many people have been infected within a population, including those who may have been asymptomatic, and how long immunity can last. 4 Numerous lateral flow rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) tests have been developed, included an approved IgM/IgG RDT which uses the nucleocapsid protein as a target for the detection of seroconverted individuals [5] . Other assays use the spike protein as an antigen, with some using the receptor binding domain (RBD) as a target, a region with a high level of diversity between alphacoronavirus species [6] . Unlike RNA detection methods, these platforms can identify convalescent patients, which is an important functionality to inform outbreak control efforts. Long-term control strategy will involve vaccine roll-out. There are more than 60 vaccines at different phases of development: pre-clinical, clinical evaluation and roll-out [7, 8] . These include vaccines based on a non-replicating adenovirus vector base (Ad5-nCoV), an LNPencapsulated mRNA, a spike DNA plasmid [7, 8] , and those using lentiviral-modified dendriticcell/antigen presenting cells (DC/APC). These latter vaccine platforms utilise in vivo clustered APCs to present antigen to the host adaptive immune system. The Ad5-nCoV vaccine uses an adenovirus vector to deliver recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antigen to vaccinated individuals with a view to elicit a protective humoral immune response.",

The identification of variable or conserved regions in the proteome of SARS-CoV-2 can inform the rational selection of reverse-design targets in both vaccinology and diagnostic fields, as well as indicate immunologically relevant regions of interest for further studies to characterise SARS-CoV-2 immune responses. Whilst there is some limited and narrow biological data for SARS-CoV-2 in the public domain, insights are most likely to come from its integration informatically. Here we present an online integrated immune-analytic resource for the visualisation and extraction of SARS-CoV-2 meta-analysis data within a circular framework [9] . This platform utilises an automated pipeline for the formation of a whole genome sequence variant database for SARS-CoV-2 isolates worldwide (as of May 10, 2020, n=16,087). We have integrated this dataset with 5 a suite of B-cell epitope prediction platform meta analyses, HLA-I and HLA-II peptide prediction, an 'epitope mapping' analysis of available experimental in vitro confirmed epitope data from The Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) and a protein orthologue sequence analysis of six relevant coronavirus species (SARS, MERS, OC43, HKU1, NL63 and 229E); with all data updated and annotated regularly with information from the UniProt database. With this resource users can browse the SARS-CoV-2 proteome annotated with the above analyses and easily extract meta data to inform further experiments. As a demonstration of the tools function, we present an analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, nucleocapsid and orf3a proteins, which are vaccine and serological targets.",

On top of the high level of SARS-CoV sequence homology reported, we have identified multiple clusters in the S2 domain of the spike protein, with homology to MERS, OC43, 229E, HKU1 and NL63 human coronaviruses, which may result in a cross-reactive antibody response in immune sera. Human coronavirus sequence homology is greatly reduced in the S1 domain, with only two small 10-residue pockets of OC43 and HKU1 identity (see Figure 1 ). We observed a 17% increase over the median epitope meta-score in the receptor-binding motif (AA437-508), a region implicated in ACE2 recognition. HLA-II peptide binding prediction yielded a region within the RBD (S316-330) with high HLA-II ligand probability (0.6), as well as strong B-cell epitope prediction scores (28% above the global median).

The average epitope meta-score for these variant sites is 30% above the global median prediction score, with the two aforementioned high frequency mutant residues scoring 35% above the global median epitope predictive score. The sequence homology analysis of the nucleocapsid protein revealed a high level of shared identity between SARS-CoV (90%) and MERS-CoV (45%) on a per-residue basis. The k-mer mapping technique we have employed to identify homologous regions of >10 residues in proteins allows us to identify pockets of identity between orthologs -sufficiently long -to serve as HLA-bound peptides; something that is challenging using only pairwise multiple sequence alignments. Applying this analysis to the nucleocapsid protein reveals two clusters of shared human coronavirus orthologue identity (Figure 1) , with an increased IEDB epitope mapping frequency, high polymorphism frequency and epitope meta-scores (23% above the global median)",

Orf3a has been a target for SARS-CoV vaccinology studies, with reports of it eliciting potentially protective responses in both protein and DNA forms [32] [28] . These immunogenic properties appear conserved in the SARS-CoV-2 orthologue, with consistently strong antibody responses reported in COVID-19 patients [33] . Looking across the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, of the 50 residues with the highest B-cell epitope prediction meta-score, orf3a occupies 16%, despite only constituting 2.5% percent of the total SARS-CoV-2 protein sequence. Moreover, there are numerous high affinity HLA-II epitopes, which may serve to elicit strong antibody responses. Although protein orf3a shares a high level of identity with its SARS-CoV orthologue, we detected no amino acid sequence homology with OC43, NL63, HKU1 and 229E human coronavirus species. Our analysis of the 16,087 SAR-CoV-2 whole genome sequences detected 163 variant sites within orf3a, although only 17 sites have an alternative allele frequency greater than 0.1%, with non-synonymous mutations occurring in 7,042 samples across the dataset; a comparable level of polymorphism relative to the size of the gene compared to the nucleocapsid protein. The variant sites identified in the orf3a gene have a mean epitope predictive meta-score of 2.3, which is equal to the median global, indicating that these sites may not form a part of a B-cell epitope. Comparing the predictive meta-scores of the nucleocapsid protein variant sites, we observed an increase of 26% over the global median, indicating that nucleocapsid protein non-synonymous mutations may impact epitope variability more than those found in orf3a. CD8 + effector responses to protein 3a have been characterised in SARS-CoV patients and appear to play a significant role in immunity [27, 34, 35] . Notably, alongside two within the spike protein, a peptide in orf3a (orf3a36-50) has been found to form a part of the public (conserved) Tcell epitope repertoire across SARS-CoV patients [35] . This region scores highly in the HLA-II predictions with numerous HLA-A and HLA-B high affinity peptides with 19%, 41% and 48% coverage across the HLA-A, B and C database, respectively, and is relatively conserved with few low frequency non-synonymous mutations (mutant allele frequency maximum of 0.0017, N=28).",

There has been a rush to deploy serological RDTs for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibody responses. There are anecdotal accounts that some tests using spike and nucleocapsid antigens have been found to be insufficiently accurate, and have therefore not yet been deployed. Other assays have been based solely on the nucleocapsid protein and our analysis reveal that in its native form this protein may prove a sub-optimal target for use in serological diagnostic platforms [5] . It possesses the greatest number of residues across all SARS-CoV-2 genes with high-frequency non-synonymous mutations, the majority of which have a high predictive epitope and IEDB epitope mapping scores when compared to variant positions of other genes. This implies that there may be an inherent variability in dominant antibody responses to different nucleocapsid protein isoforms, which may work to confound testing. We have located three regions of homology with other highly prevalent human coronavirus species, which could serve as nonspecific SARS-CoV-2 epitopes if used in serological assays. Moreover, we have emphasised the high level of SARS-CoV identity across the SARS-CoV-2 proteome (except in orf8 and orf10), which may have implications for diagnostic deployment in countries that have had outbreaks involving SARS-CoV.",

            "text": "This role is confirmed in our analyses, with several clusters of high epitope meta-scores in functional regions, and IEDB epitope mapping counts. The S1 domain in particular has been the focus of a number of studies looking for specific antigens, not least because of its apparent lack of sequence homology with other human coronavirus species when compared to regions in the S2 domain and its apparent immunogenicity [6, 33, 36, 37] . However, as vaccination programmes begin, most of which will target the spike protein in one way or another, it will become challenging to differentiate vaccination responses from those elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection. There may then be a requirement for alternative viable targets for serological screening. Using the SARS-CoV-2 immuno-analytics platform we were able to identify shortcomings in current targets for diagnostics and suggest orf3a as another target for further study. This protein has proven in vitro immunogenicity in COVID-19 patients, as well as an array of supportive results from analyses performed here. The database underpinning the online tool will be updated regularly with all IEDB epitopes, mutations and functional annotations as they become available. Importantly, this openaccess platform and tool enables the acquisition of all of the aforementioned data associated with the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, assisting further important research on COVID-19 control tools.",

By integrating genomic and proteomic analyses with in-silico epitope predictions, we have highlighted important advantages and shortcomings of two proteins at the foci of COVID-19 research (spike and nucleocapsid), while suggesting another candidate for further study (orf3a). Both spike and nucleocapsid proteins have regions of high identity shared with other endemic H-CoV species. Moreover, several high frequency mutations found in our dataset lie within putative T and B-cell epitopes, something that should be taken into consideration when designing vaccines and diagnostics.",

Previous studies of adaptive cellular effector immune responses to SARS-CoV infection have emphasised the importance of spike peptide presentation in the progression and severity of disease; regions of particular interest include: S436-443, S525-532, S366-374, S978, S1202",

The prediction of HLA-I ligands is relevant not only to the study of functional viral targets, but the full range of potentially immunologically relevant endogenous proteins analysed here that may be presented following intracellular processing, some of which may have less coverage in the literature. Our broad approach to HLA-I ligand prediction ensures that researchers understand the applicability of in-silico informed vaccine targets across different populations, a vital factor in pandemic situations.Ensuring that targets are both specific and devoid of polymorphism is essential to ensuring the longevity of vaccine responses and diagnostic capabilities, the analysis of which is achieved easilywith our tool. The humoral and cellular immune responses, as well as the effects of H-CoV protein homology to SARS-CoV-2 proteins have yet to be fully characterised. With the significant levels of amino-acid sequence identity between SARS-CoV-2 and other H-CoV species detected in our analysis, researchers should be wary of the potentially deleterious effects of both non-specific humoral and cellular responses in enhancing infection, a phenomenon observed in a number of other viral pathology models.",
