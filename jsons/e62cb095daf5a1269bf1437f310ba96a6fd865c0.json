The same goes for neo-adjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy regimens administered with suboptimal timing. It should be emphasized that these scenarios involve patients in whom the disease is potentially curable by appropriately administered cancer treatment. Therefore, a sincere attempt should be made to avoid delays in any of these fundamental procedures. For patients with locally advanced and metastatic disease, treatment delays could be associated with disease progression and reduced overall survival as well as a poorer quality of life. However, this needs to be balanced with increased risk of infections (including SARS-CoV-2) resulting from administration of chemotherapy. Targeted therapies are generally safe while the potential interaction between immunotherapy and COVID-19 remains unknown at present. Therefore, such patients in the absence of any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 should be considered for continuation of planned chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiation. The inability to deliver palliative care to patients unable to move from their homes and the management of treatment side effects are other significant concerns from a forced quarantine.",
