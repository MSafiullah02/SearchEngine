Then it passes through a heat exchanger and finally returns the blood to the patient\u2019s blood flow (Fig. 73.6). This therapy requires anticoagulation of the circuit and the patient through heparin administered to the ECMO circuit so as to avoid the activation of the coagulation cascade in the system. In addition to that, a variety of pressure, flow, bubble, and temperature monitors are used during therapy. It is of vital importance to continually monitor coagulation through the hourly measurement of activated clotting time (ACT) and the measurement of anti-factor Xa, fibrinogen, platelet count, PT, APTT and, in some patients, anti-thrombin III levels, and a thromboelastography.",

VA ECMO provides heart-lung support. It is common to use a transthoracic cannula (right ventricle and aortic cannula) in patients who have endured heart operations.Veno-venous (VV): Blood is drained from the right atrium through the posterior and inferior orifices of a double-lumen cannula inserted into the right jugular vein and returned to the same right ventricle through the anterior orifices of the cannula, which are pointed toward the tricuspid valve. One of the limits of this method lies in the recirculation of already oxygenized blood through the double lumen cannula. This has been corrected with the new design for VV cannulas. VV ECMO may also be performed in older children through the use of two cannulas, draining blood from the jugular vein and returning it through the femoral vein. VV ECMO requires a well-functioning heart. This modality of ECMO prevents cannulation in the carotid or femoral arteries, thus reducing complications arising from cannulation or ligation of these arteries, as well as those arising from air entering the ECMO circuit. This method has seen an increase in usage during recent years, covering 40% and 50% of respiratory cases in newborn and pediatric patients, respectively. Oxygen is delivered during ECMO by the combination of blood oxygenation through the membrane, blood flowing through the extracorporeal circuit, native lung oxygenation, and native heart output. In turn, oxygenation at the ECMO membrane is a function of its geometry, material composition and thickness, blood and FiO2 laminar thickness, time of permanence of red blood cells in the exchange area, hemoglobin concentration, and O2 saturation. On the other hand, CO2 removal during ECMO is a function of the geometry, materials, and surface area of the membrane, blood PCO2 and, to a lesser extent, it depends on blood and gas flows through the membrane.\nIn a VA ECMO, the bypass generates an essentially non-pulsatile blood flow. In this way, as the blood flow to the extracorporeal circuit increases, the pulse wave decreases, completely ceasing when it reaches a 100% bypass, except for occasional waves. However, it is normal for VA ECMO to only involve about an 80% bypass, allowing a blood flow of 20% or more through the left heart and lungs, resulting in a reduced but visible pulse wave. The kidney is without doubt the most affected organ by the absence of pulsatility, producing an antidiuretic effect because of juxtaglomerular stimulation. In addition, non-pulsatile flow has been linked to stimulation of the pressure receptors in the carotid sinus, causing a large release of catecholamines, with damaging effects to microcirculation.\n",

The basic selection criteria for pediatric patients with respiratory failure are similar to those for newborns, with particular emphasis on whether the patient faces a serious pulmonary condition with a high risk of death, or whether it is a process that can be reversed through respiratory, gasometrical, and hemodynamic rest. On the other hand, there are general exclusion criteria (Table 73.3), though none of them are absolute and must be discussed by the ECMO team. In summary, selection criteria have evolved and continue to do so as a result of discussion, debate, experience, and the emergence of new treatments and techniques. Currently, there are no unique or exclusive criteria, and not withstanding general inclusion criteria, the decision to exclude a patient must be discussed by the team, taking into account all possible points of view, without excluding any party from this discussion.",

Work began in 1999 with the formation of a multidisciplinary team (composed of neonatologists, intensive care pediatricians, cardiac and pediatric surgeons, nurses, perfusionists, respiratory therapists, and psychologists) that had undergone training in ECMO centers affiliated with ELSO in the United States. At the same time, ECMO equipment was procured in order to establish the first ECMO units according to ELSO recommendations. The main selection criteria applied were: reversibility of lung or heart condition, failure to respond to maximum conventional treatment, weight 3 of 2 kg, gestational age of 34 weeks, oxygenation index >40, mechanical ventilation <14 days, and absence of severe brain injury or multi-organ failure. This is the first ECMO program in Latin America to join ELSO. From May 2003 to December 2014, the program treated 143 patients for both severe respiratory and cardiac pathologies. Of these patients, 77% survived till hospital discharge and are currently being monitored.

ECMO was initiated for a newborn with acute refractory respiratory failure who did not respond to iNO or HVOF. Data compiled from treatment of 259 newborns were analyzed, resulting in a significant increase in survival rate, from 72% before ECMO to 89% during the ECMO period. During the ECMO period, 98 out of 159 patients with respiratory failure (62%) were rescued using iNO or HFOV, while 61 (38%) did not improve their condition; 52 out of these 61 patients underwent ECMO treatment. The survival rate at discharge after ECMO was 85%. Severity of OI, late arrival to the referral center, presence of a pneumothorax, and a diagnosed CDH were associated with the need for ECMO treatment or death.",

The mission of this new ELSO chapter is to contribute to the dissemination of ECMO therapy according to ELSO standards, practical and theoretical education through courses and workshops, as well as encouraging collaborative work between Latin American centers, of which 15 can be found across five different countries, with close to 200 newborns and 120 children as reported to ELSO by December 2014.",

These will have to be simpler, automatic, and with a lower need for anticoagulants so as to minimize risks and make its extended use possible. In that way newborns and children with severe conditions can be submitted to ECLS while waiting for heart or lung transplant, or as a bridge for ventricular assistance devices. Even premature newborns with severe cardiopulmonary failure can benefit from partial umbilical ECLS in the future. New low-resistance micropore oxygenators will not require the use of a pump, with the umbilical artery and vein used as an arteriovenous shunt. Moreover, newborns with CDH could go through an early ECLS admission in order to minimize lung damage and promote lung growth, using, for instance, growth factors or liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbon associated with ECLS. Some centers, such as Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, have applied ex-utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) to ECMO for patients either with CDH and prenatal markers of poor prognosis, or in order to ensure an effective ventilation of newborns who do not possess a safe airway or for whom it is expected suffer from severe respiratory failure at birth (CDH, cervical teratoma, airway pathologies, large pulmonary masses, bronchial cysts, etcetera).",
