Consequently, CCoV diagnosis requires laboratory confirmation. PCR-based methods have been developed for detecting CCoV RNA in the feces of dogs and they are considered as the gold standard. A conventional RT-PCR test can detect alphacoronaviruses [16], and more specific PCR tests can be employed for further characterization into specific genotypes. It is particularly important since the two CCoV genotypes are commonly detected simultaneously in the same dog [2, 9, 17\u201321].

Long-term storage is not recommended.Negative controls (fecal sample that tested positive for another enteric virus or fecal sample from normal dogs) and positive controls (CCoV-positive fecal sample or CCoV vaccine) should be included at every stage, from RNA extraction to PCR.The advantages of using random hexamers instead of specific primers are as follows: It may give higher cDNA yield. The cDNA can be used in PCR assays specific for different viruses. It is a way of optimize the use of limited quantities of clinical sample.This approach does not distinguish between single or multiple CCoVs in a dog or discriminate between IIa and IIb strains.The conventional RT-PCR has high specificity and sensitivity and is a valuable diagnostic tool for the detection of CCoV in cases of single or multiple infections.It is important to keep in mind the limitations of this methodology: It does not allow quantification of CCoV RNA in fecal samples which may be important in cases of multiple infections; another limitation is the inability to genotype divergent CCoVs that may not be amplified by the PCR primers.Sequence analysis of the amplified fragment allows determining the types of CCoV circulating among dogs presenting mild or severe clinical signs of enteritis.\n",
