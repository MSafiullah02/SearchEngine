Addressing this task is necessary to the automatic recommendation of appropriate articles to readers with different comprehension abilities, and it further benefits education systems, web information systems, and digital libraries. Current methods for assessing readability employ empirical measures or statistical learning techniques that are limited by their ability to characterize complex patterns such as article structures and semantic meanings of sentences. In this paper, we propose a new and comprehensive framework which uses a hierarchical self-attention model to analyze document readability. In this model, measurements of sentence-level difficulty are captured along with the semantic meanings of each sentence. Additionally, the sentence-level features are incorporated to characterize the overall readability of an article with consideration of article structures. We evaluate our proposed approach on three widely-used benchmark datasets against several strong baseline approaches. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on estimating the readability for various web articles and literature.",

As the above example illustrates that, many approaches for automatically judging the difficulty of the articles are rooted in two factors: the difficulty of the words or phrases, and the complexity of syntax [11] . To characterize these factors, existing works [3, 29] mainly rely on some explicit features such as Average Syllables Per Word, Average Words Per Sentence, etc. For example, the Flesch-Kincaid index is a representative empirical measure defined as a linear combination of these factors [4] . Some later approaches mainly focus on proposing new features with the latest CohMetrix 3.0 [36] providing 108 features, and they combine and use the features using either linear functions or statistical models such as Support Vector Machines or multilayer perceptron [12, 40, 41, 43, 51] . While these approaches have shown some merits, they also lead to several drawbacks. Specifically (1) they do not consider sequential and structural information, and (2) they do not capture sentences-level or documentlevel semantics that are latent but essential to the task [11] .",

The selfattention portion of the transformer encoder is better able to model long-range and global dependencies among words. The hierarchical structure can capture how words form sentences, and how sentences form documents, meanwhile reduce the model complexity exponentially. Moreover, explicit features indicating the readability of different granularities of text can be leveraged and aggregated from multiple levels of the model. We compare our proposed model to a number of widely-adopted document encoding techniques, as well as traditional readability analysis approaches based on explicit features. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our work properly identifies the document representation techniques, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance by significantly outperform previous approaches.",

Because those features or formulas generated from a small number of training text specifically selected by domain experts, they are far from generally representing the readability of large collections of corpora. Recent machine learning methods on readability evaluation are generally in the primitive stage. [18] proposes to combine language models and logistic regression. The existing way to integrate features is through a statistical learning method such as SVM [12, 20, 40, 41, 43, 51] . These approaches ignore the sequential or structural information on how sentences construct articles. Efforts have also been made to select optimal features from current hundreds of features [15] . Some computational linguistic methods have been developed to extract higher-level language features. The widelyadopted Coh-Metrix [22, 37] provides multiple features based on cohesion such as referential cohesion and deep cohesion.",

            "text": "Plenty of works have been conducted on utilizing neural models for sentimental or topical document classification or ranking, while few have paid attention to the readability analysis task. The convolutional neural network (CNN) [27] is often adopted in sentence-level classification which leverages local semantic features of sentence composition that are provided by word representation approaches. In another line of approaches, a recursive neural network [46] is adopted, which focuses on modeling the sequence of words or sentences. Hierarchical structures of such encoding techniques are proposed to capture structural information of articles, and have been widely used in tasks of document classification [7, 32, 48] , and sequence generation [30] and sub-article matching [6] . Hierarchical attention network [52] is the current state-of-the-art method for document classification, which employs attention mechanisms on both word and sentence levels to capture the uneven contribution of different words and sentences to the overall meaning of the document. The Transformer model [50] uses multihead self-attention to perform sequence-to-sequence translation. Self-attention is also adopted in text summarization, entailment and representation [31, 38] . Unlike topic and sentiment-related document classification tasks that focus on leveraging portions of lexemes that are significant to the overall meanings and sentiment of the document, readability analysis requires the aggregation of difficulty through all sentence components. Besides, precisely capturing the readability of documents requires the model to incorporate comprehensive readabilityaware features, including difficulty, sequence and structure information, to the corresponding learning framework.",

Since the multi-class logistic regression, SVM and MLP models can combine the features number of words per sentence and number of syllabi per word which are included in Flesch-Kincaid score, they provide the reasonable result. CNN is only slightly better than random guess. We assume that this is because CNN does not capture the sequential and structural information of documents. The HATT approach provides the best among models without explicit features. The reasons root in the structure of the model which is able to capture length and structural information of the article. Since it also adopted a hierarchical structure, the conciseness of each sentence and that of the overall article structure is captured, which appears to be significant to the task. The explicit features further improve the results of HATT as shown by HATT+. Even without explicit features, our proposed approach is better than HATT+. HATT has appeared to be successful at highlighting some lexemes and sentence components that are significant to the overall meanings or sentiment of a document. However, unlike topic and sentiment-related document classification tasks, readability does not rely on several consecutive lexemes, but the aggregation of all sentence components. The path length in the computation graph between arbitrary components dependencies in ReadNet is O(1) instead of O(n) for HATT. Shorter path length in the computation graph makes it easier to learn the interactions between any arbitrary words in sentence level, or sentences in document-level. Compared with traditional approaches, the main advantage of the proposed approach is that it uses the document encoder to learn how words are connected into sentences and how sentences are connected into documents. Baseline approaches only use the averaged explicit features of all the sentences. For these datasets, several extremely difficult and complicated sentences usually determine the readability of a document. This useful information is averaged and weakened by the total number of sentences in baselines.",

Then, we initialize the model for CEE task and load the parameter weights from the saved model except for the transfer layer. Eventually on the target task, the transfer layer is trained while keeping all other layers fixed. As shown in Table 5 , loading a pre-trained model based on Weebit or Wiki can increase the accuracy and decrease standard deviation on the CEE task.
