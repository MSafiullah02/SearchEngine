Although the vast majority of infected patients suffer from a mild form of illness and recover, a portion of patients who fall into the severe case category eventually die of the illness [1, 2] . In a recent study of a cohort of 138 patients from our hospital, the overall mortality was 4.6% [1] . Another study with 402 patients showed higher mortality in males than females and a mortality rate of 19% in patients aged 70 years or older [3] . To date, there have been several studies published about COVID-19 on infection transmission and clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients [1, 2, [4] [5] [6] . However, pathological data are still scarce, and little is known about the pathogenesis and clinical risk factors of COVID-19. The present study was aimed at identifying common clinical and laboratory features from 14 patients who died of COVID in our hospital to gain insight into the underlying pathogenesis.",

A nuclear acid test for SARS-Cov-2 was positive for 10 patients and unavailable for 4 patients. However, the latter 4 met the criteria for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. The patients received routine comprehensive treatments including intravenous antibiotics, assisted oxygenation, specific treatment for the underlying diseases, and supportive treatments. In addition, 11 patients had glucocorticoid therapy during the course of their hospitalization (not known in 3 patients). The major complications leading to patient demise were acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), heart and respiratory failure, septic shock, and multiple organ failures. Case 13 died of gastrointestinal bleeding due to underlying natural killer/T-cell lymphoma.

Compared with the WBC and neutrophil count from the group of patients reported in the Wang et al. study [1] , the present group showed higher counts than the non-intensive care unit (ICU) group and counts similar to those of the ICU group (Table 3) . As for subsets of peripheral lymphocyte, both CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocyte subsets decreased significantly, and the ratio of CD4 + to CD8 + T cells decreased in some patients (data not shown). The eosinophil count of most patients (12/14, 86%) was 0. Although red blood cell counts ranged from normal to a mild decrease, hematocrit decreased obviously. As for biochemical parameters or organ functional parameters, a common finding was elevated LDH in most patients tested (5/6). Eleven (79%) showed elevated AST, 2 (14%) showed elevated ALT, and 5 (36%) showed elevated GGT, which reflects function of biliary epithelial cells.

It is believed that SARS-CoV-2 is less pathogenic than SARS-CoV but stronger in transmission competence [7] . The pathogenic mechanism remains poorly understood. We attempted to gain insight into the pathogenesis through an analysis of available clinical data on fatal cases and literature review, partly relying on the homology of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS. From this cohort of fatal cases, it is evident that male gender and advanced age predominate (12/14, 86%) . This is consistent with previous reports [2] . Most of the patients had underlying diseases before the infection, which likely contribute to risk for death. Radiographically, these patients presented with bilateral pneumonia and severe abnormalities on chest CT images, indicating another hint for a worse prognosis. Of note, some patients showed improvements radiographically during the clinical course, but deteriorated abruptly later on, as in case 1.",

A number of potential mechanisms may have been involved. First, SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect hematopoietic stem/ progenitor cells via CD13 or CD66a directly or through development of auto-antibodies or immune complexes, as seen in SARS [8] . Atrophy of bone marrow hematopoietic tissue has been seen in SARS and COVID-19 [9, 10] . Second, glucocorticoid treatment can induce lymphocytopenia in some patients [8] . Interestingly, case 14 had no fever during her stay in the hospital. The CBC profile from the first day postop showed high WBC counts and lymphocytopenia before the positive CT and nuclear acid test, suggesting that this CBC profile may serve as a good clue for early diagnosis in the future. Third, as seen in another study of ours [11] , superimposed bacterial infection can be seen a portion of patients, which can lead to elevation of WBC.",

            "text": "Homeostasis and a normal immune system are critical in controlling acute viral infection. By dynamically screening 14 cytokines/chemokines in blood, Jiang et al. found that levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 increased in the patients with superinfection, and the mRNAs for these cytokines were also increased in lung tissues [12] . These observations suggest that elevation of these cytokines/chemokines is a sign of superinfection and may be related to a high risk for death [12] . Complement is also a major component of innate immunity. In a mouse model, mice deficient in complement C3 had less weight loss and reduced pathology, improved respiratory function, and lower levels of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in the lung and peripheral blood after SARS-CoV infection, as compared with wild-type mice [13] . Therefore, it is suggested that inhibiting complement signaling may serve as a strategy for immune therapy. Other theories suggest that lack of antiviral cytokine response such as interferon alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-gamma, and interleukin 12p40 may represent a mechanism of immune evasion by SARS-CoV [14] . The elevated IL-6 and a component of complement C1q in our study suggest that innate immunity play an important role in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Dynamic screening of the level of these cytokines and component of the complement system will be helpful for evaluating prognosis and clinical treatment.",

            "text": "Another important player in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2), which has been recognized as the functional receptor for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [5, 7, 15] . ACE2 mRNA and protein are known to be present in virtually all organs (respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain) [15] . The surface expression of ACE2 protein in alveolar epithelial cells and gastrointestinal epithelial cells provides the route of viral entry [16] . These routes are also related to symptoms such as nonproductive cough, dyspnea, and diarrhea. We suspect that there are higher densities of ACE2 in lung alveolar epithelial cells in male patients than in female patients, which may be the underlying reason for higher morbidity in males. In addition, elevated fasting blood glucose, GGT, and LDH can be closely related to impairment of the microenvironment of the infected tissue and the damage to target cells such as beta cells in the islets, biliary epithelial cells in the liver, and myocardium cells in the heart through ACE2 and the subsequent disruption of different feedback loops [17, 18] . The presence of ACE2 in bone morrow tissue can be one of the causes of the hematological changes described above. SARS-CoV-2 may also aggravate the condition of patients with hypertension through the ACE2 in human vascular endothelia and lead to a worse prognosis [16] .",
