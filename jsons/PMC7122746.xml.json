These siRNA intermediates (21\u201323-nt oligos) were found to bind to an RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) and then selectively degrade the complementary single-stranded target RNA in a sequence-specific manner. Not only is siRNA being used to characterize gene function in high throughput screens for potential therapeutic targets, the growing success as a research tool has also stirred up tremendous interest in using siRNA as a therapeutic agent. With many reports on the in vivo application of siRNA inhibitors and the success of several early phase clinical trials, a broad therapeutic application of RNAi therapeutics is coming. One of the major hurdles to realize the RNAi therapeutic potential is to overcome the obstacles to the siRNA delivery locally and systemically to the disease tissues. In this review, we address the challenges and problems for in vivo siRNA delivery for potential therapeutic applications.",

The success of using siRNA to knockdown gene expression in vitro has led to a growing interest in applications of siRNA inhibitors in vivo for evaluation of the therapeutic potentials of the gene targets of interest, potency of siRNA inhibitors, the route of administration, and the unwanted adverse effects. These applications should eventually provide validated targets for conventional therapeutic modalities such as small molecule and monoclonal antibody inhibitors, as well as validation of siRNA drug lead itself (Fig. 3.1) [3].\n",

One study using siRNA-mediated downregulation of these proangiogenesis genes, VEGF and VEGF R2, in clinically relevant xenograft tumor models resulted in a significant antitumor efficacy. Thus, the functions of these two targets were further validated rapidly in a matter of weeks [7]. This example demonstrates the power of in vivo target validation with siRNA inhibitors. In this case, not only the roles of the proangiogenic factors were validated, the siRNA inhibitors themselves were also validated as potential anticancer drugs.",

Since the main goal of in vivo delivery is to have active siRNA oligos in the target cells, the stability of siRNA oligos in both the extracellular and intracellular environment after a systemic administration is the most challenging issue (Fig. 3.2). The first hurdle is the size of the 21\u201323-nt double-stranded siRNA oligos: they are relatively small and thus rapidly excreted through urine when administrated into the blood stream, even if those siRNA molecules remain stable through chemical modifications. Second, the double-stranded siRNA oligos are relatively unstable in the serum environment and are potentially degraded by RNase activity within a short period of time. Third, when siRNA is administered systemically, the nonspecific distribution of the oligos throughout the body will significantly decrease the local concentration at the site of disease. In addition, the siRNA oligos need to overcome the blood vessel endothelial wall and multiple tissue barriers in order to reach the target cells. Finally, when siRNA reaches the target cells, cellular uptake of the oligos and intracellular RNAi activity require efficient endocytosis and intact double-stranded oligos.\n",

The chemically modified siRNA demonstrated a significant serum resistance and higher stability [8], but it did not solve the problems of excretion through urine and targeted delivery. Therefore, a delivery system capable of protecting siRNA oligos from the urinary excretion and RNase degradation, transporting siRNA oligos through the physical barriers to the target tissue, and enhancing cellular uptake of the siRNA, is the key to the success of in vivo siRNA application.",

The routes of in vivo deliveries are commonly categorized as local or systemic. Some of the delivery vehicles and delivery routes are very effective in animals for target validation but may not be useful for delivery of siRNA therapeutics in humans (Fig. 3.3).

The siRNA/carrier complex can be condensed into a tiny nanoparticle of size around 100 nm which allows a very efficient cellular uptake of the siRNA agent through the endocytosis process. In a mouse model, the reporter gene silencing and downregulation of TNF-\u03b1 expression were achieved after intraperitoneal administration of siRNA/lipoplexes [10]. One recent study reported that the use of a cationic derivative of cardiolipin to form lipoplexes with siRNA targeting the c-RAF oncogene led to an inhibition of tumor growth in a sequence-specific manner [11]. In another study, a family of highly branched histidine-lysine (HK) polymer peptides was found to be effective carriers of siRNA [12]. The Raf-1 expression in MDA-MB-435 xenografts was significantly inhibited by intratumoral injection of Raf-1 siRNA complexed with HK polymer (Fig. 3.4) [13]. Another recent study demonstrated a significant inhibition of HER-2 expression and tumor growth through intraperitoneal injection of HER-2 siRNA formulated with polyethylenimine (PEI) [14]. These studies demonstrated that cationic lipids and polymers can enhance siRNA delivery in vivo through systemic routes either intravenously (IV) or intraperitoneally (IP). These carrier-administered siRNA agents were efficiently knocking down the target genes and achieved antitumor efficacies. In contrast, direct intratumoral injection of VEGF siRNA without carrier did not generate any significant antitumor efficacy [15]. In an antiviral study, IV administration of siRNA specific targeting influenza virus RNA genome complexed with PEI was able to inhibit influenza virus production in mice [16].\n",

We demonstrated an efficient delivery of siRNA to local neovasculature in tumor xenograft or viral infected eye through the systemic administration of a ligand-targeted nanoparticle containing siRNA, targeting VEGF R2, an angiogenesis factor overexpressed in endothelium of new blood vessels. The Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-motif peptide ligand is specific to integrin receptor, a marker of the activated endothelial and tumor cells. The ligand-targeted nanoparticle maintains the stability of the siRNA payload, targets to the tumor neovasculature, and enhances the cellular uptake of the siRNA. As a result, VEGF R2 knockdown and antiangiogenesis effects were observed both in xenografts tumor model and in ocular neovascularization disease model [5, 20].

However, majority of these alarming results were found from the in vitro studies and many more studies have shown that siRNA inhibitors are highly specific both in vitro and in vivo [25, 26]. One recent study using systemic delivery of unmodified and unformulated siRNA oligos into mice revealed a lack of interferon response [27]. Two recent reports have revealed that siRNA oligos, containing \u201c5-UGUGU-3\u201d motif, were able to induce a Toll-like receptor-mediated interferon response only when they were delivered in vivo with cationic lipid or polymer carrier, through either intravenous or intraperitoneal administration [28, 29]. In contrast, neither the unformulated siRNA oligos containing 5-UGUGU-3 motif nor siRNA containing no 5-UGUGU-3 motif but with cationic carriers were able to induce the interferon response. For this reason, any 5-UGUGU-3 motif and other potential immunostimulatory motifs should be eliminated from the siRNA oligos if cationic lipid or polymer carriers are going to be used.",

In a recent study, intranasal delivery of GAPDH-specific siRNA mixed with pulmonary surface active material (InfaSurf) and elastase resulted in lowered GAPDH protein levels in lung, heart, and kidney by ~50\u201370% at 1 and 7 days after administration, when compared with scrambled siRNA control [30]. Direct delivery of unformulated siRNA into mouse airway led to knockdown of heme oxygenase-1 expression in the lung [31]. Intranasal administration of cationic liposome formulated siRNA specifically targeting the influenza virus RNA genome into mouse lung infected with the influenza virus resulted in a significantly reduced lung virus titer in infected mice and protected animals from lethal challenge [32]. However, in vivo delivery of siRNA with cationic polymer carrier, such as PEI, is often associated with severe toxicity in the host and may induce nonspecific interferon response through the Toll-like receptor pathway, as discussed earlier. Therefore, pulmonary siRNA delivery may require formulations without cationic carriers. Of late, we have successfully delivered siRNA with D5W (5% d-glucose in water) solution into mouse and monkey lungs, achieving effective knockdown of SARS coronavirus RNA (Fig. 3.5) [33].\n",

Delivery of nonformulated siRNA specific to VEGF to the subretinal space in a mouse model of retinal neovascularization resulted in a significant reduction of angiogenesis in the eye. Importantly, this study indicated that chemical protection of the siRNA was not essential, at least in the intravitreous compartment of the eye, in contrast to antisense oligonucleotides or RNA aptamers, which need protection by chemical modification for applications in eye [34]. Using a murine model of herpetic stromal ketatitis that develops from herpes simplex virus corneal infection, we found that subconjunctival administration of siRNA targeting several genes in the VEGF pathway significantly inhibited the corneal angiogenesis and disease symptoms [5]. Subconjunctival delivery of siRNA specific to TGF-\u03b2 significantly reduced the inflammatory response and matrix deposition in a wound-induced mouse model of ocular inflammation [35]. The evidence also provided clinically viable means for the local delivery of siRNA for gene function validation in various eye disease models. Local delivery of siRNA to the front of the eye subconjunctivally or to the back of the eye intravitreously is highly efficient in silencing target gene expression, and therefore are effective administration routes for target validation for eye disease. However, the frequency and time intervals between repeated deliveries may be the limiting factors of these delivery routes, especially for clinical application of siRNA therapeutics.",

            "text": "The brain tissue is the foundation of the central nervous system (CNS), obviously a very important biological system and one representing considerable interest for both functional genomics research and therapeutic development [36]. A recent study showed that infusion of chemically protected siRNA oligonucleotides in an aqueous solution directly into the brain was able to selectively inhibit gene expression [37]. Treatment of rats with aqueous siRNA against \u03b1(2A)-ARs on days 2\u20134 after birth resulted in an acute decrease in the levels of \u03b1(2A)-AR mRNA in the brainstem into which siRNA was injected [38]. Nonviral infusion of siRNA in brain provided a unique approach to accelerate target validation for neuropsychiatric disorders that involve a complex interplay of gene(s) from various brain regions. For example, infusion of siRNA specific to an endogenous dopamine transporter (DAT) gene in regions (ventral midbrain) far distal to the infusion site resulted in a significant downregulation of DAT mRNA and protein in the brain, and elicited a temporal hyperlocomotor response similar to that obtained upon infusion of GBR-12909, a pharmacologically selective DAT inhibitor [39]. However, the difficulty of performing surgical implantation of an infusion pump delivering high dose of siRNA limits its usefulness as a tool for functional genomics. Another recent study on the use of cationic formulations for siRNA delivery to the brain revealed that delivery was more efficient using a lipid carrier than using a polymer carrier [40]. Electroporation is a physical approach which has been used to introduce DNA into the cells. During the process of electroporation, an electric field pulse induces pores (electropores) in cell membrane that allow DNA molecules to enter the cell. Recently, electroporation procedures have been adopted for local delivery of siRNA. In one study, siRNA introduced into hippocampus region by local electroporation led to a marked reduction in the expression of both the mRNA and protein of the target genes, such as GluR2 and Cox-1, without affecting the expression of other proteins [41].",

We observed inhibition of tumor growth in two human breast cancer xenograft models using intratumoral delivery of VEGF-specific siRNA [45]. It was reported that atelocollagen, a collagen solubilized by protease, can protect siRNA from being digested by RNase when it forms a complex with siRNA. In addition, the siRNA can be slowly released from atelocollagen to efficiently transduce into cells, allowing a long-term target gene silencing [46, 47]. In a mouse xenograft tumor study, after administration of atelocollagen/luc-siRNA complex intratumorally, a reduced luciferase expression was observed. Furthermore, intratumoral injection of atelocollagen/VEGF-siRNA showed an efficient inhibition of tumor growth in an orthotopic xenograft model of a human nonseminomatous germ cell tumor [46]. A similar result was observed in a PC-3 human prostate xenograft tumor model, using the same siRNA delivery approach [47]. Therefore, the atelocollagen-based siRNA delivery method could be a reliable approach to achieve maximal inhibition of gene function in vivo. On the basis of the experience in the successful validation of a group of novel genes for their roles in tumorgenesis using intratumoral delivery of formulated siRNA [2, 4], we believe that intratumoral delivery of siRNA into xenograft tumor models is a very useful platform for in vivo target validation.",

This procedure allows high efficiency of siRNA uptake and potent siRNA activity in hepatocytes, and thus is a useful tool for functional genomic studies in liver. On the other hand, this procedure is not a clinically viable procedure because of potential damage of liver and other organs, and is limited only to research on liver function and metabolism or liver infectious diseases such as hepatitis [53, 54]. Hepatocyte-specific targeting carriers for siRNA delivery into liver are very attractive approaches for development of siRNA therapeutics for hepatic diseases and are currently under investigation. As one step toward the liver targeting delivery, liver delivery of chemically modified oligonucleotide with cholesterol conjugates was tested, as described in recent publications [8, 55]. However, the data suggested that at least three challenges must be addressed: adequate protection of the siRNA oligonucleotide from serum degradation en route to the liver, protection of the siRNA oligonucleotide from rapid glomerulofiltration by the kidney into the urine, and selective uptake by the target hepatocytes. In addition, the high dose used for intravenous cholesterol-conjugated siRNA delivery indicated a widespread distribution rather than targeting the liver.",

The study demonstrated a significant suppression of primary tumor growth by 68%, compared with that by control siRNA, associated with a decreased proliferation index of the tumor cells, impaired angiogenesis, and increased apoptosis. Treatment with CEACAM6-specific siRNA completely inhibited metastasis and significantly improved survival, without apparent toxicity [56]. Recent results revealed the tumor-targeting siRNA delivery using an RGD peptide ligand directed nanoparticle and its application in antiangiogenic treatment for cancer (Fig. 3.6) by systemic siRNA delivery [20, 57], as reviewed elsewhere recently [58].\n",

Therefore, examining the utility of each particular siRNA delivery method in vivo requires confirmation of its robustness during the target validation process with repeated testing in the preclinical models. One significant advantage of siRNA, however, is rapidity with which different siRNA sequences and the matching genes can be studied, which is particularly useful for drug target validation. Moreover, developing and optimizing siRNA delivery in various types of animal disease models will be a challenging but worthy effort to accelerate the novel drug discovery process.
