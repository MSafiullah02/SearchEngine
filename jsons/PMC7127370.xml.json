B. pseudomallei strains were grown at 37 \u00b0C on Luria\u2013Bertani (LB) agar (Lennox, St. Louis, MO) or in LB broth (Lennox), and B. mallei strain was grown at 37 \u00b0C on LB agar or in LB broth containing 4% glycerol. Under these culture conditions, both B. pseudomallei and B. mallei had been shown (Burtnick et al., 2002) to produce capsular polysaccharide and LPS.",

Briefly, to the dry polysaccharides in Reacti-Vials (Pierce, Rockford, IL), 50 \u03bcL of 0.3 mol/L sodium cyanoborohydride in 2 mol/L ammonium acetate, pH 6.0, was added, and capped vials were incubated at 105 \u00b0C for 4 h. Distilled deionized water (100 \u03bcL) and 40 \u03bcL of 6 mol/L formic acid were added, and the contents were dried in the Speed Vac at 45 \u00b0C. Ammonium acetate in the reaction mixture was removed by addition of methanol (0.5 mL) 3 times followed by repeated drying in the Speed Vac at 45 \u00b0C. The glycosylamine derivatives of the polysaccharides were reconstituted in 1.0 mL distilled deionized water. The neutral sugar contents of the polysaccharides were estimated by phenol\u2013sulfuric acid method in microplate format (Masuko et al., 2005) using l-rhamnose as the standard. Glycosylamine polysaccharides were printed on glass slides (Super Epoxy in 16-wells, NUNC, Rochester, NY) using a robotic microarrayer (VIRTEK,Chip Writer Pro, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Custom printing was carried out by Kam Tek, Gaithersburg, MD. The polysaccharides were reconstituted in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (25 mmol/L Tris, 0.15 mol/L NaCl, pH 7.2) and arrayed at 6 different dilutions in triplicates. The original concentrations of polysaccharides from ATCC 23344, SRM117, 1026b, and 576 (micromoles of rhamnose equivalents per milliliter) were 3.6, 16.0, 3.6, and 3.5, respectively. We also used inulin (Sigma) as a negative control (2.8 \u03bcmol glucose equivalents per milliliter). The slides were blocked with 200 \u03bcL of 2% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in TBS for 1 h at room temperature. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, with 100 \u03bcL of a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal serum (specific for B. pseudomallei capsular polysaccharide) in TBS, the slides were washed 3 times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 at 5 min intervals. Serum from a case of human glanders was also used, but at a dilution of 1:5000 in TBS. Cy3- and Cy5-labeled antirabbit IgG (H + L) secondary antibodies were purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ). Antihuman IgG (H + L) (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) secondary antibody was labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 bifunctional NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide) ester dyes using Amersham Biosciences kit. The secondary antibodies were used at a 1:1000 dilution in TBS. After washing, the slides were scanned for fluorescence at 635 nm (Cy3) and at 532 nm (Cy5) with a Gene Pix 4000B Axon Scanner, using the software Gene Pix Pro 5.1.",

            "text": "The general scheme of approach of polysaccharide microarray is outlined in Fig. 1\n. A mixture of capsular polysaccharides and O-antigen saccharides was isolated from different bacterial strains including ATCC 23344, 1026b, and 576. SRM117 is an LPS mutant that produces capsular polysaccharide but not O-antigen saccharides. The presence of capsular polysaccharide in these polysaccharide preparations was confirmed by Western blotting (diagram not shown) using a polyclonal antibody specific for the capsular polysaccharide (Burtnick et al. 2002). The polysaccharides were converted to glycosylamines by reductive amination with sodium cyanoborohydride in the presence of ammonium acetate. To investigate whether immobilized polysaccharide macromolecules preserve their antigenic determinants, we printed polysaccharide (capsular polysaccharide and LPS O-antigens) preparations from different strains of B. mallei and B. pseudomallei on glass slides. The slides were probed with a polyclonal antibody specific to capsular polysaccharide. Both B. mallei and B. pseudomallei are encapsulated with a polysaccharide of the same structure. The capsular polysaccharide is a homopolymer of 1,3-linked 2-O-acetyl-6-deoxy-\u03b2-d\nmanno-heptopyranose-(1 (Perry et al., 1995, Knirel et al., 1992). All the strains used in the study had been shown to contain this capsular polysaccharide (Atkins et al., 2002a, DeShazer et al., 2001, Reckseidler et al., 2001, DeShazer et al., 1998). It is apparent that the immunoreactivity of this polysaccharide is preserved even after surface immobilization, as evidenced by their recognition and reactivity to the antibody specific for the capsular polysaccharide (Fig. 2\n). It is not clear why this antibody gave weaker signal against the polysaccharide derived from 576 as compared with the other strains. As expected, the rabbit antiserum did not react with inulin, the polysaccharide used as a negative control.",

An indirect hemagglutination and a complement fixation (CF) test had been the routine procedure for the serologic diagnosis of human melioidosis caused by B. pseudomallei infection (Alexander et al., 1970, Wuthiekanun et al., 2006). B. mallei infections (glanders) in horses had been serologically diagnosed employing CF test (Marek and Manninger, 1945). Both indirect hemagglutination and CF tests are based on crude whole-cell preparation or extracts of the bacteria, and therefore, the potential for false-positive serodiagnosis cannot be ruled out (Marek and Manninger, 1945, Wernery et al., 2004, Wernery et al., 2005). Neubauer et al. (2005) suggested the importance of serologic tests using well-characterized antigens in the place of crude bacterial preparations to avoid the diagnosis of false positives. In the present study, we used well-characterized antigens (capsular polysaccharide and O-antigen saccharides) in the microarray, and this should circumvent the problems of false positives in future serodiagnosis of B. mallei and B. pseudomallei infections.",
