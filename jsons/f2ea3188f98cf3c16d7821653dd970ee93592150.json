On March 11, 2020 , the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it as a global pandemic, with more than 353,000 cases reported to this date worldwide. Although cases were initially reported to be associated with exposure to the seafood market in Wuhan, China, current epidemiologic data indicate that person to person transmission of COVID-19 is rapidly occurring [1, 2] . Herein, we present a challenging case of COVID-19 that tested positive 48 hours after initial testing due to major backlog on lab testing, and the management options at our hand to prevent the rapid deterioration of this fatal respiratory infection in the meantime.",
