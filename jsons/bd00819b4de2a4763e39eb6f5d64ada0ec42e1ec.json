Infection with hMPV peaks in the late winter and spring in temperate climates (Williams et al. 2004 ; Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda et al. 2006 ) and in the late spring and summer in subtropical regions (Peiris et al. 2003 ) . Infection with hMPV is most common in children younger than 2 years of age, and serological evidence of infection is present in most children by the age of 5. Reinfection in older children and adults typically results in milder disease (van den Hoogen et al. 2001 ; van den Hoogen et al. 2004b ) . By comparison to similar respiratory viruses, transmission is assumed to be through respiratory secretions and fomites (Crowe 2004 ) . The virus has been shown to survive for a prolonged period in nonporous surfaces such as plastic and metal, making such surfaces a potential source for infection (Tollefson et al. 2010 ) . Nosocomial transmission and outbreaks have been reported (Boivin et al. 2007 ; Cheng et al. 2007 ; Degail et al. 2012 ).",

Phylogenetic analyses have shown two hMPV lineages, A and B, and at least four sublineages, A1, A2, B1, and B2 (van den Hoogen et al. 2001 Hoogen et al. , 2002 Boivin et al. 2004 ; Peret et al. 2002 ) . There is confl icting data as to whether the hMPV lineages represent distinct serotypes (van den Hoogen et al. 2004a ; Skiadopoulos et al. 2004 ). Both lineages appear to be globally distributed and circulate randomly during any given season (Boivin et al. 2004 ). hMPV has three surface glycoproteins: the fusion (F) protein, the attachment (G) protein, and small hydrophobic (SH) proteins of unknown function. hMPV infection begins with attachment of the virus to respiratory epithelial cells. Attachment to the host cell appears to be mediated by nonspecifi c binding of the G protein to glycosaminoglycans on the cell surface (Thammawat et al. 2008 ) and by specifi c binding of the F protein to integrin receptors on the host cell (Cseke et al. 2009 ). This role of the F protein in cell attachment appears to be unique to hMPV among the paramyxoviruses. Fusion of the virus to the host cell membrane, mediated by the F protein, results in release of the nucleocapsid into the cell cytoplasm. As with other viruses, transcription of viral proteins and replication ensue, with assembly of virions. Viral surface glycoproteins are incorporated into the host cell membrane and become part of the enveloped virus with the release of viruses from the host cell by budding (Feuillet et al. 2012 ).",

Growth in these cell lines is trypsin dependent. Variable cytopathic effects including rounding of cells and cell destruction with or without the formation of syncytia have been reported (van den Hoogen et al. 2001 ; Peret et al. 2002 ; Boivin et al. 2002 ; Deffrasnes et al. 2005 ; Tollefson et al. 2010 ). HMPV's slow and unreliable growth and nonspecifi c cytopathic effects make routine cultures suboptimal for routine diagnosis of infection. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal aspirates or swabs is the most reliable method to establish the diagnosis of hMPV infection. Up to 2/3 of specimens positive for hMPV by RT-PCR may be negative by culture (Ebihara et al. 2004 ). Multiplex platforms that allow for the simultaneous detection of several respiratory viruses have the advantage of providing specifi c results with a rapid turnaround time and are commercially available (Freymuth et al. 2006 ; Mahony et al. 2007 ). Other methods for diagnosis include enzyme immunoassays (Fuenzalida et al. 2010 ) and direct and indirect immunofl uorescence (Ebihara et al. 2005 ; Vinh et al. 2008 ; Landry et al. 2005 Landry et al. , 2008 Jun et al. 2008 ).",
