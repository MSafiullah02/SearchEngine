However, if the treatment affects filtration or fit, 48 decontamination is achieved but loss of integrity could be catastrophic to the wearer. Our recent 49 JAAD publication discusses research with a repurposed dermatology phototherapy desktop 50 device to administer UVGI for N95 decontamination. 1 This letter highlights critical differences 51 in fit-testing performance collected for different respirator models treated with UVGI 52 administered with this repurposed unit. Using the suggested UVGI dose of 1-2 J/cm 2 , 2 the effects 53 on respirators were variable.",

This may hold true for other respirator treatment methods as well.Our data strongly indicate that to protect the safety of the N95 respirator user, fit-testing after decontamination must be done each time a new model is introduced to a healthcare system. This has significant safety implications as varied decontamination methods are being used by different institutions.5  In addition, N95 respirators should be physically examined before and after decontamination cycles to check for signs of degradation that may have occurred while removing and handling.",
