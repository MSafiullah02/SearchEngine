Until then, all we can do is to make educated recommendations. Those advocated by Dr. Di Lernia and colleagues are logical. Suggestions that biologic therapies may abrogate the severe pneumonitis that kills many are hopeful but as speculative as suggestions made by others that biologics might worsen the course of Covid-19 infection.",

            "text": "As many biologics have long half-lives it is neither practical nor logical to cease these over a few weeks while this pandemic is upon us, as it is likely to last months. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that a significant portion of individuals affected by COVID-19 will be asymptomatic carriers and even those who eventually develop symptoms can transmit the virus to others prior to developing symptoms. (1, 2) In light of this, CDC announced the voluntary wearing of nose and mouth coverings, and we recommend that all patients taking biologics wear such coverings or masks when outside the home and practice social distancing.",
