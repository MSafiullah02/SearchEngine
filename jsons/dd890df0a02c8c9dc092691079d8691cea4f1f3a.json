In this study, we develop the mathematical model to understand the coupling between the spreading dynamics of infectious diseases and the mobility dynamics through urban transportation systems. We first describe the mobility dynamics of the urban population as the process of leaving from home, traveling to and from the activity locations, and engaging in activities. We then embed the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) process over the mobility dynamics and develops the spatial SEIR model with travel contagion (Trans-SEIR), which explicitly accounts for contagions both during travel and during daily activities. We investigate the theoretical properties of the proposed model and show how activity contagion and travel contagion contribute to the average number of secondary infections.",

On the other hand, people are spending more time in the transportation system especially in urban areas. For New York City, the average commuting to work time exceeds 40 minutes for 69% of the city's neighborhoods, and 59% of New York commuters use mass transit as the tool for commuting. To meet the growing mobility needs with limited mobility resources, the mass transit systems are developed to carry as many passengers, leading to enclosed compartments with high population density, close proximity, and long duration. This represents sufficient exposure duration and a close-enough distance that allows for the pathogens to migrate among unprotected daily commuters. A direct consequence is the recent outbreaks of the COVID-19 in major cities worldwide [4] with over 4 million confirmed cases and 270 thousand deaths as of May 2020. Despite the significant risks associated with the urban transportation system and the outrageous consequences caused by numerous infectious diseases, the role played by the urban transportation system during the outbreaks of infectious diseases in urban areas remains largely unexplored. This motivates us to make the initial attempt to model the contagion process during travel and further explore possible mitigation measures that may help to curb the spread of infectious diseases.",

Based on the SIR model, a variety of models have been developed to account for more realistic disease nature, including models which consider the incubation period [6] , the vertical transmission [7] , the age structure [8] , and the vaccine strategy [9, 10] . And extensive efforts were made to understand the property of the model and analyze the local and global stability of the non-linear ODEs, where surveys of related works can be found in [11, 12] . One major criticism for the compartment model is the oversimplified assumptions, where the population in each compartment is assumed to be fully mixed and therefore each individual has the same behavior. Therefore, the model may fail to represent the complex mobility and contact patterns for many real-world diseases. To address this shortcoming, the second approach models the disease propagation at the individual level over large-scale networks, where each individual is represented by a node and their contact structure is captured by the set of edges [13, 14] . The approach was developed based on the method of bond percolation model, and the generation function was used for deriving the important attributes of a certain contact network, including the average degree and excessive degree, which later used to calculate the size of the disease outbreaks. Danon et al. [15] conducted a comprehensive review of the works in this approach. The contact network model helps to capture diverse interactions among individuals with given distribution and contributes to the understanding between disease dynamics and the network topology. However, it is not applicable to understand the spread of infectious disease in densely populated urban areas: it is computationally intractable to construct the individual contact network for all urban populations and it is also impossible to obtain the necessary input for the contact network as evaluating the individual's contact pattern will be very expensive.",

            "text": "In light of the existing efforts and issues, to model the spread of infectious diseases for the urban areas, the compartment model is still the ideal choice due to its well-explored mathematical properties and the scalability when it comes to model the mass urban population. However, the simplistic assumption of homogeneous population mixing needs to be corrected as the population dynamics are highly heterogeneous in large cities. In particular, since human mobility is the driving factor for the spread of infectious diseases, it is necessary for the compartment model to account for the mobility dynamics around the city. And the needs of mobility dynamics assert two additional challenges for developing appropriate compartment models to represent the urban disease dynamics. First, the diverse land use and activity patterns in urban areas suggest the necessity to incorporate the spatial-varying mobility patterns and activity patterns into each of the original disease-related compartments, so that the rate of transmission and the amount of population should be differentiated at individual subareas of a city. On the other hand, while the spatial movements bring people to their activity locations, it also results in massive contact and contagion during travel which is negligible given the existence of urban mass transit systems. This together with the spatial heterogeneity require additional consideration to explicitly capture the contact and the disease transmission during travel as separate compartments. To address these challenges, we propose the spatial SEIR model with travel contagion (Trans-SEIR) to characterize the spread of infectious diseases in urban areas. The proposed model overcomes the first challenge by developing an urban mobility model to represent the mobility dynamics of leaving home, traveling to-and-from activity locations and activity engagements. Then the SEIR process can then be overlaid with the mobility model to reflect the spatial heterogeneity of the disease dynamics. In addition, the Trans-SEIR model considers two types of contagion, namely the activity contagion and travel contagion, to explicitly separate the infections due to urban travel activities and the infections that arise from daily activities such as work and entertainment. Based on the Trans-SEIR model, we further explore the implementation of entrance control in the urban transportation system and develop the optimal resource allocation problem which determined the distribution of limited medical resources and manpower over the travel segments in urban areas to minimize the risk from the infectious diseases. To this end, the proposed Trans-SEIR model represents a realistic modeling framework to understand the complete trajectories of disease outbreaks in urban areas, and serves as the essential modeling components for devising optimal control strategies and policies, which have significant implications to both preventative prevention as well as disease mitigation from the urban transportation system perspective.",

And additional measures such as distributing masks and random inspection by medical workers at the entrance of transportation systems may also be efficient to reduce the risk exposure during travel. While entrance screening can be of great value for the preventative purpose before the actual outbreak or to slow down the invasion of diseases during an outbreak, there is a trade-off among the success rate of screening, the amount of travelers that need to be examined and the incurred externalities such as excessive entry delays and limited manpower and medical resources.

Figure 3a shows the disease of dynamics of two different scenarios in network A, where case 1 serves as the base scenario and case 2 doubles the transmission rates of those in case 1. Both cases have a total population of 10 million and start with an initial infectious population of 1,000 which are uniformly distributed among the residents of all five zones. Since case 1 has the R 0 value of 0.84, we observe that the number of infectious people decays exponentially fast and the system quickly moves towards the DFE state. On the contrary, case 2 has the R 0 value of 1.68 and exponential growth in the number of exposed and infectious populations can be immediately observed. The disease in case 2 eventually invades around 66.7% of the total population before it dies out. While the complete trajectory was not shown here, we report that there is a strictly positive proportion of the population that remains infectious which agrees with the endemic equilibrium with R 0 > 1. For these two cases, we also compare the results with the outcomes when travel contagion is not considered (e.g., \u03b2 T = 0). We can see that the two systems differ significantly and the results suggest that we may underestimate the risks of an urban disease outbreak if travel contagion is ignored, or equivalently we may overestimate the transmissibility of an infectious disease if conventional disease models are fitted to the historical data in urban areas. And the results therefore highlight the importance of considering travel contagion in transit systems for the most accurate understanding of urban disease dynamics and devising proper intervention and control strategies. Moreover, we find that, given the same population distribution and mobility patterns, the network structure of urban transit systems may have great impacts on the disease trajectories as shown in Figure 3b .

On the other hand, network C achieves the maximum transit usage with the minimum number of transit lines, but also leads to the highest number of passengers sharing overlapping trip hence the greatest risk of travel contagion. Based on the results of the toy network, we see that the number of secondary infections in network C may be 7.4% higher than that of network B and 3% higher than that of network A. As all these networks will reach the endemic equilibrium, the excessive contacts during travel in network C may increase the total infected population of network B by over 7.26% and result in the arrival of the peak nearly 30 days earlier. And the early peak is primarily driven by the spatial synchronizations of the disease dynamics which is facilitated by the travel contagion, as shown in Figure 3c . In particular, we measure the rate of synchronization as the standard deviation of the change rates of the total infectious population of each zone. Higher std stands for the larger discrepancy among the zonal change rates and hence the disease dynamics are less synchronized. As the spread of disease usually starts with the first few external visitors in local areas, the rate of spatial synchronization therefore determines the pace and the scale of the citywide outbreak. The results in Figure 3c suggest that the disease dynamics across different zones are synchronized at an exponential rate, and the exponential decay rate for network C is 20% higher than that without travel contagion or 10.2% higher than that for network B, highlighting the catalyst effect of the urban transit system and travel contagion in promoting a faster pace for spatial synchronization. While urban transit systems have long been designed as an affordable mobility solution for the mass population, these results clearly assert an emerging need to rethink the planning and operation of the urban transit systems to balance the goal of efficiency maximization and the risk of infectious disease during extreme pandemics.",

Nevertheless, we further report that direct transmission during travel in the public transit systems may not constitute a major source of infections during an urban disease outbreak. To see this, we summary the cumulative dynamics of the total number of infectious (as the percentage of the total population), direct travel contagion and activity contagion, and the results can be found in Figure 4 . It is observed that, depending on the particular network layout, direct travel contagion may account for a small proportion (10.0% -17.6%) of total infected cases and the majority of the infections arise from non-travel related activity engagement such as work and entertainment. The reason is that the number of travelers in the transit system and the exposure duration are both lower than those during regular activities. While direct travel contagion is the most straightforward measure to quantify the impacts of the urban transportation system, the metric is not comprehensive as it does not capture the secondary cases produced by travel infections. To this end, we introduce the notion of induced travel contagion to measure Figure 5 . We note that the induced travel contagion in these three networks may account for an additional 4.27% to 5.55% of new infections. This implies that travel-related contagion may contribute to 16.9% to 25.6% of the total infections. Moreover, all the results are carried out based on the assumption that the transmission rate in the transit system is half of that at activity locations. We further illustrate how travel-related contagion may change by altering the travel transmission rate, and the results are shown in Figure 6 . Specifically, we vary the travel transmission rate from 50% to 250% of the base travel transmission rate, and we observe that direct travel contagion increases linearly with respect to higher travel transmission rate, while the induced travel rate is found to be a concave function of the travel transmission rate. We further note that the linear relationship is only a local property within the evaluated range of travel transmission rate, which will turn into a concave function as we further increase the transmission rate. And the results suggest that, if we consider that the strengths of travel transmission and activity transmission being the same, the total travelrelated infections may eventually account for over 35% of the total infected cases during an urban disease outbreak.

We report that entrance control for urban transit system can be a highly effective countermeasure against the outbreak of infectious diseases in urban areas, for both preventative and reactive purposes. If limited resources are distributed in an optimal manner, we are able to curb the disease and drive it to the disease-free equilibrium state, and will contribute to a significant reduction in the number of total infections. To validate the proposed solution approach, we compare the effectiveness among optimal control as devised in our study and two other benchmark methods: the uniform control where equal resources are distributed among all travel segments and the high-demand control where travel segments with higher demand are prioritized for resources. The measure of effectiveness is the R 0 value after control as shown in Figure 11 , where the x-axis denotes the number of resources spent (manpower used for screening travelers). We observe that, by only focusing on medium and high capacity modes and if we can distribute the resources optimally, we are able to lower the R 0 to 1.2 by screening approximately 10,000 daily travelers per time step, or less than 4.5% of total daily commuters. While the screening of 10,000 travelers can be expensive in practice and may lead to excessive externalities such as heavy delay, we also find that an exponential rate of reduction in R 0 can be achieved with optimal control strategy for a small number of initial efforts. If we may perform the screening of 2000 travelers with a success rate of 70%, we will be able to lower the R 0 in NYC to 2.32 which represents a 29.6% reduction in the number of secondary infections and implies significant potential saving of lives and medical resources. Note that this level of control effectiveness is achieved through the compartment model and control strategy being implemented at the aggregate level, an encouraging finding is that the outcomes of the optimal control approach are comparable to that of the target control strategy at the individual level with perfect information on the contact network structure and the state of each travelers [24] . Meanwhile, the other two benchmark approaches are found to be barely effective. Despite direct and induced travel contagions, we need to pay attention to the case that infectious people will need to travel using the urban transit system to further spread the disease. If the resources and screening manpower can be optimally allocated, we can effectively identify these infectious travelers, put them into quarantine and stop them from producing new infections. To this end, we also visualize the optimal distribution of resources across the travel segments as shown in Figure 12 . The major findings echo to the general observations in Figure 8 ,",

Moreover, for commuters with east Manhattan as the activity location, the optimal solution suggests targeting those from Staten Island, Queens and the Bronx with top priority. This can help to prevent infectious travelers from resulting in secondary cases within their areas where massive activity contagions are observed. With more resources available, the optimal solution recommends focusing on residents of the above-mentioned areas who have their activity locations in west & and lower Manhattan and part of the Brooklyn area, before placing stricter screening for residents within the Manhattan area due to the relatively low activity contagion rates. In conclusion, the results of the optimal control method suggest a highly promising direction for the control of urban transportation systems in densely populated areas. And the Trans-SEIR model with the travel control approach may have significant implications towards the operation of public transit systems after the reopening of businesses to mitigate further risks of the COVID-19 outbreak.",

The Trans-SEIR model starts with the dynamic system to capture the population movement among different zones and derive the equilibrium flow pattern for the urban areas. Based on the stable commuting pattern, the spread of infectious disease in urban areas is formulated as a spatial SEIR system with travel contagion, and an entrance control framework for urban transportation is further proposed for the optimal allocation of limited resources for reducing the risks from the infectious diseases.",

The numerical experiments in this study consist of two parts. Based on toy networks as shown inFigure 2, the first part is to compare the resulting disease dynamics with and without modeling the urban transportation system, including the differences in disease trajectories, the impact on R 0 values and the city-wide synchronization of the diseases. We also investigate how disease outbreaks may evolve with varying urban structures and transportation systems. The networks have 5 nodes and 25 OD pairs, meaning that each node is accessible from the other. As each OD pair may have four states (S,E,I,R), the ODE system of this test network therefore has 300 state variables and 300 equations. For the second experiment, we focus on validating the effectiveness of the Trans-SEIR model with real-world networks. We choose New York City (NYC) as the study area and verify the model outputs when compared to the reported data during the COVID-established following the Google transit information. The 15 zones lead to a system of 2760 state variables and 2760 equations for the ODE system. Network layouts of three sample networks",

The strong spatial heterogeneity in terms of both activity and travel contagion can be readily observed inFigure 10a, where total contagion during travel may account for 28.8% of the total cases in NYC as of March 26 but the values differ based on the residential locations of the commuters. In particular, Staten Island is the place with the minimum travel contagion as most of the trips are within the same area and travelers are least dependent on public transit. On the contrary, the north Manhattan area has the highest ratio of travel contagion with its heavy usage of buses and metros. For commuters of the same residential location, the split ratios of travel contagion and activity contagion also vary significant based on their activity locations.Figure10b presents the relative proportion of travelers (represented as the thickness of the flow curves) who are residents of zones in the top and get infected in the transit system while traveling to and from the bottom zones. It can be observed that east Manhattan is the activity location that is associated with the highest number of the infected population during travel. Moreover, east Manhattan is also the primary destination that contributes to the highest number of travel contagions for residents of each zone except for Staten Island where most of the commuting trips take place within the same area. The major reasons behind this observation are threefold: east Manhattan is the major trip attractor for other areas in NYC, transit such as bus and metro are the major modes for commuting to the area, and long commuting trips are expected for people living outside the Manhattan area. These lead to both high population density and prolonged contact duration for the transit routes linking to east Manhattan which significantly exacerbates the contagion risk level. Besides, we find that west & lower Manhattan and Ft. Greene/Bay of Brooklyn are the other two major destination locations for infections during travel. The source of travel contagions who arrive at west & lower Manhattan are again the commuters from outside Manhattan. But the corresponding source of travelers who arrive at Ft. Greene/Bay of Brooklyn are primarily the residents within the Brooklyn area, and similar patterns are observed for the other activity locations. The distribution of activity contagion largely resembles that of travel contagion as shown in The major difference is that activity locations are mostly observed within the same location for areas such as Ft.Greene of Brooklyn, northwest Queens and the Bronx. The reason is that majority of the residents in these locations also have activity locations in the same areas, and trips within these areas are mostly made by private vehicles so that travel contagion is not the major threat. Based on these findings, we arrive at a better understanding of the spatial trajectories of the disease dynamics where the east and west & lower Manhattan areas are likely the intermediate stops before the disease reaches every corner of NYC.",

And the parameters are finalized when the model is observed to align with the trend of the reported confirmed cases in general. The outputs from the calibrated model and its comparison with the reported confirmed cases in NYC can be seen inFigures 8 and 9. In general, we find that the Trans-SEIR model may well capture the COVID-19 dynamics based on the calibrated parameters from the NYC census and travel data for daily commuting patterns. We observe that the dynamics of cumulative confirmed cases match well with the period between March 20 to April 5 when a large number of tests were performed so that the reported values were closer to the actual disease dynamics. Moreover, the model results are also consistent with the reported cases in each borough. This suggests the potential of under-reporting or lack of testing in Manhattan. However, there may be other factors such as the differences in income level, level of education, age group, and the adoption of early preventative measures among the boroughs that lead to this high discrepancy. These other factors may worth further investigation.",
