At present, in order to prevent the spread of the epidemic, the Chinese government has implemented strict self- and forced-quarantine measure across the country. This measure may continue for a unpredictable long time. The epidemic brought to people in China and the world not only the risk of death after virus infection, but also unbearable psychological pressure. When facing the extraordinary situation of public health emergency, people are prone to various psychological and mental problems. Quarantine for COVID-19 on the one hand increases the possibility of psychological and mental problems. This is mainly because quarantine gradually distances people from each other. In the absence of interpersonal communication, depression and anxiety are more likely to occur and worsen. On the other hand, quarantine reduces the availability of timely psychological intervention, and routine psychological counseling is also difficult to carry out in current situation. In order to solve some of the psychological and mental problems that quarantine may bring, a new type of psychological and mental problem intervention strategy that is feasible and accessible is urgently needed.",

In addition, special attention should be paid to the patient\u2019s underlying disease, since some of underlying diseases may have a significant impact on final judgment of counselors and psychiatrists. In summary, structured letter therapy has the outstanding advantages of helping psychological consultants and psychiatrists to continue counseling on psychological and mental problems under strict quarantine measures, but it also has many potential disadvantages that need to be further improved.",
