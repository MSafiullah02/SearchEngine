Tests for Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus and coxsackie virus, and influenza A and influenza B viruses were all negative, while quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the patient's sputum tested positive for 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) nucleic acid.",
