Since Louis Pateur who developed a vaccine against rabies in 1885, in general a series of \"specific\" 21 vaccines have been used for treatment of viral infection, mainly because antibiotics in general are ineffective for treat-22 ment of viral infection. However, it takes 12-18 months till the effective vaccine becomes available. Until then venti-23 lator (O 2 supplier) would be the most common tool for saving the life of COVID-19 patients. Thus, as alternative 24 potentially more direct \"broad-spectrum\" COVID-19 therapeutics, several natural and synthetic PAK1-blockers such 25 as propolis, melatonin, ciclesonide, hydroxy chloroquine (HQ), ivermection, and ketorolac, which are readily available 26 in the market, are introduced here. 27 drugs, which target a specific \"host\" enzyme essential for viral infection, 70 but not for normal physiology of hosts, would be desirable for the COVID-71 19 treatment as well. Among such target enzymes is the major \"pathogenic\" 72 kinase PAK1 in hosts that is essential for malaria and viral infection in gen-73 eral [3].",
