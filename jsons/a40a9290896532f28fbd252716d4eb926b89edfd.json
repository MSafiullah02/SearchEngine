As of March 23, 2020, more than 300,000 cases have been reported worldwide [1] . Patients can present with varying degrees of symptoms and according to one report, 86 % of all infections were undocumented prior to January 23, 2020 [2] . Therefore, risk of infection reported in healthcare workers is substantial [3] . In particular, while performing gastrointestinal endoscopy, there is risk of exposure to the endoscopists as well as the endoscopy team, including nurses, endoscopy technicians and anesthesia staff [4] . While upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is an aerosol-generating procedure, there are now data to suggest that the risk may not limited to upper endoscopy alone, as recent reports have detected SARS-CoV in stool samples [5] . This has led to recommendations that all elective and non-urgent endoscopic procedures be cancelled or postponed at this time [4, 6] .",

In some clinical scenarios, the decision to perform or delay a procedure is evident. For example, there is clear consensus that procedures for indications such as suspected variceal bleeding, non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding, acute cholangitis, foreign body removal, and cancer-related care (i. e. tissue acquisition for diagnosis, loco-regional staging, and palliative procedures) are urgent and should continue to be performed [7] [8] [9] . Similarly, endoscopic evaluations of chronic symptoms such as diarrhea and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or screening for colorectal cancer in average-risk individuals, are considered non-urgent and should be deferred. Between these definitions exists a large array of potentially time-sensitive but not technically urgent or emergent endoscopic interventions. These grey areas or \"semi-urgent\" indications pose a clinical dilemma for the gastroenterologist with regard to proceeding with or deferring the procedure during this unprecedented time.",

The goal was to choose common clinical scenarios that do not have clear guidelines regarding the timing or urgency of endoscopic evaluation or treatment during the current COVID-19 pandemic [4, 6] . These questions were posted on Twitter using the \"Twitter poll\" option (by the author MB). This author was chosen given that that he has more than 2,500 followers, with the majority being gastroenterology fellows or gastroenterologists from across the world. The initial tweet described the framework of the survey in the context of the current pandemic. The questions were posted under the comments section of the initial tweet. Numerous gastroenterologists and gastroenterology fellows from across the world with prominent presence on Twitter were tagged to help disseminate the survey.

The actual Twitter analytics report can be accessed at: https://twitter.com/BilalMohammadMD. Scenario 1 focused on patients with positive fecal immunohistochemistry testing (FIT) or fecal FIT-DNA test, and 70 % of respondents suggested that colonoscopy was semi-urgent. Scenario 2 focused involved Barrett's esophagus with dysplasia and/or nodularity needing endoscopic treatment, and 50.4 % of respondents deemed this as semi-urgent. Scenario 3 included patients with a benign ampullary adenoma needing endoscopic resection, and 53.5 % of respondents voted this as semi-urgent in the current setting. Scenario 4 questioned respondents regarding patients with melena, and 44.1 % thought that \"any melena\" needs urgent upper endoscopy, while 53.8 % thought only patients with \"ongoing melena\" or hemodynamic instability\" should undergo endoscopic evaluation. Scenario 5 discussed patients presenting with hematochezia, and the majority (62 %) thought only patients with hemodynamic instability should get inpatient colonoscopy. In patients with cirrhosis who had symptoms of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (scenario 6), 87.6 % thought that they should get urgent upper endoscopy. For patients presenting with dysphagia (scenario 7), 55.8 % of participants suggested performing esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) during this time only if dysphagia was acute in onset. Scenario 8 was regarding patients with a double duct sign on cross-sectional imaging, but without a discrete mass seen, and 53.5 % suggested it was semi-urgent. In patients presenting with isolated, unexplained weight loss (scenario 9), 84.7 % thought this was semi-urgent. 63.5 % thought that all colonic endoscopic mucosal resections (EMRs-scenario 10) could be deferred at this time. In regard to endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for early gastric cancer (scenario 11), 58.5 % of respondents thought this was semi-urgent. For patients with common bile duct (CBD) stones without cholangitis (scenario 12), 35.8 % thought that urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is only needed if patients have symptoms or jaundice, 29 % felt that ERCP was not urgent if no cholangitis, while 25.1 % deemed all CBD stones as urgent. Scenario 13 discussed planned endoscopic removal or exchange of plastic biliary stents previously placed for scenarios currently resolved or for which the patient was currently asymptomatic. 45.6 % thought this was semi-urgent and can be deferred (\u25b6 Fig. 1 ). For patients who had a pancreatic duct (PD) stent placed during a prior ERCP (scenario 14), 66 % re-spondents favored deferring this as semi-urgent. In patients with iron deficiency anemia (scenario 15) without overt gastroinestinal bleeding, 58.3 % thought this was semi-urgent. In a patient with long-standing ulcerative colitis with recent diagnosis of dysplasia (scenario 16), 57 % of respondents voted to defer performing chromoendoscopy at this time.",

These scenarios were deferring colonoscopy for patients who had fecal FIT-DNA or FIT positive testing, performing urgent endoscopy for patients with cirrhosis presenting with melena and hematemesis, and deferring endoscopic evaluation for unexplained isolated weight loss. In regard to other scenarios such as the endoscopic treatment for patients with dysplastic Barrett's esophagus, patients with ampullary adenoma needing resection and patients with double duct sign on imaging (without \u25b6 Gastrointestinal bleeding is routinely considered an indication for urgent endoscopy. However, in our survey regarding patients presenting with hematochezia, the majority of respondents indicated that colonoscopy should only be pursued if a patient has hemodynamic instability. Similarly, in patients with melena, fewer than half (44 %) of respondents thought that every patient with melena warranted endoscopy, while the remainder opted for endoscopy only if ongoing signs of melena or hemodynamic instability were present. These findings are interesting since they might represent a change in typical gastroenterology management pathways necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic.",

One hypothesis for this could be that ESD can be a long procedure and it might concern gastroenterologists that longer procedure times might increase risk of COVID-19 transmission. Secondly, ESD also carries a higher AE event rate than routine endoscopy [10] , so there could be concerns that in case of complications such as perforation, there would be utilization of the operating room services in an already resource-constrained environment. It is interesting to note that the highest degree of variation in responses was for premalignant conditions such as Barrett's esophagus, ampullary adenomas, and ulcerative colitis with dysplasia. This suggests that there is some uncertainty among gastroenterologists regarding deferring treatment of premalignant conditions in the current environment. ",

The respondents are from all over the world and there may be practice variation in different regions of the world. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic is in different phases throughout the world and as the crisis worsens, the definition of semi-urgent endoscopy may narrow. It's plausible that respondents from hard-hit Western European countries such as Spain and Italy have a stricter definition of what warrants endoscopic evaluation during this pandemic. This cross-sectional analysis captures the opinion of the respondents at a specific time in the pandemic, the severity of which varies by locality. As the crisis worsens, a longitudinal study may well show that these opinions on what constitutes \"semi-urgent\" endoscopy narrow over time as disease prevalence increases. The variability of responses could also be driven by the fact that currently there is no defined duration for this pandemic and some gastroenterologists might be concerned about the uncertainty of how long a deferred patient would have to wait until their procedure is finally performed. This becomes especially important in patients with premalignant conditions. The Joint GI Society Message on COVID-19 does state that some non-urgent procedures are higher priority and examples included prosthesis (e. g. stent) removal and evaluation of significant symptoms [11] . However, as the number of COVID-19 cases are exponentially rising in many regions, another major concern for performing any endoscopy is the amount of personal protective equipment (PPE) that is needed to perform a single procedure safely. PPE is an important resource at this time which needs to be judiciously used. Hence, many gastroenterologists are opting to defer many of the procedures above, even though in the \"non-pandemic\" situation these are likely to be performed sooner.",

We did, however, use the engagements and the number of times the details of tweets were expanded on the initial Tweet as the denominator and number of votes as the respondents to estimate the response rate. Our estimated response rate is low, however, previously reported response rates are applicable to traditional methods like email and regular mail, and may not apply to social media platforms like Twitter. This highlights the need to develop new standards of data acquisition/surveys as social media platforms are going to be increasingly and effectively used for this purpose in the future. Also, we cannot tell how many of the people who cast votes were from which countries and what level in their career (gastroenterologists, gastroenterology fellows, internal medicine physicians). Expanding on this, there were poll questions regarding procedures such as ERCP and ESD, which a minority of the respondents actually perform in clinical practice. It is unclear whether answers would vary if only physicians credentialed in these techniques were al-lowed to respond. As previously mentioned, this crisis is in different phases throughout the world. At the time of this manuscript, Spain and Italy continue to have dire situations regarding PPE availability, and inpatient volume has exceeded the critical care threshold capacity in many of these centers. We were not able to stratify responses by geographical region to assess for variability, which would have certainly provided important information. In addition, releasing a poll on Twitter will only capture physicians who are currently engaged in using this particular social media platform, and the popularity of Twitter use varies among different countries. However, we did find significant engagement from across the world (North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia), and participation from gastroenterologists from both the academic and community setting.",
