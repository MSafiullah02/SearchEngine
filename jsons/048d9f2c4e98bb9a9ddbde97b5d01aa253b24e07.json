One of the most important applications of immunoinformatics is the prediction of a variety of specific epitopes for B cell recognition and T cell through MHC class I and II molecules. This method reduces costs and time compared to laboratory tests. In this state-of-the-art review, we review about 50 papers to find the latest and most used immunoinformatic tools as well as their applications for predicting the viral, bacterial and tumoral structural and linear epitopes of B and T cells. In the clinic, the main application of prediction of epitopes is for designing peptide-based vaccines. Peptide-based vaccines are a considerably potential alternative to low-cost vaccines that may reduce the risks related to the production of common vaccines.",

In order to the T cells identify the antigens, antigenic peptides should be attached to clefts of MHC (major histocompatibility complex) molecules, also known as HLA (human leukocyte 1 3 antigen) in humans. MHC molecules expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs) represent epitope peptides to T cells. These peptide epitopes should be linear that can attach to the cleft of MHCs. T cells are phenotypically classified into CD8+ and CD4+ lymphocytes. (Martin et al. 2006 ) Activated CD8 + cells are called cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) bound to peptides presented by class I MHC molecules on APCs and are specific to intracellular antigens. Activated CD4+ cells are called T helper (TH) cells bound to peptides presented by class II MHC molecules and are specific to extracellular antigens Moise and De Groot 2006) . HLA system coded with 21 genes on chromosome 6 is highly polymorphic. HLA Class I has three HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C loci, which detect peptide sequences of 8-12 amino acids long. HLA Class II contains HLA-DR, HLA-DP and HLA-DQ, and is bound to larger sequences of 15-24 amino acids. Identifying different alleles of HLAs is very important for predicting T cell epitopes (Sette et al. 1990) .",

In linear epitopes, the amino acid sequence of the protein is used as an epitope and there are various criteria to choose an optimal epitope. The three-dimensional antigen structure plays an important role, and for predicting these epitopes, their three-dimensional structure should be used. Therefore, the peptide sequences of these epitopes can be adjacent to each other in the threedimensional structure, but in the linear sequence, they are distant from each other (Sharon et al. 2014) . Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray crystallographic methods are two methods for determining the number of epitopes for B cells that are very costly and time-consuming. Today, with the advancement of immunoinformatics tools, it is possible to predict B cell epitopes more accurately. The most antigenic epitopes are not linear sequences of amino acids; they are structures composed of different protein sections in the form of three-dimensional structure. Therefore, their bioinformatics modelling is required for the proper development of antigenic regions in predicting the epitopes of B cells (Potocnakova et al. 2016) .",

These peptides are a good candidate for vaccine production, because they are easily produced, not mutated, are chemically stable and potentially do not cause infection. These sequences can be also manipulated. In this case, their chemical stability can be increased, and unwanted side effects seen in normal sequences can be minimized through these manipulations. The identification of peptide epitopes can be useful in the production of vaccines against microorganisms that have very little growth in the medium, as well as microorganisms whose antigenic regions are not detected during the normal infection of the immune system. These methods are used in the production of the vaccine against anti-cancer antigens (Mohsenzadegan et al. 2015; Perrie et al. 2007; Petrovsky and Aguilar 2004; Thompson and Staats 2011; Li et al. 2014) .",
