Gloves and gowns were not swabbed because these are disposed after each use. Data on HCW category and details of activity in the room were recorded. Patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR assays within the prior 48 hours were selected, and clinical data (ie, day of illness, presence of symptoms, and cycle threshold [Ct] value of clinical PCR) were obtained from the medical record. Environmental samples were tested using specific real-time RT-PCR methods targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and E genes.4\n",

One limitation of our study was the use of surface swabs for sampling the surface of N95 masks rather than processing masks in extraction buffers with detergents, which is a method that has been used for isolation of influenza from N95 respirators.5 Surface swabbing may be insufficient for the detection of entrapped viral particles. Second, all patients were in airborne infection isolation rooms with 12 air exchanges per hour, and these results may not be generalizable to other room configurations. Third, we did not assess the concomitant level of viral contamination of the environment in this study to correlate with the level of PPE contamination.",
