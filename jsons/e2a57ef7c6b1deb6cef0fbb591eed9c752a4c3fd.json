The vast majority of pulmonary malignancies are in fact metastases, characteristically located in peripheral lower lung segments as well-circumscribed nodules and most commonly associated with Wilm's tumour and osteosarcoma [4] [5] [6] . While parenchymal lesions exhibit a more insidious and non-specific presentation, endotracheal and endobronchial lesions often present with unilateral wheeze due to obstruction and can be easily misdiagnosed as asthma [7] . Despite the rarity and non-specific clinical presentation of most lung tumours, malignant disease should be considered in children with constitutional symptoms and persistent wheeze, haemoptysis, atelectasis or pneumonia who fail to respond to therapy [5] .",

Excess leukaemic aggregates can lead to pulmonary leukostasis, a life-threatening complication where cellular occlusion of the pulmonary vasculature leads to hypoxia and acute respiratory distress [9, 10] . While this condition only occurs in up to 6% of children with acute hyperleukocytic leukaemias, associated respiratory failure is one of the most common causes of early mortality in this setting [11, 12] .",

Aggregates of rigid blasts cause plugging of the microvasculature and associated oxygen defects, potentiating pulmonary endothelial injury, haemorrhage and tissue hypoxia [8, 13, 14] . As such, the risk of respiratory complications increases with the degree of leukocytosis [15] . However, not all children with high leukocyte counts, such as those with chronic leukaemias, develop this complication due to the morphology and maturity of the leukocytes. Children with AML are at greatest risk of pulmonary leukostasis and tend to develop respiratory distress at lower leukocyte counts than those with ALL [9, 12] . This is because myeloblasts are larger and release pro-inflammatory cytokines with specific adhesion molecules that facilitate aggressive invasion of pulmonary endothelium [12, 16] .",

Chest radiography can also be normal, with studies suggesting it is only useful for evaluating a symptomatic child or monitoring treatment response [43, 45] . While bronchoalveolar lavage is a valuable diagnostic tool, it may be of less value if patients have already commenced empirical broad-spectrum antimicrobials [46] . CT-guided fineneedle biopsy can also play a role; however, the gold standard remains thoracoscopic or open lung biopsy [47] . This is usually reserved for diagnostically challenging cases that are non-responsive to therapy.

In the absence of its detoxifying enzyme, bleomycin hydrolase [72, 73] , bleomycin can accumulate in the lungs to cause proteolysis of lung parenchyma and direct endothelial injury. Subsequent vascular permeability results in interstitial oedema and the formation of hyaline membranes as plasma proteins and fluid enters alveoli [2] . Cytokines (primarily TNF-\u03b1, IL-1B and TGF-B) further potentiate endothelial damage and type 1 pneumocyte apoptosis [61, 74, 75] . Finally, inflammatory cell influx and immune processes lead to fibrosis of the lung parenchyma and bronchi [2] . Tissue pathology has revealed type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, haemorrhage and oedema consistent with diffuse alveolar damage [55] .",

CT radiography can be a useful adjunct for monitoring disease progression and typically demonstrates fine nodular infiltrates with a bibasilar reticular pattern [55] . While bleomycin injury is generally associated with restrictive defects and impaired diffusion, a recent study in children treated with contemporary, lowerdose bleomycin regimens found hyperinflation and obstructive lung disease to be most common up to 12 years post-diagnosis [2, 65, 66] .

Abnormal growth of musculoskeletal structures can also decrease chest wall compliance and further restrict pulmonary function [58] . Other respiratory morbidities can be associated with cardiopulmonary compromise, limited exercise tolerance and infections due to delayed immune reconstitution. Notably, studies have found the cumulative incidence of pulmonary morbidities increases with time since diagnosis [59] .

Though opportunistic infections rarely occur late post-BMT, cases are reported which suggests that transplantation itself (in the absence of GVHD or immunosuppression) can cause long-term immune dysfunction [115] . One of the factors influencing this is that for restoration of humoral immune function, post-BMT rebuilding of stores of na\u00efve B cells and memory B cells is necessary. Hence all BMT patients are at risk of opportunistic infections from encapsulated bacteria and viruses for up to 1 year post-BMT [115] .",

Historically the lungs were not believed to be a typical target for acute GVHD; however, data now reveals that this is the case for a subgroup of patients [122] . Recent National Institute of Health (NIH) working groups have sought to better define lung chronic GVHD [123, 124] . Previously, the only diagnostic pulmonary manifestation of cGVHD was biopsy-proven constric-tive bronchiolitis obliterans (CBO); however, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), a clinical entity, is now included in the NIH diagnostic criteria for lung cGVHD [123] .",

While the clinical BOS classification includes CBO, BOS also encompasses other pathological entities such as lymphocytic bronchiolitis (LB) [124, 128] . In LB, lymphocytic inflammation occurs around and infiltrates the peripheral airways; however, there is no sub-epithelial fibrosis. It has been proposed that LB may be an earlier stage in the development of CBO from several differing underlying disorders including infection [129] . CBO and LB patients present with similar clinical symptoms and have similar pulmonary function; however, those with LB respond better to treatment [128] .

The risk of PTLD in BMT is lower than that in solid organ transplant, and the incidence is reported to be 0.5-1% [122, 130] . It is most commonly reported in allogeneic transplant recipients, and risk factors are HLA mismatch, T-cell-depleted grafts and EBV-seronegative recipients matched with EBV-seropositive donors [131] . Conditioning protocols that result in T-cell depletion and in turn cause uninhibited EBV-driven B-cell production are implicated in PTLD. PTLD can be classified into four pathogenic categories:",

PVOD symptoms typically occur weeks to months post-BMT with progressive dyspnoea being a common early symptom. Symptoms of right heart failure develop as pulmonary hypertension worsens.
