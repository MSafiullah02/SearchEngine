            "text": "As an alternative to the currently limited COVID-19 diagnostic approaches, point-of-care (POC) devices employing lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) technology have been developed to detect COVID-19 in human serum [2]. IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in human blood after COVID-19 infection. An examination of the levels of these antibodies can provide information on the progress and stages of viral infection. As the number of confirmed worldwide cases rises, several POC LFIA devices with the capacity to simultaneously detect IgG and IgM levels have been developed and now serve as screening tools for COVID-19; these tools are being used to fill the urgent need for additional and rapid diagnostic tools. Examples of LFIA devices for COVID-19 diagnosis were mainly based on the detection of IgG/IgM antibodies. The CE certified coronavirus (COVID-19) rapid test developed by Sure Biotech, USA can test the IgG/IgM antibodies with either whole blood or serum within 20 minutes [3]. Other promising LFIA diagnostics for either whole blood or serum tests are the GenBody COVID-19 IgM/IgG device conducted by GenBody, Korea; the COVID-19 IgM/IgG rapid test launched by BioMedomics, USA; and the Coronavirus COVID-19 Test\u2014Home Self Test Kit produced by The Hive Pharmacy, UK. While tests for examining COVID-19-associated antibodies in blood are already in use, additional approaches have been developed. Tan et al., have found higher positive test results using specimens such as nucleocapsid (N) or spike (S) proteins collected via nasal or pharyngeal swabs (potentially used at home) [4]. As of March 28, 2020, several possible POC diagnostic tools working with samples collected from swabs have received emergency use authorization from the FDA, extending the possible options of sampling tools.",

The demand for necessary medical supplies and equipment has been high and is likely to outpace the capacity for rapid, but vitally necessary replenishment. Citizens and potential patients must leave their homes to seek medical help, which pokes a hole in isolation and quarantine efforts that threatens disease control. Additionally, the shortage of isolation wards and proper medical devices has prompted the medical community to encourage those with mild or suspected symptoms to remain at home. Clearly an alternative, home-based diagnostic test would offer an invaluable solution to fill this urgent and unmet need.",

Applied to the current crisis, it could be used to create a medical platform to help patients receive proper healthcare at home and establish a comprehensive disease management database for government and healthcare organizations, as shown in Figure 1. People with mild symptoms could obtain diagnostic and healthcare equipment (protective masks, thermometers, medications, POC COVID-19 kits for diagnosing and monitoring infection). Patients could upload their health status regularly to the IoMT platform (clinical cloud storage) via the internet, and their information could be transferred to nearby hospitals, the Center for Disease Control (CDC), and state and local health bureaus. Hospitals could subsequently offer online health consultations based on each patient\u2019s health condition, and the government (the CDC, and local and state health bureaus) could allocate equipment and designate quarantine stations (hotels or centralized quarantine facilities) if necessary. Using the IoMT platform, people could dynamically monitor their disease status and receive proper medical needs without spreading the virus to others. This would reduce national health costs, mitigate the stresses of medical device shortage, and provide a systemic database that would allow the government to adequately monitor disease spread, appropriately distribute supplies, and implement emergency strategies.",
