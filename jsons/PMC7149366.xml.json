The ocular adnexae \u2013 periorbita, eyelids and lashes, lacrimal and meibomian glands \u2013 produce, spread and drain the preocular tear film, physically protect the sensitive ocular mucosa, and cushion the globe. The redundant conjunctiva with its low-viscosity tear film allows rapid multidirectional eye movements. Lymphoid tissues within the conjunctiva and lacrimal glands furnish acquired immune defense. The cornea and its tear film fashion the major refractive surface of the eye. The sclera forms the wall of the globe and scaffolds the intraocular tissues. The eye's lens provides additional refractive power and filters ultraviolet light. The iris diaphragm dynamically regulates the amount of light incident on the retina, and together with the choroid and optic nerve head provides immune effector cells to the interior of the eye. The retina transduces light energy into neural signals; retinal function is requisite for vision. The vascular choroid nourishes the outer layers of the retina. The anterior (aqueous) and posterior (vitreous) humors provide internal pressure sufficient for maintenance of normal anatomic relationships, nourish the interior ocular tissues, provide immunosuppressive factors necessary to the maintenance of immune deviation, and during infection act as conduits for the distribution of inflammatory cells derived from the iris, ciliary body and optic nerve head.",

Infection of the eyelid skin induces the formation of vesicles and ulcers.\nViral infection of the conjunctiva results in vasodilatation, serous discharge, hyperplasia of conjunctival lymphoid follicles, and enlargement of the corresponding draining lymph nodes. Severe conjunctival infection can cause permanent scarring of the globe to the eyelids and turning in of the eyelashes against the eye.\nViral infection of the corneal epithelium induces punctate epithelial cytopathic effect evident biomicroscopically as isolated swollen epithelial cells (punctate epithelial keratitis) and loss of individual epithelial cells (punctate epithelial erosions). When extensive, the punctate erosions may coalesce to form confluent epithelial ulcers with dendritic, dendritiform or geographic morphology. With herpetic infection, corneal anesthesia can ensue, and in the absence of epitheliotropic neural growth factors, corneal epithelial integrity is impaired. Reduced corneal clarity and progressive sterile ulceration may result. Corneal stromal infection induces white blood cell recruitment; subsequent corneal scarring, vascularization and lipid deposition may permanently reduce vision. Intraocular infection manifests in inflammatory cell deposits on the posterior surface of the cornea and on the vitreous scaffold, and in free-floating leucocytes and biomicroscopically visible protein spillage into the normally cell-free and protein-poor aqueous humor.\nIridocorneal and iridolenticular adhesions may develop and lead to glaucoma and cataract. Retinal infection concludes with necrosis and lost function. Viral encephalitis and meningitis can result in cranial nerve inflammation and secondary dysfunction of vision and extraocular motility.",

The external surfaces of the eye (conjunctiva and cornea) encounter viruses by both airborne and contact routes. The eyelids, an intermittent barrier, periodically wipe the eye's surface free of debris and spread and drain the preocular tear film. The ability of the tear film to nonspecifically impede primary infection by viruses is unknown, although such mechanisms are well established for bacterial pathogens. An inhibitory effect of goblet cell-derived and intrinsic mucins and meibomian gland-derived lipids on viral adsorption to the ocular surface is speculative. Early in infection, aqueous tears from the main and accessory lacrimal glands furnish proinflammatory cytokines, and the conjunctival blood vessels provide both soluble and cellular components of innate immunity. After viral infection is established, aqueous tears carry lacrimal gland-derived monospecific secretory immunoglobulin A.",

The normal cornea is considered an immune-privileged site due to the high success rate of corneal transplantation; it lacks blood vessels, lymphatics, resident lymphoid cells, and Langerhans cells, expresses Fas ligand on its surface epithelium, and demonstrates reduced delayed hypersensitivity responses. Because corneal inflammation and subsequent scar reduce vision, corneal function is best served by its reduced immunologic responsiveness, also known as immune deviation. Necrotizing inflammation presupposes infection beneath the surface epithelium, and follows chemokine synthesis by infected corneal stromal fibroblasts.\nIn contrast to the cornea, the conjunctiva is well endowed with blood and lymphatic channels, lymphoid cells and Langerhans cells, and demonstrates classical delayed hypersensitivity responses.

Simple follicular conjunctivitis occurs with infection by many adenovirus types and may be subclinical. Pharyngoconjunctival fever typically follows infection with adenovirus types 3, 4, and 7. As the name implies, patients have pharyngitis, conjunctivitis and fever, and may be misdiagnosed as having influenza. Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, most often caused by adenovirus types 8, 19 and 37, is a highly contagious syndrome with significant morbidity. The conjunctivitis can be severe (Fig. 3\n); associated inflammatory conjunctival membranes can permanently scar the eyelids to the globe. Corneal involvement begins as a punctate epithelial keratitis and may proceed to a large central epithelial ulcer. Stromal keratitis presents about 2 weeks after the conjunctivitis as multifocal subepithelial corneal infiltrates, and causes both foreign body sensation and reduced vision. The stromal infiltrates may resolve spontaneously, but can become chronic, require long-term treatment with corticosteroids, and cause persistent visual morbidity. A fourth ocular syndrome occasionally associated with adenovirus infection, AHC (discussed above) may be caused by adenovirus type 11. Interestingly, adenovirus type 11 also causes acute hemorrhagic cystitis. Follicular conjunctivitis clinically indistinguishable from adenovirus conjunctivitis can also be caused by Newcastle disease virus, an RNA virus that gives rise to fatal epidemics in poultry and infects the birds\u2019 human handlers.",

Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of the orbit, although rare overall, occur more frequently in AIDS patients than in the general population. Recently, squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva and cornea has been suggested as a marker for AIDS, but whether HIV infection potentiates HPV-induced carcinogenesis in the eye remains speculative.",

All of the tissues and structures within the eye are susceptible to viral infection, with consequences ranging from mild discomfort to severe pain and blindness, and almost all known human viruses cause ocular disease. Often, the same virus can infect widely disparate tissues within an eye. Classical viral pathogenic mechanisms are readily demonstrated in the eye, but the fine functions of ocular tissues within the visual axis (cornea, anterior chamber, lens, vitreous, and macula) compel altered immune responsiveness. The eye is uniquely affected by viral infection and provides an exceptional model for studies of viral pathogenesis and immunity.",
