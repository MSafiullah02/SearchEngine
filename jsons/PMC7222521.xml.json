Nonetheless, the table provides insight into patients transported and the range of operators, as well as into the operational infection control mechanisms involved. At the moment, there is no pan-European register for reporting numbers of transported COVID-19 patients.\n",

Furthermore, close attention must be paid to every movement, in order to avoid accidental disease transmission (e.g., by touching your own face with contaminated gloves). Therefore, for the aeromedical transport of patients with possible or confirmed COVID-19 on secondary missions (fixed-wing ambulances or long-lasting secondary HEMS missions), the use of a PIU offers substantial benefits, in spite of the higher costs and logistical requirements [5].",

During development, it was successfully tested against infectious agents and liquid penetration using the EN 14126 test method and the EN ISO 17491-3 fixed-wing test, respectively. Altogether, PIU barrier performance proved equal to that provided by protective clothing. Its fixation system allows transportation on any commonly available patient stretcher. The PIU is designed to fit in a fixed-wing ambulance, a medium-sized helicopter, and ground-based ambulances (Fig. 4). Its dimensions are 200 cm*58 cm*63.5 cm. Power for the PIU ventilation is supplied by a rechargeable battery pack (runtime of 8 h) and a 220 V connector.\n",
