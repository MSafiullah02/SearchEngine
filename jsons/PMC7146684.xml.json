Most renal failure patients were immunocompromised due to uremia and needed routine dialysis in hospital two to three times per week. Therefore, renal failure patients should be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 than the normal population. We noticed that, as chest computed tomography scans show, approximately 20\u201330% of dialysis patients were diagnosed with suspected infection in multiple dialysis centers in the early period of COVID-19 outbreak. Intriguingly, most of these suspected cases have no obvious clinical symptoms, including fever, fatigue, and dry cough. However, these asymptomatic patients may be a potential source of infection, transmitting the virus to healthcare providers, their family members, and other patients. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 infection in dialysis patients should be taken more seriously due to a high risk of asymptomatic transmission.",

Moreover, many dialysis patients suffer concurrently from pulmonary edema, which may mimic pneumonia, in terms of both presenting with an abnormal chest radiograph and producing a similar clinical symptom. Nucleic acid test could provide a valuable support, but the sensitivity of the current nucleic acid tests needs to be improved. Given all of the above, the precise diagnosis of COVID-19 infection is more difficult in dialysis patients than in the normal population.",
