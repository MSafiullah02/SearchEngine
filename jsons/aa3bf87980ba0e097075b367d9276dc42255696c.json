[1] [2] [3] As of February 25, 2020, the World Health Organization's situational data indicate~77,780 confirmed cases in 25 countries, including 2,666 deaths due to COVID-19. 4 Most deaths reported so far have been in China. 5 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization have issued interim guidelines to protect the population and to attempt to prevent the further spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from infected individuals. 6 Cities and villages throughout China are unable to accommodate such large numbers of infected individuals while maintaining the quarantine, and several new hospitals have been built to manage the infected individuals. 7 It is imperative that we evaluate novel models to attempt to control the rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2. 8 Technology can assist in faster identification of possible cases to yield more timely interventions.",

Thousands of data points can be processed through an artificial intelligence (AI) framework that can evaluate individuals and stratify them into no risk, minimal risk, moderate risk, and high risk groups.

We call this an \"alert for health check recommendation for COVID-19.\" If the respondent is unable to commute to the health center, the health department can send an alert to a mobile health unit to conduct a door-to-door assessment and even test for the virus.
