However, extensive seroprevalence studies and mass screening for detection of subclinical and non-pneumonic infections are still lacking. At present, the most widely used methods for detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV are indirect immuno-fluorescence assay and ELISA with cell-culture extract.1, 5 However, antibody detection by these methods is difficult to standardise and has not been compared with recombinant-antigen-based antibody-detection tests. A recent seroprevalence study, which used the indirect immunofluorescence assay for antibody detection, did not detect SARS-CoV antibodies in any of 674 health-care workers from a hospital in which a SARS outbreak had occurred.13\n",

The test was modified from our previous publications.15, 17 Briefly, each well of a Nunc immunoplate (Roskilde, Denmark) was coated with 20 ng purified (His)6-tagged recombinant nucleocapsid protein for 12 h, then blocked in phosphate-buffered saline with 2% bovine serum albumin. 100 \u03bcL diluted human serum (1 in 40) was added to each well of the protein-coated plates, and they were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. After five washes with washing buffer, 100 \u03bcL horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated goat antibody to human IgG (1 in 4000 dilution; Zymed Laboratories Inc, South San Francisco, CA, USA) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. After a further five washes with washing buffer, 100 \u03bcL diluted 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine (Zymed Laboratories) was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. 100 L 0\u00b73 mol/L sulphuric acid was added, and the absorbance at 450 nm of each well was measured. Each sample was tested in duplicate, and the mean absorbance for each sample was calculated. The presence of specific antibodies in positive samples was confirmed by retesting of the sample by the ELISA based on recombinant nucleocapsid protein and western-blot assays with recombinant nucleocapsid protein and recombinant spike polypeptide separately.",

Six (5\u00b77%) serum samples that were seropositive by the immunofluorescence assay were negative by the ELISA. The reason for this discrepancy may be that the nucleocapsid protein did not elicit antibody response in this minority group of patients. Conversely, of five patients with SARS-CoV pneumonia who were seronegative by the immunofluorescence assay but RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV, two were seropositive by our ELISA, with clearly positive optical-density values of 0\u00b7874 and 1\u00b7228 and confirmation by western-blot assay (unpublished). Furthermore, in four of 20 patients with SARS coronavirus pneumonia who had serial serum samples, IgG was detected earlier by the ELISA than by the immunofluorescence test (unpublished). In another study that used ELISA based on cell-culture extract, five of 15 patients with SARS-CoV pneumonia were positive according to that ELISA but negative by indirect immunofluorescence during the time when the ELISA titres were low.5 This finding accords with the results of a previous study on human coronavirus 229E, which showed that three of 51 serum samples were positive by recombinant-nucleocapsid-protein-based western blot but negative by immunofluorescence, and six of 51 serum samples were positive by immunofluorescence but negative by recombinant-nucleocapsid-protein-based western blot.26 All these findings show that our ELISA may be able to detect additional cases that the immuno-fluorescence assay has missed.",

The spike polypeptide was used in addition to the nucleocapsid protein for western-blot confirmation to eliminate the possibility of cross-reactivity between antibodies against the nucleocapsid proteins of other human coronaviruses and that of SARS-CoV. However, the aminoacid identities between the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV and those of the human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E are only 32\u00b77% and 21\u00b73%, respectively, and there were no cross-reactions between 13 pairs of OC43 and 14 pairs of 229E human coronavirus serum samples and the SARS-CoV.5 In fact, of the 33 individuals who were IgG positive by ELISA, 26 (79%) were positive by the nucleocapsid-protein-based western-blot assay, but only four were positive by both the nucleocapsid protein and the spike polypeptide western-blot assays. This apparent high rate of false-positive non-pneumonic cases, as detected by the recombinant nucleocapsid protein ELISA, is due to the use of a single antigen for screening asymptomatic or non-pneumonic infections. It is well known that the positive predictive values of serological tests are much affected when the prevalence of the infection is low, especially in clinically incompatible cases. This is the reason why an immunologically unrelated antigen, the spike protein, has to be used for confirmation of the cases detected as \u201cpositive\u201d by the nucleocapsid-protein-based assays. Cross-reactivity with human coronavirus OC43 or other SARS-CoV-like viruses remains an important issue for future studies on SARS-CoV serology. Three of the four individuals with non-pneumonic SARS-CoV infections were healthy blood donors, and one was a paediatric inpatient. This patient was a 19-month-old girl who was admitted to hospital in May, 2003, because of fever for 2 days. She was also noted to have had a cough for the previous 2 weeks and repeated vomiting before admission. There had been no breathing difficulty or diarrhoea. The child had no history of direct contact with patients with SARS-CoV pneumonia. However, a colleague in her mother's workplace had recently been diagnosed as having SARS-CoV pneumonia. Physical examination of the girl revealed only shotty (palpable but too small to be measured) cervical lymph nodes and congested throat. Her chest radiograph was normal. Apart from mild lymphopenia (lymphocyte count 0\u00b763\u00d7 109/L), her blood results were normal. Nasopharyngeal aspirate was negative for influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus antigens.27 She was given antipyretic treatment and was discharged the next day. Subsequent antibody testing showed that her serum was positive for both IgG and IgM antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein as well as IgG antibodies against the spike polypeptide of SARS-CoV.",
