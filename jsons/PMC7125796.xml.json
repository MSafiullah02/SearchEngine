Since the antiviral activities against single or small groups of viruses have been poorly characterized, there has not been enough information to fully understand their role as host defense mechanisms. More recently, molecules possessing broad antiviral activity in the body have been better characterized and also may be considered as potentially effective defenses against viral infections.

Virus plaque-inhibiting activity appeared in culture fluids within a few hours after incubation of cultures with fresh medium. Peak inhibitory activity occurred within 24 h. Blockade of cellular ribonucleic acid or protein synthesis decreased the appearance of the inhibitor. Inhibition of virus required the simultaneous presence of inhibitor, virus, and cells, suggesting the reversible nature of the inhibition (Hughes et al., 1981). The degree of inhibitory activity depended on the animal species of origin of the inhibitor, the cell type used for the assay, and the virus type used for challenge. No cell species barrier against inhibitory action was found. Strong inhibition of multicycle yields of vesicular stomatitis virus and Sindbis virus was caused even by low doses of the inhibitor. Characterization of CVI with respect to molecular size and stability to heat and a number of chemical reagents and enzymes indicate that the antiviral activity of CVI is (a) associated with a large molecule (approximately 4 million Da), (b) stable at 100\u00b0C, and (c) resistant to the action of RNase, DNase, sulfhydral reagents, protein denaturants, and extraction by organic solvents (Sullivan et al., 1987). These characteristics are specific for CVI (Singh and Baron, 2000). Similar inhibitors occur in certain tissue extracts and body fluids (described later).",

Antiviral activity in urine can be accounted for by the ammonium ion concentration. The basis for this conclusion is twofold. First, the physical characteristics and biological mechanisms of the urine inhibitor are similar to those of authentic NH4\n+. Second, the quantity of ammonium salts normally present in urine is sufficient to explain the level of antiviral activity in this physiologic fluid. The ammonium ion concentration in other body fluids is much lower than that in urine, and their content of NH4\n+ does not generally inhibit viruses (Tietz, 1983). In addition, ammonium salts are distinct from the previously reported antiviral mucoprotein in urine (Tamm and Horsfall, 1952).",

In addition, a sulfhydryl reagent (DTT) and a chaotropic reagent (urea) were used to treat the inhibitor preparation, and no loss of antiviral activity was found. Thus, the inhibitor is resistant to many chemical degradations.",

            "text": "The oral cavity is unique among mucosal surfaces in having a defensive barrier to transmission of HIV and probably to the related human T-cell leukemia virus (Mohor, 1973, Phillips and Bourinbaiar, 1992, Milman and Sharma, 1994, Bomsel, 1997, Zacharopoulos and Phillips, 1997). The main defense mechanism appears to be inactivation of the transmitting leukocytes by the hypotonicity of saliva. Additional protection may be contributed by the other less active salivary inhibitors (Coppenhaver et al., 1984, Fultz, 1986, Fox et al., 1988, Fox et al., 1989, Archibald and Cole, 1990, Yeh et al., 1992, Bergey et al., 1994, McNeely et al., 1995, McNeely et al., 1997, Wahl and Orenstein, 1997, Crombie et al., 1998). This salivary defense appears to explain the rarity of casual HIV transmission orally. However, the normally effective oral barrier can be overcome by the solutes in seminal fluid, milk, and colostrums (Mayer and DeGruttola, 1987, Lifson et al., 1990, Quatro et al., 1990, Lane et al., 1991, Ryder et al., 1991, Dunn et al., 1992, Keet et al., 1992, Bertolli et al., 1996, Black, 1996, Berrey and Shea, 1997, Cao et al., 1997).",

Consequently, anticellular solutions that are more potent than saliva's hypotonicity could be applied topically at the vulnerable mucosal sites (e.g. vagina and rectum) to inactivate infected leukocytes in seminal fluid. To prevent the vaginal and rectal transmission, studies of candidate topical anticellular substances (Baron, 2000), other than the reportedly ineffective nonoxynol-9 (Mohor, 1973, Pauza et al., 1993, Pauza et al., 1994), are being done. These candidate preventives include disinfectants for blood products, bile detergents, and over-the-counter (OTC) commercial vaginal products, which are effective in vitro. Some of these OTC products are already established to be safe for use by FDA standards.",

            "text": "When the HIV epidemic began, an initial concern was that HIV might be transmitted casually from the oral secretions of the millions of HIV carriers during kissing, dental treatment, biting, and aerosolization. Later it became clear that casual transmission is actually a rare event, even when infectious HIV is shed into the oral cavity by bleeding and exudation (Ho et al., 1985, Levy and Greenspan, 1988, Rogers et al., 1990, Gooch et al., 1993, Moore et al., 1993, Richman and Rickman, 1993, Yeung et al., 1993, Piazza et al., 1994). Saliva of infected individuals usually contains only non-infectious components of HIV, including viral DNA, indicating that the saliva may cause a breakdown of infected leukocytes. The infectivity of these salivas in vitro is only 1%, although all carriers have infectious virus in their blood (Goto et al., 1991, Barr et al., 1992, Moore et al., 1993, Coppenhaver et al., 1994, Qureshi et al., 1995, Melvin et al., 1997, Baron et al., 1999). In comparison, in seminal fluid the percentage of patients shedding HIV, mainly as infected leukocytes, is much higher \u2014 approximately 20% (Milman and Sharma, 1994, Vernazza et al., 1996, Zhu et al., 1996). Thus the rarity of casual oral transmission correlates with the low infectivity of saliva compared to the high infectivity of seminal fluid, which is associated with 27% vaginal transmission (European Study Group, 1989, Johnson et al., 1989, Lazzarin et al., 1991, European Study Group on Heterosexual Transmission of HIV, 1992, Royce et al., 1997). It is, therefore, important to determine the salivary mechanisms of protection.",

This hypotonicity was shown to disrupt the crucial infected leukocytes and thereby render them incapable of supporting virus multiplication and cell-to-cell transmission of HIV (Fig. 5\n). Specifically, there was a 10 000-fold inhibition of the multiplication of HIV by the hypotonicity of saliva compared to the only 3- to 5-fold inhibition by the macromolecular inhibitors in saliva (Baron et al., 1999, Baron et al., 2000). Also, reconstitution of the isotonicity of saliva reversed its inhibition (Baron et al., 1999). Thus, hypotonic disruption appears to be a major mechanism by which saliva kills the transmitting mononuclear leukocytes and thereby prevents their attachment to mucosal epithelial cells and their production of infectious HIV.",

The mechanisms by which the carrier's seminal fluid or milk may overcome protection by the recipient's saliva was studied (Baron et al., 2000). It was hypothesized that reconstitution of salts in hypotonic saliva by orally deposited isotonic seminal fluid, milk, or colostrum would reverse saliva's ability to inactivate its virus-infected leukocytes (Girgis et al., 1980, Kavanagh, 1985, Mehl, 1986, Levy, 1988, Vonesch et al., 1992, Buranasin et al., 1993, Goldman and Goldblum, 1996). Experimentally, the volumes of seminal fluid, milk, or colostrum deposited in the mouth were found to contain sufficient solutes to overcome saliva's normal hypotonic protection against HIV-infected leukocytes and thereby appear to explain the paradoxically successful oral transmission by these fluids (Fig. 6\n). This conclusion was confirmed by the reversal of salivary protection by adding salts to saliva and by dialysis with culture medium.",

The inset shows the calibration of the column. Reprinted with permission from the J. Biol. Regul. Homeost. Agents, 1993, 7: 9.",
