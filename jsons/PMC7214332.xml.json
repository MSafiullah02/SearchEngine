            "text": "As an institutional arrangement of financial globalization, the opening of a capital account by countries since the 1990s has vastly improved the depth and breadth of financial globalization. Nevertheless, the recent international situation has become increasingly complicated. Issues on the reemergence of trade protectionism and fall of petroleum prices could reduce the total trade surplus of the world economy, thereby shrinking the liquidity of the US dollar worldwide. Although the newly initiated quantitative easing by US Federal Reserve in response to the COVID-19 pandemic can serve as a tool to inject liquidity into the world capital market mainly through security investment, the real effect, which is determined by the nature of security capital, could be limited and volatile. Moreover, the international financial market could experience huge and frequent fluctuations. In a situation with increasing economic and political uncertainty, the capital account liberalization (CAL) strategy of emerging economies could change. As the largest trading country and holder of international reserves, CAL policy choices in China are essential and could generate demonstration effects for other emerging markets. The financial globalization can be influenced deeply and even reversed. Examining whether and how China can benefit from CAL is essential to evaluate the CAL policy orientation.",

Factors such as financial distortion could weaken and even destroy the availability of such benefit (Eichengreen and Leblang, 2003). However, CAL can likewise be a source of economic instability and magnify distortions (Wei, 2018). As the largest developing country in the world, China has adopted a positive attitude toward CAL following the RMB exchange rate reform. In recent years, the Chinese government has implemented various CAL policies to open the country\u2019s capital account progressively. The RMB Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors (RQFII) program, which is a policy initiative allowing international investors holding an RQFII quota unprecedented access to Chinese onshore equity and fixed income securities markets, was announced by Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang during the Forum on the 12th Five-Year Plan and Mainland\u2013Hong Kong Economic, Trade and Financial Cooperation on August 17, 2011. An increasing number of foreign institutions have applied for RQFII qualification. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange of China announced on December 29, 2018 that 205 foreign institutions from 15 countries (or regions) were approved as RQFII investors, with the aggregate quota reaching 646.672 billion RMB.",

Specifically, we analyze the stock market response to the symbolic event, that is, the RQFII policy announcement, and use August 17, 2011 as the event date. Employing an event-study approach and a sample comprising Chinese listed firms, our empirical analysis yields several interesting findings. Overall, we find that the stock market responded significantly positively to the RQFII announcement. The positive cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) suggest that the CAL policy is beneficial on average. Next, we conduct regression analyses to examine the potential determinants of CARs, specifically, financing constraints. Our regression results indicate a certain level of heterogeneity that firms with more stringent financing constraints earn higher returns than their counterparts. We argue that this finding is because the market expects the RQFII announcement, as a CAL tool, to provide overseas financing opportunities for firms, especially those with financing constraints.",

We create a measure for quality of local institutions using the province-level marketization index, which is maintained by the National Economic Research Institute (NERI; Fan et al., 2003, Fan et al., 2011), to gauge the extent of marketization. Moreover, we provide additional evidence that firms\u2019 return differentials are significantly high when firms are located in provinces with high-quality local institutions. In other words, firms with tight financing constraints gain from CAL when the quality of local institutions is high. This finding is because firms located in places with high-quality domestic institutions can allocate resources efficiently, thereby alleviating the twin agency problems (Stultz 2005).",

In their study, the authors provided evidence for the significant decline of CARs of Brazilian firms following the imposition of capital controls on equity flows and found that large firms and exporting firms suffer less from capital controls. Our study sheds light on this strand of research on the opposite side of capital control, thereby providing firm-level evidence of CAL from the perspective of financing constraints.",

The twin agency problems (Stultz 2005) may nudge the composition of cross-border capital inflows to consist of less foreign direct investments or shorten the maturity of external debts (Wei, 2018). Specifically, Wei (2000) showed that countries with severe corruption systematically attract less foreign direct investment. Employing firm-level and cross-country data, Wei and Zhou (2018) found that weak public governance tends to reduce the share of external equity financing in total investments. Our study is consistent with this line of research and provides evidence that high-quality local institutions help firms gain increased benefits from CAL, especially those with tight financing constraints.",

            "text": "Traditional international capital flow theory (Meade, 1952; Mundell, 1960) states that international capital flows from countries with relatively low interest rates to those with high interest rates. Capital generally flows from rich to poor countries (Lucas, 1990) and stimulates poor countries\u2019 economic growth or promotes their financial development. However, results are mixed when the relationship between the CAL policy and economic growth is considered. After analyzing financial crisis prevention and markets\u2019 response to capital control at the national and international levels, Summers (2000) recognized that controls on international capital flows tend to be ineffective, raise costs, and create distortions. Removing restrictions on capital flows and placing high priority on efficient capital markets should be a necessary step in the process of domestic and international capital liberalization for emerging countries. Henry, 2000, Henry, 2003 demonstrated that the growth rate in output per worker rises by 2.3 percentage points, the rate of capital stock increases by 1.1 percentage points per year, and aggregate dividend yield falls by 240 basic points when emerging economies open their stock markets to foreign investors. By contrast, CAL increases competition in the domestic financial sector and is deemed detrimental to local banks in poor countries (Claessens and Huizinga, 2001). However, current research on CAL and economic growth is mainly from the macro perspective. In our study, we use firm-level financing constraints to measure the degree of micro-level capital shortages and employ the stock market response to reflect the expectation of firms utilizing overseas funds from the CAL policy. Thus, we present the following hypothesis.Hypothesis 1: Firms with more stringent financing constraints earn higher stock returns than their counterparts.\n",

A strong institutional environment with creditors\u2019 rights, contract enforcement, and satisfactory accounting standards is important for countries benefiting from financial liberalization (Eichengreen et al., 2011). In addition to the international institutional environment, the quality of domestic institutions is particularly important for firms to gain benefits from CAL, especially in economies with low-quality institutions (Ding et al., 2018, Ju and Wei, 2011). One possible reason is that a distorted domestic institution can lead to twin agency problems in which controlling shareholders can use their power to expropriate outside investors for private benefits, and government officials may use their power to improve their personal welfare at the expense of the shareholders (Wei, 2018). Hence, we can conjecture that a place or region with a superior institutional environment can help firms with financing constraints better utilize overseas funds from the CAL policy. Thus, we present the following hypothesis.Hypothesis 2: CAL announcement returns depend on local institutions and are high for (financing-constraint) firms located in provinces with a highly market-oriented environment.\n",

By manually tracking their curriculum vitae, we can identify whether a TMT or board member holds a secretarial position in the party committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC). Party membership can entail political connections that help firms relax production process constraints and positively affect firms\u2019 profitability (Li et al., 2008). If a TMT or board member is currently (or previously) a secretary of the CPC, then he/she is identified as a politically connected member.
