These components make a more attractive tool for AMS, in comparison to standard respiratory cultures.5 However, there is conflicting evidence for beneficial impact on clinical outcomes and resource utilization such as decreased antibiotic duration of therapy and hospital length of stay.5, 6, 7 The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact on antimicrobial utilization following implementation of an in\u2010house RVP, coupled with AMS audit and feedback, in immunocompromised patients.",

Send\u2010out RVP testing was utilized in RVS1 (October 2014\u2014April 2015) without AMS audit. The following year (RVS2, October 2015\u2014April 2016), an in\u2010house RVP that detected 20 respiratory pathogens (BioFire FilmArray RP\u00ae, Salt Lake City, UT, USA) was implemented with concurrent weekday AMS calls to providers. Multidisciplinary education for the use of the in\u2010house RVP was presented and distributed prior to RVS2, and a prospective audit and feedback of RVP results was piloted with rounding pharmacists and the AMS service. The RVP was analyzed in\u2010house from 7 am to 11 pm daily. All transplant patients and patients with immunocompromising conditions in the ICU with respiratory tract infections, tested with a RVP, were included. Pneumonia diagnosis was at the discretion of the critical care or transplant team, as per documentation in progress and discharge summaries. \u201cImmunocompromised\u201d was defined as those with solid organ transplant (SOT), hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), ANC < 1000 cells/cc, CD4 count < 200 cells/cc, or receiving other immunosuppressive/cytotoxic therapy (alkylating agents, anthracyclines, mTOR and calcineurin inhibitors, thymoglobulin, TNF\u2010alpha inhibitors, CTLA\u20104 agonists, and corticosteroids equivalent to at least 2 weeks of prednisone 20 mg daily). Patients < 18 years of age, and those who were pregnant or had death or discharge prior to the result of the RVP, were excluded. Time from specimen collection to final result in the electronic medical record was defined as turnaround time. The study was powered to an effect size of 0.5 in turnaround time between RVS1 and RVS2 with a 2\u2010sided alpha of 0.05 and power of 0.80, which yielded a sample size of 176 patients.5 Outcomes of interest were empiric antimicrobial duration of therapy, hospital length of stay, time to an intervention. Interventions consisted of antimicrobial optimization via de\u2010escalation/discontinuation of antibiotic, initiation/discontinuation of antiviral, or modification of immunosuppressive regimen, beginning from collection of specimen and up to 48 hours following the RVP result. Empiric duration of therapy was defined as antibiotic therapy for pneumonia prior to RVP result and/or targeted therapy interventions. Chi\u2010square was used for categorical variables and Mann\u2013Whitney\u2010U was used for continuous non\u2010parametric variables. Factors associated with antimicrobial optimization were examined in a bivariate analysis. SPSS Version 22\u00ae was used for statistical analyses.",

            "text": "Rapid diagnostic testing is quickly becoming an influential aspect of stewardship models and has been recommended in practice guidelines for initiating an AMS program.4 We analyzed 75 immunocompromised patients who were tested with an in\u2010house RVP after AMS implementation, which led to significant reductions in turnaround time and time\u2010to\u2010intervention, and increased diagnostic yield compared to 56 patients with send\u2010out RVP testing. The broader respiratory panel PCR in RVS2 (included coronaviruses and human metapneumovirus) compared to RVS1 likely contributed to this yield. However, there was little indication that the management of these patients was significantly modified on the basis of improved diagnostic certainty with an in\u2010house RVP, as no differences between groups for duration of therapy, length of stay, or interventions between RVS1 and RVS2 were observed. Increased diagnostic certainty may result in faster discharge, as patients with positive RVP had shorter length of stay than those with negative RVP; yet the infrequent de\u2010escalation of antibiotics (14%) in this group was comparable to previous findings.5 Suspected coinfection, critical status, increased oxygen requirements, specific radiographic findings, or other pending cultures may contribute to antibiotic continuation. In a recent prospective, multicenter surveillance study of community acquired pneumonia, the majority of pathogens isolated (by nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal PCR, urinary antigen, or culture) in hospitalized patients with pneumonia are respiratory viruses, with a low (3%) incidence of bacterial\u2010viral co\u2010infection.2 This population excluded immunocompromised individuals, and such a study would provide important context on current patterns in pneumonia for transplant patients and antimicrobial decision making. Only 1.5% of our population had confirmed coinfection and there were no differences in de\u2010escalation between ICU and non\u2010ICU populations. It is not surprising that bacterial pneumonia was a negative predictor of antimicrobial adjustment, but a similar association with renal transplant patients was an unexpected finding. Appropriate antimicrobial management may be further streamlined with targeted educational efforts towards healthcare provider leaders and staff.8\n",

Methods were designed to capture appropriate RVP utility but potential opportunities may exist in patients who were not tested as well. During a select timeframe in RVS2, 251 hospitalized patients with SOT were diagnosed with a respiratory tract infection and only 27 had RVP testing. Our study sample was limited to a heterogeneous critically ill immunocompromised and/or transplant patients tested with the RVP, and did not reach the intended initial sample size within the study time frame, although an 8.5\u2010fold difference in turnaround time was observed.

            "text": "Seasonality presents another challenge. Most interventions were driven by the presence or absence of influenza (addition or discontinuation of oseltamivir); pathogens such as respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus were rarely isolated. These results also suggest that, if institutionally available, a molecular influenza test can be utilized prior to RVP if there are major cost differences and similar turnaround time. Bacterial pneumonia was confirmed with inpatient diagnosis by the rounding team and culture growth of pathogen from lower respiratory samples. The in\u2010house RVP in the present study uses nasopharyngeal samples to detect viruses in addition to M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and B. pertussis. While a high quality lower respiratory sample with PCR testing may provide greater confidence for presence or absence of pathogens in pneumonia, this technology is not yet widely available or practical for all patients and institutions. As RVPs gain popularity in practice, judicious use in patient populations and interpretation of respective results should be taken into higher consideration to optimize antimicrobial management and cost of care. Improved diagnostic yield and turnaround time, which may be a surrogate for ancillary testing and laboratory labor, may still justify RVP use; but will RVPs consistently be used as a de\u2010escalation tool rather than additional academic information? Further investigation on AMS and resource utilization are warranted in critically ill immunocompromised and transplant patients.",
