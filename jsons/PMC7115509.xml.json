            "text": "Over the last decade, there has been a remarkable increase in epidemics around the world. Healthcare workers form the leading group that is affected by these epidemics. As a large portion of healthcare personnel, nurses have proximity with infected individuals, and this puts them at higher risk of being exposed to contagious diseases (Bernard et al., 2009; Branch-Elliman et al., 2015; International Council of Nurses [ICN], 2016). During the worldwide epidemic of early 2003, healthcare workers accounted for a large proportion of persons with severe acute respiratory syndrome (Park et al., 2004). In recent years, during the Ebola disease outbreak in West Africa, 815 of healthcare workers infected with Ebola and two thirds of them died, >50% were nurses (ICN, 2016). Also out of the epidemics, healthcare workers were affected by occupational exposures. Kuncio et al. stated that pediatric health workers were often exposed to pertussis due to inadequate infection control measures (Kuncio et al., 2014). From the perspective of patients, infections stemming from healthcare not only increase their health expenses, but also constitute a significant risk factor for morbidity and mortality (Luangasanatip et al., 2015; World Health Organization [WHO], 2016). More than 2.5 million cases of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) occur in the Europe, total burden of HAIs in the EU of 501 DALYs per 100,000 people (Cassini et al., 2016), 4.0% of inpatients in U.S. acute care hospitals had at least one HAI (Ray et al., 2015).",

            "text": "On the other hand, it is for sure that hand hygiene (HH) is the most important of all control measures against all infections for both healthcare personnel and patient safety (WHO, 2009; Sax et al., 2007; Allegranzi and Pittet, 2009). World Health Organization suggests that alcohol based handrub (AHR) should be used as the first choice for hand hygiene of nonsoiled hands to safer care. If hands are visibly dirty or when exposure to potential spore-forming organisms, they need to be washed with soap and water (Boyce and Pittet, 2002; WHO, 2009). Despite its ease and extensive regulations on HH, studies show that compliance with HH is below the desired level among nurses (Allegranzi and Pittet, 2009; Ward et al., 2014; Azim et al., 2016). The reasons that prevent compliance with HH are: increased care-giving and limited time for hand-washing, hand irritation, allergy to chemicals, insufficient supplies and resources and lack of knowledge, experience and education (\u00c7elik and Ko\u00e7a\u015fli, 2008; Hynes, 2015). Compliance with HH practices among nursing students is at lower levels than expectations similar to nurses (Van De Mortel et al., 2012; Nair et al., 2014; Av\u015far et al., 2015). During clinical applications, due to direct patient contact or contaminant surfaces and devices, both nursing students and their patients are facing increasing the risk of healthcare-associated infections because of lack of knowledge, skills and experience (\u00c7elik and Ko\u00e7a\u015fli, 2008; Av\u015far et al., 2015). Improving the education of nursing students is an effective and sustainable strategy for increasing nurses' compliance with HH. Furthermore, it is important to prevent health care-associated infections.",

The study followed these stages to calculate the entire hand surface: distal phalanges (1a, 2a, 3a, 4a, 5a), intermediate-proximal phalanges (1b, 2b, 3b, 4b, 5b) and the areas where the metacarpal (metacarpal I area- close to fingers)- carpal bones, (metacarpal II area - far from the fingers) are located were measured by a tape measure to identify the palmar and dorsal surface of the right and left hands (Fig. 1\n). The surface of each hand was calculated in terms of cm2, and these measurements were later turned into percentages. The dorsal/palmar surface and their percentages were: thumb, 22 cm2 14.5%; 2nd, 3rd, 4th fingers, 40.5 cm2, 27%; little finger, 11 cm2, 7.5%, metacarpal area near fingers, 36 cm2, 24%; metacarpal and carpal area away from the fingers, 40.5 cm2, 27%; and the total area, 150 cm2, 100%. The projection of 100 was transformed into 1.000 for the convenience of researchers analyzing photographs on the computer. The entire dorsal and palmar surfaces of right and left hands were evaluated out of 4.000 points (Fig. 1). Considering that the percentage distribution of individuals with different hand sizes may vary, measurements were carried out for two men and two women with different hand sizes. Since the difference was only 1%, the same percentage was used for all participants. If the total percentage of all hand surfaces covered with fluorescence was below 75%, disinfectant use was deemed insufficient. For this reason, hand-washing was not calculated for these individuals.",

It has been reported that AHR use is more effective than washing hands with water and soap (Boyce and Pittet, 2002; Picheansathian, 2004). Voss and Widmer's study demonstrates that standard practice of washing hands with water and soap in 100% compliance with HH takes 56 min (Vos and Widmer, 1997). If the same practice is carried out with hand-rub, the duration falls to 18 min. Azim et al. recently showed that this duration is between 9 and 13.5 min in 12-hour shifts (Azim et al., 2016). Disseminating alcohol hand rubs to nursing students who have high frequencies and durations of contact with patients in clinical practices is an appropriate approach to ensuring effective time management in health care.",

Fuller et al. conducted an observational study that claims using gloves significantly decreases HH practices (Fuller et al., 2011). Like previous studies, our research showed that one of every 20 students found washing hands unnecessary when using gloves (Amin et al., 2013; Ratcliffe and Smith, 2014). Any training for developing hand-washing behavior relies on the adoption of this behavior. This requires changing nursing students' attitudes and eliminating misinformation. Like the scholarly literature, this research found that one of the factors that hinder HH compliance is the belief that washing hands regularly will dry and irritate hands (Boyce and Pittet, 2002; Van De Mortel et al., 2012). One way to overcome this bias may be to explain students that HAS is less damaging when used by adding glycerol and similar emollients and should be preferred when there is no visible dirt on hands (Picheansathian, 2004). Showing the students' hand surfaces covered with fluorescent traces and informing them about micro organismic colonization on surfaces that are not covered with fluorescent remains could be an effective education tool for overcoming the deficiencies in HAS and developing a positive attitude towards HH (Picheansathian, 2004; \u0160kodov\u00e1 et al., 2015).",

It has been reported that AHR use in HH is influenced by characteristics such as the type of solution, duration of contact and the amount used (Kampf et al., 2008; Zingg et al., 2016). In our research, the students used AHR\u2014just like in the clinic\u2014in the amounts they chose for themselves. The researchers did not interfere in this matter. The WHO (2009) describes standard hand-washing without identifying any particular amount. It suggests that alcohol-based hand scrub should be used to cover the entire hand surface, and that the hands should be scrubbed for 20\u201330 s. The WHO recommends washing hands according to standard procedures with water and soap for 40\u201360 s when there is visible dirt on hands. Although the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control suggests 30 s of hand-washing, there are studies showing the insufficiency of this duration for HH (Kampf et al., 2008; Zingg et al., 2016).",

            "text": "\u0160kodov\u00e1 et al. showed that the distribution of fluorescent traces was the highest on the right and left hand palms and lowest on the thumbs. Our research findings do not indicate any difference between right and left hands in terms of disinfectant distribution. Like \u0160kodov\u00e1 et al. and Hautemanie're et al., palmar surfaces were covered with HAS in a more appropriate way than dorsal surfaces (Hautemani\u00e8re et al., 2009; \u0160kodov\u00e1 et al., 2015). This may stem from the amount of solution used (Kampf et al., 2008; Zingg et al., 2016). Zingg et al. noted that 2 ml of AHR may be sufficient for palmar surfaces of medium and large hands, but not enough for dorsal surfaces (Kampf et al., 2008). As \u0160kodov\u00e1 et al. show, our finding that men's hands were covered with less HAS may be due to their hand sizes. In this research, the lowest points for dorsal surfaces of both hands were identified on surfaces near the wrist and thumbs. In curricula, students should be informed about hand antiseptic use and the practice of hand-washing in line with the WHO's regulations. Although the WHO suggests an 8-stage regulation of hand disinfectant use, Kampf et al. have proposed a new and less detailed 5-stage technique. This new rub-in technique, which aims to prevent the omission of frequently missed surfaces in HH, may be considered as an alternative technique to the WHO's regulations. Thumbs are cleaned in the later stages of the WHO's regulation, while Kampf et al. does so in the third stage. The right palm is described in the third stage of the WHO's regulation. Yet, here it is possible to omit the surface near the wrist. In the fourth stage of the new technique, both the dorsum of the hand and wrists may be covered with disinfectant by positioning and scrubbing the palmar surface of one hand to cover the metacarpal surface on the wrist of the other hand (Kampf et al., 2008). However, there is a need for comparison of both techniques' efficacy.",

They also show that there is no significant relationship between bacterial colonization and the amount of Glo Germs that remain on the hands. This may be related to the fact that analysis took place in daylight. It is not possible to identify the boundaries of fluorescent traces on the hands without dimming the environment. Therefore, appropriate arrangement of the environment is significant for accurate analysis (Hautemani\u00e8re et al., 2009).",
