            "text": "Animal health governance faces new challenges as the ecology of infectious livestock diseases is changing (Tomley and Shirley 2009) . Environmental and climate changes, intensification of livestock production, modification in land-use and agricultural practices, globalization of human travel, the development of the trade of livestock and livestock products have created conditions for an increase in the emergence and re-emergence of infectious agents in the last decades (Weiss and McMichael 2004; Randolph and Rogers 2010; Jones et al. 2008; Gibbs 2005) . The frequency of emergence of new highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) has increased over the past 20 years, as well as the economic impact of associated outbreaks (Alexander and Brown 2009) . Bluetongue virus serotypes have continuously increased their spatial distribution, specifically in a northern direction. Treatment-resistant strains, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), have appeared. Numerous infectious diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) are endemic in many parts of the world, and may have a high impact on animal health and farmer livelihood. Moreover, they constrain the ability of affected countries to trade livestock and livestock-derived products. Production systems in developed countries are also vulnerable. For example, outbreaks of FMD in United Kingdom in 2001, classical swine fever in Holland in 1997/1998, and highly pathogenic avian influenza H7N7 in Holland in 2003 resulted in the loss of millions of animals, mainly as a result of culling of affected and exposed animals. Finally, infectious livestock diseases are a threat for public health: about 75% of human infectious agents that emerged in the last 25 years had an animal origin (King et al. 2006) .",

            "text": "To meet these challenges, transparent scientific approaches are needed to obtain a better understanding of epidemiological patterns and to inform policydevelopment. Epidemiological systems are composed of multiple processes interacting nonlinearly. They are thus too complex to be represented using purely mental thought processes. The ability of humans to mentally conceptualize a system seems to be reached when more than three variables and six transitions from a state to another are involved (Klein 1998) . Therefore, the study of epidemiological systems can benefit significantly from the use of quantitative modeling tools. By integrating individual animal-level knowledge of epidemiological, biological and behavioral factors, mathematical models of infectious diseases can provide insights into disease dynamics at the population-level and predictions of the impact of control strategies on outbreak outcome. Their mathematical formulation makes the underlying assumptions explicit, thereby ensuring the transparency of the approach, at least to those with the relevant understanding of the underlying mathematical methodologies. According to the Royal Society's Infectious diseases in Livestock report (Society 2002) , \"Quantitative modeling is one of the essential tools both for developing strategies in preparation for an outbreak and for predicting and evaluating the effectiveness of control policies during an outbreak.\"",

They are a simplification of a complex phenomenon, but the simplification should have a limited effect on the disease dynamics properties, which are under study (Britton and Lindenstrand 2009) . Models can be used either to simulate disease spread, they are then referred to as simulation models, or to estimate epidemiological parameters. Simulation models use existing knowledge regarding the spread of infection and host population dynamics to investigate mechanisms underlying disease spread, or to predict the future trajectory of an epidemic and the impact of control strategies. Alternatively, given assumptions as to the nature of transmission, models can quantitatively estimate key transmission parameters retrospectively from existing outbreak or experimental infection data.",

Allowing identification of the underlying factors that drive disease dynamics, these models can thus be used to generate and to test hypotheses.

In the field of livestock diseases, models of the spread of diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, scrapie and classical swine fever have all been developed to address pertinent issues regarding ongoing epidemics such as optimal culling strategies, farming restrictions, and the impact upon human health (Anderson et al. 1996; Ferguson et al. 1998; Boender et al. 2008) . The 2001 FMD epidemic in Great Britain further served to demonstrate that, following advances in computing power and given access to the best available data (Levin et al. 1997) , mathematical models can play an active role in providing policy makers with vital information as to the optimum disease control strategy during a rapidly progressing epidemic (Ferguson et al. 2001; Keeling et al. 2001 ). However, how useful this information was is still debated, since modeling outputs might have led to an excessive slaughtering of uninfected animals (Kitching et al. 2006) .",

Simulation models have been developed to get a better understanding of factors driving the disease spread, such as the potential role played by environmental transmission in the maintenance of avian influenza viruses in natural ecosystems (Lebarbenchon et al. 2009; Guberti et al. 2007; Roche et al. 2009 ); and the impact of poultry population management on the silent spread of HPAIV strain type H5N1 viruses in live bird markets (Fourni\u00e9 et al. 2010 ). Further models have been developed to investigate direct and indirect effects of control measures, including the hypothesis that large-scale culling campaigns may impede the evolution of avian host resistance to the virus (Shim et al. 2009 ), and the evolution and spread of resistance following vaccination campaigns (Iwami et al. 2009a, b) . At the farm level, models allowed evaluating the impact of different mortality and morbidity thresholds for the detection of infection (Savill et al. 2006; Carpenter et al. 2004 ) and investigating the use of sentinel birds for detecting the emergence of HPAIV (Verdugo et al. 2009 ). The potential for infection to spread silently in vaccinated populations, as a result of lower levels of clinical signs and flock mortality (Savill et al. 2006 ) within a commercial flock, and the dynamics of waning immunity in backyard systems (Lesnoff et al. 2009 ) was also evaluated using models. Predictive models have been developed to investigate the potential spread of HPAIV H5N1 in the United Kingdom and to develop control strategies that could efficiently mitigate an outbreak (Dent et al. 2008; Sharkey et al. 2008; Truscott et al. 2007 ). A simulation model was used to explore the different pathways of infection from a commercial broiler farm in the United States (Dorea et al. 2010 ).",

In the early stages of infection, infectious agents may not be shed in sufficient quantity to transmit infection to other hosts. Individuals are then said to be in the latent (or exposed) state. Once they are able to transmit the infection, they are classified as infectious and they remain infectious for a period of time. Then, depending on the pathogenicity of the parasite and the immune system of the infected individual, the host either dies or the infection is cleared. Following clearance, the host may become immune to infection for a duration dependent upon the parasite in question.",

Such a model may need to be further developed to incorporate other important characteristics of a particular disease that may have a bearing on disease dynamics. For example, as in the case of HPAIV H5N1 in ducks, an infection may not always lead to clinical symptoms. It may also be the case that expression of disease signs leads to a reduction in host activity, or to its isolation, and thus lowers the contact rate and subsequently the infectiousness.",

This mass-action principle can be modulated depending on selected transmission characteristics, specifically how contact probability varies with changes in population size. The two main approaches are either to define the transmission as density-dependent (pseudo mass-action), where the number of contacts increases with population size, or as frequency-dependent (true mass action), where the number of contacts remains independent of population size.

Therefore, if the values of the components that an intervention acts upon and R 0 are known, the effectiveness of an intervention at reducing these components required to prevent the spread of infection can be obtained.

The successive outbreak waves of HPAI H5N1 occurring in Hong Kong since 1997 (Sims et al. 2003) , and also during the epidemics that have affected South Korea and Japan since 2003, have also been controlled through the depopulation of poultry farms and live bird markets. As it depletes both the number of infected and susceptible individuals, stamping out operates by reducing the infectious period and bird-to-bird contact rates. The usefulness of this strategy for developed countries facing HPAI outbreaks has also been highlighted by mathematical models (Truscott et al. 2007; Le Menach et al. 2006) , and was shown to highly depend on the scale of the disease spread and the early detection of infected flocks. Once disease becomes widespread, the costs of sustaining such a strategy can become prohibitive and may not lead to a sustainable reduction in transmission (Sims 2007) .",

However, reducing R n below one may be neither logistically nor economically possible, particularly for diseases with a high R 0 and/or affecting a fully susceptible host population. In the case that R n is reduced but remains higher than one, the disease may still spread in the population, but the outbreak size, the total number of individuals that experience infection, will be reduced ( Fig. 11 .3).

Three scenarios are shown for a SEIR model with similar initial parameters: No control (blue line), controls but R n remains higher than one (red line); controls with R n lower than one (green line). This figure is adapted from Ferguson et al. (2003) In some cases, interventions may have unintended consequences on the components of R 0 . If the vaccination coverage is suboptimal, or if the vaccine is not fully protective at the individual level, it may create conditions for a silent spread of the infectious agent within a host population. It was shown that insufficient vaccination coverage for HPAIV H5N1 may extend the infectious period of a poultry flock. Indeed, as the vaccination coverage rises, fewer birds become infected but outbreaks become harder to detect (Savill et al. 2006 ). Likewise, Walker et al. (2010) found that the time from infection to reporting was significantly increased in northern Viet Nam following vaccination campaigns. Stamping out may also have unintended effects: failing to implement effective incentive policies leads to underreporting and late detection of outbreaks. In Egypt (Meleigy 2007; ) and Viet Nam, humans are now acting as \"sentinels\" for the disease in poultry (Minh et al. 2009a ).",

Five ways to represent mixing patterns Fig. 11 .4 Probability of disease invasion and distribution of the final epidemic size for R 0 equal to 1.5 and 3. The probability of disease invasion refers to the probability that the introduction of a single infected host into a fully susceptible population leads to a major outbreak.

The density function describes the probability associated with each possible final epidemic size. The initial population size is 100 are shown. Each circle represents an individual. The red circles represent the infectious individuals and the blue circles are the susceptible ones. In randomly mixing populations, each individual has the same probability of making contact with the infectious host. The presence of a particular social structure allows the population to be divided into groups, assuming that the rate of transmission varies within and between these groups. In a metapopulation model, the population is divided into subpopulations that are linked by either contacts, or movements of individuals from one subpopulation to another.

This is generally the case for infectious diseases affecting livestock where animals are usually aggregated into farms, and the movements of animals and fomites between farms can drive the transmission. Models with such a metapopulation structure can replicate patterns of infection that other models cannot.

            "text": "The distribution of factors that determine disease spread, such as the spatial location of farms, contact patterns, production type, and environmental factors, is likely to be heterogeneous. Because of this heterogeneity, the risk for premises to be infected or to transmit the infection follows a distribution that is likely to be highly skewed. Generally, R 0 will be higher when susceptibility and infectiousness are positively correlated (i.e., premises with a high risk of being infected are also at high risk to spread the infection to a high number of other premises) than if the same overall level of infectiousness and susceptibility is evenly distributed within a population (Diekmann et al. 2000) . The role of such heterogeneity was highlighted during the SARS epidemic where \"superspreading\" events were identified as key factor in the spread of infection (Galvani and May 2005) , as some infectious hosts infected a much higher number of individuals than the average infectious case. In the cattle movement network formed by Scottish holdings, it was also estimated that 20% holdings were responsible for 80% of the value of R 0 (Woolhouse et al. 2005) . From a policy development perspective, heterogeneity can have an important impact when assessing the effectiveness of control measures. Indeed, heterogeneity may cause strong stochastic fluctuations in the early stages of an epidemic, and therefore control policies may need to be readily adaptable to changes in the observed rate of transmission. Moreover, interventions targeting potential high-risk premises may lead to effective disease control with less effort than interventions, which do not consider this level of heterogeneity. Finally, integrating information relating to the spatial location of premises and their contact patterns increases the level of realism, and, if this can be accurately parameterized with existing data, is likely to improve the reliability of predictions. However, the number of compartments necessary to monitor the number of individuals in each disease state increases rapidly as they are stratified by each additional risk factor. Therefore, when a relatively complex level of heterogeneity is required, individual-based models, where the infection status of each individual in a population is explicitly modeled, are often preferable.",

Instead, the dynamics of such models have to be simulated in order to obtain numerical approximations of the general model behavior. Although increasing complexity of models improves their realism, it also reduces their transparency, with the mechanisms underlying the disease dynamics becoming increasingly hard to identify, as the number of assumptions and parameters rises. The high number of parameters makes the task of robustly estimating them from data, or finding reliable estimates from existing literature, increasingly arduous. Thus, parameter values or distributions often have to be assumed, subjecting the model outputs to additional and often unquantifiable uncertainty. Moreover, as the desired level of complexity of a model increases, it becomes progressively more difficult to validate any given choice of model assumptions. Therefore, complex models may well become less reliable than simpler ones. In many cases, over-complexity is just as undesirable as over-simplification (Grassly and Fraser 2008) . Models should ideally be as parsimonious as possible, including only mechanisms describing properly the epidemic patterns while ensuring that additional complexity does not alter the outcome. In practice, the level of detail represented in a model needs to be informed by the availability of demographic and disease data. For example in Viet Nam, it has been possible to model the overall dynamics of waves of outbreaks at the commune-level, because this was the geographical resolution at which outbreaks were reported (Walker et al. 2010 ). Moreover, model parameterization should also be complemented by uncertainty and sensitivity analyses. These involve systematically investigating how potential errors in parameter estimation and changes in parameter values are likely to affect the modeled outputs.",

Nevertheless, if absolute predictions are made, they should always be associated with a measure of the uncertainty arising from both the stochastic nature of a transmission process and our limited understanding of processes affecting disease spread.",

Mathematical models can also be used to assess important epidemiological parameters, such as the basic reproduction number and the generation time. Depending upon the scale at which the dynamics of transmission need to be understood, the availability of data and the ability to accurately estimate parameters, models can be developed to incorporate an increasing level of complexity to be able to more faithfully replicate the reallife behavior of epidemics. However, to do so, modelers need to carefully assess the implications this is likely to have for the reliability and transparency of modeled conclusions and predictions. As a result, in many cases, the optimal approach is to develop collections of models that have sequentially increasing complexity. Doing this can provide both general insights into qualitative aspects of disease dynamics and the factors which are most likely to affect transmission, and a robust foundation from which to generate more detailed and realistic predictions.",
