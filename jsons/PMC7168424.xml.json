He is currently President of the Rega Foundation and a director of the Belgian (Flemish) Royal Academy of Medicine, a member of the Academia Europaea and Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He has also been the titular Prof. of the P. De Somer Chair for Microbiology. He has been teaching the courses of Cell Biology, Biochemistry and Microbiology at the K.U.Leuven (and Kortrijk) Medical School, until September 2006 and is still allowed to teach part of the Biochemistry course at the K.U.Leuven Campus Kortrijk. Professor De Clercq received in 1996 the Hoechst Marion Roussel (now called \u201cAventis\u201d) award (American Society for Microbiology), and in 2000 the Maisin Prize for Biomedical Sciences (National Science Foundation, Belgium) for his pioneering efforts in the field of antiviral research. He is an honorary doctor of several Universities [i.e. Ghent (Belgium), Athens (Greece), Ferrara (Italy), Shandong (Jinan, China), Charles University (Prague, Czech Republic) and Budejovice (Czech Republic)]. In 2008 he was elected European Inventor of the Year (Life time achievement award from the European Union). His scientific interests are in the antiviral chemotherapy field, and, in particular, the development of new antiviral agents for various viral infections, including herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella\u2010zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), human papilloma virus (HPV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). He has (co)\u2010discovered a number of antiviral drugs, currently used in the treatment of HSV infections (valaciclovir, Valtrex\u00ae, Zelitrex\u00ae), VZV infections (brivudin, Zostex\u00ae, Brivirac\u00ae, Zerpex\u00ae), CMV infections (cidofovir, Vistide\u00ae), HBV infections (adefovir dipivoxil, Hepsera\u00ae), and HIV infections (AIDS) (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, marketed as Viread\u00ae, and, in combination with emtricitabine, as Truvada\u00ae, and, in combination with both emtricitabine and efavirenz, as Atripla\u00ae).

Binding of oseltamivir, but not zanamivir, to the neuraminidase active site requires a shape change that creates a pocket (Panel A), and mutations that prevent formation of this pocket may prevent binding of oseltamivir but permit binding of zanamivir (Panel B). Crystal structure analysis shows that binding of oseltamivir requires a rotation of the Glu276 residue away from the hydrophobic pentyloxy group of oseltamivir, which then makes hydrophobic contact with a methylene group on Glu276 (Panel C). However, binding of either sialic acid (the natural substrate) or zanamivir does not require a change in the position of Glu276. The His274Tyr substitution in the neuraminidase active site pushes the Glu276 further into the binding site and disrupts the hydrophobic pocket that is required only for oseltamivir binding.
