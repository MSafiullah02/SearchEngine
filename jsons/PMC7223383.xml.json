These landmark UN agreements aim to develop and lead a global process that can create a rare but important opportunity to build coherence across different but overlapping policy areas (Murray et al. 2017). Taken together, these frameworks aim for a more complete agenda for action that spans health, development, humanitarian action, disaster risk management (DRM), and climate change adaptation.",

It is the oldest international emergency and disaster medicine organization and has members from 55 countries and multiple disciplines, such as medicine (including veterinary medicine), nursing, psychology, sociology, emergency management and academia from both governmental and nongovernmental organizations (WADEM 2020). At its 2015 Congress, the WADEM adopted the Cape Town Statement, which explicitly supports the Sendai Framework and its implementation in the health emergency and disaster risk management domain. As a result, the WADEM was one of the organizations that were most rapid in adopting and supporting the implementation of the Sendai Framework and its impacts on health EDRM (Emergency and Disaster Risk Management) evidence, policy, and practice engagement at its various meetings and congresses since 2015.The International Association of National Public Health Institutes (IANPHI), started in 2006, links, supports, and strengthens the institutes responsible for public health in countries worldwide, particularly in low resource settings. Its focus areas include outbreak investigation and control, disease surveillance, health promotion, and emergency response (Pekka and Jeffrey 2017). The IANPHI network agreed to form a new DRM Group at their 2016 Annual Meeting in Shanghai, October 17\u201321, to raise new awareness of global policy and action toward DRM and possible engagement opportunities for national public health institutes. Since then, work has been ongoing to embed DRM approaches into the work of national public health institutes.The International Federation of Environmental Health (IFEH) is an umbrella organization whose members are the national environmental health organizations of countries, as well as universities and associated members. The IFEH represents an estimated 50,000+ professionals and academics from 43 countries working in environmental health, mainly at local, regional, and state governmental levels (IFEH 2019). In May 2017, the IFEH endorsed the principles and agenda behind the Sendai Framework.The International Council of Nurses (ICN) is a global federation of over 130 national nursing associations that endeavors to ensure quality nursing care universally, sound health policies, the development of nursing knowledge, competencies, and skills, and the worldwide presence of a competent, professional, fulfilled, and respected nursing workforce (ICN 2020). The ICN sees the nursing profession as an essential partner in the response and prevention of disasters and considers that it remains an underused resource in the field of DRM. In 2019, the ICN updated their Nurses and Disaster Risk Reduction, Response and Recovery policy statement in line with the Sendai Framework, highlighting that \u201cnurses must be involved in the development and implementation of disaster risk reduction, response and recovery policies at the international level\u201d (ICN 2019, p. 2).",
