BToV mainly causes diarrhea in calves and adult cattle. The virus can not only be detected in feces but also in the respiratory tract, indicating that the virus has dual tissue tropism [6\u20139]. BToV has been detected in 16 countries with a wide geographical distribution [2, 7, 10\u201319]. In addition, a sequence reported to be from goat torovirus is present in the GenBank database, and in 2012, researchers detected the presence of PToV in pig herds by RT-PCR in China [20].",

The BToV genome encodes four structural proteins: spike glycoprotein (S), membrane glycoprotein (M), hemagglutinin esterase (HE), and nucleocapsid glycoprotein (N) [21]. The S protein is involved in viral infectivity and induces the production of neutralizing antibodies [22]. The M protein plays a role in BToV assembly and nucleocapsid recognition [21]. The HE has a putative F-G-D-S motif and has acetylesterase activity specific for N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid [1, 21]. HE contains three functional domains: a lectin domain (R), an esterase domain (E) and a membrane-proximal domain (MP) [23]. The N protein is the only viral RNA-binding polypeptide found in infected cells. It protects the genome and ensures its timely replication and reliable transmission, as well as playing a role in virus transcription and translation [24, 25].",

The results indicate that BToV has circulated in Chinese cows with wide geographical distribution. Although the number of samples was limited, the study confirmed the presence of BToV in China for the first time, which has significant implications for the diagnosis and control of diarrhea in calves in China. Moreover, it is worth noting that many BToV-positive samples were coinfected with other major intestinal viruses (Table 1), which is similar to the previous report from the USA [32].

Strains SC-1 and SC-2 were predicted to be recombinants derived from BToV strains Breda1 and PToV, in agreement with a previous report [8]. Moreover, the two Chinese strains shared identical unique amino acid changes in the S and HE genes when compared to the other strains with sequences available in the GenBank database, indicating the unique evolution in Chinese BToV strains. Interestingly, although these two isolates came from the same farm, their S and HE genes had their own unique amino acid variations. These results will be helpful for understanding the genetic evolution of BToV.",

Another member of the family Coronaviridae, BCoV, has a genomic structure similar to that of BToV, and mutations in the S protein are associated with viral antigenicity, pathogenicity, tissue tropism, and host range change [34, 35]. It has been reported that cleavage most likely occurs between amino acids 1,002 and 1,003 of the mature S protein in BToV, resulting in the formation of the S1 and S2 proteins [24]. The two Chinese strains shared two identical amino acid mutations in the signal peptide that might affect its function. It is worth noting that these two strains have six identical amino acid mutations in the putative S1 region. Since the S1 protein is responsible for receptor recognition and neutralizing antibody induction, mutations at amino acids 60 and 96 (T60I, L96P) might affect virus replication [36]. Therefore, the effects of these unique amino acid variations on the function of the proteins of strains SC-1 and SC-2 S is worth further study.",
