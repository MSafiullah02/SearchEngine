Our model enables a tractable quantitative analysis of the optimal policy for the control of the epidemic dynamics using both lockdown and detection intervention levers. With parametric specification based on literature on COVID-19, we investigate sensitivity of various quantities on optimal strategies, taking into account the subtle tradeoff between the sanitary and the economic cost of the pandemic, together with the limited capacity level of ICU. We identify the optimal lockdown policy as an intervention structured in 4 successive phases: First a quick and strong lockdown intervention to stop the exponential growth of the contagion; second a short transition phase to reduce the prevalence of the virus; third a long period with full ICU capacity and stable virus prevalence; finally a return to normal social interactions with disappearance of the virus. We also provide optimal intervention measures with increasing ICU capacity, as well as optimization over the effort on detection of infectious and immune individuals.",

(2020) ; Magal and Webb (2020) ). More specifically, the COVID-19 turned out to be much more contagious than expected, and official health authorities understood that letting the virus spread freely would probably saturate hospital capacities. In most countries, aggressive quarantine and lockdown measures have been taken, hopefully to stop the spread of the virus and infection, or at least to slow down its diffusion and delay the cases over time to avoid saturation of healthcare systems. The effectiveness of these non-pharmaceutical interventions have been questioned in Hellewell et al. (2020) ; Kucharski et al. (2020) . It was already suggested in Qualls et al. (2017) , but then emphasized by Ferguson et al. (2020) , that these measures should rather aim at 'flattening the curve': mitigation seems more realistic than suppression, since eliminating the threat necessarily takes time, and a massive arrival of people in need in hospitals would be dramatic.",

In order to distinguish between the susceptible, but still unaffected, individuals and the either asymptomatic infected or undetected recovered ones, testing is necessary.

            "text": "In the recent literature on the COVID-19, many papers have focused on the effect of lockdown on the spread of the disease (e.g. Berger et al. (2020) ; Roques et al. (2020) ) or on the evaluation via simulations of exit-strategies (e.g. Domenico et al. (2020) ; Evgeniou et al. (2020) ). In this paper, we suggest a different approach for evaluating lockdown and exit scenarios based on Optimal Control theory (e.g. Pontryagin et al. (1964) ). Although the analysis of public health policies using controls is of clear practical value, there has not been a so dense literature on the subject (e.g. Abakuks (1973 Abakuks ( , 1974 ; Behncke (2000) ; Greenhalg (1988) ; Hansen and Day (2011); Agusto and Adekunle (2014); Sharomi and Malik (2017) ). We consider a modified model, incorporating all the features related to the recent COVID-19 outbreak mentioned above, and use optimization algorithms to compute the 'best' level of lockdown and detection effort in testing individuals. The criterion to rank the different possible strategies takes into account: 1) the death toll of the epidemic, 2) the economic and social costs of the lockdown, 3) the required effort for detecting infected or immune individuals. Besides, we only consider strategies never exceeding the capacity level of the ICU sanitary system. One of the originality of the model considered here is the particular focus on the outcomes of the intensive care units (ICU) saturation, which in many countries have been put under great pressure and whose capacities are determining factors for the death toll of the disease. We assume a capacity constraints on how many individuals can be treated in ICU at a given time. Once the threshold is reached, the fatality rate for the additional patients sent to ICU rises sharply. For the COVID-19 outbreak, we are aware of some works by Alvarez et al. (2020) ; Djidjou-Demasse et al. (2020) ; Piguillem and Shi (2020) , but none of these work models the ICU capacities. In Acemoglu et al. (2020) , no ICU capacity is explicitly introduced, but these authors choose a death rate in hospitals that depends linearly on the number of patients. The non-linearity induced by the threshold that we introduce provides very interesting phenomena and insights for the control of the disease. Furthermore, we investigate cases where the ICU capacity is increasing and evolving dynamically over time. A second feature in our work is that we consider two levers for control: the quarantine ratio and the testing effort for infection and immunity. One of our motivation is to study qualitatively the balance existing between efficient testing and strong confinement strategies. Actually, two testing procedures can be performed here. A short range one, that can detect, at time if someone is infected, or not (Polymerase chain reaction or PCR tests, that can detect whether an individual is infected and send her/him in quarantine). And a long range one, that can detect if someone is immune or not (a blood test as in Huang et al. (2020) ).",

First, a strong and quick lockdown intervention allows to stop the exponential growth of the epidemic spreading and bring the effective reproducing number \u211c under level 1. Then begins a short transition period during which \u211c remains below 1 as the prevalence of the virus within the population diminishes progressively until reaching a threshold * . Since the beginning of the epidemic, the number of individuals requiring ICU is rising and reaches max when the virus prevalence attains * . Then begins a very long period during which the reproducing number \u211c stabilizes at level 1 while the virus prevalence and the ICU occupation remain stable at levels * and max . Finally, when a sufficient proportion of the population has already been infected and the herd immunity level is close enough, a light final release of lockdown measure allows to retrieve a regular level of social interactions and end the epidemic phase. The enhanced pattern of the optimally controlled epidemic dynamics reveal to be very robust to variations of the model parameter within a reasonable range. The effect of the infection detection effort reveals to be more subtle: it allows to reduce significantly the dynamic death toll but can not prevail from the resurgence of a second epidemic wave.",

We will split the group in two: \u2212 the non-tested, or asymptomatic individuals, but contagious, and + the detected part of infected individuals. The second feature is the problem highlighted in the 'flatten the curve' concept (discussed in Ranney et al. (2020) , Kissler et al. (2020) or Gudi et al. (2020) ) which means that a goal in the choice of a public health intervention should be to avoid a surge of demand on the health care system and in particular in ICUs. From a modelling perspective, we introduce the proportions and of individuals using the health care system with or without the need of ICUs. There is an exogenous sustainable limit max for the ICU system, above which the death rate is significantly higher.",

Multiplying this parameter by \u2212 , which is proportional to the number of pairs that we can form with an and an \u2212 individual, provides the total infection rate at the level of the population and at time : \u2212 . Heuristically, this quantity can also be understood as the fraction of the population infected during a unit time interval at time . The infection rate is reduced by a factor (1 \u2212 ) where \u2208 [0, 1] comes from social distancing, quarantine, isolation interventions that reduce infectious contact rates. We consider two ways of testing individuals: short range tests allow to discover new infectious individuals in \u2212 and we denote by 1 the rate at which each of these infectious individuals gets detected, long range test allow to find formerly infected and hereby immune individuals that are now in \u2212 and we denote by 2 the corresponding rate. Here we are interested in the case where the parameters and 1 are control variables and in the sequel, these parameters will be made time dependent. The recovery rate for an infected individual is . The rate at which an infected individual enters the health system is . We assume here that both rates and are the same for detected or non-detected infected individuals. The individual transition rates from to or + , from to + or to are denoted by , , ( ) and ( ) respectively. Notice that the two later rates ( ) and ( ) are not constant but depend on : when the ICU limitation is reached, the extra patients who are not taken in charge by the system can not recover and are exposed to extra death rates, as explained in the Appendix A.

In these papers, some parameters are fixed according to clinical studies and other are estimated from French data.

Quarantine is a rather old technique used to prevent the spread of diseases. It refers to the restriction of movement of anyone (not necessarily sick people), and it usually takes place at home, and may be applied at the individual level. It should be distinguished with isolation, which refers to the restriction of movement of sick people who have a contagious disease. It can be done in hospitals, in dedicated facilities, or at home. Those two are seen as active controls, and are different from contact surveillance, which is passive. Modern quarantine's goal is to reduce transmission by increasing social distance between people, by reducing the number of people with whom everyone can be in contact with. This includes canceling public gatherings, closing public transportation, etc. A lockdown is intended to stop people from moving between places, and it could involve cancelling flights, closing borders, and shutting down restaurants. The idea is to reduce the flow of people to curb transmission, and we might consider here that lockdown and quarantine measures are almost equivalent. Sethi (1978) suggested an optimal quarantine problem, in an model, where a proportion of infected people could be quarantined. He proved that the optimal strategy was either to quarantine all infected individuals (if so, at early stages) or none. In the context of the 2003 SARS pandemic in Singapore, Ooi et al. (2005) recall that a Home Quarantine Order was signed, but it was more an isolation of sick people than a lockdown as the ones used to lower possible consequences of COVID-19. But options considered are different, from one country to another. Wong et al. (2020) mentions that several countries closesd their borders, in most European countries, schools and restaurants were closed for weeks. Lagorio et al. (2011) tried to quantify the effectiveness of a quarantine strategy, where healthy people are advised to avoid contacts with individuals that might carry the disease, using network based models. Here, the parameter has a direct interpretation, since it is related to the average rate of contact between individuals. In Yan and Zou (2008) or Ku et al. (2020) , quarantine and isolation are used as control. In our model, those controls correspond to the component. As in Chinazzi et al. (2020) , such control can also be related to travel bans, for a weaker form than strict quarantine. Note finally that Alvarez et al. (2020) suggested that a complete lockdown was impossible to reach, and that an upper bound of 70% (of the population) should be considered. In this paper, we do not incorporate any constraint (except that we cannot lockdown more than the entire population), but interestingly, in the numerical simulation, the upper bound we obtained as optimal is very close to this value.",

The hyperbolic discount allows for asymmetry in discounting, and non-stationarity, in the sense that postponing in two years now can be substantially different from postponing in three years (from now) next year. On the other hand, van der Pol and Cairns (2002) claims that is not necessarily a realistic assumption, so that using a standard time-consistant exponential discount makes sense in terms of health outcomes. Besides, the longer we can postpone deaths, the more likely a vaccine will be found before. Adding up a exponential discounting factor reveals to be also perfectly consistent with the consideration of random development time of a vaccine solution at large scale, with exponential distribution.

Classically, the production function is a Cobb-Douglas function (as introduced in Cobb and Douglas (1928)) 1\u2212 , with \u2208 (0, 1). Power coefficients are the output elasticities. Here, the function display constant returns to scale, in the sense that doubling the use of capital and labor will also double produced output. Assuming that, on the short term (say less than a year) capital remains constant, it means that if at time , only a proportion of individuals can be economically active, the productivity loss is proportional to 1 \u2212 . Thus, the inter-temporal economic cost at time is proportional to (1 \u2212 ), or (up to an additive constant) \u2212 .

An important motivation was to avoid that hospital systems get overwhelmed, and more specifically, social distancing was introduced to ensure that the fluxes to ICUs with ventilators remain within the capacities of hospitals. Previously, we integrated an upper limit to ICU -denoted by max -and in this section, we discuss the impact of a potential increase of that capacity. Of course, increasing capacity does not simply mean getting more masks, beds, ventilators, or medicines for the serious cases. It also means diverting resources, training more staff to work in the ICU, and probably introduce telemedicine solutions for non-COVID-19 patients (who do not require hospitalization) to free up beds. Figure 5 : Evolution of states with optimal control when 'raising the line' (increase of max by 50%). The plain line is the benchmark scenario discussed in Section 3.2; the dashed line corresponds to a capacity of max which increases linearly from time = 0 until = 60 days up to 1.5 times the initial capacity and then stays at this level.",

We can imagine an increase in the number of more ventilators or back-ups with staff coming from other regions that are spared by the epidemics, as was done in China or France for instance. Another possible interpretation is that the medical staff on the front line might be infected in early periods leading to an initial shortage of personal at the beginning followed by a return to normal within a few weeks. Here, we consider a regular (linear) increase of ICU capacities over two months, until reaching a new limit, 50% higher than the original one. This scenario has a major impact on all quantities.

The final number of dead people is overall smaller than in the original scenario, as the expansion of ICU capacity allows to treat more patients simultaneously. Therefore, the social ancing can be much weaker during the long ICU saturation phase, which also happens to be way shorter. Furthermore, ICU saturation duration is much shorter with a major positive impact on the economy from day 100 until day 400, as the lockdown intervention remains much weaker (after 200 days, the global level of social interactions is around 65% in comparison to less than 50% in our benchmark scenario). This reduces the socio-economic impact of the epidemic and hereby allows to reach a smaller mortality count at time . The overall gain at terminal date is massive (even if here, we do not include a cost for increasing capacities). Nevertheless, the augmentation of ICU capacity implies also a higher daily dynamic death toll, so that an early non-anticipated vaccination solution at an intermediate date would induce a higher sanitary cost in comparison to the scenario without ICU capacity rising.",

We consider a daily detection 1 of 1\u2030 with the dashed line, 1% with the dotted line and 10% with the mixed line. Of course, the more effort we put into detecting infected people, the better the output. For instance we observe a smaller death toll, a weaker economic impact as well as less ICU saturation. Up to remaining numerical errors, moving the detection capacity 1 from 1% to 10% has a strong impact on the overall outcomes of the epidemic: The epidemic size drops from 70% to 30%, the remaining number of susceptible individuals 70% corresponds to the herd immunity obtained with 1 = 0.1 and 0.25, the duration of ICU capacity saturation is divided by a factor larger than 2, and the overall sanitary and economic costs are divided by 2. The huge detection of infected individuals has a strong impact on the socio-economic cost for two reasons: First, detection of infected individuals allows to slow down the epidemic propagation. Second, detected infected individuals are later on identified as immune people, i.e. are in compartment + , so that they are not impacted by social relations limitation, which reduces the overall economic cost. Finally, observe that massive testing has a major impact on most output (and must be massive to really impact, as suggested in Peto (2020) ). Observe that remains rather large, but hopefully, but any epidemic restart is avoided by the detection effort 1 which must not be released (the patterns of some figures close to terminal date are due to the numerical approximation of the infinite horizon problem by a finite one). Figure 11 provides the optimal policy for the detection of infected whenever no lockdown measures are in place, while Figure 12 provides the optimal combination of detection policy and lockdown intervention. For both cases, the weight prevalence has been set up equal to 1. As we can observe on both Figure 11 and Figure 12 , and as stated clearly in Peto (2020) , massive testing and detection strategies could have been used to end the epidemic rapidly. The optimal strategy is here to have extremely massive type-1 detection, to isolate infected individuals. Of course, this will not end the disease, but we can claim that we have here an optimal control on it. Herd immunity is only ensured if we keep the detection active, is still extremely large, and we simply wait for a cure and virus. With that strategy, the peak on ICU is 25% of the upper limit max , is almost null, with no real impact on the economy (there is still an impact since, 20 .

We consider first the case where only the lockdown lever is operated, as was done in France when massive testing was still not an option. Then, in the other scenarios, optimization is done on both lockdown and detection capacity. The notion of 'best scenario' depends of course on the choice of cost function that is made. The optimization takes into account the trade-off between lowering the number of deaths and minimizing the economic and social costs. To our knowledge, taking into consideration these diverse aspects into the cost function has not been done much in the recent literature (see e.g. Acemoglu et al. (2020)).",

This is particularly visible in the scenario where max is increased of 50% at the beginning of the epidemic: we see a relaxation of the lockdown that is permitted by the increased flux allowed in ICUs.",

First, the major drawback of our approach is the necessity to fully observe some underlying latent variables and parameters of the epidemic dynamics, such as the prevalence of the virus. But we observed that the shape of the optimal control is quite robust to a variation of the initial prevalence \u2212 0 , and more generally to variations upon lots of parameters in the model. An important issue about that COVID-19 pandemic was the poor quality of data in the beginning, especially when trying to compare among countries to get robust estimators of various quantities regarding the disease. In our model, we tuned parameters using values from existing literature, and most of the results we obtained were actually extremely robust to moderate changes of those values.",

Such analysis calls for the use of differential quarantine strategies based on an estimation of the own risk of each individual. In our approach we use anti body testing procedure for such purpose, but less accurate estimates of the risk of each individuals are also available depending on their current and past health characteristics. As discussed in Evgeniou et al. (2020) , the key ingredient for considering and using a differential lockdown strategy is a proper handling of the risk of bad specification of the group associated to some individuals. A dynamic optimisation over both the dynamic lockdown intervention together with the risk level associated to each misspecification is left for further research. Similarly the risk of wrong identification of infected or immune individuals using parameters 1 and 2 should be also taken into account in the design of a proper and efficient detection strategy. Also, in view of more practical applications for health policy guidance, a vector based version of +/\u2212 should probably be derived, as in Acemoglu et al. (2020) for instance. Categories can be splited depending on the age of individuals. Hence, will then be ( c , a , s ), with children, adults and seniors, for instance. Most of the equations of the dynamics become multivariate, and parameters will be vectors, except that becomes a WAIFW (or Who Acquires Infection From Whom) matrix, as in Wallinga et al. (2006) or Mossong et al. (2008) . The main interest would be to have target and age-specific controls, with testing and lockdown that can be per age group. The difficult component in this multivariate extension is on the objective function, where the economic component should probably be more related to well-being cost of being quarantined, especially for people who do not belong to labor groups. This paves the way for further researches.",

Because of the exponential increase, a crude estimate would be below 1% two weeks before. The number of reported cases in France on March 15 was around 5,000. According to Sachdeva and Sheth (2020) , when Italy had 5,000 reported cases, an estimation of 60,000 cases was suggested, which would imply a \u2212 0 close to 1\u2030.

With respect to the random time of vaccination , such approximation corresponds to optimizing over the time intervalSimilarly, the problem (12) is an optimal control problem with sate constraint on the ICU capacity, and we choose to replace for ease of numerical tractability the state constraint by a penalization cost with a sufficiently large weight ICU > 0.
