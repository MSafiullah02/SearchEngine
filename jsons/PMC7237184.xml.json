Whilst COVID-19 causes minimal or mild illness in most, a small but appreciable proportion of individuals require oxygen therapy and often admission to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The ensuing unprecedented pressure on hospital wards and ICUs has necessitated rapid redeployment of staff and capacity towards the management of COVID-19 cases with deprioritisation of non-emergency clinical services, including diagnostics and elective specialist surgery. Concurrently, lockdown of the population has impacted dramatically on presentation and referral of symptomatic patients from primary into secondary care[1].",

As well as cancer stage at diagnosis for each cancer type, breast tumour receptor data allowed subtyping of these cancers as ER+ HER2-, HER+ (any), ER- HER2-, and other. Estimates for nosocomial infection rates, median duration of hospital stay for each cancer type, staffing of theatres, ICU and surgical wards were based on information from three large UK surgical oncology centres. Patterns of administration of adjuvant systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT) were based on oncologist-reviewed standard practice guidance[6]. ICU COVID-19 mortality, distribution by age, and duration of stay and proportion referred into ICU were obtained from ICNARC and data from hospitalised UK cases[7, 8]. Due to lack of UK data, data from Wuhan was used as the basis for the age distribution of community infection, age-specific likelihoods of admission from community to hospital, and mortality rates for non-ICU COVID-19 patients [9, 10] (Supplementary Table 1).",

We had sufficient data to generate Fatality HRs for three tumour types and assigned these to other tumours, based on comparability of 5-year survival as low (>90%) moderate (50-90%) or high (<50%) progressiveness tumours[5]. Because we were unable to identify any suitable observational data for tumours of high progressiveness (e.g. oesophageal, gastric), we applied the Fatality HR from tumours of moderate progressiveness; this is likely to be a conservative assumption (Supplementary Table 2).",

Evaluation is also important for the alternative management approaches being adopted, such as radiotherapy with curative intent where surgery is gold-standard or a priori hormonal treatment for prostate and ER-positive breast cancers. For any strategies involving deliberate delay to surgery, models for re-staging and dynamic re-prioritisation are essential. We have focused on the impact to surgery with curative intent; analyses are also required to quantify the impact on mortality of changes to life-extending chemo- and radio-therapy for patients with Stage 4 disease.",

Delay in diagnosis and surgery cause exponential burden of attributable mortality. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented strain on health care provision. It is highly plausible that surges of population infection, lock-downs, resource competition, bottlenecks, and back-logs could recur over the next two years. Supra-normal capacity is required to manage backlogs of accumulated cancer cases alongside ongoing incident cases. To avoid a deferred public health crisis of unnecessary cancer deaths, urgent ringfencing of substantial resources is required. Table 4\n",
