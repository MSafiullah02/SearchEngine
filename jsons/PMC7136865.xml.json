The most widely adopted vaccination is for seasonal flu, however more than 30% of oncologists suggests also performing pneumococcal vaccination in those patients.

Alternative ways to get in touch with patients have been widely used: most patients underwent telephonic interviews with interpretation of laboratory and radiologic exams report, while in other cases family doctors were delegated to inspect the results of follow up exams. Access to oncologic structures was likewise limited and/or denied for visitors and caregivers, either for outpatient visits, day hospital and ward admissions.",

As so, more than 50% of oncologic structures did not have to modify the measures they implemented to reduce the risk of infections, in view of the actual legislation. Due to such measures, more than 20% of structures had reported a significant reduction in their routine activity, while 60% had only a negligible reduction and 9% had not substantially changed their activity.",

Twenty-four percent of Italian oncology departments had at least one patient diagnosed with COVID-19, with a higher rate in the Red Zone (46%) and no diagnosis at all in the South of Italy and in islands. Examining reports from the Red Zone, it emerges that most patients accessed Emergency Room presenting with fever and/or respiratory symptoms (23%), while a significant proportion of patients was diagnosed after a triage procedure (18%) and/or a medical interview regarding possible contacts with subjects at risk (18%).",

Answers to an open question asking whether other useful measures were applied (i.e. other than those indicated by decrees), raised the following issues: re-distribution of patients\u2019 treatment sessions homogeneously throughout the week; reduction of hospital accesses by relying on family doctors for home visits (e.g. medications, patients on treatment with oral metronomic chemotherapy); creation of a dedicated telephone line for emergencies; careful evaluation of risk-to-benefit ratio in heavily pre-treated patients, possibly postponing the start of further lines of palliative therapies. Regarding working activity, multidisciplinary boards have been converted in telematic meetings, and counseling of patients in other hospital wards have been managed by phone, when feasible. In some cases, physicians on duty in COVID wards have been consequently waived from oncologic activities, in order to reduce the risk of infection for both patients and colleagues.",

Some effective points emerge from this survey, which partly have been also raised in the comment recently released by the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) [7]. First, oncologists face the need to preserve the continuum of care for most of their patients, as the benefit of ensuring a well-delivered anti-cancer treatment plan outweighs the risk of COVID-19 infection. However, the risk from COVID-19 exposure varies significantly from patient to patient, making treatment tailoring important now more than ever. Second, physicians have to get used to a new working activity, which implies the use of tele-consultation services when feasible, and reducing the number of visits by means of customizing treatment delivery (three or two-weekly as opposed to weekly, oral or subcutaneous alternatives as opposed to intravenous administration). Also, in view of a visit a telephonic \u201cprevious day\u201d triage could help, in order to avoid the access of symptomatic patients to oncologic wards. Third, protection of patients and physicians is paramount in order to keep providing the best service in a safe way.",
