In some settings farmed animals are also used to supply labour, and the manure of domesticated animals is often used as fertilizer. Animals were probably first farmed, that is their breeding and living conditions controlled by their human owners, around 7000-8000 BC during the first transitions from huntergatherer lifestyles to more settled agricultural living. The physiologies, behaviours, lifecycles of farmed animals generally differ quite substantially from those characteristics of the equivalent wild animals, and this difference impacts the interactions of these farmed animals with their parasites. Farmed animals are exposed to different stresses than wild animals, are kept at different densities, and their lifecycles regulated to such an extent that a parasite-host interaction in a farmed animal may differ significantly from that in a wild animal. Additionally, for infections that are of significant clinical importance, farmers may implement control measures (including treatment or prophylaxis) that alter the infection dynamics. With respect to Cryptosporidium infection, for which a satisfactory chemotherapeutic cure or prophylaxis is not yet available, different species infect different species of farmed animal, and may or may not be of clinical relevance. Table 4 .1 provides an overview of the farmed animals included in this chapter, the species of Cryptosporidium to which they are susceptible and brief notes on the clinical relevance. Greater details are provided in the appropriate chapter sections. Various categories of animals that are 'farmed', including mink, foxes, guinea pigs etc. are not included, largely because of a lack of information on Cryptosporidium in these animals in the domesticated setting.

Both provide meat, milk and other dairy products, and are also used as draught animals, with an estimated 1.5 billion head globally (3 cattle for every 14 people). A comprehensive overview of Cryptosporidium infection in cattle has been published by and the information presented here is largely an update built on this solid basis. Domesticated water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) is also important domestic livestock in the bovinae sub-family. Domesticated buffalo consist of swamp buffalo and river buffalo. In 2011, the world population of buffalo was estimated to approximately 195 million animals, of which 97 % were in Asia (FAOSTAT 2012). The first report on bovine cryptosporidiosis was published in 1971, when parasites were identified in an 8-month-old heifer with chronic diarrhoea (Panciera et al. 1971) . Since then, Cryptosporidium infection in cattle has been documented in most countries worldwide. Four major Cryptosporidium species infect cattle: C. parvum, C. bovis, C. ryanae and C. andersoni (Table 4 .2; Fayer et al. 2007; Feng et al. 2007; Sant\u00edn et al. 2004; Langkjaer et al. 2007) . Cryptosporidium parvum has a broad host range and apparently has the ability to infect most mammals, including humans and cattle. In contrast, the other three species have almost exclusively been found in cattle. In addition to these four common species, sporadic natural infections with C. felis, C. hominis, C. scrofarum, C. serpentis, C. suis and C. suis-like genotype have been detected in cattle (Bornay-Llinares et al. 1999; Geurden et al. 2006; Langkjaer et al. 2007; Sant\u00edn et al. 2004; Smith et al. 2005; Chen and Huang 2012) . The extent to which these findings reflect true infections or accidental carriage, i.e. ingested oocysts that pass intact through the gastrointestinal tract, remains to be clarified. Cattle have also been experimentally infected with C. canis, but natural infection has not been reported ). Many reports on Cryptosporidium in cattle in different countries and settings have been published over the years, showing that Cryptosporidium spp. infections are common worldwide. Both dairy and beef cattle are infected and the prevalence estimates vary considerably among studies. Reported herd level prevalences range from 0 to 100 % (Olson et al. 1997; Chang'a et al. 2011; Maddox-Hyttel et al. 2006; Sant\u00edn et al. 2004 ). Infected animals have been reported from all age groups but infection is most common in preweaned calves. When calves up to 2 months of age have been investigated in point prevalence surveys, 5-93 % of the calves shed oocysts (Table 4.2; Maddox-Hyttel et al. 2006; Sant\u00edn et al. 2004; Uga et al. 2000) . Longitudinal studies performed in infected dairy herds showed that all calves in such herds shed oocysts at some time during their first months of life (O'Handley et al. 1999; .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 947, "end": 969, "text": "(Panciera et al. 1971)", "ref_id": "BIBREF251"}, {"start": 1180, "end": 1198, "text": "Fayer et al. 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 1199, "end": 1216, "text": "Feng et al. 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF110"}, {"start": 1217, "end": 1236, "text": "Sant\u00edn et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF306"}, {"start": 1237, "end": 1259, "text": "Langkjaer et al. 2007)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1663, "end": 1692, "text": "(Bornay-Llinares et al. 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1693, "end": 1713, "text": "Geurden et al. 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}, {"start": 1714, "end": 1736, "text": "Langkjaer et al. 2007;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1737, "end": 1756, "text": "Sant\u00edn et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF306"}, {"start": 1757, "end": 1775, "text": "Smith et al. 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF328"}, {"start": 1776, "end": 1796, "text": "Chen and Huang 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF62"}, {"start": 2427, "end": 2446, "text": "(Olson et al. 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF243"}, {"start": 2447, "end": 2467, "text": "Chang'a et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 2468, "end": 2494, "text": "Maddox-Hyttel et al. 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF197"}, {"start": 2495, "end": 2513, "text": "Sant\u00edn et al. 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF306"}, {"start": 2743, "end": 2754, "text": "(Table 4.2;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2755, "end": 2781, "text": "Maddox-Hyttel et al. 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF197"}, {"start": 2782, "end": 2801, "text": "Sant\u00edn et al. 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF306"}, {"start": 2802, "end": 2818, "text": "Uga et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF364"}, {"start": 2973, "end": 2996, "text": "(O'Handley et al. 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF241"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1167, "end": 1175, "text": "(Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Cryptosporidium Infection in Bovines"}, {"text": "The overall picture is that there is an age-related pattern in the species distribution.

A number of C. parvum GP60 subtype families, designated IIa-IIo, have been described. Of these, IIc and IIe are considered anthroponotic, whereas IIa and IId are commonly found in both humans and animals. The other subtype families are uncommon and their zoonotic potential has not been determined. In cattle, C. parvum of the IIa subtype family is especially common. In addition to IIa, IId and occasionally IIl (sometimes named IIj) subtypes are found (Table 4 .3; Xiao 2010). Whether there is a difference in pathogenicity between subtypes is currently unknown, as most genotyping studies to date have focused on herds with a history of calf diarrhoea. It has been suggested that herd management strategies affect subtype distribution. Studies from areas with closed herd management (limited animal movements between herds) have shown a high number of subtypes in the calf population, but only one subtype in each herd (Brook et al. 2009; Mi\u0161ic and Abe 2007; Soba and Logar 2008; ).

Thus, from clinical and zoonotic perspective, knowledge on the epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis in young calves is highly valuable.

One factor that recurs in several studies is the type of flooring in the calf housing area. In Spain, Castro-Hermida et al.

A protective effect of cement floors was also reported from the USA (Trotz-Williams et al. 2008) . It was suggested that the reason for this protective effect of cement floors is that they facilitate thorough cleaning. This assumption corroborates the finding that a low frequency of cleaning of the calf pens increased the risk for infection (Castro-Hermida et al. 2002) . It is also consistent with the finding that the use of an empty period in the calf pen between introductions of calves was associated with a lower risk for infection in Danish dairy herds (Maddox-Hyttel et al. 2006) .

Cryptosporidium parvum, C. ubiquitum (previously Cryptosporidium cervine/cervid genotype) and C. xiaoi (previously C. bovis-like genotype) are the most common species. Sporadic infection with C. hominis, C. suis, C. andersoni, C. fayeri (previously marsupial genotype I), C. scrofarum (previously pig genotype II), sheep genotype I, and unknown/novel genotypes have been identified (Chalmers et al. 2005; Giles et al. 2009; Karanis et al. 2007; Ryan et al. 2005 Sweeny et al. 2011b; Wang et al. 2010c) . Species distribution differs between studies and between age groups within studies. For instance, C. parvum is commonly found in lambs in Italy, Romania, Spain and the UK (D\u00edaz et al. 2010a; Imre et al. 2013; Mueller-Doblies et al. 2008; Paoletti et al. 2009 ). In other studies, C. ubiquitum or C. xiaoi is the most common species (Fiuza et al. 2011a; Geurden et al. 2008; Robertson et al. 2010; Sweeny et al. 2011b) . For example, Wang et al. (2010c) identified C. ubiquitum in 90 % of all analysed samples, and the species dominated in all age groups, whereas Sweeny et al. (2011b) found C. xiaoi to be the most common (Table 4 .5).

Similarly, no GenBank records are available from the study of Ryan et al. (2005) reporting the \"New bovine B genotype\" in sheep. Since C. bovis was first identified as the bovine B genotype, this could actually be the \"C. bovis-like genotype\", i.e. C. xiaoi.

However, the authors did not associate the problems with the infection, since changed management practices decreased clinical symptoms and mortality, although Cryptosporidium infection was still present on the farm. Enteritis was indicated by the presence of intestinal invasive stages and rectal prolapse in one chick examined by Penrith and Burger (1993) . Because diarrhoea was not reported it is unknown whether the prolapse was caused by intense bowel movements or something else. Cryptosporidium infection has also been associated with pancreatic necrosis (Allwright and Wessels 1993) . Quails and partridges Cryptosporidium infection has been shown in both diarrhoea and respiratory disease in quails (Guy et al. 1987; Hoerr et al. 1986; Murakami et al. 2002; Ritter et al. 1986 ).
