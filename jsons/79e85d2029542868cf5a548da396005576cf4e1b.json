It is known that the growth of pandemic spread at its threshold is exponential, but it is not known how to quantify the success of different containment policies. We identify that a successful approach gives an arrested phase regime following the Ostwald growth, where, over the course of time, one phase transforms into another metastable phase with a similar free energy as observed in oxygen interstitial diffusion in quantum complex matter and in crystallization of proteins. We introduce the s factor which provides a quantitative measure of the efficiency and speed of the adopted containment policy, which is very helpful not only to monitor the Covid-19 pandemic spread but also for other countries to choose the best containment policy. The results show that a policy based on joint confinement, targeted tests, and tracking positive cases is the most rapid pandemic containment policy; in fact, we found values of 9, 5, and 31 for the success s factor for China, South Korea, and Italy, respectively, where the lowest s factor indicates the best containment policy.",

Many researchers all around the world are currently engaged in the quantitative determination of the Covid-19 pandemic spread in almost all countries [7, 8] . Open-source data provided by official health agencies are the essential tool for the scientific community to understand the type of diffusion process and determine the mathematical laws of the diffusion of the virus. Fortunately, few countries, e.g., China, South Korea, Italy, Singapore, and others provided verified data and chose the policy of transparency and containment of contagion through isolation of the population and other restrictive measures on the movement of people. Our data analysis of the pandemic growth curves was carried over about 28 days from the onset t0 where the exponential growth rate characterized by the doubling time, called Td , assumes the value Td0 of about two days in the three different countries.",

The evolution of the epidemic spread shows the universality of the complex growth curves, pointing to the occurrence of multiple phases with transitions in a time-evolving process out of equilibrium. The first phase is the \"pre-threshold phase\" (PTP), showing random scattered events. This phase is characterized by a limited number of infected people which could cover very different laps of time in different sites depending on the local space topology, human density, public transport, social habits, and frequency of face-face interactions at short distance. where the transition of the system from the \"below threshold\" regime to the exponential regime characteristic of the pandemic spread which is indicated by a straight line in the semi-log plot in panel (a). At each time ti, we extracted the time-dependent doubling time Tdi by fitting the data over a five-day period centered at the selected time ti as indicated by the red line in panel (a). The efficiency of the containment policy is indicated by the curvature of experimental curves. The curvature of the growth curves changes with time. Panel (b) shows the three growth curves in a semi-log scale in a common time scale using t0 shown in panel (a) for each country as the starting time. The counts of the Italy and China cases are multiplied by 1.5 to overlap all curves in the near-threshold phase (NTP). The growth curve for pandemic spread in Italy is fitted with a stretched exponential. Panel (c) shows the growth curves in China and South Korea which show the arrested Oswald growth in the log-log scale after a time t*, which is typical of the arrested or frustrated growth in a complex potential landscape.",

The data show the growth regime in the second, third and fourth phases. The second phase starts on a day t0 where the growth for t > t0 shows the typical exponential law of the pandemic spread. This behavior is similar in the three countries considered and it is characterized by a doubling time Td0 of about two days (1.5 < Td < 2). If the process remains free, without introducing containment measures, the number of people infected would, therefore, double in less than three days. Under these conditions, about 10 million people would be infected in a three-week period as indicated by the straight lines in Figure 1a . Figure 1b shows the three different curves on the same time scale using t0 of each curve as a zero time for the explosion of the epidemic spread.",

Therefore, it is possible that the time scale 2t = 14 days is a characteristic time scale to suppress the pandemic spreading by targeted test, mobile phone tracking, and geo-localization used in South Korea and China. The Ostwald arrested or frustrated growth phenomenon which we observed in the Ostwald phase is typically observed in diffusion processes in complex systems [9, 10] , as found by our research group in quantum materials [11] [12] [13] . Indeed, this trend is typically observed in non-homogeneous complex systems with \"domain walls\" or \"topological solitons\" that slow down the growth, with a function having a doubling time Td that changes continuously [14] , which shows, that over the course of time, one phase transforms into another metastable phase with a free energy similar to that observed in the processes of crystallization of proteins [15] and metal phosphates [16] .",

The observed increasing value of Td as a function of time in the NTP and OP regimes are shown to follow an empirical exponential law, As can be seen, even if to a different extent, the three approaches were successful, whereby the different impact of the strategies can be immediately recognized. South Korea seems to have been able to reach the goal in a shorter time. This trend was quantified with the s factor, which must be as small as possible in order to reach the goal of zero people infected per day in the shortest possible time.",

We can reasonably hypothesize that the protocol of positive cases tracing in South Korea started quickly. South Korea made over 250,000 tests corresponding to ~0.5% of its population, quickly identifying a large number of asymptomatic infections that were placed in quarantine [7] , and tracking movements of positive cases is clearly correlated with the arrested growth rate. Moreover, only space confinement of the population is not enough; in fact, in the last 10 days since the first experimental report of 15 March [17] , the success factor in Italy shows practically no changes, and in Italy the growth rate is still in the near-threshold phase (NTP) 30 days after the threshold, while the arrested Ostwald regime has not started. This may be due to a lack of mobile phone tracking being activated, although strict space confinement measures were taken.",

Our approach is based on the study of the physical evolution of pandemic spread, which shows the universality of the complex growth curve with multiple phases and transitions vs. time within the framework of out-of-equilibrium processes. In this framework, the results of our data analysis and, in particular, the introduction of the success s factor are not influenced by the large indeterminacy in the number of infected people and the lack of information on asymptomatic cases which indeed may hardly emerge.",

We show that, once data are shifted to the same time origin, as in Figure 1b and 1c, there is a large difference in the time lapse for the onset of the Ostwald arrested phase for different control strategies but when the Ostwald phase starts it can reach its goal in 14 days.",

At the present stage, numerous experts and institutions are in favor of targeted testing and mobile phone tracking of positive cases.

We can freely provide the computer code we developed if requested to help non-profit organizations maintain control over this rapidly evolving epidemic spread.

Tracking positive cases with targeted tests represents the most rapid pandemic control policy; in fact, it can be easily arrested in a short time 2t = 14 days as shown in both China and Korea, or it can be used to keep the epidemic spread under the threshold phase, thereby stopping the explosion of exponential growth as shown in both Singapore and Israel.",

The average period of time to get the s factor in this work was 40, 15, and 30 days for China, Korea, and Italy respectively. The results show that our success s factor probes the speed of the containment measures to reach the epidemic saturation point.
