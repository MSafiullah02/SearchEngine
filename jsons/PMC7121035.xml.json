These non-pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria have been safely consumed by humans for centuries in fermented foods. They thus constitute an attractive alternative to the attenuated pathogens (most popular live vectors actually studied) which could recover their pathogenic potential and are thus not totally safe for use in humans. This chapter reviews the current research and advances in the use of LAB as live delivery vectors of proteins of interest for the development of new safe mucosal vaccines. The use of LAB as DNA vaccine vehicles to deliver DNA directly to antigen-presenting cells of the immune system is also discussed.",

In the last 10 years, there have been several reports of successful immunisation with a variety of mucosal vector vaccines (Holmgren and Czerkinsky, 2005). The choice of this route of immunisation is governed by the efficiency of vaccines at different Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT): lymphoid structures associated with the nasopharynx, tonsils, salivary glands, and upper respiratory tract, termed Nasal-Associated Lymphoid Tissues (NALT), the Bronchoepithelium and Lower respiratory Tract (BALT), Gastrointestinal tract (GIT), and male and female genital tracts (Cesta, 2006; Corr et al., 2008). Each MALT is covered by epithelium containing specialized cells known as follicle-associated epithelium or microfold (M) cells and plays an important role in the maintenance of the mucosal surface barrier and initiation of mucosal immune reactions (Corr et al., 2008). M cells transport soluble and particulate matter across the mucosal epithelium and perform sampling of luminal antigens; they thus constitute potential inductive sites to stimulate immune responses. Furthermore, mucosal immunisation also induces efficient systemic immune responses and presents less collateral side effects than systemic vaccines. Finally, mucosal immunisation is more easily performed without the need of needles and syringes and thus trained personnel (important feature for mass vaccination programs).",

The live bacterial vectors are either based on attenuated pathogens or on non-pathogenic bacteria (Daudel et al., 2007; Wells and Mercenier, 2008) (Table\n29.1). Compared to viruses genomes which are limited in their capacity to encapsulate several foreign DNA, the genomes of live bacterial vectors can harbor many such heterologous genes. Recombinant bacteria can thus produce many different heterologous antigens which may allow the development of multivalent vaccines.\n",

Attenuated pathogen bacteria such as derivatives of Mycobacterium, Salmonella and Bordetella spp. are particularly well adapted to interact with mucosal surfaces that most of them use to initiate the infection process. Unfortunately, these organisms could recover their pathogenic potential and are not totally safe for use in humans, especially in children and immunosuppressed patients (Alexandersen, 1996). Gram-positive food-grade or commensal bacteria (belonging to commensal flora of the human MALT) constitute an attractive alternative to attenuated pathogenic bacteria (Wells and Mercenier, 2008). In particular, the food-grade lactic acid bacteria (LAB) such as Lactococcus lactis and certain species of lactobacilli possess a number of properties which make them attractive candidates for the development of mucosal vaccines (Berm\u00fadez-Humar\u00e1n et al., 2004a). Indeed, LAB have been used for centuries in the fermentation and preservation of food and they are considered as safe organisms with a GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) status. Moreover, several antigens and/or cytokines have been successfully expressed in LAB, and mucosal administration of these genetic engineered LAB has been shown to elicit both systemic and mucosal immunity (Table\n29.2).\n",

In this context, several studies have compared the production of different antigens in LAB using these three localisations and evaluated the subsequent immunological effects (reviewed in Berm\u00fadez-Humar\u00e1n et al., 2004a; Wells and Mercenier, 2008). These studies have shown that most of the highest immune responses are obtained with antigens exposed to the surface of LAB.

Lo. lactis is considered as a good candidate for heterologous proteins production because it secretes relatively few proteins (van Asseldonk et al., 1993). In addition, the most commonly used laboratory strain (L. lactis MG1363) is plasmid-free and does not produce extracellular proteases (Gasson, 1983). However, the major advantage of the use of L. lactis as live vector for mucosal delivery of therapeutic proteins resides in its extraordinary safety profile since this bacterium is catalogued as a non-invasive and non-pathogenic organism with a GRAS status. Finally, the capacity of L. lactis to produce antigens has been clearly demonstrated in the last 2 decades (Table\n29.2). These features make L. lactis a potential candidate for the development of new safe mucosal vaccines.",

The first attempt to analyze the potential of L. lactis as mucosal vaccine was performed with killed recombinant lactococci producing a cell wall-attached form of a Streptococcus mutans protective antigen (PAc). Mice immunized orally with this recombinant strain developed PAc-specific serum IgG and mucosal IgA antibodies (Iwaki et al., 1990). These results showed for the first time that L. lactis can be used as a delivery vector to present an antigen to the immune system. However, Wells et al. (1993) reported for the first time the use of live recombinant L. lactis, producing the tetanus fragment C (TTFC), to protect mice via subcutaneous injection against a lethal challenge with tetanus toxin. Later, the same group evaluated the effect of oral or intranasal administration with live recombinant lactococci producing TTFC in mice (Norton et al., 1997; Robinson et al., 1997). Oral immunization in mice resulted in a lower serum IgG and mucosal IgA antibodies response than nasal immunization, whereas the protective efficacy (i.e., challenge with tetanus toxin) was the same.",

The immunogenicity of the resulting recombinant strains has been evaluated in some cases in mouse models with very promising results. Among them, one of the best documented projects is based on the use of recombinant L. lactis producing Human Papillomavirus type-16 (HPV-16) E7 antigen. This viral protein is considered as a major candidate antigen for vaccines against HPV-related cervical cancer, the second cause of cancer death in women. The intracellular production of E7 antigen model led to its rapid degradation in the cytoplasm of L. lactis even when produced in a protease-free strain (Berm\u00fadez-Humar\u00e1n et al., 2002). In contrast, secreted and cell wall-anchored forms are rescued from proteolysis and produced a higher level of E7 in L. lactis (Berm\u00fadez-Humar\u00e1n et al., 2002, 2004b). Antigen-specific humoral (production of E7 antibodies) and cellular (secretion of IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 cytokines) responses were observed after intranasal administrations to mice of recombinant lactococci expressing E7 antigen at different levels and cellular locations. They were significantly higher in mice immunized with L. lactis expressing E7 as a cell wall-anchored form (Berm\u00fadez-Humar\u00e1n et al., 2004b). These first reports of E7 production in a food-grade LAB represent one more step towards the development of a therapy against HPV-related cervical cancer. Indeed, the protective effects of mucosally co-administered live L. lactis strains expressing cell wall-anchored E7 and a secreted form of interleukin-12 to treat HPV-16-induced tumors in a murine model were then evaluated (Berm\u00fadez-Humar\u00e1n et al., 2005). When challenged with lethal levels of tumor cell line TC-1 expressing E7, 50% of pre-treated mice showed full prevention of TC-1-induced tumors. Therapeutic immunization with these recombinant strains, i.e., 7 days after TC-1 injection, induced regression of palpable tumors in 35% of treated mice. These preclinical results suggest the feasibility of mucosal vaccination and/or immunotherapy against HPV-related cervical cancer using genetically engineered lactococci.",

InlA binds to an extracellular domain of E-cadherin, a transmembrane cell-to-cell adhesion molecule (Mengaud et al., 1996). InlA is necessary for invasion of epithelial cells and is sufficient to reconstitute invasion when expressed in non-pathogenic and non-invasive species of Listeria innocua (Mengaud et al., 1996). Moreover, when InlA is expressed in L. lactis, it can promote the internalization of lactococci into the human epithelial line Caco-2 in vitro and into enterocytes in vivo after oral administration to guinea pigs. In addition, L. lactis InlA+ is able to deliver a functional plasmid coding for GFP and about 1% of Caco-2 cells express GFP after co-culture with this strain (Guimar\u00e3es et al., 2005\n).",

High production level of heterologous proteins in L. lactis can be achieved using constitutive promoters. However, continuous high-level production of certain proteins, such as cytokines (our observations) could lead to intracellular accumulation or degradation which could be deleterious to the cell. Thereby, to prevent possible negative effects caused by high production, inducible promoters have been developed. In these systems, gene expression can be controlled by an inductor, a repressor or by environmental factors, such as pH, temperature or ion concentrations (Morello et al., 2008).",

NICE is a system that allows controlled gene expression by addition of nisin, an antimicrobial peptide used as a natural preservative in the food industry. With this versatile system, the level of gene expression can be controlled by the amount of nisin used for the induction and can be up-regulated more than 1,000-fold (Mierau and Kleerebezem, 2005). As L. lactis is a non-colonizing bacterium, therefore, a system that allows preload of the organism with the antigen before in vivo application is highly desirable. Induction with NICE system can be considered as a good strategy to obtain high levels of heterologous antigen production in vitro. In addition, even after an in vitro nisin-pulse, recombinant L. lactis continue to produce heterologous proteins and to evoke an antigen-specific response when administered in mice (Berm\u00fadez-Humar\u00e1n et al., 2003b, 2004b). These observations support the use of NICE system for the expression of heterologous proteins in L. lactis.",

In this context, a family of new vectors which allow heterologous antigens expression in L. lactis either intracellularly, extracellularly or cell wall-attached were designed (Berm\u00fadez-Humar\u00e1n et al., 2003b; Cortes-Perez et al., 2003). These small vectors, based on the broad-host-range pGK plasmid (Kok et al., 1984), are composed of cassettes that allow easy exchange of different expression signals and/or genes. Moreover, as these vectors have the capacity to replicate in Gram-positive bacteria (including Bacillus subtilis, L. lactis and Lactobacillus spp.) and Escherichia coli, the procedure of DNA cloning (sometimes laborious in Gram-positive organisms) can be performed in E. coli. Once the recombinant vector is established in this bacterium, it can be transferred to the desired Gram-positive bacterium. Most importantly, these vectors have been used to produce successfully different heterologous antigens in L. lactis (Table\n29.2). A well illustrated example of the efficiency of our system to produce heterologous antigens is the expression of E7 antigen from human papillomavirus type-16 (HPV-16). Initially, DNA plasmid constructions were performed in E. coli for E7 expression at different levels and cellular locations using the family of vectors described above (i.e., pCYT:E7, pSEC:E7 and pCWA:E7). After confirmation of the sequence of these recombinant vectors, they were transferred successfully to L. lactis and E7 production was evaluated by western blot analysis.",

However, before the approval of this clinical study the development of a containment system for the genetically modified L. lactis was necessary. To address safety concerns with the use of IL-10-secreting L. lactis in humans, the chromosomal thymidylate synthase (thyA) gene was replaced by the gene encoding for IL-10 to generate a thymine auxotroph phenotype. Viability of the thyA hIL-10+ strain was reduced by several orders of magnitude in the absence of thymidine or thymine and containment was validated in vivo in pigs (Steidler et al., 2003). Strikingly, the phase I clinical trial conducted with the thyA hIL10+ strain in patients with Crohn's disease showed that the containment strategy was effective (Braat et al., 2006).
