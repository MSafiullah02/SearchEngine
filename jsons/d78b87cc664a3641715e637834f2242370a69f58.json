Avipoxviruses have been identified as the causative agent of disease in at least 232 species in 23 orders of birds. Vaccines based upon attenuated avipoxvirus strains provide good disease control in production poultry, although with the large and intensive production systems there are suggestions and real risks of emergence of strains against which current vaccines might be ineffective. Sequence analysis of the whole genome has revealed overall genome structure and function resemblance to the Chordopoxvirinae; however, avipoxvirus genomes exhibit large-scale genomic rearrangements with more extensive gene families and novel host range gene in comparison with the other Chordopoxvirinae. Phylogenetic analysis places the avipoxviruses externally to the Chorodopoxvirinae to such an extent that in the future it might be appropriate to consider the Avipoxviruses as a separate subfamily within the Poxviridae. A unique relationship exists between Fowlpox virus (FWPV) and reticuloendothelosis viruses. All FWPV strains carry a remnant long terminal repeat, while field strains carry a near full-length provirus integrated at the same location in the FWPV genome. With the development of techniques to construct poxviruses expressing foreign vaccine antigens, the avipoxviruses have gone from neglected obscurity to important vaccine vectors in the past 20 years. The seminal observation of their utility for delivery of vaccine antigens to non-avian species has driven much of the interest in this group of viruses. In the veterinary area, several recombinant avipoxviruses are commercially licensed vaccines. The most successful have been those expressing glycoprotein antigens of enveloped viruses, e.g. avian influenza, Newcastle diseases and West Nile viruses. Several recombinants have undergone extensive human clinical trials as experimental vaccines against HIV/AIDS and malaria or as treatment regimens in cancer patients.

There are now ten official species accepted with several more tentative species in the genus (Tab. 1) [1] . Species demarcation is poorly defined but criteria include disease characteristics, origin host, growth characteristics in the chorioallantoic membrane of embryonated eggs or avian cell cultures, cross-protection in chickens against classical FWPV and restriction endonuclease analysis of genomic DNA and cross-hybridisation. Given the size and complexity of the avipoxviruses at the genome and virion level, our understanding of the extent and nature of relationships of the official and tentative species is at best rudimentary. Nucleotide sequence determination of selected conserved genes might provide a means of presumptive classification, and has been attempted using the 4b gene [18, 19] . However, relationships defined on this basis will fail to take into account variations in gene content arising from gene loss and gain during evolution [20, 21] . Avipoxviruses may well be the largest and most diverse genus in the Chordopoxvirinae [6] . Although the origin of birds is controversial they have probably been around in some form for at least 150 million years. The avipoxviruses have almost certainly co-evolved with their hosts and in the process acquired genes from the host that have assisted the virus to counter the host cellular and immune responses [20, 21] .

There are no suitable or specific treatments available once infection is established. Transmission by biting insects, particularly mosquitoes, can be linked to seasonal and geographic incidence of disease, so appropriate screening and insect control programs for commercial poultry production can reduce the impacts of disease. Infection via cutaneous injuries or inhalation can be reduced by control of crowding and decontamination of premises following outbreaks. FWPV can survive in dried scabs for extended periods (weeks if not months), so attention to sanitation of housing, feed and water is essential for effective disease prevention. FWP is distributed worldwide in domestic poultry with the incidence variable in different geographic regions -related to management and hygiene practices, mosquito control and the use of prophylactic vaccination. Prophylactic vaccination for the control of FWP in commercial poultry has been practiced for a considerable period of time [22] . The early history of vaccines for FWP, pigeonpox (PGP), turkeypox (TKP) and CNP was well documented by Beaudette in 1949 [22] ; this reference provides fascinating insights into early attempts to vaccinate against avipox and to understand the relationships amongst the avipoxviruses. Since the late 1960s and early 1970s, modern commercial vaccines have been available in most regions of the world for the control of FWP. Other vaccines, e.g. against TKP, quailpox (QUP), CNP and PGP, are available in specific regions [23] . The virus strains used in the vaccines have been derived empirically by the passage of field isolates in embryonated eggs or chicken embryo-derived cell cultures. Selected on the basis of immunogenicity (protection against challenge) and attenuation (reduced pathogenicity) in comparison with the original field strain and on the basis of freedom from other avian pathogens, the vaccines have found widespread use for the control of avipox disease.

Twelve of the 46 open reading frames affected by the apparent passage-specific mutations encoded members of the ankyrin repeat family. The mechanisms by which such mutations lead to attenuation are as yet unclear [3] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1307, "end": 1310, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Whole genome sequences"}, {"text": "Restriction endonuclease enzyme profiles of avipoxvirus genomes show significant variation in genome arrangements, suggesting the potential for marked differences in genome content [37, 40, 41] . Limited gene sequence data from CNPV Tokyo CG-2 strain indicated that, while CNPV and FWPV appeared to share regions of similar gene order, there are marked differences at the deduced amino acid level. Gene homologies between CNPV and FWPV ranged from 55% to 74%, a divergence that is comparable to that seen between the different Chordopoxvirinae genera [44] . The substantial differences between CNPV and FWPV were confirmed by full sequencing of the CNPV genome [4]. The CNPV is markedly larger than FWPV, with 365 kbp versus 266-288 kbp. Central regions of the CNPV genome contain homologues of the Chordopoxvirinae genes involved in the basic replicative mechanisms such as viral transcription, RNA modification, viral DNA replication, structure and assembly of virions. It has been shown that there are 106 conserved Chordopoxvirinae genes shared between CNPV and FWPV with an average of 70% amino acid identity. CNPV genome encodes 39 genes, the homologues for which are absent from the FWPV genome or fragmented, while CNPV lacks 15 genes present in the terminal genome regions of FWPV. Internal genome regions exhibit considerable variability between CNPV and FWPV in contrast with the relative overall conservation of central regions of genomes in other Chordopoxvirinae. Major genome variability is located near the junctions of genome rearrangements relative to the other Chordopoxvirinae. These regions contain genes that appear to be involved in virus-host interactions. The CNPV Wheatley C93 strain has a close relationship at the nucleotide (98%) and amino acid (91% to 100%) level to the CNPV Tokyo CG-2 strain in those regions for which there is comparable sequence available [4, 44] . This provides a level of confirmation of genome conservation for different isolates causing CNP and supports the designation of CNPV at the species level in the Avipoxvirus genus. Tulman et al. [4] concluded that \"the genomic data and phylogenic analysis of individual open reading frames support a monophyletic origin of the two avipoxviruses relative to the other Chordopoxvirinae.\" The divergence between FWPV and CNPV appears to be as great as that between other Chordopoxviridae genera. The apparent divergence established by restriction endonuclease analysis of avipoxvirus genomes [37, [39] [40] [41] [42] and nucleotide sequence of the 4b gene [18, 19] supports this conclusion, and suggests that there is potentially substantial and far ranging genomic diversity amongst the viruses that have been reported as causing disease in at least 232 species in 23 orders of birds.

Notwithstanding the conservation of overall genome composition and structure, including a central core of genes, inverted terminal repeats and a large numbers of functionally important orthologs, the FWPV and CNPV genomes exhibit large-scale genomic rearrangements with more extensive gene families and novel host range genes in comparison with the other Chordopoxvirinae [2, 3]. Gene loss and gain appears to be the dominant mechanism in the evolution of Chordopoxvirinae genomes. Many genes have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer from the host.

Other FWPV vaccine strains known not to cause REV infection carry either a complete or partial LTR [7, 45-49]. The presence of full or partial LTRs in FWPV vaccine strains can be explained by the presence of tandem repeated LTRs of the provirus. Such structures are inherently unstable in poxvirus genomes with the intervening sequences rapidly lost by inter-or intramolecular recombination [50, 51] . Instability of tandem repeated sequences in poxviruses is exploited to construct recombinants using transient dominant selection methods [52, 53] . Since the 5' and 3' LTRs of the integrated provirus are different, the presence or absence of a full or partial LTR upon loss of the REV provirus would be dependent upon the cross-over site during the recombination event in the LTR leading to the provirus loss [45, 48] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 72, "end": 75, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 751, "end": 755, "text": "[50,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 756, "end": 759, "text": "51]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 899, "end": 903, "text": "[52,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 904, "end": 907, "text": "53]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1171, "end": 1175, "text": "[45,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1176, "end": 1179, "text": "48]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "FWPV and REV"}, {"text": "A number of features of the REV integration into the FWPV genome suggest an ancient and unique event [46] .

Given the complexity of the FWPV genome and the undoubted role of multiple gene products in determination of virulence and pathogenicity, the re-integration of REV alone is unlikely to be sufficient to restore full virulence to FWPV vaccine strains -many of which have undergone multiple passages in culture to generate attenuation with consequent gene loss, rearrangement and disruption [3]. There is no evidence for this occurring and it is important to remember the biology of FWPV and REV. Retrovirus integration takes place in the nucleus of infected cells by a well-defined pathway. FWPV DNA replication takes place in the cytoplasm of the infected cell and is unlikely to be a readily accessible target for REV integration. Given the physical and functional separation of REV and FWPV infection cycles in cells, integration is an unlikely rare event following co-infection of cells with FWPV and REV. Attempts to generate re-integration or recombination between the vaccine strain FPV-M3 and REV by co-infection and passage in CEF cells have been unsuccessful (Boyle, unpublished) . It is difficult, however, to construct selection regimens that might allow rare events to be detected. In contrast, co-infection in cell culture with MDV and REV or avian leukosis virus (ALV) leads to rapid and numerous integration events in the MDV genome -a reflection that MDV replicates in the nucleus of the infected cell where it can be a ready target for REV or ALV integration [54] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1331, "end": 1351, "text": "(Boyle, unpublished)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1739, "end": 1743, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "FWPV and REV"}, {"text": "The presence of REV provirus or LTR in other avipoxviruses has been explored to some extent.

Our observations (unpublished) on 25 avipoxviruses isolated from native avifauna of Australia and New Zealand have shown that REV is absent from these isolates.

At the time there was a paucity of knowledge regarding the molecular biology of the avipoxviruses, consequently it was not obvious that the techniques developed for vaccinia virus recombinants would be directly applicable to the construction of avipox recombinants.

The novel finding that rFWPV and rCNPV could enter non-avian cell types, undergo an abortive (non-productive) replication cycle, express the foreign encoded vaccine antigen and thus induce immune responses in mammals led to an expanded interest in the avipoxviruses as vaccine vectors [10, [60] [61] [62] . It is generally accepted that avipoxviruses can cause productive infection and thus disease only in avian species. Early studies indicated that upon intranasal inoculation of mice there was an absence of replication and limited pathology [63] and that in cell cultures cytopathology occurs without replication [64] .

Additionally, it is prudent to consider the removal of early poxvirus transcription terminator (T5NT) sequences from the gene(s) to be expressed, as their presence may abort or significantly attenuate early gene expression in cells. Impacts upon the induction of cell-mediated responses may also occur as it has been demonstrated in vaccinia virus that late gene expression may not induce cell-mediated immune responses [72] ; this impact has not formally been shown for avipoxvirus recombinants to my knowledge. It might be argued that late gene expression in FWPV is less likely to affect cell-mediated immune responses since FWPV does not shut down host cell protein synthesis to the extent that vaccinia virus does [73] . Antigen processing into MHC class I antigen-presenting pathways has been shown to be the mechanism by which vaccinia virus inhibits cell-mediated immune response induction from late expressed gene products [74] . If avipoxvirus recombinants are intended for animal or human clinical trials, then it is essential to use a cell substrate acceptable for this purpose. Consequently, growth and plaquing must be undertaken in chicken embryo cell cultures derived from certified sources of specific pathogen-free embryonated eggs.

A rational choice of promoter for optimal gene expression in recombinant avipoxviruses is not entirely clear as only a few studies have attempted to compare promoters for levels of expression [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] and promoter optimisation by sequence modification has been undertaken only in vaccinia virus.

Co-expression of the Escherichia coli xanthine guanine ribosyl transferase gene conferring resistance to mycophenolic acid is a convenient selection marker for amplification of recombinants [58] . Additionally, co-expression of the Lac Z gene allows convenient identification and plaque purification of recombinants on the basis of blue staining of plaques with suitable -galactosidase enzyme substrate [53, 58] .

The use of transient dominant selection for insertion of vaccine or therapeutic genes into avipoxvirus recombinants should be considered, as the selection and marker genes are not retained in the final recombinant and the selection and marker genes can be reused to make additional insertions at different loci [53] . This allows the construction of complex recombinants carrying multiple antigen genes and immune modulators.

Since productive avipoxvirus infections are restricted to avian cells, FWPV non-genetic reactivation of poxviruses in avian or non-avian cells provides a facile mechanism for recovery of infectious poxvirus from naked DNA -the contaminating FWPV is simply removed by passage on non-avian cells [96] . Recovery of FWPV from DNA has not been demonstrated to date; however, it should be possible by the use of a poxvirus whose replication is non-permissive in avian cells or whose infectivity has been suitably inactivated.

The restriction of antibody responses to the HA following vaccination and the induction of high titres of antibodies to both HA and NP following infection can be used to discriminate vaccinated birds or flocks from those in which avian influenza (HPAI or LPAI) may have circulated since the latter flocks will have antibodies to both HA and NP -so-called DIVA tests (dif-ferentiation of infected from vaccinated animals).

This can include the direct intra-tumour injection of rFWPV or rCNPV expressing tumour antigens and immunostimulators in attempts to break self tolerance.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 191, "end": 196, "text": "[167]", "ref_id": "BIBREF131"}, {"start": 197, "end": 202, "text": "[168]", "ref_id": "BIBREF132"}, {"start": 203, "end": 208, "text": "[169]", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}, {"start": 209, "end": 214, "text": "[170]", "ref_id": "BIBREF134"}, {"start": 215, "end": 220, "text": "[171]", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Preclinical and clinical human vaccine trials"}, {"text": "The avipoxviruses have gone from neglected obscurity to important vaccine vectors in the past 20 years. The seminal observation of their utility for delivery of vaccine antigens to non-avian species has driven much of the interest in this group of viruses to the extent that rFWPV and rCNPV have undergone extensive clinical trials in humans for vaccines against HIV/AIDS and in treatment regimens for cancer patients. Their application as vaccine vectors in avian and non-avian species has been most successful where glycoprotein antigens of enveloped viruses have been expressed. Interest in the human area has been driven by their safety profile, generation of enhanced and directed responses in prime-boost vaccination regimens and the ability to co-express immunostimulatory/modulatory molecules. Exploration of the basic molecular virology of the avipoxviruses has thrown light on the evolutionary pathways of the Poxviridae and in the future it may be necessary to consider the Avipoxvirus genus as a separate subfamily within the Poxviridae but outside the Chordopoxvirinae. The intriguing and unique relationship that exists between FWPV and REV is one of those fascinating stories that have emerged from our studies of this group of viruses.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "General conclusions"}, {"text": "To provide consistency and accuracy this manuscript has adopted the nomenclature and abbreviations used by the ICTV: 7th Report [1].
