Pathological similarities included bilateral atrial enlargement, pericardial effusion and myocardial degeneration. However, there were some differences. In the previously reported rabbit severe cardiomegaly was present but pleural effusion and renal lesions were absent. In this current report, the aetiology of the heart disease remained undetermined in both rabbits. In case 1, the gross and microscopic features and lack of significant vascular disease correlated best with a primary cardiomyopathy, most likely hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). This was supported by the increased ventricular wall thickness bilaterally, the bi-atrial dilation, myocardial fibrosis and absence of ventricular dilation. In case 2, the gross cardiac findings were more suggestive of dilated cardiomyopathy. The echocardiographic findings in both cases indicated both asymmetric concentric hypertrophy, atrial dilation and, in case 1, poor systolic function, suggesting an unclassified cardiomyopathy. As well as cardiomyopathy, the two rabbits had chronic nephropathy in common, although case 2 was diagnosed based on gross post-mortem examination alone.
