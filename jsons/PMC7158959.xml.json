Severe infections in human beings were characterised by rapidly progressive pneumonia acquired in the community, multiorgan dysfunction, and cytokine dysregulation.11, 12, 13, 14, 15 The initial cases of infections in human beings were clustered around the lower Yangtze River delta, including Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. Subsequently, cases were identified in other areas of China, including Beijing, Henan, Shandong, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Fujian, which are located along an avian migratory pathway (figure 1\n).18 On April 24, 2013, the first case outside the mainland was confirmed in a 53-year-old Taiwanese businessman who regularly travelled between Jiangsu and Taiwan.13 We compare the geographical and social characteristics between Hong Kong and Shanghai, the likely origin and virological features of the 1997 influenza A H5N1 virus and the 2013 influenza A H7N9 virus, and clinical manifestations caused by these two viruses.",

On the basis of antigenic and genetic differences between the internal proteins, nucleoprotein and matrix protein, influenza viruses are classified into A, B, and C. The influenza A virus has a negative-sense, single-stranded, and eight-segmented genome. On the basis of two surface proteins, 17 haemagglutinin subtypes and ten neuraminidase subtypes can be found (figure 2\n).19 Except H17 and N10, which have been found in bats only, all haemagglutinin and neuraminidase subtypes have been found in wild waterfowl.20 Unlike other neuraminidase subtypes, N10 does not have neuraminidase activity.21 The 17 haemagglutinin subtypes are further classified into group 1 and group 2 on the basis of the antigenic and phylogenetic characteristics of haemagglutinin. The HA1 subunit of the haemagglutinin attaches onto host cell sialic acid receptor. The haemagglutinin precursor protein HA0 is cleaved by proteases into HA1 and HA2 before HA2 can mediate virion\u2013cell fusion. The internal proteins are encoded by six other gene segments encoding nucleoprotein NP, matrix protein M1, ion channel protein M2, the polymerase complex proteins PB1, PB2, PA, including PB1-F2, PA-X, PA-N155, PA-N182, and non-structural proteins including PB1-F2, PA-X, PA-N155, PA-N182, NS1, and NS2.19, 22\n",

Phylogenetic analysis shows that the 1997 H5N1 virus infecting human beings was a reassortant with goose H5N1 haemagglutinin, teal H6N1 neuraminidase, and internal genes from quail H9N2 and teal H6N1.23, 24 The 2003 H7N7 virus that infected human beings in the Netherlands was a reassortant between avian influenza A H7N3, influenza A H10N7, and other Eurasian avian influenza viruses (figure 3\n).9 On the basis of available sequences in the public domain, the 2013 H7N9 virus is also a reassortant of avian influenza viruses consisting of haemagglutinin and neuraminidase most closely related to H7N3 viruses isolated from ducks in Zhejiang and H7N9 viruses from wild birds in Korea, respectively. The M, NP, and NS genes are most closely related to H9N2 viruses from chickens in eastern China, whereas the PA, PB1, and PB2 genes are most closely related to those of H9N2 viruses from brambling in Beijing.11, 12, 13, 25, 26 Because the origin of all gene segments of the 2013 H7N9 virus are avian, gene reassortment probably took place in an avian host. Although reassortment events of avian influenza viruses have been recorded in pigs in Korea,27 the 2013 H7N9 virus and the immediate precursors have not been found in pigs.28\n",

Because of the roughly 5% nucleotide differences in the H7 and N9 genes between the 2013 H7N9 virus and the closest avian virus genes, more extensive virological surveillance of wild or domestic avian and non-avian animal species, as has been done for the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,30 is needed to understand the evolutionary pathway of this H7N9 virus, which is the first N9 subtype virus infecting human beings. Up to now, only one wild pigeon from Nanjing has tested positive for the 2013 H7N9 virus,31 but the epidemiological and genomic details of this virus isolate are not yet available.",

            "text": "One unique feature of the 2013 H7N9 human epidemic is the absence of preceding die-offs in poultry or wild birds, which makes epidemiological control difficult. The start of the H5N1 outbreak in 1997 was marked by three highly pathogenic avian influenza virus outbreaks on farms 1 month before the first human case and about 8 months before the next 17 human cases.32 Avian influenza virus can be divided into highly pathogenic avian influenza virus and low pathogenic avian influenza virus on the basis of pathogenicity in chickens. The World Organization for Animal Health has defined highly pathogenic avian influenza virus as any influenza virus that is lethal for six or more of eight 4\u20138-week-old susceptible chickens by 10 days after intravenous inoculation with 0\u00b72 mL of a 1/10 dilution of a bacteria-free infective allantoic fluid, or that has an intravenous pathogenicity index of greater than 1\u00b72, which is calculated by scores on the severity of illness.33 One key feature of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus is the presence of multibasic aminoacids at the haemagglutinin cleavage site, which render haemagglutinin susceptible to cleavage by many different proteases.34 Hence, H5 or H7 viruses that have low pathogenicity in chickens are still regarded as highly pathogenic avian influenza virus if their HA0 cleavage sequence is similar to that of other highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. The haemagglutinin cleavage site from all reported 2013 H7N9 viruses do not possess multibasic aminoacids.11, 12, 35 Data from preliminary pathogenicity testing suggest that chickens and quails infected with H7N9 do not show signs of illness.36 A low pathogenic avian influenza virus can mutate to become highly pathogenic during an outbreak in domestic poultry. For the H7N3 virus outbreaks in 2002 and 2004, the difference in the cleavage site between low pathogenic avian influenza virus and highly pathogenic avian influenza virus was speculated to be a sequence insertion from the neuraminidase or M gene at the haemagglutinin cleavage site through intersegmental recombination.37 Close monitoring of the evolution of the 2013 H7N9 is needed.",

This process might be sufficient to militate against poultry death, but not asymptomatic viral shedding.39 The effect of previous infection by other avian influenza virus subtypes and previous H5N1 vaccine on the susceptibility to infection by H7N9 deserves further investigation.",

            "text": "Interspecies jumping of an avian influenza virus into human beings is favoured by several factors: viral mutations that allow the virus to bind, replicate, and spread in human beings; a high inoculum of virus during the transmission between the poultry and human being; host susceptibility such as the presence of underlying diseases; extremes of age; and genetic predispositions. One key viral factor governing host adaptation and transmission is the relative binding affinity between haemagglutinin and the sialic acid receptor on the host cell surface.40 Avian influenza viruses generally prefer \u03b1-2,3 sialic acid receptors abundantly found in avian alimentary tract and human influenza viruses generally prefer \u03b1-2,6 sialic acid receptors abundantly found in the human respiratory tract. H5N1 viruses can invade the lower respiratory tract of human beings because the viruses retain strong affinity for the \u03b1-2,3-linked receptors present in the lower respiratory tract of human beings.41 An increased affinity for the \u03b1-2,6-linked receptors, which are abundant in the upper respiratory tract of human beings, is believed to be responsible for transmission between birds and human beings. In Egypt, which has had the highest number of H5N1 infections since 2009, 99% of virus isolates had a Thr160Ala (H3 numbering) mutation, which is associated with loss of glycosylation at position 158\u2013160, and increased transmissibility in ferrets and guinea pigs.42, 43 Thr160Ala was also present in all reported strains of 2013 H7N9 (table 2\n). The haemagglutinin mutations Gly186Val and Gln226Leu, which increase the binding of H5N1 and H7 viruses to \u03b1-2,6-linked receptor and H5N1 virus transmission between ferrets, are present in most strains of the human and avian 2013 H7N9, but none of the 1997 H5N1 strains (table 2).11, 12, 35, 45, 46, 47 However, a recent structural modelling and binding study with human tracheal epithelium and alveolar tissue sections suggested that 2013 H7N9 has weak binding to both \u03b1-2,3-linked and \u03b1-2,6-linked receptors.48 Further studies should confirm whether various strains of H7N9 differ in binding affinities.",

By contrast, in the 1997 H5N1 outbreak in Hong Kong, 61% of patients were younger than 18 years of age1, 74 and the mean age of patients with H5N1 in China between 2003 and 2008 was 28\u00b71 years (table 4\n).78 The severe disease in older adults and the small number of cases in children in the 2013 H7N9 outbreak can be accounted for by several factors. First, H7N9 infection in children was mainly mild or asymptomatic (appendix);14, 79, 80 therefore, infection in this age group might have been underdiagnosed because confirmatory laboratory tests were usually reserved for severe cases. Two children were found to be infected with H7N9 during an enhanced surveillance that included 6333 children younger than 4 years of age with influenza-like illness.79 Second, some adult patients were poultry workers; generally only adults go to live poultry markets and therefore adults might have had a greater dose or prolonged duration of exposure to H7N9 than did children. Additionally, adults might have an increased chance of exposure to pet birds. Finally, older adults might have impaired development of specific immune response to the H7N9 virus because of the immunological phenomenon of original antigenic sin.81, 82 Previous exposure to other influenza viruses might also lead to rapid increase in non-neutralising antibodies against these viruses, which can be associated with more severe H7N9 disease.83, 84 Notably, most fatal or severe cases of 2013 H7N9 have comorbidities, and up to a quarter of adult patients were smokers.15 The effect of genetic predisposition (eg, the IFITM3 and CD55 polymorphisms) on H7N9 infection warrants further investigation.85, 86\n",

China uses more than 90% of the H5N1 vaccine worldwide.97 Although the H5 vaccine effectively suppresses the circulating clade of H5 virus in China, the vaccine cannot stop the emergence of antigenically drifted H5 and non-H5 viruses while biosecurity measures at wet markets and farms are suboptimum. Poor biosecurity allows the ready intrusion and amplification of a new virus reassortant.

Radiological features were similar in both infections: pulmonary consolidation (which progressed to involve bilateral lung fields), diffuse ground glass opacities, pleural effusions, and mediastinal emphysema. None of these clinical, laboratory, and radiological manifestations are pathognomonic for H7N9 infections. The definitive diagnosis depends on viral culture or real-time-PCR (RT-PCR) for the H7 and N9 gene targets from respiratory tract secretions. Because of the predilection of this virus for the lower respiratory tract, if available, sputum, endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage might give a better sensitivity than throat or nasopharyngeal specimens. However, point-of-care rapid antigen tests and multiplex RT-PCR assays have low sensitivity.99 Acute and convalescent serum antibody testing by haemagglutination inhibition or neutralisation can be useful for epidemiology or retrospective diagnosis. Any febrile patients with history of travel to affected areas, or contact with poultry or infected patients can be tested for H7N9 as a screening strategy for the early identification of imported cases.",

In the 1997 Hong Kong outbreak, temporary closure of live poultry markets and cessation of poultry trading were instituted. Subsequently, different poultry species were segregated to reduce the risk of further genetic reassortment. The regular cleansing of designated transport cages in live poultry markets was introduced to stop the virus trafficking between farms and markets. To interrupt the amplification of influenza virus, a monthly rest day with no live poultry allowed in the wet market was implemented in Hong Kong in July 2001. The isolation rate of H9N2 from poultry in live markets before the rest day could be as high as 10%, but reduced to less than 1% after the rest day.117 To further reduce the spread of influenza virus in wet markets, overnight poultry storage was banned in July 2008.118 A further 84% reduction in the isolation rate of H9N2 was reported. As in the H5N1 outbreak, poultry vaccination specifically against the H7N9 virus could probably reduce its transmission. A mathematical model showed that poultry vaccination with a matched H5N1 vaccine with coverage of only 30% of the poultry reduces the basic reproductive number to less than one.117\n",

Public education and administrative measures have also led to a slow change in eating habits from live chicken to chilled or frozen chicken. To reduce the contact between human beings and poultry in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Government implemented a voluntary surrender scheme in 2004, and subsequently a buyout scheme in 2008 for poultry retailers, wholesalers, transporters, and farmers. In 2006, domestic households were prohibited to keep any live poultry. With these measures, between 1997 and 2013, the number of local poultry farms in Hong Kong decreased from about 800 to 30 and the number of retail poultry stalls decreased from about 800 to 131. Since 1997, the number of imported live chickens was reduced from about 100 000 per day to 7000 per day. Enhanced surveillance of H5N1 and H7N9 in both live and dead wild birds, farm, and market poultries might be important for geographical areas along the migratory route of wild birds. With these measures, no local cases of H5N1 in Hong Kong have been identified since 2007, despite the failure to implement central slaughtering because of cultural resistance.",

The rapid increase in human beings infected with severe H7N9 to more than 130 cases within 2 months from March to May, 2013, is unprecedented for avian influenza viruses and could be related to enhanced transmissibility from poultry to human or improved virological testing. However, H7N9 is difficult to control because flock die-off did not precede human cases. Stringent measures to control the poultry outbreak will stop the human epidemic and perhaps decrease the risk of H7N9 evolving to become a pandemic agent.",

Biosecurity measures for live poultry markets, farms, and trafficking should be commensurate with increasing demand for poultry.
