Since it was firstly identified in the United States in 1987 and in Europe in 1990, PRRSV has caused one of the most economically important diseases of swine which is characterized by severe reproductive failure in sows and respiratory distress in piglets and growing pigs (Rossow, 1998). Infection with PRRSV also predisposes pigs to secondary infection by bacterial and viral pathogens, which may be due to the immunosuppression induced by the virus (Feng et al., 2001, Mateu and Diaz, 2008).",

            "text": "IFN-\u03b2 is the first responder against animal virus infection (Muller et al., 1994, Weber et al., 2004). When virus infects, the virus could be recognized by the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as membrane bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I). These PAMPs recruit different adaptor proteins, for example, TLRs recruits the adaptor molecule myeloid differentiation primary-response gene 88(MyD88) and Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN(TRIF) while RIG-I recruits virus-induced signaling adapter (VISA), to make TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) or I\u03baB kinase-\u025b (IKK-\u025b) phosphorylate IRF-3 and finally to induce IFN-\u03b2 transcription (Bowie and Unterholzner, 2008). Then, IFN-\u03b2 induces the IFN-regulated genes responsible for the antiviral response (Sadler and Williams, 2008). However, during the co-evolution with the host cells, many viruses have developed defensive mechanisms to inhibit IFN-\u03b2 production, making it difficult for host cells to defeat viral infection (Bowie and Unterholzner, 2008, Weber et al., 2004). Luo et al. (2008) and Miller et al. (2004) concluded that PRRSV does not induce IFN-\u03b2 in MARC-145 cells infected with PRRSV, but Luo et al. did not detect the level of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA by RT-PCR, and in Miller's paper, the level of IFN-\u03b2 appears a little higher in MARC-145 cells infected by PRRSV than that in control group, which may lead to a suspicion that whether PRRSV could induce IFN-\u03b2 production or not may be valued for verifying. Furthermore, Genini et al. (2008) and Loving et al. (2007) reported that PRRSV could induce the production of IFN-\u03b2 in primary swine cells, which supply a clue that maybe PRRSV could also induce the production of IFN-\u03b2 in MARC-145 cells. Previous studies have documented that SARS-CoV nsp3 could inhibit the IFN-\u03b2 production by its papain-like protease domain (Devaraj et al., 2007) and SARS-CoV N was capable of inhibiting IFN-\u03b2 production (Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007). It is a coincidence that PRRSV nsp1 also contained papain-like protease domain (den Boon et al., 1995) and the crystal structure of PRRSV N protein was similar to that of SARS-CoV N protein (Yu et al., 2006). So, the purpose of the present experiments is to analyze the patterns of IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity in MARC-145 cells during infection with PRRSV and to analyze whether PRRSV nsp1 and N protein could inhibit IFN-\u03b2 production.",

As shown in Fig. 1A, PRRSV could activate IFN-\u03b2 promoter in MARC-145 Cells at 24 h p.i., but the activity of IFN-\u03b2 promoter was much lower than that triggered by Poly(I:C). And the activity of IFN-\u03b2 promoter was rapidly inhibited in the following infection. The expression of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA was also analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR at the different time points after PRRSV infection and gotten the results similar to that of Fig. 1A (data not shown). To confirm this result, the level of pIRF-3 was also detected because pIRF-3 was a necessary transcription factor to the activation of IFN-\u03b2 promoter (Peters et al., 2002, Yoneyama et al., 1998). In consistent with the results of Fig. 1A, PRRSV could phosphorylate IRF-3 in early stage of infection (24 h p.i.), but after that, no detectable levels of pIRF-3 showed at certain time interval (Fig. 1B).",

The results indicated that PRRSV could trigger the activation of IRF-3 as well as induce the activation of IFN-\u03b2 promoter at 24 h p.i., but the activities were much lower than that triggered by the Poly(I:C). And their activities were rapidly inhibited in following infection (Fig. 1). So it is reasonable to speculate that PRRSV could be sensed by professional IFN-\u03b2-producing system and had mechanisms to inhibit this action in MARC-145 cells.",

Then through TBK1, TLR3 recruited TRIF and RIG-I recruited VISA to phosphorylate IRF-3 and finally activate IFN-\u03b2 promoter (Bowie and Unterholzner, 2008). Over-expression of RIG-I, VISA, TBK1 or TRIF could induce the activation of IRF-3 and promote the activation of IFN-\u03b2 promoter (Devaraj et al., 2007, Yoneyama et al., 2004, Zhong et al., 2008). Our data showed that nsp1 antagonized the IFN-\u03b2 production induced by RIG-I, VISA, TBK1 or TRIF, which indicated that nsp1 inhibited the IFN-\u03b2 production induced by both TLR3 and RIG-I pathways (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, nsp1 had no effect on the activity of IFN-\u03b2 promoter induced by IRF-3(5D), which suggested that nsp1 inhibited IFN-\u03b2 production by suppressing the activation of IRF-3. This speculation has been confirmed. PRRSV nsp1 down-regulated the protein level of IRF-3 and inhibited Poly(I:C)-induced phosphorylation of IRF-3, but had no effect on the level of IRF-3 mRNA (Fig. 4). Perhaps, nsp1 inhibited the translation of IRF-3 or induced the degradation of IRF-3 protein or inhibited the activation of kinase to phosphorylate IRF-3. SARS-CoV nsp3 inhibited phosphorylation of IRF-3 through its papain-like protease domain to be interacted with IRF-3 but did not down-regulated the protein level of IRF-3 (Devaraj et al., 2007), while the Npro protein of Classical Swine Fever Virus, similar to the group of papain-like proteases (Stark et al., 1993), could antagonize IRF-3 activity by inducing its proteasomal degradation (Bauhofer et al., 2007). PRRSV nsp1 also contains papain-like protease domain (den Boon et al., 1995) and PRRSV nsp1 down-regulated the protein level of IRF-3. So it is possible that PRRSV nsp1 inhibits the IRF-3 activation by inducing IRF-3 degradation or inhibits the activation of kinase to phosphorylate IRF-3. And this suppositional mechanism deserves a further study.",

Many viruses developed defensive mechanisms to inhibit IFN-\u03b2 production (Bowie and Unterholzner, 2008, Devaraj et al., 2007, Weber et al., 2004). The influenza virus NS1 protein, a multi-functional facilitator of virus replication, could antagonize the IFN-\u03b2 production (Hale et al., 2008). Deletion of the IFN-\u03b2 antagonist NS1 could produce a novel type of influenza vaccine (Wacheck et al., 2010). Novel antagonists against influenza virus NS1, only significantly and specifically inhibiting influenza A replication in cell capable of interferon production, could be a potential drug for influenza virus-treatment (Basu et al., 2009). Previous studies also showed intriguing observations that recombinant IFN-\u03b2 not only protected swine alveolar macrophages and MARC-145 cells from infection with PRRSV (Overend et al., 2007), but also could reduce the yield of PRRSV in vivo (Buddaert et al., 1998). Perhaps, inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 production leads to the persistent infection of PRRSV. Our data demonstrated that PRRSV could inhibit the IFN-\u03b2 production by PRRSV nsp1. In the future, it will be interesting to research on the function or characterization of PRRSV nsp1 in virus-induced immunosuppression and virus replication, and PRRSV nsp1 may be used as a potent target for exploiting new drags for PRRSV treatment or PRRSV vaccine.",

(A) The mRNA of nsp1 and N in MARC-145 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-nsp1 (nsp1), pcDNA3.1-N (N) or pcDNA3.1-His (Con) were analyzed by RT-PCR. Lanes 1\u20133 were amplified by PRRSV N primers, while lanes 4\u20136 were amplified by PRRSV nsp1 primers. (B) Western blot analyzed nsp1 and N protein by anti-His primary antibody in MARC-145 transfected with pcDNA3.1-nsp1 (nsp1) or pcDNA3.1-N (N). The control cells were transfected with pcDNA 3.1-His (Con). Since the nsp1 should be cleaved into nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 subunits, the arrow-pointed band was only the nsp1\u03b2 subunits. (C) MARC-145 cells were co-transfected with p-284 Luc, phRL-TK and different expression plasmid, and 24 h later, cells were either mock-treated (Con) or transfected with Poly(I:C) for 6 h. Cells were analyzed by dual luciferase reporter assay. (D) MARC-145 cells were co-transfected with p55C1B Luc, phRL-TK and different expression plasmid. Twenty four hours later, cells were either mock-treated (Con) or transfected with Poly(I:C) for 6 h. Cells were analyzed by dual luciferase reporter assay. LCPS was the luminescence counts per second detected by luminescence counting on the Microbeta-1450. Bars showed relative luciferase activity (Relative LCPS) normalized to phRL-TK activity (relative LCPS = LCPS of firefly-luciferase/LCPS of Renilla-luciferase). Data represented means of three replicates, and experiments were repeated three times.
