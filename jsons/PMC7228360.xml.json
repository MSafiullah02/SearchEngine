Shortly thereafter, there was a large increase in the number of patients who had not been to the seafood market, suggesting human\u2010to\u2010human transmission of 2019\u2010nCoV.\n4\n Pneumonia caused by this coronavirus was subsequently identified as a novel acute respiratory infectious disease and was named coronavirus disease (COVID\u201019) by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020.",

Clinical and laboratory data on admission were obtained from detailed medical records, collected in a standardized case report form by two experienced emergency doctors.

Laboratory tests included a complete blood count, serum biochemistry, interleukin\u20106 (IL\u20106) test, creatine kinase test, lactate dehydrogenase test, and tests for the identification of other respiratory pathogens.

In other words, 37% of the diagnosed patients did not a specific history of exposure to Hubei. About a third (32%) of negative cases also had a history of exposure, such as staying in Wuhan/Hubei. Therefore, a specific history of exposure to Hubei or infected patients no longer seems to be a requisite for patients with the suspected disease to be diagnosed with COVID\u201019, likely due to the increase in secondary infection of imported patients and potential undefined exposure to infected patients. We found objective clinical findings such as laboratory tests and chest CT findings in diagnosed patients with a definite exposure history were relatively specific than those without exposure history (Table 4). This may account for changes in the characteristics of the virus in secondary infections or potential infections. According to recent reports, SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 has been detected in the tears and conjunctival secretions of diagnosed patients.\n16\n Since the exact infection route is still not completely understood, even if patients deny a specific exposure history, potential unknown exposure can interfere with the judgment of ED physicians.",

Although all suspected patients were enrolled according to the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus infection (trial version III) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. Suspected patients not covered by the guidelines or not typical may not be admitted, resulting in a bias. In addition, the patients were only from the Anhui province; it is possible that other initial clinical features related to COVID\u201019 are observed outside Anhui and Hubei. Second, due to different times from illness onset to admission, and an incomplete collection of data, there was a lack of rigorous grouping and effective statistical analysis. Moreover, the time since illness onset might be shorter than the observation period of 10 days, which could result in biases of clinical observation characteristics.",

Definite exposure history to Hubei or infected patients may not be a requisite for diagnosis. Meanwhile, diagnosed patients without definite exposure history tend to show more atypical initial clinical features. Although we found differences in the initial clinical features of patients eventually confirmed to be infected, those differences were not specific and it seems far\u2010fetched to use them as a basis of early clinical diagnosis of COVID\u201019. For emergency physicians, a combination of epidemiological features, laboratory tests, and chest CT findings may be necessary to confirm the presence of infection. Nevertheless, we recommend strict medical quarantine and observation of all patients with suspected COVID\u201019 in the ED or dedicated quarantine facilities, irrespective of initial clinical features, especially in under\u2010resourced regions where rapid nucleic acid amplification tests are lacking.",
