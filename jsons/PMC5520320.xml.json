Bats were trapped at two locations (Ambohitantely and Anjohibe) using mist nets, harp traps and butterfly nets. In Anjohibe, several different species were trapped in a large cave network, whereas in Ambohitantely, two species were sampled at different sites: Myotis goudoti in a cave roost and Mormopterus jugularis in a public school. Rectal and buccal swabs were obtained using sterile rayon-tipped applicators (Puritan, Guilford, ME, USA). Pooled swabs from each individual bat (one rectal+one buccal swab) were placed in the same tube containing 1.5 mL of brain heart infusion medium (Conda, Madrid, Spain) supplemented with penicillin G (1000 units/mL), streptomycin (1 mg/mL), kanamycin (0.5 mg/mL), gentamicin (0.25 mg/mL) and amphotericin B (0.025 mg/mL), immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and subsequently transferred and stored in a \u221280 \u00b0C freezer.",

A difference in the mean detection rates between the Ambohitantely (1.96%\u00b13.81%) and the Anjohibe (30.7%\u00b18.02%) sites was also observed (\u03c72=23.2, P<0.001). This result may be affected by a sampling bias between the two sites (51 bats sampled in Ambohitantely versus 127 in Anjohibe) or may reflect species- and site-related variation in AstV infection. Repeated sampling of the same bat populations would be needed to examine potential seasonal variations in virus transmission between hosts and locations.",

High sequence diversity is commonly described in bat AstVs,3 with studies reporting potentially novel AstV species in these hosts.9, 13, 14 The coalescent analysis provided further evidence of this considerable diversity and the low degree of host restriction (Figure 1). For instance, the two viruses detected in Rousettus madagascariensis were more genetically related to AstVs found in Miniopterus griveaudi and in Triaenops menamena than to each other. The close proximity of bat roosting sites in the Anjohibe cave network may favor virus transmission between species and, more broadly, the infection of a large diversity of hosts sharing these habitats. The sequence detected in Myotis goudoti at Ambohitantely was closely related to one of the two sequences detected in the same species at Anjohibe, further suggesting that AstVs may easily spread within bat populations. Low levels of host restriction and limited phylogenetic clustering between viruses detected at distant locations have also been reported in other studies in Asia, Europe and Africa,3 although the ecological drivers of AstV epidemiology and evolution remain to be determined.4",
