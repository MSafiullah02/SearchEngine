(EUTMR) . This was the first time the CJEU has given a judgment on this provision. Starting from the presumption that Art. 7(1)(f) EUTMR interferes with freedom of expression (2), we argue that applying an empirical test under Art. 7 (1)(f) EUTMR is incompatible with freedom of expression (3). We then assess whether and to what extent the test developed by the CJEU is empirical (4), before pointing out potential shortcomings of that test (5).",

            "text": "2 Art. 7(1)(f) EUTMR Interferes with Freedom of Expression While the General Court (GC) at first instance stated that ''in the field of art, culture and literature, there is a constant striving to preserve freedom of expression, which does not exist in the field of trade mark law'', 2 the Advocate General (AG) disagreed with this statement, 3 as did the CJEU. 4 The CJEU's finding that ''freedom of expression, enshrined in Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, must [\u2026] be taken into account when applying Article 7(1)(f)'' is in line with its settled case law according to which all measures of the EU must observe fundamental rights 5 and was also prompted by the recitals of the EUTMR. 6 Although the GC's statement was corrected, the judgment remains silent on how freedom of expression should have affected the outcome of the decision. Freedom of expression was not considered in the CJEU's interpretation of Art. 7 (1)(f) EUTMR. The AG also explicitly wondered what the confirmation that freedom of expression applies in the field of trade mark law ''brings to the solution of the present case'', 7 without further pursuing this route. He pointed out that ''the Appellant also had some difficulty in explaining precisely how expressly taking on board freedom of expression should have altered the test under Article 7(1)(f)' '. 8 However, if the refusal to register a mark interferes with freedom of expression as enshrined in both Art. 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU (CFR) and Art. 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), this makes for an argument regarding the interpretation of Art. 7(1)(f) EUTMR. The provision would have to be interpreted in a way which makes this inference justified. The interference with freedom of expression and/or a serious issue with its justification in relation to morality bars have generally been contested by the EUIPO as well as 2 GC, Case T-69/17, Fack Ju G\u00f6hte, 24 January 2018, para. 29 . 3 See AG, Case C-240/18 P, Fack Ju G\u00f6hte, 2 July 2019, paras. 45-57. The AG was also open to a reading of the GC's statement under which freedom of expression potentially carries less weight in the balancing of interests in trade mark law compared to the other areas mentioned, ibid. para. 56. 4 CJEU, Case C-240/18 P, Fack Ju G\u00f6hte, 27 February 2020, para. 56 .

Art. 51(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. 6 Recital 21 of EUTMR expressively states that it should be applied in a way that ensures full respect for fundamental rights and freedoms. 7 AG, Case C-240/18 P, Fack Ju G\u00f6hte, 2 July 2019, para. 52. 8 AG, ibid. para. 54.",

Applying this requirement to the refusal of a trademark application, the ECtHR found a wide margin of appreciation for the regulation of advertising when assessing its proportionality. 17 The CJEU's judgment remains silent on the rationale behind Art. 7(1)(f) EUTMR. We will therefore assess the proportionality of an empirical approach to morality on a hypothetical level, that is in relation to the aims which are most often being proposed as standing behind morality bars to trade mark registration, 18 namely to support objective values in society (3.3.1), to reduce harm (3.3.2), and to prevent the perception of endorsement (3.3.3). Also, we will discuss the proposal to treat morality as a subcategory of distinctiveness (3.3.4).",

For that reason, an empirical approach does not assist the state's attempts to enforce objective moral values. 20 Instead, it turns the is into an ought, merely preserving the status quo of individual beliefs, independent of an objective framework of moral values. Additionally, the refusal to register cannot even effectively preserve the status quo, since the individual beliefs are due to change for reasons other than (non-)registration of a trade mark, because the refusal to register a sign in itself does not hinder (even commercial) usage of such sign due to the nature of a trade mark as a negative right. All that an empirical approach appears to do is slow down societal change without any apparent justification for such preservation. If one wants to see Art. 7(1)(f) EUTMR as a policy tool to strengthen objective values, its efficacy under an empirical approach is a matter of coincidence, that is whether the supported objective values match the status quo of subjective beliefs.",

Indeed, an empirical approach is able to identify a problem -that is, a clash of (a) personal beliefs with (b) a certain trade mark resulting in (c) negative emotions.

This holds especially true since denying a sign trade mark protection pursuant to Art. 7(1)(f) EUTMR does not as such prevent the use of that sign in commerce or otherwise. Looking at empirical evidence, 25 one could argue that morality bars are not (very) effective in reducing the use of such signs, in turn also rendering Art. 7(1)(f) EUTMR incapable of reducing harm by way of reducing the use of such signs. 21 (2015), p. 61, and OHIM, Case R 495/2005-G, SCREW YOU, 6 July 2006, para. 14. 23 For an example of how to combine subjective offensiveness with objective values see ECtHR, Appl.

The message contrary to a person's subjective values ''will dominate source identification''. 27 This understanding necessarily entails an empirical concept, since the assumption of superimposition builds on the actual effect the sign has on people. 28 However, this assumption, and thus the idea that Art. 7(1)(f) EUTMR serves the primary goal of trade mark protection, is strongly contested. 29 An understanding of Art. Grynbert (2016), p. 189. 28 There is an argument to be made that the idea of superimposing meanings goes well together with the obligations from the Paris Convention, because it includes an assessment of all factual circumstances, including the length of use, as required by Art. 6 quinquies C PC also in the case of telle-quelle marks which are rejected on grounds of morality according to Art. distinctiveness.

However, in a pluralistic society absolute conformity and consensus is impossible and also goes against the fundamental principles of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness inherent to every democratic society. 35 These considerations relate back to the core essence of freedom of expression and the essential foundations of a democratic society. 36 Likewise, they are a prerequisite for societal progress. 37 Therefore, even expressions that may be received or regarded as 32 38 Hence, there is a conflict between an empirical approach essentially focusing on (majority) opinion and the core concept of freedom of expression. 39 Taking some portion of the population's opinion as the benchmark for assessing morality under Art. 7(1)(f) EUTMR would favor the subjective beliefs of some portion of society over those of others.

However, the overall test sounds less factual/empirical than the first component and includes potentially normative elements. Interestingly enough, ''public opinion'' is only one of the elements to be taken into account. 51 The most important point is the normative construction of a fictional person, on whose perception the whole assessment is to be based. The notion of ''average thresholds of sensitivity and tolerance'' ties in with the idea of some people being easily offended or not offended at all. 52 It is potentially normative, because it filters out those opinions of members of the relevant public which are ''extreme'' before the empirical assessment takes place, not based on the specific mark in question, but as a general characteristic of a fictional member of the public. A pure factual assessment would include all members of the relevant public, giving less weight to the opinions of the extremes, but not completely disregarding them. Conveniently, factoring out the opinions of ''extreme people'' circumvents the hard question of 47 51 It is to be supplemented by legislation and administrative practices. The relevance of the latter raises the question whether legislation/administrative practice shall be treated as a mere indication of the underlying factual perception by the relevant public, or whether this means looking for objective values posited in the law or discernable from practice. 52 Cf.

This is even more so regarding the notion of a ''reasonable'' person. While ''average'' could still be construed as being a matter of fact, what is ''reasonable'' is hardly an empirical question. This is, in the end, up to the deciding authorities. In sum, even if the relevant public does in fact perceive a sign as contrary to fundamental moral values, the deciding bodies can disregard this result by finding such perception unreasonable. It must be reiterated that this normative element only concerns the second component of the test, i.e. whether a sign is contrary to morality. The first component, defining the values making up the accepted principles of morality, still seems to be purely empirical.",

            "text": "In light of freedom of expression, the CJEU's test appears problematic for two reasons. First, insofar as the test is empirical, any refusal of ''immoral'' signs is tainted with the problems discussed in the Sect. 3 above. Second, the test seems to lack foreseeability. This puts pressure on the requirement that an interference with freedom of expression is ''prescribed by law'' under Art. 10(2) ECHR. Even though the broad wording of a provision restricting freedom of expression, such as the term ''morality'', is not in and of itself problematic, it is necessary that its interpretation in practice is accessible to the affected party and foreseeable with regard to its effects, so that they are able to adjust their behavior accordingly. 53 Consistent, clear and abundant case law can suffice to fulfill this requirement. 54 Otherwise, the restriction imposed on freedom of expression may not be regarded as ''prescribed by law'' in the sense of Art. 10(2) ECHR, and thus not justified. 55 It is doubtful that this judgment can be seen as a step towards the necessary clarification, especially given the de facto absence of traceable reasoning. The only interpretative tool used by the CJEU was that of a term's usual meaning and the context in which it is generally used. 56 In contrast to other decisions, however, the usual meaning of the term was not even established in relation to everyday language let alone the legislative context or the purpose of the provision. 57 The only trace is a reference to the similar definition by the AG. 58 This lack of any interpretive signposts takes away from the transparency of the decision and adds to the legal uncertainty surrounding the test. The lack of purposive interpretation also means that the judgment is of little help in answering the question whether Art. 7(1)(f) EUTMR does pursue legitimate aims (and is proportionate in relation to these aims) under Art. 10(2) ECHR.",

As our analysis has shown, such guidance might have led away from an empirical approach to morality. The seemingly empirical elements of the CJEU's test as well as its lack of clarity and foreseeability deserve a critical appraisal in light of freedom of expression. This could possibly be delivered indirectly, in a case concerning the morality bar of national trade mark law harmonised by Art. 4(1)(f) of the EU Trade Mark Directive, and potentially by the ECtHR itself. Given the numerous recent applications relating to the coronavirus across the EU, there should be no shortage of refusals based on morality in the near future.",

The individual subjective beliefs (values) of the members of society form the benchmark, not because these values are by themselves objectively binding norms, but because they are the empirical fact that this approach deems decisive. 11 Thus, the empirical approach can be characterised as descriptive, inductive or ''bottomup''. 12 It can be contrasted with a normative (or ''top-down'') approach under which objective values are deduced from normative sources, e.g. positive law. 13 Under such normative approach, these values are, as such, binding. Morality, then, is a matter of reasoning, not of facts. Subjective values and objective values may match, but it is the particular approach that matters, not the individual outcome of a case.
