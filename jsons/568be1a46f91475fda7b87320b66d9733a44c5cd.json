            "text": "Following the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), studies suggest that the resultant disease is more severe in individuals with a weakened immune system. Cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs) and Natural Killer (NK) cells are required to generate an effective immune response against viruses, functional exhaustion of which enables disease progression. Patients with severe COVID-19 present significantly lower lymphocyte, and higher neutrophil, counts in blood. Specifically, CD8 + lymphocytes and NK cells were significantly reduced in cases of severe infection compared to patients with mild infection and healthy individuals. The NK group 2 member A (NKG2A) receptor transduces inhibitory signalling, suppressing NK cytokine secretion and cytotoxicity. Overexpression of NKG2A has been observed on CD8 + and NK cells of COVID-19 infected patients compared to healthy controls, while NKG2A overexpression also functionally exhausts CD8 + cells and NK cells, resulting in a severely compromised innate immune response. Blocking NKG2A on CD8 + cells and NK cells in cancers modulated tumor growth, restoring CD8 + T and NK cell function. A recently proposed mechanism via which SARS-CoV-2 overrides innate immune response of the host is by over-expressing NKG2A on CD + T and NK cells, culminating in functional exhaustion of the immune response against the viral pathogen. Monalizumab is an inhibiting antibody against NKG2A which can restore the function of CD8 + T and NK cells in cancers, successfully ceasing tumor progression with no significant side effects in Phase 2 clinical trials. We hypothesize that patients with severe COVID-19 have a severely compromised innate immune response and could be treated via the use of Monalizumab, interferon \u03b1, chloroquine, and other antiviral agents.",

Most patients initially present with flu-like symptoms progressing to a sore throat, cough, breathlessness, and chest pain. Most symptomatic patients develop lymphopenia and pneumonia with a characteristic ground glass appearance following a CT Scan [1, 7, 8] . Patients with severe COVID-19 exhibited high levels of an array of proinflammatory cytokines in their blood, including IL-2, IL-7, IL10, IP-10, TNF-\u03b1, G-CSF, MCP-1 and MIP-1A [1] .

Although the main pathogenesis of SARS-CoV is thought to be through direct infection of macrophages and T cells, whether SARS-CoV-2 infects immune cells is not known [11] . The proposed mechanism of injury by SARS-CoV-2 includes: 1) Infection of ACE-2 expressing target cells such as immune cells; 2) Suppression of interferon-responses leading to uncontrolled viral replication; 3) Increased influx of neutrophils and macrophages with release of proinflammatory cytokines leading to lung injury; and 4) Specific Th1/Th17 activation resulting in B cell activation and further inflammatory response via antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 [5] .",

We also propose that such suppression of the innate immune response occurs via over-expression of NKG2A (an inhibitory receptor) on CD8 + and NK cells, leading to their reduction and an increase in opportunistic and coinfections of the lung in COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms. We posit that such severe symptoms could perhaps be alleviated by treatment with Monalizumab, a drug that has successfully cleared Phase 2 clinical trials, by inhibtiing NKG2A receptors and restoring CD8 + T and NK cell function as previously recorded in a number of cancers. Finally, perhaps a combination of Chloroquine, antivirals, interferons, and broad-based antibiotics can prevent co-infections and severe infections of the lung which culminates in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure.",
