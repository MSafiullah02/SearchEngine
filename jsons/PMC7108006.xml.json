Autophagy is an important response to cellular starvation and is involved in development, differentiation, and remodeling.

In mutant cells deficient in autophagy, S. pyogenes instead multiplied, with release of large numbers of viable bacteria from the cell.",

M. tuberculosis survives within phagocytic cells as a result of its ability to interfere with the phagosome maturation pathway, resulting in failure of phagosome-lysosome fusion. However, autophagy can be induced in infected macrophages by nutrient restriction or by IFN-\u03b3, resulting in reduced mycobacterial viability. The action of IFN-\u03b3 is independent of reactive nitrogen or oxygen activity. Autophagy also appears to play a role in defense against other intracellular pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, an organism that escapes into the cytosol by causing membrane lysis, only to potentially be greeted by an autophagosome.",
