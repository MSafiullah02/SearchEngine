After a worldwide intensive investigation, a specific novel form of human coronavirus (CoV), denoted SARS-CoV, was identified as the pathogenic agent behind this epidemic (Peiris et al. 2004). The maturation and production of the infectious progeny of SARS-CoV involves proteolytic processing of the virus polyproteins by a main protease (Mpro) (also called 3CLpro because of its 3\u2032-proximal chymotrypsin-like catalytic domain) and a papain-like protease (PLpro).",

Coronaviruses are enveloped positive-sense, single-strand RNA viruses. The genome length of SARS-CoV is around 30,000 nucleotides and its replicase gene encodes two overlapping polyproteins, polyprotein 1a (pp1a) (486 kDa) and polyprotein 1ab (1a + 1b) (790 kDa) (Fig. 8.1a).

This protease is a homodimer in which the two subunits are arranged perpendicularly to each other (Fig. 8.3a). Each protomer of SARS-CoV Mpro comprises 13 strands and 11 helices distributed among three distinct structural domains. The first two domains (residues 8\u2013101 for domain I and 102\u2013184 for domain II) have an antiparallel \u03b2-barrel structure, which has a folding scaffold similar to other viral chymotrypsin-like proteases (Anand et al. 2002; Hegyi et al. 2002; Ziebuhr et al. 2003). Each subunit also has its own substrate binding site with a His41\u2013Cys145 catalytic dyad located at the interface between domains I and II. However, unlike chymotrypsin, the active site of SARS-CoV Mpro contains a catalytic cysteinyl residue instead of a seryl residue. Furthermore, SARS-CoV Mpro contains an extra domain (III) consisting of five \u03b1-helices (residues 201\u2013306), which is a specific feature of coronavirus main proteases. This helical domain III is linked to domain II by a long loop (residues 185\u2013200) (Fig. 8.2a).\n\n",

The N-terminal domain (I + II) without domain III folds into a structure that is indistinguishable from the intact chymotrypsin-like fold but is enzymatically inactive (Chang et al. 2007). The extra domain III of SARS-CoV Mpro increases the structural stability of the catalytic domain. This may be achieved by increasing the folding rate of domains I and II, which would thus increase the overall stability of the protein. Furthermore, domain III is related to the quaternary structure of Mpro, which has important functional implications for this enzyme.",

            "text": "A coronavirus Mpro (from transmissible gastroenteritis virus) was the first viral protease shown to be dimeric, both in its crystal form and in solution (Anand et al. 2002). Significantly, SARS-CoV Mpro also exists as a dimer in solution (Chou et al. 2004) and both its N- and C-terminal residues are involved in dimer formation. The N-terminal finger (N-finger, containing residues 1\u20137) of subunit A extends from domain I toward domain III and forms intensive interactions with subunit B. The side chain of Arg4 at the N-finger fits into a pocket of subunit B and forms a salt bridge with Glu290 that constitutes one of the major interactions between the two subunits (Chou et al. 2004). In addition, the subunit interfacial region of the enzyme contains many hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds (Fig. 8.3b). The interactions between the N-terminus and the other monomer play an important role in maintaining the active site integrity of the dimer (Lin et al. 2008; Chen et al. 2008b; Zhong et al. 2008). Importantly, the dimeric form of SARS-CoV Mpro is the biologically functional form of this enzyme (Anand et al. 2002; Shi et al. 2008) and dissociation of the subunits yields enzymatically inactive monomers (Shi et al. 2004; Fan et al. 2004; Chang et al. 2007).",

N-terminal truncation of the whole N-finger results in almost complete loss of enzymatic activity (Hsu et al. 2005b). Critical N-terminal amino acid residues to Arg4 and C-terminal to Gln299 have been identified as those involved in dimerization, thus generating the correct conformation of the active site (Hsu et al. 2005b; Lin et al. 2008). The C-terminal helical domain interacts with the active site of another protomer in the dimer and switches the enzyme molecule from the inactive form to the active form (Shi et al. 2004). Hsu et al. (2005a) have proposed an autocleavage mechanism, which explains the dimeric nature of the mature enzyme.",

However, its intrinsic insensitivity is in fact a distinct advantage of using colorimetric analysis for Mpro. In the case of Mpro activity, to confirm a direct correlation between the quaternary structure of the protease and its enzyme activity, a method that can simultaneously monitor protein dissociation and enzyme inactivation is highly desirable. Analytical ultracentrifugation with a band-forming centerpiece is ideal for this task (Harding and Rowe 1996). The substrate is diluted in buffer and loaded into the ultracentrifuge cell. Deuterium oxide, sucrose, or glycerol can be used to increase the density of this substrate solution. The band-forming centerpiece has small drilled-out holes to accommodate the enzyme solution, which is separated from the substrate before the application of the centrifugal force. Upon commencing centrifugation, the enzyme solution, which is less dense than the substrate solution, will form a thin layer on top of the separation column. The enzymatic reaction will start at the bound interface. During ultracentrifugation, the separation of monomer and dimer bands can be monitored by UV absorption, whereas the enzyme activity levels can be assessed by the absorption at 405 nm if p-nitroanilide-peptide is used. The advantage of then using a colorimetric detector is that the k\ncat value of Mpro is low enough to allow large amounts of protein to be used. If fluorogenic substrates are used, the sensitivity of enzymatic reaction will be such that the protein levels may be below the threshold of detection.",

In Mpro, a stable water molecule occupies the Asp position of the typical serine protease triad and this molecule might play a role in stabilizing the imidazolium ring during catalysis (Bartlam et al. 2005). Mutations at the catalytic dyad residues (H41A and C145A) almost completely abolish enzymatic activity and these mutant enzymes exist exclusively as dimers (Huang et al. 2004; Chang et al. 2007). However, mutation of Cys145 to Ser results in a partially active enzyme. These results are consistent with the notion that in the chemical mechanism underlying Mpro activity, His41 acts as a general base during the deacylation step and that the catalytic dyad involving Cys145 and His41 is left uncharged (Huang et al. 2004; Solowiej et al. 2008).",

These thiopurine compounds are currently used clinically to treat children with acute lymphoblastic or myeloblastic leukemia (Pui and Evans 1998; Elion 1989) and the adverse toxicities of these drugs are well documented.

In addition, the functional unit of Mpro is a dimer and there is a close correlation between dimer formation and catalytic activity. A flip-flop mechanism is proposed for Mpro in which its two subunits are alternately used in acylation and deacylation steps. The subunit interfacial region of the main protease is an ideal target for rational drug design in the future treatment of SARS-CoV. Inhibitors of PLpro are also potential avenues for developing anti-SARS therapies.",

The N-terminal half peptide is released as the first product whereas the C-terminal half acylates the active site Cys145 residue. The acylated intermediate is then deacylated, releasing the C-terminal peptide, and this completes the catalytic cycle. His41 acts as a catalytic general base in the deacylation step.
