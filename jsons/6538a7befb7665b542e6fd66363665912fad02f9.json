In this paper, the codon usage bias in the mature IFN-a sequence of giant panda and 15 reference species have been analyzed. The results showed that the synonymous codons with G and C at the third codon position were widely used and the ENC-GC3S plot revealed that the genetic heterogeneity in IFN-a gene was main constrained by mutational bias. Contrastive analysis revealed that there were 40 codons showing distinct usage differences between GpIFN-a and Escherichia coli, 38 codons between GpIFN-a and yeast. and only 30 between GpIFN-a and Homo sapiens. Therefore the Homo expression system may be more suitable for the expression of GpIFN-a genes.",

So the genetic code is necessarily redundant which are more than amino acids. Each amino acid is encoded by between one (Met and Trp) and six (Arg, Leu and Ser) synonymous codons [2] . Different codons that encode the same amino acid are known as synonymous codons. Changes in the DNA sequence of a protein between two synonymous codons are often assumed to have no effect and are thus called synonymous changes or even silent changes [2] . In a wide variety of organisms such as bacteria, fungi, and insects (Sharp et al. 1992) , codons within synonymous groups are used with different frequencies [3] [4] [5] [6] the phenomenon called codon usage bias.",

However, several other causes have also been reported, such as GC compositions, gene length, gene expression level, gene translation initiation signal, protein amino acid composition, protein structure, mutation frequency and patterns, and tRNA abundance [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . In some other researches, it was also found that codon usage was related to gene function [13, 14] and cellular location of gene products [15] [16] [17] . Whatever the reasons for codon bias, it has become increasingly clear that codon biases can have profound impacts on the expression of heterologous proteins.",

The effective number of codons (ENC) is a measure analogous to the effective number of alleles. Based on simulation studies, ENC appears to be low sensitive to gene length [23] . The ENC value of the IFN-a gene of each reference was computed with the EMBOSS CHIPS online service program. The degree of synonymous-codon usage bias was also measured by the codon adaptation index (CAI) which estimates the extent of bias toward codons that are known to be favored in highly expressed genes. which was calculated with the EMBOSS CAI program [24] . The peculiarity in codon usage frequency ,the G+C content of the gene sequences and the G+C content at the synonymous third position of codons (GC3S) were also calculated with the EMBOSS CUSP program [25] .",

A high level of diversity in codon usage bias existed for coding the Ala, Leu and Ser amino acids(emphasized with underline). From the table 2 we can see that the frequencies of codons usage in coding the same amino acids are different. There are 26 codons, such as CTG(Leu), AGG (Arg), ATC(Ile), CCC(Pro), TGG(Trp), TAC(Tyr) and so on, were more frequently used.

As it is related to the carrier molecular of genetic information(DNA) and functional molecular (protein) of life, this phenomenon implicates important biological sense [27] . Extensive studies had shown that synonymous codon usage in various organisms. Although the codon usage pattern among different species is a complex phenomenon, it plays an important role in illuminating the underlying mechanisms of codon usage patterns in order to understand the evolution of the species. Signal peptides consist of short stretches of amino acids which, after protein delivery to the correct subcellular compartment, are frequently removed by specialized signal peptidases [28] . Only after removal of the signal peptide sequence, the precursor protein may be allowed to entry into the secretory pathway and become a normal function of the mature protein [29] . We intend to express the GpIFN-a gene in prokaryotic expression system and test its antiviral effects in future. In order to keep the higher biological activity, we cloned the gene fragment coding for mature protein of GpIFN-a. In this study, we analyzed the codon usage data of GpIFN-a without signal peptide and those of other 15 species of IFN-a, Additionally, we investigated the correlation of codon usage between GpIFN-a gene with Escherichia coli, yeast, and Homo sapiens to find the suitable expression system. RSCU, CAI, ENC values, GC and GC3s content of the IFN-\u03b1 gene were predicted by using the EMBOSS CUSP program and CHIPS program. RSCU with direct assessment codon usage bias of different codons in each gene sample. When its value greater than 1.0 indicated that the corresponding codon was used more frequently than expected. Table 2 showed that there were 26 preferred codons\uff0cmost of them were strong bias towards the synonymous codons with G and C in the wobble, coincides with high G+C content at the third codon position (the mean value was 76.85%). CAI was used as a measure to predict the level of gene expression.The value was between 0 and 1 [30] , a higher value means a stronger codon usage bias and a higher expression level. the CAI values for IFN-\u03b1 genes were slight variation among different species and with a mean value of 0.808, so we concluded IFN-\u03b1 gene was likely to be moderately expressed in giant panda genome. The ENC is a measure analogous to the effective number of alleles. It ranges from 20, where only one codon is used for each amino acid to 61 if all codons are used equally [31] . In general, if the ENC value of a gene is 35 or less, that gene is thought to possess strong codon bias [32] . Analyzing the ENC values of all the IFN-\u03b1 genes, the results showed the ENC values of mammal's IFN-\u03b1 genes(mean value of 45.26) were higher than birds' IFN-\u03b1 gene(mean value of 30.20) , So the codon usage bias was slightly low in mammal but strong in bird.",
