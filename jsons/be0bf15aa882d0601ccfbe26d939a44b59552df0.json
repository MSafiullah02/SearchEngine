Food handler-associated foodborne illness results from the manual preparation of food by an infected food handler shedding viruses, usually resulting in limited outbreaks [14] , although their size may be substantial depending on the nature of the contamination. A problem is that food-handlers may transmit viruses before showing symptoms, or have asymptomatic infections [15, 16] . Food contamination can also occur during primary production, as has been observed in particular in fresh produce such as berries and green onions, or bivalve filter-feeding shellfish. Here the nature of contamination is dependent on location of the production area and nature of sewage contamination. In contrast to food handler-associated contamination, production process contamination events may involve multiple pathogens present in sewage, including animal viruses [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Zoonotic foodborne infection occurs when meat, organs, or other products from an infected animal are consumed. For viruses, this may be the least common mode of transmission, although the potential for such transmission is a cause for concern with every emerging disease outbreak.",

Foodborne pathogens share the mode of transmission (fecal-oral) and their ability to infect hosts following oral inoculation. Symptoms may arise from replication and the ensuing damage and inflammatory responses in the intestinal tract, but also from generalised infection as observed for instance for orally transmitted hepatitis viruses the ensuing damage and inflammatory responses in the intestinal tract, but also from generalised infection as observed for instance for orally transmitted hepatitis viruses (hepatitis A and E), or neurotropic enteroviruses. The greatest burden of foodborne viral disease has been attributed to noroviruses and hepatitis A ( Fig. 9.1 ). In addition to these endemic pathogens, the potential for foodborne transmission is a key question in every emerging disease outbreak. In fact, zoonotic emerging infections can be introduced into the population through food preparation or consumption, although these risks are minimal with proper food preparation. Commonly studied in relation to food are viruses from the families Picornaviridae (polio-, entero-, coxsackie-, echo-, and hepatitis A viruses), Reoviridae (rotaviruses), Adenoviridae (adenoviruses 40, 41 primarily), Caliciviridae (noro-and sapoviruses), Hepeviridae (hepatitis E virus), and Astroviridae (Mamastroviruses). They replicate initially in the intestinal tract, are environmentally stable, are shed in high numbers in the faeces of infected individuals with up to 10 11 virus particles per gram of stool being documented, and are highly infectious with only 10-100 viral particles required for transmission [24, 25] . There is no systematic surveillance for foodborne viral diseases, despite the high burden of disease estimates from some countries [8, 26, 27] . The Food epidemiology reference group (FERG) of the World Health Organisation is currently preparing a global burden of foodborne disease estimate, but the underlying systematic reviews have already signalled large data gaps, particularly from resource limited regions [28] .",

            "text": "A combination of factors is responsible for the lack of knowledge of the true incidence of foodborne viral illness. A case of foodborne illness is only identified when a patient falls ill, seeks medical help and undergoes diagnostic testing which leads to identification of the aetiological agent. For some pathogens with long incubation periods (e.g. hepatitis A and E), even when diagnosed, identification of a food source may be extremely difficult due to the long delay between exposure and symptom onset. A third factor compromising the ability to detect foodborne disease is the high rate of asymptomatic infections associated with some pathogens. Therefore, linked cases are difficult to detect. These challenges in diagnosis of foodborne diseases are illustrated by the fact that \"unrecognized agents\" account for up to 81 % of all U.S. foodborne illnesses and hospitalizations and 64 % of deaths [8, 27, 29] . Rapid population growth and urbanization, deforestation, invasion of previously pristine habitats for agriculture, and increasing demand for animal protein all likely contribute to increased emergence of novel infectious disease threats, while climate change and the increasing global connectedness and mobility facilitate their global spread [30] . Consequently, the pattern of disease outbreaks has changed, from localized clusters of disease in confined populations to dispersed outbreaks with excellent opportunity for further transmission. Similarly, a transition is observed from localized foodborne epidemics to diffuse international foodborne outbreaks due to globalization of the food market [31] . The foodborne nature is often disguised by person-to-person transmission after the initial infection(s) because of the highly infectious nature of most foodborne viral pathogens. Some of these viruses are of major public health concern amongst others because of their food-or waterborne nature, low infectious dose required for infection and serious health-related implications and associated costs.",

Rotaviruses are non-enveloped double-stranded segmented RNA viruses from the family Reoviridae. The genus Rotavirus contains eight species numbered A-H of which A-C are encountered in humans [45] . Rotavirus A infection is the most common cause of severe gastroenteritis in infants and young children worldwide. Rotavirus B has been found mainly in adults with diarrhoea in China, Bangladesh and India. The viral nucleocapsid outermost layer contains two structural proteins VP4 and VP7 that define the serotype of the virus and are considered critical in vaccine development; more than 40 serotypes have been identified [46] . By the age of five nearly every child has been infected with rotavirus A at least once, the majority of which is anticipated to be symptomatic. The spectrum of rotavirus A disease ranges from mild watery diarrhoea to severe diarrhoea with vomiting and moderate fever. Infection can result in death due to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance that is profuse and life threatening amongst others due to the action of a unique virus encoded enterotoxin NSP4 [47] . The severe impact is primarily observed in young children <2 years of age and can be treated by oral rehydration therapy. Symptoms generally resolve within 3-7 days. Subsequent infections occur from birth to old age but natural immunity renders most of these infections asymptomatic. Rotavirus A is shed in high concentrations in the stool of infected persons and is transmitted via the oral-faecal route with <100 virus particles being sufficient for transmission [45, 48, 49] . Infections occur mainly in late winter or early spring in Europe and colder/drier times of the year in the tropics [50] [51] [52] . Rotavirus A vaccines were introduced in 2006, but prior to vaccination policies, rotaviruses caused ~3 million disease episodes per annum in the USA, requiring 500,000 visits to physicians and 60,000 hospitalisations, leading to 20-40 deaths [45, [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] . Similar observations were done in Europe [58, 59] . In developing countries rotavirus A infections cause millions of diarrhoea cases, almost two million hospitalizations and an estimated 453,000 infections result in the death of a child younger than 5 years of age annually worldwide [6, 44, 60] . The introduction of proper hygienic measures, clean drinking water, oral rehydration therapy and rotavirus A vaccines reduced disease burden in both developed and developing countries [45] .",

The genus Norovirus is divided into seven genogroups (GI-GVII) that are further subdivided into numerous genotypes [61] . The GI, II, and IV are capable of infecting humans [62] , and GII.4 has been associated with the majority of global outbreaks since the mid-1990s. The other genogroups have not been detected in humans, but systematic studies evaluating their role are lacking. Norovirus infections are a leading cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks among all age groups and are transmitted directly from person to person and indirectly via contaminated water and food [63, 64] . They are extremely contagious requiring low viral loads for transmission and are common in closed settings such as healthcare facilities, cruise ships, and nursing homes [24] . The infection can cause nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhoea and abdominal pain, although asymptomatic infections are common [48] . The disease is usually self-limiting, and severe illness is rare in developed countries. Ahmed and coworkers noted a gradient of decreasing prevalence from community to outpatient to inpatient groups, which supports the notion that norovirus is a more common cause of mild acute gastroenteritis [28] , although in the USA norovirus infections result in ~70,000 hospitalizations and 800 deaths yearly [65] [66] [67] . In developing countries, noroviruses are estimated to cause more than 200,000 deaths annually among children younger than 5 years of age, and it is predicted that these viruses will become the predominant cause of diarrhoea in all age groups worldwide once rotavirus infection is controlled through vaccination [68] [69] [70] [71] . The economic impact of foodborne related norovirus gastroenteritis outbreaks is high with an estimated $2 billion healthcare related costs in the USA alone [72] .",

Humans are the only naturally known reservoir for hepatitis A viruses and ~5 % of foodborne viral disease is attributed to hepatitis A virus infection [29] . The virus is spread via the faecal-oral route and the disease is closely associated with inadequate sanitation, poor personal hygiene, and limited access to clean water [73] [74] [75] . In developing countries, most children are infected with hepatitis A virus by the age of 10 years and the disease is usually asymptomatic in this age group. Epidemics in these countries are practically non-existent as older children and adults are immune to reinfection. In countries with improved sanitary conditions and transitional economies, the rate of infection in young children is lower, resulting in a higher susceptibility of older children and adults and larger outbreaks of disease. The incubation period is 14-28 days and symptoms range from mild to severe, and can include fever, malaise, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal discomfort, dark-coloured urine and jaundice which last for up to 8 weeks. Some 10-15 % of people experience a recurrence of symptoms during the 6 months after the initial infection and fulminant hepatitis and acute liver failure occurs although rarely and is most common in the elderly [4, 76] . In developed countries, hepatitis A infection is uncommon and predominantly associated with high-risk groups, such as people travelling to areas of high endemicity. Hepatitis A viruses are stable in the environment and can resist food-production processes routinely used to inactivate and/or control bacterial pathogens. Seroprevalence data indicate tens of millions infections yearly and an estimated 1.4 million clinical cases occur yearly worldwide which have significant social and economic impact [77] . Improved sanitation, food safety and vaccination are the most effective ways to prevent hepatitis A virus infection [75] .",

Four major genotypes are discerned and novel lineages of hepatitis E viruses have been identified in rabbits, rats, wild boar, ferrets and possibly foxes more recently [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] . Different genotypes of hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology; genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks while genotype 3 is usually seen in developed countries and rarely causes outbreaks. Hepatitis E virus is transmitted via the faecal-oral route primarily via faecal contamination of water supplies, shellfish and contaminated animal meat, and possibly through zoonosis from pigs. Humanto-human transmission of the virus is rare. Outbreaks and sporadic cases occur worldwide; the virus is most prevalent in East and South Asia and endemic in Asia, Africa and Mexico [85] . An estimated 20 million hepatitis E infections occur worldwide yearly, which are usually self-limited and resolve within 4-6 weeks. Over three million cases of acute fulminant hepatitis E however occur resulting in over 50,000 deaths [4, 86] . Infection with hepatitis E virus is frequent in children in developing countries, but the disease is mostly asymptomatic or causes a very mild illness without jaundice. It causes acute sporadic and epidemic viral hepatitis most commonly in young adults aged 15-40 years with symptoms including jaundice, anorexia, hepatomegaly, abdominal pain and tenderness, nausea, vomiting, and fever that last for up to 2 weeks. A unique disease profile has been observed in pregnant women, where infections with HEV often result in fulminant liver failure, stillbirth and death in 25 % of cases. Treatment and vaccines are unavailable, but currently in development [87] .",

Most astrovirus infections are not severe, self-limited and do not require hospitalization. Disease symptoms can include diarrhoea, followed by nausea, vomiting, fever, malaise and abdominal pain, which last for 3-4 days.

They are divided in at least 12 species containing over 100 (sero)types. Enteroviruses affect millions of people worldwide each year, are spread through the faecal-oral route, and cause a wide variety of symptoms ranging from mild respiratory illness (common cold), hand, foot and mouth disease, acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, aseptic meningitis, myocarditis, severe neonatal sepsis-like disease, and acute flaccid paralysis. Historically, the most prominent member was poliovirus, causing a disabling paralytic illness that has largely been eradicated in most countries through vaccination. Human enterovirus 71 (EV71) epidemics have affected many countries in recent years. Infection commonly causes hand, foot and mouth disease in children, but can result in neurological and cardiorespiratory complications in severe cases. Genotypic changes through inter-and intratypic recombination have been observed, giving rise to serious outbreaks with mortality rate ranging from 10 to 25.7 % [91] . With the emergence of highly pathogenic EV 71 and widespread epidemics, there is great interest in development of an effective EV 71 vaccine and antiviral strategies.

At present, early cluster identification is notoriously difficult as many diseases are not notifiable, diagnostics can be relatively slow and biased for what we know, and clusters are not recognized when patients attend different healthcare facilities. One of the most overlooked but crucial aspects in identifying a potential foodborne related incident is the role that medical practitioners, veterinarians and epidemiologists, in other words the gatekeepers play in recognizing idiopathic disease cases or more than average occurrences of certain disease symptoms [40] . This is not a trivial task as these professionals need to recognize relatively uncommon or completely new infectious diseases, on the basis of changing clinical and epidemiological trends or a \"gut-feeling\", as syndromic surveillance systems targeting non-respiratory disease are sparse. Integrated networks for syndrome surveillance in combination with routine diagnostic surveillance activities for known pathogens in theory would aid in identification of threats which may otherwise fly under the radar. To date, however, no precise and consistent global baseline syndromic surveillance exists, with the exception of the sentinel surveillance system for influenza. Reliable estimates of the global burden of foodborne viruses are important in order to assess their impact, to advise policy-makers on cost-effective interventions [100] , but also to recognize the extraordinary events that signal a potential food-related viral outbreak. The question, however, is how to organise such systems given the ever expanding list of known and potential foodborne viruses.",

Currently, the field is moving towards assays that allow detection of multiple viruses. Multiplex PCR assays allow detection of a number of different viruses in a single reaction (e.g. ID- Tag Generic PCR assays are PCR assays specific for a broader taxonomic range than one virus species (e.g. a whole genus or family of viruses), which allows detection of new virus species within already known viral families [41, 102] . These technolo-gies are aiming to decrease time and effort in demonstrating the presence of a known pathogen in clinical samples, although sometimes at the cost of losing some sensitivity [40, 41] . The limitations of the multiplex or generic PCR assays become readily apparent as multiple different viruses or previously unknown viruses can be present in complex biological samples and continuous updating of the assays is required as viruses, especially RNA viruses, are constantly evolving. In addition, in a diagnostic setting discrimination between subtypes or genera of viruses requires additional labour-intensive procedures based on partial genome characterization as is currently done for example for noroviruses, hepatitis A viruses and enteroviruses, for final diagnosis.",

While these systems target individual pathogens, viral metagenomics tools are a potential candidate to respond to the challenge of obtaining epidemiological estimates on the global disease burden and associated health-related costs of a whole range of (potential) foodborne viruses.

The detection is facilitated by enriching for viruses using filtration and nuclease treatments to remove bacterial and human nucleic acids whereas viral nucleic acid is retained through protection by the viral capsids and/or membrane envelopes. In contrast to classical molecular detection techniques that identify a single virus species or virus family, viral metagenomics allows the characterization of numerous known pathogens simultaneously and also novel pathogens that elude conventional testing. This approach has already resulted in the identification of a plethora of previously unknown human and animal viruses, many of which have been found in diarrhoea specimens [36-43, 78, 82, 102, 107] . It may approach sensitivity of routine diagnostic real time PCR assays used classically for virus diagnosis [108] [109] [110] with the added value of virus type information becoming available simultaneously. In addition, the cost of next-generation sequencing is dropping steadily and steeply each year outpacing Moore's Law. Although computational resources required for analysis of the vast amount of data are often not included in the calculations, the overall costs will likely be able to compete with conventional viral diagnostic molecular methods in the not so distant future in terms of cost and sensitivity, although not yet in speed.",

            "text": "At present, viral metagenomics is mostly used in hindsight to obtain whole viral genome sequences for tracking-and-tracing purposes and to obtain epidemiological information after the virus was identified by more standard molecular assays. In epidemiology, identifying pathways of infectious disease transmission allows amongst others quantification of incubation periods, heterogeneity in transmission rates, and duration of infectiousness, which are important parameters to identify potential points of control and predict future spread of viruses. However, foodborne viral outbreaks are notoriously difficult to recognize, and tracking and tracing potential contacts is logistically challenging and often inconclusive. A variety of data sources can be exploited for attempting to uncover the spatio-temporal dynamics and transmission pathways of a pathogen in a population, by combining disease symptoms, data from contact tracing, results of diagnostic tests and, increasingly, pathogen genetic sequences [113, 114] . Identification of related nucleotide sequences of viruses in patients, also referred to as cluster detection, is an important tool in outbreak investigations in modern day public health and clinical laboratories especially in cases that prove difficult to unravel such as diffuse food-borne outbreaks involving several countries [104] . Norovirus genotype profiles have been used for example to estimate the foodborne proportion of norovirus outbreaks, excluding food handlers as a source of contamination [31, 104, 105] . Preferentially, cluster detection-based approaches and epidemiological inferences are done on whole viral genome sequences, as it provides the most detailed view. Next generation sequencing techniques have been used for tracking purposes in hepatitis A virus (HAV) foodborne outbreaks showing that whole HAV genome analysis offers a more complete genetic characterization of HAV strains than short subgenomic regions [115] , although for many viruses partial phylogenetic informative genomic regions can be sufficient for answering the basic tracking-andtracing questions in an outbreak scenario, with the added advantage of being relatively simple allowing local public health laboratories with limited resources to perform the assays [104, 115] .",

Molecular typing plays a crucial role in this system, but relies among others on the willingness of clinicians to refer patients for laboratory diagnostics and of these laboratories to refer isolates to public health laboratories for typing. The changing clinical practice, with rapid transition from culture-based methods to molecular detection, challenges this decade-old model of disease surveillance [125] . In addition, these surveillance systems are less suited to capture the \"new generation\" of outbreaks, related with the global food market, as illustrated by recent examples of international diffuse foodborne outbreaks showing the vulnerability of the European population and industry for novel food-borne diseases [25, 106, 126, 127] . The currently used microbiological control criteria are not suitable for monitoring of presence or absence of emerging disease risks, and recent studies have shown vast underestimation of levels of contamination for many human pathogens, but also raise questions about the interpretation of molecular detection data in relation to consumer risk [128, 129] .",

Resources for foodborne diseases have been directed mainly to well-known foodborne pathogens and monitoring in the food chain has been implemented based on a farm-to-fork approach [25] by encouraging improvement of hygiene measures and incorporating Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) principles that identify potential contamination hazards and focus on subsequent control and prevention. The latter requires methods for detection of foodborne pathogens and evidence of their disease association. Most of the microbiological quality control criteria on a global scale rely on standard counts of coliform bacteria as a measure of faecal contamination. Needless to say that these criteria are inadequate for protection against foodborne viruses. Viral metagenomics would theoretically be an option to obtain information regarding viral presence in food. However, microbiological testing of food in general has some limitations as a control option. These are constraints of time, as results are not available until several days after testing as well as difficulties related to sampling as small food samples may not be representative for entire lots, analytical methods and the use of indicator organisms and reference standards. Therefore, it has been argued that there are no practical systems for providing safety or assurance of safety by microbiological end-product testing and viral metagenomics approaches would not change the existing pitfalls.",

With the continuing globalization of the food market and changing trends in eating habits [25] , it is unsurprising that the general public is faced with an increasing rate of \"food safety scares\". In order to turn the tide, a huge global effort in virus syndrome and diagnostic surveillance is required, which is justified in the light of global health impact in general, and timely with the development of new metagenomics tools that hold the promise of not only identifying viral pathogens, but possibly the complete microbiome in a single assay. This does not apply to foodborne viral diseases alone. The interrelatedness of animal and human health with global interconnectedness in the twenty-first century is drawing all health related issues together as never before [33] . The combination of sustained pathogen surveillance in animals, humans, plants, environment and food alike with next generation sequencing approaches and a standardized global analytical framework with associated clinical and epidemiological data would provide insight into pathogen incidence, level of co-infections and their correlation to clinical disease instead of focusing on one or a few pathogens as is classically done (Fig. 9.3 ). This information is crucial in deciding which pathogens provide the most substantial health risk, for evidence-based risk assessments for policy development and to implement preventive measures. ",
