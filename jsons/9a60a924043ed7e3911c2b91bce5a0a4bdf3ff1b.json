Interestingly, Payne and colleagues performed a meta-analytic study on reports about the microbiology of ABRS, which evaluated the most common bacterial occurrence within the sinus. The report showed that the maxillary sinus contained H. influenza, S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis, and S. aureus at 28%, 26%, 6%, and 8%, respectively. On the other hand, the same bacteria were found at 34%, 29%, 11%, and 14%, respectively, in the middle meatus [4] . Furthermore, Brook and Gober [7] showed that S. pneumoniae decreased from 44 to 27%, while H. influenza, S. pyrogenes, and S. aureus increased from 37 to 44%, from 7 to 12%, and from 4 to 8%, respectively, with no change in M. catarrhalis (from 13 to 14%). These findings were determined from nasopharyngeal cultures taken from children before and after administration of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.",

Also, the resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, clindamycin, macrolide, and doxycycline was more common in with the bacteria with intermediate penicillin resistance. H. influenzae may be encapsulated or unencapsulated. The type B form was a marginal contributor to meningitis before the incorporation of the vaccine. Unencapsulated strains contribute to 22-35% of ABRS in adults. One of the biggest contributors to antimicrobial resistance is the beta-lactamase production in the organism.

They studied 701 bacterial cultures among 392 isolates. S. aureus was the most common organism (19.0%) isolated. Antibiotic resistance increased dramatically for erythromycin in the study (69.7% in 2005, p = 0.009), and remained unchanged or trended downward for other antibiotics used (p = 0.366 to p = 0.397201 or p = 0.180 and p = 0.120). Nineteen percent of S. aureus bacteria were found to be MRSA. However, MRSA-specific antibiotic resistance rates were not changed over the study (all p \u2265 0.222). The MRSA bacteria showed a statistical and significant increase in the rate of resistance for each antibiotic tested compared to non-MRSA.
