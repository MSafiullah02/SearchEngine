Maintenance of good health status of animals by effective control and treatment of diseases lies in the access to various standard diagnostic tests which are rapid, reliable, precise and highly sensitive and therefore helps in confirming early detection of causative agent. The conventional diagnostic methods are too much demanding in terms of time and labour. Latest advances in the molecular biology and biotechnology have opened new avenues in disease diagnosis and therapeutics, but these technologies are in budding stage so need to be further explored to their full potential to safeguard the health of human in addition to their companion animals. Along with this there is a need to build up qualified, trained and competent manpower for bringing the existing disease diagnostic methods in laboratories to field of action. Because of the lack of skilled manpower in different institutions of public undertakings, it is highly desirable that the gained expertise and knowledge be disseminated to users of these techniques directly so benefits can be harnessed more efficiently and effectively.",

It is a faster technique than other methods of detection of pathogens (bacteria, fungi or viruses), which require initial isolation in culture. PCR has been used in veterinary diagnostics for specific genomic detection, e.g. infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus, foot-and-mouth disease virus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus, buffalopox virus, ephemeral fever virus and many others.

A copy of DNA is made from RNA, and then transcription produces million copies of RNA. The variations of TAS are transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), nucleic acid sequencebased amplification (NASBA) and self-sustaining sequence replication (3SR). In the process, the primer complementary to the sequences that has the binding site for RNA polymerase is added to the targeted RNA molecule. Three enzymes, reverse transcriptase (RT), RNase H and T7 DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, are used in the amplification reaction. The primer anneals and then RT enzyme is used to produce cDNA copy of target RNA. RNase H then degrades the initial RNA from DNA-RNA hybrid. The second primer set binds to newly synthesized cDNA which is extended to produce double-stranded cDNA. Both the strands of this ds cDNA can act as a template for RNA polymerase for transcription. TAS has few advantages over various amplification processes: (1) TAS is an isothermal process, negating the requirement of thermal cycling to drive reactions due to which it helps to minimize contamination risks (Guatelli et al. 1990 ). Apart from direct detection of RNA-containing viruses, e.g. hepatitis C virus, this technique can be used for detection of low amount of certain bacterial and fungal pathogens (Compton 1991) . The only demerit of TAS is heating step which denatures the enzyme due to which enzyme is needed after every denaturation step.",

These primers recognize six distinct binding sites on target DNA. LAMP uses Bst DNA polymerase having strand displacement activity. Both primers and enzymes work together for LAMP cycling initiation and continuation of DNA synthesis with auto-strand displacement leading to the accumulation of 10 9 copies of target in less than an hour. DNA synthesis is primed by FIP and BIP, in combination with initial strand displacement mediated by the extension of forward and backward outer primers, resulting in the successive formation of a DNA molecule. This DNA molecule is looped out at one end, further by a dumb-bell DNA structure, which is rapidly transformed to a stem-loop structure which is the substrate for the elongation and recycling step of LAMP.",

When target DNA is present, the two adjacent probes are ligated by DNA ligase. If ligated product is absent, that means there is at least a single base-pair change in the target sequence. In the following steps, the ligated products can serve as templates and can be amplified by thermal cycling in an exponential manner (Wiedmann et al. 1994) . In LCR contamination risk and variation in copy number of the plasmid containing the target is a problem (Umesha and Manukumar 2016).",

The latest sequencing methods hold promises in increasing the present knowledge regarding the evolution of pathogenic microorganisms especially with respect to the development of antimicrobial resistance. Expensiveness is always a matter of consideration when any diagnostic assay or kit is developed. At present whole-genome sequencing technologies particularly the next-generation sequencing (NGS) are very costly, but as per the increasing demand and use in different field of scientific research, diagnostics and many others, it can be expected to become cheaper in the future.

Briefly, the procedure involved initial random shearing of genome (may be enzymatic or physical by ultrasonication), followed by ligation of both the ends of each fragmented DNA genome with specific adaptors. These adaptors allowed the DNA molecule capturing on the surface of beads. Now these ligated fragments were amplified (emulsion PCR) and captured in emulsion droplet. Individual bead with amplified fragment arrayed in a well of a fibre-optic slide. The 454 GS followed the same sequencing principle as of most primitive Sanger sequencing method.

The labelled or modified nucleotides and optical instruments are not employed as done in other sequencing methods. This system also has various limitations like difficult enumeration of long homopolymer repeats. Signals obtained from high repeats of different nucleotides create obstacles as differentiation could not be made from that of similar but different number homopolymer repeats.

Various methods in proteomics, viz. 2-D gel electrophoresis (2DGE), MALDI-TOF/MS, etc., play a significant role in the analysis of novel proteins and in disease diagnosis. The expression of proteins depends on the status of the body and different environmental factors. This field of study has an important role in novel drug discovery and in the early-stage disease diagnosis (OIE 2016) . Proteome maps are being derived from a range of veterinary pathogens (Mujer et al. 2002; Rout and Field 2001; Yatsuda et al. 2003) . Proteomics-based diagnosis may be used to identify known or unknown disease markers in the future. Proteomics may have applications in the diagnosis of disease pattern development in combination with biochip technology, bead technology, mass spectrometry and other separation chromatographic methods. This type of combination of technologies can be useful for identification of pathogens that do not induce predictable serological reactions, i.e. bovine tuberculosis.",
