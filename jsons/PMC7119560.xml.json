Virus identification is less challenging when probing known viral diseases, in particular, those with characteristic clinical signs. However, some viral diseases are not pathognomonic and therefore challenging to diagnose as is the case when unknown or new viruses are involved. Most detection assays are dependent on the availability of antibodies, antigens or sequence information which are often lacking when investigating novel or divergent pathogens.",

In this regard, RNA viruses are of particular concern, as they mutate at a higher rate than DNA viruses and lack proofreading enzymes to prevent errors during RNA replication (Holland et al., 1982). The constant threat of new infectious diseases reiterates the need for rapid and multiplex detection assays such as microarrays, which can probe thousands of viruses simultaneously. In addition, these assays have the potential to detect viruses closely related to known viral pathogens and viral co-infections. Microarrays, however, do not come without challenges.",

The necessary use of sequence independent amplification to process tissues from unknown viral diseases results in co-amplification of host along with viral nucleic acids. This non-specific amplification is also thought to complicate the interpretation of readout values due to cross hybridization. The rRNA may also compete with viral RNA amplification and instigate lower detection sensitivity. Ribosomal RNA depletion methods, such as RiboMinus\u2122 technology (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK), were stated to improve microarray analysis (Gilbert et al., 2010, Kang et al., 2011). In the RiboMinus\u2122 protocol, rRNA molecules are depleted from total RNA using biotin labelled oligonucleotide probes, which hybridize to 18S, 28S, 5.8S and 5S rRNA before being removed with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. The procedure has been found to reduce large rRNA by 80% (Gilbert et al., 2010).",

The 96 hexamers were also shown to reduce rRNA amplification by >90% and to improve sensitivity of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) (De Vries et al., 2011).

Some studies have also looked at optimising sample processing, such as, reducing genomic DNA and optimising hybridization conditions (Han et al., 2006, Kang et al., 2011). Although these steps have improved microarray detection rate significantly, cross hybridization and a comparatively low sensitivity still remain problematic when testing tissue samples. This study therefore compared the application of rRNA depletion or exclusion methods using tissue samples to investigate if either method can improve microarray detection of RNA viruses and simplify microarray analysis in comparison with the standard random priming protocol.",

The mix was heated on a thermocycler at 95 \u00b0C for 3 min and 37 \u00b0C for 30 min before being applied onto the gasket slide. A microarray slide was then lowered onto the gasket slide and secured inside an Agilent hybridization chamber. The chamber was placed into a pre-heated rotating hybridization oven (Agilent Technologies, Cheshire, UK) at 65 \u00b0C and set to rotate at 10 rpm overnight. The slide, whilst attached to the gasket slide, was submerged into room temperature Agilent Oligo aCGH/Chip-on-chip wash buffer 1 (Agilent Technologies, Cheshire, UK) to remove the gasket slide. The microarray slide was then transferred into a fresh jar of the buffer and washed applying a magnetic stirrer for 5 min. The slide was transferred subsequently into pre-warmed 37 \u00b0C buffer 2 and washed for another 1 min before being scanned. The slide was scanned on a microarray Agilent C scanner with 2 micron resolution as instructed by the manufacturer. The output file from the Feature Extraction software of the scanner was analysed using DetectiV software in R (http://www.R-project.org) (Watson et al., 2007), using data from an unrelated experiment to correct for the background noise. Known virus samples were used to compare p-value and/or the average value of normalised signal intensities in microarray data analysis in order to identify the target virus.",

However, no difference in microarray detection was observed compared to the random priming protocol, especially when applied to deplete rRNA from samples with a low viral load. This may be due to the length of nucleic acid handling time and several steps of separations and washes in the RiboMinus\u2122 protocol, causing degradation and poor recovery of viral nucleic acid. Therefore, the protocol may have removed rRNA effectively, but in the meantime affected adversely viral nucleic acid integrity. In addition, RiboMinus\u2122 Technology is comparatively expensive and time consuming, which restricts its application where a high throughput testing is sought. For these reasons, it would be unrealistic to justify implementing RiboMinus\u2122 Technology, unless it was highly effective at improving a test, which we cannot confirm for microarray.

(2011) found that non-ribosomal hexanucleotides had improved the microarrays specificity. However, all the samples used in the evaluation were virus isolates, which often contain a small amount of cellular contamination and therefore cannot represent tissue samples used for microarray analysis in its intended clinical application. In addition, host genomes were only removed prior to nucleic acid extraction for the experiment carried out with non-rRNA oligonucleotides, which may account for the improvement. The script used to run the DetectiV software may also have been a major contributing factor for equal performance of the three protocols seen in this study, especially when analysing cross hybridization. The software employs a script with instructions to subtract florescence data of an unrelated sample from those of an in-test sample. This background adjustment has already minimised the effect of cross hybridization signals and may have contributed to the comparable outcome for the three protocols. The importance of using signal averages in addition to p-values in microarray analysis was also identified, as the detection rate was found to be lower when using the p-value only. This is due to variability in the signal intensity among individual probes and probe numbers representing a virus. The original work describing the DetectiV software (Watson et al., 2007) has relied only on the p values to analyse microarray outputs. Finally, tissue samples from experimental conditions, which harbour a higher load of rRNA, compared to cell culture isolates, may have rendered a lower efficiency for the rRNA exclusion of the 50 hexamers. The short length of hexamers and consequently non-specific binding may also contribute to the findings of this study, therefore longer oligonucleotides, e.g. nonamers may be more applicable.",

Accordingly, the current random amplification and background adjustment protocols are pertinent for the purpose of investigating novel and emerging diseases via microarray analysis whilst the findings also emphasize the importance of selecting the most appropriate samples for analysis. Protocols suggesting improvement for nucleic acid preparation should also include tissue samples on validation if intended for diagnostic purposes.",
