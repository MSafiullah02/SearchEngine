            "text": "Acute liver failure (ALF) (sometimes referred to as fulminant hepatic failure) is a clinical syndrome resulting from rapid loss in hepatocyte function, typically associated with coagulopathy and encephalopathy in patients without pre\u2010existing liver disease. Liver transplantation is the only therapy of proven benefit, but the rapidity of progression and the variable course of ALF limit its use 1. As a result, reproducible experimental animal models resembling the clinical conditions are still needed to test new therapeutic approaches, and ALF presents many challenging opportunities in basic research. Most common models are based on surgical techniques or the use of hepatotoxic drugs and very few satisfactory viral models are available 2. We have developed a viral model of ALF by means of the inoculation of rabbits with the virus of rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHDV), which displays biochemical data, histological characteristics, and clinical features that resemble those in human ALF 3. In rabbits infected with RHDV melatonin inhibits oxidative damage, apoptotic mechanisms and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress 4, 5, 6, 7, which supports its potential therapeutic use in patients with ALF. A number of reports published in the last few years indicate that properties of the indol as a potent antioxidant, modulator of apoptosis and positive regulator of immune functions contribute to melatonin's antiviral actions 8.",

            "text": "Autophagy is a catabolic process involving self\u2010degradation of cellular components via the lysosomal pathway which acts as survival mechanism and can participate in the host response to infection 9, 10. Autophagy is known to participate in both sensing oxidative stress and removing oxidatively damaged proteins and organelles 11, and plays a multifunctional role in host defense, by promoting pathogen clearance and modulating innate and adaptative immune responses 12. The process begins with the engulfment of bulk amounts of cytoplasm by double membrane vesicles, termed autophagosomes, which ultimately fuse with lysosomes, generating an autolysosome in which the constituent is subsequently degraded 13. At the molecular level the nucleation of the autophagosomal membrane is controlled by a molecular complex containing Bcl\u20102\u2010interacting protein (beclin)\u20101, which allows the production of phosphatidylinositol 3\u2010phosphate to occur 14. Conjugation of ubiquitin\u2010like autophagy\u2010related (Atg)12 to Atg5 and formation of a complex with Atg16L1 is required in the elongation of the autophagosome membrane. Autophagosome formation also requires the conversion of cytosolic\u2010associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)\u2010I to the membrane\u2010bound LC3\u2010II form. LC3 then binds to the adaptator protein p62 sequestrosome 1 (p62/SQSTM1) which, in addition to its role in cell proliferation, inflammation or oxidative stress, facilitates the autophagic degradation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates in lysosomes 13, 15. The interplay between autophagy and programmed cell death is complex, and recent data suggest the existence of a cross talk between autophagic and apoptotic pathways 16. Some studies have demonstrated that autophagy may have an active contribution to cell death in virus infected cells 17. However, there are also reports that autophagy can prolong survival of virus\u2010infected cells by counteracting the apoptotic response 18, 19. Given the well\u2010known regulatory effect that melatonin has on apoptotic cell death, and the dual capabilities of autophagy to induce survival or death depending on cellular stress 20, melatonin modulation of autophagy is currently under consideration 21, and the regulatory role of the indol on the process of autophagy deserves further careful studies.",

Our findings provide evidence that reduction in liver damage by melatonin is associated with a lower RHDV RNA replication and a decrease in the incomplete autophagy induced by RHDV. Further elucidation of the role of autophagy and its relationship to oxidative stress and apoptosis in the pathogenesis of RHDV infection will help to a better knowledge of molecular mechanisms accounting for the protective effect of melatonin in this animal model of ALF.",

Another frequently used autophagy marker is LC3, which is converted from the cytosolic form LC3\u2010I to the lapidated form LC3\u2010II. Western blot data indicate that LC3\u2010II expression increased markedly at 18\u201324 hpi, with a maximum rise of LC3\u2010II/LC3\u2010I ratio at 24 hpi, which suggests that RHDV could be blocking the autophagic process in liver cells at early postinfection periods (Fig. 2A). Effects on LC3 expression can reflect aggregated effects of induced autophagosome synthesis, decreased fusion with lysosomes and/or suppression of proteolytic turnover in the autophagolysosomes. Immunoflourescence analysis showed spots of green fluorescence which reached a maximum at 24 hpi, suggesting an elevated turnover of autophagosomes (Fig. 2B). At 18 hpi, there was little colocalization between LC3 and the lysosomal marker LAMP\u20101, but extensive overlap was observed at 24 hpi, presumably due to increased accumulation of autophagolysosomes. However, the parallel increase in p62/SQSTM1 mRNA levels (Table 2) may reflect a dysfunctional autophagy with impairment of the autophagic flux. The autophagic response in RHDV\u2010infected rabbits was partially inhibited by melatonin treatment, as shown by the reduced LC3 immunofluorescent staining (Fig. 2B), the decrease in LC3\u2010II protein expression (Fig. 2A), and the diminished mRNA expression of beclin\u20101, Atg5, Atg12 and Atg16L1 (Table 2).",

The parallel increase in p62/SQSTM1 expression may reflect a dysfunctional autophagy similar to the previous reports following infection of liver cells by other RNA viruses 28, 29. Data obtained also indicate that the RHDV\u2010induced autophagic response was inhibited by melatonin administration. Mechanisms through which viruses induce autophagy remain unclear. One of the typical stress responses initiated by viral infection is ER stress, which down\u2010regulates protein synthesis through the three branches of the unfolded protein response (UPR). During ER stress, different transcription factors regulate the expression of ER chaperones, such as CHOP and BiP, which enhance the folding capacity of the ER 7. It is known that sensors of the UPR control signal\u2010transduction pathways leading to the transcription of autophagic genes 30, and viruses capable of inducing ER stress have the potential to induce an autophagic response. Thus, previous studies have demonstrated that autophagy is associated to ER stress in HCV infection, and that persistent induction of ER stress and incomplete activation of autophagy play an important role in HCV pathogenesis 28, 31. In addition, a newer hypothesis that is gaining support is that autophagic activities are sensitive to oxidative stress and to the generation of reactive species 11. Indeed, a recent research has shown that oxidative stress triggers the accumulation of autophagic compartments without increasing the degradation of long\u2010lived proteins in human neuroblastoma cells infected by herpes simplex virus type 1 infection 32. Moreover, it has been reported that in MEF cells infected with the Chikungunya virus, independent induction of ER and oxidative stress pathways triggers autophagy through the inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 18. Therefore, the previously reported reduction of oxidative stress and ER stress by melatonin 7, 26, confirmed in this research through the decrease in CHOP and BiP expression and the increase in the GSSG/GSH ratio, could contribute to the inhibitory effect of the indol on the autophagic response induced by viral infection.",

            "text": "In our research, the autophagic activity induced by the RHDV declined in late periods of infection (30\u201336 hpi) in parallel to the increase in apoptosis. Different studies have previously shown that virally induced autophagy is capable of preventing the early apoptotic death of cells 33, which suggests that autophagy might contribute to limit the cytopathic effect of viruses and the pathological consequences associated with cell death triggered by viral infection. This regulation of programmed cell death by autophagy could also be present in RHDV\u2010infected hepatocytes. However, mechanisms responsible for the regulation of apoptosis by autophagy and for the overhelming of the apoptotic response by the inhibitory effect of autophagy remain unknown. Melatonin is able to induce or inhibit autophagy based on cellular necessities and oxidative stress levels. There are reports that autophagy and survival are significantly enhanced in ischemic N2a cells treated with melatonin 34, and melatonin\u2010induced autophagy protects against human prion protein\u2010mediated neurotoxicity 35. Moreover, melatonin induces autophagy and results in the effective removal of mutant\u2010TGFBIp from granular corneal dystroph type 2 fibroblasts 36. In contrast, melatonin is known to protect HeLa cells from rotenone\u2010induced cell injury via inhibition of autophagy 37, to suppress cyclosporine A\u2010induced autophagy in rat pituitary GH3 cells 38, to inhibit kainic acid\u2010induce neurotoxicity in mouse hippocampus via inhibition of autophagy 39, and to attenuate methamphetamine\u2010induced autophagy 40. Consistent with studies which report parallel inhibition of autophagic processes and programmed cell death, in the present experiments both autophagy and apoptosis were significantly inhibited by melatonin. These effects of the indol could be the consequence of its antioxidant action, which may directly antagonize mechanisms contributing both to the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis 6, but also result in the inhibition of ER stress and, in turn, in diminished autophagic and apoptotic responses.",

            "text": "An additional interesting fact concerns the inhibition of RHDV induced by melatonin. The role of autophagy in relation to viral replication is dual and it may be beneficial to virus or host. Thus, although autophagy may be a cellular mechanism to clear viral infection, and its inhibition results in an increased replication and virulence of herpex simplex virus 1 (HSV1) or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), different viruses appear to use this response to enhance their own replication. It has been reported that the double membrane of the autophagosome supports poliovirus replication 41, the autophagic machinery is used for coronaviruses replication 42, HCV uses autophagy for the early protein translation 43, and Dengue virus activate autophagy to elevate viral replication 44. Moreover, it is known that ER stress may play a positive role in HCV RNA replication through activation of autophagy, because siRNAs directed against sensors of the different branches of the UPR suppress HCV\u2010induced lipidation of LC3, required for formation of autophagosomes, and reduce HCV RNA levels 28. It has also been reported that inhibitors of X\u2010box binding protein\u20101 (XBP\u20101), one of the ER stress mediators, inhibit in parallel HCV viral replication and autophagy in hepatoma cells 45. Therefore, data obtained in this study could indicate that the decrease in RHDV RNA replication in melatonin\u2010treated rabbits is a consequence, at least in part, of its negative effect on ER stress and on the autophagic response. Both HCV and Dengue virus are known to exploit the UPR\u2010autophagy pathway to promote replication by suppressing innate antiviral immunity 46, 47, and a number of in vitro and in vivo studies have documented that melatonin plays a role in innate immunity 48. However, in our experiments expression of the phosphorylated form of IRF7, a potent type I interferon inducer capable of modulating viral propagation in infected hepatocytes 49, increased in RHDV\u2010infected rabbits and was not modified by melatonin. This suggests that RHDV is not able to abrogate type I interferon\u2010dependent immune responses, and inhibition of viral replication by melatonin is probably unrelated to induction of innate immunity.",
