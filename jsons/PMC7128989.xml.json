In these situations, the measurement of FCoV antibodies can be more useful than the detection of the virus itself, in that a single serum sample with an antibody titre less than 1:10 indicates that a cat is unlikely to be shedding the virus (Addie and Jarrett, 2001). In contrast it requires five consecutive monthly reverse transciptase polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2013PCR) tests on faeces to demonstrate that a cat is no longer shedding FCoV (Addie and Jarrett, 2001).",

These kits contain combs of test strips: each test strip has three reaction areas: a positive control, a negative control and the test area (see Fig. 1\n). The kits were stored in a refrigerator at 4 \u00b0C, as per the manufacturer's instructions. Five kits used were from one batch and 5 kits were from a second batch. The kits were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The kits were brought to room temperature before use. The samples to be tested were thawed to room temperature. Five microlitres of sample were added to each sample well, and the test was run as per the manufacturer's instructions. The comb was dipped in a series of wells for specific lengths of time, and agitated vertically every 2 minutes. When the reaction was completed the comb was allowed to dry before being read by comparison with a colour scale supplied with each kit (Fig. 2\n). A reading of 1 to 6 was obtained by comparing the shade of grey of the dot with that of the card. As this is a subjective assessment, two independent readers were used. The positive control dot was aligned with the reading of 3, so that readings of 3 or over were considered positive, readings of 2.5 or less were considered negative. The manufacturers classification of \u2018low positive\u2019 for values greater than 0 but less than 2.5 was not used as early experiences with the kit had suggested that these were usually negative on IFA. Dots that appeared darker than level 6 were counted as 6.",

The value will vary according to the prevalence of FCoV in the practice and the intended use of the kit. The most useful application of this test is likely to be in the screening of cats before entry into FCoV-free households. As the false negative cats had low IFA titres and these are associated with a relatively low prevalence of virus shedding it therefore follows that the false negative results are less of a problem. We would not recommend putting an Immunocomb positive cat into a FCoV-free household as there is approximately a 33% risk that he or she will be excreting virus (Addie and Jarrett, 2001). The Immunocomb only missed 4 of 81 seropositive samples. Thus the Immunocomb is an adequate screening test for testing cats for entry into FCoV free households.",
