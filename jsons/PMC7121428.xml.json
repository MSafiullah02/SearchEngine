Chest radiographs obtained on admission showed an infiltrate in the upper lobe of the left lung (Figure 1A). On January 25, he received supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 5 liters per minute because of increasing dyspnea with hypoxemia. The partial pressure of oxygen was 57.2 mm Hg while he was breathing ambient air, and a progressive infiltrate and consolidation were observed on chest radiographs (Figure 1B through 1D). His fever disappeared on January 25, and his clinical condition has improved since January 26. His wife had no symptoms of illness while they were traveling. She was healthy as of January 28.",

He had not traveled to a region where 2019-nCoV was spreading, and he had not had any known contact with any person returning from such a region. On January 17, he met his father in Nha Trang in central Vietnam and shared a bedroom with his parents for 3 days in a hotel room that had an air conditioner. On January 20, a dry cough and fever developed in the son. He also reported having had vomiting and loose stools one time before the admission. This suggests that the incubation period for 2019-nCoV may have been 3 days or less in this case. When the son presented at Cho Ray Hospital with his father on January 22, his illness, characterized by a fever (39\u00b0C), was recognized and he was immediately isolated. Chest radiographs and other laboratory examinations in this patient showed no abnormalities except for an increased level of C-reactive protein (13.9 mg per liter). Real-time RT-PCR assays for influenza A and B viruses and nonstructural protein 1 antigen rapid tests for dengue viruses were negative in both the father and son. A throat swab in the son was positive for 2019-nCoV. His father was thought to be the source of infection. However, sequencing of strains from the two patients to ascertain the transmission of 2019-nCoV from the father to son has not been performed. The son\u2019s condition was stable after January 23.",
