A variety of pathogens might be present in the starting material, which requires a downstream process capable of broad viral reduction. In this article, we used a wide panel of viruses to assess viral removal/inactivation of our downstream process for Snake Antivenom Immunoglobulin (SAI). First, we screened and excluded equine plasma that cross-reacted with any model virus, a procedure not published before for antivenoms. In addition, we evaluated for the first time the virucidal capacity of phenol applied to SAI products. Among the steps analyzed in the process, phenol addition was the most effective one, followed by heat, caprylic acid, and pepsin. All viruses were fully inactivated only by phenol treatment; heat, the second most effective step, did not inactivate the rotavirus and the adenovirus used. We therefore present a SAI downstream method that is cost-effective and eliminates viruses to the extent required by WHO for a safe product.",

            "text": "Humankind has suffered from poisoning because of animal bites since the beginning of times. Currently, snakebites represent the main cause of human envenoming, with approximately 1,841,000 occurrences and 94,000 deaths yearly. Most of the occurrences happen in Asia, Latin America, and especially in Africa. 1 Snake Antivenom Immunoglobulins (SAI) may prevent the referred morbidity and mortality if the correct antidote is administered immediately after the bite. These conditions, however, are impracticable for most regions in need and for some species of snake. 1, 2 The World Health Organization (WHO) endorsed the relevance of SAI for global health by including them in the \"Model Lists of Essential Medicines.\" 3 All biological health products require a rigorous quality control, including SAI. The WHO recently compiled the quality parameters for this centenary product in \"WHO Guidelines for the Production, Control and Regulation of Snake Antivenom Immunoglobulins.\" The document emphasizes that viral content is an essential control parameter because contaminated SAI may infect humans and lead to morbidity or even mortality. Indeed, contaminated humanderived immunoglobulin led to several cases of human infections with hepatitis C virus. 4 The phenomenon is so far unreported for animal-derived immunoglobulins. 5, 6 SAI are purified from hyperimmunized plasma of animals, mainly horses, immunized with a pre-determined amount of crude venom from one or more snake species. 2, 7 Ideally, the donor animals should be free of viral pathogens, 8 but this approach fails because of the incomplete understanding of the equine virology and consequent lack of vaccines. 9 Therefore, to compensate for this flaw, viral inactivation becomes essential in the downstream process of equine plasma.",

Without selection, neutralizing antibodies may interfere in the measurement of virus titers, 13 an essential parameter to evaluate the capability of virus removal/inactivation of the steps alone. Whenever a whole process fails to complete viral inactivation, modifications like further steps might improve the outcome. Some preservatives inactivate viruses cost-effectively, representing a plausible alternative to eliminate viral activity.

Yamamoto and colleagues inactivated more logs of CAV-1 with increased pepsin concentration and extensive reaction times, up to 4 h. 46 However, these increments can cause loss of activity, as discussed before. In another paper, Petr and Jiran completely inactivated CAV-1 in serum-free medium, pH 7.2, after heat inactivation. 47 This increased sensibility to heat probably results from the pH used because CAV-1 is particularly unstable at neutral pH range. 48 Caprylic and pepsin treatments are generally considered unsuitable for inactivation of nonenveloped viruses. 36 Again, we found an exception to an established trend because the nonenveloped CPV was substantially inactivated after the referred treatments (6-4 log). We could not find papers using canine parvovirus for validation of the referred treatments in crude plasma samples. We will avoid performance comparison with other parvoviruses or different initial products because of high variability found among the parvovirus group. 36, 49, 50 Nevertheless, CPV seems to be quite vulnerable to acidic pH, the same condition maintained in our pepsin step. 51 In order to guarantee the \"worst-case scenario\" for parvovirus inactivation, one would have to test different parvoviruses in the same conditions as we tested CPV.",

Its efficacy against bacteria has been extensively studied, but reports approaching phenol as virucidal are scarce in the literature. Addition of phenol to the concentrated bulk resulted in inactivation of all model viruses after just 30 min of exposure, evidenced by undetected values of TCID 50%. A partial or total inactivation was expected for HBV-1, CV, VSV, BVDB, and CDV, because phenolic compounds were described as efficient virucidal agents of enveloped viruses. However, inactivation by phenol of nonenveloped viruses differs with the virus species studied. 52 Some model viruses used in this work are also models for human viruses. For instance, BVDV is used as a surrogate model of hepatitis C virus 53 and CPV as a model of human parvovirus B19. 54 These viruses are important agents of viral infection through human blood products and, consequently, targets for viral inactivation. 52, 55 Phenol inactivated both viruses, which indicates that it might also be an effective preservative for human-derived immunoglobulins, when it comes to viral safety.",
