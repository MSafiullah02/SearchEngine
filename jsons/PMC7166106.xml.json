At the end of January, confirmed cases were concentrated in China (>7000), and in other countries there were only a few imported cases introduced through air travel (>70). However, in February several community outbreaks occurred in countries other than China, such as South Korea, Italy, Germany and Spain (ECDC, 2020a). On April 6, 2020, three months later, 1,244,421 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported, including 68,976 deaths (ECDC, 2020b) with 49,71% of the cases (618,603) and 70,54% of the deaths (48,658) coming from Europe ECDC, 2020b. As of April 6, with 130,759 confirmed cases (10.51% of the world's total number of cases) and 12,418 deaths (18.00% of the world's total of deaths), Spain has become the country with the second-highest number of deaths (after Italy) and number of cases (after United States) (ECDC, 2020b).",

First, the SARS-CoV-2 has a much higher transmissibility, the reproduction number, R0 (number of cases directly generated by one case) is estimated to be between 2.2 and 2.68 (Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team, 2020), while in the seasonal influenza virus R0 is equal to 1.3 and 1.5 in the H1N1 influenza (SARS had an R0 between 2 and 3 while the MERS R0 is <1). See, for instance, Fig. 1\nwhere it is observed that COVID-19 infections grow at much faster rate than seasonal influenza infections do. Second, the incidence in children is much lower. The mean age of patients with COVID-19 was 47 years (Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team, 2020), while that of influenza was 23.4 years (that of SARS was 39.9, while the median age of patients with MERS was 50 years). Third, the average incubation period for the SARS-CoV-2 is 4 days, with a range between 2 and 7 days (Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team, 2020), whereas the virus of the seasonal influenza virus has an average incubation period of 2 days and a range between 1 and 7 days (in SARS the average incubation period was 4.6 days, ranging between 2 and 14 days and in MERS 5.2 days, ranging between 2 and 13 days). Finally, the mortality rate is also much higher (2.3% in COVID-19 vs. 0.13% in seasonal influenza and 0.20% in H1N1 influenza) (Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team, 2020), although this rate should be interpreted with caution, since there is a significant underreporting of registered cases (ECDC, 2020a).",

After the cases skyrocketed, showing that it was no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, the governments of many countries launched mitigation and suppression strategies. Only China opted for a suppression strategy, one which aimed to reverse the epidemic by reducing the basic reproduction number to <1. On January 23 (just a day after the epidemic outbreak started its exponential growth), China took drastic actions, such as severe confinement involving quarantine measures affecting 60 million people, and strict limitations to travel. Other countries, however, have opted for a mitigation strategy, trying to slow but not stop the spread of the epidemic (flattening the epidemic curve, i.e. decreasing the peak of the epidemic). By slowing down the spread of the epidemic, the aim is to mitigate its effects on the health care system and on the social perception of the epidemic. South Korea introduced mass screening, localized quarantines, and a national mobile phone alert system to warn residents in districts or localities of the movements of affected individuals to detect possible outbreaks. Most countries have opted, to varying degrees, for physical distancing (also known as social distancing), which attempts to minimize close contact between people and thus slow down the spread of the epidemic. Physical distancing measures taken by governments include quarantines, travel restrictions, and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, cinemas, theatres and restaurants. Furthermore, people themselves, either following the advice of their governments or obligatorily doing so to avoid fines, have adopted physical distancing methods by staying home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using non-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others. Italy adopted these measures on March 7 in Lombardy and 11 other nearby provinces, and then in the rest of the country on March 12 (13 and 18 days after the epidemic outbreak started its exponential growth). Meanwhile, in Spain the measures were adopted for the whole country on March 14 (13 days after the epidemic outbreak started its exponential growth).",

Thus, the epidemic curve of new cases is not comparable between countries, since there is great variability in the diagnosis of the disease. For example, in Spain the diagnostic protocol established that routine diagnostic tests for coronaviruses should not be carried out on contacts, thus leaving mild and asymptomatic cases untested. However, in South Korea, performing as many tests as possible has been shown to be the key tool in curbing the virus. Nevertheless, the epidemic curve of the accumulated cases shows striking similarity between countries, especially once they are put on the same scale, defining day 0 as the outbreak of the epidemic (see Figs. 2\n). The shape of this curve can be estimated by the rate of variation of the represented variable.",

Thus, first, looking at Fig. 2a, it seems that the strategy adopted by South Korea has been the most effective, since it has managed to flatten the curve before any other country (between 10 and 15 days after the outbreak). In this same sense, we find that the curves that are most similar to Spain (still growing exponentially, i.e. with a reproductive number greater than one) are those of Italy and China in their first month of evolution (since the outbreak). As for whether confinement in Spain is not sufficient to flatten the curve and should therefore be tightened, our results seem to contradict it. We predict that the rate of change of cumulative cases will be zero (that is, the epidemic curve will flatten) in early April.",
