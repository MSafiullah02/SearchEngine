            "text": "Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals such as cattle, swine, and sheep (Pereira, 1981). The ability of the FMD virus (FMDV) to spread rapidly in susceptible animals has led to FMD being considered a disease serious enough to be listed by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). FMDV belongs to the genus Aphthovirus in the family Picornaviridae (Bachrach, 1968). The virus genome is an 8.5-kb, positive-sense single-stranded RNA containing one open reading frame. There are 7 serotypes: A, O, Asia1, C, SAT1, SAT2, and SAT3; moreover, numerous subtypes have evolved within each serotype (Knowles and Samuel, 2003; Domingo et al., 2003). The use of current FMD vaccines to induce early protection is limited because protection cannot take effect until 7 days after the vaccination (Golde et al., 2005). Therefore, an alternative method of applying antiviral agents is required to reduce the spread of FMDV in outbreak situations. Guanidine-hydrochloride (guanidine-HCl), ribavirin, interferon (IFN), and small interference RNA (siRNA) have been proposed as promising antiviral agents with different mechanisms. However, their inhibition effects on FMDV have not been evaluated although they have different antiviral efficiency. Furthermore, treatment with individual antiviral agents does not lead to perfect inhibition because of limitations related to viral resistance.",

            "text": "Ribavirin and guanidine-HCl are known as chemical compounds that inhibit FMDV replication in cells (Airaksinen et al., 2003, Nettleton et al., 1982). Guanidine-HCl inhibits the replication of picornaviruses such as FMDV and poliovirus. Ribavirin has antiviral effects against a broad range of viruses, including FMDV, by inhibition of RNA-capping activity or viral polymerase, and by increasing mutation frequency (Graci and Cameron, 2006). A broad-spectrum anti-metabolite, 6-azauridine inhibits virus replication (Rada and Dragun, 1977). It has been reported that 6-azauridine effectively inhibits RNA viruses such as Chikungunya virus, Semliki Forest virus, and human coronavirus at low concentration (Briolant et al., 2004, Pyrc et al., 2006). However, it has not been reported whether 6-azauridine effectively inhibits FMDV. Recombinant adenovirus expressing porcine IFN-\u03b1 induces high levels of biologically active IFN in cell supernatants and has antiviral effects against FMDV in cells, and the protection lasts for 3\u20135 days in swine inoculated with the adenovirus (Chinsangaram et al., 2003). RNA interference (RNAi), which causes gene silencing in a sequence-specific manner, is mediated by short hairpin RNA. Recently, researchers reported the inhibition of FMDV replication using plasmids or adenovirus expressing RNAi (Chen et al., 2006, Chen et al., 2004, Kahana et al., 2004). We have reported significant antiviral effects against FMDV by adenovirus expressing multiple siRNA targeting non-structural protein genes (Kim et al., 2010). The multiple siRNA enhanced antiviral efficiency and had antiviral effects against 7 FMDV serotypes.",

Our group anticipated that the combination treatment of antiviral agents with different mechanisms might be more advantageous in overcoming their individual limitations. Moreover, FMD researchers have reported that combination treatment such as type I and II IFN, or guanidine-HCl and ribavirin enhanced the antiviral effect (Moraes et al., 2007, Perales et al., 2009).",

            "text": "Several antiviral agents against FMDV such as chemical compounds, IFN, and siRNA have been proposed as an alternative method of FMD prevention (Airaksinen et al., 2003, Nettleton et al., 1982, Chinsangaram et al., 2003, Chen et al., 2006). These antiviral agents have different mechanisms for virus inhibition. Ribavirin is a mutagenic nucleoside analogue that is converted to its triphosphate form by cellular enzymes. Recently, the lethal mutagenesis of FMDV by ribavirin was analyzed on a molecular basis (Ehrenfeld et al., 2010, Perales et al., 2011). The study reported that ribavirin leads to lethal mutagenesis by accelerating the occurrence of AU-rich mutant clouds during the early replication stage, and not by increasing viral mutation rate. Guanidine-HCl blocks the ATPase activity of nonstructural protein 2C, a protein involved in poliovirus replication (Saunders et al., 1985). Type I IFNs, IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2, lead to the expression of genes that have antiviral activity (Der et al., 1998). Researchers have reported that treatment with IFN-\u03b1 inhibited FMDV in cells, and the process is involved with IFN \u03b1/\u03b2-stimulated genes (ISGs), 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) and double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) (Chinsangaram et al., 2001, Chinsangaram et al., 1999). Gene silencing is caused by siRNA in a sequence-specific manner and leads to the inhibition of virus replication. Our group has reported that adenovirus expressing three different siRNAs targeting non-structural protein genes in the 2B or 3C regions possess enhanced and broad antiviral effects against FMDV (Kim et al., 2010).",

FMDV induces amino acid mutation of the 3D region to decrease sensitivity to ribavirin, and the FMDV leader sequence negatively regulates type I IFN (Agudo et al., 2010, de Los Santos et al., 2006, Ferrer-Orta et al., 2010, Sierra et al., 2007, Wang et al., 2011). Amino acid substitutions at non-structural protein 2C have been associated with resistance to guanidine-HCl in FMDV (Belsham and Normann, 2008, Pfister and Wimmer, 1999, Saunders et al., 1985). Additionally, siRNA loses its effect due to escape mutants of the virus (Sabariegos et al., 2006). Therefore, we anticipated that combination treatment using antiviral agents with different inhibition mechanisms would be more effective at circumventing FMDV resistance. Combination antiviral therapy has become standard for some human disease viruses, for example, the human immunodeficiency virus and human hepatitis C virus (Bhagani, 2011).",

The combination of Ad-porcine IFN-\u03b1 with 6-azauridine did not demonstrate as much enhanced antiviral effect as the individual Ad-porcine IFN-\u03b1 or 6-azauridine treatments did.

            "text": "The combination of 100 TCID50 Ad-porcine IFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin, except at high concentration (500 \u03bcM ribavirin), did not lead to an enhanced antiviral effect, whereas the single adenovirus treatment did (Fig. 2B). The reason might be the combination of the high-dose recombinant adenovirus and ribavirin. The combination of ribavirin and human IFN-\u03b1 protein is a common treatment method for human hepatitis C (Bhagani, 2011). Therefore, we suggest that ribavirin might interfere with the expression of porcine IFN-\u03b1 in the recombinant adenovirus, or a part of ribavirin might inhibit the adenovirus. A previous study reported that ribavirin had antiviral effects on adenoviruses (Lenaerts and Naesens, 2006). However, the mechanism of ribavirin against adenovirus and its antiviral effect on recombinant adenovirus is not clear because several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the antiviral activity. Due to this possibility, we compared the simultaneous inoculation of Ad-porcine IFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin, and sequential inoculation, where ribavirin treatment followed adsorption of Ad-porcine IFN-\u03b1 (Fig. 4). The sequential inoculation of Ad-porcine IFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin at 24 and 6 h, respectively, before FMDV infection was more effective than their simultaneous inoculation. The result was consistent with the results of Perales et al. (Perales et al., 2009). Sequential treatment with ribavirin and guanidine-HCl was more effective than the simultaneous combination treatment. Therefore, we carried out the sequential or simultaneous injection of Ad-porcine IFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin in suckling mice to expand the examination to animals (Fig. 5A and 5C).",

We demonstrated that the mixture of Ad-porcine IFN-\u03b1 and Ad-siRNA or ribavirin had a positive effect on FMDV inhibition, and that the effect of 1 antiviral did not interfere with that of the other in vivo. The survival rate of Ad-siRNA was higher than that of Ad-porcine IFN-\u03b1 in the same titer in 125 LD50 and 250 LD50, although the selectivity index of Ad-porcine IFN-\u03b1 in IBRS-2 cells was 10-fold higher than that of Ad-siRNA (Table 1). One possible reason is that the inhibition effect of multiple siRNA was higher than that of porcine IFN-\u03b1. Another possible reason is that the inhibition effect of Ad-porcine IFN-\u03b1 was enhanced by the stimulation of IFN pathway-related genes in porcine kidney cells (Chinsangaram et al., 2003, Chinsangaram et al., 1999), and that the gene stimulation might not have taken place because the suckling mice model lacks IFN responses (Ryman et al., 2000). The survival rate of combination group 1, treated with Ad-porcine IFN-\u03b1 and Ad-siRNA, was lower than that treated with Ad-siRNA alone, while that of combination group 2, treated with a mixture of single-dose Ad-porcine IFN-\u03b1 and Ad-siRNA, was higher than that of single-dose Ad-siRNA. A possible explanation for this result could be that the antiviral effect is proportional to adenovirus titer, and the survival rate of the Ad-siRNA-treated group was higher than that of the group treated with Ad-porcine IFN-\u03b1 in the same titer.",

            "text": "We anticipated that combination treatment using Ad-porcine IFN-\u03b1, Ad-siRNA, or ribavirin would have advantages for FMDV control. The first of these advantages is that the combination treatment could lead to more rapid and effective inhibition of FMDV because antiviral agents have different activation times. We investigated how quickly the antiviral effects of Ad-porcine IFN-\u03b1, Ad-siRNA, or ribavirin were induced in IBRS-2 cells (Fig. 3). We expected Ad-siRNA and Ad-porcine IFN-\u03b1, especially Ad-siRNA, to have greater advantages than ribavirin, and that the addition of Ad-siRNA and Ad-porcine IFN-\u03b1 could induce rapid inhibition when applied to an emergency situation. Second, the combination treatment could maintain the inhibition effect for a longer period because the combination of antiviral agents could be advantageous to circumventing FMDV resistance and the antiviral agents might have varying half-lifes in animals. Furthermore, Ad-porcine IFN-\u03b1 stimulates the genes related to antiviral effects as time progresses after the treatment, and has a direct effect by the porcine IFN-\u03b1 protein (Chinsangaram et al., 2003). Third, we suggest that their combination can reduce the quantities of single agents used to inhibit FMDV. Therefore, we propose that the combination of Ad-porcine IFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin or Ad-porcine IFN-\u03b1 and Ad-siRNA could be effective when used as an emergency or combination agent with vaccines in order to prevent the spread of FMDV. It could be a very promising method if the agent could start to take effect within 24 h and could maintain the antiviral effect until the formation of immunity by vaccination. Further study in a natural host would provide conclusive evidence.",
