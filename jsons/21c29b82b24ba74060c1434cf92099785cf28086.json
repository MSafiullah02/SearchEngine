            "text": "C57BI/6N mice develop a CNS demyelinating disease when inoculated intracranially at 4 weeks of age with the A59 strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-A59). In order to explore the virus-host interactions, the histological features of the demyelinating disease were correlated with the spatial and temporal distribution of viral transcripts and the expression of oligodendrocyte-specific genes (myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, myelin-associated glycoprotein, and 2',3'cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase) in the spinal cord of diseased mice. Three distinct phases in the disease were identified. In the first phase, 1 week postinfection (1 WPI), virus replication was widespread in both gray and white matter but was preferentially occurring in glial cells. In the ventral and dorsal root zones where viral transcripts were most abundant, all myelin gene transcripts were decreased before demyelination was seen. During the second phase of the disease (2-3 WPI), viral transcripts decreased in abundance and became restricted to the white matter. Numerous demyelinating lesions were observed and were characterized by inflammatory cells, paucity of oligodendrocytes, and a profound decrease of all myelin gene transcripts. In the third phase of the disease (4-6 WPI) no viral transcripts were detected, and remyelination began. In the lesions and the tissue surrounding them, transcripts of all myelin genes increased to levels above normal. The increased expression of myelin gene transcripts occurred in a synchronized manner and with a cellular distribution reminiscent of that seen in developmental myelination. These molecular events correlated with efficient remyelination and clinical recovery in this murine demyelinating disease.",

Therefore, demyelination can cause important neurological dysfunction such as that seen in multiple sclerosis of man (reviewed in Silberberg, 1986) . In some demyelinating diseases, myelin can be repaired, and clinical recovery occurs (reviewed in Ludwin, 1981) . This indicates that glial cells involved in the myelination program are capable of reconstructing properly myelinated tracts in the diseased adult nervous system. While many aspects of the cellular and molecular events leading to myelination during development have been elucidated (reviewed in Lemke, 1988;  01989 Alan R. Liss, Inc. Raff and Miller, 1984; Wood and Bunge, 19841 , those underlying myelin repair in the adult CNS are poorly understood. Thus, a detailed analysis of the events during remyelination is needed and may lead to the discovery of methods to enhance myelin repair when it is insufficient.",

            "text": "In small rodents, several experimental demyelinating diseases have been described over the last two decades (reviewed in Ludwin, 1981) . Those diseases that most closely resemble human demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis fall into two groups. In the first group, a variety of myelin components can induce an autoimmune demyelinating disease such as experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (Raine, 1984; Tuohy et al., 1988) . In the second group, different viruses can infect glial cells and cause CNS demyelination. Among the RNA viruses, a mouse picornavirus causes demyelination during Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis (Aubert et al., 1987; Chamorro et al., 1986; Lipton and Dal Canto, 1976) . In this model, virus persists at the sites of the lesions although at low levels, and infected cells appear to survive for prolonged periods of time. In contrast, the JHM and A-59 strains of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) usually cause a n acute glial cell infection (Herndon et al., 1977; Knobler et al., 1981; Lavi et al., 1984a; Sorensen et al., 1981; Stohlman and Weiner, 1981; Woyciechowska et al., 1984) . This infection may result in loss of oligodendrocytes and their myelin sheaths, sometimes with a subsequent autoimmune response to myelin antigens (Watanabe et al., 1983) . Mice infected with theA59 strain ofMHV have an initial acute phase of the disease accompanied by a vigorous immune response, which results in efficient clearing of the virus (Woyciechowska et al., 1984) . Clinical recovery and myelin repair occur in the following 2-8 weeks (Kristensson et al., 1986; Lavi et al., 1984a,b; Woyciechowska et al., 1984) . Although the viral-induced demyelinating lesions closely resemble those seen in multiple sclerosis, no specific association between multiple sclerosis and coronaviruses has been demonstrated so far (Fleming et al., 1988) . We have chosen the MHV-A59 model for our studies since the virus caused demyelination in the spinal cord of a high proportion of the animals; subsequently, myelin repair can be followed closely in these spinal cord regions.",

In the case of MBP, a subset of transcript forms that appear during early development and contain exon 2 genetic information were highly expressed during myelination and sharply decreased thereafter (Jordan et al., 1989) . We also examined MBP expression in the demyelinating animals and found that MBP transcripts were reduced in the lesions compared to the rest of the white matter (Kristensson et al., 1986) .

We then followed the expression of these four myelin gene transcripts during remyelination, using MBP as a reference. Three successive phases were identified in the course of the disease. During the first phase, virus replication was widespread and appeared to reduce myelin gene transcripts below normal levels. In the second phase, demyelinating lesions formed and showed a dramatic loss in myelin gene transcripts while the viral transcripts were progressively cleared. In the third phase, all myelin gene transcripts in and around the lesions increased above normal levels in a synchronized manner while remyelination proceeded.",

Spinal cord white matter from normal mice is characterized by close packing of myelinated axons, with neuroglial cells interspersed between the axons (Fig. IN. Foci of inflammation and demyelination developed within spinal cord white matter 6-10 days after intracranial inoculation with MHV-A59. Although asynchrony from lesion to lesion was observed, most lesions displayed a common pattern of initiation and progression. The earliest lesions, seen 1 and 2 weeks postinfection (WPI), exhibited collections of inflammatory cells within the subarachnoid space and nearby white matter (Fig. lR) , with minimal destruction of myelin. More advanced lesions, 3 WPI or later, showed partial or complete destruction of myelin sheaths, and were populated by debris-filled macrophages and other inflammatory cells (Fig. 10 . Oligodendrocytes, identified by light and electron microscopy, were reduced in number or virtually eliminated within these lesions, while axons remained largely intact. Evidence of CNS remyelination was occasionally seen 3-4 WPI by light microscopy and confirmed by electron microscopy (Figs. lC, 2) . Axons surrounded by a few loose turns of myelin or thin myelin sheaths were detectable after 3 WPI (Fig. 1 C) and later became more common around the lesions where demyelination was well advanced (Fig. 2) . Rernyelination continued as demyelination subsided; by 12 WPI, lesions were well remyelinated (although myelin sheaths were thinner than normal myelin sheaths), and cellular infiltrates had largely cleared from the white matter and subarachnoid space (Fig. 1D) .",

Adjacent sections from the same blocks of tissue were stained for myelin with Sudan black to identify and localize demy-elinated lesions. At 1 WPI, viral transcripts were very abundant both in white matter and gray matter and could clearly be seen in white matter areas, which were still well myelinated (Fig. 3A,E) . The most frequently affected sites and those with the highest abundance of viral transcripts were in the dorsal and ventral root regions (Fig. 3E) , where the first demyelinating lesions often appeared (Fig. 3A) . At 2 WPI, large areas of demyelination were found (Fig. 3B) , again mostly in ventral and dorsal root regions. At that time, viral transcripts were less abundant and were mostly cleared from the gray matter as well as from areas where demyelination was pronounced (compare Fig. 3B and   F ). Viral transcripts persisted only in white matter at 3 WPI (Fig. 3G) , and by 4 WPI, they were either undetect- able or limited to a few small foci (Fig. 3H ) while large demyelinated lesions were seen in almost all sections (Fig. 3D ). Occasionally lesions involved as much as 50% of the white matter. At 12 WPI, viral mRNA was not detected, and myelin appeared normal by Sudan black staining (data not shown) even though remyelinated sheaths were thinner than normal (Fig. 1D) .",

We found that viral expression markedly reduced the levels of myelin gene transcripts at an early stage of the disease prior to demyelination (1 WPI). This reduction of myelin gene transcript levels persisted for several weeks and was associated with the development of histologic signs of demyelination and inflammation. This phase was followed by the coordinated reexpression of these myelin genes in and around the lesions where myelin repair occurred. It appears that in situ hybridization for specific gene transcripts can provide early and sensitive detection of both degenerative and repair processes in the central nervous system.",

MHV-JHM RNA was demonstrated in the CNS of mice inoculated intranasally at 10 days of age (Perlman et al., 1988) . These mice developed a demyelinating encephalomyelitis, and the distribution of viral transcripts suggested viral spread along neuronal pathways and from contiguous structures. In our study, MHV-A59 appeared to replicate mostly in glial cells and not in neurons, even when the virus was present in the gray matter at 1 WPI. Similarly, virus was demonstrated by electron microscopy in oligodendrocytes infected with the JHM strain (Knobler et al., 1981; Powell and Lampert, 1975) . Double-immunolabeling studies also showed MHV-A59 antigen in both oligodendrocytes and astrocytes at 1 WPI (C. Godfraind, unpublished observation) . During the next 2 weeks, virus became restricted to white matter and was progressively cleared. This evolution correlates well with previous studies, which found that virus could not be isolated from the CNS after 2-3 WPI and that viral antigen could not be found in oligodendrocytes after 4 WPI (Lavi et al., 1984b; Woyciechowskaet al., 1984) . However, Lavi et al. (1984a) found occasional positive foci by in situ hybridization in a few animals at 10 months PI, suggesting that infection may sometimes persist and/or recur in older animals.",

This early decrease in the expression of myelin genes was correlated with replication of virus in oligodendrocytes, but without a clear demonstration of reduced oligodendrocyte numbers. Thus active viral replication and a decrease in specific host cell gene expression are the hallmarks of the first phase of this disease. In the second phase of the disease (2-3 WPI), demyelinating lesions formed (in areas commonly supporting viral replication), and a dramatic loss of all myelin gene transcripts was observed in these lesions. The lesions were characterized by inflammatory cell infiltrates, macrophages phagocytosing cellular and myelin debris, and the lack of both Sudan black and MBP staining. In contrast, an increase in GFAP immunoreactivity in the lesions (Fig. 5B) and throughout the spinal cord was observed (Godfraind et al., 1988) . The number of oligodendrocytes in the lesions was greatly reduced, an observation that correlates with the dramatic decrease in myelin gene transcripts and is likely due to virus-induced cell death.",

The earliest sign of myelin repair at the molecular level was an increase in the subset of MBP transcripts containing exon 2 information. This increased expression was limited to scattered oligodendrocytes found in or near demyelinated lesions (Jordan et al., submitted) . These transcripts are most abundant at the onset of myelination in developing animals and are reduced in adult animals when other MBP transcript forms predominate (de Ferra et al., in preparation) (Jordan et al., 1989; Kamholz et al., 1988) . This sequential expression of MBP transcript subsets was also seen in lesions of MHV-infected mice undergoing remyelination (Jordan et al., submitted) . In the present study, we showed that other myelin gene transcripts (MBP, PLP, MAG, and CNP) were also increased in the lesions and in the surrounding tissue and were expressed synchronously as in developmental myelination (Jordan et al., 1989) . This is reminiscent of immunocytochemical observations on the superior cerebellar peduncle of animals demyelinated with cuprizone, where expression of myelin proteins in remyelinating oligodendrocytes appears to revert to that seen during normal development (Ludwin and Sternberger, 1984) . Thus, the coordinated and timely expression of myelin genes observed in vivo and in vitro during development (Dubois-Dalcq et al., 1986; Kanfer et al., 1989; Monge et al., 1986 ; among others) may also be characteristic of remyelination in the adult CNS.",

This observation correlates with evidence that new oligodendrocytes were generated in the spinal cords of these infected animals (Armstrong et al., 1988; Godfraind et al., 1988) .
