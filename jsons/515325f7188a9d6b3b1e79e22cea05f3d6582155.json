Emerging infectious diseases remain an underlying source of global health concern. Guidelines for accident and emergency departments would require adjustments for infectious disease management. However, disparities between guidelines and nurses' practice are frequently reported, which undermines the implementation of these guidelines into practice. This article explores the experience of frontline emergency nurses regarding guideline implementation and provides an in-depth account of their strategies in bridging guideline-practice gaps. Design. A qualitative descriptive design was used. Methods. Semi-structured, face-to-face, individual interviews were conducted between November 2013-May 2014. A purposive sample of 12 frontline emergency nurses from five accident and emergency departments in Hong Kong were recruited. The audio-recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed with a qualitative content analysis approach. Results. Four key categories associated with guideline-practice gaps emerged, including getting work done, adapting to accelerated infection control measures, compromising care standards and resolving competing clinical judgments across collaborating departments. The results illustrate that the guideline-practice gaps could be associated with inadequate provision of corresponding organisational supports after guidelines are established. Conclusions. The nurses' experiences have uncovered the difficulties in the implementation of guidelines in emergency care settings and the corresponding strategies used to address these problems. The nurses' experiences reflect their endeavour in adjusting accordingly and adapting themselves to their circumstances in the face of unfeasible guidelines. Relevance to clinical practice. It is important to customise guidelines to the needs of frontline nurses. Maintaining cross-departmental consensus on guideline interpretation and operation is also indicated as an important component for effective guideline implementation.",

Emergency nurses, in view of the frequency and intensity of close patient contact, are in an ideal position for disease surveillance. Their involvement in infection control and disease prevention can also help to reduce the risk of disease exposure of the wider population in the community (Lam & Hung 2013) . With the increasing prevalence of EIDs, the workflows of AEDs would require adjustments to meet the altered health care demands and targets. Major changes to the practice of emergency nursing care delivery are often incorporated into workflow modifications to enhance disease surveillance and infection control (Blachere et al. 2009 ). With a view to assist emergency nurses to embed these changes into their everyday work, guidelines are formulated and implemented in routine practice. These guidelines can provide recommendations and instructions to inform emergency nurses' judgment regarding logistic arrangements, infection control practices, service standards and cross-departmental collaboration, which are crucial elements in efficient epidemic management (Carter et al. 2014) .",

Nichol et al. (2008) noted that the general compliance of nurses with newly introduced guidelines and protocols was usually low, which might be related to their reluctance to change their usual practice. More specifically, there was a breach in safety procedures and infection control. Mounting evidence shows that adherence to guidelines regarding infection control, such as hand hygiene and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), is seriously inadequate among nurses in a variety of health care settings (Pan et al. 2008 , Efstathiou et al. 2011 . Notwithstanding, studies have mainly emphasised the adherence to safety procedures in infection control; detailed studies investigating compliance to infection control guidelines on the rearrangement of workflow and routine practice are sparse. Also, because most of the investigations to date have studied guideline implementation in general care settings, issues regarding guideline adherence and nurses' practice in infectious disease management in emergency care settings remain poorly understood (Carter et al. 2014) . In seeking to ensure a timely and appropriate response to impending outbreaks, this study was conducted to offer a sound understanding of the unique features of guideline implementation in the course of an epidemic event in an emergency care context.",

Over the course of a semi-structured interview, that is, an interview without a rigid set of close-ended questions for the participants, flexibility is granted to informants to express their perspectives from different dimensions (Robertson & Boyle 1984 , Minichiello et al. 1990 ). Nonetheless, an interview agenda was developed to guide the theme of coverage to maintain a consistency of focus throughout the interviews (Rose 1994 , Briggs 2000 . The participants were allowed to select the venues for the interviews on the premise of privacy and confidentiality. Interviews were conducted in Chinese and began with a general question: 'Please tell me about your experience in upholding the guidelines for management of emerging infectious diseases.' Subsequent open-ended questions were asked by the interviewers according to the interview agenda. Probing questions were asked to clarify statements that were vague or ambiguous (Barriball & While 1994) . All interviews were audio-recorded with the participants' permission. The interviews lasted around an hour.",

The verbatim transcripts were then interpreted manually using inductive content analysis, an approach frequently adopted for qualitative data interpretation (Schreier 2012) . This approach involves identification and refinement of categories inherent in the data and is well-suited to provide a rich and nuanced account of research findings without obscuring data (Thomas 2006) . The analytic procedure was informed by the qualitative content analysis approach, which consists of three phases: open coding, creation of categories and abstraction (Elo & Kyng\u20ac as 2008) . The open coding phase commenced with detailed scrutiny of each interview transcript to familiarise the researchers with their contents. An indexing scheme was initiated by breaking the information down into discrete segments of meaning units. Once the meaning units emerged, they were coded by labelling them with their representative characteristics and relevance regarding the phenomenon of interest.",

(Nurse 6) In addition, the participants revealed the controversy associated with the divergence of understandings regarding admission guidelines between staff from AEDs and staff from general wards. Several participants claimed that staff from other departments had queried and even disputed their judgments regarding whether a patient should be admitted to an isolation ward or to a general ward. A nurse shared his experience with rejection when tried to admit a noncontagious patient on to a general ward: I once had arranged admission for a non-infectious patient who previously had been suspected for infection. Although the patient was confirmed to be clean (non-infectious), the staff from the receiving medical ward had become very sensitive, challenged the admission criteria in our department and refused to receive the patient. . . at last the patient had to be admitted to an isolation ward.

The results illustrate that the guideline-practice gaps can be accounted for by inadequate provision of corresponding administrative and organisational support, in terms of manpower, facilities and policies, after the launch of the guidelines in practice. These findings are consistent with those in the literature that show that transferring guidelines into clinical practice is greatly influenced by the practice environment, including the availability of resources and leadership responsiveness (Graham et al. 2004) . In fact, the perceived impracticality of the guidelines was repeatedly cited by the participants, who highlighted the fundamental shortcomings on administrative leadership in showing responsiveness to the constituent concerns of the environmental constraints in the workplace. These findings are in agreement with those of May et al. (2014) , who reviewed the constituents of implementation of nursing clinical practice guidelines in the literature. Their review summarised the results from the studies of Ploeg et al. (2007) and Yagasaki and Komatsu (2011) , which identified that the adherence of guidelines among nurses could be adversely influenced and the applicability of integrating guidelines was impeded by constraints in clinical settings. The limited applicability of guidelines as reported in the current study could be explained by the top-down planning approach that is commonly adopted in various health care organisations for guideline formulation (Mintzberg 2012) . This top-down approach refers to a strategy of decisionmaking regarding processes that involves the participation only of administrative personnel at the senior level (Meslin 2009 ). Without the participation of frontline personnel, the imposed guidelines and policies often deviate from their expectations and capacities and limit the uptake of guidelines into workflow (Ploeg et al. 2007 ). Therefore, the need for subsequent evaluation of the processes and outcomes regarding guideline implementation are highlighted to examine the feasibility and workability of guidelines in existing situations.",

The participants in this study indicated that time constraints imposed by their excessive workload interfered with their engagement with guidelines such as hand hygiene practices and PPE usage. In accordance with the present results, previous studies have shown that heavy workloads and inadequate staffing could inhibit nurses from implementing new guidelines into practice, inasmuch as the guidelines produced additional work and duties for them (Ploeg et al. 2007 , Lam & Hung 2013 , Matthew-Maich et al. 2013 . In addition to time constraints, facility constraints, particularly regarding respiratory isolation rooms in AEDs, were seen by the participants as another major barrier to successful guideline implementation. Although the importance of spatial separation in controlling respiratory contagion was generally acknowledged by the participants, the difficulties inherent in isolation facility limitations had inhibited them from implementing quarantine measures for suspected patients. This finding is comparable to that of Martel et al. (2013) , in which a low compliance rate of emergency nurses to appropriate patient isolation was identified as a result of the constrained practice environment. Furthermore, it is somewhat surprising to reveal from the present findings that access to emergency care for patients in critical condition could be impeded because resuscitation facilities are occupied for respiratory isolation. Although the dual use of facilities is a seemingly helpful method to enhance the effective use of available resources, particularly in the management of unexpected patient upsurges (Hick et al. 2004) , prudent consideration of facility planning is essential for hospital administrators to prevent affecting the usual standards of health care services. Thus, clinical guidelines should be devised in conjunction with surge planning to enhance patient care surge capacity during the management of large-scale epidemic events.",

Consistent with this finding, much of the current literature on guideline implementation pays particular attention to organisational efforts in coordination and promotion of uptake of practice guidelines among health care personnel (Ploeg et al. 2007 , Farrar & Piot 2014 . In fact, it has been suggested that organisational coordination supports successful implementation not merely in articulating the definitions and standards of the guidelines, but by also creating buy-in for the guidelines by establishing communication between units and departments (Matthew-Maich et al. 2013) . These findings were complemented by the study of Choi et al. (2011) , which noted that managerial support, in terms of effective communication and coordination with subordinates, was of particular importance in promoting nursing practice in chaotic situations, such as infectious disease outbreaks. In the same vein, participants in this study valued assistance from departmental management in conveying their concerns regarding guideline implementation on behalf of the frontline personnel, and they emphasised the importance of effective communication between frontline personnel and the administration in successful guideline implementation. The findings offer needed insight into the administration's role in enhancing guideline implementation by reinforcing intraorganisational and interorganisational coordination.",

In this context, there are similarities between the opinions expressed by the participants in this study and those described by Pretz and Folse (2011) . These authors explained that experienced nurses might have developed a structured knowledge base by accumulation of clinical experience, which helped them adapt to novel situations. As implied in the findings of this study, the participants took into account their clinical experience in responding to the problematic issue of guideline implementation, which suggest the relevance of tacit knowledgethat is, knowledge based upon individual experiences, insights and intuitionsin clinical judgment. Indeed, the decision-making processes of nurses frequently involve the interaction of tacit and explicit knowledge (Kothari et al. 2012) . It became evident throughout the participants' descriptions that the application of tacit and explicit knowledge is one of the most decisive parameters of their adaptive capacity in bridging the guideline-practice gaps for management of an epidemic event. Although there is mounting emphasis in the literature on the adaptive capacity of health care institutions and systems, recent studies have suggested that the individual adaptive capacity of workers at the forefront of health care delivery shows increasing importance to organisational effectiveness in coping with contingencies and changed situations in large-scale health care emergencies (Rumsey et al. 2014) . The findings of this study offer needed insight into strategies to empower the adaptive capacity of frontline emergency nurses in response to public health events. To promote the development of adaptive capacity, strategies to develop and transfer tacit knowledge among emergency nurses should be taken into consideration in formulating measures to enhance their preparedness for imminent EID outbreaks and other large-scale public health emergencies.",

The findings in this study highlight the need to strengthen crossdepartmental communication so as to ensure coherent understanding of terms and instructions and the consistent implementation of guidelines. Other studies have indicated that the dissemination of information over the course of infectious disease outbreaks could be chaotic because information provided by the administrators was excessive and inconsistent (Lam & Hung 2013).

A clinical audit, as incorporated in a number of health care systems, might serve the purpose of quality monitoring. This method has been proposed as an efficient and effective means to assess the quality of practice and promote quality improvement (Pedersen et al. 2014) . However, health care professionals might be unwilling to participate in auditing because they perceive the process as criticising and faultfinding (Bowie et al. 2012) .

In addition, large-scale infectious disease outbreaks commonly lead to numerous negative consequences to the health care system, personnel and resources in an intertwined manner.

Because the focus of this study was issues-related to guideline implementation in response to EIDs, the ideal data collection time would be in the midst of an outbreak.
