            "text": "While the report of biologically inactive carbocyclic thymidine (1) in 19621 introduced a new class of nucleosides, it was the synthesis of racemic carbocyclic adenosine (aristeromycin, 2)2 and subsequent isolation of the (\u2212)-enantiomer from Streptomyces citricolor\n3 that the era of carbocyclic nucleosides began and became a focal point for the pursuit of carbocyclic nucleosides as therapeutic candidates and as probes for biological processes.4 Our interest in aristeromycin and analogs therefrom began with the report of 5\u2032-noraristeromycin (3) with activity towards human cytomegalovirus.5 Over the years6 since 1992 we have looked back to see what analogs lie in the wake of our work that suggested a further look into structural possibilities. Recently, in that regard, we were drawn to our reports that 5\u2032-methylaristeromycin (4)7 and 5\u2032-homoaristeromycin (5)8 have meaningful antiviral properties that had not been developed through analog design. This stimulated us to consider combining the two side chain features of 4 and 5 into diastereomers 6 and 7 (whose designation is derived from 5\u2032-homoaristeromycin in blue possessing a 5\u2032-hydroxyl). The outcome of that pursuit is presented here (see Fig. 1\n).",

Thus, for this investigation, the known N-6 protected carbocyclic adenine nucleoside with the unsaturated C-4\u2032 side chain 8 (available from D-ribose)9 served as the starting point. To achieve the requisite diastereomers 9a and 9b ADmix-\u03b1 (for 9a) and ADmix-\u03b2 (for 9b) were employed, respectively. Deprotection of 9a and 9b with 2 N hydrochloric acid produced 6 and 7. The stereochemistry of 6 and 7 was determined by mesylation of 9a/9b to 10a/10b that were deprotected to 11a/11b. Reductive removal of the 6\u2032-mesylate with lithium aluminum hydride yielded 12a/12b (a convenient, alternative synthesis of those diastereomers). The spectroscopic properties of 12a were identical to that previously reported for 4 (same as 12a).7 To address any possible structural ambiguity in this study, confirmation of 6 was achieved by an X-ray structural analysis.10\n",
