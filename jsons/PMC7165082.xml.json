Although a specific etiology is often not found, a detailed history, physical examination, and diagnostic testing should be pursued to rule out underlying disease and target therapeutic intervention [3].",

To date, >750,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally [4]. A case report of 138 COVID-19 positive patients in Wuhan, China described fever, fatigue, and dry cough as the most common presenting symptoms, although a wide array of presenting complaints have been identified, including but not limited to myalgias, headache, hemoptysis, and isolated gastrointestinal symptoms among others [5,6]. Here we describe a case report of a male patient who presented with persistent hiccups as his chief complaint and was found to be COVID (+) with ground glass opacities on computed tomography (CT) of his chest.",

A CT chest with contrast demonstrated regional, peripheral groundglass opacities of the upper lobes with small focal groundglass opacities scattered throughout the lungs (Fig. 2, Fig. 3\n). Laboratory values were notable for a leukopenia of 4200 cells and thrombocytopenia of 15,000 platelets. He was found to be hyponatremic (131) and hypochloremic (98), otherwise the remainder of his laboratory studies including his troponin, metabolic panel, lactate, and urine studies were non-contributory. The patient was subsequently moved to an isolation room and received 1 g of ceftriaxone and 500 mg of azithromycin intravenously for possible pneumonia. A respiratory viral panel and COVID-19 swab were sent, and he was admitted to the COVID medical unit as a person under investigation.",
