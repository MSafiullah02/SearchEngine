A 2015 study showed that delayed intubation after the failure of high-flow nasal oxygen or noninvasive ventilation for patients with moderate and severe respiratory failure was associated with increased mortality.4 Additionally, approximately 27% of patients only received nasal or face mask oxygen treatment before they died. Several reasons may explain this low proportion. First, some patients with severe hypoxemia did not have other symptoms, such as shortness of breath or dyspnea, also called silent hypoxemia. Second, the lack of enough invasive mechanical ventilators is an important reason that would prevent patients from receiving intubation. Third, a medical team that is not dominated by intensivists may not receive critical care training; therefore, they may be uncertain on the timing for when a patient requires intubation.",

A previous 2020 case series1 also reported a higher rate of hypertension among patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to intensive care units than among patients with COVID-19 who were not admitted to intensive care units. However, hypertension usually is not an independent risk factor associated with mortality in patients with sepsis.5 According to a study from earlier this year,6 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infects the lungs through the angiotensin-converting enzyme II receptor. Further research is needed to find the mechanism of COVID-19. In addition, clinical studies are also needed to confirm whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers could be beneficial for patients with COVID-19.",
