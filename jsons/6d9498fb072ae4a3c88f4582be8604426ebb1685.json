However, in the real scenario, not all users in the seed set are willing to be an in uencer. Based on that, we consider each user associated with a probability with which we can activate her as a seed, and we can a empt to activate her many times. In this paper, we study the adaptive in uence maximization with multiple activations (Adaptive-IMMA) problem, where we select a node at each step, observe whether she accepts to be a seed, if yes, wait to observe the in uence di usion process; If no, we can a empt to activate her again with higher cost, or select other node as a seed. We model the multiple activations mathematically, and de ne it on the domain of integer la ice. We propose a new concept, adaptive DR-submodularity, and show our Adaptive-IMMA is the problem that maximizing an adaptive monotone and DR-submodular function under the knapsack constraint. Adaptive DR-submodular maximization problem is never covered by any existing studies. us, we summarize its properties and study its approximability comprehensively, which is a non-trival generalization of existing analysis about adaptive submodularity. Besides, to overcome the di culty to estimate the in uence spread, we combine adaptive greedy policy with sampling techniques without losing approximation ratio but reducing the time complexity. Finally, we conduct experiments on several real datasets to evaluate the e ectiveness and e ciency of our proposed algorithms.",

More and more people share what they see and discuss some hot issues on these social platforms. Many companies or advertisers exploit the relations established in OSNs to spread their products, opinions or innovations. ey provide those in uential individuals (called \"seed nodes\") with free or discounted samples, in order to create widespread in uence across the whole network via word-ofmouth e ect [8] [19] . Based on that, in uence maximization (IM) problem [16] was formulated, which selects a subset of users (called \"seed set\") for an information cascade to maximize the expected follow-up adoptions (in uence spread). It is a mathematical generalization of plenty of real scenarios, such as viral marketing, rumor blocking and pro t maximization. In the Kempe et al.'s seminal work [16] , they created two discrete in uence di usion models, independent cascade model (IC-model) and linear threshold model (LT-model), where IC-model relies on peer-to-peer communication but LT-model considers the total in uence from user s neighbors. en, they proved the IM problem is NP-hard and achieve a (1\u22121/e)approximate algorithm by simple greedy strategy in the framework of submodularity. Since this seminal work, a series of variant problems used for di erent scenarios and constraints [3] [4] [12] [11] appeared until now, such as pro t maximization, rumor blocking (detection) and community partition.",

When selecting a seed set at the beginning, they all seem to take it for granted that every user in their selected seed set can be activated successfully to become an active seed, and then spread the in uence as they wish. However, there are some users unwilling, even impossible, to be the in uencers. For example, the ho est topic at the moment, Coronavirus in Wuhan, China. Some non-pro t organizations or o cial media are trying to make celebrities speak out to ease the panic among the people. However, due to self-interest or other factors, some celebrities are not willing to be their \"seed nodes\". en, we have two options, one is trying to persuade those who stand on the opposite side sentimentally and rationally, or give up and look for other potential \"seed nodes\". Based on that, we design a new IM with multiple activations (IMMA) problem, here, a node can be activated to be an in uencer with a probability when we select it as a seed, and we can a empt to activate many times. For the same node, each a empt is referred to as a \"trial\", and each trial has a cost. If the rst trial fails, we can conduct the second trial, the third trial, etc., but their cost is higher than the rst.",

In other words, we need to point out the seed set and the number of trials for each node in this seed set in one batch. As a result, it may return a seed that cannot be activated actually or assign too many trials to this node. For example, we give a seed three trials, and it is activated in the rst trial, so the remaining two wastes our budget. us, the non-adaptive seeding strategy is not the best choice to solve our IMMA problem. Golovin et al. [9] studies the IM problem under the adaptive strategy, they select the (i + 1)-th node a er observing the in uence di usion of the rst i nodes until all seed nodes are chosen. Based on that, Adaptive-IMMA problem is proposed in this paper, which selects a seed and a empts to activate it at each step. If successful, wait to observe its in uence process; If failed, record this failed trial. ose nodes on which all the trials are unsuccessful can be considered as seed again in a later step.",

[16] formulated IM as a combinatorial optimization problem, proposed triggering model, including IC-model and LT-model, and gave us a greedy algorithm with (1 \u2212 1/e \u2212 \u03b5)-approximate. It was implemented by monte carlo simulation with high time complexity. Chen et al. followed Kempe's work, and proved its #P-hardness [5] [7] to compute the in uence spread. us, the running time was too slow to apply to larger real networks. A er those seminal works, a lot of researchers made an e ort to improve its time complexity. Brogs et al. [1] proposed the concept of reverse in uence sampling (RIS) to estimate in uence spread, which is scalable in practice and guaranteed theoretically at the same time. en, a series of more efcient randomized algorithms were arisen, such as TIM/TIM+ [26] , IMM [25] . ey were scalable algorithms for the IM problem and can be adapted to other relative problems. However, all of these are used to solve IM problem under the non-adaptive se ing. Golovin et al. [9] extended to adaptive se ing and obtained the same approximation ratio because the objective function of IM is adaptive monotone and adaptive submodular under the full-adoption feedback model. en, adaptive IM under the partial feedback model was studied in [28] [24] . Tong et al. [27] provided a systematic study on the adaptive IM problem, and they introduced the concept of regret ratio in designing the seeding strategy. Han et al. [13] proposed a scalable framework for adaptive IM, motivated by RIS, and considered expected approximation ratio instead of the worst one. DR-submodular maximization problem on la ice a racted more and more researchers' a ention recently. Soma et al. [21] generalized the diminishing return property on the integer la ice rstly and solved submodular cover problem with a bicriteria approximation algorithm. Relied on gradient methods, Hassani et al. [14] addressed monotone continuous DR-submodular maximization e ectively, but assumed that the function is continuous and di erentiable. Soma et al. [23] studied the problem of maximizing monotone DR-submodular functions over the integer la ice exhaustively, where they designed algorithms with (1 \u2212 1/e \u2212 \u03b5)approximation for a cardinality constraint, a polymatroid constraint and a knapsack constraint. Simultaneously, they considered nonmonotone DR-submodular maximization over the integer la ice, and presented a 1/(1+\u03b5)-approximate algorithm within polynomial time. To social networks, Chen et al. [6] investigated IM problem over the la ice, whose objective function is monotone and DRsubmodular. Other literature about submodular optimization on integer la ice are shown in [10] [22] [15] , but none of them considered DR-submodular maximization under the adaptive se ing, which is the main contribution of our paper.",

Instead, in an adaptive manner, we select a node u from V at a time and wait to observe the di usion process. Relied on this observation, we select the next node that could activate those inactive nodes as much as possible. It is called full-adoption feedback model [9] . In other words, when we select a node u as seed, we can know the status of all edges going out from those nodes, which can be reached by u through live edges in current graph realization.

In other words, they are obtained by replacing line 7 in Algorithm 2 with heuristic strategies, summarized as follows: (1) Random: select a node u * uniformly from the feasible node set at each step; (2) MaxDegree: select a node u * that maximizes N + (u)/c( u, x(u)+1 ) at each step; (3) MaxProb: select a node u * that maximizes \u03b2 u /c( u, x(u) + 1 ) at each step; (4) MaxDe-greeProb: select a node u * that maximizes \u03b2 u \u00b7N + (u)/c( u, x(u)+1 ) at each step until using up all budget. by adaptive and non-adaptive se ing under the NetScience and Wiki datasets.
