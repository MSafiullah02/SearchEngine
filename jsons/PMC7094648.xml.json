Isolated SARS cases were reported in Taiwan late 2003 and China early 2004. A novel coronavirus (SARS-associated coronavirus, SCoV) was identified as the agent of SARS [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. SCoV can produce a similar type of pneumonia in monkeys and other animals [7], [8], [9], [10]. There is a ScoV-like viral pool in a large number of wild animals, and it is likely that SCoV was originated from these wild animals and later transmitted to humans [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. SARS can be transmitted through the airway or nasal passage, through urine, water, or domestic pets [2], [9], [10], [17], [18], [19]. The identification of SCoV-like virus from beasts and bats indicates further outbreaks of this disease are difficult to be ruled out. No vaccine or specific effective antiviral method has yet been developed to treat this disease.",

            "text": "SCoV is a large, enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus and its genome is composed of 30-kb nucleotides [19], [20]. The organization of the genome is typical of the coronaviruses, following the characteristic gene order 5\u2032-replicase (rep), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N)-3\u2032 (Fig. 1\n). The non-structural rep gene comprises 21-kb of the genome encoding two polyproteins (encoded by ORF1a and ORF1b) that undergo cotranslational proteolytic processing. The rep gene products are translated from genomic RNA, and play key roles in viral replication and viral gene transcription [19], [20]. These structural proteins are translated from subgenomic mRNA, which are synthesized through a discontinuous transcription process [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. The spike glycoprotein has been shown to be a viral ligand, which plays a critical role in virus binding to its receptor ACE2 or CD209L for viral entry into the host cells [26], [27]. Based on the peptide protection study, we showed that spike protein is a good target for prevention of viral infection [28], [29]. The nucleocapsid protein has been shown to play a role in viral genome package, transcriptional regulation of viral genes, and intracellular signaling [30]. The envelope protein and membrane protein are involved in viral package, viral secretion and virus\u2013cell interactions.",

The intracellular RNA level is of course a key parameter for monitoring the kinetics of viral replication. Therefore, we carried out quantitative RT-PCR experiments to determine SCoV genomic RNA copies in the infected cells at different time points. The infected cells became sever sick 24 h post-infection, therefore, we measured the intracellular viral RNA copies at time point 1, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h. At time point 1 h, we isolated total RNA from infected cells and measured the viral genomic RNA copies by quantitative RT-PCR. We found that the intracellular viral RNA copies were almost same regardless of transfection with or without siRNAs, indicating that transfected siRNA did not prevent virus entry. Therefore, we define the relative copy number as 1. In the control samples, the intracellular viral genomic RNA copies increased over 200 times within 5 h, and increased another 25 times in the following 6 h, as a result, the viral genomic RNA copies were amplified over 5000-fold in FRhk-4 cells in the first 12 h. However, the viral genomic RNA copies were only increased 2 fold either from time point 12 to 18 h or from time point 18 to 24 h (Table 1\n). These results suggested that the viral reproduction displayed two phases in FRhk-4 cells, i.e., fast replication phase (1\u201312 h) and viral package and secretion phase (12\u201324 h).",

            "text": "Specific siRNAs targeted SCoV genomic RNA would lead to viral RNA cleavage in the host cells. We previously identified effective siRNAs targeting rep gene which markedly reduced intracellular viral genomic RNA level [36]. In this study, we showed that siRNAs targeting S/E/M structural genes also inhibited viral RNA accumulation in host cells with lower efficiency (Fig. 4) while exhibited almost the same inhibitory activities for viral reproductions (Fig. 5). There may be several reasons for this phenomenon. First, viral genomic RNA will be immediately translated into viral proteins and undergo a fast RNA replication phase (as measured by time-point experiments) when it enters the cells. Replicase is encoded by viral genomic RNA and directly responsible for viral RNA synthesis. Therefore, siRNA targeting the replicase region will directly reduce replicase. Secondly, the 3\u2032-region of viral genomic RNA encodes several subgenomic mRNAs. The subgenomic mRNAs are abundant in the host cells [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], which may reduce target efficiency or prolongs the time to cleavage of viral genomic RNA. Finally, active transcription and/or translation in the 3\u2032-region of viral genomic RNA may block the siRNA target sites. However, the structural gene products directly contribute to impact viral package and infectious activities. The accumulated infectious viruses rely on both replication, and correct and effective package. Therefore, SARSi-S/-E/-M1/-M2 could display similar inhibitory activities for production of infectious virions to SARSi-R at a saturate concentration in the media.",

In the first 12 h, the viral genomic RNA increased near 6000-fold. However, viral genomic RNA increased only 4\u20136-fold in the next 12 h (Table 1). Viral genomic RNA replication was not potently inhibited in the first six hours post-infection in cells transfected with specific siRNAs targeting any of functional genes, for unknown reasons (Fig. 4). Viral RNA accumulation was almost completely inhibited in cells transfected with SARSi-R until 18 h post-infection. Viral RNA copies were also increasingly multiplied in cells transfected with other specific siRNA (2\u20135-fold) from 6 to 12 h and from 12 to 18 h post-infection. The copies of viral genomic RNA increased faster in cells between 18 and 24 h post-infection in some cases (SARSi-R, and -S). These results suggested that the transfected siRNAs in FRhk-4 cells had a relatively short half-life. Therefore, a sustained expression of shRNA via viral vectors, e.g. adenovirus-based short-term expression vectors, would offer an alternative for anti-SARS therapy.",

We did not observe obvious synergistic anti-SCoV effects when two or three effective siRNAs targeted on the replicase region [32]. In this study, we showed that specific siRNAs at low concentrations with highly concentrated carrier siRNA (total siRNAs maintained as 200 nM, Fig. 5) exhibited potent anti-SCoV activity. As we know, DNA or RNA carrier reagents would increase transfection efficiency and extend the life of transfected DNA or RNA in the cells. Therefore, we first investigated whether siRNAs would display similar antiviral activities at lower doses without carrier siRNA. We found that a single siRNA at a low concentration (10 nM) without carrier siRNA significantly reduced antiviral activities while combination of two siRNAs targeting different functional genes displayed synergistic antiviral activities (Fig. 6). Considering that SARSi-R, -S, -M1 and -M2 could only repress viral reproduction about 2\u20135-fold at 10 nM concentration, and combined siRNAs against two different genes exhibited over 18\u201350-fold reduction, these combinations are very effective. These results suggested that combinations of effective siRNAs targeting different genes could be used in clinical applications with reduced toxicity at a lower cost.",

Our previous study showed that spike protein would be a good target for anti-SARS drug development and siRNA exhibited synergistic antiviral effects with chemical drugs [28], [35].
