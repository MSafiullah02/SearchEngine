In areas of low endemicity, severe malaria occurs in both adults and children and non-immune travelers and migrant workers are also vulnerable [7] .

            "text": "Malaria is a protozoal disease caused by several species of Plasmodium which are spread by mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles [4] . Plasmodium falciparum is one of the four species of Plasmodium causing human infection. The period from inoculation to the appearance of parasitemia (prepatent period) is usually 9 -13 days for P. falciparum, but may be longer, particularly in those who have been on ineffective prophylaxis [4] . During feeding the female mosquito injects saliva, within which malaria sporozoites are carried, into the skin. Within minutes the sporozoites penetrate into hepatocytes and produce tissue schizonts (also known as meronts). After 5 -7 days, each tissue schizont has produced 30,000 daughter merozoites that enter the circulation, invade erythrocytes and form ring trophozoites [4] . Using hemoglobin as energy, development occurs after 48 h into late trophozoites (larger and lacier in appearance), early blood schizonts (division begins) and then mature schizonts [4] . The erythrocytes then lyse and merozoites are released into the circulation to invade other red blood cells [4] . In non-immune individuals, the process is amplified 20-fold with each cycle. When parasitemia reaches 10 -15 trophozoites per microliter, it is detectable on thick blood films, ending the prepatent period [4] . After several cycles, some trophozoites differentiate into sex cells or gametocytes, which are infectious to the mosquito. The gametocyte of P. falciparum is characteristically banana-shaped. If male and female gametocytes are taken up by the mosquito, they mate, migrate through the midgut wall and form an oocyst which eventually leads to the release of about 1,000 sporozoites after 5 -8 days [4] . These invade the salivary glands of the mosquito to complete the cycle at the next blood meal [4] .",

It is recognized that there are clear-cut distinctions between severe and non-severe disease and between the different forms of severe disease [10] . An important question is why Plasmodium falciparum causes severe infection in some, but not all, patients. This relates partly to the age of the patient, history of prior exposure to the parasite and various aspects of the hosts' immune response [7 -11] . Most interestingly, it is now recognized that many of the differences in response may relate to diversity or polymorphisms in both the host and the parasite, which may impact on disease pathogenesis and be the major determinants of the outcome of a malarial infection [8] [9] [10] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . For example, in the host, possession of hemoglobin AS genotype influences the risk of both cerebral malaria and severe anemia [9] , whereas possession of certain HLA genotypes (e.g., HLA-B53) may be linked to resistance to these two complications [12, 13] . Susceptibility to both these complications is linked to polymorphism in the promoter sequence for the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) gene [15, 16] , whereas susceptibility to each of these complications individually is influenced by mutations at other sites [9] . Also, different strains of P. falciparum have been shown to vary in their ability to induce production of host TNF, and this may determine the clinical severity of the infection [14] . In addition, clonal phenotypic variation with antigenic switching is linked to, and may alter, adhesive properties of the parasite and this may be an important mechanism of immune evasion [8] . Finally, specific adhesive and linked antigenic types may be associated with severe infection [1, 8] .",

There has been some debate in the literature about the definition of both severe malaria and cerebral malaria. A definition of cerebral malaria proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) reads as follows \"A clinical syndrome characterized by coma (inability to localize a painful stimulus) at least one hour after termination of a seizure or correction of hypoglycemia, detection of asexual forms of P. falciparum malaria parasites on peripheral blood smears, and exclusion of other causes of encephalopathy\" [17, 18] . More recently, severe malaria has been recognized to be a complex multi-system disorder and to have many of the features in common with severe sepsis or a severe inflammatory response syndrome [19, 20] . Studies of outcome of patients with falciparum malaria in the intensive care unit (ICU) commonly report that markers of severity of illness (such as the SAPS or APACHE II score), shock, acidosis, coma, pulmonary edema and coagulation disorders are indicators of poor outcome [21] . The level of parasitemia has not consistently been shown to be a good predictor of outcome. Metabolic acidosis has long been recognized as a major predictor of, as well as a significant contributor to, death [6, 20] . Whereas lactate has been considered to be the major contributor to the acidosis, unidentified anions other than lactate have been shown, more recently, to be even more important [22] . Attempts to assess severity of infection objectively have included other markers, such as the procalcitonin level, which has shown some promise [23] .",

In addition, some isolates induce expression of receptors on noninfected red cells, leading to rosette formation, and still others induce expression of adhesion molecules on other parasitized cells causing auto-agglutination [27] . These phenomena can lead to reduced microcirculatory flow or even obstruction to local blood flow and/or cause local metabolic disturbances, such as the production of lactic acid, which may manifest as organ-specific dysfunction [27 -30] . Multiple endothelial receptors have been recognized (reviewed elsewhere [30, 31] ), and it has now been demonstrated that endothelial activation and leukocyte sequestration in the brain appear to be a feature of fatal malaria [27, 32] .",

Immunological mechanisms were considered following the detection of immune complexes and complement in affected brains [7, 34] and still others have investigated the possibility that disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [34] or endotoxemia [36] may be involved.",

Careful fluid management is essential and may be aided by the placement of a central venous catheter and a urinary catheter. The importance of hypovolemia in severe malaria is well recognized, particularly in children, and early recognition and treatment may be associated with an improved outcome [47, 48] . However, care should be taken to avoid fluid overload with the possibility of precipitating pulmonary edema. In patients with severe hemodynamic instability, non-invasive cardiac output monitoring may be of value. A recent meta-analysis of exchange transfusion as adjunctive management of severe malaria concluded that there was no evidence of an increase in survival with its use [49] . However, the authors indicated that there were substantial problems with the comparability of the two treatment groups and suggested that only a randomized controlled trial would give definitive answers.

However, there is growing concern about the development of resistance to these agents, which is already beginning to emerge [72 -74] .

Tetracyclines are contraindicated in pregnancy and childhood. Where initial response to therapy is poor, halofantrine or mefloquine have been recommended [6, 7] .

The gag reflex is usually maintained but abdominal reflexes are invariably absent. This latter may be a valuable clinical sign [6, 7] . Papilledema is not a feature of cerebral malaria, probably reflecting the fact that raised intracranial pressure is not found in the majority of patients early in the course of the illness [6, 7, 78] . Forcible jaw closure and bruxism are common [6, 7] .",

Whereas the absolute indications for dialysis are similar to those of other situations and include severe hyperkalemia, fluid overload, metabolic acidosis and uremia, continuous dialysis should be initiated early, prior to the development of fluid overload, and not be dictated by an arbitrary metabolic parameter such as creatinine [6, 83, 84] .",

It appears to be due to tissue hypoxia as a consequence of stagnant flow of parasitized red blood cells through capillary beds [6] . Other factors may include impaired hepatic blood flow (a site of lactate disposal) and high cytokine levels (TNF leads to lactate production) [6] . In addition, the malaria parasite itself produces large amounts of lactate as a by-product of glycolysis. The possible important role of unidentified anions other than lactate has been described above [22] . The acidosis of severe bacterial sepsis appears to involve peroxynitrite induced mitochondrial dysfunction and it is possible that a similar mechanism is involved with severe malaria [85] . Therapy should include correction of hypotension and hypoxemia, if present [6] . Whether correction of an acidosis improves outcome is not known. It should only be corrected if the pH falls below 7.15, if at all, since infusion may worsen pulmonary edema due to the large sodium load [6] .

It was further recommended that patients with hyperparasitemia should have an exchange blood transfusion [6, 86] . This recommendation was not based on large prospective randomized studies, but followed individual case reports and is confounded in some cases by patients with malaria with higher levels of parasitemia who recover without transfusion and in others by the fact that total parasite burden may not be reflected in the peripheral smear [4, 6, 86] . In addition, as described above, a recent meta-analysis of exchange transfusion in the literature, while acknowledging problems with the studies reviewed, concluded that there was no evidence, in general, of its benefit [49] . It has also been noted that facilities for full exchange transfusions (6 -8 units of blood) are often not widely available, although in these situations it was previously suggested that partial exchange transfusion (e.g., 4 units) could be undertaken [3, 6] .",

Firstly it may occur in pregnant women, where in addition to neurological sequelae it may also cause fetal distress [6, 7] . Unless it has been prolonged and very severe it is associated with a good prognosis and responds well to glucose administration. Secondly, hypoglycemia may occur in severely ill patients and be associated with severe anemia, jaundice, hyperparasitemia, lactic acidosis and coma [6, 7] . Quinine-induced stimulation of insulin release may be an important mechanism, but other factors, including glucose consumption by the parasite, may be contributory [6, 7, 87] . Other mechanisms that have been considered as possible causes of hypoglycemia include depleted hepatic glycogen stores and inhibition of hepatic gluco-neogenesis [7] . Many of the usual clinical features of hypoglycemia are absent, or are masked by, or interpreted as the symptoms of malaria, but whenever the level of consciousness deteriorates in patients with malaria, hypoglycemia should be suspected [6, 7, 87] . Glucose requirements may be high and infusions of 50 % glucose followed by 10 -20 % glucose, preferably through a central venous catheter, may be required to maintain adequate blood levels [6] .",

The exact mechanism by which pregnancy enhances the susceptibility to, and the risk of, complicated disease is not certain. However, red cells containing mature forms of the asexual parasites are found in the placenta, being a key feature of maternal infection with P. falciparum, and are associated with significant compromise of placental function [6, 89] . Placental parasites express different surface ligands that facilitate immune evasion and their adhesion to specific placental molecules [89] . Treatment should start immediately and the potential teratogenic or abortifacient properties of quinine and chloroquine in this severe situation should be ignored and in any case are considered by many authorities to have been largely exaggerated [4, 6, 7, 90] . Blood glucose levels should be measured frequently and, where possible, fetal monitoring should be undertaken [6] .

Hypoglycemia, seizures, severe anemia and sudden death are more common, whereas renal failure, pulmonary edema and jaundice are less likely than in adults [4, 6, 7] . Although respiratory distress does not appear in the original WHO definition of severe malaria, it is recognized by clinicians treating children with malaria as an important sign which is not usually due to pulmonary edema or ARDS [91 -93] . It has also been termed the malaria hyperpneic syndrome [91] . Possible causes include cardiac failure, coexistent pneumonia, direct sequestration of parasites in the lungs, or a sign of cerebral malaria [93] . It is important to remember that the clinical features of pneumonia and malaria, both common causes of childhood morbidity and mortality in the developing world, overlap considerably and many children fulfilling the WHO criteria for pneumonia may actually have malaria [9, 94] . The majority of cases of respiratory distress in children are associated with lactic acidosis and this is well documented as a poor prognostic factor [93, 95] . After cerebral malaria, 9 -26 % of children may have neurologic sequelae of 24.24 Special Considerations in Children which half will resolve completely [3, 4, 96] . Hypoglycemic children are at greater risk of neurologic sequelae and/or death [4] . It is important to remember in the treatment of children with malaria that drug dosages need to be modified [4] .",
