            "text": "It is postulated that CRCoV plays an important role during the early stages of CIRD by predisposing the dog to more severe clinical disease from secondary infections. Through the use of an in vitro tracheal explant culture system, a moderate reduction in ciliary function and a down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA levels (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and the chemokine IL-8) was observed in response to CRCoV exposure (Priestnall et al., 2009). Such alterations in the mucociliary and innate immune systems could be linked to increased susceptibility to secondary infection and is consistent with the proposed role for CRCoV in CIRD. However, the limitation of this in vitro model precludes the understanding of the clinical relevance and pathogenesis of a CRCoV infection in the dog. Furthermore, given the global presence of this virus, insight into CRCoV pathogenesis among isolates originating from geographically distinct locations would be valuable to determine the need for a global vaccine.",

Despite differences, both studies clearly illustrate that CRCoV is a quick-hit respiratory pathogen, and supports field data in which the rapid spread of CRCoV throughout a large rehoming centre was observed (Erles et al., 2003).",

Furthermore, histopathological analysis showed a clear association between exposure to CRCoV and inflammation in the nares and trachea, with loss or damage to cilia in the latter. These changes were particularly marked in dogs belonging to T4 and T5, which may indicate a higher degree of pathogenicity for those CRCoV strains; although, with the exception of one dog in T5 this was not apparent from the clinical signs. Ciliary clearance is a key strategy for the removal of pathogens from the respiratory tract.

Histological changes in the lymphoid tissues of most dogs in the study (T1\u2013T6 inclusive) included hyperplasia. Lymphoid hyperplasia is not uncommon in dogs at this age, particularly in the palatine tonsil. Acute inflammatory responses were evident; however in some dogs this may have been associated with the presence of fragments of foreign material (e.g. hair) in the tonsillar crypts.

The molecular detection of CRCoV in the rectal swabs of some dogs from T1 is interesting, and consistent with findings from a number of previous reports of dogs naturally infected with CRCoV (Decaro et al., 2007, Yachi and Mochizuki, 2006, Mitchell et al., 2009). Dogs in the T1 challenge group were unique in that they were the only dogs to be challenged with virus that had not been grown in vitro. The inability to detect CRCoV from dogs in other challenge groups may therefore be a result of cell culture adaptation; alternatively, this may be a strain specific phenomenon. At present there is no conclusive evidence that CRCoV displays a true dual tropism for respiratory and enteric tissues. The failure to isolate CRCoV from enteric samples collected during the peak oropharyngeal shedding period, suggests that CRCoV may pass through the canine gut as a bystander, without infection. Nevertheless, enteric shedding could have implications for managing the spread of disease, and therefore further investigation is warranted.",

This observation is not unexpected due to the viral antigenic stimulation, and the lymphocytic reactions found in various tissues. What was somewhat less expected is the high number of dogs with decreased neutrophil concentrations, including a number which developed neutropenia, mild left shift and toxicity, best seen in groups T1, T2, T4, and T5.

In SARS coronavirus infected patients the picture is mixed. Neutropenia has been reported in some cases, however, in most cases high blood neutrophil concentrations were observed, and this is often associated with a poor clinical outcome (Lee et al., 2003, Manocha et al., 2003, Wong et al., 2003). Neutrophil infiltration of tissues infected with different coronaviruses such as SARS, MHV and Rat CoV has also been described (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1977, Iacono et al., 2006, Ding et al., 2003); however, their role in viral clearance and possible immune pathology is largely unknown.

This degree of serological cross reactivity is not unexpected given the high degree of amino acid similarity seen in the spike protein of different isolates published to date. Whilst the correlation between neutralising titres and protection in vivo is yet to be determined, this finding supports published data which demonstrated that the presence of CRCoV specific antibodies in dogs significantly decreased the risk of developing respiratory disease upon entry to the kennel (Erles et al., 2003). These findings support a possible role for vaccinating against CRCoV as part of a preventative strategy for respiratory disease in kennelled dogs. Moreover, based on the high degree of cross neutralisation and high degree of amino acid identity among the CRCoV spike proteins described to date, it is anticipated that a single CRCoV isolate as a vaccine antigen will be sufficient to provide protection against CRCoV induced respiratory disease.",

Isolation of CRCoV was achieved from a wide variety of respiratory and mucosal associated lymphoid tissues, lung lavage fluids and swabs collected over the 2-week period, thus providing clear evidence of tropism for the canine respiratory tract, accompanied by respiratory shedding. Moreover, we have shown CRCoV infection is associated with marked histopathological changes in the nares and trachea, with loss and damage to tracheal cilia alongside inflammatory responses. Significant effects on the leukogram, in the form of clinically relevant lymphocytosis and neutrophil changes were also documented. Strong serological and cross neutralising reactivity between heterologous CRCoV isolates demonstrates antigenic homogeneity among CRCoV from the two continents. This study provides vital evidence supporting a role for CRCoV in the CIRD complex. Defining the role that CRCoV and other agents play in CIRD is a considerable, but important, challenge if the disease is to be managed, treated and prevented more successfully.",
