In Japan as well, a major outbreak of EV\u2010D68 peaked in the autumn of 2015.4 The reason for this seasonal circulation of EV\u2010D68, which often occurs later than typical EV outbreaks, remains unknown.5 In an exceptional report from Australia in 2010 and 2013, EV\u2010D68 was detected during the winter\u2013spring months of July\u2013October.26 Although one article suggested an endemic circulation of EV\u2010D68 in Taiwan,27 whether EV\u2010D68 is endemic in Japan or globally remains to be clarified.7\n",

Second, although some patients in the PCR\u2010negative group may have been infected with EV\u2010D68, patients with slow progression of symptoms could have been sampled later in the clinical course, resulting in a viral load undetectable on PCR.

While none of the three patients who were EV\u2010D68 PCR positive and admitted to the ICU had a history of asthma, one patient had a history of milk allergy and chromosome abnormality. In contrast, one of three patients who were EV\u2010D68 PCR negative and admitted to the ICU had a history of asthma and preterm delivery. Although these results are not in line with some previous reports and the present retrospective design might have meant that thorough history taking was not possible, it should be noted that the reliability and validity of asthma diagnosis are likely to differ across different studies. One study from the Netherlands compared three methods, namely, self\u2010reported asthma, ICD\u201010 diagnosis from a hospitalization registry, and data on anti\u2010asthmatic medication use from a prescription registry to explore the prevalence of asthma and examine the agreement between different methods, and found a substantial non\u2010overlap between the methods regarding asthma prevalence.31 Another article reported that dependence on parental report might result in underestimation of the prevalence of serious asthma, especially among poor children in the USA.32 This suggests that different methods produce different prevalences of asthma even in the same cohort of children, and therefore it is plausible that this would happen across different cohorts. Moreover, a diagnosis of asthma in early childhood may not be accurate due to the frequency of viral infections resembling asthmatic symptoms.33, 34 In short, whether or not the presence of asthma influences the severity of EV\u2010D68 respiratory infection requires further research.",

            "text": "The present study has a number of limitations. First, although we collected information from all patients with defined respiratory symptoms who were admitted during the study period, we were able to recruit and obtain samples for EV\u2010D68 and multiplex PCR in only 46% of the hospitalized patients because patients with short\u2010term admission were discharged before providing informed consent and samples. This low recruitment rate could have biased the results for missing mild cases. This potential selection bias, however, is less likely to have distorted the result because no one, including physicians, investigators, or patients, knew the EV\u2010D68 case status at the time of recruitment. Second, several respiratory pathogens such as parainfluenza virus or Bordetella pertussis were not tested for in the study and might have been missed. Third, mild cases of EV\u2010D68 infection might have been overlooked because one of the inclusion criteria was hospitalization. The restriction of recruitment to patients who were admitted precluded us from obtaining samples from patients who visited the outpatient ward. As a result, we could not infer to what degree EV\u2010D68 was associated with symptoms in patients who had wheezing but in whom the symptoms were not severe enough to require hospitalization during this period, although we observed a surge in patients with wheezing, which was unprecedented (Fig. 1) and the same phenomenon was observed nationally.23 Fourth, in the EV\u2010D68 PCR\u2010negative group, some patients infected with EV\u2010D68 might have been missed on PCR due to the long interval between sampling and symptom onset. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend collecting samples 0\u20137 days after symptom onset for real\u2010time PCR to detect non\u2010polio Enterovirus.37 In addition, according to nationwide surveillance in the USA, respiratory specimens collected \u22647 days after respiratory illness/fever onset compared with any time had a higher detection rate of EV\u2010D68 (47% vs 20%).12 Thus, for the additional analyses, we chose 7 days as the cut\u2010off point from the onset of any symptoms. We found a statistically significant difference in EV\u2010D68 positivity between patients whose sample were collected \u22647 days after onset and \u22658 days (P = 0.044, Fisher's exact test). Nonetheless, we did not find a significant difference in baseline and clinical characteristics and concluded that the misclassification had not substantially biased the result (Tables 1, 2). Finally, there might remain a potential misclassification, stemming from the fact that the EV\u2010D68\u2010negative group could contain both patients with viral infection and those with asthma attack due to non\u2010infectious causes. Thus, we conducted an additional analysis by dividing the EV\u2010D68\u2010negative group into two groups: EV\u2010D68 negative but positive on multiplex RT\u2010PCR, and negative for both EV\u2010D68 and multiplex RT\u2010PCR. Then, we compared baseline and clinical characteristics between the three groups, namely, EV\u2010D68 PCR positive group, EV\u2010D68 PCR negative but positive on multiplex RT\u2010PCR, and negative for both EV\u2010D68 and multiplex RT\u2010PCR, and confirmed that there was no significant difference between the results in Table 1 and that of the additional analysis. Furthermore, it may be reasonable that the potential misclassification regarding the disease status among EV\u2010D68\u2010negative group was likely to be non\u2010differential, and multiplex PCR is faster and more sensitive for viral detection than traditional viral culture methods.38\n",
