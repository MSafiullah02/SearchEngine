On April 21, a daily increase of 830 cases, the largest daily increase since COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore, brought its total to 8014 cases with 11 deaths. 1 Singapore authorities quickly tightened entry restrictions, closed non-essential business, and reinforced strict order on social distancing. Japan: Japan initially responded to COVID-19 outbreak by repatriating Japanese citizens from Wuhan and initiating border control regulations. As the number of community spread increased, Japan prioritized its policy on restricting large-scale clusters. A one-month 'state of emergency' order was declared on April 7, 2020 that allowed the government to impose social distancing measures, instructing residents to avoid unnecessary outings, and restricting, or closing businesses and facilities. In addition, the widespread use of facial masks along with the greeting customs of a bow instead of a handshake perhaps played a role as well in slowing down COVID-19 spread in Japan.",

The country quickly developed COVID-19 diagnostic kits and implemented large-scale testing that helped public health officials identify and quarantine infected and potentially infected cases separately. By mid-March, 2020, more than 270,000 individuals were tested at drive-thru and walk-through facilities. In addition, the government provided free smartphone apps to alert people with emergency text in their local area. The app also allowed patients to input their symptoms to get diagnosed or connected to a doctor for COVID-19 screening. Along with early testing, South Korea implemented contacttracing programs that consisted of official interview, GPS tracking, and video surveillance to trace the travel history of a COVID-19 case.Within a month, without large-scale lockdowns or extreme measures of restricting the movement of people, South Korea brought COVID-19 outbreak under control and kept virus at bay. As of April 24, 2020, a total of 10,708 cases with 240 deaths were reported in South Korea. 1 Since mid-March, 2020, South Korea has seen only a handful of new cases per day. Taiwan: Taiwan started inspecting passengers for COVID-19 infection symptoms since the WHO first notified of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, China. In early January, any individuals with travel history to Wuhan in the past 14 days were tracked for COVID-19 infection symptoms. Meanwhile, Taiwan began to integrating its national health insurance database with its immigration and custom databases to generate an alert on a patient's travel history and clinical conditions to assist the identification of high-risk infection cases during patients' clinic visits. In addition, Taiwan started to triage passengers in the airport and classify passengers' infectious risks based on flight origin and travel history in the past 14 days.",
