With more frequent prone positioning of patients, both conscious and in those undergoing IMV, it is increasingly likely for cardiac arrests to occur in the prone position. Whilst fulminant COVID may not be amenable to resuscitative attempts, reversible causes of cardiorespiratory arrest will still occur in this cohort. As such resuscitation institutions are required to provide clear guidance to frontline clinicians, outlining how best to undertake cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the prone position and how and when to turn patients to limit both delays to CPR and reduce risks of viral transmission to healthcare workers.",

In the UK, intubated patients with COVID-19 should only reside in areas where sessional use of FFP3 masks is mandated, thereby mitigating delays to CPR caused by time taken to don PPE. However, turning patients can require up to six personnel and may lead to dislodging of endotracheal tubes and lines. To avoid such complications, prone CPR could be trialed initially using end-tidal CO2 and arterial pressure and waveforms to judge its efficacy before a decision to turn to supine CPR is made. The process of turning itself requires clear instruction from resuscitation institutions, noting how and when to clamp endotracheal tubes, or temporarily cease ventilation pressures, to reduce the risk of viral transmission to healthcare workers.",

As such, the UK Resuscitation Counsel advises the use of defibrillation prior to commencing compressions. This guidance does not incorporate patients in the prone position and updates could include advocating anterior-posterior defibrillation. However, all patients are likely to require a turn where not intubated at the time of arrest given the paramount importance of securing a definitive airway as early as possible; even the most experienced anaesthetist will find it challenging to attempt intubation in the prone position.",
