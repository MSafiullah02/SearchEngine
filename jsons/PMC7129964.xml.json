And further, the safety of using air-condition in SARS lazarettos has become an urgent problem with the coming of summer. Photo catalysis by titanium dioxide (TiO2) is an alternative to conventional chemical disinfectors [1], [2]. However, this technology can only work with ultraviolet light and requires a relatively complex device. On the other hand, surface science and catalysis studies show that oxygen molecules can adsorb and dissociate into active oxygen atoms on some metal surfaces [3], [4], and the oxidation of CO and volatile chemical compounds occurs over some supported metal catalysts at room temperature [5], [6], [7]. These facts strongly suggest that those catalysts are very promising to be used in air-condition systems for air disinfection. Here, we report the inactivation efficiency of Ag/Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3 to SARS coronavirus, bacteria and yeast.",

Both bacteria and yeast cultures of 48 h revealed no colony after treatment with Ag/Al2O3 for 5 min, but 16\u201319 yeast colonies were found using Cu/Al2O3. On the other hand, 105\u2013106 colonies of E. coli and D. polymorphus were, respectively, detected in control tests with Al2O3 wafers and filter papers. The inactivation of D. polymorphus by the two catalysts was supported by light-microscopy observation. When the viability stain method with trypan blue was applied to catalytically inactivated yeast cells, a large number of strongly coloured cells appeared after treated for 5 min using Ag/Al2O3 and 10 min using Cu/Al2O3 in contrast to the control.",

These SEM images show that the yeast cells are dramatically destructed on the Ag/Al2O3 surface, which indicates that the inactivation is caused by chemical reaction and decomposition. However, Figs. 1(c) and (d) SEM images show that the cell surfaces were quite smooth on the Cu/Al2O3 wafer even though most of them were inactivated.",

Western blot assays with PrP specific monoclonal antibody revealed that the recombinant virus treated with Ag/Al2O3 wafer could not produce any detectable PrP protein. However, the elution of the control filter revealed the expected band. The results of inactivation to the three microbes are summarized in Table 1\n.

One can also note that the remains of yeast cells on Ag/Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3 are quite different, though they are all inactivated, indicating different mechanisms for the two catalysts. It is worth while to point out that both Ag/Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3 surfaces did not show any disinfection for bacteria and yeast in a close environment without oxygen, which strongly indicates that the inactivation is caused by catalytic oxidation rather than by toxicity of heavy metals.",
