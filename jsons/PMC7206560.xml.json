(c) 15N{1H}-NOE values, I\nrel, plotted versus HKU4 M crosspeaks in the didomain, in order of increasing\nintensity. I\nrel lower than 0.6 indicates flexibility in the residue. Q1445 and A1521 in the\nHKU4 C single domain fall below this threshold, as they are residues found in the N- and\nC-terminal respectively. In the didomain, R1520 gains greater flexibility, while Q1445\nloses flexibility due to no longer being a terminal residue. There are 11 residues in the\nHKU4-M domain that are flexible.
