            "text": "Unlike other organs, the central nervous system (CNS) does not have a traditional lymphatic system or native lymphocytes. Thus, a viral invasion of the CNS requires signaling from the CNS's innate immune system in order to recruit inflammatory cells from the circulation. This signaling typically involves the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines into the circulation. The identity of these CNS immune cells that are capable of signaling the immune system is not entirely clear. Microglial cells are CNS immune cells (Nelson et al., 2002), but astrocytes may also have immune functions in the CNS (Farina et al., 2007). Astrocytes, the most abundant cells in the CNS, are heterogeneous and multifunctional, and were recently discovered to be part of the glial lymphatic system (glymphatic) of the CNS (Jessen et al., 2015; Negi and Das, 2018). Astrocytes are divided into subgroups based on morphology and function (Seidman et al., 1997; ffrench-Constant and Raff, 1986), but which subtype of astrocytes forms the glymphatic system and induces CNS innate immune functions is unknown.",

Mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV- A59), is a neurotropic virus that, with intracerebral or intranasal injection, causes encephalitis followed by an inflammatory demyelinating disease in mice similar to the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (Lavi et al., 1984a; Lavi et al., 1984b; Lavi et al., 1988; Lavi et al., 1999).

Genes were considered present if the expression level was greater than two times that of the blank negative control.

This indicates that both murine and human brains have an anatomical structure designed to provide these immune functions. The ideal site for these functions is a structure composed by cell types that have direct relationship with endothelial cells, thus, forming the perivascular glymphatic system. We therefore investigated whether, in human brain, perivascular astrocytes have the morphology of type I astrocytes and whether microglial cells also send processes to a perivascular location and participate in the brain glymphatic system. We selected random images of human brain sections stained with antibodies that identify glial and microglial cells (GFAP and CD68 respectively). These sections, representing the same pattern of anatomical findings in any human brain, were used to present anatomical structures that exist in all human brains. We identified small caliber and capillary blood vessels completely surrounded by GFAP astrocytic foot processes. Also, intermittent processes of CD68 positive microglial cells were identified in the perivascular space. Cells of the perivascular distribution expressed morphological features of type I astrocytes, but not type II or III (Fig. 4\n).",

The coronavirus genus of viruses belongs to the coronaviridae family of the nidovirales order that produce a variety of hepatic, enteric, and neurologic diseases in animals, and upper respiratory and enteric diseases in humans (Cavanagh, 1997; Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Lavi et al., 1999; Lavi and Weiss, 1989). In 2003 a virulent coronavirus infection caused an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), followed by middle eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) (Peiris et al., 2003). In 2019, a new human coronavirus emerged, named SARS CoV-2, causing the pandemic of COVID-19. Both the original SARS virus and SARS CoV-2 induce cytokine release mainly IL-6, contributing to a \u201ccytokine storm,\u201d that exacerbates viral pathogenesis, resulting in a high mortality rate (Cheung et al., 2005; Channappanavar and Perlman, 2017; Mehta et al., 2020). The understanding of the pathogenesis of human coronaviruses is greatly enhanced by studies of experimental animal models of coronaviruses.",

            "text": "MHV-A59 is a member of the coronavirus genus that with intracerebral or intranasal exposure in mice produces a bi-phasic disease with acute hepatitis, meningitis, and encephalitis followed by chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease. While the acute phase of the disease is associated with direct viral replication and antigen expression in the brain and liver, the chronic, immune-mediated, demyelinating disease is associated with rare RNA persistence in the brain, without evidence of direct viral replication or antigen expression. Demyelination was found to be molecularly controlled by a region in the S1 portion of the spike glycoprotein gene of MHV-A59, downstream from the receptor binding domain, based on mutational analysis and the finding that a single point mutation (Asparagine to Serine in position 345 of S gene) abolished demyelination completely (Das Sarma et al., 2000; Das Sarma et al., 2001a; Fu et al., 2004; Fu and Lavi, 2005). MHV-2 in comparison, is a hepatotropic virus causing hepatitis, and mild meningitis without encephalitis, even when inoculated intracerebrally. Neurovirulence and the ability of MHV to cause encephalitis is directly related to its ability to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines, both in vivo and in vitro (Li et al., 2004). The present investigation determined that infection with the encephalitic strain MHV-A59 produced a pro-inflammatory cytokine reaction of the innate immune system mediated by microglia and type I astrocytes. This is in contrast to the non-encephalitic strain (MHV-2) which did not produce a cytokine response. It is therefore concluded that a cytokine response determines the ability of the virus to cause encephalitis.",

All of these cytokines are known to be pro-inflammatory and some have known innate immune functions, including maintenance of the blood brain barrier integrity. In general, the cytokine response in type I astrocytes was consistent with a TH1and TH17 response (role in pro-inflammation and autoimmunity). The cytokine response profile in microglia was primarily involving IL-6, interferons and TNF. IL-6 in its initial response is also pro-inflammatory; although, it can also serve at later stages of infection as inducer of IL-10 and anti-inflammatory reaction. Thus, the profiles of the cytokine response in both cell types were complementary and aimed at inducing a pro-inflammatory reaction that would enable a cellular inflammatory reaction to enter the CNS and be directed against the invading virus. The lack of induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-10, due to coronavirus infection may explain the enhanced inflammatory response that occurs during a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d.",

It is well known that astrocytic foot processes surround brain capillaries and during development induce endothelial cells to form tight junctions which are the basis for the blood brain barrier. The immune reaction in the brain originates in a perivascular structure, known as the glymphatic system, because of its similarity to the systemic lymphatic system. The morphology of the cultured type I astrocytes appears to be identical to the morphology of human perivascular astrocytes that send their foot processes to the blood vessels. The morphology of these perivascular astrocytes is clearly different from the cultured type II or type III. In addition, we found immunohistochemical evidence in human tissue that microglia also send processes that are in close proximity to endothelial cells, likely participating with astrocytes type I in the perivascular structure. The combination of the morphological study with the function of cytokine production suggests that type I astrocytes and microglia form the perivascular glymphatic system that is involved in an innate immune reaction by the secretion of cytokines following a neurotropic encephalitic viral infection. A graphic illustration of the perivascular role of type I astrocytes and microglia in the blood brain barrier and glymphatic system is shown in Fig. 5\n.",

Infection with both murine and human coronaviruses induce a proinflammatory cytokine reaction, most notably involving IL-6. Inhalation of MHV-A59 causes limbic encephalitis (Lavi et al., 1988) and anosmia (loss of smell and taste) is common in COVID-19 suggesting involvement of the olfactory nerves with both viral infections. Central nervous system infection is seen with both murine and human coronaviruses. Acute and subacute neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 include change in mental status, amnesia, delirium, encephalitis, stroke and a GBS like illness (Asadi-Pooya and Simani, 2020; Toscano et al., 2020). Cerebrovascular disease occurs in about 5% of patients with COVID-19 including in those younger than 50 years old. Strokes involve both large and small vessels, in arterial and venous circulations, in multiple vascular territories. The pathophysiology of the varied cerebrovascular symptomatology is presumed to be due to cytokine upregulation, coagulopathy and endothelial cell dysfunction (Oxley et al., 2020; Bevrouti et al., 2020). The RNA viral persistence in patients with COVID-19 (Wang et al., 2020), was similar to rare RNA persistence described in MHV-A59 infection (Lavi et al., 1984a). Due to differences in organ affinity, COVID-19 had RNA persistence in the gastrointestinal tract while MHV-A59 persistence was in the brain. Infection with the coronavirus MHV-A59 is a murine model for the CNS demyelinating disease, multiple sclerosis. Infection with the coronavirus SARS CoV-2 is recently recognized and its long-term neurological consequences, if any, are as yet unknown. Long term monitoring of patients who survived COVID-19 is needed to determine if there are any remote neurological effects of the SARS CoV-2 infection.",
