Each year an estimated three to four hundred million people will contract malaria globally, resulting in five hundred thousand to two million deaths. Ninety percent of the world's malaria, and at least 90% of malaria-related mortality, occurs in Sub-Saharan Africa, primarily in young children (2). Malaria occurs in every country in sub-Saharan Africa, with the exception of Lesotho, but transmission rates vary within regions and within countries. In parts of Africa where endemicity of malaria is high and transmission stable, such as Tanzania, Malawi, and Mozambique, severe malaria is mainly a disease of children under 5 years of age and of pregnant women. It is less common in older children and adults because of the partial immunity acquired as a result of repeated infections. In areas of low endemicity severe malaria occurs in both adults and children. Non-immune travellers to malaria areas are always at risk for severe disease (3,4).",

The development of parasite resistance to chemotherapeutic agents such as chloroquine has resulted in a significant increase in malaria morbidity and mortality. The demise of chloroquine, an affordable option in resource-poor countries, has major implications for malaria management (5). In Africa resources for management of severe malaria are limited and at least 20-30% of patients with complications of disease will die. In a confidential inquiry into malaria deaths in an area of South Africa with limited tertiary care facilities, major contributing factors were delays in diagnosis and initiation of adequate therapy, failure to administer the correct antimalarial at the correct dosage and frequency, inadequate monitoring of severity indicators in complicated cases, and the suboptimal management of complications (6).",

Factors that determine whether a patient develops mild or severe disease are complex and multifactorial and are related to both the parasite and the host. Parasites causing severe malaria have a greater multiplication potential than those causing uncomplicated infections (8). The effect of inoculum dose on severity is unclear and difficult to investigate. Cyto-adherence of parasitised red cells may be influenced by the virulence of different strains of parasite (9).",

Lack of this protective immunity would be expected to be the major factor determining the severity of a clinical attack of malaria.

Prevalence rates of these abnormalities are high in some parts of Africa and may provide some protection against severe malaria (9).

An initial loading dose of quinine to rapidly reach a therapeutic level is critical in the management of severe malaria and has a major impact on favourable outcome. The loading dose should be omitted if the patient has definitely received mefloquine, quinine, quinidine or halofantrine in the previous 24 hours, mefloquine in the previous seven days, or 40mg/kg of quinine in the previous two days. If there is doubt, the loading dose of quinine should be given (4, 11, 16) . The loading dose is given as quinine di-hydrochloride salt, 20mg/kg body weight diluted in 5-10 ml/kg body weight of dextrose water, by slow intravenous infusion over two to four hours. Quinine must never be administered by bolus intravenous injection, as this is associated with cardiotoxicity. The loading dose is given strictly according to body weight.

The pharmacokinetic properties of quinine are altered considerably in malaria with a contraction in the volume of distribution and a reduction in clearance that is proportional to the severity of disease (19). There is significant binding of quinine to acute phase reactants, notably glycoprotein, with reduction in the levels of free quinine. Quinine toxicity is, therefore, relatively uncommon (20). The most frequent side effect of quinine therapy is hypoglycaemia, especially in children and pregnant women (19, 21) . Although quinine may prolong the QTc-interval, hypotension, heart block, and ventricular arrhythmias are rare (4, 19, 22) . Convulsions and visual disturbances have been reported as idiosyncratic responses or with overdosage (4,19). Doses should be reduced by 30-50% after the third day of treatment to avoid accumulation of the drug in patients who remain seriously ill, especially those with evidence of renal failure (4). The measurement of levels of free (not total) quinine may be helpful in patients with severe malaria and renal failure, but accessibility to this test is very limited.

A serum creatinine of greater than 256 or a rapidly rising creatinine and/or a urine output of < 400 ml/day in an adult should be regarded as renal failure. A central venous catheter (CVP) should be inserted and dehydration should be corrected. The CVP should not be above 5cm of water. The indications for dialysis are the same as for patients with other diseases, but since renal failure in malaria occurs against a background of a hypercatabolic state and non-renal causes of acidosis frequently co-exist, early dialysis is recommended (37). Venovenous haemofiltration is the recommended mode of dialysis and is significantly more efficient than peritoneal dialysis (38).",

There were significant problems with the comparability of treatment groups in the studies reviewed, with higher levels of parasitaemia and more severe malaria in the group who received transfusions (51).
