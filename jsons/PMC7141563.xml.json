            "text": "The functional role of CD13 varies depending on its location. Often, other membrane peptidases such as CD10 or CD26 co-localize with CD13 and seem to cooperate in peptide degradation. In the intestinal brush border, CD13 as well as CD10 or CD26 are involved in the terminal degradation of small peptides and in amino acid scavenging15 (in this location 6\u20138% of the protein is CD13). In synaptic membranes, CD13 and CD10 (enkephalinase) inactivate endorphins and enkephalins16. Furthermore, like CD26 (17, 18), CD13 has been considered an auxiliary adhesion molecule. When melanoma cells form colonies, the majority of CD13 molecules relocate to sites of cell\u2013cell contact; in those cells CD13 seems to be tightly associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) components19. Whereas CD26 is involved in the adherence of metastatic breast and prostate carcinoma cells to lung endothelium20, CD13 mediates migration of different human metastatic tumor cell lines through matrigel19, 21. Recently, CD13 was shown to be the major receptor for the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (Ref. 22) that causes a severe gastroenteritis in piglets, and for the human coronavirus 229E (Ref. 23) that causes upper respiratory infections. TGEV binds to a region between residues 717 and 813 that lies within the C-terminal domain22; the peptidase activity of CD13 appears not to be involved in virus binding, which is in accordance with the position of the active site located in the N-terminal domain (see Fig. 1).",

Interestingly, natural peptides such as bradykinin or substance P inhibit the enzyme in micromolar concentrations24, but as yet there are no reports of regulatory circuits involving these two peptides that otherwise are good substrates for CD10. The first insights into CD13 expression suggest that it is regulated by a variety of different mechanisms. In addition to developmentally regulated expression, preliminary studies suggest a varying expression of CD13 during cell-growth and differentiation. For example, maturation and differentiation of monocytes is accompanied by increasing CD13 expression25. Furthermore, T-cell-derived cytokines such as interleukin 4 (IL-4) and interferon \u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) can upregulate CD13 mRNA and protein as well as enzyme activity in monocytes/macrophages, endothelial cells and renal tubular epithelial cells26, 27, with a maximum achieved after 2\u20133 days. In a variety of cells, the levels of CD13 protein and enzyme activity correlate with the abundance of CD13 transcripts.",

In epithelial cells, transcription is controlled by a classical promoter containing a TATA box upstream from the translation initiation codon. By contrast, myeloid cell and fibroblast transcripts originate from multiple sites clustered in an upstream exon located 8 kb from the exon containing the initiator codon. The two promoter regions differ with respect to transcription factor binding sites, but the encoded proteins are believed to be structurally identical. Myb and Ets are transacting factors for the myeloid promoter and cooperate with the transcription factors CBP/p300 and c-Maf (30, 31).",

The time course of CD13 expression on lymphocytes is rapid and differs from the well-described temporal characteristics of an increase in CD13 expression on monocytes and renal tubular epithelial cells elicited by IL-4. Exposure of tonsillar T and B cells to synoviocytes for as little as 1 h is sufficient to induce the expression of CD13 on the lymphocytes, and peak levels of CD13 mRNA expression persist for up to 16 h. Mitogens enhance lymphocytic CD13 expression when co-cultured with different adherent cells. Direct cell\u2013cell contact between lymphocytes and adherent cells is required for CD13 induction on lymphocytes in vitro. Neither soluble APN from human kidney nor ECM proteins can induce lymphocytic CD13 expression. Furthermore, recent data point to a role for CD13 on adherent cells in the induction of CD13 on lymphocytes; cell\u2013cell contact with CD13+ cells such as the transformed endothelial cell line ECV304 does not result in lymphocytic CD13 expression. Similarly, ECV304 cells transfected with an expression vector for soluble APN (enzyme lacking its membrane anchor) are insufficient, whereas ECV cells transfected with a CD13 expression vector and sorted for CD13+ cells can induce CD13 expression on lymphocytes36. Peripheral blood lymphocytes allowed to migrate into a three-dimensional collagen lattice with synoviocytes, are another good example of cell\u2013cell contact induced expression of lymphocytic CD13 (Fig. 2\n).",

The compiled results not only show induction of peptidases, but also downregulation; for example, CD13 expression on early B-lineage ALL cells is decreased after contact with bone marrow stromal cells37. Stromal-cell-mediated suppression of CD13 on B cells requires direct contact, is due to inhibition of gene transcription and is reversed by removing cells from stroma. Lymphocytes are not only cells that are responsive to signals from stromal cells, but can themselves induce upregulation of proteolytic activity in monocytes and fibroblasts45. Furthermore, direct cell\u2013cell contact has not been found as an inevitable precondition in all cases; for example, bone marrow stromal cells positive for APA (BP-1/6C3) rapidly and selectively induce APA expression on B-cell precursors coincident with their growth. As a soluble factor, IL-7 can partially mimic the effect, inducing both APA expression as well as proliferation of B-cell precursors40.",

Cell\u2013cell contact can also upregulate membrane peptidases outside the hematopoietic system. As one example, CD13 expression in microglia is upregulated by culture of microglia on astrocytes48. In addition, ECM structures might be involved in cell\u2013cell-contact-dependent regulation of proteases, as there are proteases that are obviously regulated by contact with ECM structures alone, such as tissue factor induced in the myeloid cell line THP-1 after culture on fibronectin49.",

Thymic stromal cells that bind double-positive (CD4+CD8+) thymocytes exhibit strong activity of CD13 and CD10 (Ref. 50), and in fetal thymus organ cultures a delayed thymocyte maturation has been observed after inhibition of CD10 (Ref. 51) and after inhibition of aminopeptidases with bestatin52.",

Until now, however, no physiological peptide substrates of membrane peptidases such as CD13, CD10 or APA have been clearly implicated in the regulation of growth or maturation of lymphatic precursors. It has been proposed that a point of convergence between adhesion and peptidase substrates could be cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase focal adhesion kinase (p125FAK), which is activated and autophosphorylated both by ligation of integrins as well as by peptidase substrates that act through G-protein-coupled receptors (such as bombesin-related peptide substrates for CD10)53. Focal adhesion kinase can associate with Src or PI 3-kinase, or both, leading to activation of several signaling pathways. Many integrin-triggered reactions, for example activation of protein tyrosine kinases, such as pp60src, pp125fak and pp72syk are shared with signals generated by more traditional agonist receptors, such as those for growth factors and cytokines (reviewed in Ref. 54). Receptors for growth factors or cytokines could partition into complexes assembled by integrins, and in these complexes they might become activated and signal more efficiently.",

Tonsillar B cells cultured over confluent monolayers of synoviocytes secrete high levels of immunoglobulins and differentiate into plasma cells after 8\u201312 days57. CD13, CD10 and CD26 were shown to be co-localized on the cell surface of synovial cells, with identical profiles in cells derived from rheumatoid and osteoarthritic joints58. It has been claimed that the fibroblastic synovial cells are a potent source of peptide-degrading activities in the joint: with (1) CD10 responsible for metabolism of bradykinin; (2) CD13 and CD10 acting together as Leu-enkephalin degrading enzymes; and (3) CD10 and CD26 inactivating substance P (Ref. 58). The finding that anti-CD13 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can inhibit the increased IL-6 production observed after co-culture of blood monocytes and synoviocytes59 points to a more extended role of CD13 in cell\u2013cell contacts within the inflamed joint. Together with membrane peptidases on synoviocytes, we propose an important role for lymphocytic peptidases in joint inflammatory processes. In addition, we suggest that cell\u2013cell contact between lymphocytes and synoviocytes acts as a regulatory event in their expression.",

            "text": "The observation that contact with different stromal cells induces CD13 expression on lymphocytes can explain the occurrence of CD13+ lymphocytes in various locations, which might be of physiological relevance. In the immune system, ectopeptidases can exert such diverse functions as signal transduction across the cell membrane, and regulation of the concentration of bioactive peptides and of cellular adhesion. However, in comparison with CD26, which is much better characterized with respect to its possible involvement in immune functions (reviewed in 60, 61), there are only very few experiments proving such functions for CD13. For example, CD13 has been implicated in the trimming on the cell surface of peptides that protrude out of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules62. Pool sequencing experiments of natural HLA-DR,-DQ and -DP ligands revealed a highly dominant proline at position 2 (Ref. 63), supporting a role for CD13-like activity in antigen processing. T cells with a bright expression of CD26 have been found to preferentially migrate through a monolayer of endothelial cells on collagen gels64. Similarly, a CD13-mediated adhesion to cells and ECM structures could be a common mechanism shared by various motile cells. Furthermore, lymphocytic expression of CD13 represents an increased cellular potential for inactivation of inflammatory mediators, as shown for the degradation of enkephalins by rat splenocytes65. Hence, CD13 could play a specific role in the control of the communication between the neuroendocrine and the immune system. CD13 or CD26, either tested separately or in combination, were not able to degrade rIL-1\u03b1, rIL-2, recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rG-CSF) or natural IL-2 despite the presence of susceptible N-terminal peptide sequences66. Nevertheless, recent studies show that chemokines are substrates for CD26 (67, 72, 73, 74). Processing of the CC chemokine RANTES by CD26 changes specificity of receptor and of target cells67, 72. With respect to this finding, the one report describing degradation as well as inactivation of the CXC chemokine IL-8 by CD13 (Ref. 68) acquires special importance. Cell\u2013cell contact is a potent stimulus for chemokine secretion69. Hence, the question arises: are there common mechanisms in cell\u2013cell contact that cause secretion of IL-8 and induction of its inactivator CD13? Furthermore, chemokines, similar to neuropeptides, signal with G-protein-coupled receptors, with the involvement of the aforementioned focal adhesion kinase (see as example Ref. 70), leading to the potential for common regulations in the immuno-neuroendocrine axis.",

An increased understanding of the function of individual CD13+ cells in controlling the level of peptide growth factors and their effects on cellular neighbours might throw light on specific peptide-mediated intercellular interactions in complex tissues.
