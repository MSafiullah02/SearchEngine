Unfortunately, it is still raging with no effective drugs clinically approved. Given the severity of SARS-COV-2, it is critical to discovery and clinical application of specific drugs against SARS-COV-2 to alleviate the current epidemic situation. It is particularly important to screen possible blockers for the potential target proteins of virus by computational chemical biology techniques such as molecular docking (\u201cdry method\u201dresearch) in special cases such as the outbreak of SARS-COV-2 (Li et al., 2020). This approach conducive to large-scale screening in a short period of time. It has been recommended two main proteins, 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), could be used as available targets for screening drugs that inhibiting the replication and proliferation of SARS-COV-2, benefit from rapid sequencing of SARS-COV-2 coupled with molecular modelling based on the genomes of related viral proteins (Chen et al., 2020; Chai et al., 2020).",

            "text": "Chinese Medicines (CMs), a long history system of medicine with distinct features of theories and practices, has been used for thousands of years (Qiu, 2015). CMs prescriptions embody the principles of system theory, and act on multiple cellular targets in multiple pathways to exert therapeutic effects (Hou et al., 2016; Liao et al., 2018). COVID-19 belongs to the category of pestilence or epidemic in CM (Luo et al., 2019). CMs had been used to treat and prevent viral infection pneumonia diseases for thousands of years and had accumulated a large number of clinical experience and effective prescription (Luo et al., 2020). In the \u201cDiagnosis and Treatment Program for Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\u201d issued by the National Health Commission of China, it is recommended to treat with CMs and had achieved good clinical effects. Thus, it is very significant to explore and mine experiences of CMs in treating of pestilence or epidemic diseases based on the abundant historical classics of CMs combined with modern medical research method. In the present study, data mining and association network were used to mine the high-frequency CMs and formulas from ancient prescriptions. Furthermore, molecular docking approach were used to explore binding rates between the main ingredients in high frequency CMs and the key targets of SARS-COV-2. Then, we preliminarily uncover molecular mechanism by a network pharmacology process. These results are expected to provide referenced candidate CMs formulas or active compounds to overcome COVID-19.",

Support value was the percentage of preconditions that were true and used to measure universality; Confidence value was the percentage of preconditions for which records and the conclusions were both true, mainly used for measuring accuracy; Promotion value was used to evaluate the degree to which the appearance of one item set increased the appearance of another (Zhan and Fu, 2016).

In our study, the prescriptions for treatment of pestilence or epidemic diseases were mined from Dictionary of Traditional Chinese Medicine Prescriptions. 574 prescriptions were selected for the treatment of \u201cWenbing\u201d, \u201cWenyi\u201d, \u201cYibing\u201d or \u201cShiyi\u201d. The age distribution of prescriptions showed that the use of CMs to prevent epidemics could be traced back to Jin dynasty (Fig. 5\n). The selected prescriptions were mainly distributed in the Song, Ming and Qing dynasties, especially the Qing dynasty with 325 kinds of prescriptions. It was estimated that it may be due to the academic development of Seasonal Febrile Disease after the Ming dynasty. Dr. Wu Youke from Ming dynasty proposed the etiological theory of \u201cliqi\u201d for the first time, which mean the evil epidemic pathogenic factors in Wen Yi Lun (Wu, 1991). Wu emphasized that Wen diseases (pestilence) was totally different from febrile disease and clearly pointed out that \u201cThe wenyi was a disease, not feng(wind), han(cold), shu(heat) or shi(damp), but a strange feeling between heaven and earth\u201d. In addition, Wu established the thinking mode of syndrome differentiation and created the effective prescription named \u201cDayuanyin\u201d for treating pestilence diseases. While during the formation of Seasonal Febrile Disease school in the Qing Dynasty, febrile pathologists such as Ye Gui, Wu Jiao, Wang Shixiong and Xue Shengbai not only put forward the academic opinions of Wei Qi Ying Xue from Wen Bing Lun (Yue et al., 2017), Differentiation of Triple Energizer from Wen Bing Tiao Bian (Wu, 1972).

An integrated in silico approach was introduced to identify the target proteins for the active compounds of CMs (Fu et al., 2017). We totally obtained 286 potential therapeutic targets for 119 kinds of candidate compounds from Gancao (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma) and HuangQin (Scutellariae Radix).

Among them, 40 kinds of high frequency CMs, 36 high-frequency CMs-pairs and 6 kinds of high-frequency triple-CM-groups were mined by frequency analysis method were used to analyze the collected prescriptions. Among the commonly used CMs beneficial for antiviral, Gancao (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma) and HuangQin (Scutellariae Radix) were given high priority CM pairs for selection used in CM prescriptions against pestilence by mining the compatibility rules of prescriptions with association rules analyses. The molecular docking results implied that 66 compounds in 26 kinds of CMs probably show a potential anti-SARS-COV-2 activity by binding with the ACE2 and 3CL hydrolase. It's worth noting that Gancao (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma) contained the most potential compounds of 20, followed by HuangQin (Scutellariae Radix). Meanwhile, based on network-based computational methods, an integrated system pharmacology approach was used to predict targets, construct networks, and explore the molecular action of high-frequency Gancao (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma) and HuangQin (Scutellariae Radix) (GH) CMs-pair. In present study, 85 and 34 kinds of active ingredients with favorable bioactivities and contents were selected from Gancao (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma) and HuangQin (Scutellariae Radix) by ADME filtering, providing some foundational clues for thorough investigation on this CMs-pair. By analyzing the network topology of targets, 30 kinds of important targets were identified. By using network systematic analysis, GH CMs-pair could regulate the proteins related to immune system, inflammation, cellular processes, and endocrine system. COVID-19 leads to a strong immune response and inflammatory storm, in which a large number of cytokines are activated. GH CMs-pair may regulate the immune-related pathway Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, T-cell and B-cell receptor signaling pathway, as well as cytokine action related pathways such as TNF signaling pathway, NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway signaling pathway to inhibit the activated cytokines, relieve the excessive immune response and eliminate inflammation. From perspective of molecular network, GH CMs-pair exerted overall regulation through multi-ingredient and multi-target synergistic effect.",
