Such as in other Italian districts with the highest peaks of COVID-19 incidence, our endoscopy service was centralized to our referral hospital in order to improve the response to the increasing number of COVID-19 admissions, reducing the district workload. In a rapid progression, our local healthcare system was challenged to the maximum level, threatening our ability to offer adequate care. We were forced to deal with these challenges through emergency brainstorming sessions, acting as a united medical-surgical community in order to define our action plan that was based on a practical strategy, reorganizing the hospital pathways of emergency endoscopy in order to avoid virus dissemination. We report our experience with emergency endoscopies in the COVID-19 era; the goal was to sustain a full emergency endoscopic capability despite the hospital overload due to SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.",

We would like for our readers to hear about experiences in regions in which the virus was particularly ferocious, such as in Northern Italy as reported by our colleagues Augusto Lauro et al., who provide a fascinating first-hand report of the planning, hard work, courage, skill, and dedication that provided needed endoscopic services to an epicenter of viral activity without infecting additional patients or caregivers.",

            "text": "* A. Lauro augustola@yahoo.com 1 Emergency Surgery and GI Department, St. Orsola University Hospital, Bologna, Italy endoscopic examination. Personal protective equipment (PPE) such as double gloves, filtering facepiece respirators (FFP2 or FFP3), water-resistant gowns, goggles, and shoe covers [8] was available inside the department, with attention placed on their safe disposal. In order to avoid the spread of virus among hospital personnel, we strictly regulated entry and exit into operating rooms and endoscopy suites. The minimum staff level (strictly necessary to perform urgent or unpostponable procedures) attended the department, and in order to minimize risks and the overuse of PPE, students together with trainees and other caregivers were not allowed to access the suite [9] . To preserve service continuity, concomitant exposure of staff with specialist skills was avoided [10] . Eventually, a strategy that entirely separated patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 from those who were not infected was clearly identified [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . In our hospital, urgent endoscopies were carried out routinely from 08:00 to 20:00 in the endoscopy suite, whereas overnight they are performed in the ED. If the patient is in critical condition or requiring anesthetic assistance, the procedures are carried out in the operating room. During the virus outbreak, the ED was crowded with SARS-CoV-2-positive patients making it impossible to use any room for urgent endoscopy. For this reason, during the nightshift, the procedures were all performed in the operating room. Emergency endoscopy procedures were due to life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding, foreign body ingestion, food bolus impaction, intestinal obstruction, caustic ingestion, and ascending cholangitis as reported in Table 1 . From February 28 to April 5, 2020, 38 urgent endoscopic procedures on adult patients were carried out, 31 (81%) upper endoscopies and 7 (19%) performed in the lower gastrointestinal tract. In 29 (76%) patients, the indication was digestive bleeding diagnosed/treated by 23 EGDs and 6 colonoscopies. Among these procedures, 21(72%) were carried out in the endoscopy suite and 8 (28%) in the operating room. There were two foreign body removals, both performed in the operating room and two procedures due to caustic ingestion performed in the endoscopic suite. One intestinal obstruction and four patients with acute cholangitis were treated with endoscopic stenting and endoscopic drainage in the endoscopic suite. In one SARS-CoV-2-positive patient treated by ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), EGD and colonoscopy were performed at the bedside; the patient suffered from diffuse mucosal bleeding due to acute gastritis and ileal hemorrhage without discrete bleeding sites, likely due to the anticoagulation. Thus far, we have not had any documented cases SARS-CoV-2 infections of patients or caregivers related to our endoscopic procedures. In order to evaluate our performance in this demanding setting, we compared these data to those obtained by our group in the same period of time in 2019 ( Table 1 ). At that time, we performed 40 urgent endoscopic procedures, 32 (80%) upper endoscopies and 8 (20%) related to the lower gastrointestinal tract. In 30 patients (75%), the indication was GI tract hemorrhage diagnosed/treated with 24 EGDs and 6 colonoscopies. Among these procedures, 27 (90%) were carried out in the endoscopy suite and 3 (10%) in the operating room. There was an EGD performed for food bolus obstruction performed in the endoscopy suite. Two intestinal obstructions were treated by endoscopic stenting in the endoscopy suite, whereas seven endoscopic drainages (and stenting when needed) were performed on patients affected by cholangitis. Among these procedures, five ERCPs were performed in the endoscopy suite and two in the operating room.",

The creation of a dedicated route for SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, the institution of adequate training procedures with appropriate instructions to the staff, and a proper policy of PPE use (10) avoided the risk of spreading the virus among patients and operators. As pointed out earlier, at present there is no documented transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infections to patients or caregivers attributable to our emergency endoscopies. Moreover, an important key point is the activity of trainees during the pandemic. In our hospital, trainees are essential to the management of the burden among patients infected by SARS-CoV-2, but, regarding endoscopy, our policy was to stop training in the urgent endoscopy suite in order to reduce the numbers of inside operators and their use of PPE. Due to the global pandemic, a reorganization of the emergency endoscopy service should be considered by all hospitals, based on efficient teamwork and cross-specialty collaboration, with a clearly delineated priority hierarchy for urgent procedures that are performed in a region according to a \"hub-and-spoke\" strategy due to the reduced number of staff members and the limited availability of hospital beds, endoscopy suites, operating rooms, and resources.",
