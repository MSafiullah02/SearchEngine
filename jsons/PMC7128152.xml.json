            "text": "Several achievements have been made during the last decade enabling the sensitive detection and characterization of viral nucleic acids. Amplification technologies, like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) make the amplification of in principle any target of interest, possible. Furthermore, technological improvements in sequence detection systems enable the fully characterization of a virus, and to determine for instance the subtype, genotype, variants, mutants, and genotypic resistance patterns. The implementation of nucleic acid technology into routine diagnostics has made a great step forward with the introduction of real time technologies, which makes the detection of amplified products relatively easy (Niesters, 2001, Mackay et al., 2002). Furthermore, this technology is able to quantify target nucleic acids in a single sample over a larger dynamic range than most other quantitative technologies, although qualitative detection is of course also possible. Since both amplification and detection can currently be performed automatically, the most labor intensive and critical step remaining is the efficient extraction of nucleic acids from different clinical samples.",

            "text": "The third bottleneck deals with standardization and quality control programs. It has been known since the early 1990s that one of the greatest hurdles to overcome in molecular technologies are false-positivity due to contamination, and false-negativity due to the great difference in sensitivity of in most cases, home-brew assays (Quint et al., 1995, Schuurman et al., 1996, Zaaijer et al., 1993). Furthermore, differences in detecting all genotypes equally of e.g. HIV-1 or hepatitis C virus (HCV) with the same amplification efficiency have also been reported (Damen et al., 1996, Zaaijer et al., 1994). Programs within Europe have been initiated and have indeed shown that there is a need for obtaining more standardized material and the need to participate in these programs (Valentine-Thon et al., 2001, van Vliet et al., 2001). A successor of one of these initiatives is called Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostics (QCMD; http://www.qcmd.org) endorsed by the European Society for Clinical Virology (ESCV) and the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Disease (ESCMID) which starts to provide these quality control programs for an increasing number of viral targets, whether commercially interesting or not. Asides the need for a well defined quality control program, there is still the lack of standardization of quantitative assays, mainly due to the fact that standardization is limited to a select number of blood borne viruses, like HIV-1, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HCV, for which internationally accepted World Health Organization (WHO) standards are made available (Saldanha et al., 1999, Saldanha et al., 2001). These standards are unfortunately only for a single viral genotype or subtype, and in most cases this is focused more specifically on blood bank screening and not for routine virological diagnostics. This lack of focus on standardization is one of the hurdles that need to be taken for the in-house developed assays for the \u2018non-commercially interesting\u2019 viral targets.",

            "text": "We have introduced the MagnaPure LC system (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany) in our laboratory as an open extraction system, initially for the extraction of RNA and DNA from serum and plasma. Combined with real time detection, whether TaqMan technology or NASBA amplification, this enabled us to automatically extract and subsequently detect both RNA and DNA over a large dynamic range in a single clinical sample. To monitor this extraction process for loss or inhibition, we introduced the use of a universally internal viral control, which consists of a complete DNA virus, the non-human seal herpes virus type 1 (PhHV-1). A real time and quantitative TaqMan assay was developed for this seal herpesvirus, which can be grown relatively easily in cell culture. Meanwhile, we also have introduced a universal RNA virus as an internal control, the Phocine distemper virus. The assumption is that a virus used as universal control behaves more similar in the extraction procedure as the target virus of interest, in contrast to using e.g. a plasmid as internal control. A low and fixed amount of this virus (equal to an amount giving a Ct value in the real time assay of approximately 30\u201333, depending on the lot number used) is added to each clinical sample (in our cases mostly serum or plasma) before the extraction procedure starts. This virus is co-extracted and subsequently amplified in a quantitative manner in a separate tube. This methodology enables to monitor the combined effect of extraction (loss of sample) and amplification (inhibition), and enables to be more confident on the quantitative results generated for the viral target of interest. Also negative results from clinical samples (\u2018no target detected\u2019) can therefore be generated with high confidence. The data from the internal control are routinely imported into a spreadsheet program, with defined thresholds to approve or disapprove the final results. A typical example is shown in Fig. 1\n. Currently, multiplexing of the clinical sample with the internal control is under development. This strategy enables us to monitor every new strategy, new equipment or technology for extraction very rapidly, or enables us to check whether different lot numbers of reagents behave identical (or not). Of course, the assumption is that the amplification efficiency for this universal internal control is within the range of the targets of interest.",

This does of course not exclude using real time technology to quantify viral targets, since this has shown to give invaluable information on how viruses and their host interact.",

Also, the availability of ready-to-go reagents for both (RT)-PCR and NASBA is a step forward. Numerous examples of detecting and quantification of viral targets have been published already and the list is growing rapidly (Niesters, 2001). In conclusion, the whole process from isolation up to detection can now be automated, however, for each target the optimal strategy still needs to be established. It has to be determined which threshold values do have clinical importance, or what detection levels need to be reached with this assay.",

A TaqMan based assay for the gene encoding the p143 BNRF protein has been developed and used to investigate the incidence of EBV reactivation and the development of EBV related PTLDs (Niesters et al., 2000, van Esser et al., 2001a, van Esser et al., 2001b, van Esser et al., 2002). Moreover, the assay was and is performed very frequently (between three and currently five times a week) enabling to determine the kinetics of EBV replication in our patient population. Several interesting conclusions could be drawn, one of them was that each 10-fold stepwise increase of EBV DNA measured in plasma, yielded a hazard ratio of 2.9 (95% confidence interval 1.7\u20134.8) for developing PTLD for those patients receiving a T-cell depleted graft (P<0.001). Furthermore, it was shown that those patients receiving anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) as part of their conditioning regimen belonged to the population with the highest risk, and not the T cell depletion itself. The question now was raised at what viral load one should intervene with a pre-emptive antiviral strategy, i.e. to precisely identify those patients at risk. A threshold of 1000 copies per ml in plasma was chosen to start treatment with Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against CD20, which is the receptor binding-site for EBV. Although this resulted in an over-treatment of patients who have an EBV reactivation and most likely would not develop EBV-PTLD, a reduction of EBV-PTLD incidence and a complete abrogation of PTLD-mortality at 6 months was observed (van Esser et al., 2002). An example of the kinetic pattern observed with EBV DNA measured in plasma is shown in Fig. 2\n. It can be observed that the EBV DNA viral load can increase very rapidly, making it necessary to perform the real time testing on a regular basis. Monitoring patients at risk, and follow up after the initiation of treatment frequently is thus necessary. An advantage of the isolation of nucleic acids using generic methods is that it also enables to detect several clinically important viruses simultaneously. Definitely in the growing population of immunocompromised patients, this strategy seems to be fruitful. Fig. 3\nshows the example of a simultaneous detection of the herpesviruses EBV and human cytomegalovirus (CMV) in a bone marrow transplant patient.",

It has been shown that for the blood borne viruses, the characterization of the virus is becoming more or less a routine practice in clinical virology. For HIV-1, the genotypic resistance pattern, usually obtained by sequencing both the reverse transcriptase and protease gene, generates a lot of information to enable optimal anti-retroviral therapy. This is done mostly in combination with the generation of quantitative RNA data. For the hepatitis C virus, the genotype is important, combined again with the viral load, for the determination of the duration of therapy using interferon and ribavirin (EASL, 1999). There are a number of technologies to achieve this, but sequencing is in principal the ultimate way of characterization. A disadvantage is that, during antiviral treatment, a mixture of both wild type and variant virus does co-exist. It has been observed that sequencing is not very suitable for the detection of minor populations of variant viruses (Schuurman et al., 1999). Other technologies as reverse hybridization (Stuyver et al., 1997, Stuyver et al., 2000, Pas et al., 2002) or restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis (Allen et al., 1999, Niesters et al., 2002) might be more suitable, but it should be clear that they are only successful if the sequence changes are known in a specific gene. Again, viral load measurements can be very supportive in searching for new variants.",

The development of a new RFLP analysis could determine the dynamics in which both wild type and variant sequences were present during and after antiviral therapy (Fig. 4\n). It has been estimated that there are approximately 300 million HBV chronic carriers worldwide. The measurement of HBV DNA in serum has become an important tool to identify individuals with high viral replication who might benefit from antiviral therapy, to monitor patients on therapy, and to predict whether antiviral therapy will be successful. The dynamic range in which HBV is detected in patients can be up to ten logs, which immediately implies that current commercially available technologies are unable to quantify without diluting or concentrating the sample. Real time amplification is thus definitely the technology to use (Pas et al., 2000). With the introduction of new antiviral drugs like Lamivudine {(\u2013) 2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxy-3\u2032-thiacytidine}, close monitoring of patients has become increasingly important due to the occurrence of viral resistant strains, or the presence of flares after withdrawal from antiviral therapy (Honkoop et al., 1995, Honkoop et al., 1997).",

Also for those viruses that can be cultured relatively easily, like e.g. HSV types 1 and 2 (Espy et al., 2000). These new molecular technologies do have several advantages, definitely in those settings in which routine virus culture is not available. However, it should also be noted that an improved sensitivity is observed in most instances. The implementation of molecular diagnostics into routine clinical diagnostic virology will proceed and could ultimately replace or reduce virus culture techniques. The implementation of automated extraction and detection technologies, combined with an extensive quality control program, should ultimately convince both clinicians and virologists that molecular diagnostics is a strong cornerstone in clinical virology. The final critical remark often mentioned that not all positive results should have a clinical significance, will be counter-parted by good clinical and epidemiological information, combined with quantitative information on one or more viruses present. However, the ability to exclude viral infections has the advantage that unnecessary therapeutic options are avoided, which inevitably will reduce overall costs for patient care. But we do need financial figures to prove this. Thus with an improved accuracy and sensitivity combined with a more rapid turn around time, these molecular technologies are important for clinical patient care providing information for the best therapeutic options.",
