Their role as causative agents of respiratory disease has been conclusively demonstrated for some of these (HMPV, SARS, NL63), but for others their classification as a respiratory pathogen remains highly speculative in the absence of fulfilling Koch's postulates. This is particularly so for the newly discovered human KIV and WUV.",

Similarly, by multiple sequence alignments of the predicted STAg, LTAg, VP1 and VP2 open reading frames, Gaynor et al. (2007) confirmed that WUV was clearly another novel polyomavirus that is most closely related to KIV.

Nucleic acids were extracted from 0.2 mL of each urine specimen with a QIAamp DNA blood mini kit (Qiagen, Clifton Hill, Australia).

A common PCR reaction mix was used for all conventional assays consisting of 1.25 units of QIAGEN HotStart Taq (Qiagen), 2.5 pmol of each primer, 0.625 \u03bcL of 10 mM dNTPs, 0.5 \u03bcL of 25 mM MgCl2, 2.5 \u03bcL of 10\u00d7 QIAGEN PCR buffer (Qiagen) and 2.5 \u03bcL of nucleotide extract made up to a 25 \u03bcL volume. Amplification was performed on an ABI GeneAmp 2700 instrument (Applied Biosystems Pty Ltd., Scoresby, Australia). For KIV, specimens were screened using primers POLVP1-39F and POLVP1-363R and positive results were confirmed with a second set of primers (POLVP1-118F and POLVP1-324R) as originally described by Allander et al. (2007). The KIV PCR assays utilized cycling conditions of 15 min incubation at 95 \u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, 54 \u00b0C for 30 s and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min, followed by a final extension of 10 min at 72 \u00b0C. WUV was initially detected by conventional PCR using primers AG0044 and AG0045, as described by Gaynor et al. (2007), utilizing 15 min incubation at 95 \u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, 56 \u00b0C for 30 s and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min, and a final extension of 10 min at 72 \u00b0C. PCR amplification products were realized by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. Positive results were confirmed using a WUV-specific real-time PCR assay, which was recently developed in our laboratory, incorporating a hydrolysis (TaqMan) probe (Bialasiewicz et al., 2007).",

Although both viruses had a consistent presence during 2003, there appeared to be no seasonal pattern of peak infection associated with KIV in our sample population. However, there appeared to be a predominance of infection with WUV in Queensland patients during the period from late winter to early summer, peaking in December (Fig. 1\n). The prevalence of WUV from August to December was 5.5% compared to an average incidence of 2.9% for the rest of the year. In contrast, the prevalence of KIV for this period was 2.9% compared to 2.5% for the remaining year. However, this distribution across different seasons proved not to be statistically significant for either virus. In this specimen set for 2003, complete annual prevalence data were only available for those respiratory viruses considered to be of most clinical significance.

Neither of the viruses were detected in other sample sets consisting of urine from a variety of sources, and blood from immunocompromised children. This was contrary to observations for the other human polyomaviruses BKV and JCV, which are commonly present in clinical urine samples and blood specimens, particularly from immunocompromised patients (Rossi et al., 2007, Polo et al., 2004, Azzi et al., 1996).
