            "text": "Malaria is a mosquito borne disease caused by parasites of the genus Plasmodium. The majority of the \u223c445 000 malaria related deaths in 2016 were caused by P. falciparum and occurred in sub-Saharan Africa (Murray et al. 2014; WHO 2017). In addition, P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale (comprised of two different subspecies; P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri (Sutherland et al. 2010)) and two zoonotic species, P. knowlesi and P. simium (Singh et al. 2004; Brasil et al. 2017), are recognised as significant contributors to global malaria disease burden. While intervention against Anopheles mosquito vectors and the success of artemisinin-based combination therapies have contributed to marked decreases in disease burden since the year 2000, there is growing concern regarding the spread of P. falciparum strains throughout Southeast Asia which are resistant to artemisinin-based drugs and their partner drugs utilized in combination therapies (Dondorp et al. 2009; Ariey et al. 2014; Ashley et al. 2014; Tun et al. 2015; Das et al. 2018). Resistance to other clinically used antimalarials, such as chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, is also widespread globally (Plowe et al. 1997; Trape et al. 1998; Mehlotra et al. 2001). Thus, there is an urgent need to bring to market new antimalarials with novel mechanisms of action which are active against all drug-resistant strains, effective against all human pathogenic Plasmodium spp. and can clear parasitemia rapidly for improved clinical outcomes (Burrows et al. 2017). Targeting multiple lifecycle stages would improve the effectiveness of combination therapies across endemic areas and help slow the development of drug resistance.",

After rapid multiplication of liver stage parasites, the mature hepatic schizont ruptures and releases red blood cell (RBC) invading merozoites into the blood stream. In the case of P. falciparum, after merozoite invasion of a RBC a 48 hour cycle of growth, multiplication, RBC rupture and release of 16\u201332 new merozoites ensues (reviewed in White et al. 2014). The number of merozoites produced per cycle of growth and the length of the blood stage lifecycle varies between human malaria species. A small portion of blood stage parasites (<1%) differentiate into sexual stage gametocytes, which are transmitted to Anopheles vectors during blood meal feeding (reviewed in Liu, Miao and Cui 2011).",

            "text": "As all malaria pathology is caused by blood stage parasites, and this is when infection is diagnosed and clinical symptoms occur, antimalarials used for treatment of clinical disease or clearance of parasitemia predominantly target this stage of the lifecycle. One emerging strategy to kill blood stage parasites is to target merozoite invasion of the RBC with antimalarials. RBC invasion is an extracellular step in the blood stage lifecycle which is essential for parasite proliferation. A model for the sequential process of invasion, from late stage merozoite development, priming of invasion ligands, merozoite release from the schizont (Fig. 1), through RBC contact and invasion (Fig. 2), is described: briefly (i) merozoites attach to the RBC, (ii) the apical tip of the egg-shaped merozoite contacts the RBC, (iii) invasion ligands from organelles situated at the apical tip (the rhoptry and micronemes) are secreted upon calcium signals and an irreversible interaction known as the tight junction is formed, (iv) the actin-myosin invasion motor engages, protease cleavage events are triggered as the RBC membrane is pulled around the parasite to form the parasitophorous vacuole and (v) the invasion pore is fused behind the invaded parasite (Dvorak et al. 1975; Gilson and Crabb 2009; Weiss et al. 2015). An important consideration in terms of drug-development is that RBC invasion requires a series of co-ordinated and often irreversible events to occur in sequence, with even small perturbations of this complex process likely to limit parasite survival in vivo.",

            "text": "RBC invasion is the essential first step in the disease causing blood stage of the lifecycle and the extracellular merozoite is exposed directly to the bloodstream. Vaccine development targeting merozoite invasion is well advanced with vaccines against merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1, Phase 2b; Genton et al. 2003; Ogutu et al. 2009), MSP2 (Phase 2b; Genton et al. 2003), apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1, Phase 2b; Thera et al. 2011), reticulocyte binding homologue 5 (Rh5, Phase 1a; Payne et al. 2017), erythrocyte binding antigen (EBA-175, Phase 1a; Koram et al. 2016) and others reaching clinical trials, but with limited efficacy demonstrated to date (reviewed in Draper et al. 2015; Beeson et al. 2016). However, many essential proteins and protein/protein interactions required for invasion are unique to malaria parasites and are highly conserved between isolates, making them strong targets for antimalarial development. Given this, there are several broad approaches that could be used therapeutically to block merozoite invasion. The importance of key parasite-parasite and parasite-RBC protein interactions on the merozoite surface highlights the possibility of blocking protein-protein interactions directly; potentially by targeting RBC receptor(s). In addition, protease cleavage events, calcium signalling, the action of the invasion motor and structural changes are also key processes in RBC invasion which could be targeted by drugs. Importantly, a drug that blocks a merozoite's ability to invade immediately and permanently ends the parasite's lifecycle, with this cidal activity potentially having benefits in terms of reducing the risk of tolerance leading to resistance and removing the parasites ability to transition to mosquito transmissible gametocytes. However, it has only been in recent years that protocols have been developed to test invasion-inhibitory compounds against P. falciparum merozoites directly in vitro), with the availability of these techniques now allowing improved screening and characterisation of new invasion-inhibitory chemotypes.",

Targeting RBC invasion has been established as a proof-of-concept through the demonstration of potent inhibitory activity of numerous compounds in vitro (summarised in Supplementary Table S1) and through several in vivo studies using animal models (Xiao et al. 1996; Zenonos et al. 2015; Nasamu et al. 2017; Pino et al. 2017). Numerous chemical starting points and targets have been identified that could be the basis for the development of potent inhibitors for therapeutic use, as described below. We compare this concept to the clinical use of inhibitors which block HIV entry into host cells (Barre-Sinoussi et al. 1983; Gallo et al. 1983) to demonstrate that RBC invasion is a viable therapeutic target. In addition, we consider studies from the related apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, for which a number of optimisable inhibitors have been developed against targets analogous to proteins in malaria parasites. As resistance to frontline artemisinin-based combination therapies continues to spread (Dondorp et al. 2009; Ariey et al. 2014; Ashley et al. 2014), this review is a timely reminder that malaria invasion of RBCs provides an \u2018Achilles heel\u2019 within the parasite's lifecycle that is of increasing interest for antimalarial development.",

Similar to malaria RBC invasion, HIV cell-entry is orchestrated by a multi-step process and is completed within a fraction of the total viral generation time (defined as time between virion release, infection of a new host cell and generation of daughter viral particles (excluding viral latency), estimated between 48 and 63 hours (2.0\u20132.6 days) (Dixit et al. 2004; Murray, Kelleher and Cooper 2011; Puller, Neher and Albert 2017)). Host cell entry begins with virion attachment, binding to the host's co-receptor and entry; with inhibitors, both clinically approved and in development, identified to target each step (reviewed in Kuritzkes 2009; Henrich and Kuritzkes 2013). Maraviroc, the first licenced chemokine receptor antagonist and first host targeting antiretroviral drug, specifically inhibits entry of HIV isolates by binding to the host cell receptor, C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5), one of two chemokine receptors that HIV viruses use for entry into the cell (Dorr et al. 2005; Wood and Armour 2005). Maraviroc specifically inhibits the entry of CCR5-tropic (R5) viruses and is routinely used in second-line antiretroviral combination therapies against R5 HIV viruses (reviewed in Perry 2010).",

Enfuvirtide, the first antiretroviral fusion-inhibitor approved for HIV treatment, is a 36-amino acid synthetic peptide that mimics the HR2 region of gp41 that binds to HR1, preventing the formation of the six-helix gp41 bundle that is critical for viral fusion and entry (Kilby et al. 1998).

A diversity of other sulfated carbohydrates and heparin-like-molecules (HLMs) have also been identified to inhibit invasion of P. falciparum merozoites, including curdlan sulfate (Havlik, Rovelli and Kaneko 1994; Evans et al. 1998), polyvinyl-sulfonate sodium salt (Kisilevsky et al. 2002), suramin (Fleck et al. 2003), carrageenans (Adams et al. 2005), sulfated cyclodextrins (Crandall et al. 2007), fucosylated chondroitin sulfate (Bastos et al. 2014), K5 polysaccharides (Boyle et al. 2010), inulin sulfate, xylan sulfate, tragacanth sulfate and scleroglucan sulfate (Boyle et al. 2017). Furthermore, HLM invasion-inhibitory activity has also been reported for the zoonotic malaria parasite P. knowlesi (Lyth et al. 2018) and P. berghei (Xiao et al. 1996), indicating that pan-species invasion inhibition of human malaria parasites is achievable with these molecules. Although precise mechanisms of action for sulfated carbohydrates in inhibiting invasion are not fully understood, HLMs have been reported to inhibit the earliest step in invasion, initial RBC attachment, and to bind MSP1 (Boyle et al. 2010), as well as to rhoptry and microneme proteins involved in reorientation and signalling steps of invasion (Fig. 2a-c) (Baum et al. 2009; Kobayashi et al. 2010; Kobayashi et al. 2013). Therefore, it is likely that these compounds target multiple essential ligands in the invasion process, thus reducing the potential for developing drug resistance. Indeed, attempts to generate heparin resistant parasite strains in vitro have been unsuccessful (Boyle et al. 2010). Although limited studies have been performed to evaluate the activity of HLMs in vivo, there is data from animal models (Xiao et al. 1996) and human clinical trials supporting their potential development (Havlik et al. 2005; Leitgeb et al. 2017).",

            "text": "Heparin has been historically used as an adjunct treatment for disseminated intravascular coagulation that can occur in severe malaria (Smitskamp and Wolthuis 1971; Munir et al. 1980; Rampengan 1991), but its use was stopped because its anticoagulative properties led to an increased risk of bleeding. Recently, heparins with periodate oxidation of non-sulfated uronic acid residues that greatly reduced anticoagulation activity of heparin (Pisano et al. 2005) were shown to be highly inhibitory to RBC invasion (Boyle et al. 2017). Similar HLMs have been tested for inhibition of lung cancer growth in mice with no anticoagulation activity reported across a range of tissue (Yu et al. 2010). Of further promise, curdlan sulfate (Boyle et al. 2010) has a 10-fold reduced anticoagulative activity and testing in a small human trial suggested that treatment reduced malaria disease severity (Havlik et al. 2005). A recent phase I clinical trial of the non-anticoagulant HLM sevuparin, a negatively charged polysaccharide manufactured from heparin, limited parasite replication by blocking invasion (Leitgeb et al. 2017). HLMs such as sevuparin also disrupt pathogenic mediators such as rosetting and sequestration of infected RBCs, (Udomsangpetch et al. 1989; Carlson et al. 1992; Rowe et al. 1994; Barragan et al. 1999; Vogt et al. 2006; Kyriacou et al. 2007; Skidmore et al. 2008; Bastos et al. 2014; Saiwaew et al. 2017), potentially enabling HLMs to provide dual protective mechanisms of action against severe malaria. Current HLMs that have been identified with antimalarial activity have relatively low potency (Boyle et al. 2017) and they have also been reported to have relatively short half-lives when used clinically (i.e. heparin < 1 hour (Perry, Herron and King 1974), sevuparin \u223c1 hour (Leitgeb et al. 2017), curdlan sulfate \u223c2\u20133 hours (Gordon et al. 1994)). However, the clinically used HLM fondaparinux has a longer half-life (17\u201321 hours)(Donat et al. 2002). Work on improving oral availability of heparin derivatives (reviewed in Neves et al. 2016), as well as prolonging HLM drug activity and potency (Hoffart et al. 2006; Boyle et al. 2017) are ongoing and offer an avenue for HLMs to be developed as antimalarials with invasion-inhibitory activity.",

These interactions are mediated by glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI) anchored proteins present on the merozoite's surface (Holder et al. 1992; Gilson et al. 2006). MSP1 is the most abundant GPI anchored protein on the merozoite surface (Gilson et al. 2006) and the proteolytic cleavage of MSP1 to 83 kDa, 30 kDa, 38 kDa and 42 kDa fragments is essential for RBC invasion (Blackman and Holder 1992). The N-terminal MSP1\u201383 fragment binds to the RBC receptor glycophorin A and the C-terminal MSP1\u201342 fragment has a role in binding to band-3 on the RBC surface. (Baldwin et al. 2015).",

Testing of EGF domain inhibitors with anticancer properties against MSP1\u201319 identified a small-molecule glycan mimetic, 2-butyl-5-chloro-3-(4-nitro-benzyl)-3H-imidazole-4-carbaldehyde (NIC), as a specific inhibitor of MSP1\u201319 function and parasite invasion (Fig. 2b, c) (Chandramohanadas et al. 2014). The invasion-inhibitory activity of NIC was confirmed using live filming of invasion and through the use of purified merozoites. NIC not only inhibited the growth of P. falciparum isolates, it also inhibited P. falciparum expressing P. chabaudi rodent malaria MSP1\u201319 and P. vivax field isolates, with IC50s \u223c20 \u03bcM; indicating the pan-species potential of these molecules against malaria parasite invasion. The authors highlight the possibility of targeting the EGF domain of MSP1\u201319 using small molecule glycans that are being developed as anti-cancer agents (Fig. 2b) (Sugahara et al. 2012), but to date no examples of this have been published and further development of this strategy would be required before clinical applications could be assessed. A potential advantage of developing inhibitors that target MSPs, such as HLMs and glycan mimetics, is that they can target merozoites throughout their extracellular phase; post release from schizonts through to resealing of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane.",

This tight junction is formed as a result of AMA1 (secreted from the micronemes) binding to the RBC bound rhoptry neck (RON) 2/4/5 (secreted from the rhoptries) protein complex (Alexander et al. 2006; Collins et al. 2009; Richard et al. 2010; Tonkin et al. 2011), with a known high affinity interaction demonstrated between AMA1 and RON2 (Srinivasan et al. 2011; Tonkin et al. 2011). The essential interaction between AMA1 and RON2 has been targeted by vaccine induced antibodies (Hodder, Crewther and Anders 2001; Kennedy et al. 2002), inhibitory peptides (Harris et al. 2005) and drug development (reviewed in Devine et al. 2017) (Fig. 2d). A phase 2b vaccine trial of children in Mali demonstrated high anti-AMA1 antibody titres and protection against clinical malaria caused by parasites harbouring vaccine-like alleles after 6 months, but there was minimal efficacy against clinical malaria overall, highlighting the difficulties with targeting a polymorphic antigen such as AMA1 (Thera et al. 2011). However, recent studies report substantial conservation of AMA1 function between species, providing evidence that generating cross-species inhibitory activity may be possible (Drew et al. 2018).",

The 20-amino acid R1 peptide, identified from a random phage display library (Harris et al. 2005), exhibits high binding affinity for the 3D7 parasite line AMA1/RON2 complex (KD50 \u223c0.2 \u03bcM) (Harris et al. 2005). RON2L mimics a conserved peptide region of RON2 and competes with native RON2 for the hydrophobic binding pocket of AMA1, blocking formation of the tight junction and inhibiting RBC invasion (Srinivasan et al. 2011). Making use of the high binding affinity of peptides that block AMA1/RON2 interactions, a RON2L(peptide)/AMA1 binding inhibition assay was used to screen 21 733 small-molecule inhibitors for activity against AMA1/RON2 (Srinivasan et al. 2013), with three hits suggested to directly inhibit RBC invasion. Modification of the lead compound, NCHC00015280 (a pyrrolopyrimidine; IC50 30 \u03bcM), yielded two analogues that showed a three (9.8 \u03bcM) and five (6 \u03bcM) fold improvement in invasion inhibition (Srinivasan et al. 2013). However, subsequent studies failed to show binding of these compounds to AMA1 with an affinity commensurate with their reported growth inhibitory activity (Devine et al. 2014; Pihan et al. 2015), leading Devine et al.(2014) to conclude that these compounds inhibited invasion through an AMA1/RON2 independent manner. Nevertheless, the essential role of the AMA1/RON2 complex for invasion, the availability of complete protein structures for in silico screening and optimisation makes inhibitors of AMA1/RON2 complex function an attractive target for further development.",

Latrunculins bind to actin's monomeric form (G-actin) near the Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) binding site and prevent polymerisation to filamentous actin (F-actin). A recent study identified key amino acid differences between human and Plasmodium spp. actin within the ATP binding pocket and sought to synthesise truncated latrunculin B analogues with improved activity against P. falciparum malaria and reduced toxicity against mammalian cells (Johnson et al. 2016). Truncated latrunculin analogues achieved a 6-fold improved potency against in vitro parasite growth (to 7 \u03bcM) and 17-fold higher selectivity over mammalian cell cytotoxicity (Johnson et al. 2016). To address whether these analogues had activity directly against parasite invasion, the authors used T. gondii invasion inhibition assays since this related apicomplexan parasite shares an identical amino acid sequence around the actin ATP binding pocket as P. falciparum (Johnson et al. 2016). Lead latrunculin analogues showed a >5-fold improvement in invasion-inhibitory activity against T. gondii (to 16 \u03bcM), indicating that latrunculin analogues target parasite actin during invasion and that activity against apicomplexan parasites is likely to be conserved (Johnson et al. 2016). But the high IC50s of these compounds against both parasites highlights that further development is needed.",

A pyrazole-urea based compound (C416) demonstrated the best growth inhibitory activity (IC50 of 0.145 \u03bcM) (Kortagere 2010) and further structure-based screening identified several analogues with improved activity over the original peptide (C2\u20131 IC50 0.047 \u03bcM; C3\u201321 IC50 0.385 \u03bcM). C3\u201321 was investigated further and was found to inhibit gliding motility of mosquito stage sporozoites, a marker assay for actin-myosin based motor function that is shared between sporozoites and RBC invading merozoites (Kortagere 2010). Comparative analysis identified that some compounds inhibited growth of both P. falciparum and T. gondii, thus suggesting a conserved target between the two divergent parasites. However, many analogues also showed variation in efficacy between P. falciparum and T. gondii, suggesting structural differences between the MyoA/MTIP interaction can be sufficient to reduce efficacy against different apicomplexan parasites (Kortagere 2010; Kortagere et al. 2011).",

            "text": "Invasion requires a co-ordinated series of proteolytic cleavage events to enable the correct function of essential proteins. The essential role of serine proteases in schizont rupture and RBC invasion have seen them become a significant target of invasion inhibitor drug development (reviewed in O'Donnell and Blackman 2005). The P. falciparum subtilisin proteases PfSUB1 (Blackman et al. 1998; Yeoh et al. 2007) and PfSUB2 are bacterial-like enzymes that have received significant interest because of the key role they play in the essential processing of proteins required for RBC invasion (Figs. 1 and 2) (Supplementary Table S1). PfSUB1 has been shown to cleave MSPs (MSP1, MSP6 and MSP7), invasion ligands released from the micronemes (AMA1) and rhoptry (RAP1) (Yeoh et al. 2007; Koussis et al. 2009; Silmon de Monerri et al. 2011) and is involved in priming the proteolytic cascade that leads to schizont rupture and merozoite egress (Fig. 1c)(Yeoh et al. 2007). Comparison of the stage-specific efficacy of the PfSUB1 inhibitor MRT12113 indicates that the IC50 against P. falciparum in vitro invasion inhibition (\u223c25 \u03bcM) was lower than that for schizont rupture inhibition (\u223c180 \u03bcM) (Yeoh et al. 2007), highlighting the potential sensitivity of the invasion process to chemical inhibition compared to other stages of blood stage development. Interestingly, a follow-up study identified that even partial inhibition of MSP1 processing at invasion inhibitory concentrations of MRT12113 was associated with invasion inhibition, indicating the sensitivity of the invasion process to chemical inhibition (Koussis et al. 2009). More recent studies have begun to optimise inhibitors of PfSUB1 from a range of chemical scaffolds (Gemma et al. 2012; Bouillon et al. 2013; Giovani et al. 2014; Kher et al. 2014). Plasmodium spp. SUB1 are highly conserved and trials using recombinant proteins suggest that \u2018pan-species\u2019 inhibitors can be developed that target the SUB1 of multiple species (Withers-Martinez et al. 2012). Indeed, an in silico screen using a 3D homology model of PvSUB1 led to the discovery of Cpd2, a compound that inhibits the activity of both recombinant PvSUB1 and PfSUB1 (Bouillon et al. 2013). Furthermore, Cpd2 had an in vitro IC50 of 0.37 \u03bcM against P. falciparum parasites and inhibited growth of P. berghei rodent malaria parasites in a dose-dependent manner, highlighting the pan-species potential of SUB1 inhibitors (Bouillon et al. 2013).",

            "text": "Recently its been demonstrated that the aspartic proteases Plasmepsin IX and X (Nasamu et al. 2017; Pino et al. 2017) have key roles in RBC invasion (Fig. 2d, f) and invasion/egress (Fig. 1b, c), respectively. Plasmepsin IX is located in the rhoptry organelle in merozoites and loss of this protease causes aberrant rhoptry formation and prevents cleavage of key invasion ligands (Nasamu et al. 2017; Pino et al. 2017). Plasmepsin X is located in merozoite exonemes (secreted from the merozoite prior to rupture) and is involved in activating SUB1 (essential for invasion and schizont rupture), as well as directly processing ligands excreted from the microneme (Nasamu et al. 2017; Pino et al. 2017). The activity of Plasmepsin IX and X was effectively inhibited by the hydroxylethylamine aspartic protease inhibitor 49c (Ciana et al. 2013) at low nanomolar concentrations, providing evidence that both essential proteases can be targeted by one drug (Pino et al. 2017). Furthermore, 49c was effective in a P. berghei rodent model of malaria against multiple lifecycle stages, including liver stage parasites and gametocytes (Pino et al. 2017). Recombinant Plasmepsin X was found to be inhibited by the orally bioavailable aminohydantoins (Meyers et al. 2014; Nasamu et al. 2017). Further investigation revealed the aminohydantoins inhibited P. falciparum growth in vitro at submicromolar concentrations and growth of P. chabaudi rodent malaria parasites in vivo, providing a second starting point for drug development against Plasmepsin X (Meyers et al. 2014; Nasamu et al. 2017). Since 49c is a potent inhibitor of Plasmepsin IX (rhoptry biogenesis and invasion ligand processing) and both 49c/aminohydantoins inhibit Plasmepsin X function (activation of the egress/invasion priming PfSUB1, invasion ligand processing), both chemical starting points offer activity against merozoite egress and invasion (Nasamu et al. 2017; Pino et al. 2017).",

One leading drug target involved in signalling during RBC invasion is calcium dependent protein kinase 1 (CDPK1), a parasite kinase not present in the human host (Harper and Harmon 2005) that has key roles in microneme secretion, activation of the actin-myosin motor and other processes required for RBC invasion (Fig. 2b-e) (Green et al. 2008; Bansal et al. 2013; Bansal et al. 2018). PfCDPK1 has been targeted in several high throughput screens (HTS) of compound libraries (Green et al. 2008; Kato et al. 2008; Lemercier et al. 2009; Chapman et al. 2013; Ansell et al. 2014; Chapman et al. 2014). 2,6,9 trisubstituted purines such as purfalcamine inhibited P. falciparum parasite growth (IC50 of 230 nM) as well as host cell invasion of related T. gondii tachyzoites, consistent with a CDPK in T. gondii having a key role in invasion (Kato et al. 2008; Lourido et al. 2010; Kumar et al. 2017). However, purfalcamine was unsuccessful in clearing P. yoelii rodent malaria parasites in vivo, possibly due to poor pharmacokinetics and reduced efficacy against PyCDPK1 (Kato et al. 2008). A second screen identified 3,6-disubstituted imidazopyridazines as compounds of interest, with modification of early leads reducing the growth inhibitory IC50 to < 100 nM and providing superior pharmacokinetics to the initial hit compounds (Chapman et al. 2013; Chapman et al. 2014). However, in vivo efficacy against P. berghei rodent malaria parasites was again limited (Chapman et al. 2013; Chapman et al. 2014). Further investigation revealed that a number of optimised imidazopyridazine PfCDPK1 inhibitors were more likely to be targeting P. falciparum cGMP dependent protein kinase G (PfPKG; Green et al. 2015). Based on conflicting evidence for whether PfCDPK1 is essential for blood stage parasite growth, the limited efficacy in vivo and variable specificity of inhibitors, it has been suggested that PfCDPK1 may not be suitable for blood stage drug development (Green et al. 2015; Bansal et al. 2018)(reviewed in Cabrera et al. 2018).",

Inhibitors of PfPKG are potent inhibitors of merozoite egress from the developed schizont and are being developed as antimalarials (Taylor et al. 2010). Studies have also identified that inhibition of PfPKG blocks invasion of mechanically released merozoites, with speculation that this invasion-inhibitory activity is due to preventing discharge of the invasion priming protease PfSUB1 (Fig. 1b, c) and interfering with phosphorylation of proteins thought to have a role in invasion including PfCDPK1 and invasion motor components (Fig. 2b-e) (Collins et al. 2013; Alam et al. 2015; Das et al. 2015). Recently, a highly potent series of compounds were developed based on an imidazopyridine inhibitor of PKG used for treatment of the apicomplexan parasite Eimeria tenalla in chickens. The most active of these, ML10, had an IC50 of 2 nM against P. falciparum parasite growth in vitro. ML10 was also highly efficacious in a P. chabaudi rodent model of malaria, with twice daily doses of 100 mg/kg for 4 days reducing parasitemia to undetectable levels in a P. falciparum humanized mouse model of malaria (a promising outcome for development of a PKG inhibitor for inclusion in combination therapies.",

            "text": "An alternative strategy to inhibit invasion is to target 3\u2019,5\u2019-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) which regulate degradation of cAMP and cGMP into AMP and GMP, respectively. Increased cAMP and cGMP leads to activation of PKA and PKG, respectively, making PDEs significant regulators of signalling during egress and invasion (Fig. 2c) (Collins et al. 2013; Baker et al. 2017). Screening of human PDE inhibitors identified zaprinast (growth inhibitory IC50 of 35 \u00b5M) (Yuasa et al. 2005) and a pyrazolopyrimidinone, termed BIPPO, (growth IC50 of 0.4 \u00b5M) (Howard et al. 2015) as having activity against PfPDE\u03b1, an isoform that specifically inhibits cGMP. Since PfPDE\u03b1 has been demonstrated to be dispensable to blood stage parasite growth (Wentzinger et al. 2008) and treatment with BIPPO causes activation of cAMP (PfPDE\u03b2) and cGMP (PfPDE\u03b1) dependent pathways, it has been suggested that BIPPO may inhibit multiple PfPDE isoforms due to conservation in active sites (Wentzinger et al. 2008; Howard et al. 2015). Modelling suggests that there are key similarities between human, Plasmodium and Toxoplasma PDE orthologues that would support this cross-reactivity (Howard et al. 2015). Indeed, BIPPO retains activity against isoforms of human PDEs, including PDE9 (IC50 = 30 nM), and selectivity for Plasmodium PDEs would need to be greatly improved before this PDE inhibitor could be developed as an antimalarial (Howard et al. 2015).",

However, relatively few screens have been directly designed to identify inhibitors of RBC invasion. Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) released a 400-compound library in 2011, termed the Malaria Box, which contains a diverse set of compounds that display antimalarial properties (Spangenberg et al. 2013). Subramanian et al. (2018) recently screened the Malaria Box for activity against P. falciparum blood stage egress and merozoite invasion inhibitors (Subramanian et al. 2018) and identified 11 out of 26 hits that inhibited the schizont to ring stage transition at an IC50 of <500 nM. Upon microscopic examination of blood smears, MMV665878 and MMV006429 treated schizonts ruptured normally, but free merozoites were found attached to RBCs and few successful invasion events were evident, a phenotype typical of invasion inhibitors (Weiss et al. 2015). Further testing revealed that MMV665878 and MMV006429 were potent invasion inhibitors with up to 50% of invasion events inhibited at concentrations down to 300 nM in assays using purified merozoites (Subramanian et al. 2018). Of the 26 compounds identified in this screen, 10 of them have been characterised as inhibitors of PfATP4, a sodium efflux pump on the parasite plasma membrane, indicating either PfATP4 is involved in egress and invasion, or that the compounds have targets additional to PfATP4 (Lehane et al. 2014; Subramanian et al. 2018).",

T. gondii in vitro motility and invasion assays were used as secondary screens against a library of 527 putative kinase inhibitors (Kamau et al. 2012). Of the 14 lead compounds with growth inhibitory or enhancing affects, compounds C5 (IC50 1.82 \u03bcM) and C1 (IC50 1.36 \u03bcM) were found to irreversibly inhibit motility or motility and invasion, respectively. A second study using a fluorescence microscopy based assay screened 1222 covalent inhibitors directly for inhibition of T. gondii tachyzoite attachment and invasion, identifying 5 invasion-inhibitory compounds. The leading compound, WRR-086, demonstrated low micromolar (IC50 of 5.7 \u03bcM) invasion-inhibitory activity. Biochemical and genetic analysis identified a homologue of human DJ-1 (TgDJ-1) as the target of WRR-086, with inhibition of TgDJ-1 linked to loss of microneme secretion and failure to invade (Hall et al. 2011). Screening compounds for their invasion-inhibitory activity is providing starting points for the development of drugs with novel mechanisms of action and uncovering new insights into invasion biology of apicomplexan parasites.",

Recent identification of the invasion-inhibitory activity of the antibiotic azithromycin (Wilson et al. 2015) marks one of the few clinically used compounds that have been shown to inhibit Plasmodium spp. invasion of RBCs. Macrolide antibiotics are known to target the malaria parasite's remnant plastid (the apicoplast) 70S bacteria-like ribosomal complex (Sidhu et al. 2007; Goodman et al. 2013). Inhibition of the apicoplast ribosome prevents replication of this essential organelle, resulting in the loss of isoprenoid pyrophosphate (IPP) precursor synthesis and parasite death a full two cycles of growth post treatment (termed delayed death) (Dahl and Rosenthal 2007; Goodman, Su and McFadden 2007). Despite the limitations of a slow killing antimalarial for treatment of disease, azithromycin's safe clinical profile and long half-life (>50 hours) has led to the antibiotic being trialled as a partner drug in artemisinin combination therapies (Cook et al. 2006; Sykes et al. 2009).",

Although the speed of azithromycin's invasion-inhibitory activity for an otherwise slow acting drug provides a new avenue to develop the drug as an antimalarial, the requirement for a 250-fold higher concentration of azithromycin needed to inhibit invasion currently prevents clinical use of this drug as an invasion inhibitor. However, of note is the identification of several analogues that show >5-fold improvement in invasion-inhibitory activity (Wilson et al. 2015, Burns et al. Unpublished Data), indicating that improved invasion-inhibitory potency is achievable. Importantly, the most invasion-inhibitory azithromycin analogues also exhibit improved activity against short-term blood stage parasite development and retain activity against the apicoplast, suggesting that azithromycin can be developed to have both fast acting (RBC invasion inhibition and short-term parasite growth inhibition) and apicoplast-targeting delayed death properties (Wilson et al. 2015, Burns et al. Unpublished Data). Given azithromycin's history of safety, proven activity, long half-life (>50 hours), availability of modified analogues and ease of modification, the identification of azithromycin's invasion-inhibitory activity opens up an attractive starting point to develop an invasion-inhibitory antimalarial with dual-mechanisms of action.",

As a standalone drug, it is unrealistic to expect an antimalarial which only targets invasion will eliminate all parasites within a matter of hours. However, such a drug could be of benefit in a combination therapy and, as demonstrated in this review, many invasion inhibitors have activity against other lifecycle stages. Combination therapies that have two (or more) safe and efficacious drugs with different mechanisms of action have significant potential advantages, including reducing the risk of developing drug resistance (Hastings 2011). Importantly, the reported mechanisms of action for invasion inhibitors developed to date are not involved in the mechanisms of action of existing antimalarials, limiting the likelihood of cross-resistance.",

Complicating the speed of parasite clearance, studies have highlighted that a number of clinically used antimalarials have reduced efficacy as malaria parasites transition from mature schizonts, through invasion and into newly established ring stage infections (Painter, Morrisey and Vaidya 2010; Wilson et al. 2013; Dogovski et al. 2015; Khoury et al. 2017).

In contrast, drugs with a short half-life, such as the artemisinins, have a much shorter selective window and are considered less likely to select for resistance due to minimal parasite exposure to sub-inhibitory concentrations (Stepniewska and White 2008); but more frequent dosing is required to maintain treatment efficacy. Therefore, there are several important considerations in selecting ideal drug combinations with the potential impacts on clinical efficacy, reducing the risk of drug resistance and reducing transmission all needing to be assessed for combination therapies that include an invasion inhibitor. Despite the potential benefits of having an invasion-inhibitory drug in antimalarial combination therapies, the therapeutic efficacy of a drug combination featuring both an invasion inhibitor and an intracellular blood stage growth inhibitor in vitro or in vivo has yet to be assessed directly. Thus, future studies will need to assess the potential synergies of using an invasion inhibitor in a combination therapy as well as model the therapeutic and resistance-proofing benefits of doing so.",

Inhibition of host cell entry is a validated strategy for HIV combination therapies (Kilby et al. 1998; Dorr et al. 2005) and the predicted viral generation time of HIV (\u226548 hours; Dixit et al. 2004; Murray, Kelleher and Cooper 2011; Puller, Neher and Albert 2017) is similar to the blood stage lifecycle of P. falciparum.

            "text": "The targets of invasion-inhibitory antimalarials under development are mostly essential, conserved and non-redundant (i.e. Yeoh et al. 2007; Boyle et al. 2010; Kortagere 2010; Wilson et al. 2015; Pino et al. 2017). The conservation evident in key, drug targetable, invasion machinery between malaria isolates, different Plasmodium spp. and different lifecycle stages (i.e. sporozoite invasion) is leading to the development of pan-invasion inhibitors. Therapeutic inhibition of invasion is likely to have profound effects on parasite viability since the merozoite has a short half-life and failure to invade immediately ends parasite growth and multiplication. This would mitigate the risk that parasites develop drug tolerance and persist as is the case for artemisinin resistance. Merozoite invasion may be more sensitive to treatment than other intracellular RBC stages, as demonstrated by a lower IC50 for invasion inhibition (\u223c25 \u03bcM) than achieved for rupture inhibition (\u223c180 \u03bcM) for the PfSUB1 inhibitor MRT121113 (Yeoh et al. 2007). Therefore, improving a drug's activity against the process of merozoite invasion could have a significant impact on parasite clearance and clinical effectiveness. To date, a number of diverse chemotypes with different targets have been identified to inhibit RBC invasion (Supplementary Table S1), but there is tremendous scope to develop new inhibitors of this essential step in parasite growth for use in combination therapies. The search for new invasion-inhibitory targets is helped by the availability of published mature schizont stage proteomic and phosphoproteomic resources (www.plasmodb.org) that highlight potential merozoite specific therapeutic targets for assessment (Solyakov et al. 2011; Lasonder et al. 2015). Encouragingly, the development of specific assays to quantify the invasion-inhibitory activity of compounds (Wilson et al. 2013; Wilson et al. 2015; Weiss, Crabb and Gilson 2016) has led to the identification of new chemical scaffolds that inhibit invasion.",

Another future research priority is the evaluation of invasion-inhibitory compounds in combination with currently used and new emerging therapeutics that target intraerythrocytic parasite development, including artemisinin. Such studies would better define the properties and timing of action of drugs to be used in optimal combinations. While proof-of-concept for invasion inhibitors has been demonstrated in animal models, further in vivo studies are needed to better define the therapeutic potential of the different inhibitor classes alone and in combination. Incorporation of mathematical modelling, as is increasingly being used in drug evaluation and clinical trials, to assess the ideal properties of invasion inhibitors in combination therapies in vivo would be particularly valuable for informing development priorities.",

(a) Late stage merozoite development showing partial formation of merozoite membranes and invasion organelles. (b) Merozoite formation is completed in mature schizonts. The PVM becomes permeable and PfPKG is activated, leading to activation and discharge of subtilisin-like protease 1 (PfSUB1) from the exonemes. The protease Plasmepsin X (PMX) also resides in the exonemes and is required to process PfSUB1 into an active form. (c) Cleavage of PfSUB1 by exoneme resident Plasmepsin X leads to activation of the egress regulating papain-like proteases SERA5 and SERA6, with loss of SERA 5/6 activity preventing merozoite egress from schizonts. Release and activation of PfSUB1 also leads to the cleavage of a number of merozoite invasion ligands including MSP1, MSP6, MSP7, AMA1, with the rhoptry antigen RAP1 processed by Plasmepsin IX (PMIX). Whilst these ligands are largely not required until merozoite contact with the RBC and invasion commences (see Fig. 2), inhibition of these cleavage events around schizont egress is associated with loss of invasion. Inhibitors have been labelled using a dual-colour system that allows their activity against merozoite development/egress (this figure) and their latter effects against invasion (Fig. 2) to be highlighted for inhibitors of: PMIX (purple/green), PMX (purple/blue), PfSUB1 (purple/orange).",

(a) Merozoites are released into the blood stream after rupture of schizonts (mature blood stage parasites), ready to invade new RBCs. (b) Initial attachment requires low-affinity interactions between the surface coat of MSPs, and host receptors on the surface of the RBC. (c) Merozoites reorientate such that the apical tip binds to the surface of the RBC and invasion ligands are secreted from the apical tip organelles; the rhoptries and micronemes. The rhoptry antigen PfRH5 binds to its RBC receptor basigin in a key early interaction required for merozoite invasion. (d) An irreversible tight-junction is formed when the microneme-secreted protein AMA1 binds to the rhoptry neck protein complex that is embedded on the RBC membrane. (e) Entry of the parasite is powered by an actin-myosin motor that pulls the RBC around the invading merozoite while (f) the surface coat of MSPs is simultaneously shed. Calcium signalling and phosphorylation by kinases are thought to play a key role in controlling the sequence of events required for invasion during this period. The vacuole membrane fuses behind the invading parasite forming a parasitophorous vacuole. (g) Shortly after internalization, a large proportion of RBCs temporarily distort in a process known as echinocytosis. It has been postulated that echinocytosis is caused by rhoptry secretion and rapid entry of Ca2+ discharged from the rhoptries into the RBC during invasion, but a more recent explanation suggests that it is incorporation of parasite rhoptry contents into the RBC membrane which leads to RBC membrane ruffling (Dvorak et al. 1975, Gilson and Crabb 2009). Examples of drug inhibitors which act at certain stages of the invasion process are labelled in purple. Labels with two colours indicate the inhibitor also has activity around merozoite egress (see Fig. 1).",
