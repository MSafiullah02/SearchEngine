At present, a great deal of attention has been directed toward patients with SARS. A novel coronavirus that has been identified in the majority of patients is the primary cause of SARS [10, 11, 18\u201320]. Genetic characterization of this novel coronavirus shows considerable differences between it and HCoVs 229E and OC43 [18]. The real-time RT-PCR described here can detect the novel SARS-associated coronavirus when used in a multiplex format. However, it has yet to be determined whether this is a favorable format, since the clinical presentation of SARS differs from the assumed clinical presentation of HCoV infection. However, for example, advanced age and underlying disease have also been associated with a more severe presentation of HCoV infection [8, 9]. Also, in case reports, HCoV has been associated with pneumonia after autologous bone marrow transplantation, and we recently identified HCoV by use of nested PCR in the BAL specimen of a severely immunocompromised patient with pneumonia [3, 5]. Interestingly, in the present study, we detected HCoV by realtime RT-PCR in the BAL specimens from 2 patients presenting with severe pneumonia and in the NTSs from patients admitted to the hospital with pneumonia, which again suggests that HCoV may be the cause of severe disease in some patients.",

[21] have already shown that 26% of upper RTI in elderly people living at home are due to HCoVs, and the identification of a recent community outbreak of HCoV OC43 in France was facilitated by the use of RT-PCR [7\u201311]. Although they are valuable in a research setting, these methods are less suitable for routine laboratory detection, because they still require timeconsuming sample handling and post-PCR analysis and are consequently prone to contamination. Besides being rapid, the real-time RT-PCR assay has the advantage of a standardized protocol that can easily be applied to the detection of other respiratory viruses: the RT-PCR can be performed under uniform amplification conditions, thereby using target-specific primerand probe sets.",

To gain insight into the relevance of a positive result by this assay, we followed 5 symptomatic patients during the course of coronavirus infection and also obtained specimens from asymptomatic individuals. The follow-up of the 5 symptomatic patients showed that HCoV RNA could be detected by real-time RT-PCR up to 14 days after infection. Moreover, we tested specimens obtained from patients without obvious signs or symptoms of RTI. None of the specimens obtained from healthy individuals contained HCoV RNA. At 1 time point, just after the bone marrow transplantation, we detected HCoV in an NTS from a bone marrow-transplant recipient without obvious upper and/ or lower RTI. It might be that the patient was suffering from a minor cold and that these symptoms remained unnoticed. From these results we have concluded that an HCoV-positive finding by real-time RT-PCR in a specimen obtained from a symptomatic patient has diagnostic significance.",

Serologic testing methods do not allow rapid identification of virus, and, although both HCoV 229E and OC43 can be propagated on specialized cells, the approach lacks sensitivity, is time-consuming, and often requires the expertise of a specialist. In addition, virus isolation is often considered to be redundant and without clinical consequence, since HCoVs are thought to be mainly associated with the common cold syndrome. It is likely that, as a result, the precise role that coronaviruses play in RTIs is greatly underestimated because of the lack of practical diagnostic tools.",
