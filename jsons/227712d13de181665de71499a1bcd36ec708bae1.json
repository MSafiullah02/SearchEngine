This pandemic extremely challenged the existing health care systems and caused severe mental distress to frontline healthcare workers. The authors describe the infrastructure of the team and a novel model of peer support and crisis intervention that utilized a popular social media application on smartphone. Such a model for intervention that can be used elsewhere in the face of current global pandemic, or future disaster response.",

Prior to that, many local physicians noticed a new kind of pneumonia caused by an unknown pathogen and Ai Fen, known as the \"whistle distributor\", initiated the reporting procedure to the local contagious disease control agents. Other physicians, including the soon to be wellknown whistle-blower, Dr. Li Wenliang, posted their concerns about SARS-like cases on WeChat, a Chinese social media and messaging application, but received administrative warnings and were summoned by local police. On Feb 7, 2020, Dr. Li WenLiang died from COVID-19 pneumonia. It has been reported that more than 3300 healthcare professionals contracted the Coronavirus while on duty, including at least 13 of them who lost their lives (https ://www. busin essin sider .com/healt hcare -worke rs-getti ng-coron aviru s-500-infec ted-2020-2).

We utilized an existing social media platform. We found that it was, despite many challenges, an effective way to implement mental health support. This form of disaster outreach via social media requires further study for development and improvement in different settings. Nevertheless, in the time of COVID-19 pandemic, psychological support to the frontline responders and community is of paramount importance.
