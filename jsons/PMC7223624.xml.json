Between 30 and 90 s, if the infant required PPV, those assigned to the iNO group received 30% oxygen and the study gas. A dose of 20 ppm iNO is the standard approved dose for neonates with persistent pulmonary hypertension of newborn (PPHN) and has been shown to be safe in preterm infants during early postnatal periods.28 Those in the placebo group received 30% oxygen and nitrogen added to the oxygen source via a delivery port built into the circuit. At 10 min of respiratory support, the study gas (iNO or placebo) was down-titrated by 5 ppm per minute until the concentration reached 5 ppm, then reduced every minute by 1 ppm until study gas was terminated (a total of 17 min).

Asphyxiated lambs resuscitated with 100% oxygen showed increased superoxide anions in pulmonary arteries compared to 21% oxygen resuscitation.26,35 These observations suggest that resuscitation with high oxygen concentrations should be avoided in premature infants as it may produce morbidities, such as ROP and BPD.1\u20133 This has been shown in premature infants where resuscitation with 30% compared to 90% oxygen causes less oxidative stress and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.10 Therefore, less oxygen exposure in premature infants during resuscitation is preferable, and iNO during resuscitation may produce these desired benefits. As observed in this study, iNO group required less supplemental oxygen over the entire study period. In addition, there was less exposure to hyperoxia (FiO2 > 0.60). This is probably due to the vasodilator properties of iNO, improving ventilation\u2013perfusion mismatch, and reducing the need for supplemental oxygen to maintain saturation targets. It is interesting to note that the iNO group maintained a lower oxygen requirement starting at 5\u20136 min of resuscitation, even as the iNO was slowly down-titrated, at 10 min of resuscitation. This finding indirectly indicates that the immediate vasodilator effect of iNO appears to be sustained, despite having a very short half-life (3\u20135 s). In contrast, the placebo group, after an initial positive response to ventilation, began requiring greater supplemental oxygen after 10 min.",

Cardiac output is dependent on the HR, contractility, preload, and afterload.36 We speculate that the observed differences may be due to improved lung perfusion associated with improved oxygenation and better venous return to the left side of the heart and increased left ventricular output. Therefore, improved pulmonary blood flow (i.e., enhanced preload) may be responsible for maintaining cardiac output and keeping pre-ductal saturation within the targeted range in the iNO group despite a lower HR.

In addition, several consented mothers were not enrolled due to precipitous delivery of extremely premature babies, unavailability of the team, or the baby aged out for enrollment.
