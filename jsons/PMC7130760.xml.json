            "text": "Biosensors offer the possibility of real-time monitoring, and the deployment of these devices in the field would provide a means for prompt etiologic diagnosis. All biosensors are essentially composed of a biologic recognition element or bioreceptor, which interacts with the analyte and responds in some manner that can be registered by a transducer. The bioreceptor is a crucial component, and its function is to impart selectivity so that the sensor responds only to a particular analyte or biomolecule of interest, hence avoiding interference from other substances. The transducer converts the microbial biorecognition event into an electrical signal detected using electrochemical, optical, or piezoelectric platforms.6, 7 A biosensor specifically targeting nucleic acids through hybridization is called a genosensor. Genosensors have been used to for direct, on-demand, and real-time detection and discrimination of microbial pathogens in clinical specimens. Malamud and colleagues8 developed a group of genosensor-based assays to detect microbial pathogens in oral specimens for use in the diagnosis of multiple infectious diseases. A piezoelectric DNA biosensor to directly detect hepatitis B virus was developed based on the mass-transducing function of a quartz crystal microbalance and nucleic acid hybridization9; another hybridization-based amperometric biosensor, using osmium as an electrochemical indicator, was used for the detection and confirmation of virus-specific PCR products.10 A generic semidisposable fluorescence biosensor was developed to directly detect dengue virus RNA.11 A hybridization-based genosensor on gold film coupled with enzymatic electrochemical detection was designed to detect SARS-CoV RNA.12\n",

Qdots also exhibit several unique features: high quantum yield, high resistance to photodegradation, and better near-infrared emission.13, 14 The new generation of Qdots has far-reaching potential for the study of intracellular processes in broad fields, including diagnostics.14 High-sensitivity bacterial detection using biotin-tagged phage and quantum-dot nanocomplexes has been described, which provides specific limits of detection at 10 bacterial cells/mL in 1 hour.15 A bead-based microfluidic device was developed to achieve an ELISA with Qdots as the labeling fluorophore for virus detection.16 Three groups have reported the use of Qdots conjugated to specific monoclonal antibodies to detect and identify the presence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in a real-time manner, implying that Qdots may provide a method for early, rapid detection of RSV infections.17, 18, 19 In addition to microbial pathogen antigen detection, positively charged compact Qdot-DNA complexes were described that can detect H5N1 Flu-A virus nucleic acids presented at concentrations as low as 200 nmol.20 Simultaneous excitation of several emission-tunable Qdot populations can be combined with a pool of differentially labeled probes for multiplex target analysis.21, 22 Qdot-based techniques are under development to detect a panel of respiratory viruses, producing more efficient assays that require smaller quantities of target nucleic acids.",

Amplification and detection of target genes can be completed in a single step, by incubating the mixture of samples, primers, DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity and substrates at a constant temperature. Because amplification is isothermal, LAMP does not require special reagents or sophisticated temperature control devices. Because the increase in turbidity of the reaction mixture according to the production of precipitate correlates with the amount of DNA synthesized, real-time monitoring of the LAMP reaction can be achieved by turbidity measurement.24 With a detection limit of about one to two copies, LAMP is capable of detecting the presence of pathogenic agents earlier than PCR if the gene copy number is low.25\n",

Each MLPA probe consists of a pair of oligonucleotides subject to ligation when hybridized to a target sequence, analogous to a padlock probe (see later discussion). One oligonucleotide consists of a 5\u2032 fluorescent label, a universal forward primer binding site, and a target-specific recognition sequence at the 3\u2032 end, whereas the other oligonucleotide consists of a target-specific recognition sequence at the 5\u2032 end, a nonspecific stretch of DNA of defined length (\u201cstuffer\u201d sequence), and a universal reverse primer binding site at the 3\u2032 end. Each MLPA assay is divided into three basic steps: (1) annealing of probes to their target sequences, (2) ligation of the probes, and (3) PCR amplification of ligated probes using universal primers. Multiplexing is achieved by varying the length of stuffer sequence for each unique set of probes used in the assay. Amplification products are detected using high-resolution electrophoretic techniques, such as capillary electrophoresis, and it is claimed that this approach allows relative quantification.42\n",

Recent studies have use of the MLPA assay for the detection and identification of several pathogenic microorganisms, including rapid characterization of Mycobacterium tuberculosis,45 and relative quantification of targeted bacterial species in oral microbiota.46 Reijans and colleagues47 described an MLPA technology\u2013based RespiFinder assay to detect 15 respiratory viruses simultaneously in one reaction. In this case, the MLPA reaction was preceded by a preamplification step that ensured detection of both RNA and DNA viruses with the same specificity and sensitivity as individual monoplex real-time RT-PCR assays. The RespiFinder assay showed satisfactory specificity and perfect sensitivity for adenovirus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), Flu-A, parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1 and 3, rhinovirus (RhV), and RSV. Use of the RespiFinder assay resulted in a 24.5% increase in the diagnostic yield compared with cell culture. This assay is being extended to cover four additional bacterial pathogens that cause respiratory tract infections: Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, and Bordetella pertussis.",

Multiple sets of high-concentration primers in the conventional multiplex reaction often favor primer-dimer formation, however, resulting in nonspecific amplification. To meet the challenges of conventional multiplex PCR, Han and colleagues76 developed target-enriched multiplexing (TEM)-PCR technology, which uses nested gene-specific primers at extremely low concentrations to enrich specific targets during early PCR cycles and relies on universal forward and reverse \u201csuperprimers\u201d at high, but unequal, concentrations to achieve exponential asymmetric target amplification.

The multiplex approach offered by the ResPlex II system enhances diagnosis through detection of respiratory viral etiologic agents in cases in which their presence was unsuspected and an appropriate test consequently was not ordered by the clinician.85 A recent study by Brunstein and colleagues84 revealed that, using the ResPlex II kit covering 12 viral pathogens, 2.5% of specimens were coinfected with two or three different viruses. (A low level of cross-reactivity between PIV-1 and PIV-3 was noticed using this assay.85) These coinfections are medically relevant, and effective treatment of severe respiratory tract infections will increasingly require diagnosis of all involved pathogens, as opposed to single-pathogen reporting.84 The original ResPlex II system detects only RNA viruses, but adenoviruses, bocavirus, and four coronaviruses have been added to a recently released new version of ResPlex II. Preliminary data indicate that the overall sensitivity and specificity of ResPlex II v2.0 is comparable to that of the ResPlex II panel. A notable number of previously negative samples were found to be positive for one of the newly added bocavirus or coronavirus targets (John Brunstein, 2009; personal communication). A factor that could diminish the analytical and clinical performance of ResPlex II and ResPlex II v2.0 is the potential for false-positive results caused by carryover of PCR products using the Luminex platform.",

The need for robust, high-throughput methods to replace the elegant Sanger method, which was described more than 30 years ago,86 has led to the development of several new principles. Ronaghi and colleagues87, 88 described in 1998 a pyrosequencing technique, a non\u2013gel-based real-time approach to sequencing DNA by monitoring DNA polymerase activity. Pyrosequencing is based on enzymatic inorganic pyrophosphate release by DNA polymerase. This reaction is stoichiometric; the amount of light produced is proportional to the number of pyrophosphate molecules generated and, hence, the number of incorporated nucleotides. Unincorporated nucleotides are degraded with apyrase before the next nucleotide is added. In this way, sequence information on an interrogated region is generated quantitatively in real time. Although basic approaches to performing pyrosequencing remain the same, numerous commercial systems have been used widely to rapidly identify infectious agents and screen for antimicrobial drug resistance.89, 90, 91 Multiplexed pyrosequencing involving the simultaneous extension of several primers hybridized to one or more target DNA templates92 has gained broad acceptance in the fields of cytogenetics, pharmacogenetics, and medical genetics.71, 93, 94\n",

Integration of high-throughput pyrosequencing with the Roche/454 instrument has become a powerful tool for whole genome sequencing without the need for additional equipment or molecular techniques other than standard PCR, Genome Sequencer FLX sample preparation, and the sequencing pipeline.113 Pyrosequencing generates sequence content quantitatively, which has made pyrosequencing a primary choice for quantifying specific mutations (eg, detection of drug resistance\u2013associated signatures) in mixed genomic populations. Because pyrosequencing byproducts inhibit the sequencing reaction, pyrosequencing read lengths are limited to less than 100 base pairs. Another drawback of pyrosequencing-based techniques includes secondary structure formation, which affects quality of the results, particularly with GC-rich targets. Additionally, it may be difficult to determine the precise number of nucleotides in a homopolymeric region based on peak heights.87 It is expected that pyrosequencing-based diagnostic devices will soon become available for rapid characterization and typing of viral pathogens.",

Reacted probes can be detected by way of reporter molecules attached to the linker.115 Alternatively, an amplified signal can be obtained from the circularized probes by rolling circle amplification. Padlock probes provide a means for detection and quantification of large numbers of DNA or RNA sequences and for highly multiplexed genetic studies.116 The application of padlock probes for the detection of microbial pathogens is a recent trend in molecular diagnoses.117\n",

Its rapidity and high resolution provide another powerful platform for the detection and characterization of nucleic acid amplification products. The technology is premised on the capacity of MALDI-TOF MS to discriminate individual PCR products contained in complex amplicon mixtures according to nucleotide base composition.142 The deconvolution algorithm allows base composition of PCR products to be deduced from mass spectrometrically measured molecular weights and the complementary nature of DNA, leading to organism identification. Early studies successfully used this technique to directly detect amplification products from PCR143 and ligase chain reaction (LCR).144 Soon after, the MALDI-TOF MS platform was linked to PCR amplification for genotypic analysis of hepatitis C virus145 and human papillomavirus.146, 147 Detection of human herpesviruses from clinical specimens was performed using MALDI-TOF MS following multiplex PCR amplification.148 A MALDI-TOF MS-based genotyping assay has been described that monitors development of hepatitis B virus polymerase YMDD mutant genotypes during lamivudine treatment.149, 150\n",

The system enables the identification and quantification of a broad set of pathogens, including all known bacteria, all major groups of pathogenic fungi, and the major families of viruses that cause disease in humans and animals, along with the detection of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance markers.151 The system has been used for rapid identification and strain typing of respiratory bacterial pathogens for epidemic surveillance,152 identification and genotyping of Acinetobacter baumannii strains in an outbreak associated with war trauma,153, 154 determination of quinolone resistance in Acinetobacter species,155, 156 genotyping of Campylobacter species,155, 156 and rapid genotyping and clonal complex assignment of Staphylococcus aureus isolates.157 We have used this system to detect Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, and Rickettsia pathogens directly from blood specimens for diagnosis of tick-borne sepsis (manuscript in preparation). In the field of diagnostic virology, this strategy successfully led to the inclusion of SARS-CoV in the coronavirus family.158 Furthermore, the Ibis T5000 Biosensor system has been used as a rapid and inexpensive tool for global surveillance of emerging Flu virus genotypes159 and rapid detection and molecular serotyping of adenoviruses.160 The system was able to detect and type all available Flu A genotypes, including recently emerged novel A/H1N1 (David Ecker, 2009; personal communication). The main advantages are high resolution, speed, and substantial degree of automation. The main disadvantages include the engineering difficulty of MS device miniaturization and need for continuous enrichment of databases with new genomic sequences.",

Relative simplicity, powerful multiplexing capabilities, and affordability for high-throughput detection make these platforms most attractive for screening and detection of a panel of respiratory viruses in clinical infectious disease diagnostics. Although not essential, the availability of Food and Drug Administration\u2013cleared products is a critical step in getting these systems into less-experienced diagnostic microbiology laboratories.4, 5 Opening of postamplification tubes and subsequent pipetting steps in the workflow of suspension arrays increases the risk for intra- and inter-run contamination for some assays. Careful attention should be paid to contamination control measures and the re-establishment of dedicated postamplification laboratory space in the real-time PCR era. Simultaneous testing for all possible pathogens is an efficient means to obtain a conclusive result and improves etiologic diagnosis.81, 137, 165 In addition, assaying for all potential pathogens may yield crucial information regarding coinfections or secondary infections.84, 166, 167 One study from the Netherlands indicated that implementation of multiple molecular assays for the etiologic diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections increased the diagnostic yield considerably, yet did not reduce antibiotic use or costs.168 Clinical relevance and cost effectiveness of simultaneous multipathogen detection and identification strategies merit further investigation.",
