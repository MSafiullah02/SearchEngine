Large solutes have low diffusion coefficients and therefore diffuse more slowly than small solutes. The diffusion rate for a particular solute under physiological conditions is a constant and cannot be increased. This defines the theoretical limit for an enzymatic reaction rate and also limits the size of a cell. If a solute starts at the center of a bacterial cell, it takes ~10\u22123 s to diffuse to the plasma membrane. For this reason, typical cells are microscopic (see Chapter 1). At about 3.3 pounds and the size of a cantaloupe, the largest cell on Earth today is the ostrich egg. However, a dinosaur egg in the American Museum of Natural History in New York is about the size of basketball. Since an egg\u2019s only function is to store nutrition for a developing embryo, its size is many orders of magnitude larger than a normal cell.",

Water readily crosses a membrane down its potential gradient from high to low potential (Figure 14.3\n) [4]. Osmotic pressure is the force required to prevent water movement across the semi-permeable membrane. Net water movement continues until its potential reaches zero. An early application of the basic principles of osmosis came from the pioneering work on hemolysis of red blood cells by William Hewson in the 1770s (see Chapter 2). It has also been discussed that MLVs (multilamellar vesicles, liposomes) behave as almost perfect osmometers, swelling in hypotonic solutions and shrinking in hypertonic solutions (see Chapter 3) [5], [6]. Liposome swelling and shrinking can be easily followed by changes in absorbance due to light scattering using a simple spectrophotometer. Therefore, osmosis has been investigated for many years using common and inexpensive methodologies and a lot is known about the process.",

Passive diffusion requires no additional energy source other than what is found in the solute\u2019s electrochemical (concentration) gradient and results in the solute reaching equilibrium across the membrane. Passive diffusion can be either simple passive diffusion, where the solute crosses the membrane anywhere by simply crossing the lipid bilayer, or facilitated passive diffusion, where the solute crosses the membrane at specific locations where diffusion is assisted by solute-specific facilitators or carriers. Active transport requires additional energy, often in the form of ATP, and results in a non-equilibrium, net accumulation (uptake) of the solute on one side of the membrane. The basic types of membrane transport, simple passive diffusion, facilitated diffusion (by channels and carriers) and active transport are summarized in Figure 14.4\n[8]. There are countless different examples of each type of membrane transport process [7]. Only a few representative examples will be discussed here.\n",

The limiting step involves the energy required to lose the waters of hydration. Table 14.2\nshows the relationship between the waters of hydration (proportional to the number of \u2013OH groups on a homologous series of solutes) and the activation energy for trans-membrane diffusion. As the number of waters of hydration increases from glycol < glycerol < erythritol, the activation energy for diffusion also increases.

Statistical pores result from the simultaneous lateral movement of adjacent membrane phospholipids in opposite directions. Statistical pores have only a fleeting existence and cannot be isolated or imaged.3.Passage down water chains.4.Water can be carried down kinks in acyl chains that result from acyl chain melting (see lipid melting in Chapter 9).5.Water may rapidly cross membranes through non-lamellar membrane patches (e.g. micelle, cubic or HII phase).6.High water permeability will occur at locations of packing defect (e.g. surface of integral proteins, boundary between membrane domains).7.Through pores or channels used to conduct ions.8.Through specific water channels known as aquaporins.\n",

From the activation energy for trans-membrane simple passive diffusion of glycol, glycerol and erythritol presented in Table 14.2, it can be estimated that the activation energy for glucose should be well over 100 KJ/mol, but instead it is only 16 KJ/mol. This large discrepancy is attributed to the presence of a glucose facilitated diffusion carrier. Figure 14.6\ndemonstrates the mode of action of one of these transporters, GLUT-1, from the erythrocyte [10]. GLUTs occur in nearly all cells and are particularly abundant in cells lining the small intestine. GLUTs are but one example in a superfamily of transport facilitators. GLUTs are integral membrane proteins whose membrane-spanning region is composed of 12 \u03b1-helices. GLUTs function through a typical membrane transport mechanism [10]. Glucose binds to the membrane outer surface site causing a conformational change associated with transport, releasing glucose to the inner side of the membrane where it enters into the internal aqueous solution (Figure 14.6).",

Although it had been predicted that water pores must exist in very leaky cells, it wasn\u2019t until 1992 that Peter Agre (Figure 14.11\n) at Johns Hopkins University identified a specific trans-membrane water pore that was later called aquaporin-1.

Aquaporins are specific for water permeability, excluding the passage of other solutes. A type of aquaporin known as aqua-glyceroporins can also conduct some very small uncharged solutes such as glycerol, CO2, ammonia, and urea across the membrane. However, all aquaporins are impermeable to charged solutes. Water molecules traverse the aquaporin channel in single file (Figure 14.12\n) [17].",

This gradient is coupled to the movement of a solute in either the same direction (Symport), or in the opposite direction (Antiport, see Figure 14.13\n[18]). Movement of the pumped ion down its electrochemical gradient is by facilitated diffusion. The purpose of both types of co-transport is to use the energy in an electrochemical gradient to drive the movement of another solute against its gradient. An example of Symport is the SGLT1 (sodium glucose transport protein-1) in the intestinal epithelium [20]. SGLT1 uses the energy in a downhill trans-membrane movement of Na+ to transport glucose across the apical membrane against an uphill glucose gradient so that the sugar can be transported into the bloodstream on the opposite side of the cell.",

When these enzymes convert substrate to product they do so in one direction. This enzymatic conversion is therefore \u2018vectorial\u2019 or unidirectional. Mitchell expanded this basic concept into his famous chemiosmotic mechanism for ATP synthesis in oxidative phosphorylation [25], [26]. For this idea Mitchell was awarded the 1997 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Vectorial metabolism has been used to describe several membrane transport systems. For example, it has been reported in some cases the uptake of glucose into a cell may be faster if the external source of glucose is sucrose rather than free glucose. Through a vectorial trans-membrane reaction, membrane-bound sucrase may convert external sucrose into internal glucose + fructose more rapidly than the direct transport of free glucose through its transport system.",

PTS is a multicomponent active transport system that uses the energy of intracellular phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) to take up extracellular sugars in bacteria. Transported sugars may include glucose, mannose, fructose, and cellobiose. Components of the system include both plasma membrane and cytosolic enzymes. Energy to drive the system comes from PEP (\u0394G of hydrolysis is \u221261.9 KJ/mol). The high energy phosphoryl group is transferred through an enzyme bucket brigade from PEP to glucose producing glucose-6-phosphate (PEP \u2192 EI \u2192 HPr \u2192 EIIA \u2192 EIIB \u2192 EIIC \u2192 glucose-6-phosphate). The sequence is depicted in more detail in Figure 14.17\n[27]. HPr stands for heat-stable protein that carries the high energy ~P from EI (enzyme-I) to EIIA. EIIA is specific for glucose and transfers ~P to EIIB that sits next to the membrane where it takes glucose from the trans-membrane EIIC and phosphorylates it producing glucose-6-phosphate. Although it is glucose that is being transported across the membrane, it never actually appears inside the cell as free glucose, but rather as glucose-6-phosphate. Free glucose could leak back out of the cell, but glucose-6-phosphate is trapped inside, where it can be rapidly metabolized through glycolysis. Group translocation is defined by a transported solute appearing in a different form immediately after crossing the membrane.\n",

However, upon closer examination the ionophore is actually a 12 unit (dodeca) depsipeptide where amino acid peptide bonds alternate with amino alcohol ester bonds. Therefore the linkages that hold the molecule together alternate between nitrogen esters (peptide bonds) and oxygen esters. The units that comprise valinomycin are D- and L-valine (hence the name \u2018valinomycin\u2019), hydroxyvaleric acid, and L-lactic acid. The circular structure is a macrocyclic molecule where 12 carbonyl oxygens face the inside of the structure where they chelate a single K+. The outside surface of valinomycin is coated with 9 hydrophobic side chains of D- and L-valine and L-hydroxyvaleric acid. The polar interior of valinomycin precisely fits one K+. The binding constant for K+-valinomycin is 106 while Na+-valinomycin is only 10. This emphasizes the high selectivity valinomycin has for K+ over Na+. Valinomycin, therefore, has an oily surface that readily dissolves in a membrane lipid bilayer, carrying K+ across the membrane down its electrochemical gradient.",

It is for this reason that valinomycin was recognized as an antibiotic long before it was identified as an ionophore. Currently several ionophores are added to animal feed as antibiotics and growth enhancing additives [33].

It is a synthetic lipid-soluble proton ionophore that dissipates proton gradients across bioenergetic membranes (mitochondrial inner, thylakoid, bacterial plasma). An uncoupler is therefore an H+ facilitated diffusion carrier. Elucidating the role of DNP in uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation was an essential component in support of Peter Mitchell\u2019s Chemiosmotic Hypothesis [25]. Electron movement from NADH or FARH2 to O2 via the mitochondrial electron transport system generates a considerable amount of electrical energy that is partially captured as a trans-membrane pH gradient. The movement of H+s back across the membrane, driven by the electrochemical gradient, is through a channel in the F1ATPase (an F-type primary active transport system, see above) that is coupled to ATP synthesis. DNP short-circuits the H+ gradient before it can pass through the F1ATPase, thus uncoupling electron transport, the energy source for generating the H+ gradient, from ATP synthesis. Therefore, in the presence of DNP, electron transport continues, even at an accelerated rate, but ATP production is diminished. The energy that should have been converted to chemical energy as ATP is then released as excess heat.",

The first crown ether was synthesized by Charles Pederson (Figure 14.20\n) while working at DuPont in 1967. For this work Pedersen was co-awarded the 1987 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Crown ethers are cyclic compounds composed of several ether groups. The most common crown ethers are oligomers of ethylene oxide with repeating units of (\u2013CH2CH2O-)n where n = 4 (tetramer), n = 5 (pentamer) or n = 6 (hexamer). Crown ethers are given names X-crown-Y, where X is the total number of atoms in the ring and Y is the number of these atoms that are oxygen. The term crown refers to the crown-like shape that the molecule takes. Crown ether oxygens form complexes with specific cations that depend on the number of atoms in the ring. For example, 18-crown-6 has high affinity for K+, 15-crown-5 for Na+, and 12-crown-4 for Li+. The crown ether depicted in Figure 14.19d is 18-crown-6. Like valinomycin, the exterior of the ring is hydrophobic, allowing crown ethers to dissolve in the membrane lipid bilayer while carrying the sequestered cation. It is now possible to tailor-make crown ethers of different sizes that can encase a variety of phase transfer catalysts. These crown ethers are used to catalyze reactions inside the membrane hydrophobic interior.",

Nystatin, like other channel-forming ionophores amphotericin B and natamycin, is a commonly used anti-fungal agent. Finding medications that can selectively attack fungi in the presence of normal animal cells presents a difficult challenge since both cell types are eukaryotes. Bacteria, being prokaryotes, are sufficiently different from eukaryotes to present a variety of anti-bacterial approaches not amenable to fungi. However, Fungi do have an Achilles Heel. Fungal plasma membranes have as their dominant sterol ergosterol, not the animal sterol cholesterol (see Chapter 5). Nystatin binds preferentially to ergosterol, thus targeting fungi in the presence of animal cells. When present in sufficient levels, nystatin complexes with ergosterol and forms trans-membrane channels that lead to K+ leakage and death of the fungus. Nystatin is a polyene anti-fungal ionophore that is effective against many molds and yeast including Candida. A major use of nystatin is as a prophylaxis for AIDS patients who are at risk for fungal infections.",

With time, however, the dye was observed to spread to adjacent cells through what appeared to be points on the plasma membrane. These points were later recognized as gap junctions. By varying the size of the fluorescent dye it was shown that there was an upper size limit for dye diffusion.

Examples of these ligands include hormones, growth factors, enzymes, serum proteins, LDL (with attached cholesterol), transferrin (with attached iron), antibodies, some viruses, and even bacterial toxins. After receptor binding, the complex diffuses laterally in the plasma membrane until it encounters a specialized patch of membrane called a coated pit. The receptor-ligand complexes accumulate in these patches as do other proteins including clathrin, adaptor protein, and dynamin. Since coated pits occupy ~20% of the plasma membrane surface area, they are not minor membrane features. The collection of these proteins starts to curve a section of the membrane that eventually pinches off to form an internalized coated vesicle. Clathrin and dynamin then recycle back to the plasma membrane leaving an uncoated vesicle that is free to fuse with an early endosome. After the early endosomes mature into late endosomes, they then go on to the lysosome for digestion. RME is a very fast process. Invagination and vesicle formation takes ~1 min. One single cultured fibloblast cell can produce 2,500 coated pits per minute.",

In endocytosis the cell plasma membrane extends and folds around desired extra-cellular material forming a pouch that pinches off creating an internalized vesicle (Figure 14.24\n, [52]). The invaginated pinocytosis vesicles are much smaller than those generated by phagocytosis. The vesicles eventually fuse with the lysosome whereupon the vesicle contents are digested. Pinocytosis involves a considerable investment of cellular energy in the form of ATP and so is many thousand times less efficient than receptor-mediated endocytosis. Also, in sharp contrast to RME, pinocytosis is non-specific for the substances it accumulates. Pinocytosis is not a recent discovery but was first observed decades before the other transport systems discussed above. Its discovery is attributed to Warren Lewis in 1929.\n",

In humans phagocytosis is restricted to specialized cells called phagocytes that include white blood cell neutrophils and macrophages. As with pinocytosis, phagocytosis generates intracellular vesicles called phagosomes that have sequestered solid particles they transport to the lysosome for digestion. Phagocytosis is a major mechanism used by the immune system to remove pathogens and cell debris. In fact very early studies of the immune system led Elie Metchnikoff to discover phagocytosis in 1882.

In exocytosis intracellular vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane and release their aqueous sequestered contents to the outside at the same time that the vesicular membrane hydrophobic components (mostly lipids and proteins) are added to the plasma membrane (Figure 14.26\n, [56]). Steady state composition of the plasma membrane results from a balance between endocytosis and exocytosis. The resultant process of plasma membrane recycling is amazingly fast.

Therefore by the process of exocytosis:\u2022The surface of the plasma membrane increases by the size of the fused vesicular membrane.
