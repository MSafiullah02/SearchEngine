The ripe fruit is eaten fresh out of hand or baked into pies, pastries, processed into preserves, jams, jellies, spreads or dried and used like raisins in cereals and snack food. The fruits are also made into cider, wine, beer, or tea. The Canadian indigenous people used the fruit in soups, stews, meat dishes, dried cakes and in a dried meat preparation called pemmican to which serviceberries are incorporated to impart fl avour and to act as preservative. Saskatoon berry juice was used to marinate other foods such as black tree lichen or roots to sweeten them ( Turner 1997 ) . The advent of new and innovative methods of processing, freezing and packaging have greatly increased fruit uses and growers in Canada are promoting it as a superfruit like the berry fruits.",

            "text": "Saskatoon berries appear to be an excellent source of manganese, magnesium and iron and a relatively good source of calcium, potassium, copper, and carotene (Mazza 1982 ) . Proximate nutrient value of raw Saskatoon berries per 100 g edible portion (dwb) was reported as: water 80 g, protein 9.7 g, fat 4.2 g, fi bre 19 g, total sugars 11.4 g, Ca 0.44 g, P 0.16 g, Mg 0.2 mg, S 0.06 g, Fe 67.5 pp, NA 31.8 ppm, Mn 67.5 ppm, Cu 7.23 ppm, Zn 16.5 ppm, Ba 34.8 mg, Mo 0.38 mg, Al 74.5 mg, carotene 29.7 ppm (Mazza 1982 ) . In a subsequent paper, Mazza ( 2005 ) reported the following nutrient composition in raw saskatoon berries per 100 g value, total dietary fi bre 5.9 g, total sugars 11.4 g, Ca 42 mg, Fe 1 mg, Mn 1.4 mg, K 162 mg, Na 0.5 mg, vitamin C 3.6 mg, vitamin A 11 IU, vitamin E 1.1 mg, folate 4.6 m g, ribo fl avin 3.5 mg, pantothenic acid 0.3 mg, pyridoxine 0.03 mg and biotin 20 m g. Total solids content in saskatoon berries ranged from 20% to 29.4% fresh weight with 15.9-23.4% sucrose and 8-12% reducing sugars (Mazza 1979 (Mazza , 1982 . Wolfe and Wood ( 1972 ) found that the sugar content increased slowly as the fruit matured and then accelerated considerably before ripening. They found that fructose content decreased greatly (25%) after the fruit ripened while the glucose content remained Plate 1 Leaves and young developing fruits unaltered. Anthocyanins, total phenolics, sugars, sugars-acids ratios and anthocyanins-phenolics ratios in Saskatoon berries ( Amelanchier alnifolia ) increased with fruit ripening (Green and Mazza 1986 ) . Titratable acidity and pH differed among cultivars but showed little change with fruit development. Anthocyanin contents ranged from 25.1 to 178.7 mg/100 g fruit, while total phenolics and soluble solids ranged from 0.17% to 0.52% and 9.6-18.7%, respectively. Signi fi cant correlation with anthocyanins was observed for total phenolics content, titratable acidity, pH and sugar-acid ratio. The results suggested that high contents of anthocyanins in Saskatoon berries were associated with high total phenolics and acids and low pH and sugar-acid ratios. The pH values of fruit ranged from 4.2 to 4.4 and titratable acidity values (% malic acid) from 0.36% to 0.49% (Mazza 1979 ; Green and Mazza 1986 ) . The major acid in saskatoon berries was malic acid (Wolfe and Wood 1972 ) and the predominant aroma component was found to be benzaldehyde (Mazza and Hodgins 1985 ) . The total anthocyanin content in fresh saskatoon berries was found to be 86-125 mg/100 g of fresh berries (Mazza 1982 ) . The main anthocyanins identi fi ed were cyanidin 3-galactoside, (61% of the total anthocyanins) and cyanidin 3-glucoside (21%). Also detected were cyanindin 3-xyloside, chlorogenic acid and rutin. Hellstr\u00f6m et al. ( 2007 ) found that saskatoon berries contained proanthocyanidins from dimers through heptamers and higher polymers. Saskatoon proanthocyanidins were generally of the procyanidin type, consisting mainly of epicatechin units linked by B-type bonds. Bakowska-Barczak et al. ( 2007 ) found saskatoon berries to have the following anthocyanidins: cyanidin, delphinidin, pelargonidin, petunidin, peonidin, and malvidin. Ozga et al. ( 2007 ) characterised the following phenolic compounds in Saskatoon berries: cyanidin 3-O-galactoside, cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, cyanidin 3-O-arabinoside, and cyanidin 3-O-xyloside identi fi ed as the four major anthocyanins in mature fruit. The quercetin-derived fl avonols, quercetin 3-O-glucoside, quercetin 3-O-galacto side, quercetin 3-O-arabinoside, quercetin 3-O-xyloside, quercetin 3-O-arabinoglucoside, quercetin 3-O-robinobioside, and quercetin 3-O-rutinoside were also identi fi ed in mature fruit extracts. In addition, two chlorogenic acid isomers (hydroxycinnamates), 3-O-caffeoylquinic acid and 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid were detected. The total content of the anthocyanin-, fl avonol-, and hydroxycinnamate-type phenolics detected in mature 'Smoky' saskatoon fruit was 140, 25, and 96 mg/100 g fresh weight, respectively.",

Of 17 Saskatoon berry cultivars, the Nelson cultivar was the richest in total polyphenol, anthocyanin, and procyanidin contents (801, 382, and 278 mg/100 g fresh weight, respectively) (Bakowska-Barczak and Kolodziejczyk 2008). This cultivar exhibited the highest antioxidant potential measured with DPPH and ABTS radicals (2.8 and 5.0 mM/100 g FW, respectively). Cultivardependent changes in polyphenol content were observed after freezer storage at \u221220\u00b0C for 9 months. In the Lee 2 cultivar, signi fi cant increases in anthocyanin and fl avonol contents occurred, while in the Lee 3 and Martin cultivars considerable decreases were observed. During the freezer storage, the antioxidant activity remained unchanged except for the Smokey which showed to be the most sensitive cultivar during storage. The Nelson and Lee 2 were the most stable cultivars during storage.",

Berry samples also exhibited the ability to regulate lipid metabolism and energy expenditure in a manner consistent with improving metabolic syndrome.
