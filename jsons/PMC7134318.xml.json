In a survey of over 2000 South Africans conducted by Pharma Dynamics in 2017 [2], more than 46% of respondents acknowledged that they indulge in activities that put their health at risk. Some important results of this study were that 21% of young adults do not take any interest in improving their health, whereas 88% of older adults have actively sought a change in lifestyle to improve their health. Of these older people, 69% make an effort to exercise regularly. This study also claims that 215 South Africans die every day from heart disease and even though genetic factors are at play, living a healthier lifestyle can avoid about 80% of these deaths.",

His Octalysis Framework (Fig. 1) represents eight core drivers that inspire, empower, manipulate or make us obsess, but ultimately drive us toward a particular action. The eight drivers are:\nEpic Meaning and Calling: People feel they have a purpose that is greater than themselves, or they feel unique and that they can achieve a certain task.Development and Accomplishment: A person feels challenged and is constantly developing. Points and badges validates that they have overcome the challenge, and feel rewarded for it.Empowerment of Creativity and Feedback: A person is able to try different things and given the opportunity to explore. They receive feedback and are able to use this feedback positively.Ownership and Possession: When people can own something, they will be keener to grow or improve it. This is often seen when people customise their personal space or their avatars.Social Influence and Relatedness: A person feels accepted, part of a group, or in esteemed company. Competitiveness is at play here. Relatedness applies to objects, places, activities, as well as people.Scarcity and Impatience: A person has a limited time period in which to achieve goals. When they cannot, they constantly yearn for it.Unpredictability and Curiosity: A person wants to find out what happens next, at the next level or what challenge they might face.Loss and Avoidance: A person feels like they will lose out or fail. The fact that something negative might happen keeps them going.\n",

Active days earn a discount on their medical aid premium and a cash back in medical savings (up to R1 000 a month) [19]. Since the launch of MAD in 2016, clients covered a distance of 98 million kilometres through their steps until October 2017 [19]. Seventy-four percent of clients have improved their cholesterol levels and 54% reported weight loss. Multiply also claims to have a lower claims rate for chronic illnesses as a result of Active Dayz\u2122 [20].

This finding is in line with the findings of a systematic review of gamification in e-Health [24] who found that the gamification elements that were most often used were \u201cfeedback, rewards, progression and social features\u201d. Another key outcome was that members and non-members need to be motivated differently. The members want to ensure they do not lose their points and statuses \u2013 an element of fear might drive them. The social aspect is also important to them, and it will be beneficial to add concepts that encourage competition or challenges between friends. This outcome supports the research of Roa and Pandas (cited in [24]) who reported that \u201cdeveloping positive social relationships and promoting a feeling of integration are the key social benefits noted for gamification\u201d. For the non-members, it is more important to receive feedback and be empowered. Another important factor for this group was \u201cEpic Meaning and Calling\u201d, which could be attributed to the fact that they want to know these goals are achievable.
