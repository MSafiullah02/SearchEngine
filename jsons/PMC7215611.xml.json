At times, this anticipated need is understood, such as flu vaccines prior to flu season. However, on occasion, there arises a new threat that is dynamic and less predictable based upon prior experience. The recent pandemic of SARS-CoV 2 is one such example. For the past 30 years, we have seen the introduction of viruses to the western hemisphere and the rest of the world where the population is naive to said viruses. These include Dengue, West Nile, SARS, Chikungunya, p (2009) H1N1, and now SARS-CoV2. Each virus arrived into non-immune populations and the successful or unsuccessful control of these viruses was dependent on the public health measures taken.",

However, the differences in public health actions across affected countries are evident, as are the subsequent increases, and in some cases, decreases, in new cases. For example, South Korea responded early with proactive and aggressive containment measures. This included the development of rapid testing capabilities within two weeks of the first reported case, and within a month, closure of public spaces and schools, the implementation of extensive drive-through testing, and universal airport screening. Importantly, South Korea also implemented robust case tracking and contact tracing, and a protocol to isolate infected individuals. This rapid response appears to have dramatically limited the spread and severity of COVID-19 in South Korea, where the current case fatality rate is <1% [5].",

The unexpected and sudden increase in cases led to delays in testing, case tracking, contact tracing, and isolation of infected individuals, ultimately allowing community spread to take hold and devastate the population in the affected area. The first quarantines were not established until three weeks after the first case was observed. Possibly, as a result of the dramatic community spread overwhelming the local healthcare infrastructure, the case fatality rate in Italy is over eight times higher than that observed in South Korea (7.9%) [5].",

The best mathematical models are not mere calculations done in the absence of present data, rather they are the result of well-reasoned experience based on past events that are expressed in a way that provides some measure of predictability of future events. As the United States appears to be 1\u20132 weeks behind Europe in the arrival of the pandemic, by applying the experiences, assumptions, and response types from both South Korea and Italy with what has been observed locally in the state of Utah, one can set boundaries and expectations and begin to understand the impact of preparations, and what responses are appropriate to mitigate the devastation caused by COVID-19. Below, we model the predicted progress of COVID-19 in Utah by applying observed patterns of the spread of COVID-19 in South Korea and Italy based on publicly available data, and use these, with the utility of statistical modeling, to provide a range of estimates of the timing and magnitude of the spread of COV-19 in this region.",

We assume that the number of new cases in both countries rises rapidly, peaks, and then declines according to the epidemic curve. However, the rates at which each country reaches the peak (determining the acceleration phase of the pandemic), and declines after its peak (determining the deceleration phase of the pandemic) characterizes the extent of control over the pandemic. From empirical data, there is strong indication that the spread of COVID-19 in South Korea and Italy should follow a hypothetical epidemic curve that demonstrates these two extremes (see Figure 1).",

            "text": "We followed five steps to build the forecast model: (1) determine how many days Utah is behind South Korea and Italy in reporting new cases. For example, many experts report that the U.S. is between one and two weeks behind Italy. In our approach, to align the start date of the pandemic in Utah relative to South Korea and Italy, we overlapped the first seven consecutive days with non-zero cases in Utah (starting on 11 March) with that in South Korea (16 February) and Italy (20 February) (see Table 1). Thus, Utah lags behind South Korea and Italy by 24 and 20 days, respectively. (2) The second step of the forecast is to predict the number of new cases in Utah, for a number of days into the future that is equal to the number of days representing the lag between Utah and South Korea or Italy based on each country\u2019s actual daily spread rates. Spread rates are calculated as the relative change in the number of new cases between two consecutive days. A list of the needed daily spread rates required for predicting new cases in Utah for the next 24 (South Korea) and 20 (Italy) days, is shown in Table 1. Since the actual daily spread rate is the relative change in new cases between two consecutive days by construction, it could be viewed in the sense of the Markovian property [8] as the number of cases tomorrow are assumed to depend only on today\u2019s number of cases (i.e., P(Xt|Xt\u22121,\u2026,X1)=P(Xt|Xt\u22121)). (3) The third step of the forecast is to calculate the cumulative number of cases for Utah, while allowing non-consecutive zero entries at the beginning of the spread. We first start with reported data (i.e., the cumulative daily sum of new cases from March 4th through April 4th in Utah, as reported by Utah Department of Health), and then end with the predicted data based on step-II (i.e., the continued cumulative daily sum of new cases from 5 April through 28 April based on the South Korea model and 24 April based on the Italy model. (4) The fourth step of the forecast is to fit a log-logistic model with four-parameters [9,10,11] for the cumulative number of cases, generated in step-3. This helps calculate the expected time for the peak of the pandemic (i.e., the incidence turning point) and expected time for the full carrying capacity of the outbreak (i.e., the total number of cumulative cases encountered throughout the pandemic). Log-logistic growth models are commonly used to model outbreaks, as they are able to capture the slow initial growth of the pandemic, followed by a period of rapid growth, and a period of slowing growth. These models have a characteristic sigmoidal (s-shaped) shape and mathematically have the functional form\n(1)f(t)=c+(d\u2212c)/(1+exp(b\u00d7(log(t)\u2212log(e)))\nwhere f(t) is the infected population size, t is time, c is the initial infected population size, and d is the carrying capacity, or final infected population size [12]. In the model, e indicates the inflection point of the logistic curve (i.e., the incidence turning point) and b is a slope parameter, which acts as a scaling factor [13]. (5) The fifth step of the forecast is to produce a smooth extrapolation of the growth curve model using time points beyond those in step-III. For example, the extrapolation to predict new cases in Utah will start on 25 April or 29 April, assuming the Italy or South Korea models, respectively. The drc library in the R statistical package [14] with drm() function was used to implement the four parameter log-logistic model (LL.4). For implementation purposes, one could use the R syntax:model = drm(y ~ x, fct = LL.4())(2)\nwhere x is time and y is cumulative cases.",

Prior to the expiration of that two-week order, on 23 March, the school closure was extended to 1 May. Over the course of several weeks following the first confirmed Coronavirus cases (associated with travel and community acquisition on 6 March and 14 March respectively) government leaders at both the state and municipal levels implemented a variety of patchwork policies including closure of restaurants and bars for dining in (take-out and delivery continue to be available) and restriction of public gatherings.

The novel aspect of this approach is the use of case studies of outbreaks of the same organism in the recent past to provide rapid estimates of the potential impact in areas lagging in the development of the pandemic. In this way, one can expand the training set used in the fit of the cumulative number of cases, plotted as a function of time, as the only input necessary for the forecast in the log-logistic growth model. While such an approach may provide fairly accurate estimates for the times nearer to the date of extrapolation, it is less robust for further extrapolations as seen in Figure 3b,c. The 95% confidence intervals of the forecasted number of new cases in these figures gives clear indication that one could rely on such methodology with a high level of certainty for at least the first 1\u20132 months of the extrapolation, a critical period for control of the outbreak. It is very possible to improve the performance of our forecast by using weights to account for the number of conducted daily tests. However, we intended to rely on a flexible mathematical modeling scheme with four parameters to give a simple approximation for two extremes while noting that better predictions are expected as the pandemic unfolds and more data become available.",

While a number of non-modifiable factors likely explain the success, or lack thereof, of jurisdictional mitigation and containment efforts, it is highly likely that differences in public health actions also play a significant role, allowing communities anticipating the virus to learn and adapt from action plans that have proven effective. In the current study, we identify a three-month variation in the likely length of the pandemic, a 1.5-fold difference in the number of daily infections, and a 3-fold difference in the expected cumulative cases when applying the experience of two developed countries in handling this virus to the Utah context. These variations, and the public health, morbidity, and mortality impacts they connote, both describe the possible distribution of outcomes for one U.S. state, as well as provide a cautionary warning about which public health actions must be urgently emulated and adapted to minimize the impact of the epidemic, and which are likely to result in local catastrophe.",
