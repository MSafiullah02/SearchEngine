Two weeks after the COVID-19 was first diagnosed in our country, there was a shelter in place order across the country as well as an order to cancel or limit all non-essential activities. Any gathering of more than five people was banned. As a result, all our educational activities were halted. At the same time, the hospitals across the country were hit by an unprecedented wave of COVID-19 patients that saturated the emergency rooms, ICUs and internal medicine wards. Meanwhile, our radiology department has been at the forefront of diagnosing COVID-19 due to the high sensitivity of CT scans (1), which are widely available across the country while there were insufficient COVID 19 laboratory test kits.",

They immediately developed a low dose screening chest CT technique (2) and a reporting template for rapid, consistent, and reliable interpretation and reporting of these chest CT scans. The CT technique and reporting template were readily adapted by the Iranian Society of Radiology and distributed across the country (3, 4) . This group also reported all related CT scans across our nine-hospital health system via a central enterprise wide PACS. As the volume of the CT scans increased, a second parallel group was created to address the surge in the volume. A few days later, in coordination with the Iranian Society of Radiology, a WhatsApp group was created and these two groups provided their services across the country, to ensure that every facility in the country, could receive the same high quality and fast interpretation of the screening CT scans for suspected COIVD 19 infection.",

These activities include daily lectures by the attending radiologists, group textbook reading and presentations by the residents, weekly journal clubs held in each hospital, monthly department-wide grand rounds, and monthly written examinations and OSCE exams for the residents. Additionally, the senior class who prepare for the national radiology board exam, have a series of lectures one morning a week presented by the attending radiologists. In response to halting the in-person teaching activities due to COVID 19, all the local lectures were moved online and presented live to all the residents across our department, regardless of their current hospital and rotation.",

Similarly, developing adequate skill to perform procedures need in person and hands on training. The changes we made to our routine workflow in response to COVID 19 are summarized in the flowchart below. These changes were necessary to provide adequate care to COVID 19 patients across our health system as well as across the country and to ensure uninterrupted training of our radiology residents.",
