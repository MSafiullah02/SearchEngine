The most tragic one, the Spanish flu, caused 50\u2013100 m deaths and considerable economic losses, according to the contemporary estimates. The WHO proposed a global program for the surveillance of influenza in 1947, based on the epidemiological and virological research (Bednarska et al. 2016a; Broberg et al. 2015). This program has currently assumed a form of the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, Poland has been participating in since 1957. The surveillance system has included the Sentinel program as of 2004. The surveillance is pursued in cooperation with general practitioners and laboratories of 16 Provincial Sanitary-Epidemiological Stations across the country. The epidemiological part of this surveillance is based on reports of cases and suspected cases of influenza and influenza-like illnesses. The virological monitoring is based on a laboratory confirmation of infection using molecular biology methods (Bednarska et al. 2016b). In addition, virological data recorded in the non-Sentinel program are collected from hospitals and private physicians.",

This goal has been reiterated in the 2019 publication of WHO entitled \u201cGlobal Influenza Strategy 2019\u20132030\u201d (WHO 2019). The surveillance is designed to monitor the spread of influenza virus from animals to humans. Molecular biology has been used to define the type of virus that circulates in a population in a given epidemic season as a candidate for the optimum seasonal composition of influenza vaccine. Further, influenza and influenza-like infection morbidity, comorbidity, and death have been recorded and expressed as the incidence of confirmed and suspected cases, the number of referrals to hospital, and variable activities of circulating influenza A and B type and influenza-like viruses. There are over 200 respiratory influenza-related viruses that circulate in the population. Therefore, virological surveillance is essential from both confirmatory and clinical standpoints. The latter has to do with advance preparation of proper vaccine composition for each upcoming season, taking into account the genetic and antigenic diversity of recently circulating influenza viruses as well as with the use of recently available novel antiviral medicines.",

On the basis of reports submitted by national influenza centers, virological situation can be traced in a given continent and also worldwide.

According to a WHO report, seasonal influenza viruses A/H1N1/, A/H3N2/, and type B continued to circulate, albeit at rather low levels. In Europe, the highest incidence and number of deaths due to infection with A/H1N1/pdm09 virus was recorded in the United Kingdom. In Poland, according to NIPH-NIH data, the number of reported cases of influenza infection was very low in the 2009/2010 season when compared with other seasons and also with data from other European countries. The peak incidence was exceptionally early in Poland as it took place in the last week of November 2010. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was the predominant type A virus (MRC 2009). The 2010/2011 influenza season appeared 8\u201310 weeks later than that of the previous pandemic season in Europe, but still rather early compared to historical trends. In Poland, the peak incidence was recorded in the first week of February 2011 (Wo\u017aniak-Kosek et al. 2012). Influenza A/H1N1/pdm09 remained the predominant circulating virus, but in contrast to the previous season, there were a greater co-circulation of influenza type B and an appreciable downtrend in the percentage of influenza A/H3N2/ virus (MRC 2010).",

The period of peak activity was somehow lengthened, comparably to the 2012/2013, 2014/2015, 2015/2016, and 2016/2017 seasons. The peak incidence of infections was reported in the 1st week of February 2018, amounting to 55%. In Poland, peak incidence was shifted forward to the 4th week of February 2018, but a significant rise in confirmations of influenza virus started already in the 2nd week of January 2018 and lasted till the 2nd week of March 2018. Influenza was confirmed in 96.7% of all infections, with type B/Yamagata lineage predominating in 65.5% of these infections. All European countries and regions with the ability to sub-classify influenza viral lines reported the predominance of Yamagata lineage in this season, whereas the frequency of type A subtypes varied (Francis Crick Institute 2018).",

In the epidemiological review above presented, the only exception from that pattern was the 2009/2010 season when the peak appeared in November of 2009. In nine out of the ten epidemic seasons, type A virus was the predominant source of influenza infection, whereas RSV predominated in influenza-like infections. There was an increase in confirmatory laboratory findings from season to season in relation to the number of biological samples examined, from 3.2 to 42.4% over the decade. Although the number of samples examined largely increased, it has remained just a fraction of a percentage point of the cases and suspected cases of infection, reported by health-care providers, which enormously increased from 568,958 in the 2008/2009 season to 5,337,997 in the 2017/2018 season. Influenza infection remains a health scourge and a major socioeconomic burden, with a dismally low yearly vaccination rate, which recently barely reaches about 3.5% of the general population in Poland.",
