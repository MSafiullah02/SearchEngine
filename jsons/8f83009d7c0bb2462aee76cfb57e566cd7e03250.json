During the past 60 years, individuals responsible for NHP importation programs have observed morbidity and mortality typically associated with infectious disease outbreaks. These outbreaks have included infectious agents such as tuberculosis, Herpesvirus sp., simian hemorrhagic fever, and filovirus infections such as the Ebola and Marburg viruses. Some outbreaks have affected both animal and human populations. These epizootics are attributable to a variety of factors, including increased population density, exposure of na\u00efve populations to new infectious agents, and stress. The practice of quarantining animals arriving in the United States was first applied by individual research programs to improve animal health and ensure the quality of animals entering research programs. The development of government regulations for nonhuman primate quarantine accompanied the recognition that imported NHPs could pose a risk to public health. This article briefly reviews the history of US NHP importation and the factors behind the development of NHP quarantine regulations. The focus is on regulations concerned with infectious disease, public health, and the health of domestic primate colonies. These regulations have had the dual benefit of protecting public health as well as reducing animal morbidity and mortality during importation and quarantine. We review current practices and facilities for nonhuman primate quarantine and identify challenges for the future.",

The word quarantine is derived from the French word quarantaine and is defined as \"1: a period of 40 days; 2a: a term during which a ship arriving in port and suspected of carrying contagious disease is held in isolation from the shore\" (Merriam Webster 2007) . In human medicine quarantine has long served to isolate patients with infectious diseases such as tuberculosis (TB 1 ), measles, or influenza from the general population in order to prevent the spread of infectious agents. The development of infectious agents that are resistant to currently available antibiotics has seen a return of mandatory-and controversial-quarantine for public health reasons, such as the recent incarcerations of individuals with drug-resistant TB (Moszynski 2007 ) and of individuals traveling in Asia during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (CDC 2003a) .",

Many of these imported NHPs were caught wild in their natural habitat (NAS 1970) , a practice that provided a ready source of research animals but that also, because of the methods used at the time, resulted in high levels of morbidity and mortality among these animals. The stress of capture, transport, and exposure to human pathogens resulted in epizootics of infectious disease in newly imported populations (NAS 1973) . Animals that were already immunocompromised from stress encountered novel viral, bacterial, and parasitic agents such as measles, Shigella, and tuberculosis (Kalter 1970) , and were therefore subject to disease outbreaks that caused the loss of animals, poor animal quality, and compromised research programs (DeValois 1960; Kalter 1970) . To address these problems, government programs and research facilities in the United States began developing conditioning programs in source countries as well as quarantine programs at facilities receiving animals to help detect the presence of infectious disease and prevent its spread in captive primate populations (NAS 1973; Whitney et al. 1967) .",

A basic premise of animal management is the philosophy of \"all in and all out\" in which populations of animals are not mixed or combined with each other due to the risk of disease spread. Karl Habel in 1947 stated (referring to rhesus macaque importation) that \"All large groups of fresh stock should be left as homogeneous as possible. All animals in a room should be used before more are moved in\" and further recommended that \"New monkeys should be isolated and released into the colony only if they have passed two tuberculin tests one month apart\" (Habel 1947) . Despite this advice, disease outbreaks occurred in domestic colonies as a result of the mixing of primate species in transit or inadequate biological separation of species at the receiving facility (DeValois 1960; Kalter 1970) . The mixing of individuals of the same species but different geographic origins always has the potential to cause a disease outbreak, as different infectious agents may have a different prevalence in different populations (Hunt 1970; Kalter 1970) . In addition, the exposure of na\u00efve young animals without maternal antibody protection resulted in rapid infection and spread in those populations.",

A variety of disease outbreaks occurred in the imported Asian macaques after exposure to African primates. This experience soon led to the recognition that many African primate species carry a specific arterivirus, simian hemorrhagic fever. This highly infectious positive-strand RNA virus agent is easily transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, or fomites (Renquist 1990) ; it has an incubation of 3 to 7 days in aberrant hosts; and it results in a severe hemorrhagic crisis, leading to organ failure and death (Mansfield and King 1998) .

The focus of the new regulations, enacted on October 10, 1975, was primarily on the provision of a health certificate for animals from countries where yellow fever is endemic and on the requirement that animals be shipped in mosquito-resistant enclosures in order to exclude yellow fever vectors. The regulations also established basic quarantine requirements and required that the CDC be notified of the occurrence of Marburg virus, yellow fever, or monkeypox in any group of imported nonhuman primates (42 CFR 71.53). The regulations prohibited the importation of nonhuman primates for use as pets and required facilities that import nonhuman primates to \u2022 register with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; \u2022 certify that imported nonhuman primates will be used only for bona fide scientific, educational, or exhibition purposes (as defined in the regulations); \u2022 isolate shipments of imported nonhuman primates upon arrival for 31 days (the time required for three tuberculin skin tests at 2-week intervals and the incubation period for known serious infectious zoonoses); \u2022 maintain records for each shipment of nonhuman primates; and \u2022 report suspected zoonotic illness in animals or workers.",

All staff in direct contact with animals should wear protective clothing (i.e., gloves and surgical masks and gowns) when opening crates, removing foreign materials from crates, feeding the animals, removing dead animals, or handling bedding materials. These persons should remove disposable protective clothing before leaving the animal holding facilities; this clothing should be autoclaved or incinerated. Nondisposable contaminated clothing should be disinfected on site before laundering. 5. Separate nonglass water bottles should be provided for each nonhuman primate during transit and quarantine. Reusable items should be adequately decontaminated between uses. 6. All animal waste, bedding, uneaten food, and other possibly contaminated items should be treated with appropriate disinfectant before removal from the animal holding facilities. All cages, feeding bottles, and other possibly contaminated items should be disinfected between each use or before disposal. Glass items should not be used. 7. A separate disposable needle and syringe (and, if required, infusion equipment) should be used for each animal, then autoclaved or incinerated. A clean needle should be used for any access to multidose vials (e.g., of ketamine) to avoid contamination. After each use on a group of quarantined animals, multidose vials must be autoclaved and discarded. Disposable supplies should be used whenever possible and must not be reused. Nondisposable equipment should be thoroughly disinfected. 8. Caution must be used to prevent infection from potentially contaminated needles, scalpels, or other sharp instruments, particularly during disposal of needles. Used needles should not be recapped by hand; removed from disposable syringes by hand; or bent, broken, or otherwise manipulated. Only one set of disposable syringes, needles, and scalpels should be used per animal. Used disposable syringes and needles, scalpel blades, and other sharp items should be placed in punc-ture-resistant containers kept as close to the work site as practical. 9. Nonquarantined animals should never be placed in, or permitted access to, areas with quarantined animals. This includes unrestrained pets, feral animals, and animals temporarily boarded for overseas travelers or destined for export. 10. Management should keep records of all serious febrile illnesses (fever >101.3 F [sic] (greater than 38.5 C\u00b0[sic]) for >2 days) in persons having direct contact with nonhuman primates in transit or in quarantine and should promptly notify CDC if such an illness occurs. Management should ensure that the physician providing care is informed that the patient works with and/or has been exposed to nonhuman primates. (4), for information on design and operation of animal holding facilities. Staff should use protective clothing, gloves, and masks at all times when in the animal holding facilities; these items should be disinfected or disposed of properly. 3. Staff should use fresh clothing when going from room to room. 4. Adequate equipment and space should be available for discarding and disinfecting all equipment, clothing, and caging. 5. Care should be taken to avoid scratches and bites of animals.",

Workers with a reactive skin test should be referred for medical evaluation. 6. All persons directly involved in the transportation and quarantine of imported NHPs should adhere to the importer's standard operating procedures approved by CDC under the special permit process. 7. In addition to the protective clothing requirements described in previously published guidelines (3), inspection personnel and other transit workers who handle crates or pallets containing imported NHPs should wear disposable dust/mist respirator masks and be trained in their proper use. Because of the potential for aerosol transmission of certain pathogenic bacteria (e.g., TB) and viruses, face shields or eye protection should be worn by workers whose faces may come within 5 feet of the NHPs. 8. All NHPs should be individually identified with a unique number or alphanumeric code permanently applied to the animal by tattoo.

In terms of NHP importation and quarantine, the impacts have also been beneficial. At the time of the agency's review in 1989 there were more than 140 CDC-registered importation facilities in the United States and the number of nonhuman primates imported annually approached 24,000 animals. The review process and the required changes caused many facilities to reevaluate the necessity of maintaining their CDC quarantine registration. As a result, by 1999 the number of such facilities had decreased to 27 and the number of animals imported annually had fallen to approximately 8,500, although the latter number subsequently rose again, to more than 27,000 in 2006 (Mullan 2006) . Similarly, before the implementation of the Special Permit process, nonhuman primate mortality rates during quarantine and shipment reportedly reached 20% (DeMarcus 2002), whereas by 1999 the rates had decreased to less than 1% . This trend has continued to 2006 (the latest year for which data are available) when, despite the large number of imported NHPs, mortality associated with transportation and quarantine remained below 1% (Mullan 2006) . The decrease in NHP mortality associated with transit and importation is due in part to improved procedures and in part to a change in the sources of imported animals.",

At the same time, the test has significant limitations as, for example, poor technique in its administration can lead to false positives and issues of sensitivity and specificity (Garcia 2004; Vervenne 2004) . Issues associated with TB diagnostics are addressed elsewhere in this issue (Lerche et al. 2008 ), but it is important to note here that although the perception of risk from clinically significant viral infections remains high, the most significant challenge to primate importation facilities is the screening process for tuberculosis. The development of rapid, cost-effective in vitro diagnostic assays of an infection with mycobacterial agents of significance is needed to improve the efficiency of nonhuman primate quarantine. The development of these assays could also benefit colony management by allowing differentiation of exposure to atypical mycobacterial agents rather than agents such as M. tuberculosis or M. bovis.",
