These could play a significant role in speeding patient diagnosis and, in some cases, reducing emergency room overcrowding. For biological and medical sensing applications, disease diagnosis by detecting specific biomarkers (functional or structural abnormal enzymes, low molecular weight proteins, or antigen) in blood, urine, saliva, or tissue samples has been established using a number of approaches, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), particle-based flow cytometric assays, electrochemical techniques based on impedance and capacitance, electrical measurement of micro-cantilever resonant frequency change, and conductance measurement of semiconductor nanostructures [1], [2], [3]. For some of these techniques, here are some drawbacks related to assay time and throughput. ELISA allows only one analyte measurement at a time. Particle-based assays allow for multiple detections by using multiple beads, but the whole detection process is generally longer than 2 hours, which is not practical for in-office or bedside detection. Electrochemical devices are low cost, but improvements in sensitivities are still needed for clinical samples. Microcantilevers are capable of detecting concentrations as low as 10 pg/mL but suffer from an undesirable resonant frequency change due to the viscosity of the medium and cantilever damping in the solution environment. Nanomaterial devices have provided an excellent option toward fast, label-free, sensitive, selective, and multiple detections for both preclinical and clinical applications.",

These HEMTs have been widely used as biosensors, as summarized in Table 24.1\n. By functionalizing the gate region with appropriate layers, highly specific sensing of antigens or other biomarkers can be achieved. In the case of SARS, the binding was detected through a change in current in the HEMT and allowed extraction of the dissociation constants of the nucleotide\u2013protein interaction. This is a good example of the use of HEMTs not only as sensors but also for determining the binding affinity of ligand\u2013receptor complexes [11]. Investigating the nucleotide\u2013SARS-N protein interaction can assist in constructing a genome packaging model. In the past, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and filter-binding assays have been used to study protein\u2013nucleic acid interactions [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. These methods require labeling of fluorescent probes or isotope elements on nucleic acids to provide detection. The assay cost is high and the labeling may alter the binding affinity of molecules. The number of binding sites and the dissociation constants of a receptor are related to the ratio of the number of ligand-bound receptors to the total number of receptors on the sensor and can be obtained in either one-binding or multiple-binding site models [15], [16]. The use of HEMTs allows rapid determination of these parameters. Similar studies have been performed for the binding affinity of nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) to the reverse transcriptase (RT) of HIV-1 for determining the efficiency of the drug performance. The HIV-1 RT immobilized HEMTs were used to find the dissociation constant of NNRTIs [16].",

ZIKV can be detected using RNA in human urine, serum, and saliva using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. However, the degradation of RNA in saliva may occur during the saliva collection, storage, and processing [13]. Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification was also used to detect ZIKV RNA in unprocessed biological samples, such as urine, plasma, and Zika-infected mosquito carcasses, with a detection limit of 0.71 pfu [14]. These methods are time consuming and require a well-trained technician to perform the tests. We have shown that functionalized HEMTs may be used for ZIKV detection.",

Pulsed biasing of the electrode fabricated on the cover glass and functionalized with Zika antibody was used for detection [20]. The target Zika antigen (recombinant ZIKV NS1) solutions were diluted with bovine serum albumin (BSA) in pF 7.4 PBS solution with 0.1, 1, 10, or 100 ng/mL concentration. The reversible antigen and antibody binding through active sites on these two protein molecules and the HEMT drain current changes could fit with the Langmuir extension model [20]. In addition, the Hookean spring model was employed to simulate the relaxation portion of the time-dependent drain current. Since the drain current is proportional to the gate voltage of the HEMT or the stretched distance of the antibody and antigen molecules, the solution for the stretched distance is directly proportional to the drain current (I\nD) as(24.1)ID(t)=(1\u2212c*)\u00d7A\u00d7exp(\u2212t[\u03bcs]\u03c41)+c*\u00d7B\u00d7exp(\u2212t[\u03bcs]\u03c42)+Ewhere c* is the ratio of antibody bound with antigen to the total available antibody on the functionalized contact window, \u03c4\n1 and \u03c4\n2 are the relaxation time constants of antibody and antigen molecules, respectively, A, B, and E are constants. Fig. 24.2\nshows the modeled drain current for PBS solution without antigen and PBS solutions with different antigen concentrations. The ratio of antibody bound with antigen to the total available antibody on the functionalized contact window increased from 0.013 at 0.1 ng/mL to 0.84 at 100 ng/mL, with the ratio scaling faster than concentration due to increased interaction probability. A wide range of Zika antigen 0.1\u2013100 ng/mL was detected.",

Conventional methods of detection involve the use of high-performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, and colorimetric ELISA assays; but these methods must be carried out at centralized locations and are too slow to be used in the field. Antibody-immobilized AlGaN/GaN HEMTs have been used to detect botulinum toxin type-A with a limit of detection (LOD) below 1 ng/mL [28], [29]. The antibody was anchored to the gate area through immobilized thioglycolic acid and the toxin detected through bonding to the botulinum antibody and the signal detected by changes in the HEMT drain current [28], [29]. The sensor saturated above 10 ng/mL of the toxin, with a LOD below 1 ng/mL in PBS buffer solution. The source\u2013drain current change was nonlinearly proportional to botulinum toxin concentration. The long-term stability was tested by storing the sensor stored in PBS at 4\u00b0C and periodically testing over 9 months at room temperature. The sensitivity losses were 2%, 12%, and 28% after 3, 6, and 9 months, respectively [29].",

If cheap technologies that can wirelessly detect breast cancer are developed, early diagnosis will significantly lower mortality. Antibody-functionalized, Au-gated AlGaN/GaN HEMTs were used to detect c-erbB-2, a breast cancer marker [47]. The antibody was anchored to the gate area through immobilized thioglycolic acid. The sensor showed a response of less than 5 seconds when target c-erbB-2 antigen in a buffer at clinically relevant concentrations from 16.7 to 0.25 \u00b5g/mL was added to the antibody-immobilized surface. This electronic detection of biomolecules is a significant step toward a compact sensor chip, which can be integrated with a commercially available hand-held wireless transmitter to realize a portable, fast response, and high sensitivity breast cancer detector.",

The most commonly used serum marker for diagnosis is prostate-specific antigen (PSA). One in six men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime [48], [49], [50]. The American Cancer Society recommends health-care professionals offer the PSA blood test and digital rectal exam yearly for men above the age of 50. PSA is made by cells in the prostate gland and is found in semen and in the blood. When prostate cancer develops, the PSA level usually goes up above 4 ng/mL. About 15% men with a PSA below 4 will have prostate cancer on biopsy. If the patient\u2019s PSA level is between 4 and 10, their chance of having prostate cancer is ~25%. If the patient\u2019s PSA level is above 10, there is more than 50% chance of prostate cancer. PSA testing approaches are costly, time consuming, and need sample transportation.",

Fig. 24.4\nshows the real-time PSA detection in PBS buffer solution using the source and drain current change with constant bias of 0.5 V. No current change can be seen with the addition of buffer solution or nonspecific BSA, but there was a rapid change when 10 ng/mL PSA was added to the surface.

CSF covers the brain and spinal cord, held in the central nervous system by the meninges. In addition to acting as a physiological buffer solution, providing nutritional and waste transport, it also helps to maintain intracranial pressure and acts as a physical shock absorber, cushioning the brain in the case of sudden movement or force. CSF is constantly replenished. In a normal human adult, there is 125\u2013150 mL of CSF at one time, which is replenished every 6 hours, so approximately 600\u2013700 mL of CSF is produced daily. Leakage of CSF leak is a serious complication that can result traumatically, iatrogenically, or spontaneously. While imaging studies can often elucidate the site of a leak, the standard for detection of CSF is an assay for beta 2 transferrin (B2) in nasal secretions or other drainage [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [67], [68], [69], [70], [71], [72], [73], [74].",

To achieve good sensitivity and handle the inherently low concentration of \u03b22 transferrin in CSF, laboratory procedures have required samples to be concentrated by as much as 10-fold or the sample to be run in duplicate to ensure accurate detection.

A disposable testing slide was externally integrated with a Si MOSFET to detect CSF from 0.1 ng/mL to 100 \u00b5g/mL. A Si MOSFET PCB was designed to simplify the testing setup. Human pooled CSF was diluted in pH 7.4 PBS and 1 wt% BSA with 0.1 ng/mL to 100 \u00b5g/mL. We recognize that the concentration of CSF is not the concentration of \u03b22T, it is actually much lower since it is only a minor constituent of CSF. To test the CSF sensor, diluted CSF solution was applied to the sensing electrode and allowed to bind for 5 minutes before measurement. Time-dependent detection of CSF dilutions from 0.1 to 100 ng/mL is shown in Fig. 24.5\n(left), while the response as a function of concentrations is shown in Fig. 24.5 (right).",

Elevated troponin concentrations can be detected in the blood within a few hours up to several days following the onset of angina (where myocardial cells suffer reversible damage) to AMI where myocardial cells die [75], [76]. The time dependence of concentration of these species is commonly detected by radioimmunoassay, ELISA fluorimetric, luminometric, colorimetric, and electrochemical methods, many of which are time consuming and require trained personnel to perform tests [75], [76], [77], [78], [79]. The measurement of blood troponin concentrations can decide whether AMI has occurred or that chest pain and other symptoms are due to other causes. Inexpensive techniques to provide rapid, accurate blood troponin concentrations would be welcome in managing treatment of emergency room patients.",

They were able to detect troponin I in blood samples in the range 0.006\u2013148 ng/mL, using antibody or aptamer functionalization [79], [80]. The cover glass approach leads to an increase in the pulsed current, as shown in Fig. 24.6\n[81]. In this configuration, the receptor immobilization produces a decrease in total capacitance of the solution plus dielectric capacitance and thus a decrease in effective gate voltage and an increase in current. The electronic double-layer HEMT designs enhance the current gain of the sensor in high ionic strength solutions, resulting in increased sensitivity and specificity in detection of troponin I. The ability to use a simple, functionalized glass slide as the active sensing area opens up the possibility of inexpensive cartridge sensors.",

A simple wireless sensor network is therefore needed to manage the collection and process of data from multiple sensors. The RF transceiver should be simple to reduce size and power consumption. Radio frequency identification (RFID) tags can be monolithically integrated on a chip. The device consumes little power and can operate with a small battery or without a battery. In the latter case, the tag device is powered by the external interrogation signal from the base station. Its low data bandwidth and low power operation make it suitable to integrate with sensors for wireless sensing, since the data bandwidth and operating power of sensor are also very low. Once the detected sensor data are digitized, it can be merged with the ID code and transmitted together. The RFID part of the integrated wireless sensor functions as a simple RF transceiver which receives base station signal to turn on the transmitter and sends back the sensor data. This type of wireless sensor is suitable for short-range operation similar to personal area network. The network consists of multiple sensors of the same function or different functions. Each sensor is connected to an RFID tag with a unique ID code that identifies its sensing function and location. In active operation mode, it sends out data to a central monitor station whenever the sensor detection is positive and triggers the RFID tag transmitter [83]. In passive operation mode, the sensor is activated by the central monitor interrogation signal and responds with the data.",

The current variation, embodied as a change in the output voltage of the detection circuit, will be fed into a microcontroller. The microcontroller will calculate the corresponding current change and control a ZigBee transceiver which will transmit data to a wireless network server. The block diagram of the sensor module and wireless network server is shown in Fig. 24.9\n. The transceiver module is completely turned off for most of the time and is turned on to transmit data in extremely short intervals. When the sensor module is turned on, it is programmed to power up for the first 30 seconds. Following the initialization process, the detection circuit is periodically powered down for 5 seconds and powered up again for another 1 second, achieving a 16.67% duty cycle. The ZigBee transceiver is enabled for 5.5 ms to transmit the data only at the end of every cycle. This gives an RF duty cycle of only 0.09%. Data acquisition and transmission, if continuous, consumes most of the power in a wireless sensing system. Since the sensor only needs to acquire and transmit data for a few seconds in every 10 minutes during normal operation, the average power consumption can be significantly reduced by using low duty cycle operation.",

There is also a need for small, hand-held sensors with wireless connectivity, which have fast response. For medical sensing applications, disease diagnosis by detecting specific biomarkers (functional or structural abnormal enzymes, low molecular weight proteins, or antigen) in blood, urine, saliva, or tissue samples has been established. Most of the techniques mentioned earlier, such as ELISA, possess a major limitation in that only one analyte is measured at a time. Particle-based assays allow for multiple detection by using multiple beads but the whole detection process is generally longer than 2 hours, which is not practical for in-office or bedside detection.",

Third, integrating multiple sensors on a single chip with automated fluid handling and algorithms to analyze multiple detection signals, and fourth, a package that will result in a cheap final product is needed. The stability of some surface functionalization layers is not conducive to long-term storage and this will limit the applicability of those sensors outside of clinics.
