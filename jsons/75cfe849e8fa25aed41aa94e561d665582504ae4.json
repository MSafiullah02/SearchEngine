A Adverse effects on the mental health of frontline healthcare workers (HCW) has been at the forefront of concerns, 1 with insomnia being one of the most commonly reported symptom. 2 Because of the fundamental role that sleep plays in emotion regulation and body homeostasis, sleep disturbance can have direct consequences on both emotional functioning and wellbeing. 3 As physician wellbeing and patient safety are inextricably linked, 4 it is imperative that we address sleep health for the sake of physicians and their patients. Over 1, 200 HCWs from 34 hospitals in China dealing with COVID-19 were surveyed for mental health and sleep problems in a recent cross sectional, survey-based, regionstratified study. 2 2 These self-reported symptoms were higher among nurses, women, and frontline HCWs, and in geographical areas with higher case infection rates.",

            "text": "During a pandemic, concerns about personal safety, transmitting disease to family members, stigmatization from being infected, shift work, and interpersonal isolation coalesce to disrupt sleep health. This can manifest by hyper-arousal states, as well as problems with anxiety and stimulus control (e.g., beginning to associate the bed with wakefulness, rather than restful sleep); all of these can have negative effects on physician wellbeing. 5 Moreover, specific lifestyle modifications such as home confinement and self-isolation can also negatively impact sleep health. Anesthesiologists may be particularly susceptible to all the aforementioned concerns given our direct involvement with high-risk aerosol-generating medical procedures, shift work, and redeployment to areas outside some practitioners' normal scope-ofpractice such as critical care units. Important biological factors also influence sleep pathophysiology including age (e.g., decreased amounts of slow wave and rapid eye movement sleep, increased incidence of sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), sex (e.g., women \u2022 Exposure to sunlight, and exercise during the daytime helps in attainment of sleep pressure accumulating by the end of the day \u2022 Caffeine persists in your system for a long time and may interfere with your sleep \u2022 Longer naps can lead you to get into slow wave or deep sleep, that is difficult to arouse from, and you may wake up with a headache and grogginess",

Physician burnout has been associated with an increased risk of patient safety incidents (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.59 to 2.40), poorer quality of care due to low professionalism (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.87 to 2.85), and reduced patient satisfaction (OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.42 to 3.68). 4 Given that sleep is even more disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic, we herein present some useful sleep habits partly adapted from cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia, relevant information and other resources for the frontline HCW (Table; and eFigure in the Electronic Supplementary Material). We are hopeful that optimal sleep habits, stress management, cognitive strategies for sleep, relaxation techniques, increasing awareness of common sleep disorders, and behavioural interventions may compliment institutional wellness programs and aid our colleagues during this stressful time.
