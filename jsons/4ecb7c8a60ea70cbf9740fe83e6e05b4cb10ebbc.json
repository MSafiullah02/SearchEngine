            "text": "Inexpensive pathogen genome sequencing has had a transformative effect on the field of phylodynamics, where ever increasing volumes of data have promised real-time insight into outbreaks of infectious disease. As well as the sheer volume of pathogen isolates being sequenced, the sequencing of whole pathogen genomes, rather than select loci, has allowed phylogenetic analyses to be carried out at finer time scales, often approaching serial intervals for infections caused by rapidly evolving RNA viruses. Despite its utility, whole genome sequencing of pathogens has not been adopted universally and targeted sequencing of loci is common in some pathogen-specific fields. In this study we aim to highlight the utility of sequencing whole genomes of pathogens by re-analysing a wellcharacterised collection of Ebola virus sequences in the form of complete viral genomes (\u223c19kb long) or the rapidly evolving glycoprotein (GP, \u223c2kb long) gene. We quantify changes in phylogenetic, temporal, and spatial inference resolution as a result of this reduction in data and compare these to theoretical expectations. We propose a simple intuitive metric for quantifying temporal resolution, i.e. the time scale over which sequence data might be informative of various processes as a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation of statistical power available to molecular clock analyses.",

            "text": "The combination of decreasing cost of sequencing and the unparalleled insight it offers have led to the adoption of pathogen genetic sequencing as one of the most effective tools in a modern epidemiologist's toolkit. When coupled with sophisticated models of evolution, pathogen sequences can be used to look into epidemiological features such as cryptic transmission (Faria et al., 2017) , migration (Lemey et al., 2009 (Lemey et al., , 2014 , and origins (Smith et al., 2009 ) of infectious diseases, amongst others. Pathogen sequences also contain information about past temporal dynamics before sequence data have been collected (Raghwani et al., 2012) due to the pattern of shared and unique mutations inherited from preceding generations. Molecular phylogenetic approaches rely on decoding these patterns of shared mutations into a nested graph known as the phylogenetic tree. Pathogens often have short generation times and some, like RNA viruses, also possess polymerases with low replication fidelity such that mutations are generated at a rapid pace (Drummond et al., 2003; Biek et al., 2015) leading to fast differentiation of pathogen lineages at the genetic level as they spread. With appropriate sampling and information (\"metadata\") about sequences, historic population dynamics can be inferred and quantified from pathogen phylogenies. Changes in pathogen population sizes over time (Pybus et al., 2000) , inference of unobserved ancestral states (Lemey et al., 2009; Dudas et al., 2018) , correlates of processes Lemey et al., 2014; Dudas et al., 2017) , and overall phylodynamic (Grenfell et al., 2004) patterns can be inferred from molecular phylogenies and used to understand patterns of pathogen transmission at a number of scales.",

Whilst subgenomic fragments of pathogens are very accurate and specific as diagnostic markers and informative about long-term evolution, their length (dictated by the compromise between information content and ease of sequencing) limits their utility in detailed molecular epidemiology investigations, for example during outbreaks (Wohl et al., 2018) , as only mutations occurring within the small region of the genome that is sequenced are available for phylogenetic inference.",

Generally, neutral pathogen variation at the nucleotide level ebbs and flows under the forces of population genetics, unlike beneficial or deleterious variation which tends to either fix or be purged rapidly, respectively. Due to their random and discrete nature, mutations are modelled as a Poisson process (Yang, 2006) where the waiting time t for observing a mutation at a single site is exponentially distributed with evolutionary rate parameter R. The probability of observing 0 mutations at a single site after time t is e \u2212Rt and the probability of at least one mutation is therefore 1 \u2212 e \u2212Rt . Higher evolutionary rates R or waiting times t result in higher probabilities of observing at least one mutation at the site in question.

By focusing our attention on a subset (600 sequences) of a well-characterised genomic sequence data (comprised of >1600 viral genomes) set derived from the West African Ebola virus epidemic of 2013-2015 (Dudas et al., 2017) we estimate loss in precision and accuracy of molecular clock models and phylogeographic inference methods when only the glycoprotein gene (GP), a region representing just 10% of the viral genome, is analysed despite GP evolving at rates faster than the genomic average. Our methods rely on masking tip dates and locations for 60 (10%) of the sequences in a classic training-testing split, where we re-infer these parameters as latent variables in MCMC. We show that this reduction in data not only leads to severe convergence issues in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analyses by removing the constraints additional data impose on plausible parameter space but can also result in unreliable tip date and location inference. Despite achieving much better temporal resolution when using complete viral genomes we still find residual error caused by inherent randomness of mutations which is close to theoretical expectations (Eq 2). We refer to this as the temporal horizon, i.e. a temporal resolution limit where population processes occurring at a rate faster than the rate at which mutations enter and are observed in a population will not be captured with high fidelity, even with genome sequences.",

This is likely to be caused by the combined effects of two sources of information. First, additional information is added by specifying the collection dates for sequences, which might exclude certain topologies from being considered during MCMC on account of the relatively small effective population size of Ebola virus in West Africa. Second, the generalised linear model approach to inferring migration is information-rich as it provides over 3000 possible parameter values (pairwise migration rates between locations) per predictor matrix, and thus if a few branches are strongly selecting for a \"correct\" predictor matrix to be included in the migration model that predictor matrix can then be used to determine the likely locations of branches for which less information is available. However, a simpler continuous time Markov chain model where each individual pairwise migration rate is inferred individually in a maximum likelihood framework exhibits broadly similar patterns too ( Figure S2 ).",

True collection dates for genomes are mostly (56 out of 60, corresponding to a coverage probability of 0.93) within the 95% highest posterior density of estimated dates, and the mean absolute error is \u224822 days across all masked tips. In contrast, the 95% HPDs for inferred dates in the GP dataset capture more of the true dates (58 out of 60, coverage probability \u22480.96) at the cost of markedly reduced precision, with mean absolute error going up to \u2248106 days or \u223c3.5 months. Despite having lower coverage probability, more precise date estimates are derived from complete genomes with an average 95% HPD width of \u2248102 days, compared to \u2248458 days for GP.

In contrast, migration processes are far more complicated and nuanced without a de facto standard for modelling, though continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) approaches are widely used (Lemey et al., 2009) with most advanced methods relying on generalised linear models without excessive overparameterisation Lemey et al., 2014; Dudas et al., 2017) .

Similar to other lineages, 'MK3462' was part of the sweep through Sierra Leone, though unlike others remained in-country, migrating to the environs of Freetown and then Bombali district where it was sequenced (Arias et al., 2016) . 'PL5294', unlike others, belonged to a lineage that was not part of the Sierra Leonean sweep and instead part of an unusual and under-sampled lineage endemic to western Guinea (\"lineage A\", (Carroll et al., 2015) ), from where it spilled into Sierra Leone's Kambia district late in the epidemic (Arias et al., 2016) .",

These are: population sizes at origin and destination locations, within country migration effect, and great circle distances, which are identified as strong predictors of migration with high (>50 Bayes factor, BF), albeit not categorical, support ( Figure 5 ). Four other migration predictors for the GP dataset have support >5 BF and <15 BF, which are international and national border sharing, Liberia-Guinea asymmetry, and index of temperature seasonality at origin. Of these Liberia-Guinea asymmetry and international border sharing are also found to be good predictors of migration in genomic data, though confusingly Liberia-Guinea asymmetry has the opposite correlation sign with GP sequence data. Apart from this deviation, predictors for both genome and GP gene datasets mostly have the same sign and very similar effect sizes. As mentioned previously (Figures 1 and  4) , this suggests substantial amounts of information being derived from collection dates and locations of tips rather than genetic information. The reduction in total numbers of sequences, as well as reduced phylogenetic information in the GP dataset appears to enable the migration model to explore combinations of predictors that would otherwise be confidently excluded with complete genomes and thus a larger number of predictor matrices is included in the migration model with low probabilities. The differences between genomic and GP data, though seemingly small (e.g. Figure 3 ) is more pronounced when looking at total entropy of inclusion probabilities: 1.285 nats for genome data, and 2.688 for GP sequences.",

Mean waiting times for a mutation as a function of alignment length and evolutionary rate. Contours correspond to mean waiting times under a given combination of alignment length and evolutionary rate. Genomes and barcode genes for a variety of viruses are shown with reported evolutionary rate confidence intervals (vertical lines), including analyses of Ebola virus genomes (red violin) and GP sequences (blue violin) reported here. Most genomes occupy parameter space implying temporal resolution of a mutation once every month or so, with mumps virus as an exception. Sub-genomic fragments on the other hand are expected to have mean mutation waiting times of more than a month. rate, R) and number of sites under observation (alignment length, L). Since 1/RL defines a linear relationship between rate R and length L mean waiting times for mutation can be reduced by an increase in either R or L. In order to double temporal resolution one can either double the evolutionary rate R or double the alignment length L. The former is generally outside the researchers' control, though genomic regions evolving at a faster rate exist in many pathogens. How much faster smaller regions evolve will depend on forces of population genetics, such as ability to recombine with respect to the rest of the genome (strength of Hill-Robertson effect (Hill and Robertson, 1966) ), as well as positive selection or functional constraints. It is thus unlikely that significantly higher rates will offset the reduction in resolution caused by focusing on a very small genomic region. Extending the region that is sequenced, on the other hand, is often trivial outside of resource-limited areas and can dramatically improve temporal resolution.",

In addition to theoretical expectations we also show where a variety of viral pathogens fall along the two axes -estimated evolutionary rates with uncertainty intervals on the y-axis and alignment length on the x-axis. Sub-genomic alignments shown in Figure 6 include the small hydrophobic (SH) gene of mumps virus (Cui et al., 2017) and glycoprotein (GP) sequences of Ebola virus analysed in this study, as well as sequences of two human influenza A viruses -genome of subtype H1N1/09 (Hedge et al., 2013) , and haemagglutinin sequences of subtypes H1N1/09 (Smith et al., 2009 ) and H3N2 (Rambaut et al., 2008) . With respect to temporal resolution influenza A virus HAs are expected to acquire a mutation every one to two months on average, compared to around three to six months for Ebola virus GP and over a year for mumps virus SH. Though all of these sequences are from (-)ssRNA viruses, SH and GP genes are part of a single non-recombining RNA genome (Chare et al., 2003) , whereas HA genes of influenza A viruses are encoded on their own segment which can be unlinked from their genomic background via reassortment. Because Ebola and mumps virus genomes do not recombine, their polymerases may have been selected for higher fidelity due to Hill-Robertson effect (Hill and Robertson, 1966) .",

This is achieved through having more sites rather than substantial differences in evolutionary rates, which differ only marginally with respect to subgenomic fragments. Despite this, no virus is expected to acquire mutations faster than about once per week on average, and the two genomes with highest predicted temporal resolution -MERS-CoV and H1N1/09 -are difficult to analyse due to recombination and reassortment, respectively, though advances are being made in modelling reticulate evolution (Vaughan et al., 2017) . The inverse relationship between observed evolutionary rate and sequence length is similar, but not the same as the relationship between virus genome sizes and mutation rates, where high mutation rates and large genome sizes lead to substantial deleterious mutation load (Pybus et al., 2007; Gago et al., 2009) . This upper limit on mutation waiting times set by optimal evolutionary rates is what we refer to as the temporal horizon -population processes with inverse of rate (i.e. waiting time) less than the rate at which a pathogen acquires mutations will not be captured with high fidelity by currently existing methods. The exact relationship between mutation waiting times and rates of processes will, of course, be complicated by the presence of co-circulating lineages, site-wise rate heterogeneity, and choice of model for population processes of interest.",

It is likely that this resolution limit will be improved greatly in the future by including additional information, either some aspects of a known transmission tree or, more likely, pathogen variation at the within-individual level, where variant sharing between two or more individuals is evidence of their linkage in a transmission cluster.

There have been previous incidents were a misunderstanding of the relationship between evolutionary rates and alignment length has been used to argue that low within-outbreak divergence in Ebola virus GP during the outbreak in Kikwit (Democratic Republic of Kongo) in 1995 was evidence of \"genetic stability\" (Rodriguez et al., 1999) . What is far more likely to have taken place, however, is the phenomenon we show with our GP data (Figures 1 and S1) , where even after more than two years of the West African epidemic the GP gene is too short to accumulate appreciable numbers of mutations. Higher reported evolutionary rates early in the West African epidemic (Gire et al., 2014) have also been misreported as having biological meaning, though not by the original study Rambaut et al., 2016) , and arose through intense sequencing of a single transmission chain where mildly deleterious viral variants might not have been purged by purifying selection. We hope that our study clarifies that evolutionary rates are primarily a parameter of statistical resolution, rather than of evolutionary forces, and on their own are not sufficient to correctly interpret molecular clock data. Ideally, in the future sequence length and elapsed time will be included next to evolutionary rate estimates in order to transparently communicate statistical power available for analysis.",

Sequences which fall into polytomies in substitution phylogenies (i.e. well-defined common ancestry, but no indication of exact branching order) are particularly problematic, since plausible temporal phylogenies can be reconstructed in the absence of mutations. The branching order of such clades in time trees will be determined via tree and molecular clock rate priors, since no information about branching order can be recovered from the sequences themselves. There are over 34 million possible rooted trees for a set of 10 sequences, but many of these might not be visited during MCMC if, for example, sequences are collected over time and effective population size (N e ) is low. Nonetheless, MCMC is particularly inefficient at sampling tree topologies for identical sequences (Whidden and Matsen, 2015) , since increasing the number of identical sequences leads to expansion of search space without adding additional information that could constrain the search. Until reliable methods are developed and standardised the current solution is to reduce the numbers of identical sequences going into temporal MCMC analyses.",

Sequencing complete pathogen genomes, in addition to providing the best possible resolution temporally in terms of mutation content (Figure 6 ), also ends up aiding in standardising data between studies, in the sense that a sequenced genome is a complete unit of data and there is nothing more to be done for sequence data except gathering better metadata.",

Sequence data, on the other hand, only become difficult to combine when sequences are too diverged to reliably align or are too numerous to infer phylogenies in reasonable time. Since divergence levels are generally low within outbreaks (with exceptions (Andersen et al., 2015) ), sequence data are often trivial to combine. More than that, including sequence data from previous studies can reciprocally contextualise both older and newer sequences (e.g. Mena et al. (2016) ). What remains problematic is determining and standardising additional data pertaining to the sequences themselves (\"metadata\") in a way that makes sequence data easy to use by other groups.

This is very likely to be caused by temporal and geographic, rather than genetic features of the sequence data (Boskova et al., 2018) . A clustering of sequences from a particular location collected over a short period of time is likely to be a genuine outbreak cluster within a wider epidemic and in the absence of genetic information phylogeographic models tend to group sequences by location. This might explain why in many cases when comparing analysis results between genome and GP datasets statistical power in migration model remains disproportionately high, despite retaining only 10% of available sites and mutations and results between the entire >1600 genome data set (Dudas et al., 2017) is very similar to the reduced data set analysed here. On a similar note, case numbers alone have been used to recover a gravity-like model for the spread of Ebola virus in West Africa (Kramer et al., 2016) previously, further arguing that the clustering of cases in time and space contains sufficient information about the movement of Ebola virus in West Africa. The overall conclusion from our study, as well as others (Wohl et al., 2018) , is that sequencing short genomic regions, instead of whole genomes is an ill-advised practice for investigating infectious disease outbreaks in any appreciable detail across relatively short timescales.",

A set of 600 viral genomes were randomly sampled from the filtered dataset of 943 high quality genomes. Of the 600 genomes that were chosen for analysis 10% (60 genomes) were chosen for masking, where for all subsequent analyses both the date and location were considered as unknown and inferred as latent variables. Date inference was constrained to the period 2013 December 01 to 2015 December 01, corresponding roughly to the presumed beginning of the epidemic in late 2013 and its end in autumn of 2015. Another dataset was generated by extracting the glycoprotein GP coding sequence (with padding inserted into the polymerase slippage site to bring it in-frame) from the complete genomes dataset, resulting in an alignment 2031 nucleotides long.",

Trees were rooted in TreeTime according to best r 2 value for root-to-tip against collection date regression with the 2 year constraint used for masked tips described earlier. A temporal phylogeny with marginal reconstruction of most likely dates for masked tips was carried out in TreeTime (Sagulenko et al., 2018) as well.

Ancestral location states were inferred in TreeTime using a continuous time Markov chain model identical to the one used by Lemey et al.

Whole genome maximum likelihood tree coloured by mutations occurring in GP. Colours indicate the cumulative number of mutations from the root occurring in the GP gene. Much of the clade resolution is lost when only considering mutations occurring in the GP gene, particularly in the already highly polytomic Sierra Leonean part of the phylogeny in red. Figure S2 . Maximum likelihood phylogenies of complete Ebola virus genomes (left) and GP sequences (right) with maximum likelihood ancestral location reconstruction. Trees were inferred in RAxML (Stamatakis, 2014) with ancestral state reconstruction performed in TreeTime (Sagulenko et al., 2018) . Inferred phylogeographic patterns are for the most part consistent with Bayesian results presented in Figure 1 with severe loss of statistical power when using GP instead of genome sequences. Figure S3 . Root to tip regression for maximum likelihood trees of genome (red) and GP (blue) sequences. Linear regression of sequence collection dates against distance from the root gives evolutionary rate estimates (slope of the regression) at 0.82\u00d710 \u22123 and 0.73\u00d710 \u22123 substitutions per site per year, respectively. Despite similar rates the correlation between collection dates and divergence from root is far better using genomes (r 2 = 0.76) than GP sequences (r 2 = 0.13). Figure S4 . Maximum likelihood inference of masked tip dates from genomes (red, left) and GP sequences (blue, right) using TreeTime. Vertical bars indicate the 95% confidence interval for marginal reconstruction of masked tip dates plotted against their true dates. Tip dates where the 95% confidence interval excludes the true value are shown in black. Figure S5 . Maximum likelihood inference of masked sequence location from genomes (left) and GP sequences (right) via a CTMC model implemented in TreeTime. Unlike the Bayesian GLM where probabilities are spread across different locations, the CTMC gives categorical support to one location. Genomes still perform better in terms of correct guess (0.432 probability that best guess location is true location for genomes versus 0.259 for GP), cross entropy (12012.800 nats for genome versus 24397.109 nats for GP) and mean probability-weighted great circle distance between true location population centroid and estimated location population centroid (87.568 km for genome versus 124.909 km for GP). Figure S6 . Calibration curve for phylogeographic model informed with genome (red) and GP (blue) sequences. Logistic regression of probability of the most likely location against whether it is correct or not for genome (red) and GP (blue) sequences with jitter introduced along the y axis to make points discernible. Overall performance of the phylogeographic model is comparable between genome and GP sequences, as indicated by sigmoid curves matching the 1-to-1 dotted line. Figure S7 . Entropies of posterior ancestral location reconstruction from genomes (red) and GP sequences (blue) for four tips. Ancestral state reconstructions from genomes typically have lower entropies relative to reconstructions derived from GP sequences, indicating better certainty in location assignment at any given time. Red and blue bars at the end of the plot indicate relative cumulative entropies of genome and GP sequence reconstructions, respectively.",
