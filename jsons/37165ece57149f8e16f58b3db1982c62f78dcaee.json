In order to understand their transmission dynamics, it is crucial, even from a 9 human health perspective, to investigate how host traits influence their prevalence. Bats are 10 important reservoirs for Adenoviruses, and here we use the results of recent screenings in 11 Western Europe to evaluate the association between characteristic traits of bat species and their 12 probability of hosting Adenoviruses, taking into account their phylogenetic relationships. Across 13 species, we found an important phylogenetic component in the presence of Adenoviruses and 14 mating strategy as the most determinant factor conditioning the prevalence of Adenoviruses 15 across bat species. Contrary to other more stable mating strategies (e.g. harems), swarming could 16 hinder transmission of Adenoviruses since this strategy implies that contacts between individuals 17 are too short. Alternatively, bat species with more promiscuous behavior may develop a stronger 18 immune system. Outstandingly high prevalence of Adenoviruses was reported for the Iberian 19 species Pipistrellus pygmaeus, P. kuhlii and Nyctalus lasiopterus and we found that in the latter, 20 males were more likely to be infected by Adenoviruses than females, due to the 21 immunosuppressing consequence of testosterone during the mating season. As a general trend 22 across species, we found that the number of Adenoviruses positive individuals was different 23 across localities and that the difference in prevalence between populations was correlated with 24 their geographic distances (P. pygmaeus). These results increase our knowledge about the 25 transmission mechanisms of Adenoviruses.",

Current 46 research on the dynamics behind host/virus interactions and inter-and intra-specific 47 transmissions is of scientific interest and important implications for emerging zoonoses and 48 consequently for public health. 49 The heterogeneity (understood as the inter-and intra-specific variation) in the ability of diseases that have received attention in the last years due to the potential risk they pose for 63 human pandemic events [8] [9] [10] or with important health and economic consequences world-64 wide, such as rabies outbreaks [11, 12] .

The potentiality of cross-species or cross-52 populations transmission depends on the characteristics of host and virus traits and is affected 5 53 directly or indirectly by a variety of ecological, social, or socioeconomic changes [3] that can 54 lead to new conditions boosting the expansion of the viruses to new host species or populations. 55 Recent studies have revealed that traits such as host phylogenetic relatedness, conservation 56 status, and geographical overlap are critical in the potential for cross-species transmission of 57 viruses [4,5]. 58 The highest proportion of zoonotic viruses in mammals is found in bats, primates and 59 rodents [6]. Specific bat characteristics like their ability to fly, unique among mammals, or their 60 migratory capacity [7], increase their potential role as vectors of diseases.

Among species, and according to the contact-rate hypothesis, 114 higher prevalence of AdVs is expected in species roosting in large groups, sharing refuge with 115 other species and/or mating in swarming aggregations. In addition, we hypothesize a strong 116 phylogenetic signal given the strong species-specificity found in the presence of AdVs. Within 117 species, we predict a higher prevalence in females because of their concentration in large 118 numbers in nursery colonies [34], with high contact rate and a high concomitant risk of infection. 119 In summary, our aims were to: 1) Test for significant phylogenetic component to the 120 presence of AdVs in European bats; 2) test the importance of ecological characteristics at a 121 species-level for the presence of AdVs taking into account phylogenetic relationships; 3) 122 investigate whether some individual characteristics are determinant to explain the differences in 123 the prevalence of AdVs within species.",

The 186 understanding of which and how host traits affect the presence of viruses in bats is a key step to 187 the understanding of the transmission mechanisms and evolutionary strategies of viruses. Such 188 mechanisms are key in the process of host switching that cause the appearance of emerging 189 diseases and therefore its understanding is important to improve disease managements [35]. Our 190 results show that Adenoviruses seem to be quite common in European bats since they were 191 found across all the studied tribes and in most genera (except for Barbastella and Miniopterus) 192 but their prevalence varied considerably among species [16]. The three most abundant species 193 showing the highest frequency of adenovirus infection (Nyctalus lasiopterus, Pipistrellus 194 pygmaeus and P. kuhlii) experienced an average of 9.97% prevalence. In contrast, other species 195 showed very low Adenovirus presence and was completely absent in others despite their large 196 sample sizes (e.g.: Miniopterus schreibersii) but in other species, the absence of positive results 197 could be due to the low number of sampled individuals (generally the rarest bats in Europe).198 Fritz's D, Pagel's \u03bb and Blomberg's K parameters all pointed to a strong phylogenetic 199 signal in the presence of AdVs across European bats and consequently, the need for accounting 200 for phylogenetic relationships in all subsequent models. This phylogenetic component of the 201 distribution pattern of AdVs in bats was also recently suggested by Iglesias-Caballero et al.

Bats were 271 mist-netted near roosts or over water and released in the same collecting point after sampling. 272 Each animal was identified, sexed, measured and weighed. Sampling consisted of obtaining a 273 membrane wing-punch, saliva with oropharyngeal swabs and stool samples (when this was 274 possible). Swabs were stored in 1.5 mL tubes filled with lysis buffer. All samples were aliquoted 275 and stored at -80 \u00b0C prior to analysis. Samples were screened for AdVs following published 276 protocols [16,47,48]. Our own database was completed with the published data of AdVs 277 presence in bats from Germany and Hungary [25,26]. The identification of bats belonging to 278 species complexes was confirmed through PCR amplification of a diagnostic mtDNA fragment 279 following Iba\u00f1ez et al., [49] and Ka\u0148uch et al. [50]. 280 Phylogeny and phylogenetic signal 15 281 A fully resolved phylogeny containing all the study species was not available from the 282 literature and is notoriously difficult to reconstruct for this group, [51] and so a hybrid approach 283 was taken whereby, published trees were grafted to obtain a full-solved topology whereas branch 284 lengths were estimated using molecular sequence data. The published phylogenetic studies for 285 the four families existing in Europe, used to manually construct a topology of all species in this 286 study were Guill\u00e9n-Servent et al., [52] for relationship in the family Rhinolophidae; Ruedi et al., 287 [53] and Stadelmann et al. [54] for the subfamily Myotinae within Vespertilionidae; and Hoofer 288 and Bussche [55] for the rest of this last family and for the family Miniopteridae. Complete 289 sequences of the mitochondrial genes cytochrome b (CYTB) and NADH dehydrogenase 1 (ND1) 290 were obtained from GenBank for all available European species and were used to estimate 291 branch length in the constructed topology. This dataset needed to generate sequences de novo for 292 the species Miniopterus schreibersii for which these markers were not available. The new 293 sequences are deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers MK737740 and MK737741. 294 For each locus sequences were aligned with the software 'ALTER' from 295 http://darwin.uvigo.es/software/ [56] and MEGA [57], and partitionfinder v2.1.1 [58] was run on 296 the concatenated alignment (1805 base pairs in length) to obtain the optimal partitioning scheme 297 and substitution models. Partitionfinder was set to use unlinked branch lengths, search only 298 BEAST models with the 'greedy' algorithm and AICc as the model selection criterion. A 299 maximum of six possible partitions were allowed; the three codon positions of the two loci.",

For all these reasons, bats provide a good model to inspect the correlation of hosttrait characteristics with the prevalence of viruses. Adenoviruses (AdVs) are non-enveloped dsDNA viruses with a broad range of vertebrate hosts, including humans. These viruses have been grouped into five genera [20]: Mastadenovirus Atadenovirus (mammals, birds and reptiles), Aviadenovirus (birds), Siadenovirus 79 (poultry and amphibians) and Ichtadenovirus (fish). Symptoms in humans include respiratory, eye infections and intestinal or digestive illness and seldom lead to mortality [21,22]. Since the first detection of an AdV in a fruit bat from Japan [23], a high diversity of AdVs has been isolated from bats from America, Africa and Asia, all grouped within the genus Mastadenovirus 83 [24]. The first AdV in a European bat was isolated from a common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) in Germany [25]. Later, Vidovszky et al. [26] obtained partial sequences from as many as 28 presumably new AdVs hosted by 12 different bat species in Germany and Hungary. Iglesias-Caballero et al. [16] conducted a country-wide survey in Spain constituting the largest screening for AdVs in bats to date, checking >1,000 individuals belonging to 28 species and focusing not only on the analysis of fecal samples and internal tissues -as in previous studiesbut also on the analysis of the oropharyngeal swabs. AdVs are detected in almost half of the Iberian bat species studied, in both feces and in the upper respiratory tract (for the first time in bats), establishing a possible fecal-oral transmission route in two Pipistrellus pygmaeus. Moreover, they found a surprisingly high prevalence in this species together with the co-generic P. kuhlii and the closely related giant noctule, Nyctalus lasiopterus, which accounted for the vast majority of viruses detected in the study. These results have presented us with the opportunity to analyze the abiotic factors or biotic traits determining prevalence of AdVs in European bats at two levels: across-species and among individuals within a species. The analysis of morphological and behavioral traits and presence of AdVs in bats is also useful for the understanding of viral transmission dynamics. In fact, little is known about the transmission mechanisms of AdVs and no study has focused on transmission in bats. A handful 100of studies in humans suggest that transmission may need direct contact or at least a droplet spraying (such as those produced by coughing or sneezing) or aerosol[27][28][29]. The strong host specificity and the parallelism between host and AdVs phylogenies found for bats[16,30]  and for primates [31] strongly suggest that cross-species switching of mastadenovirus are not frequent events although they have been detected in AdVs evolution[30].No study has focused so far on the analyses of the determinant factors influencing prevalence of viruses on bats at both species and individual levels.

The fully resolved phylogeny for all the studied species with proportional branch lengths 153 was used to estimate the different phylogenetic component in AdVs presence (S1 Fig).

Swarming related to mating is shown mainly by forest species and is described as the gathering of bats, commonly in caves and underground sites, during a few hours after dusk and for a few days[36]. Two hypotheses could explain this finding. Firstly, bat species engaging in swarming seem to be in contact for only a short time, which would imply a plausible hypothesis is based on the fact that mammals with high infection risk, especially those with promiscuous behavior, develop a stronger immune system compared to species with low When analyzing the effect on the AdVs presence of within-species variance in traits, we found that the site of capture explains an important part of the variance of all models suggesting an underlying general pattern across species and supporting the contact-rate hypothesis.

Subadult bats usually have slightly longer forearms [34] and the lower prevalence in bats with larger measures could be explained by the influence of the antibody loads transferred to them through their mother's milk in still developing bats, making them less suitable to Adenoviruses prevalence[45]. This is just a possibility and further studies should help understand the relationships between Adenoviruses presence and age.",

At the individual level, the analyses focused on the three species that showed the highest AdVs presence combined with a large enough sample size (> 200 individuals). The recorded variables were: (1) LOCALITY: site of capture; (2) SEX: male or female; (3) FOREARM: Measured in mm. For among-species comparisons, AdVs prevalence was analyzed as the arcsintransformed proportion of positive samples over the total number of samples for each species. Species with fewer than 10 samples were eliminated from the matrix and from the phylogeny. The analyses were also run considering presence/absence of AdVs as a dependent variable and including in this case all sampled species. The analyses were performed with R statistical computing packages [65] and scripts are available upon request.

Models of trait evolution were compared assuming correlation structures under either Brownian motion, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck or Pagel models [70] and the best model was selected based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) 349 [71]. As a threshold value for model selection, a model showing \u2206AIC > 3 was taken as having greater support [72]. Complementary, a binary phylogenetic generalized linear model was run for each species, with presence of AdVs as the dependent variable and using the 'Ape' package Within species, we used general linear mixed models implemented in the 'Lme4' package 354[74] to test for associations between traits and presence of AdVs, and considering AdVs presence as a binary dependent variable. In order to account for uncontrolled spatial variation, LOCALITY was included in the models as a random variable. The best linear mixed model was again selected based on AIC and same threshold criterion. As a confirmatory analysis for the models, the variance explained by only the fixed variables was compared to the variance obtained including the random variables using the package 'Mumin'[75]",
