To minimize these, set up and test technical platforms in advance, leaving enough time to obtain alternate equipment if necessary.\u2022Read instructions from interviewers and download the proper program to a reliable computer.

If the program includes specific contact information for the virtual interview platform, save it into the application.\u2022Fill out your profile within the application, including a professional name, title and photograph.\u2022Check the privacy settings to ensure you can receive messages from parties not in your contacts.\u2022Test your audiovisual equipment. Most virtual meeting platforms include features to test and adjust webcam or microphone settings as needed. Consider investing in external cameras or microphones if your equipment is not optimal (reverberation, poor resolution, etc.).\u2022Close the computer programs that you are not using during your interview to improve bandwidth during the meeting, which will improve video quality.\u2022Consider switching your status within the videoconference application to \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d to prevent interruptions by instant messaging or calls during interviews.\u2022Ensure a reliable internet connection. Plan for a backup such as a wired connection or cellular hotspot.\n",

We feature important steps to guide applicants to optimal performance on virtual interviews, a format which may not be familiar to many prospective trainees and programs alike. These videoconferencing adaptations may outlive the global infectious threat by playing a more prominent role in upcoming application cycles. In the future, we may see streamlining of this process by use of a centralized virtual interview platform for all fellowship programs or increased use of virtual meetings as a screening tool for in-person interviews. As these changes unfold, an evaluation of how implementation of videoconferencing technology in surgical fellowship matches may affect the selection process should be undertaken from both a programmatic and candidate standpoint.",
