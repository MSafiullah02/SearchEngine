            "text": "With the rapid spread of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), critical care physicians are seeing increasing numbers of patients with acute respiratory failure secondary to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and reporting mortality rates of 40\u201365% for those requiring mechanical ventilation1\u2014strikingly higher than the mortality rates reported for the more typical acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with other diseases.2 The focus of therapeutic intervention has therefore been not only to reverse hypoxaemia and provide adequate organ support, but also to decrease viral load and thus limit disease severity. In addition to several antiviral agents, antimalarial drugs have been proposed as treatments that could reduce transmission of the virus. In-vitro studies have shown that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can both inhibit SARS-CoV-2 transmission,3, 4, 5 through alkalinisation of the intracellular phagolysosome, which prevents virion fusion and uncoating and, therefore, viral spread. Early results from clinical studies conducted in China suggest that chloroquine use might have been associated with reduced fever, increased resolution of lung lesions on CT, and delayed disease progression.6, 7 Results of two French studies suggested that hydroxychloroquine could reduce the viral load in patients with COVID-19\u2014in particular, if combined with azithromycin8, 9 (table\n). On the basis of these preliminary findings, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been prescribed to patients to reduce the length of hospital stay and improve the evolution of COVID-19-related pneumonia. Nevertheless, the recently published Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines on the management of critically ill patients with COVID-19 concluded that there was insufficient evidence to offer any recommendation on the routine use of these drugs in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).10 How can we explain these discrepancies and how should antimalarial drugs be used in the clinical management of patients in the ICU with severe COVID-19?",

The first study reported by Philippe Gautret and colleagues,8 which indicated that hydroxychloroquine might be effective, had several limitations: a small cohort of patients, with only 20 participants who received hydroxychloroquine (six of whom received azithromycin) and 16 controls included in the final analysis; a very short observation period (6 days); absence of randomisation, raising concerns about selection bias and imbalance of baseline characteristics in the intervention and control groups; and no report of effects on clinical evolution (6 [17%] patients were asymptomatic and only 8 [22%] had pneumonia). The second French study, although larger, had no control arm.9 Moreover, the inclusion and exclusion criteria were poorly described, most patients (69 of 75 [92%]) had a low National Early Warning Score, and the overall clinical outcome was similar to that reported for untreated patients with COVID-19.11 The combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was associated with reduced viral load (83% and 93% tested negative on days 7 and 8, respectively), but no other clinically relevant outcomes were reported. In a trial in 30 patients with COVID-19, Jun Chen and colleagues found no significant difference in nasopharyngeal viral carriage on day 7 when hydroxychloroquine was compared with local standard of care; however, concomitant antivirals were given, which might have served as confounders when interpreting the results of this study.12 In a second Chinese trial in 62 patients, Zhaowei Chen and colleagues showed that hydroxychloroquine treatment was associated with a shorter time to clinical recovery (temperature and cough) than placebo;13 the participants had mild disease (SaO2/SpO2 >93% or PaO2/FiO2 >300) and it is not possible to extrapolate these results to critically ill patients. A study of 11 patients with COVID-19 reported persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in the nasopharyngeal swab in 8 of 10 patients receiving hydroxychloroquine.14\n",

International multicentre studies, such as the Discovery study (NCT04315948) and the Solidarity study (EudraCT Number 2020-000982-18), will randomise patients with COVID-19 to receive different antiviral drugs, including hydroxychloroquine, in an adaptive study design.

Assessing viral load, either on a nasopharyngeal swab or in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, might be of use in understanding whether targeting viral replication, rather than other injurious lung pathways, is a reasonable therapeutic strategy.
