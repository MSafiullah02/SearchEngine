            "text": "Among Earth\u2019s oceans, those in the Polar Regions are the smallest and most constrained, the Arctic Ocean encircled by landmasses and the Southern Ocean by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). The latter ocean is bounded to its north by the Antarctic Polar Front (APF), a well-known faunal barrier, and has a high degree of endemism among both vertebrates and invertebrates (e.g. Briggs, 1995, Eastman, 2013). Owing to dramatic annual cycles of heat and light, the productivity of the Southern Ocean is highly constrained on a seasonal basis, a characteristic that provides a generally challenging environment for the existence of organisms. Moreover, the high latitude Southern Ocean, i.e. that portion south of the Southern Boundary of the ACC (SBACC), is covered by sea ice for much of the year, in some places the entire year. Most of the birds and seals of a variety of species that inhabit that zone are endemic and resident, the most unvarying species assemblage found in Southern Hemisphere oceans; only a few migrant species augment that assemblage during summer (Ribic and Ainley, 1989). The species comprising this assemblage breed either on Antarctic islands (birds) or the sea ice that surrounds the continent (seals). In contrast, waters north of the SBACC host a much more speciose, seasonally varying seabird and marine mammal assemblage composed of species breeding on low latitude islands bordering the APF (Antarctic and sub-Antarctic) as well as seasonal migrants from more temperate regions (e.g. Ainley et al., 1994, Laws, 1977a, Laws, 1977b, Ribic and Ainley, 1989, Ribic et al., 2011). In accord with trends of diversity varying inversely with latitude, overall diversity of vertebrate species is low in the Southern Ocean, especially south of the SBACC, but populations are immense (e.g. Laws, 1977a, Laws, 1977b).",

Weddell seals colonize near-shore fast-ice regions feeding mainly on fish, while other Antarctic seals remain year round in the pack-ice composed of individual, often compacted floes. Crabeater seals feed principally on krill (Euphausia spp.), and Ross seals mostly on squid. Unlike the other Antarctic seals, leopard seals are solitary and highly predatory feeding on penguins and other seals as well as fish, krill and cephalopods (Siniff, 1981). Southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) occupy sub-Antarctic islands for breeding, then migrate south to Antarctica, some hauling out on land for moulting; Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) breed on peri-Antarctic islands, such as Macquarie, South Georgia and South Sandwich, as well as islands of the northern Antarctic Peninsula, around which they also hunt for krill and fish (Siniff et al., 2008).",

While mostly distributed to the north, populations of chinstrap, gentoo and macaroni penguins breed on islands of the northwestern Antarctic Peninsula, overlapping with Ad\u00e9lie penguins. Gentoo penguins are distributed as far as temperate waters surrounding the Falkland Islands, while macaroni penguins mainly colonize Heard and South Georgia islands in proximity to the APF (Trathan et al., 2016). Colonies of king penguins (A. patagonicus), royal penguins (E. schlegeli) and rockhopper penguins (E. chrysocome) are found on sub-Antarctic islands and do not inhabit the coastal Antarctic continent.

            "text": "Due to its zoogeographical isolation, introduction of pathogens and parasites to these populations of Antarctic wildlife, particularly the endemics of high latitude, may have detrimental effects. Understanding these potential effects required a knowledge of the entities circulating in the ecosystem. This concern drove interest toward detecting viruses, bacteria and parasites among Antarctic animals providing insight to their health. There have been a few reported cases of mass mortality where the disease-causing agent was undetermined. In 1971, several hundred gentoo penguin chicks at a Signey Island colony, South Orkneys, were found dead (MacDonald and Conroy, 1971). Although symptoms were described as similar to puffinosis coronavirus infection, no isolation of the disease agent was possible (Barbosa and Palacios, 2009). In 1972, about 65% of Ad\u00e9lie penguin chicks were reported dead in a colony near Mawson Station. In this case, penguins were found face down and apparently unable to walk or stand properly (Kerry et al., 2009). The cause of this disease was not determined. The only mass mortality reported in seals was the death of over 1500 crabeater seals in a colony around Crown Prince Gustav Channel, Antarctic Peninsula in 1955 (Laws and Taylor, 1957). Interestingly, Weddell seals in the area were unaffected and while the nature of this disease was unknown, a viral infection was suggested. Laws and Taylor (1957) noted that the population of seals in this area was almost ten times higher than normal and predicted that this crowding and partial starvation likely contributed to the effects of the disease.",

As lower latitude seabirds are infested with ticks (e.g. Lee and Baust, 1987), which are known to carry flaviviruses, this may indicate the transmission of tick-borne flaviviruses to seabirds, especially given the fact that a flavivirus was isolated from seabird ticks (Ixodes uriae) infecting king penguins on Macquarie Island (Major et al., 2009).",

While the human pathogenic virus, rubella virus, is the only known member of the single species in the genus Rubivirus to date (species Rubella virus), all animal togaviruses are classified as alphaviruses (Power et al., 2017). The life cycle of alphaviruses requires an arthropod vector, either a mosquito or tick, for transmission to their vertebrate host. The first instance of alphaviruses found in marine mammals was shown in southern elephant seals of Macquarie Island. Initially the seal alphavirus was isolated from the blood-sucking louse (Lepidophthirus macrorhini) that is widespread among southern elephant seals. However, a high seroprevalence of antibodies against the southern elephant seal alphavirus strongly indicated its transmission from lice to seals (La Linn et al., 2001). The full genome of this alphavirus (Southern elephant seal virus) was determined in a later study (Forrester et al., 2012).",

Seven genera are established in this family (Influenzavirus A, Influenazavirus B, Influenzavirus C, Influenzavirus D, Isavirus, Quaranjavirus and Thogotovirus) (McCauley et al., 2011). Influenza A virus is the only species in the genus Influenzavirus A, consisting of several pathogenic strains infecting humans, horses, pigs, whales, seals, birds and mink(McCauley et al., 2011). Influenza A virus strains are transmissible to humans and have caused worldwide endemics. This zoonotic nature of influenza viruses has led to extensive research on Influenza A virus. Antarctica continues to provide an interesting environment to study Influenza A viruses, especially in the case of migratory birds. For example, the South Polar skuas that breed on the Antarctic continent in the summer but move north, well into the Northern Hemisphere during the non-breeding season (Weimerskirch et al., 2015), thus act as potential vectors bringing in new variants and reassortants to Antarctica during each breeding season.",

Such research has indicated that influenza virus is highly widespread and prevalent in Antarctic birds. However, the pathogenicity of avian influenza virus in these populations is unknown. No genomic information for Influenza A viruses in Antarctic birds was available until Hurt et al.

With the exception of crabeater seals, both of these studies revealed low antibody titers against CDV and PDV. Several other studies looking at morbilliviruses in Antarctic seals have failed to detect any antibodies against these viruses (Harder et al., 1991, Osterhaus et al., 1988, Stenvers et al., 1992, Yochem et al., 2009). This may suggest morbilliviruses are not persistent in Antarctic seals or perhaps there are diverse morbilliviruses circulating amongst the pinnipeds that cannot be detected using conventional serology assays but likely to be identified using HTS approaches. Unlike avian paramyxoviruses, no genomic data are available for morbilliviruses from Antarctic seals and therefore impossible to tell if there was a spillover event from the canines to the pinnipeds.

South Polar skuas around Vestold Hills and Davis Station, East Antarctica, have also had high titer of antibodies against IBDV (Miller et al., 2008, Watts et al., 2009), however, a significant difference in seroprevalence between sampling periods during 1999\u20132002 was observed. A low titer and prevalence of antibodies to IBDV has been detected in king penguins around Possession Island, among the Crozet Islands along the APF (Gauthier-Clerc et al., 2002). High-titers of IBDV neutralizing antibodies detected in distant populations of penguins and South Polar skua around Antarctica suggests it is unlikely IBDV was introduced through disposal of chicken products around Mawson Station as previously suggested by Gardner et al. (1997). Given that IBDV infection has been commonly detected in other wild avian populations (Hollm\u00e9n et al., 2000, Kasanga et al., 2008, Ogawa et al., 1998), this virus may be naturally occurring among Antarctic birds (Watts et al., 2009). It is worth noting, however, that IBDV has yet to be isolated from Antarctic birds despite several studies detecting neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, it is difficult to address any questions about the diversity, evolution or transmission of this virus among Antarctic birds.",

Phylogenetic analyses have shown that avian polyomaviruses cluster together and have been classified under the genus Gammapolyomavirus. Avian polyomaviruses are known to cause inflammatory disease in birds, and can lead to disease of the skin and feathers and mortality in some species. The first polyomavirus identified in Antarctica was found in the feces of Ad\u00e9lie penguins at Cape Royds, Ross Island (Varsani et al., 2015) using a HTS-informed approach. Analysis of this genome shows that it falls in the avian polyomavirus lineage, representing a novel species (Pygoscelis adeliae polyomavirus 1).",

While research has focused on their diversity and significance in humans, anelloviruses have been identified in non-human primates, domesticated animals, rodents and recently in marine mammals. Analysis of lung tissue from a captive California sea lion showing signs of respiratory disease led to discovery of the first anellovirus among pinnipeds, Zalophus californianus anellovirus (ZcAV) (Ng et al., 2009). Since then several novel anellovirus genomes have been recovered in harbor seals (Bodewes et al., 2015, Bodewes et al., 2013). In lung samples of deceased harbor seals along the North American Pacific coast anelloviruses were identified over multiple years demonstrating the persistence of this infection in the population (Ng et al., 2011).

Analyses identified two novel anelloviruses, torque teno Leptonychotes weddellii virus (TTLwV-1, TTLwV-2). TTLwV-1 was additionally identified in South Polar skua faecal samples and it was thought that this was as a result of skuas feeding on the placenta and dead carcasses of Weddell seals in the area (Fahsbender et al., 2017).",

            "text": "Both ecto- and endoparasites have been reported among Antarctic animals. While neither appear to be detrimental to animal health, these organisms may play a significant role as vectors of viruses. Ticks, mites and lice commonly parasitize seals, penguins and other Antarctic birds (Gauthier-Clerc et al., 1998, Gonz\u00e1lez-Acu\u00f1a et al., 2013, McFarlane, 1996). Flaviviruses, orbiviruses, phleboviruses, and nairoviruses have been isolated from seabird ticks (Ixodes uriae) associated with king, rockhopper and royal penguins on Macquarie Island (Major et al., 2009). A novel alphavirus has also been isolated and partially sequenced from lice associated with southern elephant seals of Macquarie Island and the high seroprevalence in the southern elephant seal population showed to this virus strongly suggests its transmission by lice (La Linn et al., 2001). Gastrointestinal parasites, particularly cestode and nematode species, are commonly found in Antarctic seals and penguins. Penguins tend to have a low diversity of parasites and similar profiles have been identified among penguins of the same genus (Diaz et al., 2016, Diaz et al., 2013, Fonteneau et al., 2011, Kleinertz et al., 2014, Vidal et al., 2012). Of the Antarctic seals, gastrointestinal parasites are most prevalent among Weddell and leopard seals. Given that helminth parasites are strongly associated with the diet of the host they infect, this likely explains the higher abundance of parasites among Weddell and leopard seals compared to other Antarctic seals (McFarlane et al., 2009). The potential for endoparasites to transmit viruses to their host has been demonstrated by two genera of plant viruses, nepoviruses and tobraviruses, transmitted by nematodes (Hull, 2014). While our knowledge of parasites in Antarctic animals remains extremely limited and research in this area has been sporadic, developments in molecular technology will undoubtedly have a strong impact toward revealing relationships between organisms and the movement of viruses in the environment.",

Furthermore, in 2014 observations of an Ad\u00e9lie penguin colony at Hope Bay, Antarctica identified two chicks showing patches without feathers in two sub colonies (Barbosa et al., 2014). Beak and feather disease virus (family Circoviridae) infection in certain psittacines causes feather abnormalities and loss (Pass and Perry, 1984) and hence there is a likelihood that feather loss observed in penguins may be attributed to an unknown circovirus-like agent.",

This together with other studies that have identified large datasets of novel viruses using HTS (e.g. Dayaram et al., 2016, Labonte and Suttle, 2013, Rosario et al., 2015) has shown: 1) the HTS enabled identification of large numbers of previously unknown viruses; 2) we have barely scratched the surface of the viral sequence space and thus their diversity; 3) new taxa will need to be created to classify viruses at a rapid rate to match the pace of virus discovery. All this has opened up discussions on viral classification based on sequence data, either derived from Sanger sequencing or HTS, and lead to a consensus statement by Simmonds et al.

Novel viral genomes from various soils and lake samples (Dziewit and Radlinska, 2016, Kerepesi and Grolmusz, 2017, Meiring et al., 2012, Swanson et al., 2012, Zawar-Reza et al., 2014) have been determined using HTS approaches. In contrast, relatively little is known about viruses associated with Antarctic animals and the associated virus ecology despite the advent of HTS. This perhaps can be attributed to the difficulty in accessing/obtaining animal samples and longitudinal sampling for viral ecology studies. Nonetheless, various studies have used HTS to identify viruses associated with Antarctic animals (Table 2, Fig. 2\n) and we anticipate that the next decade will see a dramatic increase in virology activity and to some extent viral ecology studies of Antarctic animals. Furthermore, it is highly like that large numbers of diverse viruses will be identified using HTS. As sequencing technologies improve, there may be possibility of in-field identification of animal viral pathogens in Antarctica, e.g. using Oxford Nanopore Sequencer (ONS). ONS has been used for metagenomic studies of microbial mats from three lakes in the Antarctic dry valleys (Lakes Fryxell, Lake Vanda and Lake Vida) by Johnson et al.
