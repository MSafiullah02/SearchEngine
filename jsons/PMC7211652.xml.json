The incubation period is defined as time difference between contraction of the disease and symptoms onsets. The infectious period is the duration of which an infected individual can transmit pathogens to a susceptible host. In this study, the infectious period is defined as the time difference between date of infection and date of diagnosis as there is strong evidence showing that a diseased individual remains infectious even during the incubation period, and would be immediately isolated upon positive diagnosis hence losing the transmissibility. All are key quantities that depict an epidemic and are essential to estimate the basic/controlled reproductive number, R0/Rc. Among the 645 chains of transmission identified from 14,829 confirmed cases recorded outside Hubei Province as of March 31, 2020, very few of them have their dates of infection acquired, but 198 of them have their dates of symptoms onset available.

Note that the serial interval of SARS-nCoV in Hongkong was 8.4 days on average.4 In fact, the distribution of serial interval may be biased for estimating generation time, especially when the disease is infectious during incubation, in that the variance of generation time could be overestimated.5 In addition, a total of 169 cases in the collected data were able to identify the dates of infection according to the method described in previous section. The histogram of infectious period is in Fig. 1\nwhile the numerical summary is in Table 1. We acknowledge that isolation could occur before the date of diagnosis, suspected cases could be isolated without the formal positive results, hence infectious period could be potentially overestimated. Furthermore, incubation periods of these 169 cases can be identified. See Fig. 1 and Table 1 for the histogram and numerical summary for the incubation period.",

Wuhan was locked down on January 23, and the inter-provincial flow of people was greatly reduced (https://qianxi.baidu.com). which effectively controlled the exportation of infected individuals. Based on an average 13.91-day infectious period estimate from our collected data, we expect a flatter rate of increment starting from the end of January.

This is possibly due to the effective interventions and prompt actions by the local and central governments to minimize further spreading. We also notice that EGR yields smaller estimates of Rc compared to other methods.

Note that there were very few new cases confirmed outside Hubei province since March 1, 2020, hence we only updated Rc(t) up to February 29, 2020. For each Dayt, the number of daily reported new cases from Day t\u22129 to Dayt is used to estimate R\u02c6c(t). Fig. 3\nplots the estimated controlled reproduction number R\u02c6c(t) along with its 95% confidence interval (CI) for selected regions of China. Note that the estimated R\u02c6c(t) reflects the average spreading ability of the epidemic in a short period prior to Day t. As a result, the real-time Rc(t) might be overestimated if the general trend of Rc(t) is declining.",

We can see that outside Hubei province, Rc(t) dropped below 1 around February 11, 2020 while in Hubei Rc(t) fell below 1 around February 19, 2020, which indicate indicates that the containment measure carried out by Chinese government was effective and efficient. The controlled reproduction numbers Rc is now much lower than one in all regions of China for quite a time, however, it has yet reached zero. A possible explanation is that the number of foreign imported cases has grown significantly since late February, and posed a high risk of a second outbreak. Efforts are needed in order to end the current epidemic, especially improving quarantine measures at the border.",

The EGR method can be only used at the early period of an epidemic, when the number of confirmed cases grows exponentially. The SIR method is not able to provide a time-varying reproduction number, and as existing literature on COVID-19 showed that SIR model is likely to overestimate the basic reproduction number since a large proportion of susceptible cases were isolated due to the strong control measures implemented15,16,17. Hence, ML method is preferred in this study. Note that this study omits the effect of human mobility before the lockdown starting from January 23, 2020, which may cause an overestimation of the basic reproduction outside Hubei. A more realistic transmission model with spatial spread such as metapopulation disease model can be used but this is beyond the scope of this study.18.",

The criteria of confirmation have evolved from the original \u201cwhole genome sequencing of the respiratory excretion\u201d to \u201cpositive viral nucleic acid results by the RT-PCR of the respiratory excretion or viral gene sequence\u201d in the 5th edition, and, as of now, the inclusion of positive nucleic acid results of the blood sample. The confirmation process has been simplified by the removal of the accreditation process by the national expert committee for confirmed cases. The fourth edition of the official guidelines for diagnosis and treatment granted the accrediting authority to municipalities.19 In addition, the medical resources in Hubei province especially in Wuhan received a remarkable boost from early February 2020. All of these changes might result in a temporary surge of confirmed cases and lead to an overestimation of Rc during mid of February, especially in Hubei Province.",

However, other transmission pathways, including fecal-oral transmission and aerosol transmission, could not yet be excluded based on current evidence. If other transmission mechanisms do exist, the Rc values could increase in the future unless further measures would intersect these transmission pathways. China NHC have started to report the number of asymptomatic cases since April 1. The asymptomatic cases are typically hard to be detected. If asymptomatic cases are not isolated, there may be a second chance of outbreak. Note the incubation period, serial intervals and infectious period estimated in this study only apply to symptomatic patients. Furthermore, despite that the outbreak has been effectively contained currently in China, the number of imported cases will potentially grow with the development of global pandemic. As reported by China NHC, there are totally 788 confirmed imported cases and 4 domestic cases related to these imported cases during March 2020. In brief, the main goal of epidemic prevention in China has shifted from preventing the transmission of domestic confirmed cases to prevention of the spread of asymptomatic cases and foreign imported cases.",
