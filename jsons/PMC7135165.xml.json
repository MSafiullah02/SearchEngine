It includes extraterrestrial organic compounds present in carbonaceous chondritic meteorites and interplanetary dust particles, which seem to be related to cometary nuclei. However, there is no basis for the claim made by Wickramasinghe and colleagues that there is a daily influx of about 1 tonne of extraterrestrial microbes, which they assume corresponds to one hundredth of the daily infall of cometary material. The present dust infall is 4\u00d7107 kg per year and, although its organic composition is poorly understood, there is no evidence that it includes extraterrestrial prokaryotes or other forms of microbial life.3 The few individual molecules that have been characterised in interplanetary dust particles are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,4 none of which are bona-fide biosignatures. Although this material could have played a part in the origin of life, its connection with extant evolutionary processes is tenuous at best, and probably has no relevance in the appearance of infectious diseases.",

The organisms they found include two bacteria that are firmly placed within the bacillus and the staphylococcus clades on the basis of 16S rRNA sequence comparisons. The presence of these microbes at 41 km from the Earth's surface is consistent with the presence of different bacterial species and fungal spores collected from clouds,4 but cannot be evidence of an extraterrestrial origin. If life exists elsewhere in the Universe, it is extremely unlikely that it would have independently evolved macro-molecules, such as 16S rRNA, or other intracellular components homologous to those of their terrestrial counterparts. This would be especially true of viruses, whose dependence on the intracellular molecular machinery of their hosts to complete their biological cycles would make their survival and evolution within the terrestrial biosphere unlikely should they have an independent, extraterrestrial origin.",
