Guidelines are many, methods are different, attitudes show vide variations, routines and procedures are still changing, regulations by law may be absent, and some healthcare professionals may be afraid of adverse outcomes of isolation [1\u201344]. Microbes that are spread in the environment, on the hands and equipment are invisible. The invisible agent does not call on attention before the infection; clinical disease, hospital infection or nosocomial infection is a factum that can be registered [23, 28, 29, 35\u201337]. How to stop the transmission is often \u201cto believe and not believe\u201d in infection control.",

Quarantine (from Italian quaranta = 40) was introduced in Southern Europe ca. year 1400, to isolate presumed infectious ships, persons, goods, food and equipment from other places at quarantine stations for 40 days, i.e. double the incubation period for most serious infectious diseases, also in our time.",

Schools were closed intermittently during outbreaks, and posters were put on houses with infectious disease as a warning. Disinfection of houses, clothing and all of its contents was completed after the termination of the isolation period, using chlorine and sulphur smoke. Carbolic acid and hydrochloric acid were also used where sulphur fumes treatment failed. Bedding, clothing and fixtures that could not be washed or disinfected were often burned, with a financial compensation for this \u201coutlay.\u201d Patients who broke the isolation routines could be penalized and committed to further isolation.

After the intervention, the MDRO rate was significantly reduced, specially by the reduction of VRE. Isolated patients had at least the same good treatment quality as not isolated patients [67]. In Norway, cohort isolation was utilized in Trondheim during the first national outbreak of MRSA (1970\u20131974). A total of 144 patients were infected (including 15 personnel), and 48 died (31.6%) directly or indirectly from the hospital epidemic [68].

            "text": "The implementation of good isolation measures and compliance is often weakened by confusion, lack of written procedures, lack of training, competence and understaffing. A number of other factors also influence the attitude of healthcare professionals with regard to follow the hospital\u2019s infection control procedures, not least professional disagreement about the procedures.In emergency wards in the United States, only 45% of the wards used contact protection (gloves and gown) upon receipt of patients with diarrhoea or faecal incontinence, 84% for suspected CD, 49% for purulent skin infections, 79% for suspected MRSA and 63% by multiresistant gram-negative rods [21].It may be a big difference between what staff and others say they do and what happens in reality [82]. Among 470 persons who entered isolates, the compliance was higher by strict isolation infections (65%) than with other infectious conditions [83]. Visitors followed the measures better than personnel (88% versus 41%) [83]. The compliance with isolation procedures increased significantly when more time was spent with the patient, being a visitor, and when the patient was on a strict isolation [83]. The study pointed out the danger of increased demands for doctors and nurses due to savings can result in adverse effects such as reduced compliance with key routines as isolation [83]. Morgan et al. observed 7750 visits of a healthcare professional to isolated and non-isolated patients. Patients on contact isolation had 36% fewer visits and 18% less contact, and there were fewer visitors than non-isolated patients [84]. However, the staff implemented significantly more frequent handwashing after visit in isolates, 63%, than by visits with non-isolated patients, 47% [84].During the MRSA outbreak with ca 150 patients in Trondheim, Norway, 1970\u20131974, Kvittingen et al. described problems that may occur during epidemic and endemic conditions as \u201cdoctors more or less wholehearted support and scepticism to the measures made by the Hygiene Committee, discussions concerning the virulence and resistance development, what to do when a local outbreak paralyzes the department completely, information problems, lack of qualified personnel, etc.\u201d [68, 85]. They stressed that \u201clarger hospitals should dispose well-planned isolation opportunities, both for patients who are infectious spreaders and perhaps equally important, to protect patients with reduced infection defence,\u201d and that \u201cpersonnel in management positions (should) provide effective and loyal support for infection control personnel\u201d [68].This was a very important observation done for more than 40 years ago. It is still causing major problems during outbreaks and endemic situations when there may be a choice between shortcut thoughts about \u201ceconomy\u201d and infection control. Still, impression and experience is that staff working directly with the patients have great respect for contact and airborne routines, at least in Norway.",

The isolates must be of good quality and design, and it should be enough airborne infection isolation units [19].",

Ransj\u00f8 et al. attached the importance to the activity of the hospital management during outbreaks of multidrug-resistant microbes in Sweden [87]. In Norway, an outbreak of VRE by a dialysis department spring 2011, at Ullev\u00e5l University Hospital, was expected from the department\u2019s critical building condition [23]. After great effort from the staff, the outbreak stopped within 14 days [23]. A structural rehabilitation started then, with expansion of bed numbers, assisted by the hospital management. One year later, all patients were VRE negative [23]. A number of outbreaks at Ullev\u00e5l\u2019s premature intensive care unit during years have been linked to chronic understaffing, overcrowding, part-time work, lack of infection control practices and isolates, lack of information and a lack of management responsibilities [24, 37].",

By massive contamination and poor routines for washing equipment and hospital textiles, this may cause a special problem of re-aerosols [105].Construction activity of all types without measures against airborne infection is influencing the airborne spread of bacteria, virus and fungi. This must be taken into account when rebuilding and repairing buildings and ventilation ducts etc. [22, 105]. If ignored, it may cause large problems like the outbreak of Bacillus cereus among 171 patients, most with sepsis, during 6 months of a large construction project next to the hospital [105].

Category IA/IC.Provide at least six (existing facility) or 12 (new construction/renovation) air changes per hour.Direct exhaust of air to the outside. If it is not possible to exhaust air from an AIIR directly to the outside, the air may be returned to the air-handling system or adjacent spaces if all air is directed through HEPA filters.Whenever an AIIR is in use for a patient on Airborne Precautions, monitor air pressure daily with visual indicators (e.g., smoke tubes, flutter strips), regardless of the presence of differential pressure sensing devices (e.g., manometers).Keep the AIIR door closed when not required for entry and exit.When an AIIR is not available, transfer the patient to a facility that has an available AIIR. Category II.In the event of an outbreak or exposure involving large numbers of patients who require Airborne Precautions:Consult infection control professionals before patient placement to determine the safety of alternative room that do not meet engineering requirements for an AIIR.Place together (cohort) patients who are presumed to have the same infection(based on clinical presentation and diagnosis when known) in areas of the facility that are away from other patients, especially patients who are at increased risk for infection (e.g., immune-compromised patients).Use temporary portable solutions (e.g., exhaust fan) to create a negative pressure environment in the converted area of the facility. Discharge air directly to the outside, away from people and air intakes, or direct all the air through HEPA filters before it is introduced to other air spaces. Category II.Place the patient in an AIIR as soon as possible. If an AIIR is not available, place a surgical mask on the patient and place him/her in an examination room. Once the patient leaves, the room should remain vacant for the appropriate time, generally 1 h, to allow for a full exchange of air. Category IB/IC.Instruct patients with a known or suspected airborne infection to wear a surgical mask and observe Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette. Once in an AIIR, the mask may be removed; the mask should remain on if the patient is not in an AIIR. Category IB/IC.Restrict susceptible healthcare personnel from entering the rooms of patients known or suspected to have measles (rubeola), varicella (chickenpox), disseminated zoster, or smallpox if other immune healthcare personnel are available. Category IB.Wear a fit-tested NIOSH-approved N95 or higher level respirator for respiratory protection when entering the room or home of a patient when the following diseases are suspected or confirmed:Infectious pulmonary or laryngeal tuberculosis or when infectious tuberculosis skin lesions are present and procedures that would aerosolize viable organisms (e.g., irrigation, incision and drainage, whirlpool treatments) are performed. Category IB.Smallpox (vaccinated and unvaccinated) --- Category II.No recommendation is made regarding the type of personal protective equipment (i.e., surgical mask or respiratory protection with a N95 or higher respirator) to be worn by susceptible healthcare personnel who must have contact with patients with known or suspected measles, chickenpox or disseminated herpes zoster. Unresolved issue.In acute care hospitals and long-term care and other residential settings, limit transport and movement of patients outside of the room to medically-necessary purposes. Category II.If transport or movement outside an AIIR is necessary, instruct patients to wear a surgical mask, if possible, and observe Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette. Category II.For patients with skin lesions associated with varicella or smallpox or draining skin lesions caused by M. tuberculosis, cover the affected areas to prevent aerosolization or contact with the infectious agent in skin lesions. Category IB.Healthcare personnel transporting patients who are on Airborne Precautions do not need to wear a mask or respirator during transport if the patient is wearing a mask and infectious skin lesions are covered. Category II.Exposure management immunize or provide the appropriate immune globulin to susceptible persons as soon as possible following unprotected contact (i.e., exposed) to a patient with measles, varicella or smallpox: Category IA.Administer measles vaccine to exposed susceptible persons within 72 h after the exposure or administer immune globulin within 6 days of the exposure event for high-risk persons in whom vaccine is contraindicated.Administer varicella vaccine to exposed susceptible persons within 120 h after the exposure or administer varicella immune globulin (VZIG or alternative product), when available, within 96 h for high-risk persons in whom vaccine is contraindicated (e.g., immune compromised patients, pregnant women, newborns whose mother\u2019s varicella onset was <5 days before or within 48 h after delivery.Administer smallpox vaccine to exposed susceptible persons within 4 days after exposure.\u201d Citation ended.",

The WHO, United Kingdom and CDC defined Ebola as non-airborne infection in 2014 and still does the same in 2017 [121]. None of these recommended respiratory protection for suspected Ebola infection in August\u2013September 2014, at least half a year after the start of the epidemic.
