The XPS technique showed changes in chemical composition on the film surface, resulting in the detection of nitrogen (2.6%) and an increased percentage of oxygen (initially from 6.7% to 13.3% after oxidation and 19.4% after functionalization). The oxygen increase was due to the presence of carboxylic acid after chromic oxidation.

The water vapor barrier property of the packaging can be determined by calculating the water vapor permeability (WVP) or the water vapor transmission rate (WVTR). Both parameters cover the determination of the passage of water vapor through a polymeric material. However, the WVP considers vapor pressure difference between 2 specific surfaces (internal and external) of the analyzed packaging (ASTM 2010b). Both parameters, WVP as well as WVTR, have been used to indicate that the addition of nisin in different polymeric matrixes, such as LDPE film coated with a cellulose\u2010based solution (Grower and others 2004; Massani and others 2008), sodium caseinate films (Kristo and others 2008) and PE\u2010film coated with HPMC (Chollet and others 2009), causes no significant changes in the water vapor barrier property.",

Several factors must be considered when studying the migration from antimicrobial packaging, including the release rate of the antimicrobial molecules from the packaging. If this rate is high, the active packaging would release the antimicrobial rapidly, resulting in a large concentration at a determined time. However, the large concentration would not be maintained over time, depending on the solubility of the antimicrobial in the selected food. If the solubility is very high, the antimicrobial will migrate rapidly to the food matrix, and therefore result in a decreased concentration of the antimicrobial on the food's surface along time. On the other hand, if the release rate is low, the antimicrobial agent will be slowly released in a desired concentration and if it presents a low solubility in the selected food, the antimicrobial can accumulate on the food surface and slowly migrate into the food matrix. In this situation the release rate should not be slower than the microbial growth (Bastarrachea and others 2011).",
