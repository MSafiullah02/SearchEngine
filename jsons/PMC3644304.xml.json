Although conventional vaccination strategies, based on inactivated virus or on the use of life attenuated strains, have been instrumental in the control and even eradication of some important animal and human infectious diseases, in many other cases they fail to deliver the required levels of immunogenicity, safety, cross-protection across the pathogens antigenic variability, or even exacerbate disease. Therefore, new strategies have been explored to obtain safer more effective vaccines (Table 1\n).Box 1Potential challenges in the development of vaccines against an emerging virus.\n\u2022Incomplete information: our knowledge about an emerging pathogen can be limited for several reasons: it is a recently discovered virus; outbreaks are uncommon and there are few reported natural outbreaks; important immunological parameters such us correlates for protection, antigenic variability or immunodominant antigens are unknown. In addition, for highly variable viruses, the particular strain that will cause the next outbreak or pandemic might be unpredictable.\u2022Virulence and bio-safety requirements: some emerging viruses have high mortality rates, with no treatment or prophylaxis available, and must be manipulated under maximum (BSL-4) bio-safety conditions. For this type of viruses, using life attenuated strains or inactivated vaccines (that require the growth of large amounts of virus) are not acceptable options. Similar concerns apply to veterinary vaccines against highly contagious viruses to be used in disease-free countries.\u2022Lack of appropriate animal models: vaccine candidates need to be pre-clinically tested in animal models for safety, immunogenicity and efficacy (protection). The ideal animal model should have a well-known immune system and similar susceptibility and immune responses to the pathogen as the natural host. Other important considerations are prize, size, possibility to use large numbers, or ethical considerations.\u2022Possibility to Differentiate between Infected and Vaccinated Animals (DIVA or marker vaccines) is highly desired in veterinary vaccines against pathogens that are subject to trade restrictions.\u2022The time required to develop, validate, mass-produce and deliver a new vaccine should ideally be as short as possible. This could be facilitated by the use of well-known vaccine platforms that have already been tested and validated against similar pathogens.\u2022Vaccines to be used to control an ongoing outbreak should be stockpiled in advance or produced very rapidly, and induce protection after a single administration and short time after inoculation.\n",

In addition to safety, recombinant protein vaccines can have additional advantages: First, production does not require the manipulation of the pathogen, avoiding the risk of accidental escape and the hurdles of high bio-safety and bio-containment requirements. Second, vaccine candidates can be designed even when there is limited information about the pathogen. Third, also, subunit vaccines can be used to overcome the natural immuno-dominance of highly variable epitopes and direct the immune responses against conserved and broadly protective epitopes. Fourth, since individual antigens elicit responses that are different from the response induced by natural infection these vaccine strategies could be used as DIVA (Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals) vaccines with the accompanying serological test.",

Vaccines that provide long-lived protection across several IAV subtypes, also known as \u2018universal influenza vaccines\u2019 would avoid the need for annual vaccination, and continuous re-formulation of the vaccine to match the circulating strains, and would protect against animal IAVs and future pandemic strains [6\u2022\u2022, 7, 8]. A recombinant protein vaccine (STF2.4xM2e) containing the highly conserved extracellular domain of the IAV M2 protein (M2e) has demonstrated safety and immunogenicity in a Phase I clinical trial. To increase immunogenicity, the M2e sequence was expressed in four tandem copies and fused to flagellin, a TLR5 ligand acting as adjuvant [9\u2022]. Wang and colleagues used a synthetic peptide from the conserved stalk region of the IAV hemagglutinin (HA) protein (Figure 1\n), coupled to the carrier protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). Vaccination with two doses of peptide induced cross-reactive antibodies and protected mice against lethal challenge with different subtypes of IAV [10\u2022]. Other approaches include the fusion of the antigen to dendritic cell targeting/activating molecules [11]. While this strategy should result in delivery of the antigen to an antigen presenting cell in the appropriate stimulatory context, further investigation is required to understand the best targeting sequences resulting in high immunogenicity and lack of reactogenicity.",

Mice immunized with these headless HA VLPs induced broadly reactive antibodies against the conserved stalk region of HA and were protected from challenge with a lethal dose of the homologous virus [13]. The influenza virus M2e antigen has been conjugated to the hepatitis virus core protein which self assembles into VLPs (ACAM-FLU-A [14]) and demonstrated safety and immunogenicity in Phase I clinical trials. A similar approach was used to fuse the M2e sequence to the norovirus capsid protein that self-assembles into VLPs. Interestingly, the chimeric VLPs induced responses against both IAV and norovirus [15]. M2 containing VLPs were also obtained by co-expressing the full length M2 protein with IAV M1 protein [16]. Alternative to VLPs, several groups have described multimeric M2e strategies that increase its immunogenicity [17\u2022, 18, 19, 20].",

In 2009 an experimental vaccine candidate was used as post-exposure emergency prophylaxis on a researcher, after accidental puncture with a needle containing Zaire EBOV. After consultation with experts from several countries, the chosen vaccine was a recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) expressing the EBOV envelope glycoprotein (GP) and it was administered 48 hours after exposure. The person developed antibodies against the vector and the GP protein, but not against other EBOV proteins. In addition, vector but not EBOV RNA was detected in the patient's serum [30\u2022\u2022]. A replication defective recombinant adenovirus (rAd5) expressing EBOV GP elicits complete protection after a single inoculation in non-human primates [31] and has shown safety and immunogenicity in humans [32\u2022].

Antigen is expressed in vivo and induces both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Large quantities of DNA can be produced in short time at a reduced cost, and DNA preparations are more stable than other types of vaccines, both very desirable properties for a vaccine that must be used in remote areas. Furthermore, DNA vaccines are considered very safe, they are suitable for DIVA applications and they are not affected by anti-vector immunity. The main limitation in the development of DNA vaccines is their intrinsic low immunogenicity. Therefore, great research effort has been invested in the improvement of immunogenicity by more efficient delivery approaches, such as gene gun, skin tattooing, or electroporation; targeting to immune effector cells and the use of potent adjuvants, either co-administered with the vaccine or encoded in the same plasmid.

Several novel vaccination strategies that have been developed in recent years can specifically address these challenges. Subunit vaccines, containing only part of the pathogen's antigens, can elicit protective responses that are different from those induced in the infected animal. Because they contain no infectious pathogen, there is no need for high bio-safety measures, risk of accidental escape during production, residual pathogenesis, or reversion to virulence in the vaccinated individuals. The use of well-defined vaccine platforms, with an extensive record of safety and efficacy against similar pathogens can speed-up the process of development, validation and production of vaccines against new emerging and potentially emerging viruses. However, many challenges still lay ahead. Specifically, each vaccine platform has advantages and disadvantages mainly related to their balance between safety and immunogenicity, and ability to be used multiple times. Studies that compare multiple platforms in humans are still lacking. Future research will be needed for the improvement of the safety and immunological characteristics of vaccination strategies.",
