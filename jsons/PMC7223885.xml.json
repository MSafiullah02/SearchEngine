It causes annual epidemics and from time to time pandemics, both resulting in significant increase in morbidity and mortality [1]. Due to fast replicative cycle, ability to reassort the fragments of segmented genome and lack of correcting activity of viral polymerase influenza virus can quickly select mutants that do not match the virus-inhibiting antibodies and can therefore escape from the immune response [2]. Several classes of chemically distinct compounds are currently used for treatment of influenza: amantadine and rimantadine (two blockers of M2 proton channel) [3, 4], four neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir and laninamivir) prevent budding of viral progeny [5], umifenovir (Arbidol) is used against influenza in Russia and China [6, 7], pyrazinecarboxamide derivative favipiravir (T-705) was approved for stockpiling for potential treatment of pandemic influenza [8, 9], and baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza\u00ae) that has been recently approved by FDA interferes with endonuclease activity of viral PA subunit of polymerase complex [10].",

Indeed, all current isolates of influenza virus are resistant to adamantane derivatives so that WHO does not recommend their use for treatment of influenza anymore [10\u201312]. In 2007\u20132009 almost total resistance of seasonal influenza A(H1N1) viruses to oseltamivir was achieved. These strains were further replaced with oseltamivir-susceptible pandemic influenza viruses A(H1N1)pdm09 [13, 14]. Taken together, these facts suggest that novel anti-influenza drugs of alternative mechanism(s) of activity and viral target(s) are therefore of high priority for medicinal science and health care.",

Camphoric acid is a cyclopentane derivative containing two carboxylic acid functional groups on the first and third carbon atoms. The C-1 atom has an additional methyl group, thereby converting camphoric acid into an enantiomeric ditopic organic linker with different coordination regimes. Moreover, the coordination chemistry of camphoric acid specifically gives rise to many interesting chiral features applicable to both materials and life sciences, such as asymmetrical synthesis or crystallization, homochiral structural design, chiral induction, absolute helical control and ligand handedness [15]. There are examples of the use of camphoric acid derivatives as ligands [16\u201318].",

This technique led to an almost quantitative conversion to 3 after 2 h with 80% yield. Product 3 was not observed, if refluxing the starting reagents was carried out without a solvent, apparently due to the low boiling point of the starting amine 2. Also we used toluene, DMSO and o-xylene as a solvent for this interaction. It should be noted that using toluene or xylene significantly increased the conversion time to 24 h. The use of DMSO as a solvent resulted in a double decrease in the desired product. Thus, using phenol as a solvent proved to be the most optimal for the production of the tricyclic product 3.",

We have previously shown that various derivatives of monoterpenoids, in particular compounds including a 1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptane scaffold and N-heterocyclic fragment, exhibit antiviral properties against the influenza virus [39, 40]. In this regard, the obtained derivatives were screened for their inhibitory activity against influenza virus A H1N1. For each compound, the values of 50% cytotoxic dose (CC50), 50% virus-inhibiting dose (IC50) and selectivity index (SI) were calculated. The results are shown in Table 1. Adamantane- and norbornane-based derivatives were used as reference compounds due to their close similarity to the compounds under investigation in having rigid cage fragments in their structures. It is worth noting that compounds 3, 6, 10b, 12b, 14 are less cytotoxic than reference compounds. Compounds 3, 6, 10b, 14 are most effective in inhibiting the influenza virus A (H1N1) and can be used for further studies this type of activity. We believe that aliphatic polycyclic compounds (with a similar structure to compounds 3, 6) or compounds containing an additional aromatic cycle may exhibit potentially high antiviral activity, but in this case, we are particularly interested in the isomers with the hem-dimethyl bridge directed upwards.",
