            "text": "During prevention and control of the epidemic, the Nursing Department, as one of the main functional departments of the hospital, has broken the conventional operation mode and implemented contingency management strategies based on clinical practice, ensuring timely, orderly, safe, and efficient centralized rescue. After several tests of SARS, H1N1, H7N9, Ebola in West Africa, and COVID-19, a set of perfect emergency system should be established to deal with public health emergencies based on contingency management strategies in the future. Prospective training and exercises, establishing a talent echelon for all kinds of public events based on the current comprehensive emergency echelon mainly composed of head nurses, and standardizing processes in new hospital areas and new wards should be considered. Contingency plans should be regularly rehearsed and continuously improved.",
