            "text": "The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease had burst out in Wuhan China, specifically in December 2019. COVID-19 has caused by a new virus that had not been identified in human previously. This was followed by a widespread and rapid spread of this epidemic throughout the world. Daily, the number of the confirmed cases are increasing rapidly, number of the suspect increases, based on the symptoms that accompany this disease, and unfortunately number of the deaths also increase. Therefore, with these increases in number of cases around the world, it becomes hard to manage all these cases information with different situations; if the patient either injured or suspect with which symptoms that appeared on the patient. Therefore, there is a critical need to construct a multi-dimensional system to store and analyze the generated large-scale data. In this paper, a Comprehensive Storing System for COVID-19 data using Apache Spark (CSS-COVID) is proposed, to handle and manage the problem caused by increasing the number of COVID-19 daily. CSS-COVID helps in decreasing the processing time for querying and storing COVID-19 daily data. CSS-COVID consists of three stages, namely, inserting and indexing, storing, and querying stage. In the inserting stage, data is divided into subsets and then index each subset separately. The storing stage uses set of storing-nodes to store data, while querying stage is responsible for handling the querying processes. Using Apache Spark in CSS-COVID leverages the performance of dealing with large-scale data of the coronavirus disease injured whom increase daily. A set of experiments are applied, using real COVID-19 Datasets, to prove the efficiency of CSS-COVID in indexing large-scale data.",

            "text": "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [1] is an infection disease that firstly reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019 and then rapidly spreading across all over the world. This virus was previously named as 2019-nCoV and it is a positive, enveloped, single-strand RNA virus. It also shares a lot of similarities with two other coronaviruses, the MERS-COV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) and SARS-COV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) [6] . China officially declared the epidemic as an outbreak on January 20 when obvious human-to-human transmissions were ascertained with reagent probes and primers distributed to local agencies on that day. Immediately following the declaration, massive actions were taken the next day to curb the epidemic at Wuhan, and soon spread to the whole country from central to local government, including all sectors from business to factories and to schools [6] . On February 23, 2020, Wuhan City and other cities along with the main traffic lines around Wuhan were locked down. Rigorous efforts were devoted to 1) identify the infected and bring them to treatment in hospitals for infectious diseases, 2) locate and quarantine all those who had contact with the infected, 3) sterilize environmental pathogens, 4) promote mask use, and 5) release to the public of number of infected, suspected, under treatment and deaths on a daily basis. COVID-19 is of critical concern for public health [7] [8] [9] . Health care providers should be updated regarding public health and COVID-19 outbreaks affecting their communities to promptly make correct decisions [9, 10] . This would enable them to offer improved services in an efficient manner, which is crucial in the current situation [9] .",

As that obvious in the figure below,our proposal improves the querying time required for range query using different dataset size. We apply a range start with small range of radius r until large value of radius r. In this experiment, the small radius r is represented as a small village named Shyann City in Hubei province, China, while the large radius r represented as all the Injured people overall the China country.
