There is a requirement for the introduction of various advance technologies to tackle various problems related to this viral pandemic. Industry 4.0 is also known as the fourth industrial revolution, which consists of advance manufacturing and information technologies, to fulfil the customised requirement of different areas of the human being in lesser time. These technologies provide wireless connectivity in the manufacturing and service sector to enhance automation. In the fully implemented scenario of Industry 4.0, we see all these technologies are connected, and medical stakeholders communicate with each other for manufacturing and use of the vaccine, healthcare equipment & logistics, checkup, surveillance, detection and deciding necessary actions with lesser human physical involvement. The proper updates on the gathering of people are provided by the data captured by the advance technologies [1, 2] . Industry 4.0 factories have machines which are supported by wireless connectivity and sensors. These sensors are connected to a system that can visualise and monitor the entire production line and can also make its own decisions. Industry 4.0 uses smart manufacturing processes for the manufacturing of essential disposable items to fulfil the shortage of COVID-19 pandemic. It provides a smart supply chain of medical disposables and equipment during this crisis by which the patients can receive the required essential medical items, in time [3, 4] . Industry 4.0 is a smart system, used as a flexible production line for almost entire production processes real-time information provided by Artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT) and other digital technologies. Designing and development of any medical part are done rapidly using advance designing software and further used digital manufacturing technologies like 3D printing to print the required parts [5, 6] .",

It can be helpful to the epidemiologists for searching patient zero and also in identifying the persons coming in contact with the patients. In the times of COVID-19 outbreak, the technology of virtual reality offers a great option to video calls. The most significant benefit of this medium is its ability to make people feel like they are together in the same space without the need for travelling. The extra benefit is that people can entirely focus on the task in hand without any distractions at all. VR improves efficiency, upgrades the working in a group, reduce the travel costs, reduce the absenteeism and lowers the impact of the environment. So, in this time of COVID-19 disease, VR has been an excellent tool for communication and collaboration. 5 During the present times of lockdown in COVID-19 pandemic, an autonomous police robot can be deployed for patrolling the areas to confirm that the people are following the orders of lockdown. The autonomous police robots may also be deployed in the hospitals in order to help the medical staff to perform their duties without any disruption. It can be very helpful to enhance the performance of the medical staff and in turn, to contain the spread of the COVID-19.",
