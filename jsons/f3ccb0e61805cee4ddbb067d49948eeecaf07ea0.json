Our analysis exploits the fact that the epidemic was more advanced in some regions than in others when certain lockdown measures came into force, based on measuring health outcomes relative to the region-specific start of the epidemic and comparing outcomes across regions with earlier and later start dates. When estimating the effect of the relative timing of measures, we control for regional characteristics and initial epidemic trends by linear regression (Germany and Switzerland), doubly robust estimation (Germany), or synthetic controls (Switzerland). We find for both countries that a relatively later exposure to the measures entails higher cumulative hospitalization and death rates on region-specific days after the outbreak of the epidemic, suggesting that an earlier imposition of measures is more effective than a later one. For Germany, we also evaluate curfews (as introduced in a subset of states) based on cross-regional variation. We do not find any effects of curfews on top of the federally imposed contact restriction that banned groups of more than 2 individuals. Finally, an analysis of mobility patterns in Switzerland shows an immediate behavioral effect of the lockdown in terms of reduced mobility.",

            "text": "In both countries, the federal governments implemented extensive lockdown measures, including the closure of non-essential shops, schools, childcare centers, cafes, bars and restaurants. In Germany, these measures were further enhanced with a ban on gatherings with more than two people decided at federal level and curfews implemented in several states. With the measures in place for some weeks, both countries report a flattening of the COVID-19 epidemic curve. This alone, however, does not necessarily exclusively reflect the impact of the measures, but likely also general time trends in the spread of the virus. For this reason, this study aims to provide evidence about the causal effects of the German and Swiss measures by exploiting variation (i) in their relative timing due the fact that the epidemic was more advanced in some regions than in others when certain measures came into force and (ii) across regions due to the fact that some measures were only introduced in a subset of regions. In contrast to such simulations, in which empirical data serve for calibrating parameters in prediction models, a growing literature applies policy evaluation methods as outlined in Imbens & Wooldridge (2009) to assess the effectiveness of lockdown measures based on variation across regions and over time. Qiu et al. (2020) for instance investigate the influence of socioeconomic factors and COVID-19 response measures on transmission dynamics in China, finding that measures at a local level have a larger impact on the epidemic curve than restricting population flows between cities. Juranek & Zoutman (2020) use an event-study approach to assess the effect of the lockdown measures of Denmark and Norway on hospitalizations based on a comparison with Sweden whose measures are comparably lenient. Results suggest that the peak number of hospitalizations would have more than doubled in Denmark and Norway had they followed Sweden's strategy. Dave et al. (2020) use a difference-in-differences approach to evaluate lockdown measures (namely shelter in place orders) in the US by exploiting variation in responses across states and over time. As a consequence of the measures, they find an important increase (of 5 -10%) in the rate at which state residents remained in their homes full-time as well as substantial reductions in cumulative COVID-19 cases (44% after three weeks), 1 with early adopting states with a high population density benefitting most. See also Fowler et al. (2020) for a related difference-in-differences strategy for the US that suggests reductions in infections, too, as well as in fatalities. Results in Friedson et al. (2020) , who use a synthetic control approach to analyse the measures' effectiveness in California, point in the same direction.",

This suggests that an earlier imposition of measures is more effective than a later one w.r.t. our health outcomes. For Germany with its substantially larger number of observations, we also estimate the effect of the relative timing based on doubly robust (DR) estimation, see Robins et al. (1994) and Robins & Rotnitzky (1995) , which is a more flexible approach than exclusively relying on a linear outcome model. For Switzerland, we also consider the synthetic control method, see Abadie & Gardeazabal (2003) and Abadie et al. (2010) , to assess for two selected cantons with a relatively late exposure what their counterfactual outcomes would have been under an earlier exposure. Both the DR and synthetic control methods corroborate the findings of the linear regression. For Germany only, we also evaluate the effect of curfews that were introduced by a subset of German states in addition to the federal lockdown measures and bans of gatherings with more than two individuals. Exploiting this cross-sectional variation while controlling for observed characteristics, neither linear regression nor DR estimation suggest that curfews further reduce hospitalizations and fatalities under the lockdown measures already in place. Finally, we investigate how mobility patterns in Switzerland changed after the lockdown measures by means of a t-test that is applied to canton-specific mobility statistics and find an immediate behavioral change in terms of reduced mobility.",

Sections 3 and 4 describe the data and econometric methods used in the analyses. Section 5 presents and interprets the results. Section 6 concludes. In Switzerland, the first COVID-19 response measure, a ban of events with more than 1000 visitors, was announced and implemented at the federal level on February 28th when there were some 25 confirmed COVID-19 cases (0.03 per 10,000 inhabitants) in Switzerland. Several measures at the cantonal level followed. For instance, many cantons introduced a ban on visits to retirement homes. Some 2.5 weeks after the first measure was implemented, the Federal Council decided to close all schools and childcare centers in Switzerland as well as non-essential shops, cafes, bars, and restaurants on March 16th. In the following, we will refer to these measures as lockdown measures. At that point in time, the rate of confirmed infections in Switzerland was at 4.2 per 10,000 inhabitants. The schedule of response measures in the Principality of Liechtenstein (LI) was similar to that in Switzerland with the lockdown entering into force two days later. Due to the two countries' similar schedules of COVID-19 response measures, their geographic proximity and their economic, cultural and political interconnection, we include LI as additional data point when investigating the impact of the lockdown measures in Switzerland.",

The same may apply to the measurement of fatalities, i.e. the definition of criteria according to which a decease is attributed to COVID-19. If such measurement issues in health outcomes are not systematically associated with the region-specific start date of the epidemic (or more generally, with the policy interventions considered), they do not bias the results of our analysis. However, if for instance regions with an earlier start date and a more advanced epidemic systematically applied more stringent rules for hospital admissions (e.g. to prevent capacity constraints), this could also entail an underestimation of COVID-19 fatalities due to underreporting deceases at home. In this case, our analysis of the relative timing of measures presented below would likely provide a lower bound of the true effect on (capacity-unconstraint) hospitalizations and fatalities.",

(2011) for the statistical software 'R', where the weights depend on how close their characteristics and pre-treatment outcomes match the values of the reference canton with the later exposure. The control pool includes all in all 11 cantons that reached 1 confirmed infection per 10,000 inhabitants at most 3 days before the lockdown. Figure 3 reports the mean differences in cumulative fatalities per 10,000 inhabitants between either treatment group and the early intervention group (reference group) per day up to 28 days after the county-specific start date (solid lines) based on the OLS approach. 3 It also includes 90% confidence intervals (dashed lines). The mean differences in fatality rates between the late and the early intervention groups (left) remain close to zero during the first 2.5 weeks of the countyspecific epidemic but show a positive and statistically significant tendency thereafter. The point estimates suggest that after one month, fatalities per 10,000 inhabitants are reduced by 0.7 cases under an earlier lockdown. Also the difference in death rates between the intermediate and the early intervention groups are statistically significant at the 10 percent level, but (expectedly) smaller in magnitude. Overall, the results suggest that the relative timing of measures had a perceptible impact on COVID19-related fatalities in Germany. We note that Appendix C provides the OLS specification with the full list of coefficients on treatments and covariates along with standard errors 28 days after the start of the epidemic. Concerning the robustness of our findings, we note that estimations without controlling for observed covariates yield qualitatively similar results, see Appendix D). Furthermore, the left graph in Figure 6 provides the OLS-based effects of curfews relative to contact restrictions, i.e. bans of gatherings with more than 2 persons, under all other lockdown measures already in place. The estimates have a positive sign, which appears counter-intuitive as curfews are more restrictive than contact restrictions, but are never statistically significantly different from zero throughout the evaluation window which starts on March 23rd and ends 35 days later. The same finding applies to estimation results based on DR, which are shown in the right graph of Figure 6 . Therefore, we do not find evidence that curfews are more effective than banning groups for reducing fatality rates. Figure 7 reports the OLS estimates of the mean differences in cumulative hospitalizations (left) and fatalities (right) per 10,000 inhabitants between the late and the early intervention groups up to 44 days after the start of the canton-specific epidemic (solid line), as well as 90% confidence intervals (dashed lines). See Appendix C for the full OLS specification with the coefficients on treatments and covariates on the last day of the evaluation window and fatalities as outcome variable. We note that the canton of Ticino is excluded from this analysis due to its comparably strong economic and social ties with Northern Italy (which was particularly severely affected by the COVID19 crisis), as this could arguably have affected the canton's hospitalizations and fatalities. However, our findings are quite similar when including Ticino in the regression, as well as when not controlling for covariates, see Appendix E.",

Similarily, the fatalities per 10,000 inhabitants could have been reduced by 1 to 2 cases about 1.5 months after the start of the epidemic. As for the OLS analysis, the exact numbers should, however, be interpreted with caution, as they are imprecisely estimated and canton-specific factors not considered in the analysis could play a role as well. Figure 10 reports the results for Neuch\u00e2tel, another canton with a relatively late timing, which was on day 10 of the epidemic when the measures came into force. Concerning the effect of the lockdown timing on hospitalizations, we find a similar pattern as for Basel-Stadt. Albeit the effect on COVID-19-related fatalities is somewhat less pronounced, it turns statistically significant in the final periods of the evaluation window. Table 1 shows the average percentage change in distances traveled by MOBIS-COVID19 study participants separately for 10 cantons during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared to a reference period of 4 weeks in autumn 2019, see Molloy et al. (2020) . While mobility was already reduced in times of comparably soft COVID-19 response measures before March 16th, the data point to a further and drastic reduction in mobility after the implementation of lockdown measures. The last column gives the mean difference before and after March 16th in terms of average percentage changes in distances traveled. On average, study participants reduced their mobility after March 16th by 57.17 % when compared to the reference period in 2019 and, as indicated in the table, by 35.09 percentage points more than in the first two weeks of March. A weighted regression of the pooled distance changes on an before-after-indicator for March 16th (with the weights corresponding to the canton-specific sample sizes) yields a heteroscedasticityrobust t-statistic of 10.85 for the before-after difference. The lockdown measures therefore had an immediate effect on mobility patterns that is highly statistically significant. ",

For instance, Koo et al. (2020) provide a simulation study on the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore and model the development of COVID-19 infections under four potential intervention scenarios. Likewise, researchers at the Vienna University of Technology and the university spin-off 'dwh' developed a simulation model to predict the development of infections under different exit strategies out of the lockdown in Austria, see e.g. the media coverage in Laukenmann (2020). Donsimoni et al. (2020) simulate the effect of lockdown timing and duration on the rate of COVID-19 infections and the expected end date of the epidemic in Germany. The study suggests that a complete lift of measures on April 20th would have borne the risk of increasing infection rates. The authors further advise to adopt exit strategies and policies that differ across regions in order to learn about which measures are most effective for containing the epidemic while reducing social and economic costs.",

Furthermore, we construct indicators for whether a canton has introduced certain additional measures not imposed by the federal government along with variables providing the start date of such canton-level measures as stated in press releases of the respective cantons. Additionally, we investigate data on mobility patterns of a representative sample of the Swiss adult population before and after the implementation of the lockdown measures. The data are collected with a GPS tracking app in the MOBIS-COVID19 study, a research project initiated by the ETH Zurich and the University of Basel, seeMolloy et al. (2020).

As a further descriptive statistic, Figure 2 provides the overall deaths per 10,000 inhabitants (thus including COVID-19-related mortality) by calendar week in Germany and Switzerland since January 1st 2020 (provisional data). While the increase in mortality in March and April can be linked to the COVID-19 epidemic (a finding that also holds when controlling for the average mortality over 2015-2019), we cannot directly infer how large the increase would have been with and without the lockdown measures.
