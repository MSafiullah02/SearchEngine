            "text": "1 SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the current pandemic, is spread by droplet transmission 2 and is not thought to be airborne. In indoor environments, there is growing concern over 3 how the virus can circulate within a space. Due to droplet transmission, a 2-metre distance 4 has been implemented in the UK. While droplet transmission in air must be considered, and 5 is a critical component to the safety of healthcare workers interacting with patients, it is also 6 important to consider the role of surfaces. 7 The current guidance states that surface cleaning should be undertaken a minimum 8 of 20 minutes following an Aerosol Generating Procedure (AGP) on a SARS-CoV-2 positive 9 patient (PHE 2020), however there is little guidance on general surface cleaning in other 10 contexts. SARS-CoV-2 remains viable on plastic and steel surfaces up to 72 hours, and 11 copper and cardboard no more than 8 (van Doremalen, Bushmaker et al. 2020). Without 12 effective surface cleaning, this can represent an important risk for surface-mediated 13 transmission. Now more than ever, moment 5 of the 5 moments for hand hygiene, hand 14 hygiene after contact with surrounding surfaces, must be followed (WHO 2009 ). This is vital 15 in clinical areas, but for non-clinical environments also, due to asymptomatic carriage in 16 adults. The results showed that, within 24 hours, the surrogate had moved from the 32 isolation room and transferred to 41% of all surfaces sampled within the ward, with a peak 33 at 52 % on Day 3. The surrogate DNA persisted throughout the sampling period. ",

While this study makes no comparisons between positive site and copy numbers 59 required for infectious dose, the speedy and consistent spread of the surrogate DNA has 60 important implications for infection control. As a high risk area, the isolation room where 61 the bedrail was inoculated had a different cleaning regimen to the rest of the ward, 62 however its wide dissemination indicates cleaning failure. As the surrogate is removed 63 readily with good hand hygiene, this also indicated hand hygiene failure. 64 It is important to consider all methods of tranmission, including the risk from 65 surfaces. To reduce the risk, the first line of defence for preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-66 2, and other potential pathogens, is effective cleaning.
