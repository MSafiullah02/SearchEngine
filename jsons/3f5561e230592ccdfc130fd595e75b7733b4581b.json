A lumbar puncture did not reveal pleocytosis, indicating that COVID-19 likely did not cause a viral meningitis, although CSF PCR for COVID-19 was not done as it is not currently available in the United States. As this was the first atypical presentation of COVID-19 witnessed by the hospital J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f staff, one of the main difficulties encountered was managing the patient's agitation while maintaining proper isolation precautions required for further imaging. This caused diagnostic delays and limited an expedient workup. Ultimately, MRI brain with and without contrast and EEG studies were obtained after the patient was intubated. Results were unremarkable, but could have been altered by the fact that the patient was sedated at the time of EEG, although benzodiazepines were not among the agents used for his sedation.",

One of the biggest challenges was the ability to secure a safe setting for further workup, including imaging and EEG, in an encephalopathic and agitated patient who tested positive for COVID-19. In times when agitation prevents safe transport of patients to imaging/testing, intubation and sedation despite the absence of life-threatening respiratory complications should be considered as an option to achieve safer conditions for necessary diagnostic imaging and testing.",
