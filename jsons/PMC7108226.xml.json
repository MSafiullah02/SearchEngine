Some of above characteristics make SMBR have a potential ability to remove virus more effectively and safely. In last decades, several researches on viral removal by MBR had been carried out and gained some achievements, at the same time, present a few deficiencies. Chiemchaisri et al. [10] put forth that gel layer formed on the membrane surface could reject 4\u20136 log coliphage Q\u03b2 but did not gain the complete phage removal. Then Urase et al. [11] demonstrated that the cake/gel layer of membrane surface made a major contribution to reject virus in activated sludge by batch experiments. However, there was still 3\u20134 log of phages remained in effluent. Afterwards, Kawamura et al. [12] fulfilled the complete removal of phage Q\u03b2 and T1 by using ultramembrane unit but little phage removal mechanism was considered. Otaki et al. [13] also employed microfiltration and ultrafiltration process to the virus removal of the water supply. Recently, Wen et al. [8] investigated the performance of a SMBR for treatment of hospital wastewater but no considerations was given to rival removal. To date, however, more detailed and systematic reports on viral removal efficiency and mechanism of SMBR are still scarce [14].",

Two membrane modules with different pore sizes (0.22 \u03bcm and 0.1 \u03bcm), one larger and the other smaller than T4 size, were used in this study to discuss the relationship between the membrane pore size and virus removal performance. For 0.22 \u03bcm membrane module, 2 log concentration of T4 was detected in the effluent at the beginning (see Fig. 3B, Stage a). The results indicated that the cake/gel layer formed on the 0.22 \u03bcm membrane surface was not adequate to remove all unexpected phages surged into feed wastewater. But, as time past, this value decreased gradually and stabilized at 0.2\u20130.3 log till day 50. It was inferred that cake layer formed on the membrane surface further reduced the effective pore size. The SEM images of the membrane surface show the significant difference between a new membrane and a long-term used one (Fig. 4A and B). It is clear that the used membrane was covered with bacteria and biopolymers, making it difficult for the phages to pass through.",

During this period, no sludge was discharged and C\nb remained at almost a constant value (6.3 log). It was clear that there was no accumulation of phage in bulk solution under the experimental conditions in spite of continuous injection of T4 into the reactor. According to statistic calculation, about 11.0 log phages were fed into the system during this period without excess sludge discharge, which would at least allow C\nb value to reach 9.9 log. So it can be speculated that about 3.6 log of phages were possibly removed inside SMBR compartment everyday. Two main factors, inactivation by activated sludge (r\nAS) and adsorption by cake/gel layer might account for it. Inactivation by extra cellular enzyme, phagocytosis by bacteria and protozoans, and lysis in activated sludge might lead to loss of phages in bulk solution. During the aeration, phages collided with the cake/gel layer and some were adsorbed by it. However, the contribution of each mechanism to phage removal is required further study.",

Five days later, chemical cleansing was carried out for the removal of the gel layer on the membrane surface (Fig. 3, Stage d).As shown in Fig. 3B and C, when the cake layer was present, almost all phages (about 6.3 log) in bulk solution were intercepted by both membrane modules. When the cake layer was removed but the gel one were present, the phage removal efficiency of the 0.22 \u03bcm and 0.1 \u03bcm membranes were 3.1 log (r\nc 0.22) and 5.8 log (r\nc 0.1), respectively under an influent phage concentration of 5.8 log. When the gel layer was removed by chemical cleansing, the phage removal rates for the two modules were 1.7 log (r\nm 0.22) and 5.8 log (r\nm 0.1) for corresponding membrane modules. It can be concluded that the cake layer and gel layer play a significant role on the phage removal for the 0.22 \u03bcm membrane module. If cake/gel layer was decomposed by any factors, 2.7\u20134.1 log of phage would permeate to effluent. For the 0.1 \u03bcm module, on the other hand, membrane alone could block most phages from leaking by direct membrane interception. 1\u20132 PFU ml\u22121 of phage leakage is likely because that the pore size is not absolutely uniform. Consequently, the formation of cake layer and gel layer on 0.1 \u03bcm membrane would permit a safer disinfection effect.",

Results showed that there was still 3\u20134 log of phages in the effluent which was likely due to the loose cake/gel layer formed on membrane since the experimental period was quite short. Chiemchaisri et al. [10] referred to phage removal during organic stabilization and nitrogen removal in an MBR system, but little information on mechanism was discussed. In this paper, viral removal in an MBR equipped with two different membranes (pore size: 0.22 \u03bcm and 0.1 \u03bcm, respectively), one larger and the other smaller than phage T4 size, was evaluated under different operational stages. Although both of the two membranes demonstrated almost complete removal of phage T4 during stable operation, phage removal mechanisms for the two membranes were quite different. For the 0.1 \u03bcm membrane, direct interception by membrane played a key role for T4 removal. For the 0.22 \u03bcm membrane, on the other hand, the cake/gel layer formed on the membrane played an important role.",
