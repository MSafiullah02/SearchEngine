Severe diarrhoea and pneumonia are among the most common reasons for hospital admission in children in low-income and middle-income countries. Despite large reductions in child mortality between 2000 and 2010 (both all-cause mortality, and that specifically associated with diarrhoea and pneumonia), these diseases remain major causes of avoidable deaths and account for about 30% of all child deaths worldwide.1, 2 Thus, achievement of the fourth Millennium Development Goal and the longer-term target3 of reduction of child mortality to 20 deaths or fewer per 1000 livebirths in all countries by 2035 will necessitate substantial decreases in mortality from the two illnesses.4 In this first paper in the Series, we review the epidemiological profile of childhood diarrhoea and pneumonia and present data jointly to inform the planning of integrated control programmes for both illnesses. We bring together previously reported data to compare and contrast the diseases and present new estimates of severe disease, report updated mortality estimates for 2011 (including the estimated number of deaths, by age), and establish how many severe cases and deaths could have been prevented by vaccination.",

Stunting is an important sequela because it is indicative of long-term nutritional deficit and is associated with decreased cognitive function.43 Repeated episodes of diarrhoea can thus lead to cognitive deficits via stunting, but not independently as some researchers have postulated.44 Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, haemolytic uraemic syndrome, and reactive arthritis are rarely noted and are attributable only to selected pathogens (unpublished).15, 45\n",

The most common sequela was reduction in lung volume. Bronchiectasis was reported after 0\u00b79% (0\u00b77\u20138\u00b77) of cases of severe pneumonia. The risk of major sequelae was higher in children younger than 2 years (13\u00b74% [4\u00b75\u201322\u00b73]) than in those aged 2\u20134 years. These findings are consistent with large population-based studies of children in the early 1990s,46, 47, 48 which showed a 6\u20137% increased risk of reduced lung capacity after childhood pneumonia. These studies suggested that risk was highest in the first year of life, presumably because of damage to lung parenchyma and bronchioles in an early stage of lung development, which is postulated to impair lung growth and reduce vital capacity and forced expiratory volume.14 The link between childhood pneumonia and obstructive lung disease is not yet clear.14\n",

A full review of the causes of diarrhoea and pneumonia is beyond the scope of this Series paper and will be published elsewhere.50 The most common cause of severe and fatal diarrhoea worldwide is rotavirus (associated with 28% of severe cases and 28% of fatal cases); the data analysed here are from before the rotavirus vaccine was available, and thus this proportion might be slightly lower in 2011 in the Americas and a few other countries where the vaccine is used (unpublished). V cholerae causes roughly 1% of severe diarrhoea worldwide, but is endemic in south Asia and some countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The global estimate of cases of severe diarrhoea associated with V cholerae, which is based on available data from a global model, differs slightly from that based on regional estimates derived from a subset of regional data (table 2). Because regional estimates are less certain (and thus have wider CIs) than are estimates produced from a global model, we use the global figure for the pathogen-specific global burden of severe diarrhoea and mortality. The outbreak of cholera that began in October, 2010, in Haiti is not included in these estimates, which are for endemic disease only.51\n",

In pathogen-endemic areas, infants receive passive protection from transplacental and breastmilk antibodies for the first 6 months of life. Additionally, exclusively breastfed infants are exposed less to many pathogens than are infants who are not breastfed or receive mixed feedings. After passive immunity wanes, the child's first exposure to a pathogen often results in severe disease; subsequent illnesses tend to be milder and less likely to result in severe dehydration, admission to hospital, and death. For example, symptomatic rotavirus disease is less common in the first than in the second 6 months of life.55 The highest rates of severe disease occur at age 6\u201324 months. Rates of illness then fall as children age because the first infection induces at least partial active immunity, which protects against subsequent illnesses. In view of the high number of enteric pathogens, children won't be immune to all after first infection, so exposures to new organisms or pathogen strains induce illness in older children.The causes of life-threatening invasive bacterial infections in the neonatal period, when clinical syndromes of pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis are practically indistinguishable, are uncertain. Most data from developing countries are reported from unrepresentative hospital-based studies, which have little relevance in home-birth settings (where most children are born in many countries).56, 57, 58, 59 Some data from community-based studies in developing countries suggest that Gram-negative rods are the major cause in early neonates (0\u20136 days), in whom such rods might cause as many as three of every four infections. Klebsiella spp and Staphylococcus aureus, but also Escherichia coli and group B streptococci are thought to be the leading causes in the early neonatal period, when most deaths occur. In the late neonatal and postneonatal periods, Gram-positive cocci (primarily Streptococcus spp) cause about two of every three infections. In the early neonatal period, any of these infections might be environmentally acquired because of unhygienic delivery practices in low-income settings rather than perinatally acquired, which might explain the predominance of Gram-negative infections in home-born infants.56, 57, 58, 59 However, even hospital-born babies in developing countries have a three times greater to 20 times greater risk of neonatal infections because of poor infection-control practices.56, 57, 58, 59\nKlebsiella pneumoniae, other Gram-negative rods (E coli, Pseudomonas spp, Acinetobacter spp), and S aureus are the major pathogens isolated from the bloodstream in hospital settings in the neonatal period, and about 70% of these blood isolates might be untreatable in low-income settings.56, 57, 58, 59 As children grow older, the causes of clinical pneumonia are mainly respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae.Chronic diarrhoea is part of the clinical syndrome of AIDS; it occurs in roughly 50% of children younger than 5 years who have AIDS in high-income countries and nearly all of those in low-income and middle-income countries. Individuals who are infected with HIV and not yet immunodeficient are susceptible to the same microbial causes of diarrhoea as are HIV-negative individuals. Additionally, as the immune system fails, generally when patients have fewer than 200 CD4 cells per \u03bcL, such individuals are also susceptible to many opportunistic pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the Mycobacterium avium complex, cryptosporidium, microsporidia, and cytomegalovirus. HIV can directly affect the intestinal mucosa, resulting in enteropathy with diarrhoea due to changed intestinal functions.60 Infection with Clostridium difficile is common in patients exposed to antimicrobials and hospital settings.Children infected with HIV have a greatly increased risk of pneumonia, particularly bacterial pneumonia (S pneumoniae and H influenzae).61 In addition to the causes of pneumonia listed in table 2\n, Pneumocystis jirovecii, M tuberculosis, cytomegalovirus, and Gram-negative infections are important causes of severe pneumonia in HIV-positive children in the postneonatal period. Of these pathogens, P jirovecii and cytomegalovirus pneumonia occur mainly in infants aged 2\u20136 months. Infections with more than one pathogen or antibiotic-resistant bacteria are more common in HIV-positive than in HIV-negative children, and lead to higher case-fatality ratios.62, 63 In areas where tuberculosis is endemic, M tuberculosis is an important cause of pneumonia in HIV-positive children and can present as acute severe pneumonia. Chronic lung disease is common (although no accurate estimates are available) in HIV-positive children and is due to bacterial pneumonias responding poorly to treatment, tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, lymphoid interstitial pneumonia, or opportunistic fungal infections.61, 63, 64 Little information is available about the effect of HIV infection on neonatal pneumonia. As antiretroviral therapy and co-trimoxazole prophylaxis become more widely used and lead to improved survival of HIV-positive children, severe pneumonia and chronic lung disease can be expected to become more common in older children.",

            "text": "Severe morbidity and mortality and yearly changes in mortality with time are strongly correlated for childhood diarrhoea and pneumonia. Most of the deaths from both illnesses occur in children younger than 2 years. Both diseases are associated with poverty, and child mortality from them is higher in low-income than in high-income countries and in populations in crisis situations (panel 2\n). Diarrhoea and pneumonia share many risk factors, and reduction of risk factors, immunisation, and case management comprise the main approaches to disease control. Thus, we assess their epidemiology in parallel and consider the implications for planning of joint programmes.Panel 2Situations necessitating urgent policy responses related to diarrhoea and pneumonia in children younger than 5 years\nRefugees and emergencies\nIn 2011, an estimated 15\u00b73 million people were displaced by complex humanitarian emergencies. Diarrhoea and pneumonia are important causes of child morbidity and mortality in emergency or refugee settings. Data from health information systems81 in these populations show that pneumonia (defined by WHO thresholds for fast breathing) accounted for 20% of all child deaths and 17% of illness episodes, whereas diarrhoea accounted for 7% of deaths and 10% of illness episodes. Child mortality can be particularly high during the initial emergency phase of a complex humanitarian emergency, and pneumonia and diarrhoea are major avoidable causes of these deaths.82 Mean incidences of pneumonia and diarrhoea in children younger than 5 years were substantially higher than those noted in these countries in non-emergency settings.83 High disease risk is associated with malnutrition, crowding, and poor access to clean water and sanitation.\nPandemic influenza\nSeasonal influenza is the second most common respiratory pathogen identified in children with pneumonia and contributes substantially to hospital admission and mortality worldwide in children younger than 5 years. The first influenza pandemic of the 21st century was officially announced in April, 2009. Infection with the influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 strain resulted in much higher rates of hospital admission in young children than are reported during a normal influenza season.84, 85 Children younger than 5 years can be a high-risk group for pneumonia after an influenza infection\u2014either due to primary viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia (mainly associated with pneumococci).86, 87\nThe 2009 influenza pandemic showed the need for improved surveillance systems to detect changes in influenza activity and underscored the importance of pneumonia control programmes (including immunisation with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and provision of oxygen therapy in more hospital paediatric wards in low-income and middle-income countries) in pandemic influenza preparedness because pneumonia is a major cause of death from pandemic influenza in young children.\nCholera\nCholera is one of the most devastating diarrhoeal diseases, and causes high rates of mortality and widespread social upheaval during epidemics.88 It is caused by infection of the small intestine with the Gram-negative Vibrio cholerae.89 Infection typically causes acute secretory diarrhoea with so-called rice-water stools (as much as 1 L/h), and can result in hypotensive shock and high case-fatality rates in susceptible individuals.90 In endemic areas, incidence peaks in children younger than 5 years because at least partial immunity develops after illness.88, 91 In epidemics when V cholerae infects a naive population, morbidity and mortality occur at all ages.92 Epidemics occur in areas with poor water and sanitation facilities, little basic infrastructure, and high population densities.93\nV cholerae O1 and O139 still cause epidemics and outbreaks have been reported in Zimbabwe, Pakistan, and Haiti since 2005. Oral cholera vaccines are effective in endemic regions where epidemics are common but are not yet widely used in emergency settings. As more data showing the benefits of vaccination are generated, the absence of widespread use, especially in settings where prevention and control are challenging, is becoming questionable.94\n",
