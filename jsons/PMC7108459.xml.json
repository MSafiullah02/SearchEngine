The reverse transcriptase synthesizes an RNA\u2013DNA hybrid, the RNase H digests the RNA component and the reverse transcriptase synthesizes double stranded DNA; finally the T7 RNA polymerase produces numerous RNA copies.

The constant temperature maintained throughout the amplification reaction allows each step of the reaction to proceed as soon as an amplification intermediate becomes available. In addition, RNA is the genomic material of numerous respiratory viruses. The application of an RNA-based amplification technique offers potential advantages compared to a DNA-based amplification technique: no additional reverse transcriptase step is required, thus saving time and reducing the risk of contamination. The specificity of the reactions might, however, be lower because the enzymes used are not thermostable, so that the reaction temperature may not exceed 42 \u00b0C without compromising the reaction. However, the specificity rate is increased by additional hybridization with target-specific probes.",

All RSV procedures have a sensitivity of 94.5\u201397% compared with cell culture and immunofluorescence, but PCR is definitely more sensitive for adults and older persons as a result of the lower virus production in these patients (Landry et al., 2000). Multiple protocols are more frequent for those virusgroups that contain multiple virustypes. Several amplification protocols were developed to cover particular types or groups among the adenoviruses. More than 100 rhinovirus types and their close relationship with enteroviruses constitute a special challenge. The judicious choice of primers and particularly of the hybridization probes should ensure a satisfactory coverage of the rhinovirus types as illustrated by Loens et al.

There are indications that increasing the number of targets in one reaction results in loss of sensitivity (Tong et al., 1999, Vernet, 2004). Tong observed a lower sensitivity of about 1 log for both M. pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae compared with their individual PCRs. On the respiratory samples, the sensitivity of the multiplex assay for M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae and Chlamydia psittaci were 82% (9/11), 100% (11/11) and 86% (6/7), respectively. Vernet observed that the analytical sensitivity of multiplex RT-PCR detection of six viruses, i.e. influenza A, influenza B, RSV A/B, parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3 is reduced by a factor of 1\u20132 logs compared to single detections, depending on the virus. Nevertheless, this multiplex assay was able to identify correctly 95% (21/22) infections in respiratory specimens. This decrease in sensitivity is not unexpected since the presence of several pairs of primers may increase the probability of mispairing resulting in non-specific amplification products and the formation of primer-dimers. Furthermore enzymes, primers and salt concentrations as well as temperature cyclings required for each target may be slightly different. One assay, the commercially available Pneumoplex (Prodesse, Milwaukee, USA) targeting seven respiratory viruses was included in a quality control exercise. Although the limit of detection of this assay was reported to be 5 cfu/ml for M. pneumoniae and 0.01 TCID50/ml for C. pneumoniae and 10 copies of recombinant DNA for each organism (Khanna et al., 2005) the test did not perform well in this evaluation (Loens et al., 2006c). The manufacturer was contacted and is aware of the sensitivity problems of the Pneumoplex assay. They intended to improve the sensitivity of the assay. These commercially available multiplex tests such as the Hexaplex test are still technically demanding, requiring 3\u20134 h hands-on-time (Hindiyeh et al., 2001).",

The superiority of NPA for the detection of all viruses was clearly illustrated in the study by Gruteke et al. (2004); the percentage of diagnosed episodes was 84% on NPA compared with 58% when only swabs were available. Nasal swabs were not suited for the detection of RSV in the study by Heikkinen et al.

The Copan flocked swabs and universal transport medium collection and transport system is a universal system compatible with antigen kit, DFA, culture and PCR (Castriciano et al., 2005, Castriciano et al., 2007, Daley et al., 2006). Nasal swabbing with the new-flocked swabs is equivalent to traditional rayon nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) with less patient discomfort. Significantly more epithelial cells are collected by these flocked swabs providing better specimens for diagnosis. Furthermore, NPS collected with flocked swabs detect a higher number of positives than NPS collected with dacron swabs.",

Internal controls should be added to the samples before NA extraction to monitor the efficiency of the extraction, and to detect inhibitors and possible laboratory contamination. A negative result may point to the absence of the target organism in the sample or to its presence in low copy numbers or to the presence of amplification inhibitors or to poor quality specimens. Different types of internal controls (IC) are available (Loens et al., 2003b). A homologous extrinsic control is an amplicon modified by a non-target-derived sequence insert. It is added to each sample prior to NA extraction and is co-amplified with the same primers used for the target (Ursi et al., 1992, Ursi et al., 2003). This allows to monitor with precision the combined effect of extraction and amplification. The quantity of IC added should be low to prevent competition with the real target. Homologous extrinsic controls have to be constructed for each amplification target separately. Heterologous extrinsic controls are DNA or RNA derived from viruses that cannot infect humans such as seal herpes virus and phocine distemper virus as proposed by Niesters, 2002, Niesters, 2004. They are non-competitive, can be added to any amplification reaction but require the addition of specific primers. Dingle et al. (2004) proposed a modified hepatitis deltavirus for this purpose. Finally a heterologous intrinsic control certifies the presence of human NA and thus possible virus containing cellular material in the sample. Examples are the beta-globin, the gamma interferon, the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and the U1A genes (Loens et al., 2003b). They are particularly important for throat swab specimens that may have inadequately scraped the mucosal surface and for sputum specimens that may contain too few leucocytes. Apfalter et al. (2005) discussed all steps in NAAT procedures that need proper attention, from the pre-analytical procedures over the assay design, interpretation of the results and quality control.",

Validation must be performed at several levels, including sample preparation, amplification and detection as was concluded in a standardization workshop on C. pneumoniae assays (Dowell et al., 2001).

As illustrated by a number of studies, there is a need for standardized material, particularly for quantitative tests, and participation in external quality control programs. Commercialized kits are hardly available for respiratory agents, with the exception of a sars-coronavirus RT-PCR (Bio-M\u00e9rieux). This situation may evolve rapidly: a research-use-only kit was already available for C. pneumoniae (Chernesky et al., 2002) as well as standardized reagent kits and internal controls (IPL Aplied Biosystems) with some commercialized multiplex tests, both conventional such as Pneumoplex and Hexaplex (Prodesse), the ID-Tag respiratory viral panel from Tm Bioscience Corp. (Toronto, Canada) as real time formats such as Chlamylege (Argene) (Ginevra et al., 2005). The greatest problems to overcome with molecular methods is false positivity caused by contamination, although automatic sample preparation and real time NAATs represent a significant progress in this matter. The false negativity is associated with the great differences in sensitivity of home made assays (Apfalter et al., 2005; Loens et al., 2006c, Templeton et al., 2006, Van Vliet et al., 2001). The task of QC is being taken up by internationally collaborating laboratories such as QCMD (Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostics) endorsed by the European Society for Clinical Virology (ESCV) and the European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.",

Several studies illustrate a lack of standardization of antigens of M. pneumoniae (Beersma et al., 2005, Talkington et al., 2004) In one study 6/12 and 9/12 of PCR-documented M. pneumoniae infections were diagnosed in acute and convalescent phase sera, respectively (Talkington et al., 2004). In another study anti M. pneumoniae IgM antibodies were detected in 7\u201325% (depending on the test applied) of acute sera and IgG antibodies in 41\u201363% of convalescent sera depending on the timing of the second sample (Beersma et al., 2005).

Moreover, virology laboratories at present do not operate 24/24 h, 7/7 days but the situation may change as more molecular tests may be required as an emergency, also outside the field of infectious diseases. The clinical laboratory should therefore also integrate among its activities the NAATs applied in fields other than respiratory infections such as arboviruses and emergency testing for meningo-encephalitits and intra-partum detection of Streptococcus agalactiae. Such testing might be performed in a permanently functioning and greatly automated laboratory section that might then include the molecular diagnosis of the most prevalent viruses of the moment and those respiratory infections susceptible to antibiotics.",

At the technical side improved standardization, more automation and more widespread use will result in cost reduction to rates competitive with conventional methods. In addition, to assess the overall benefit of amplification techniques, not only the direct costs of PCR reagents and equipment should be taken into consideration but also the indirect cost savings such as decreased antibiotic use or decreased hospital stay.
