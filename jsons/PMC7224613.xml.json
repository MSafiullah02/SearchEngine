            "text": "Unique to our institution at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, we are at the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore, being connected to the National Centre of Infectious Diseases (NCID), a specialist facility for the management of infectious diseases. The NCID comprises isolation and intensive-care wards, operating theaters, radiology and laboratory facilities, as well as a screening center, which currently handles about 70% of the COVID-19 screening load in Singapore. Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in January, orthopaedic residents and attending surgeons have been deployed to the NCID screening center to assist in assessing suspected COVID-19 cases, under the purview of our emergency medicine and infectious diseases colleagues. As a spine service, we were no exception, with up to 25% of our orthopaedic department manpower being deployed to the NCID screening center at any point in time. Consequently, we had to frequently rotate from our regular \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d responsibilities to our front-line duties at the NCID screening center, with no \u201ccooling off\u201d period in between. In order to do this safely, we needed to adhere strictly to, and more importantly, trust the personal protective equipment (PPE) protocols set by our institution to avoid cross-contamination and nosocomial infections of our patients and colleagues. At the start, the fact that we were working in an unfamiliar environment, out of the realms of the operating room and fraught with new threats, did provoke some anxiety and uncertainty; however, the strict PPE guidelines set by our institution and by the Ministry of Health, together with the widespread availability and, indeed, enforcement of PPE for health-care workers, gave us reassurance that we were well protected in this task of serving at the front lines. Additionally, clear clinical protocols and leadership at the NCID screening center by our emergency medicine colleagues helped to reduce the burden of clinical decision-making, as each suspected case could be assessed and managed accordingly on the basis of clinical or epidemiological criteria. Although it may be novel for orthopaedic spine surgeons to be involved in the evaluation of COVID-19 suspect cases, we believe these are exceptional circumstances during which we can rise to the challenge and serve at the front lines, supporting our colleagues during times of need.",

            "text": "The response of Singapore to COVID-19 has been a graduated one, with our containment measures taken in proportion to community spread. At the start of the outbreak, when community spread was limited, we instituted selected safe-distancing measures while maintaining relative normalcy in day-to-day life. As of April 7, 2020, as the number of locally transmitted cases has increased, Singapore instituted a series of heightened measures, referred to collectively as a \u201ccircuit breaker,\u201d in order to halt community spread6. Further safe-distancing measures were implemented, such as closures of schools and physical workplaces. This graduated, stepwise approach has avoided the need for an abrupt \u201clockdown\u201d of work and public life. Similarly, in our spine service, we have taken the same stepwise approach in changing our practice according to the severity of the outbreak in order to conserve resources and ensure the safety of health-care workers.",

We cancelled all spinal-deformity or revision cases and prioritized minimally invasive and endoscopic cases, which generally required a shorter length of stay and had lower surgical blood loss. Postoperatively, we actively expedited all discharge or transfer to rehabilitation facilities in order to free up hospital beds. In the outpatient setting, all non-urgent spine appointments, such as referrals for osteoporotic compression fractures, or acute back pain without neurology, were rescheduled to later dates. We offered patients with intractable radicular symptoms the option of nerve-root injections as they could be done under local anesthesia as surgical day cases; however, as a tertiary hospital and major trauma center, we continued to receive and operate on emergency spinal trauma or tumor cases. Because we had cut down on elective work as an institution, we were able to emergently operate on these cases as clinically indicated, with adequate anesthesia, nursing, and perioperative support, which highlights the need for resource conservation during times of crisis so that patients who urgently need care can continue to receive that care to the highest standard.",

As a result, we have cut our regular operating and outpatient caseload, otherwise termed as \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d duties, from 50% to 30% of the norm and now limit our caseload to time-sensitive cases that require a surgical procedure to prevent neurological deterioration. Although our elective arthroplasty and sports surgery patients may be rescheduled to 6 months later or beyond, spine surgery is unique relative to other elective orthopaedic work in that there are emergency as well as urgent cases, which are also classified as \u201cessential services\u201d based on Ministry of Health criteria. Apart from spinal trauma, tumor, and other spinal emergencies, there are certain instances in which a prolonged delay in surgical treatment may lead to an irreversible deterioration of function, which can negatively impact both the work status and quality of life of the patient. In the setting of cervical myelopathy or new-onset neurological deficits from lumbar spinal stenosis, a 6-month postponement of surgical treatment could result in poorer neurological recovery and functional outcomes. Our underlying principle in reducing and prioritizing but not completely cancelling all surgical cases is to maintain sustainability in the long run as we try to balance our continued efforts against COVID-19 with our duty of care to our spine patients.",

Young patients may display mild symptoms\u2014and as such, may be infected but undiagnosed\u2014and present with spinal trauma requiring an emergency surgical procedure. In our institution, we have formulated a protocol for patients with suspected COVID-19 who require a surgical procedure, based on the risk assessment regarding COVID-19 and the urgency of surgical treatment. This protocol works in tandem with specialized engineering features in our operating rooms and staff PPE measures to ensure the safety of health-care workers. Patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 and those with pneumonia and unknown COVID-19 status will be operated on in a designated operating room to avoid contamination of the main operating room and of other patients. This purpose-built operating room is equipped with a negative-pressure system as well as high-efficiency particulate filters. All health-care workers should be equipped with a cap, gown, N95 respirator mask, and goggles, and anesthetists may choose to use powered air-purifying respirators for aerosol-generating procedures such as airway intubation. Surgical procedures should be performed expediently, and only selected equipment should be brought into the operating room in order to reduce the number of items that require cleaning after the procedure. The presence of health-care personnel should be kept to a minimum to minimize exposure. Electrocautery, which has been shown to generate aerosols, should be kept to a minimum, with liberal use of suction to remove smoke and aerosols7.",
