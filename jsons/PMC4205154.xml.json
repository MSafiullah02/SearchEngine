For contagious diseases this will require coupling the risk of premature release from quarantine to a disease transmission model such as Legrand et al. 8. This can schematically be shown as in Figure 1. If the costs for enforcing quarantine up to a given time (post exposure) and if the costs associated with releasing individuals at a given time post exposure (with concomitant probability of eventually becoming contagious) can both be estimated, then the optimal quarantine time should be at the intersection of the curves given that both are plotted using the same y-axis. Clearly for pathogens that have a high degree of transmissibility and/or a high degree of severity, the quarantine time should be greater than for agents with lower transmissibility and/or severity. The purpose of this paper is not to estimate where the balancing point should be.",

Further, outbreaks such as the current West Africa EBOV are presenting an opportunity for careful collection of data sufficient to revise and update (perhaps in an adaptive fashion) such recommendations. It may be that incubation time itself is a function of intensity and nature of contact21, which may also need to be considered. The estimate of appropriate incubation time would need to explicitly consider the costs and benefits involved in various alternatives, which would incorporate explicit computations from transmission modeling.",
