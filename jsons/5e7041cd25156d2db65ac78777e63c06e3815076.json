Although some studies have been performed to study the applications of EA in public sectors, governments, and cities, most of such studies are scattered and there is no strong research stream. As a result, it is difficult to effectively accumulate relevant knowledge and experiences. In this research, we attempt to explore research streams and trends by analyzing why existing studies were conducted, what outcomes were produced, and what methods were used in these studies. Starting from these three questions, a thematic framework was developed, and a literature synthesis was presented. The result shows the complexity of this area, the importance of balancing technical factors and non-technical factors, the challenges brought by nonfunctional requirements. Despite the importance of EA frameworks, few studies have been found in which government or city relevant requirements were addressed in a general way. Such findings are expected to provide useful insights for possible future research in this area.",

By leveraging the power of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in public sectors or governments and making a city \"smart\", e-governments and smart cities are emerging as a strategy to mitigate problems generated by the urban population growth and rapid urbanization, improve the efficiency of urban management and bring better life to residents. However, as a giant system which involves various kinds of stakeholders, new technologies and complicated ICT subsystems, challenges such as complexity, interoperability and alignment between business goals and ICT implementations have been met [3, 4] .",

As a result, general knowledge regarding EA in e-governments is difficult to be accumulated and be reused elsewhere. And in return, practices cannot be improved efficiently accordingly. To address this problem, we propose to characterize existing studies in this field by answering three important questions: why one research on applying EA in e-government or smart cities was required (motivation), what kind of outcome was contributed (contribution), and how the research was performed (method). These three questions have been thought fundamental and used widely to get an overview of studies in specific fields [7] [8] [9] . Starting on this characterization theme, we developed a framework and performed initial explorations by analyzing and grouping a set of studies in this area based on the framework. The result was presented as a literature synthesis. Findings from this synthesis are expected to bring some insights for possible future research directions.",

To address this, widely used three questions, namely Why, What, and How were employed in this study. These three questions have been used in various domains such as [8, 10, 11] to help organize and analyze existing studies. Starting from them, we extracted four or five answers to each question through a simplified research synthesis [12] based on a sample of ten highly relevant studies. Because we have read these papers previously, we are familiar with the depth and breadth of the evidences in these studies. Further, with the three questions as the structure, we then identify specific segments of text for each question, label, reduce overlap, and translate them into enumerated answers. The three questions together with the enumerated answers constitute a framework for further literature synthesis.",

Although our original interest domain is smart city, papers regarding applying EA in smart cities are rare. We expand the domains to e-government and public sectors as they are highly relevant, and the concepts started to be used interchangeably during recent years [13] . Due to time and resources constraints, we put our focus on more recently published and highly qualified papers by restricting publication years and checking the relevance with this study. We searched papers that have been published between 2009 to 2019. After excluding duplicated papers and papers that were not written in English or full texts are not available, we collected 35 scientific papers.

To address such non-technical issues, institutional aspects of applying EA in governments were investigated [28, 31, 32] . EA did not create administrative or political transformation by itself. Instead, fundamental transformation can only be achieved when the institutional force at the micro and macro level promotes transformation [28] .

Therefore, fundamental transformation to organizational tasks can only be achieved when transformation is promoted by institutional forces. Similarly, it was reported that current EAs were primarily product oriented, with their sociopolitical aspects neglected often [29] , and simply taking an IT perspective on EA as a prerequisite to e-government implementation was a serious mistake [27] . Both technical and nontechnical factors should be considered [30] , and two key institutionalization techniques, inductive communication and deployment of experts to local contexts, might help overcome the struggles of translating new practices [32] . More concrete contributions were produced in some studies such as how EA was understood by public sector authorities [15] , twenty challenges faced by the public sector agencies [17] , sixteen problems and eight root causes in the context of public sectors [18] when developing and implementing EA.

An government EA framework developed based on TOGAF and SONA that have been used in Indonesia was presented [40] . The modified EA of the health management information system at India was studied [22] .

In addition to technical factors, non-technical factors also play important roles when applying EA in e-government development. However, along with the development of new technologies such as big data and cloud computing during recent years, how to apply them in this area has also become a rising hot spot. Another stream of research is about achieving non-functional requirements. Around one third of selected studies have described their efforts to improve specific aspect of the overall performance of egovernments, which involves both technical factors and/ or non-technical factors generally.",
