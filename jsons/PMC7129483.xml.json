Protein misfolding is a complex phenomenon that can be facilitated, impeded, or prevented by interactions with various intracellular metabolites and interprotein interaction with intracellular nanomachines controlling protein folding. A fundamental understanding of molecular processes leading to misfolding and self-aggregation of proteins will provide critical information to help identify appropriate therapeutic routes to control these processes. Protein misfolding is the very fist link in this long chain of events eventually leading to neurodegeneration. Therefore, availability of methods capable of detecting the pathological protein conformations facilitates the development of novel tools for diagnostic and treating the diseases at very early stages of development. Single-molecule force spectroscopy atomic force microscope was proposed to measure the strength of the interprotein interactions before aggregation [3], [4]. The capability of the atomic force microscope to manipulate with the tip in the nanometer scale was used for development of the nanotweezers approach capable of single-molecule selecting of antibodies for a certain type of protein aggregates.",

To investigate the link between complex I impairment and sequence-specific, post-translational modifications of \u03b1-synuclein, the protein was isolated from rotenone-treated PC12 cells and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry [5]. It was found that rotenone induced various modifications in the C-terminal region of \u03b1-synuclein, including oxidation of methionine, nitration and amination of tyrosine, and phosphorylation of tyrosine and serine. These modifications correlated with an increase in the levels of membrane-bound, oligomeric \u03b1-synuclein detectable by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy and lipid flotation. In parallel, it was found that \u03b1-synuclein aggregation and toxicity were suppressed by DJ-1, an antioxidant protein that is dysfunctional in some cases of familial Parkinson disease. A current goal in nanomedicine is to determine how the conformational behavior of \u03b1-synuclein is influenced by sequence-specific modifications using single-molecule approaches.",

These polymers incorporate poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) into their backbone structure and are polymerized with one to several other monomers, such as sebacic acid (SA), that are also known to be safe in humans. The addition of PEG to the polymer backbone allows classical poly(anhydrides) to be formulated into nanoparticles that are readily resuspended in liquids for injection or inhalation, or into dry powder microparticles that are easily aerosolized for inhalation. PEG coats the surface of the particles naturally during particle preparation, allowing the linkage of targeting agents to the free end of PEG (i.e., end not attached to the rest of the polymer). Highly selective targeting of poly(PEG-SA) particles to inflamed blood vessels was demonstrated following the attachment of antibodies against molecules that are upregulated on the luminal side of inflamed endothelial cells in a collaboration with Prof. Doug Goetz from the Ohio University. Poly(PEG-SA) nanoparticles (with transferrin attached to the free end of PEG) were also able to penetrate targeted cancer cells and rapidly transit within the cell to the perinuclear region; these particles were more toxic to cancer cells at relevant doses than the free drug.",

Microbubbles (hollow microspheres with a shell composed of albumin) are currently used clinically as a contrast agent in diagnostic ultrasound. Dr. Price showed that ultrasound can be used at low frequencies to cause bubbles in targeted regions to explode (by cavitation), which causes a significant increase in the local permeability of the endothelium to drugs and even large particles. Highly targeted delivery of polymer nanoparticles to muscle tissue was clearly demonstrated in an animal model. Control over particle penetration depth was achieved by simply applying ultrasound without microbubbles, in which case particles penetrated only the endothelium and not into the interstitium, whereas the application of ultrasound with microbubbles led to particle delivery to both the endothelium and the interstitium. The results suggest that this technique may provide an alternative to molecular targeting for a variety of diseases.",

The nanoparticles are PEGylated to reduce clearance by the reticuloendothelial system; evidence that liver and spleen uptake of the nanoparticles was minimal as compared with uptake by tumors in mice was provided. Aurimune was administered to two dogs with naturally occurring tumors and to rabbits; in each case its administration caused fever but did not cause hypotension. Hypotension has historically been dose limiting in the treatment of cancer with TNF-\u03b1.

He also pointed out that most of the polymers being studied for drug delivery are made by random copolymerization techniques, which limits control over monomer sequence, polymer molecular weight, and molecular weight distribution that may affect the performance of a given nanomedicine platform technology. Dr. Ghandehari then described several means by which polymers and nanosystems could be made with better definition of structure and dimensions, including his laboratory\u2019s experience with N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide copolymers, poly(amido amine) dendrimers, recombinant polymeric gene carriers, and silica nanotubes, and discussed the relationship of carrier structure at the nanoscale and function in targeted drug delivery.",

The final surface properties of nanoparticles dictate everything, from whether they will aggregate in vivo to how effectively they will circulate and find their target.
