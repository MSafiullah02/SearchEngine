In 2014, more than 137.8 million patient visits were made to US EDs, at a rate of 432 per 1000 population.1 More than half of the 34.5 million inpatient admissions that occur annually in the United States originate in an ED. During mass casualty events, natural disasters, and public health emergencies, EDs play an integral part in local and regional response, absorbing rapid surges of patients requiring emergent medical attention. On a day-to-day basis, EDs function as a safety net for diverse and often vulnerable populations that might not otherwise receive routine health care. Infectious diseases factor prominently among the reasons patients seek care in the ED. Emergency clinicians must be well versed not only in the diagnosis and management but also in the control and prevention of infectious diseases.",

As a hybrid environment bridging ambulatory and hospital care, the ED presents unique challenges to this work.2, 3 By virtue of a concentrated geographic footprint, ED patients and healthcare professionals (HCP) routinely come in close contact with one another in busy waiting rooms as well as treatment areas. Undifferentiated clinical presentations of infectious disease delay recognition, patient isolation, and HCP use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), increasing the potential for transmission of disease. Variable patient acuity, frequent HCP-patient interactions, and simultaneous care of multiple patients create obstacles to infection prevention practices, particularly when invasive procedures are necessary. Finite inpatient beds and isolation rooms lead to the boarding of patients with infectious illness in the ED. Overcrowding, be it from high patient volume or delays in hospital admission, can lead to the evaluation and treatment of patients in nontraditional environs such as a hallway or other overflow sites. Finally, rapid room turnovers frequently strain environmental cleaning services, allowing the persistence of infectious microorganisms on health care surfaces.",

            "text": "Hand hygiene is a fundamental principle of infection prevention. Health care provider hands have the capacity to transmit pathogens from one patient to another.4, 5, 6 Microorganisms present on patient skin, from either infection or colonization, or shed into the health care environment can contaminate the hands of an HCP through direct patient contact or interaction with their environment (eg, bed rails, bed linen, bedside furniture, or patient care equipment). When these microorganisms are able to persist on skin and hand hygiene is lacking or inadequate, HCP hands can transmit them to another patient through direct contact or interaction with their environment. In the absence of visible soiling, routine hand hygiene using an alcohol-based hand rub is an effective and time-efficient means for reducing the cross-transmission of pathogenic microorganisms in health care settings.4 Hand washing with soap and water is advised when HCP hands are grossly soiled or when caring for patients with suspected Clostridium difficile or norovirus infection, because alcohol-based products lack efficacy and mechanical friction associated with hand washing aids in the removal of these pathogens. Although most emergency clinicians are accustomed to performing hand hygiene upon room entry and exit (ie, \u201cfoam in, foam out\u201d) and before any procedure, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend hand hygiene before and/or after key actions, best codified within the latter\u2019s \u201cMy Five Moments for Hand Hygiene\u201d4, 6 (Fig. 1\n).",

Tuberculosis, measles, and varicella (including disseminated zoster) are classic airborne diseases that pose a risk to emergency clinicians. Several emerging pathogens, including smallpox, highly pathogenic influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), are readily transmitted in this manner as well. Airborne precautions mandate HCP use of an N95 or powered air-purifying respirator during patient care and prompt placement of the infected patient within a single-occupancy airborne infection isolation room (capable of generating negative room pressure and \u226512 air exchanges per hour).31 EDs are decidedly vulnerable and highly likely to be involved in the initial care of a patient infected with an airborne pathogen. Use of screening tools and clinical decision-making instruments can aid recognition of airborne infections based on symptoms, risk factors, and objective clinical findings32, 33, 34 and may in turn help expedite initiation of airborne precautions in the ED. Education and access to appropriately fitting PPE are necessary if adherence to these precautions is to be improved.35 Finally, limited availability of isolation rooms remains a significant barrier for many EDs, particularly when caring for multiple patients requiring airborne precautions.36, 37 The added time required to completely exchange the air in an isolation room after a patient has left imposes further burden on its availability for the next patient.",

Droplet precautions consist of HCP use of a surgical mask whenever working within a 3-foot radius of the infected patient.31 Isolation is implemented either through physical separation (>3 feet) from other patients and use of a privacy curtain, or placement of the infected patient within a single-occupancy room. Access to PPE, particularly during peak respiratory virus season, and diminished awareness of when to use them can hinder adherence to droplet precautions in the ED.38 Education and reminders to HCPs, including through the electronic medical record, can improve adherence.39 Promoting respiratory hygiene through patient education on cough etiquette, hand hygiene, masking and separation of patients with respiratory complaints in the ED waiting room at the time of triage, and optimization of HCP adherence to droplet precautions may also help reduce transmission of respiratory pathogens, but requires significant patient engagement.40, 41\n",

Surfaces with the highest rate of cleaning included the bed mattress (97%) and stretcher rail (72%). Surfaces with the lowest rate of cleaning included the procedure light handle (3%) and wall-mounted thermometer (0%). It is vital that ED, EVS, and infection prevention leaders work together to identify \u201chigh-touch\u201d surfaces in treatment areas and prioritize their regular cleaning.54 Emergency clinicians may perceive the time to correctly clean \u201chigh-touch\u201d and other environmental surfaces as a barrier to providing prompt live-saving patient care. Pressure to turn over a treatment room or space expediently may lead to incomplete environmental surface disinfection. ED staff may be unaware of which cleaning and disinfection products are approved and compatible with medical equipment surfaces in the ED or the contact times necessary for these products to work effectively. Likewise, ED staff may be unfamiliar with which surfaces they are responsible for cleaning (eg, sensitive medical equipment) and which surfaces fall under the purview of EVS (eg, stretcher rails, countertops, door handles) at their facility, leading to confusion and poor compliance. In an ED in Brazil, coordinated efforts to educate nursing about environmental cleaning, standardize cleaning procedures and supplies, and conduct compliance audits with feedback increased compliance, but proved difficult to sustain over time.55 Further studies addressing the dissemination and implementation of environmental cleaning best practices in EDs are greatly needed.",
