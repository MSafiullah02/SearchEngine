In prior case\u2013control studies, virus nucleic acids could be isolated from 20\u201327% of asymptomatic subjects.35, 36 This might be supported by the data showing that among those with mixed infections, the outcomes were not significantly worse than those for subjects with single infections. While all subjects enrolled were symptomatic, and this would increase the likelihood that isolated pathogens were causative, cohort studies such as ours are not able to directly determine causation. With 62 unique combinations in 125 different subjects, the assessment of outcomes lacks statistical power to determine differences between the various combinations of mixed infections.",
