In the minds of most, jaundice or elevated liver function tests equals liver disease, but many questions tend to surface: What is the etiology? Can referral wait until more diagnostic information is available? What are the appropriate tests to do and how urgently? What is the likely progression and are there potentially life-threatening consequences of delayed diagnosis and treatment? None of these questions can be answered without formulating a reliable differential diagnosis.",

The hope is to help primary medical providers determine the differential diagnosis and thus guide early studies and appropriate referral and pediatric gastroenterologists and trainees to determine a comprehensive differential diagnosis for their patients on which to base a rational work-up and management plan. This chapter is not intended to be a plan for the detailed investigation of a child with liver disease or a commentary on the probability of any given diagnosis when encountering a patient that fulfils a particular clinical phenotype, but to list the diagnoses that have been recognized, even if only very rarely. Any schema describing the investigations to work through a differential diagnosis is dependent on local conditions dictated by resource availability, priorities, and the probability of a specific diagnosis. For example, in the northwest of the USA, dengue fever would not be included in most differential diagnoses of a local patient, but in Southeast Asia, this would be a major priority.\n",

Similarly, a careful history of contact with infectious disease, foreign travel, and occupational exposure should be obtained. It is important to examine the urine and stool color if possible or, at a very minimum, have the parents describe these colors; stool color charts have been designed for this purpose (see 10.1007/978-1-4614-9005-0_13).

It is not enough to expect the correct diagnosis to eventually reveal itself if a multitude of laboratory tests and imaging studies are ordered. In the absence of an expert physical examination, a child with ascites of cardiac origin may undergo multiple studies of the liver over many weeks before the correct etiology is recognized. Similarly the patient with pancytopenia, but in whom the modest splenomegaly is not recognized, may be investigated extensively (and expensively) in the hematology department before portal hypertension with hypersplenism is diagnosed.",

The first of these is age at presentation, primarily because many diseases have a typical age (range) of onset. This may allow us to eliminate some diseases completely, for example, primary biliary cirrhosis has never been described in a young child, and to relegate the possibility of yet others, for example, hepatomegaly first encountered in an adolescent is unlikely to be due to glycogen storage disease. Evidence of liver disease present at birth may imply an intrauterine process such as defects of embryonic developmental genes, congenital infections, or isoimmune phenomena, whereas early postnatal disease may indicate an inborn error of metabolism or infection acquired perinatally.",

Similarly the onset of liver disease during pregnancy such as HELLP (hypertension, elevated liver tests, and low platelets) syndrome or acute fatty liver of pregnancy may indicate metabolic disease in the fetus and usually carrier status in the woman. A detailed family history will help reveal potential familial predisposition such as parental consanguinity or a previous sibling with a single-gene defect. Occasionally there is manifestation of a heterozygous status in relatives such as cholelithiasis in the family of the child with MDR3 deficiency. In a patient suspected of having autoimmune hepatitis, a history in the extended family of other autoimmune conditions such as lupus or hypothyroidism is likely to be relevant.",

            "text": "Environmental exposure to infectious or toxic agents is another general consideration that may alter probabilities within a list of differential diagnoses. Infectious etiologies may gain priority due to an endemic risk at place of abode or recent travel to an at-risk area. A history of drinking or bathing in water from a local supply while traveling raises the possibility of a whole range of infectious agents capable of inducing liver injury. International travel is not, however, a prerequisite for unusual infections that may manifest as liver disease; for example, Histoplasma capsulatum, a cause of granulomatous hepatitis especially in the immunocompromised, is endemic in some central and southern US states [3], and baylisascariasis, a rare cause of hepatomegaly and meningoencephalitis, has been described in young children who have ingested soil contaminated with raccoon feces [4]. Knowledge that a mother has a chronic transmissible infection, particularly hepatitis B but also including hepatitis C, HIV, malaria, and Chagas disease [5], may simplify the diagnosis of an infant with liver disease. Exposure to industrial toxins, particularly from pollutant spills, is usually reported, but particularly in the developing world, there may not be a full disclosure; therefore, direct questioning is essential. Also all drug exposures should be assessed including herbal and homeopathic remedies and dietary supplements. Ingestion of wild mushrooms is a particular risk. Amanita species are found in many parts of the world, while other foods collected straight from nature may be either directly toxic or chemically contaminated. Not all effects of environmental exposure occur immediately upon exposure; minocycline-induced autoimmune hepatitis takes a period of 12\u201320 months from initiation of treatment for teenage acne, for instance, before liver dysfunction appears [6].",

            "text": "Pediatric liver disease is not common in the general practitioners\u2019 experience, and therefore, the diagnoses and its diagnostic work-up may be relatively unfamiliar. Additionally, although established liver disease is rare, it is not uncommon to see mild abnormalities of liver function tests. In infants jaundice is frequently seen in the form of physiologic neonatal jaundice and breast milk jaundice. Although these causes manifest as unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, it does mean that the mere presence of jaundice in a newborn infant does not necessarily raise the suspicion of liver disease. The difficulties of diagnosis are doubly increased when dealing with acute liver failure; not only are there severe constraints on the time available for a full diagnostic work-up but hepatic metabolic function is severely deranged, sometimes making the differentiation between primary and secondary metabolic abnormalities virtually impossible by biochemical means. Fortunately there are now much greater nucleic acid-based options for primary diagnosis of specific inborn errors of metabolism, but results can take time to become available. Another concern in the early detection of pediatric liver disease relates to the difficulty of maintaining basic clinical examination skills in an age of advanced imaging techniques. The ability of the physician to use hands and eyes to detect clinical signs such as hepatomegaly, ascites, and cutaneous features of liver disease needs to be carefully nurtured among medical students and junior medical staff. Finally, there are a number of terms that are commonly used in regard to liver disease that mean the diagnosis has not been identified such as \u201cidiopathic\u201d fulminant hepatic failure, \u201ccryptogenic\u201d cirrhosis, and \u201cneonatal hepatitis.\u201d It is important to remember that these are not diagnoses but an admission that the diagnostic work-up has failed to identify the primary cause of liver disease. The acceptance of these terms as seemingly discreet diseases may be in some way responsible for incomplete diagnostic work-up. Narkewicz et al. describe how frequently a suboptimal diagnostic work-up is seen in children presenting with acute liver failure when given a diagnosis of idiopathic liver failure even in the context of a multicenter study [9].",

These findings are not specific for primary congenital liver disease as congenital ascites is commonly due to severe fetal anemia, both isoimmune and nonimmune causes such as alpha thalassemia, or fetal heart failure, and is mostly seen in the setting of generalized hydrops fetalis (see Table 6.2 for a more complete list of causes). When primary liver disease is suspected, an important diagnosis to consider is \u201cneonatal hemochromatosis.\u201d Studies by Whitington and colleagues have demonstrated that the majority of these cases are due to a maternal factor (presumably an IgG alloantibody) crossing the placenta and inducing complement-mediated hepatocellular injury, one result of which is excessive iron deposition [10]. This immune-mediated \u201cneonatal hemochromatosis\u201d condition has been renamed gestational alloimmune liver disease (GALD) (see 10.1007/978-1-4614-9005-0_10).\n",

Generalize septicemia and, in at-risk populations, congenital malaria may also present in this manner.

Certain syndromes such as ARC (arthrogryposis, renal anomalies, and cholestasis), Aagenaes, Donahue, or Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome also have characteristic physical manifestations, and the presence of hepatomegaly or liver function abnormalities simply supports the diagnosis.

The general pediatrician sees more children with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia secondary to prolonged physiologic jaundice or breast milk jaundice than they do children with cholestatic jaundice. Infants with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia have colorless urine and pigmented stools (yellow-green or brown) [12]. It is important to recognize that infants without conjugated hyperbilirubinemia do not pass yellow or amber urine because they drink at least 100 mL/kg/day and therefore pass dilute urine, unlike adults who frequently pass more concentrated yellow urine. Unconjugated jaundice still needs to be investigated if it is either very early in onset, prolonged beyond 10\u201314 days, very high levels, or of late onset. If breast milk jaundice is suspected and there is no evidence of hemolysis or infection, thyroid function is normal, and bilirubin levels are not progressively increasing, breast-feeding does not need to be discontinued. However, if the bilirubin level continues to rise, defects of bilirubin conjugation (Crigler-Najjar syndrome) should be considered. The high frequency of unconjugated jaundice in the infant population is one factor that has been suggested for late referrals of infants with biliary atresia; the rare case of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is like a proverbial needle in the haystack of infants with unconjugated jaundice! It is important for the general pediatrician to remain alert to the possibility that an infant\u2019s jaundice is cholestatic and request split bilirubin levels \u2013 total and direct or better still conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin levels (see 10.1007/978-1-4614-9005-0_3).",

The inclusion of \u03b3-glutamyl transferase and creatine kinase (or other muscle-derived enzyme such as aldolase) can help differentiate the tissue source of elevated levels of AST and ALT. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a particularly important diagnosis to consider. Another cause of elevated transaminase levels in the absence of liver disease is due to macroenzymes (especially macro-AST) [13]. Serum enzymes may complex with immunoglobulins resulting in a high molecular weight complex that has a prolonged half-life because of reduced plasma clearance. Although macroenzymes have been associated with acute, chronic, and malignant liver disease, most cases appear benign and self-limiting although the triggers for formation are not fully understood. Benign (or transient) hyperphosphatasia is frequently seen in young children possibly provoked by a mild intercurrent illness [14]. The alkaline phosphatase level can peak in the thousands and remains elevated for a few weeks to a few months before settling to the normal range. If the isoenzymes of alkaline phosphatase are assayed, the largest increase is seen in bone-derived isoenzyme although liver isoenzyme can be increased as well.

Autoimmune hepatitis often presents with acute hepatitis and although more frequent in adolescent girls can occur in both sexes and at any age (see 10.1007/978-1-4614-9005-0_16). Most cases of Wilson disease diagnosed in childhood and adolescence manifest as acute, often fulminant, hepatitis, and although rare, an expedient diagnosis may prevent death or liver transplantation (see 10.1007/978-1-4614-9005-0_9).\n",

More commonly isolated splenomegaly is identified, and if portal hypertension is not considered, the child or teenager may go through detailed hematological investigations unnecessarily. Extrahepatic portal hypertension, due to portal vein thrombosis having occurred usually years before frequently in infancy related to umbilical sepsis or catheterization, can present with splenomegaly. Alternatively, the detection of portal hypertension may be the first sign of chronic liver injury, for example, in autoimmune hepatitis or chronic viral hepatitis, resulting in cirrhosis, but with no history of previous ill health in the child (see Table 6.11). In these circumstances the liver is usually shrunken, and therefore not palpable, but on imaging is heterogenous and nodular and the biopsy specimen severely fibrotic.\n",

Although the single largest group of acute liver failure patients in childhood is those in whom a specific etiology is not identified, it does not negate the need for a full and detailed workup.

Unfortunately these features are neither specific nor sensitive, and as much as we may like to narrow our differential diagnosis to address the most likely or most serious diagnoses first, in the situation of acute hepatic failure, all causes are life-threateningly serious, and therefore, an inclusive panel of investigation is the safest and most efficient approach. Clearly, investigations, especially for infectious causes, will be tempered by knowledge of local occurrence; we in Seattle do not, for example, routinely check for the flavivirus that causes yellow fever.
