            "text": "Telocytes (TCs) play an important role in cell\u2013cell communication with adjacent cells within the tissue via direct patterns or indirect ways, such as cellular junctions, production of multi-factors and extracellular vesicles [1, 2]. TCs maintain local tissue homeostasis and cooperate with stem cells for organ repair and regeneration in diseases, inflammation, and fibrosis [3, 4]. However, mechanisms by which bio-behaviors of TCs are regulated are still unclear. Our recent study demonstrated that the transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF\u03b21) interacted with phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and regulated the proliferation and cell cycle phases of TCs [5]. Class IA PI3K is a heterodimer composed with two types of subunits, including one regulatory subunit and three catalytic subunits (p110\u03b1, p110\u03b2, p110\u03b4). PI3K isoform proteins, e.g. PI3K\u03b1/\u03b4/\u03b2, PI3K/mTOR, and PI3K p110\u03b4, contribute to the interactions and network functions of genes or proteins during TCs proliferation, especially PI3K\u03b1/\u03b4/\u03b2. TGF\u03b21 up-regulated the expression of PIK3CA coding p110\u03b1 and PIK3CB coding p110\u03b2, while down-regulated the expression of PIK3CD coding p110\u03b4 and PIK3CG coding p110-\u03b3 in lung TCs [6]. PI3K p110\u03b1 is involved in tumor growth, hypoxia, metastasis, or cell communication by increasing the tight junction formation [7] and the activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3\u03b2) to promote cyclin D1 expression [8]. The present study furthermore investigates potential mechanisms of the interaction between TGF\u03b21 and PI3K isoforms in the regulation of TCs bio-behaviors.",

The present study aims at investigating the molecular mechanisms by which the TGF\u03b21- integrin beta1 (ITGB1)-PI3K signal pathways regulate TCs cycle and proliferation. Gene expression profiles and special network characteristics of ITG family members were investigated among murine pulmonary TCs on days 5 (TC 5) and 10 (TC 10), fibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, alveolar type II cells (ATII), airway basal cells, proximal airway cells (PACs), CD8+ T cells come from bronchial lymph nodes (CD8 T BL), and CD8+ T cells from lung (CD8 T LL), respectively, like other genes [13]. Mouse lung TC Line was applied for investigating the patterns of PI3K catalytic isoform proteins or GSK3 and the regulation of TGF-\u03b21 in TCs bio-behaviors were defined in mouse lung TCs [6].

These TCs have special characteristics including relatively small cell body and very long and thin Tps with lots of dilations (Fig. 4a). To further confirm that the cells were TCs, triple immunofluorescent staining for CD34/PDGFR-\u03b1/vimentin was used. We found that these cells were triple positive for CD34/PDGFR-\u03b1/vimentin (Fig. 2), indicating that these cells were TCs. To understand potential regulations between those factors in TCs, we firstly investigated effects of external TGF\u03b21 at different concentrations and time points on TCs with ITGB1 (TCITGB1+) and selected the concentration of TGF\u03b21 at 5 ng/ml for 48 h as the condition of further studies (Fig. 3a). ITGB1 knocked down TC cells (TCITGB1\u2212) were generated by lentivirus construction and infection with ITGB1 shRNA and evaluated by expression of ITGB1 gene (Fig. 3b). TGF\u03b21 could induced the increased cell proliferations in TCITGB1\u2212 cells at 48 h, as compared to TCITGB1+ cells (Fig. 3c). HS173 inhibited cell proliferation significantly in a dose-dependent pattern in TCITGB1+ cells with or without TGF\u03b21 administration and had higher responses about 98% inhibitory rate at 5 \u03bcM, as compared to TCITGB1\u2212 cells (Fig. 3d). The proliferation of TGF\u03b21-pretreated TCITGB1\u2212 cells was higher than vehicle-pretreated ones after HS173 administration, especially at doses of 0.05 and 0.5 \u03bcM. The cell proliferation reduced from the low dose of GDC0941 (0.05 \u03bcM, Fig. 3e), Enzastaurin (0.025 \u03bcM, Fig. 3f), or SB216763 (0.05 \u03bcM, Fig. 3g), rather than in TCITGB1\u2212 cells.

PI3K and TGF family networks in TCs differed from other cells which appear in the lung tissue and PI3K-TGF signal pathways play the critical role in the regulation of TCs proliferation and expression of PI3K isoform genes [5]. The present study furthermore investigates roles of ITGB1 in PI3K-TGF signal pathways-regulated TCs bio-behaviors. Different integrin subunits binding to the same ligand can trigger different signal transduction, and the expression patterns of integrins on cell surface is the key to determine the response of cells to microenvironments to immune and inflammatory regulation [19\u201321]. Although ITGB1 on alveolar epithelium was found to alleviate epithelial injury and remodeling in acute respiratory distress syndrome [22], profiles and functions of ITGB1 and their family members in lung TCs remain unclear due to the limited source of preliminary lung TCs. The present study firstly reported characters of ITGB family member networks and interactions in the primary mouse lung TCs, highly dependent upon cell types and functions. Of elements in TCs networks and interactions, ITGB4 declined and ITGB1 increased rapidly on day 10. We found that the interaction between PI3K and ITGB1 could complement the mechanisms of TCs proliferation and ITGB1 regulated TC sensitivity to PI3K isoform protein inhibition or PKC inhibition.",

TGF\u03b2 activation depends upon the cytoplasmic domain integrity of ITGB subunit which connects with actin cytoskeleton or the extracellular environment, e.g. specific binding of ITG\u03b1v\u03b26 and \u03b1v\u03b28 to the arm domain of Pro-TGF\u03b21 [24]. Our data suggest that ITGB1 play the decisive role in TC survival and proliferation and change TC sensitivity to stimulators or inhibitors. The deletion of ITGB1 increased the sensitivity of TCs to PI3Kp/110\u03b1, PI3K\u03b1/\u03b4, PKC\u03b2, or GSK3 inhibitors, indicating that ITGB1 contributes to multiple signal pathways and the interaction between ITGB1 and TGF\u03b2 regulates cell fate and proliferation through intracellular PI3K/PKC/GSK pathways. For example, the binding of ITG\u03b1v\u03b26 with TGF\u03b21 could regulate the production of inflammatory mediators through the activation of HMGB1 in injured epithelial cells, accelerating lung tissue repair and curing [25]. We noticed that the dose of TGF\u03b21 which did not increase TCITGB1+ proliferation could accelerate TCITGB1\u2212 proliferation, and such effects of TGF\u03b21 became more obvious when PI3K/PKC/GSK pathways were down-regulated in TCITGB1\u2212 cells, especially GSK3\u03b1 and \u03b2 signal pathways.",

It was evidenced by the finding that TGF\u03b21 increased proliferation increased in TCs with combined inhibition of ITGB1 and one of PI3K/p110\u03b1, PI3K\u03b1/\u03b4, PKC\u03b2, or GSK3\u03b2 signaling. We propose that the hyper-sensitivity of TCITGB1\u2212 with either inhibitor may result from the compensatory mechanisms of other signal pathway function or crosstalk as in other condition [26\u201328]. The interaction of ITGB-PI3K plays important roles in the maintenance of normal lung cell hemostasis and function and the response to inflammation, though it is unclear in lung TCs. For example, ITGB1 protein could regulate the activation of NF\u03baB and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in alveolar macrophage [20], control intracellular transcription, accelerate cell cycle progression, movement, survival, metabolism, and DNA damage [29]. TGF-\u03b2 regulates cell fate and plasticity as well as multifunctional cellular responses via mothers against decapentaplegic homolog (SMAD) or non-SMAD pathways or ITGB1 pathway band with fibronectins and tenascin-C PI3K/AKT pathway, as explained in Fig. 7. The conversion from oleate-activated transcription factor (PIP2) to plasma membrane intrinsic protein 3 (PIP3) regulated by PI3K isoform proteins is the central process of the interaction between Akt and GSK or between PKC and Akt directly or indirectly [30\u201332].",

            "text": "It is also possible that PI3K inhibitors could inhibit the fibrinogen/tenascin-C binding to ITG\u03b1IIb\u03b23 by inducing GTPase-Rap1 or the PI3K p110\u03b2 and PI3K p110\u03b3 directly as downstream integrins by inducing activation of G protein-coupled receptors [30]. Figure 7 demonstrates that integrins regulate the activity of PI3K signaling pathway and cause the accumulation of PIP3. ITG\u03b12\u03b21 was found to activate PI3K p110\u03b2, RasGRP2, or GTP binding to Rap1b, to amplify the activation of ITG\u03b12\u03b21signals and forming regulatory feedback loops around the cell membrane [31]. The interaction between ITGB-PI3K could influence the selective bind to ITG\u03b1v\u03b23 receptor to regulate cell cycle, cell proliferation and cell migration [32]. Our results demonstrate that ITGB1 plays the significant role in the regulation of TC proliferation, since the inhibition of PI3Kp110\u03b1, PI3K\u03b1/\u03b4, or PKC\u03b2 caused the increase in S phase of TCs with ITGB1, while mainly in G1 phase in TCs without ITGB1, different from the inhibition of GSK3\u03b2. We hypothesize that PIK3CG gene and protein p110-\u03b3 may play the regulatory roles in cell cycle responses to TGF and those inhibitors in the absence of ITGB1. PI3K/Akt plays important roles in the molecular mechanism of cell cycle and survival through the signals of Akt/PKC/nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) and GSK-3 [33] and regulates GSK-3\u03b2-dominated downstream survival signaling pathway of serine/threonine kinase [34]. Our results indicate that both TGF-\u03b2-band type II and type I serine and threonine kinase receptors (T\u03b2RII and T\u03b2RI) and ITGB1 can activate PI3K signal pathway either via the switch of the heterotetrameric receptor complex from inactivated to activated T\u03b2RII and T\u03b2RI or via the switch of the integrin-mediated focal adhesion kinase signaling from inactivated to activated ITGB1. Both switches are required for the activation of class IA PI3K mediated by TGF\u03b21 [35] and also result in the activation of PI3Kp110\u03b1, PI3K\u03b1/\u03b4, PKC\u03b2, or GSK3 (Fig. 8). Molecules and networks in the TGF\u03b2/ITGB1/PI3K pathways can be considered as TC-specific functional biomarkers and therapeutic targets like others [36\u201340].",

The deletion of ITGB1 changed TCs sensitivity to treatment with multifunctional cytokines or signal pathway inhibitors. The compensatory mechanisms may occur among TGF\u03b21-induced PI3Kp110\u03b1, PI3K\u03b1/\u03b4, PKC\u03b2, or GSK3 when ITGB1 gene was deleted, leading to alterations of TCs cell cycle and proliferation. Of those PI3K isoform protein genes, mRNA expression of PIK3CG altered with ITGB1-negative TC cycle and proliferation. Such compensatory mechanism can provide insights for understanding molecular mechanisms by which TCs have strong capacity of proliferation and repair and of cell\u2013cell communication and for investigating the potential roles of TCs in the development of drug resistance.",
