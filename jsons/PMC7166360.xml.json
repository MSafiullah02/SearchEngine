            "text": "In this paper, we examine the proposition that politicians and their affiliated firms (i.e., firms operating in the politician's province) suppress negative information in response to incentives created by political events that temporarily increase the cost of releasing bad news. Prior research argues that politicians and governments like to avoid negative news about their activities (e.g., Peltzman [1976], Watts and Zimmerman [1986]). To the extent that certain events asymmetrically increase the cost of releasing bad news, local politicians will have a heightened incentive to temporarily restrict the flow of negative information about firms under their control or influence. Similarly, self\u2010interested firms reliant on the support of local politicians will also respond to the incentives created by the political event. If these temporary incentives are sufficiently strong, the result will be a reduced flow of negative information in advance of the events, followed by an increase in the flow of negative information after the event as previously suppressed information is subsequently released. For publicly traded companies, the temporary suppression of negative information will generate a distinct shift in stock price crash behavior around the political event if the market is unable to fully unravel the suppression of bad news.",

            "text": "We test these arguments by examining the stock price behavior of Chinese listed firms around two highly anticipated political events\u2014meetings of the National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and promotions of high\u2010level provincial politicians\u2014over the period 1993 to 2011. We employ a stock price crash methodology specifically designed to capture the suppression and subsequent release of value\u2010relevant negative information (e.g., Chen, Hong, and Stein [2001], Jin and Myers [2006]). We focus on Chinese listed firms because their information environment is expected to be sensitive to political incentives for opacity. In China, government and party officials exert significant influence on listed firms through direct ownership arrangements and/or indirect channels (e.g., bureaucracy, regulation, licensing requirements, and informal political and social networks); this influence creates a conduit by which listed firms are expected to align their behavior with the preferences of local politicians. We focus on meetings of the National Congress and provincial\u2010level promotions as these two events temporarily increase the political costs of revealing bad news. From a career concerns perspective, local politicians incur a personal cost when firms under their control report poor performance, as adverse economic news limits their advancement within the party structure (e.g., Chen, Li, and Zhou [2005], Li and Zhou [2005]). More generally, authoritarian governments like China need to demonstrate strengths to stay in power (e.g., Tullock [1987]). The revelation of bad news about Chinese firms and their political supervisors reveals weaknesses, disrupts the government's narrative, and impacts social harmony. In both cases, the revelation of bad news is very costly to both local politicians and their affiliated firms during these event windows, generating a heightened incentive to suppress negative information. Finally, China's institutional arrangements, such as weak regulatory enforcement, limited private enforcement opportunities, concentrated ownership structures, and relationship\u2010based contracting, may be insufficient to support the necessary incentives for transparency during these periods.",

            "text": "However, there exist countervailing forces capable of sheltering listed firms from these transitory political pressures. First, the conversion of state enterprises to joint stock companies and their subsequent listing on stock exchanges expose state\u2010controlled firms to western governance mechanisms and market forces that demand transparency. Second, the Chinese government also set up the State Asset Supervision and Administration Commission to further decentralize control power from central and local governments to the listed firms. Qian [1996] and Fan, Wong, and Zhang [2013] argue that the Chinese government has established structural wedges between politicians and listed firms to credibly commit to not intervene in these firms\u2019 day\u2010to\u2010day operations. Third, suppression of negative information is inherently difficult. Successful suppression requires politicians to have control over an array of information dissemination and production mechanisms that prevent self\u2010interested market participants and competing politicians from leaking negative information. Finally, the market could interpret silence during political periods as bad news; this unraveling would eliminate the expected political benefits of suppression. To the extent that these factors effectively mitigate the influence of local politicians\u2019 incentives for opacity, we should not observe Chinese listed firms responding to transitory pressures to suppress bad news around political events. More generally, we expect firms most (least) exposed to strong market (political) forces, such as firms with weak political connections, non\u2010state\u2010owned firms, or firms operating in market\u2010oriented provinces or in provinces without powerful local politicians, to be less sensitive to transitory political incentives.",

            "text": "Consistent with the bad news suppression predictions, we find that affiliated listed firms are significantly less (more) likely to experience stock price crashes in advance of (after) our two political events. Mirroring the theoretical predictions of Chen, Hong, and Stein [2001], this intertemporal pattern is consistent with the initial suppression, and subsequent release, of adverse news in response to the heightened incentives of the local politicians and affiliated firms. These results are robust to alternative empirical specifications and various empirical measures of stock price crash behavior and information flow (including stock price synchronicity). Our evidence suggests that the incentives and ability of the politicians to suppress bad news outweigh the countervailing factors that promote transparency from decentralization of control of listed firms and the economic development of the provinces in China. The China market's inability to unravel the deferral of bad news is consistent with the evidence in Giglio and Shue [2014] indicating that a more developed U.S. market also underreacts to information contained in the absence of news. In additional analyses, we document the strongest reduction in stock price crashes in the three months preceding the political events, consistent with the heightened incentives to suppress bad news being most acute in the last few months leading up to the event. Further highlighting the role of political costs in this setting, our evidence shows that the incentive to suppress negative information varies based upon the level of political connections of the firms, and whether the local politicians belong to a political faction or are offspring of old CCP revolutionaries.",

Specifically, suppression effects are found in both state\u2010owned and non\u2010state\u2010owned firms and are unaffected by firm and provincial\u2010level proxies for capital market\u2010based pressures. Also contrary to expectations, we find that Hong Kong\u2010listed Chinese firms, arguably better regulated and subject to stronger market forces and more sophisticated investors, also experience a reduction in stock price crashes prior to both events. On the one hand, the robustness of the suppression effect across ownership types, capital market proxies, and markets where the firms are listed raises puzzles on how the government can orchestrate such extensive information control; on the other hand, this robustness highlights the power that Chinese politicians continue to wield over both the state and nonstate sectors despite China's state\u2010owned enterprise (SOE) reforms and the regulatory and market pressures found in both domestic and Hong Kong markets.",

Despite the absence of intervention from the government through direct ownership control, non\u2010state firms may voluntarily engage in bad news suppression in order to build the needed connections and trust with politicians that is enjoyed by their counterparts in the state sector. Although the pressures and channels to increase transparency greatly increase in more developed provinces and the Hong Kong market, there are also counterbalancing political forces to heighten the suppression incentives in these settings. Negative news about firms operating in more developed regions and/or specially chosen for a Hong Kong listing is likely to generate greater embarrassment to the politicians; this effect arises because these particular firms are visible and under greater scrutiny by a public expecting superior performance from them. Finally, notwithstanding our recognition of the difficulty in suppressing bad news among listed firms in China, we have documented evidence consistent with the conjecture that political incentives can influence newspaper reporting around these political events. More specifically, we document that the number of newspaper articles published about the listed firms in both official and financial newspapers temporarily decreases in advance of these political events, which is suggestive of the government's ability in controlling one channel of the listed firms\u2019 information environment.",

Despite the government's efforts to decentralize state\u2010controlled firms and develop the domestic stock market, Chinese listed firms are found to be sensitive to acute political incentives for opacity. Relative to the extant literature, our paper has several contributions. First, we examine a dimension of opacity\u2014the suppression of negative information\u2014that has not been explored in prior research yet maps strongly into the prevailing preferences of politicians. Second, we utilize an empirical methodology that captures both the suppression and the subsequent release of negative information; the documentation of this theoretically predicted intertemporal pattern is novel to the accounting literature and eliminates many of the alternative interpretations of the pre\u2010event period patterns alone. Third, through the joint use of intertemporal and cross\u2010sectional proxies for heightened political costs, we minimize misspecification concerns found in a time\u2010series or cross\u2010sectional analyses alone, thus strengthening the link between transitory political costs, information suppression incentives, and observed stock price behavior. Finally, by examining changes in a stock price\u2013based measure of negative information flow\u2014the negative skewness of excess returns (i.e., stock price crash statistic)\u2014we capture information effects beyond those contained in accounting, audit choice, or disclosure data alone. By construction, this stock price measure captures the net flow of all value\u2010relevant, adverse information through all available information channels; as such, the measure reflects news from the full set of information production and dissemination mechanisms that the local politician must control to effectively suppress negative information. From a research design perspective, this approach allows us to determine whether aggregate changes in accounting, reporting, disclosure, and dissemination practices around these political events have a net impact on the overall information environment of listed firms (as captured by observable stock price behavior).",

Although we are unable to document the exact mechanisms through which the suppression of negative information occurs, our tests have the ability to refute our information suppression hypotheses. Our results provide a useful starting point for future research seeking to identify the exact channels by which politicians and the listed firms temporarily suppress the net flow of negative information around politically sensitive events, such as a reduction in firm\u2010level disclosures, issuing biased financial reports, self\u2010censorship by the media, direct censorship by the politician, and the adoption of disclosure (e.g., bundling) and/or trading strategies to camouflage negative information, and how these channels of suppression actually work across ownership types and political connection levels of the firms, provinces where the firms operate, and the markets where the firms are listed. Given the increased opportunity for investors to purchase shares in both Chinese firms and other politically affiliated firms around the world, understanding the impact of short\u2010term political incentives on the underlying financial reporting and information environment of these listed companies is a first\u2010order concern for market participants.",

Greater transparency benefits both the listed firm and the economy by improving the monitoring capabilities of both the state and outside investors, reducing information gathering costs, improving the efficiency of capital allocation and investment decisions, increasing foreign investment, lowering the firm's and country's cost of capital and, ultimately, increasing economic growth. However, because the incentives of local politicians and their affiliated firms are frequently not aligned with value or wealth maximization, transparency, especially with respect to the revelation of bad news, is costly. Transparency about state\u2010controlled entities highlights inefficiencies, political agendas, and economic disparities that exist within these firms (e.g., Shleifer and Vishny [1997], Rajan and Zingales [2003]).1 Similarly, transparency about both state\u2010controlled and non\u2010state\u2010owned firms under the local politician's supervision can bring unwanted scrutiny, especially with respect to policy failures, favoritism, and corruption, and limit the ability of politicians and executives to consume their private benefits of control by exposing weak governance practices, expropriation, and rent\u2010seeking behavior. The revelation of poor operating performance by affiliated firms also imposes personal costs upon local politicians and the firm's executives in the form of diminished reputational capital and damaged career prospects. Because of these costs, affiliated, self\u2010interested firms are expected to adopt information practices that minimize the expected political costs associated with reporting adverse news. More importantly, incentives to suppress negative information are expected to be temporarily heightened in advance of political events that incrementally increase the costs of revelation.",

            "text": "China offers a natural setting to examine how acute political incentives affect the incentives of listed firms to temporarily suppress bad news. In general, Chinese listed firms are associated with weak financial reporting practices (see Piotroski and Wong [2012] for a summary). The reporting outcomes are shaped by institutional arrangements (e.g., concentrated ownership, relationship\u2010based contracting, and weak investor protections) that minimize both the demand for and supply of high\u2010quality external reports. Despite these institutional arrangements, there are several reasons why Chinese listed firms may not respond to transitory incentives to suppress negative information. First, the decentralization of state\u2010owned companies, through government reforms and the stock exchange listing process, creates a structural wedge between politicians and local state\u2010controlled firms (e.g., Qian [1996], Fan, Wong, and Zhang [2013]). If effective, this operational autonomy, and resultant reliance on external (nonstate) financing and use of professional management, can potentially insulate state\u2010controlled firms from the day\u2010to\u2010day influence of local politicians. Second, the maturation of China's capital markets and emergence of non\u2010state\u2010owned enterprises have increased the relative importance of both market and reputational incentives; given that these benefits rely upon a credible commitment for transparency, they may act as a countervailing force against transitory political incentives. Robust capital markets are also associated with additional channels by which negative information could be leaked by self\u2010interested market participants or competing politicians. Third, sophisticated investors may unravel silence in advance of political events as bad news; this unraveling would eliminate the expected benefits of temporarily suppressing negative information. Finally, the suppression of negative news is inherently difficult, requiring politicians to directly or indirectly control a broad array of information channels and self\u2010interested individuals.",

Shih, Adolph, and Liu [2012] argue that favored provincial politicians are strategically placed in growing regions prior to their elevation to a position of more power, thus bringing legitimacy to their political advancement.

Unexpected negative information also reveals weaknesses and results in a \u201closs of face\u201d for both local politicians and the central government. In addition, Chinese culture values social conformity and the maintenance of relationships, with government policy during the latter half of our sample period explicitly stressing the importance of maintaining social harmony. The existence of these cultural norms and policies creates significant incentives for politicians and executives to not disrupt the government's narrative around visible political events. These norms and policies also create a disciplining mechanism by which informed individuals, such as rival politicians, do not voluntarily release negative information for personal gain.",

This variation would enable us to test whether such political forces are related to the occurrence and degree of bad news suppression in advance of political events. We have a number of ways to capture this variation. First, the activities of politically connected firms and executives are likely to be more scrutinized than firms and executives without political connections. We expect that these relationships, and the political benefits and repercussions it can bring, potentially raise the relative cost of releasing bad news for affected firms, politicians, and executives. Second, we expect that politicians promoted on the basis of faction politics or family relations (rather than meritocracy), and the central government officials sponsoring them, have stronger incentives to suppress any bad news leading up to the promotion announcement in order to bring legitimacy to their advancement. Additionally, these same, powerful politicians are more likely to be able to exercise influence over listed firms and information dissemination channels than politicians lacking this political clout. Third, state\u2010controlled firms, which ultimately report to the local politician, typically suffer from numerous inefficiencies and agency conflicts; as a result, politicians have both the ability and motive to suppress negative information about these companies.4 However, local politicians can also influence the reporting and disclosure incentives of non\u2010state\u2010owned firms through conferring or denying benefits to non\u2010state\u2010owned entities such as access to capital and other investment opportunities (e.g., Chen and Yuan [2004]). Thus, these nonstate firms may even have just as strong an incentive to suppress bad news as state firms in order to establish close ties with politicians. It remains an empirical question whether the political incentives to temporarily suppress bad news are sufficiently strong to influence both state and nonstate firms or are limited to state\u2010controlled firms. Finally, we expect that firms operating in provinces with greater capital market development, issued B\u2010shares that are owned by foreign investors, and listed in the Hong Kong market are more sheltered from political pressures to defer the release of bad news during the two political events.",

In their seminal paper, Watts and Zimmerman [1978] argue that accounting choices are influenced by the expected political costs associated with given financial reporting outcomes. These political costs can range from heightened tax burdens (e.g., windfall profits tax) to the outright expropriation of the firms\u2019 productive assets, and also include a host of indirect taxes such as heightened regulation or the threat of greater government intervention into the firm's business activities. Consistent with these arguments, existing research using international (i.e., non\u2010U.S.) data finds that firms tend to remain opaque in the presence of strong political economy forces, as measured by level of state ownership of assets, greater risk of expropriation, and the presence of political connections (e.g., Bushman, Piotroski, and Smith [2004], Bushman and Piotroski [2006], Gul [2006], Leuz and Oberholzer\u2010Gee [2006], Wang, Wong, and Xia [2008], Chaney, Faccio, and Parsley [2011], Durnev and Guriev [2011]).

Given those theoretical relations, we use the observed pattern of stock price behavior to infer the suppression of negative information around events that create an ex ante incentive for such behavior. Specifically, a decline in negative skewness during an event window is interpreted as a temporary reduction in the flow of negative information about these firms. A subsequent increase in large negative stock price movements immediately following the event window (i.e., greater negative skewness) reflects the release of the previously suppressed negative information.8\n",

These promotion events are visible and anticipated by economic agents in the province. Because the party secretary and governor are the top two positions in a province, these promotions create a tournament\u2010like contest for personal advancement within the provincial political and communist party structure; thus, all politicized agents in the province have an incentive to window\u2010dress economic performance before these events. Moreover, the central government can exert pressure on local firms to improve the credentials of the identified provincial officials before their promotion. This top\u2010down pressure also prevents local political rivals from releasing bad news to undermine the credentials of the soon\u2010to\u2010be\u2010elevated provincial politician. Because of the planned nature of political transitions in China, politicians and affected firms have a well\u2010defined window (usually 12 to 18 months) over which these incentives arise (Shih, Adolph, and Liu [2012]). Prior research shows that political promotions in China are influenced by the recent performance of the region (Chen, Li, and Zhou [2005], Li and Zhou [2005]); as such, it is costly for local politicians and managers to release negative financial information about local state\u2010controlled firms in advance of the appointment. Additionally, non\u2010state\u2010owned firms also have heightened incentives in advance of these promotion events given the importance of maintaining strong relationships with local politicians, as such relations grant the firm preferential access to capital and investment opportunities and reduced bureaucracy. Given the duration of the evaluation process, we define our event window as the year preceding and containing the promotion event (years \u20121 to 0). Firms that operate in the same province as the promoted politician are considered to be those affected by these promotion events. Data on political promotion events are hand\u2010collected by searching information published in the \u201cChinese Personnel Database\u201d and \u201cChina VIPs\u201d from China Information Bank and supplemented by Google web searches.",

Firm size, measured as the log of the firm's market value of equity at the end of year t (LogSizei,t), is expected to be negatively related to negative skewness, as larger firms are less likely to experience dramatic price declines due to their diverse set of operations and their rich information environment.

The negative skewness of residual returns is expected to be decreasing in Betai,t and Sigmai,t because the distribution of payoffs to risky projects is positively skewed.10 The inclusion of Sigma is also important in this setting because political risk is associated with stock return volatility (Boutchkova, Doshi, and Durnev [2012]).

First, both the transitory suppression, and subsequent release, of negative information is incrementally stronger around promotion events involving politicians affiliated with the Shanghai faction. This amplification of promotion behavior is consistent with these incumbent, faction\u2010affiliated politicians bearing larger costs if adverse news is revealed and possessing greater power to temporarily suppress the information before their promotion. For the National Congress meetings, we find firms in provinces controlled by Shanghai\u2010faction\u2010affiliated politicians to exhibit more bad news suppression prior to the event, but there are no significantly more negative information releases after the event. Second, princelings and nonprincelings engage in similar levels of suppression in advance of our two political events. However, firms affiliated with princelings experience larger stock price crashes following these events (as noted by the positive coefficient on the term Post\u2010Politicali,t \u00d7 Attributei,t in both estimations).18 One possible reason for the less consistent results for the National Congress meetings with the Shanghai\u2010faction\u2010affiliated politicians and the two political events for the princelings is the lack of power in the tests. The politicians\u2019 factional affiliations may have a stronger effect on the release of bad news around their promotions than National Congress meetings. Also, not all princelings in our sample exert the same level of power as the Shanghai\u2010faction\u2010affiliated politicians, which could contribute to the weaker results for the two events involving princelings. Further, the cumulative suppression effects around political promotions for firms operating in provinces controlled by princelings or members of the Shanghai faction are significantly stronger than provinces not controlled by these powerful politicians. This variation is consistent with the characteristics of local politicians, and resultant incentives, shaping the information environment of listed firms around these political events.",

However, comparing across estimations, we find that the promotion period effect is significantly more pronounced among state\u2010controlled firms, consistent with the politician bearing greater costs for the release of negative news about state firms around these highly visible national events. For both sets of firms, this decline is followed by the predicted increase in negative stock return skewness in the year immediately following the National Congress. Focusing on impending provincial\u2010level promotion events, the incentives appear to affect both types of firms equally. Specifically, the intertemporal pattern of significantly lower Ncskewi,t before the promotion, followed by significantly higher Ncskewi,t after the event, is statistically and economically similar across the two types of firms. Taken together, the results suggest that state ownership heightens incentives to suppress negative news prior to the National Congress meetings, but has no incremental effect on either the subsequent releases of the news after the meeting or bad news suppression and subsequent releases around political promotion. This is consistent with the conjecture that local politicians can, through indirect intervention, exert equally strong pressure on nonstate firms to control the release of bad news, especially around their promotions, and/or nonstate firms have an equally strong incentive as the state firms to engage in strategic news releases because the former need to build political connections with the politicians.",

The most direct route for Chinese firms to access foreign markets, especially during our sample period, is through an H\u2010share listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. If Hong Kong institutions create credible reporting incentives, H\u2010share listings should exert a positive influence on the disclosure practices of listed Chinese firms. However, a Hong Kong listing may fail to produce bonding\u2010related benefits for Chinese firms. For example, Hung, Wong, and Zhang [2012] find that Chinese state\u2010owned firms\u2019 overseas listing decisions are primarily determined by politicians\u2019 agendas, with the performance of these overseas listed firms deteriorating following the foreign listing. Absent bonding benefits, a Hong Kong listing would have no effect on reporting incentives around political events. Finally, Chinese firms listed on foreign exchanges are the most prominent and visible Chinese companies. The release of bad news by these firms during one of our political event windows is expected to impose a large, visible cost on the local politician and central government; as such, these Hong Kong listed firms could face strong countervailing incentives to temporarily suppress the release of bad news during politically sensitive event periods.",

Instead, contrary to our expectations, the suppression effect is actually incrementally stronger for visible, Hong Kong listed firms domiciled in a province experiencing a political promotion. The heightened level of suppression among these Hong Kong listed firms is consistent with the overseas listings decision of Chinese firms being politically motivated; any bad news of these firms during politically sensitive events will bring greater embarrassment to their affiliated politicians. 20 This evidence casts further doubt on the ability of a Hong Kong listing to fully resolve governance weaknesses among China's listed entities.",

The indicator variable Market Development equals one if the province ranks in the top half of the distribution in year t, zero otherwise. The second proxy, B\u2010shares, is an indicator variable equal to one if the firm also issued a class of tradable B\u2010shares. Given that B\u2010shares are targeted for foreign investors, the existence of B\u2010share securities increases the firm's exposure to sophisticated, transparency\u2010demanding investors compared to firms only trading in the A\u2010share market (i.e., only domestic investors). The existence of B\u2010share prices also provides additional information signals to A\u2010share market participants.

The lack of variation across these settings suggests that either our empirical proxies failed to capture meaningful variation in market\u2010based incentives or that market forces are not sufficiently developed in China to create the necessary offsetting incentives during these politically charged periods. It could also be that the increase in market forces that promote transparency in decentralized, well\u2010developed provinces are counterbalanced by the heighten incentives for politicians to suppress bad news when the public has a higher expectation of its firms to report good performance.",

In general, politicians and affiliated firms are expected to have been disclosing good news in a timely manner; such timely disclosure is inherently in line with their incentives. If politicians always report good news in a timely fashion, one would expect no incremental effect on good news disclosures during event periods, absent the production of new information by the politician.

Specifically, the frequency with which firms experience large positive stock returns (i.e., stock price jump) will therefore decrease in the year prior to the political events and increase during the political events. Such behavior is reasonable if the expected benefits of releasing good news are higher in the political event period than the preceding period. Moreover, given the planned and highly anticipated nature of the two political events in our study, affected agents will certainly have an opportunity to strategically time the release of good news through such a deferral mechanism. To test this good news deferral conjecture, we measure the percentage of weeks in a given year that the firm experiences a large price increase. A positive weekly excess return more than 1.96 standard deviations above the sample mean or a price increase greater than 20% is considered a large stock price increase. The empirical results do not support this good news deferral conjecture (see online appendix, tables A, B, and C). We are neither able to document a significantly lower frequency of price jumps in the one\u2010year period preceding the start of our respective political events, nor do we find any heightened incidence of stock price jumps during the two political event windows. 27 There is also no evidence that Ncskewi,t is significantly higher in this preevent period, as would occur if good news were withheld. In addition, the failure to document an increase in stock price jump frequency during the political event windows casts doubt on the explanation that an increase in good news production and/or dissemination is responsible for the empirical stock price crash results documented in this paper.",

We encourage future research to exploit similar political settings to contextually examining the channels and mechanisms used by politicians and affiliated firms to temporarily suppress the flow of negative information into stock prices.
