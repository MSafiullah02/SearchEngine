In India, the strategy of HIV testing of all newly diagnosed tuberculosis patients is neither feasible nor cost-effective, due to the large number of new cases of tuberculosis that are detected each year. The standard treatment regimens used in the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP), are equally effective in HIV positive patients. Directly Observed Treatment, Short Course (DOTS) strategy has been shown to improve survival of patients with co-infection. Concurrent treatment with protease inhibitors can either reduce activity or prolong half-life of rifampicin. Chemoprophylaxis against tuberculosis is currently not recommended in India.",

Owing to their small size, they can directly lodge in the terminal alveoli of the lungs by avoiding the mucociliary defences of the bronchi. A single cough can produce up to 3,000 droplet nuclei that remain suspended in air for prolonged periods. Transmission by droplet nuclei generally occurs indoors and in the dark because direct sunlight can kill Tubercle bacilli within 5 minutes (Harries et al., 2004) . Milk-borne tuberculosis is spread by consumption of milk from cattle infected by M. bovis. Infection of the tonsils presents as cervical lymphadenitis (\"scrofula\"). The intestinal tract may also be infected (Harries et al., 2004) . Since milk is boiled before consumption in India, milk-borne tuberculosis is not a public health problem.",

Poverty is also accompanied by under-nutrition, lack of access to health care and poor living conditions such as poor ventilation, lack of safe drinking water, and inadequate sanitation. Workers exposed to silica-containing dust are also vulnerable. These factors compromise the body's ability to fight infections. Therefore, poor people are more vulnerable to tuberculosis, as compared to their relatively affluent counterparts. Thus, tuberculosis control programmes can succeed only if the socio-economic condition of the target population is improved. Due to losses in earnings, many families are forced to sell their land or livestock, or take their children out of school. These school dropouts help out with domestic chores or work outside their homes as child labourers. In India, 300,000 children from tuberculosis-afflicted households are forced to leave school every year (HAIN, 2003) .",

Critics point out that the DOTS programme will only be as efficient as the public health services of the country where it is being implemented. In countries where the basic health services are inadequate, the long-term sustainability of DOTS is endangered. The current treatment regimens involve the use of four or five antitubercular drugs, to be taken for at least 6 months. Studies reveal that most patients stop treatment after the initial 2-3 months since the symptoms are relieved. Poor compliance to treatment increases the risk of multi-drug resistance. If the treatment is stopped after 2 months, the estimated risk of relapse is 70 per cent, while after 4 months it is 40 per cent (HAIN, 2003) .",

Among those infected by M. tuberculosis, it is estimated that the lifetime risk of progression from latent to clinically active tuberculosis is 50 per cent (i.e. about 10 times higher) in HIV positive individuals, as compared to the lifetime risk of 5-10 per cent faced by their HIV negative counterparts (Harries et al., 2004) . HIV infection along with active tuberculosis leads to depletion of CD4 lymphocytes, increased multiplication of HIV, and elevated plasma levels of HIV-RNA. In HIV positive individuals, progressive depletion of CD4 cells results in predominance of CD8 cells and DTH, which helps the re-activation of primary tubercular infection and dissemination of the disease. In pulmonary tuberculosis, HIV also impairs the innate resistance of alveolar macrophages. Thus, HIV and M. tuberculosis form a deadly alliance (WHO, 2002) . Besides complicating the diagnosis of tuberculosis, HIV contributes to increase in incidence of tuberculosis Raviglione et al., 1992) .

Most reactions occur in the first 2 months of treatment. Skin rash and hepatitis is attributed to rifampicin. Rifampicin can reduce the activity of several drugs used in HIVinfected patients. Thiacetazone is usually associated with exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Therefore, thiacetazone should never be given to HIV-positive tuberculosis patients and should not be prescribed in areas where HIV prevalence is high (Narain & Lo, 2004) .",

The degree of immune suppression is the most important predictor of survival of HIVinfected patients with tuberculosis and low CD4 counts are associated with high mortality (Narain & Lo, 2004) . Tuberculosis occurs earlier in the course of progression of HIV infection, when CD4 counts are around 400 cells per \u00b5L.

More than 2-3 million HIV-infected persons in India are also afflicted with tuberculosis (HAIN, 2003) . Accelerated HIV-Induced Immune Suppression: Active tuberculosis is associated with transient depletion of CD4 lymphocytes. Tuberculosis increases production of cytokines like tumour necrosis factor (TNF) which increases replication of HIV in vitro. HIV-infected persons with tuberculosis appear to have higher risk of opportunistic infections and death, as compared to their counterparts with similar CD4 counts, but without tuberculosis.",

In India, the Tuberculosis Research Centre, Chennai is conducting clinical trials on ofloxacin, which can shorten the duration of treatment to 4 months. A combination of gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin is also under trial. The GFATM has developed a new drug called PA-824, which appears to be effective against multidrugresistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). This drug acts like a \"Trojan Horse\" and \"fools\" the mycobacterium to come out of its dormant state. The drug then destroys the mycobacterial cell wall (Bezbaruah, 2004) .",

Currently, 33 research projects are underway, for developing drug delivery systems and bio-enhancers for tuberculosis treatment. In September 2004, NMITL announced the discovery of a new antitubercular drug named sudoterb. Pre-clinical studies show that the drug is relatively less toxic and is compatible with the currently used antitubercular drugs. A multi-drug regimen that includes sudoterb may bring down the treatment period from 6-12 months to just 2 months. Patent protection has been secured in India and the United States. The team has applied to the Drug Controller of India for permission to start clinical tests. Three phases of clinical trials may be conducted over a 4-year period after which, the drug can be marketed (Kashyap, 2004) .",

By the end of 2001, the population covered by DOTS increased to 45 per cent and the number of DOTS-notified smear positive cases nearly doubled. But at the national level, the total numbers of smear positive cases (both DOTS and non-DOTS taken together) changed little. In order to reach the targeted case detection rate of 70 per cent, DOTS must be extended geographically and at the same time, the proportion of cases detected under DOTS programme must be increased. The cure rate for patients registered in the year 2000 was 84 per cent(HAIN, 2003). The World Bank has provided a loan of US$142.5 million to the government of India. Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA), Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM), and Global Development Fund financially support the DOTS expansion programme(HAIN, 2003).",
