            "text": "The official beginning of canine influenza was with the identification of an influenza virus in cases of respiratory disease in greyhounds in the racing industry of the United States in March 2004.3 For several years preceding this discovery, the racing industry had been plagued by frequent outbreaks of respiratory disease that caused significant economic losses despite standard prevention methods including vaccination. Attempts to identify the cause of these outbreaks failed to consistently identify an agent that could be linked to the acute respiratory disease cases. With the identification of influenza virus associated with one outbreak, serologic testing on other animals linked to the racing industry quickly determined that the exposure to what became known as the CIV was widespread. Additional isolates from greyhounds were identified in Texas in July 20043 and Iowa in April 2005.9\n",

Even with the earliest CIV isolates, there were amino acid changes in the HA protein that distinguished CIV from the EIVs circulating in the United States. Questions concerning the origin of this virus and its genetic drift became active areas of interest. To date, all CIV isolates examined belong to a single lineage, that is, the data point to a single introduction of a unique variant of EIV (Donis RO, Atlanta, GA, personal communication, June 2010.)3, 4 These analyses include CIV isolates from Florida, New York, Colorado, and all areas into which CIV was carried from these 3 enzootic areas. As with all influenza viruses, genetic drift is occurring as the virus continues to circulate in dogs. There is some suggestion that should the virus continue to circulate, unique clades may develop that are linked to the geographic centers of infection, not unlike what has happened with EIV.",

Best estimates are that this event may have occurred in 1999\u20132000. No CIV isolates exist before 2003, and serologic data may not be of help because of the ability of EIV to infect dogs. The key biologic difference between EIV and CIV is the ability of CIV to be transmitted from dog to dog. Experimental infections have clearly shown transmissibility of CIV.10 Some confusion was caused by reports of the presence of antibodies to CIV in dogs in the United Kingdom.11 It soon became evident that EIV could infect dogs, but the virus was not transmitted beyond the initial focus of infection. This discovery was confirmed during the large epizootic outbreak of EIV in Australia in 2007, where EIV was transmitted to dogs from horses on the affected farms. The infections were detected by RT-PCR and serology, but no evidence of transmission to contact dogs was found.12 Experimentally, EIV was transmitted from infected horses to in-contact dogs.13 Because EIV and CIV are antigenically very similar, standard serologic tests cannot distinguish between infections caused by EIV or CIV. Accordingly, serologic data indicating low levels of CIV infection should not be given credibility in the absence of isolation of an influenza virus with the genetic signature of CIV.",

Transmission of the virus among dogs readily occurs in group-housing situations such as animal shelters and boarding kennels, but the areas of the country where the virus is now enzootic are limited. The reasons for this defined geographic limitation are unknown. Outbreaks of CIV have occurred outside the enzootic areas of Florida, New York/Philadelphia, and Denver, but the virus has so far failed to become established in new areas (Dubovi, unpublished observations). CIV was isolated in San Diego (2006), Los Angeles (2007), Pittsburgh (2007), and Northern Virginia (2009), and dogs that tested positive in RT-PCR tests for CIV were detected in the Chicago area (2008), but none of these population centers have maintained the virus. CIV travels with dogs, and sporadic outbreaks have occurred in kennels that received rescue dogs taken from an enzootic area. Quarantine of the affected kennels stopped the spread of the virus. As with other mammalian-influenza virus interactions, there is no evidence for a true carrier state, so the maintenance of the virus depends on acute infections of susceptible populations. Although the virus is transmissible among dogs, it is not highly contagious perhaps because of the low amount of virus produced by the infected dogs (Dubovi, unpublished observation, 2007).14\n",

In 2003, it was noted that this virus was capable of infecting felines, both domestic and exotics in zoo settings. The infections were initiated through the consumption of infected poultry. In October 2004, a 1-year-old dog in Thailand with severe respiratory signs died several days after ingesting a duck carcass from an area where the avian H5N1 virus was detected.15 An influenza virus was isolated from tissues of the dog, and its genetic signature matched the H5N1 circulating in that area of Thailand.16 The H5N1 virus clearly was capable of infecting mammals, but transmission from mammal to mammal was questionable.",

In a second experimental infection, the exposed dogs again showed no clinical signs, but the virus could be detected by RT-PCR for several days.18 Tests for influenza virus receptors in the respiratory tract of the dogs indicated that sialic acid\u2013containing oligosaccharides existed on epithelial cells, and thus supported the possibility of influenza virus binding to sialic acid, leading to infection. Neither of the studies used the virus isolated from the fatal infection in Thailand, so a lack of clinical signs in the experimental infections could have been due to the use of a less-virulent isolate. At present, there is no evidence for transmission of H5N1 from an initially infected dog to a contact animal.

Nasal swabs from the affected dogs were inoculated into embryonated chicken eggs, and influenza virus was isolated from the cases.19 Sequence analysis of the virus revealed it to be an avian-origin H3N2 virus. Comparisons with data in GenBank for all 8 gene segments revealed 95.5% to 98.9% homology to avian influenza viruses in East Asia. No contemporary avian isolates circulating in South Korea at the time of the canine infections were available for direct comparison with the canine isolates. It is not clear at present whether the virus involved in these cases was simply an avian virus with enhanced capability to infect dogs or a virus with a unique genetic signature enabling transmission in dogs, as with CIV. Virus isolated from the affected dogs was used to experimentally inoculate 10-week-old puppies, and the exposed animals showed typical signs of an acute respiratory infection within 2 days after infection.20 Virus was recovered from nasal swabs, and sequence analysis showed that the recovered virus was identical to that used to initial the infection. The amount of virus shed in the experimentally infected animals significantly exceeded that found for the H3N8 CIV, suggesting that the H3N2 subtype is capable of more extensive replication in dogs. Although a dog-to-dog transmission study was also reported, the results were ambiguous because of the possibility that the in-contact dogs became infected by the original inoculum.",

A clinician would find it hard, if not impossible, to distinguish the disease caused by an influenza virus infection from that caused by the other 6 viruses associated with ARDD. For CIV cases in the United States there is almost always a link to animal shelters, boarding kennels, or day care centers for dogs. The distinguishing feature, however, is the degree of morbidity within the facility. For most cases of ARDD, few dogs show signs because prior exposure and vaccination reduce the attack rate. For CIV, virtually all dogs are susceptible regardless of age, and attack rates of 60% to 80% are not unusual in group settings. The situation in South Korea with the H3N2 strain appears to be similar in that there was a high attack rate in dog farms and kennels, but low seroprevalence in companion animals.21, 22 Casual contact between dogs does not seem to be a high-risk factor, and this may relate to the relatively low amount of virus produced in dogs with CIV.",

The onset of clinical signs is usually rapid, with incubation periods in natural settings of 2 to 3 days being common. The detectable signs are somewhat related to the time from infection to the date of the examination. Common signs in most dogs are lethargy, anorexia, nasal discharge, sneezing, depression, ocular discharge, and cough, with coughing lasting up to 3 weeks postinfection. This range of clinical signs has been reproduced experimentally with both H3N8 CIV and the avian H3N2 virus.14, 20 Initially a nasal discharge may be clear, but it can quickly become mucopurulent. Many dogs show only a low-grade fever that may persist for 1 to 4 days. In uncomplicated cases a persistent, dry, and nonproductive cough develops, which may last for several weeks. Many dogs are diagnosed as having pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, or abnormal lung sounds. In natural settings, serious lung involvement is usually caused by the secondary bacteria, or mycoplasma infections that are enhanced with compromised lung defenses. In group settings, multiple viral pathogens may be circulating, which further complicates the identity of a causative agent (Dubovi, unpublished observation, 2009).26 The mortality rate directly as a result of influenza virus infections is difficult to determine, given the negative effect of other respiratory agents.",

In an experimental study using 3 CIV strains, Deshpande and colleagues14 showed that 2 of the 3 challenge strains gave higher shedding titers than the third virus, and 1 of the 3 strains induced more severe clinical signs. All challenge data for the avian-origin H3N2 have been done with the same virus, so no viral comparisons are available.20, 27 As one could expect with a respiratory pathogen, the early lesions in the upper respiratory tract are consistent with tracheitis and bronchitis with some extension to the bronchioles. There are areas of epithelial cell necrosis, loss of cuboidal glandular cells, and infiltration of the propria-submucosa by mixtures of inflammatory cells. As a result, the normal defense of the respiratory tract provided by the ciliated epithelial cells is severely compromised. The effect of the virus infection on the lower respiratory tract can be highly variable, and the lesions noted are more severe in the later stages of the infection. On day 3 postinfection, there were numerous petechial hemorrhages in most lobes of the lung.14 At later times in the infection, consolidated areas of the lung could be seen, which coincided with an increase in clinical signs. Histopathological lesions consisted of peribronchiolar and perivascular infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells (tracheobronchitis and bronchiolitis), diffuse thickening of alveolar septa by infiltrates of inflammatory cells, and infiltration of the alveoli by neutrophils and macrophages (alveolitis).14, 27, 28 The reported lesions were in animals that tested negative for other pathogens, which indicates that influenza virus alone is able to cause significant pathologic changes.",
