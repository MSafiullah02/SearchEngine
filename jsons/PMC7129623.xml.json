SARS was caused by a novel betacoronavirus that emerged in Guangdong, China in November 2002.9 It resulted in more than 8000 human infections and 774 deaths in 37 countries during 2002\u201303.10 At that time, SARS hit hard on the neighboring city of Hong Kong which resulted in 1755 confirmed cases including 300 fatal cases11 but no cases were identified in Macau. On the other hand, MERS, caused by a different kind of novel coronavirus, was first detected in Saudi Arabia in 201212 and was responsible for 2499 human infections and 861 fatalities since September 2012.13 When scientific evidence suggested that the virus responsible for the pneumonia-like disease spreading fast across China in December 2019 was closely related to SARS and MERS, any miscommunication could easily spark panic among the general public.",

All these preventative measures at the community pharmacies were exceptionally important for pharmacies visited not only by local residents but also tourists from around the world. Similarly, the personal and environmental practice by the public should be reinforced whenever possible and community pharmacists are well-positioned to do so more than any other health professionals.",

Community pharmacy is often one of the major retail outlet of such products and is expected to play the important role of ensuring the availability of such products in the pharmacy. Ever since the first diagnosis of 2019-CoV, the supply of various disinfection products, such as alcohol, alcohol hand rub, and disinfectant, has been tight. The over-reliance on importation exposed the public health to substantial vulnerability. Community pharmacists continued to seek new product sources but without success. On February 7, 2020, the local government stepped in and commissioned two local pharmaceutical manufacturers to produce disinfectant products.22 On reflection, instead of being less than proactive, community pharmacists could have taken steps to try to prepare alcohol-based handrub formulations. Some of them indicated the lack of knowledge and therefore lack of confidence to do so. The underlying problem was indeed the lack of knowledge about where to locate reliable instructions of preparing such formulations. A step-by-step guide for production of handrub formulations at pharmacy bench had been provided by the WHO23 and re-iterated in the Annex 4 of the FIP guideline.8 It is important for community pharmacists to get familiarized with the procedure and to ensure all the necessary reagents and devices are available in the pharmacy.",

This posed another vulnerability for the city as the supply of surgical mask totally relied on external sources. On this matter, community pharmacists in Macau were positioned to do three things: (1) help consumers differentiate surgical masks from other types of face masks not made for protection against virus transmission; (2) control the price of surgical masks within reasonable price range; and (3) help implement \u201cThe Guaranteed Mask Supply for Macao Residents Scheme\u201d in response to the new government policy.",

In addition, by selling the surgical masks within the reasonable price range, the community pharmacies set the reference price which could help counteract irrational pricing elsewhere.

After the first coronavirus case was confirmed in the city on January 22, 2020, the local government ordered 20 million masks and announced a controlled distribution through pharmacies.29 According to the scheme, each local resident and person on working visa could buy a maximum of 10 surgical masks every 10 days for only 8 patacas (US$1) at contracted pharmacies as long as they presented their valid identity card. Moreover, the government had set up a webpage with updates every 15 minutes of the number of surgical masks available at different pharmacies and their contact details for the convenience of the buyers.30 This scheme was feasible due to the preexisting partnership between the government and the participating pharmacies. Fifty-six of the 294 community pharmacies in Macau joined the public-private partnership and became the contracted pharmacies to share the dispensing duties and pharmaceutical care for patients from the public health institutes long before the outbreak. In order to monitor the pharmacy stock take of pharmaceutical products as required in the partnership agreement, an IT system was installed so that the data about the purchase and sales of those pharmaceutical products were collected during each transaction at the pharmacy and immediately submitted to the central data system in the government for real-time monitoring purposes. With this system already in place before the 2019-CoV outbreak, only minor adjustment was needed to include government-provided surgical masks on the monitoring list, and make such information publicly available on the official website. While the community pharmacies were the components of this \u201cThe Guaranteed Mask Supply for Macao Residents Scheme\u201d and the IT system being the infrastructure, it was really the data that ensured the connectivity of the system for it to run smoothly and serve the purpose. Community pharmacists, therefore, played the role of custodian in data availability and accuracy.",

Considering the possibility of human-to-human transmission and the continuous growth of outbreak, the high volume of travel from Wuhan was considered a major threat to the effectiveness of infection prevention and control. Reinforcement of health inspection and isolation efforts at various cross-boundary checkpoints, mandatory requirements for all travelers from Wuhan to declare their health status, and tighter border-control took place immediately. While these measures aimed to step up the respiratory-disease-surveillance system, the potential risks of carrying and transmitting the virus by the Wuhan travelers who were still staying in Macau could not be dismissed. Early detection and referral of suspected cases were crucial to prevent large-scale community transmission. As mentioned above, the early symptoms could be mild and non-specific,15\n,\n16 and community pharmacy could well be the first point of contact when the affected people sought basic medical aid for symptomatic relief. Community pharmacists, therefore, must be on full alert and be able to screen patients for any necessary referral.

They are charged with key responsibilities of informing, advising and educating the community, maintaining a stable supply of pharmaceuticals and personal hygiene products, and screening of suspected cases and making appropriate referral as required. As this or similar situations evolve, community pharmacists should remain engaged in the coordinated efforts and be readily adaptive to changes required in pharmacy practice. For pharmacists to assume a role in the health emergency preparedness and response arrangements at community level, public private partnership and the application of real-world data have been shown to be vital.",
