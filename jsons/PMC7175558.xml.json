            "text": "Influenza is a contagious respiratory disease that is widespread across the globe. Despite advances in medical technology, influenza causes considerable hospitalizations and mortality [1, 2]. It is estimated that each year, 1 billion cases of symptomatic influenza infection have occurred across the globe, including 3\u20135 million cases of severe illness and 290 000\u2013650 000 cases of influenza-related respiratory deaths [3]. From 2010 to 2018, approximately 4.3\u201323 million medical visits, 140 000\u2013960 000 hospitalizations, 18 000\u201396 000 influenza-related intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and 12 000\u201379 000 deaths were associated with influenza per year in the United States of America [4]. The disease burden of influenza in Asia is similar to that of western countries [5, 6]. Influenza infection also poses an economic burden. Recent estimates place the economic burden of a moderately severe to severe pandemic at approximately USD 500 billion, or 0.6% of the global income [7]. For these reasons, influenza epidemics are regarded as the greatest threat to the public health in the twenty-first century.",

Kilbourne suggested that the disease features caused by different influenza virus subtypes are clinically indistinguishable [8]. Several studies have examined the hypothesis that the severity of illness caused by influenza is associated with causal virus types. For example, Mosnier & Irving found that the clinical symptoms and outcomes for patients with influenza A and B infections were comparable [9, 10]. Studies by Kaji and colleagues showed that influenza A infection was more severe than influenza B [11]. The outcomes of different studies have been variable in terms of sample size, study settings, populations, and the ability to control potential confounders. Despite inconsistent findings, to understand the differences of the severity and outcomes between specific influenza virus types is of great significance to arrange rational diagnositic testings, carry out prompt antiviral treatment and make other clinical decisions in the management of severe influenza.",

Although the specific pathogenesis governing these effects has not been elucidated, some mechanisms have been postulated. Hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza B virus strains is heavily glycosylated [23]. Since glycosylated HA binds collagenous lectins in lung surfactants, it is easily cleared from the lungs. HA of human influenza B viruses also preferentially bind to \u03b1-2,6-linked sialic acids present in the human upper respiratory tract, whilst A (H1N1) pdm09 viruses bind both \u03b1-2,6-linked and \u03b1-2,3-linked sialic acids [24]. Influenza B viruses are therefore restricted to the upper respiratory tract, whilst A (H1N1) pdm09 viruses are more prevalent in the lower respiratory tract [25]. Compared to influenza A viruses, influenza B has lower receptor-binding affinity due to the presence of a Phe-95 versus a Tyr-98 in the HA protein, resulting in a loss of hydrogen bonds [26]. The innate IFN response is also more rapidly initiated following influenza B as opposed to influenza A virus infection. This leads to more rapid viral clearance and lower viral titers [27]. In vivo, both influenza A and B viruses downregulate the surface expression of major histocompatibility complex-I (MHC-I). A more pronounced reduction in surface MHC-I expression was observed in influenza B patients, leading to milder immunologic reactions, followed by significantly lower levels of inflammatory cytokines and lung tissue injury [28].",

Methods were taken to reduce selection bias and control confounders, but some limitations should be noted. First, due to the retrospective nature of the study, potential selection bias may have influenced the data. For example, during each influenza season, patients with influenza-like illness (such as fever, sore throat or cough) were assessed through influenza RNA tests by the subjective judgement of attending physicians in the five hospitals. It was possible that more severe (or milder) patients were tested for influenza. Not all respiratory cases were eligible for swabbing and some selection bias occurred. Secondly, due to the retrospective design, the impact of vaccination on disease severity could not be evaluated, and the inclusion of incomplete data may have lowered the accuracy of our results. Thirdly, there is evidence of different severities of influenza A virus subtypes [11, 32]. However, over 50% of patients were not tested for subtypes in our study. Further work is required to compare the clinical features according to subtype. Finally, our study population were immunocompetent, adolescent and adult hospitalized patients. The conclusions should be assessed prudently prior to similar assessments in immunocompromised patients, pediatrics and outpatients.",
