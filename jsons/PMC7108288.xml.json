            "text": "In the current scenario, CNTs are one of the forefronts in a diverse field of medicine, which are continuously being explored by researchers, scientists and academicians for the development of new, safe and effective nanomedicine. The CNTs are promising quasi one-dimensional nanomaterial with well ordered flat networks of fused benzene rings or hollow graphitic cylindrical tubular structure consisting of hexagonal arrangement with sp\n2 hybridized carbon atoms 1, 2, 3, 4. CNTs are mainly classified into four types, based upon the structure and diameters including single-, double-, triple-, and multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The length of the tubes can be extended depending on the type of production method 5, 6, 7, 8. CNTs are one of the attractive tools in nanotechnology with surface engineered carbon nanotubes (f-CNTs), emerging as a new family of carbon nanovectors that enabled numerous biomedical applications. Functionalization plays a pivotal role in the design of CNTs-based nanomaterials by rendering them more biocompatible and less toxic with increased dispersibility in comparison to pristine CNTs. The methodology of functionalization of CNTs can be classified broadly into two categories: (a) covalent attachment of active biochemical moieties through chemical reactions onto CNTs skeleton, and (b) non-covalent adsorption or wrapping of different functional molecules 7, 9. The various types of nanocomposites have been summarized in Fig. 1\n.",

In this TDDS, CNTs facilitated the electro-sensitive-transdermal drug delivery [14]. The advantages of CNTs in TDDS include high loading efficiency and enhanced transdermal penetration of drugs by application of a small electrical bias to create a programmable drug delivery system.

Till date only few numbers of reports are available on the applications of surface engineered CNTs in PDT. Photosensitizer [5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)] loaded PAMAM dendrimers modified MWCNTs (dMNTs) showed good biocompatibility with significant increase in the accumulation of 5-ALA in MGC-803 tumor cells leading to a potential photodynamic anti-tumor effect [25]. Chitosan wrapped Chlorine6 (Ce6), which is a photosensitizer, loaded SWCNTs revealed high cellular uptake (high anticancer effects) and low toxicity against HeLa cancer cells than free Ce6 [26].",

The SWCNTs have the ability to absorb 700\u20131100 nm NIR radiation and convert it into heat, which kills cancer cells [29]. Moon and co-workers demonstrated the photothermal effect of PEGylated SWCNTs upon NIR irradiation on KB tumor bearing nude mice and observed that sufficiently high thermal energy was generated from optically excited PEG-SWCNTs to destroy tumor in a non-invasive manner. The mice treated with PEG-SWCNTs and NIR irradiation showed the complete eradication of solid malignant tumor devoid of any toxicity or abnormal behavior 20 days post treatment. The issue concerned with residual SWCNTs accumulation inside the body after the treatment was resolved as nanotubes were excreted from mice's body in about 2 months through the biliary or urinary pathway in biodistribution study [27]. Hashida and co-workers reported the photothermal ablation activity of a novel SWCNTs-peptide composite with a designed peptide having a repeated structure of H-(-Lys-Phe-Lys-Ala-)7-OH[(KFKA)7] against tumor cells. The obtained results suggest the remarkable suppression of tumor growth compared with only SWCNT-(KFKA)7 injection alone or NIR irradiation alone [28].",

            "text": "Currently viral vector system based gene delivery is most widely used to achieve high efficiency of gene expression, which concerns the safety, as viral vector can be immunogenic, oncogenic, and may be responsible for inflammation. Further, gene therapy may suffer rapid degradation of exogenous nucleic acid. Now-a-days some effective multiple non-viral delivery systems like polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes, cell penetrating peptides, cationic lipids, dendrimers and f-CNTs are being employed to efficiently deliver nucleic acids including siRNA with reduced immunogenicity. The efficiency of gene expression mediated by these nanovectors is lower as compared with the viral vector but they provide the advantages of easy up-scaling, flexibility and reduced immunogenicity. The applications of CNTs as new vectors for delivery of nucleic acids is another area of research and development which could offer several advantages for nucleic acid, siRNA, gene and protein delivery owing to their thin and long architecture that offers a large surface area to which siRNA can be bound and delivered to target site. Further, CNTs may have protective capacity, which stabilize and lead to more efficient cellular transfection and prevent the lysosomal degradation of encapsulated nucleic acids [30]. Kawaguchi and co-workers synthesized DNA-functionalized SWCNTs to improve the dispersibility as compared to acid treated SWCNTs. The binding ratio of the acid-treated SWCNTs and DNA was calculated to be 3:1 (DNA/SWCNTs) from the phosphorous content in DNA-SWCNTs [31]. In context of the enhanced gene delivery Sanz and co-workers were first to develop and demonstrate the enhanced gene delivery using lysosomotropic anti-malarial drug chloroquine loaded polyethyleneimine (PEI)-coated DWCNTs to enhance the cell transfection efficiency [32].",

The authors found that the MWCNTs are highly echogenic in liver and heart as examined on pig as an experimental animal model.

Previous literature suggested non-biodegradable nature of CNTs and excretion through biliary pathway, especially via urine and feces. However, few investigations observed that CNTs are degraded in specific environments via natural, enzymatic catalysis, natural horseradish peroxidase (HRP) with low concentration of H2O2 (approximately 40 \u03bcM) at 4 \u00b0C over 12 weeks or in the presence of human neutrophil enzyme, myeloperoxidase. Importantly biodegraded nanotubes did not produce any inflammatory response when aspirated in to the lungs of mice 57, 58, 59. Bianco and co-workers investigated the biodegradation of SWCNTs and MWCNTs under different conditions and concluded that the oxidized MWCNTs were highly degrading in nature as compared to SWCNTs [59]. These few recent literature reports support the biodegradable nature of CNTs, otherwise previously, CNTs were considered non-biodegradable and excreted out as examined by electron microscopic studies. Additionally biocompatible nanotubes could be prepared via conjugation of phospholipids (PL) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains on to them, which may be a promising alternative candidate in biomedical applications 58, 59, 60.",

These surface engineered CNTs are considered promising nanomaterial for use in many biomedical applications, including biocompatible modules for the delivery of bioactives. In conclusion, before realizing the full potential of CNTs, it is very important to generate data on their safety, efficacy, and feasibility. Although the scientists are optimistic about the possible application of CNTs yet learning the lesson from past (like thalidomide tragedy), the safety and efficacy of CNTs/CNTs based products/devices etc. must be established beyond doubt. We have witnessed the emergence of several materials/devices/products, which could not make their way to market but then that's the research. Let's keep our fingers crossed and wait for the conclusive proof regarding the possible application of CNTs, particularly in biomedical arena.
