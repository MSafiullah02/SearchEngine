The burden of RSV disease in the community is substantial, though molecular epidemiology of transmission is not well-characterized.4, 5, 6, 7 In the United States, 41% of children attend childcare,8 which is a known risk factor for severe RSV disease, and likely serves as an important route of transmission to other attendees and family members.9, 10 The socioeconomic impact of illness associated with childcare attendance includes work days missed and parental stress.11 A 16-year longitudinal study of childcare attendees in the 1980s using culture techniques showed that RSV was the most frequent viral etiology of respiratory illness.2, 12\n",

Each child had a nasopharyngeal swab collected at symptom onset and weekly thereafter until symptom resolution. A daily symptom diary was completed by the caregiver for 10 days following symptom onset. From February 1, 2006 to May 1, 2006, nasopharyngeal samples were collected only with illness episodes.

A third cluster of seven RSV episodes was identified in room X3 during Season 1, consisting of two subtype A and five subtype B viruses.

These results highlight the significant clinical and socioeconomic impact of RSV in the community, and emphasize that the childcare setting is an important potential site of interventions to reduce the burden of RSV disease. Interventions that reduce RSV transmission in childcare, such as vaccines and enhanced infection control measures, are likely to have a substantial clinical and socioeconomic impact.",
