            "text": "Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is an invaluable technique used for imaging the ultrastructure of samples and it is particularly useful when determining virus-host interactions at a cellular level. The environment inside a TEM is not favorable for biological material (high vacuum and high energy electrons). Also biological samples have little or no intrinsic electron contrast, and rarely do they naturally exist in very thin sheets, as is required for optimum resolution in the TEM. To prepare these samples for imaging in the TEM therefore requires extensive processing which can alter the ultrastructure of the material. Here we describe a method which aims to minimize preparation artifacts by freezing the samples at high pressure to instantaneously preserve ultrastructural detail, then rapidly substituting the ice and infi ltrating with resin to provide a fi rm matrix which can be cut into thin sections for imaging. Thicker sections of this material can also be imaged and reconstructed into 3D volumes using electron tomography.",

            "text": "The method of preservation of samples for TEM can infl uence image interpretation so it is important to stabilize the sample with as little change from the in vivo state as possible. There are two main methods of stabilizing (fi xing) samples for TEM: chemical fi xation and cryo-fi xation. There are advantages and disadvantages to both. Chemical fi xation is the most common method and, although time consuming, is an easy, repeatable method that requires very little specialized equipment. Alternatively, cryofi xation methods seek to preserve samples in as near the in vivo state as possible by stabilizing instantaneously and reducing or eliminating the use of chemicals. Cryo-fi xation methods are preferable to chemical fi xation methods; however, they have signifi cant technical and fi nancial disadvantages.",

These protocols are relatively quick and easy to do. The main disadvantage of using chemical fi xation is that the introduction of toxic chemicals to the sample can have an unknown effect on ultrastructure. Fixative penetrates even soft biological material slowly which allows changes to occur within the sample before it is fully stabilized, for example redistribution and extraction of ions and soluble proteins [ 2 ] , extraction and rearrangement of phospholipids [ 3 ] , mismatch in osmotic conditions leading to organelle blooming and non-isotropic shrinkage [ 4 ] .",

            "text": "The only viable alternative to the deleterious effects of chemical fi xation and dehydration is to preserve samples by freezing the water present rapidly enough to prevent ice crystals forming. If samples are frozen quickly enough the water inside the sample is vitrifi ed and both soluble and non-soluble structures are held in a glass-like matrix (amorphous ice), stabilizing the sample instantaneously. Amorphous ice is non-destructive, but to achieve full vitrifi cation of cellular water very high cooling rates are required [ 5 ] . If these cooling rates are not reached, crystalline ice forms and solutes within the cell are trapped between the crystals forming a network of segregated compartments. When viewed in the microscope, this is known as ice segregation artifact and is particularly obvious in badly frozen nuclei where it appears as a \"cracking\" pattern ( Fig. 1 ). Once frozen, the sample may be stored in liquid nitrogen (\u2212196 \u00b0C) before further processing. The temperature cannot be allowed to climb above the re-vitrifi cation point of water (around \u2212140 \u00b0C) or ice crystals will form. The advantage of using freezing techniques to preserve samples is that they are stabilized instantaneously without the need for chemicals. However, the disadvantages are that at atmospheric pressure good freezing only occurs within a few microns of the surface at best, and the techniques involved are diffi cult and time-consuming requiring dedicated equipment.",

One of the greatest variations is the time that samples are kept in substitution medium prior to embedding. It is widely accepted that leaving samples in fi xative and/or solvents during room temperature chemical fi xation can rearrange cell components, especially lipids [ 3 ] , and extract soluble cytoplasmic contents [ 2 ] . At low temperatures this process slows but does not stop. Therefore, there has to be a balance between suffi cient time in substitution media for full replacement of water, and prolonged substitution leading to extraction of cell components. Dedicated freeze substitution units are available which fi nely control the temperature changes required during substitution, and in some cases can be programmed to control the addition of solvents. These units are expensive to purchase; however, recently a protocol has been developed which negates the need for dedicated freeze substitution units [ 13 ] .",
