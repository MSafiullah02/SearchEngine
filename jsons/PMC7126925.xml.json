            "text": "Diagnostic electron microscopy (EM) can contribute decisively to the laboratory diagnosis of infectious diseases and will be of particular importance if a rapid diagnosis is required, as in a potential bioterror scenario or if emerging infectious agents are to be characterized (O\u2019Toole, 1999, Hazelton and Gelderblom, 2003, Madeley, 2003, Miller, 2003, Ng et al., 2003, Goldsmith et al., 2004, Morens et al., 2004). Likewise EM should be applied in critical clinical setting of controversial or urgent pathological cases (Kamondi et al., 2000, Nordhausen and Barr, 2001, Turbat-Herrera et al., 2004). In many instances, in infectious diseases a rapid and accurate diagnosis is achieved after negative staining of virus or bacterial suspensions (Madeley and Field, 1988, Biel and Madeley, 2001, Gelderblom, 2001, Gelderblom, 2003, Gentile and Gelderblom, 2005; Robert Koch Institute\nhttp://www.rki.de). However, in other cases, if infected cell cultures or tissues (e.g., biopsies taken to complement material for the negative staining approach) have to be examined, the need for rapid embedding methods enabling a same-day diagnosis from ultrathin sections is evident. In the past a number of simplified tissue embedding procedures using reduced dehydration times and increased polymerization temperatures were proposed (Bencosme and Tsutsumi, 1970, Johannessen, 1973, Doane et al., 1974, Rowden and Lewis, 1974, Miller, 1982, Bozzola and Russell, 1992).",

            "text": "Rapid diagnostic EM could probably benefit from the microwave employment, a technology that has been successfully applied in organic chemistry (De la Hoz et al., 2005), industrial food processing (Vaid and Bishop, 1998), sterilization of hospital waste (Celandroni et al., 2004), and also in the clinical laboratory. Here a great number of microwave accelerated procedures for light microscopy and EM tissue processing, staining reactions, and immunolabelling was developed (Mayers, 1970, Leong et al., 1985, Login and Dvorak, 1988, Login and Dvorak, 1994, Kok and Boon, 1990, Kok and Boon, 2003, Shi et al., 1991, Leong and Sormunen, 1998, Cavusoglu et al., 2001, Giberson and Demaree, 2001, Giberson et al., 2003, Leria et al., 2004, Munoz et al., 2004), all of them resulting in a significant time reduction. The effect of microwave irradiation on polar substances is mainly well understood. It is attributed to dielectric heating, also called \u201cthermal effect\u201d (Leonard and Shepardson, 1994, Giberson and Demaree, 1995, Kok and Boon, 2003) causing a temperature rise in the whole sample (\u201cinternal heating\u201d; in contrast to conventional heating which starts at the specimen surface). The existence of an additional \u201cnon-thermal\u201d effect of microwave energy (Marani and Feirabend, 1993, De la Hoz et al., 2005), which may be particularly effective in biological hydrated material in influencing the fixation of cells (Ruijgrok et al., 1993, Leria et al., 2004, Wendt et al., 2004), is still unproven.",

A non-contact infra-red temperature sensor measures the current solution temperature in the vial, while a magnetic stirrer is ensuring uniform heat distribution in the vial solution. The solution temperature is the critical parameter to monitor the magnetron wattage (maximum 700 W) power output, which is controlled via a feedback loop during the continuous microwave irradiation of the sample. The graphical display of the slope of temperature rise, irradiation temperature stabilization and time for each processing step, could be easily defined on a dedicated touch screen monitor. The whole microwave-assisted processing is controlled by a microprocessor and dedicated software package. This software also allows routine documentation of the entire microwave process for Quality Assurance and Quality Control.",

Despite the complex aspects influencing the aldehyde fixation process of tissues (Fox et al., 1985, Leong and Sormunen, 1998, Izumi et al., 2000, Werner et al., 2000, Giberson and Elliott, 2001), recent observations tend to support the existence of the direct mechanism of microwave energy action (Kok and Boon, 2003, Leria et al., 2004, Wendt et al., 2004, De la Hoz et al., 2005, Gaber et al., 2005). This needs to be considered in the microwave-assisted tissue processing because also our results suggest, that an \u201coverheating\u201d inside the solid tissue samples can adversely affect tissue ultrastructure. Therefore, further development work should include efforts to reduce the critical \u201cthermal\u201d effect and increase direct \u201cnon-thermal\u201d microwave action during tissue fixation (Galvez et al., 2004, Leria et al., 2004).",

We observed that this shared equipment is a great benefit for the EM laboratory, e.g., a sample received late afternoon can be rapidly fixed in the microwave (e.g., 10\u201320 min in place of at least 2 h at room temperature) and added (without basket change) to other tissues which are to be processed automatically in the LYNX overnight anyway, and if urgent, rapidly polymerized in the microwave in 1 h 45 min the next morning (instead of 48 h). This option generates more flexibility of the laboratory workflow in handling clinical urgent samples and improves the economic employment of the available manpower. Thus, a \u201csame-day\u201d electron microscopy diagnosis for cells and tissues becomes reality.",

As judged from sectioning properties and section quality, the samples were uniformly polymerized, i.e., comparable to the results with the longer microwave protocol. The observed denser appearance of cell cytoplasm could be explained by less extraction of cell material during the shorter course of the complete procedure. Therefore, in view of the acceptable results with the approximately 3.5 h protocol, attempts to cut down further the preparation schedule appear worthwhile.",

The microwave-assisted sample preparation enables EM to evaluate also thin sections for rapid diagnosis. Basing on our experience, the subsequent section ultramicrotomy, staining and examination in the EM can be completed in about 2 h. In consequence, using the potential of accelerated section preparation, EM-diagnosis from biopsy material can be rendered on the same workday. Thus, both negative staining of small particulate suspensions \u2013 from the smallest viruses up to bacteria, spores and parasites \u2013 as well as tissues and diagnostic cell cultures can be scrutinized by the \u201copen view\u201d of EM (Hazelton and Gelderblom, 2003) as part of the \u201cfrontline\u201d diagnostic methods guiding further measures, e.g., containment and therapeutic activities. In combination with digital image acquisition and telemicroscopy networking tools (Schroeder et al., 2001) crucial or interesting findings could be consulted or shared worldwide in very short time.",
