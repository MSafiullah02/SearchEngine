Current gold standard diagnostic assays are hampered by supply shortages in critical reagents including nasal swabs, RNA extraction kits, personal protective equipment (PPE), instrumentation, and labor. Here we present an approach to overcome these challenges with the development of a rapid colorimetric assay using reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) optimized on human saliva samples without an RNA purification step. We describe our optimizations of the LAMP reaction and saliva pre-treatment protocols that enabled rapid and sensitive detection of < 10 2 viral genomes per reaction in contrived saliva controls. We also observed high performance of this assay on a limited number of clinical saliva samples. While thorough validation on additional clinical samples will be needed before such an assay can be widely used, these preliminary results demonstrate a promising approach to overcome the current bottlenecks limiting widespread testing.",

The current gold standard test measures viral nucleic acids extracted from clinical swabs by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). This assay requires trained medical personnel, specialized instrumentation, supply-limited reagents, and significant technical labor. Isothermal nucleic acid amplification tests are an alternative to conventional PCR methods that do not require expensive instruments or trained personnel to perform the reaction or quantify the results. Specifically, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) with simultaneous reverse-transcription (RT-LAMP) allows for rapid and sensitive detection of nucleic acids within one hour in an easily interpretable colorimetric assay that requires only a heat source 1,2 .",

The robustness of the LAMP Bst polymerase to PCR inhibitors makes it especially well-suited and widely used for pathogen detection in unpurified samples 8 . This confers a major potential advantage over current testing protocols as it enables skipping the cost-, labor-, and reagent-consuming step of RNA extraction.",

Across both sets of LAMP primers, and for both RNA and particles, saliva strongly inhibited LAMP detection of SARS-CoV-2 compared to water (Fig. 1B) . Particles were weakly and inconsistently detected in saliva whereas their detection in water was on par with detection of RNA (Fig. 1C) . This suggests the presence of an inhibitor in saliva rather than an inaccessibility of particle-associated RNA. We observed time sensitivity of the colorimetric assay especially from saliva, with many samples tinting yellow after prolonged incubation in the LAMP reaction (longer than 40 minutes). We found that a 30-minute incubation provided a more reliable readout. Values indicate number of viral genome equivalents per reaction. Purple-framed boxes indicate 30-minute reactions.

We tested simple dilution of particle-containing saliva into water, and various heat and chemical treatments. First, we found that dilution of saliva into water enabled sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 particles using LAMP (Figure 2A , top). A heat treatment of 55\u02daC for 15 minutes followed by 98\u02daC for 5 minutes further improved LAMP sensitivity ( Fig. 2A, middle) . Identical heating steps plus the addition of proteinase K increased LAMP sensitivity relative to dilution alone ( Fig. 2A, bottom) but not markedly more than heat treatment. Importantly, we found that the combined heating steps above or proteinase K treatment improved SARS-CoV-2 particle detection in undiluted human saliva samples (Fig. 2B) and conferred a consistent Limit of Detection on the order of 10 2 particles per reaction. We experimented with additional heat and chemical pretreatments including the HUDSON protocol (heating unextracted diagnostic samples to obliterate nucleases) 14 and various detergents, but all of these conditions decreased assay sensitivity or interfered with colorimetry (Supplementary Figure 2A -C). We also varied the amount of crude sample input to the LAMP reaction. We found that adding up to 8 \u00b5L of direct saliva was compatible with the assay but increased volume did not improve sensitivity (Supp. Fig. 2D ). Figure 2 : Dilution, heat, and Proteinase K treatments improve SARS-CoV-2 detection from saliva. A) Dilution of particle-containing saliva into water improved LAMP detection by at least two orders of magnitude from undetectable to ~10 3 particles per reaction. Heat treatment and heat treatment plus proteinase K further increased LAMP sensitivity to ~10 2 viral genome equivalents per reaction (p < 0.1, one-sided t-tests compared to dilution alone). *Replicate 3 used Lamb et al. primers but gave nearly identical results to NEB Gene N-A primers.

We sought to avoid the 98 \u02daC heating step to make the saliva pre-treatment compatible with a single isothermal heat source. Whereas a mild heat treatment consisting of 50 \u02daC for 5 minutes and 64\u02da for 5 minutes did not enable sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 in undiluted saliva (Sup. Figure 2B) , a 64\u02da C treatment for 15 minutes of saliva that had been diluted 1:1 in either TE (10 mM Tris, 0.1 mM EDTA) or dilute HUDSON buffer (2.5 mM TCEP, 0.5 mM EDTA) improved detection (Sup. Fig. 4B ). Addition of RNAsecure, a non-enzymatic ribonuclease inhibitor that does not require heat-inactivation, boosted assay sensitivity to 10 2 viral particles per reaction (Sup. Fig  4B) . SARS-CoV-2 in samples treated with a thermolabile version of proteinase K (inactivated by incubation at 65\u02da for 10 minutes) was not detected in a sensitive fashion (Sup. Fig 4C) . Finally, we found that guanidine hydrochloride (40 mM) was compatible with the LAMP reaction and that both RNAsecure and primer multiplexing provided further enhancements to sensitivity (Sup. 4D). These pretreatment methods will enable the use of saliva in LAMP reactions using a single heat step, simplifying point-of-care testing.",

Here, we have demonstrated a variety of saliva pre-treatment protocols that enable sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 by both RT-LAMP and qRT-PCR. RNA in saliva likely comprises a mixture of free and particle-associated RNA. Capsid release of RNA and nuclease inactivation by heat or chemicals may damage free viral RNA, so a careful balance must be achieved to maximize sensitivity. Despite requiring brief inactivation at 98\u02daC, proteinase K treatment to release viral RNA and inactivate ribonucleases and other inhibitors in saliva worked well to increase sensitivity in both RT-LAMP and qRT-PCR. Alternatively, TE buffer, guanidine, HUDSON buffer, and RNAsecure allowed us to perform a heat step isothermal with the LAMP reaction conditions while maintaining high assay sensitivity. This version of the protocol is compatible with point-of-care testing. Our proof-ofconcept validation on actual clinical samples suggests high sensitivity of the current assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 directly from treated saliva. Further optimizations may improve assay sensitivity and robustness.",

The reader software returns endpoint absorbance for 430 nM and 560 nM wavelengths that measure positive and negative reaction results, respectively. Analytically, the ratio of 430 nM to 560 nM is computed for the pre-and post-read scans. For each well, the pre-read ratio is subtracted from the post-read ratio to establish a background subtracted value. The mean and standard deviation of the background subtracted negative controls (saliva + PBS) were computed from 12 wells across the plate. For each replicate, an adjusted absorbance ratio is computed by taking the ratio of each sample to the average negative control value (background subtracted sample ratio / background subtracted negative control ratio).",
