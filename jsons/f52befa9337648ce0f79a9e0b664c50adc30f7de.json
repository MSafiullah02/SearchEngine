Besides their visible attractiveness they have been of large economical importance. For this reason agricultural sciences traditionally flourished in The Netherlands. This included microbiology (or better bacteriology) to study and prevent contagious infections in plants. It was this setting that led Martinus Willem Beijerinck in 1898 to discover that a prevalent mosaic disease of tobacco, which was at that time an important crop, was caused by a filterable agent, that he called 'contagium vivum fluidum'. He coined the term 'virus' for this agent, that now is known as tobacco mosaic virus [1] . This was the start of the virology research tradition in The Netherlands. Up to today, virology is still a main research area in the biological sciences. The fundamental branch of Dutch gene therapy research was born out of this virology field. Progressions made by gene therapy scientists in The Netherlands have had a significant impact on the translation of gene therapy into the clinic both at a national and international level. The expertise of Dutch gene therapy scientists is also recognized at an international level, as demonstrated by the fact that various Dutch research groups participate in several of the pre-clinical and clinical-oriented European gene therapy projects supported by the Framework Programmes of the European Union (Table 1) . This paper presents a brief overview on some milestones in Dutch basic gene therapy research as well as on past, present and future clinical gene therapy trials in The Netherlands.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 659, "end": 662, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1411, "end": 1420, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Basic gene therapy research was initiated in the lab of Alex van der Eb, who chose adenoviruses as a research model in the mid-1960s. Adenoviruses were first identified by Rowe and colleagues in 1953 when they tried to establish cell lines from adenoidal tissue and tonsils [2] . A transmissible agent was found responsible for degeneration of the cultures. More than 50 serotypes of human adenoviruses (HAdV) have been described to date, which have been classified in six 'species', A through F (formerly called 'subgroups'). The evolution and classification of adenoviruses has recently been reviewed [3] . Adenoviruses attracted much attention with the discovery by Trentin et al. [4] and Huebner et al. [5] that certain serotypes (i.e. serotypes 12 and 18 of species A) can induce tumors in newborn hamsters, whereas others (i.e. serotypes 2 and 5 of species C) are not or only very weakly oncogenic. These observations triggered Van der Eb in Leiden to use adenoviruses as a model for animal studies on cellular transformation in vitro and tumor induction in vivo. This led to the observation that the difference in oncogenicity correlates with the capacity of serotype-12, but not serotype-5, to down-regulate antigen presentation by MHC class I [6, 7] . This illustrated how important the immune system is for preventing tumor growth.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 274, "end": 277, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 603, "end": 606, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 684, "end": 687, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 707, "end": 710, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1252, "end": 1255, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1256, "end": 1258, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Adenoviral vectors"}, {"text": "As such, adenoviruses have played an important role in fundamental biomedical research.

This technique was used by Frank Graham in Alex van der Eb's lab to show that human cells, too, can be transformed and immortalized with naked adenovirus DNA. This is exemplified by the '293' cell line obtained after transformation of embryonal kidney cells with sheared adenovirus serotype-5 DNA [10] . Later, the Leiden group generated the '911' cell line, by transfer of plasmids carrying defined adenovirus type 5 sequences into human embryonal retinoblasts [11] . The observation that such adenovirus-transformed cells can be used for propagating viruses with defects in their Early Region 1 (E1) gene [12] facilitated the development and use of replication-defective adenovirus vectors.

This is the result of recombination between homologous sequences integrated in the helper cells and in the vector backbone [13] . In an attempt to solve the problem the Leiden group, in collaboration with scientists at Introgene (now Crucell), generated the PER.C6 cell line [14] . This line was established after transfer of a minimal portion of the adenovirus serotype 5 genome (bp 457-3510) into human embryonal retinoblasts, again using the calcium technique. In the process GLP conditions were used and the cell line, and the vectors produced on it, were extensively characterized [14, 15] .

He embraced the retroviral vector technology and eventually used these vectors to transfer the ADA cDNA into hematopoietic stem cells of three ADA patients in a study performed with French and British scientists [19] . This represented the first study in which hematopoietic stem cells of ADA patients were modified. In addition, Valerio founded the company IntroGene, now called Crucell.

The commonality of the integration sites pointed to the association of the nearby genes with the induction of the leukemic state. Berns' analyses of common integration sites led to the identification of several genes that can be involved in leukaemia. The use of MLV infection in transgenic animals further delineated the pathways in virus-induced leukaemia [23, 24] . The relevance of these observations to gene therapy became all too apparent with the development of leukaemia in four infants born with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) gene who were successfully treated with an infusion of autologous hematopoietic stem cells transduced with a defective retroviral vector [25] .

Transductional targeting is studied by Van Beusechem and collaborators, who replaced the adenovirus fiber with sequences of the spike protein of a reovirus [26] , and by Hoeben and collaborators who developed the adenovirus minor capsid protein IX as an anchor for targeting ligands [27] . Transcriptional targeting of the vectors to glioblastoma cells is employed by Sillevis Smitt and collaborators [28] , to cholangiocarcinoma cells in Bosma's group [29] , and to prostate cancer cells by Kraaij and collaborators [30] . Optimized delivery methods and enhanced-efficiency vectors are being evaluated in cell culture, spheroid cell aggregates [31] , tumor explants [32] , tissue slices [33] , and in small-animal models [34] . These approaches are not limited to adenovirus vectors. Also RNA viruses such as reoviruses, alphaviruses and coronaviruses are being evaluated for use as in anticancer strategies. Kranenburg and collaborators linked the capacity of reovirus to induce tumor-cell-specific cell death to the propensity of reovirus to sensitize ras-transformed cells to apoptosis [35] . Wilschut pioneered the use of alphaviruses and used these for eradication of pre-established tumors in an immunization protocol [36] . In a collaborative project Rottier's and Gerritsen's groups redirected the mouse hepatitis coronavirus to human tumor cells using a monoclonal-antibody dependent targeting strategy.

In this trial, interface tissue around the implant is destroyed by suicide gene therapy prior to fixation of the prosthesis with cement. Ongoing and upcoming clinical trials now focus on the translation of new developments in gene therapy research aimed at improvement of efficacy and safety of this treatment modality. The first Dutch trials on oncolytic adenovirus therapy for cancer will be carried out in Amsterdam and Rotterdam (Table 4) . Furthermore, the restoration of genetic defects other than SCID is addressed, including genetic lipoprotein lipase deficiency, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Leber congenital amaurosis causing blindness and Crigler Najjar syndrome causing irreversible brain damage due to hyperbilirubinemia (Tables 3 and 4 ).

The programme aims to improve the translation of pre-clinical gene therapy research to the clinic (www.zonmw.nl/genetherapy). So far, 11 phase I/II trials described in Tables 3  and 4 have been supported by this programme. ZonMw stimulates the cooperation of researchers and commercial enterprises. Besides investigator-initiated clinical studies, commercial interest in clinical gene therapy in The Netherlands is increasing.
