However, nonhepatotropic viruses only cause acute hepatitis and/or acute liver failure, without causing any chronic damage to the liver. These viruses do not primarily target the liver; hence the term non-hepatotropic is used in their description. These viruses include the herpesviruses (Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus [CMV] , and herpes simplex virus), parvovirus, adenovirus, infl uenza, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus [ 1 ] . The risk of acquiring infection from any of the non-hepatotropic viruses is specifi c to each virus and is detailed below. Considerations for determining the risk of infection include sanitary conditions, prior exposure, host immune status, and duration of infection in the contact.",

What is the management of patients who develop acute liver failure due to nonhepatotropic virus infection? Acute liver failure is defi ned by elevation in liver enzymes, an INR >1.5, and development of encephalopathy in someone without known underlying liver disease. It is associated with rapid progression and very high mortality. The fi rst step towards appropriate management is prompt transfer of the patient to the nearest transplant center. These patients are preferably admitted to the critical care unit, and should have close frequent monitoring of sensorium and the basic chemistry panel. Their management is very similar to management of other patients with non-acetaminophen-associated liver failure and the use of Nacetylcysteine may also have a role [ 15 ] .",

Do the non-hepatotropic viruses cause chronic disease or result in an elevated risk of liver cancer? None of the non-hepatotropic viruses, with the possible exception of PV-B19, has been shown to cause chronic liver disease. PV-B19 has been postulated as a rare and unusual etiology of chronic hepatitis. This observation is based on identifi cation of viral DNA from the hepatocytes years after the original infection. However, the extent to which it results in actual fi brosis and chronic damage is unclear. Furthermore, interest has focused on a possible effect of co-infection with PV-B19 on the natural history of chronic hepatitis B and C [ 18 ] . Similarly, none of the above viruses have been associated with liver cancer.",
