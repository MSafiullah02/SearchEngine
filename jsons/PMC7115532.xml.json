The causative agent of SARS was identified as a novel coronavirus, named as SARS-CoV [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. SARS-CoV is phylogenetically different from other members of the coronaviridae family and is the only coronavirus currently known to cause severe morbidity and mortality in humans [6], [7]. Although the SARS epidemic was successfully contained in July 2003, the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV remains poorly understood and there is no effective treatment for SARS currently. Prevention through contact-reduction or transmission-blocking measures has been the important means available to modify the devastating impact of this illness. Prevention through vaccination would be an attractive alternative that is less reliant on individual case detection to be effective.",

The N protein in many coronaviruses is highly immunogenic and abundantly expressed during infection [9], [10], [11], [12]. N protein of the feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) has been used as subunit vaccines to induce protective immunity and to prevent the progression of diseases in a cat model [13]. In porcine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), the N protein is a representative antigen for the T cell response and may induce both cellular and humoral immune response [14]. These results indicate that a good N protein vaccine candidate should elicit strong immune responses. The SARS-CoV N protein is highly conserved (99%) within different isolates, and shares 20\u201330% amino acid homology with the N proteins of other coronaviruses [7]. Thus, the N protein is an important target for SARS-CoV vaccine development.",

Antibodies against the N protein are longer lived and occur in greater abundance in SARS patients than antibodies against other viral components such as the S, M and E proteins [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]. In previous study, N protein is a representative antigen for the T cell response in vaccine setting [22], and the mice vaccinated with calreticulin (CRT)/N DNA were capable of significantly reducing the titer of challenging vaccinia virus expressing the N protein of SARS virus [23]. It has been reported that N DNA vaccine could induce SARS-specific T cell proliferation and cytotoxic T cells activity, further experiments demonstrate that SARS-N administration could induce virus-specific cellular responses in human cells using SCID-PBL/humouse model [24], [25]. Therefore, based on these observations, we initially focused on the SARS-CoV N protein as the target antigen for our DNA vaccine development.",

Several routes and methods of DNA immunization have been shown to generate Ab, Th cells, and CTL responses. Apart from the conventional intramuscular immunization, recent experiments have demonstrated that electroporation can greatly enhance plasmid vaccination, and is associated with increased levels of gene expression. Additionally, electroporation displays an adjuvant quality to increased gene expression [28], [29]. Another convenient DNA vaccine delivery system is oral vaccination using live-attenuated Salmonella typhimurium\n[30], [31]. The use of attenuated strains of Salmonella as vehicles to deliver plasmid DNA in vivo is an effective method to induce strong cell-mediated and humoral immune responses at mucosal sites [31], [32], [33], [34], [35].",

Mice administrated by electroporation induced the highest antibody response (predominant IgG1) among the three immunization groups and a mid-level of cellular response. In contrast, the same DNA vaccine, when delivered orally with live-attenuated Salmonella, evoked vigorous T cell response, but a weak antibody production dominated by the IgG2a subclass. There results showed that the different vaccination routes generated the distinct types of immune responses. The antibody subclass and T cell responses style (IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4) did not change with further DNA immunizations by the same or the alternate doses of DNA used in the immune groups (data not shown). These indicate that the ability to generate different Th types was not due to differences in the doses of DNA used in DNA immunization. These findings have important implications for vaccine design and studies of the mechanism of Th cell differentiation.",

            "text": "DNA vaccines have attracting increased attention due to multiple advantages over conventional vaccines. Attempts to improve the vaccines immune effects focus on enhancing DNA delivery and employing novel immunoadjuvants [29], [31], [37]. Electroporation has emerged as an effective method for delivering DNA vaccines, significantly enhancing immune responses. Previously, some experiments have shown that electroporation improved the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines in mice, guinea pigs, rabbits, and rhesus macaques [39], [40], [41]. In this study, we observed the antigen-specific antibody level induced by electroporation vaccination was higher than that have been seen in other two DNA vaccination studies. This phenomenon could be explained as following: firstly, the application of short electrical pulses to the target tissue, renders the cell membrane transiently permeable to DNA and other molecules. Secondly, the muscle could be damage at the site where the electroporation took place. Although the damage observed is minor since very little of the muscle mass is affected, the damaged cells in electroporation will release of \u201cdanger signals\u201d and attract antigen-presenting cells and other immune cells, which resulted in increased DNA uptake, leading to enhanced protein expression in treated muscle cells. Hence, the electroporation may work as an adjuvant to increase the immune response against the Ag produced.",

In the present study, we have also shown that a strong T cell proliferation response was associated with the administration of live-attenuated S. typhimurium containing the DNA vaccine. This strong T cell response was further supported by the detection of a high level of IFN-\u03b3, a Th1-associated cytokine, in the supernatant of the splenocyte cultures derived from oral immunized mice. On the other hand, the antibody response induced by live-attenuated S. typhimurium carrying the DNA vaccine is relatively weak, but predominantly IgG2a. This is in contrast to the strong IgG response associated DNA vaccination by electroporation. Salmonella has the ability to accumulate where the immune response takes action (lymphatic nodes and spleen). Attenuated Salmonella cells can be effectively consumed by peripheral phagocyte cells, penetrate through the mucosa M-cells and migrate towards inductive sites of lymphoid organs tuning up the immune response [31], [34], [44]. Most of the N peptides might be cleaved within the M cells, and presented through the MHC Class I pathway, giving rise to a strong cellular response. At the same time, a small amount of N peptides generated in the M cells might be secreted and presented by B cells through the MHC Class II pathway, resulting in a poor antibody response.",

In addition, based on our observation that oral DNA vaccination induced a strong T cell-mediated immune response, whereas electroporation immunizations induced moderate T cell but vigorous antibody responses, further studies should be carried out using a combination strategy of both oral and electroporation immunizations, to stimulate higher cellular and humoral immune responses.",
