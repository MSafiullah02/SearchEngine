However, as few as 1 in 10 patients with chest pain actually have a diagnosis of myocardial infarction, with the majority presenting due to alternative diagnoses. Therefore, the safe and early rule out of myocardial infarction may be helpful by facilitating a refocused clinical evaluation, with targeted investigations for alternative differential diagnoses. This can also provide confidence that patients with typical anginal symptoms have not had myocardial infarction and may be safely triaged for outpatient investigation.",

There are now several high-sensitivity assays available for use, all of which offer a magnitude improvement in performance over the previous generation. A number of diagnostic algorithms have been written which exploit the performance of these assays for detection of cardiac troponin at low concentration. For example, in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome with a nonischaemic ECG and a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I or T concentration <5 ng/L (measured using the Abbott ARCHI-TECT or Siemens Atelleca hs-cTnI, or the Roche Elecsys hs-cTnT assays), both negative predictive value and sensitivity are extremely high, missing as few as 1 in every 200 patients tested and stratifying between 30% and 50% of patients as low risk. [2] [3] [4] The High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin on Presentation to Rule-Out Myocardial Infarction (HiSTORIC) trial evaluated this approach in a stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial, reporting at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Congress in 2019, demonstrating implementation of an early rule-out pathway for myocardial infarction reduced length of stay and hospital admission without increasing adverse cardiac events.",

In this pathway, patients without ischaemia on the ECG are stratified based on their presentation and 1 hour troponin concentrations using assayspecific thresholds. In patients with very low troponin concentrations below the 'rule-out' threshold with at least 3 hours of symptoms, myocardial infarction is immediately ruled out on a single test. In those with troponin concentrations above a predefined 'rule-in' threshold, the likelihood of myocardial infarction is high, and patients are admitted for investigation and treatment. In all others, repeat troponin testing is performed at 1 hour after the initial sample to detect small but important rises in cardiac troponin concentration. If on serial testing the rule-in or rule-out thresholds are not reached, patients are observed for myocardial ischaemia and should undergo peak troponin testing to guide decision making.",

The authors conducted a systematic review and included only prospective cohort studies in patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected acute coronary syndrome, where high-sensitivity cardiac troponin concentrations were measured using a commercially available assay, and the diagnosis of myocardial infarction was adjudicated according to the Universal Definition. The prevalence of myocardial infarction varied from 2% (Parkland, USA) to 32% (Beijing, China). Where multiple publications emerged from the same cohorts, the authors included the As with all meta-analyses there are some limitations. First, studies did not use identical criteria for recruitment, with some cohorts excluding patients with missing 1 hour samples, or those with comorbidity such as end-stage renal failure. Second, some cohorts evaluated the ESC 0/1 hour algorithm against an outcome including a diagnosis of type 2 myocardial infarction. Type 2 myocardial infarction occurs in the context of another acute illness where there is myocardial oxygen supply or demand imbalance. These patients are by definition unwell and require hospitalisation for assessment and treatment, and in clinical practice are not considered for discharge. Pathways such as the ESC algorithm were not intended for this purpose. Third, the authors did not have access to individual patient-level data, and while the ESC guidelines state this algorithm should only be applied in patients without myocardial ischaemia on the ECG, all cohorts did not necessarily apply these criteria, and this may have adversely affected performance. Fourth, the authors included patients within the original ESC 0/1 hour algorithm derivation cohorts in some analyses. They attempted to mitigate for this by conducting a sensitivity analysis with these cohorts excluded, and diagnostic performance was similar to overall estimates. Finally, all patients included in this meta-analysis were recruited as part of observational cohort studies, where management was not guided by the ESC 0/1 hour algorithm, and individual management decisions may have influenced patient outcomes.",

They demonstrated an increased rate of discharge from the emergency department with the 0/1 hour algorithm (45.1% vs 32.3%, p<0.001) and a reduced length of stay (4.6, IQR (3.4-6.4) hours vs 5.6 (4.0-7.1) hours, p<0.001).

Similar findings were observed in a non-randomised, prospective international multicentre implementation study by Twerenbold et al. 7 In 2296 patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, the ESC 0/1 hour algorithm was followed in 94% of cases, with a median length of stay 2.5 (2.3-4.0) hours.
