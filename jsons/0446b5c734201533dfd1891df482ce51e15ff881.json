            "text": "Purpose: Chronic pain is common in adolescents. Evidence-based guidelines recommend interdisciplinary treatment, but access is limited by geography. The development of hybrid programs utilizing both face-to-face and videoconference treatment may help overcome this. We developed a 7-week hybrid pediatric interdisciplinary pain program (Hybrid-PIPP) and wished to compare it to individual face-to-face sessions (Standard Care). Our objective was to test the feasibility of a protocol that used a matched pair un-blinded randomized controlled design to investigate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the Hybrid-PIPP compared to Standard Care. Patients and Methods: Parent-adolescent dyads were recruited from tertiary pediatric clinics and matched by disability before randomization to minimize allocation bias. The adolescents (aged 11-17) had experienced primary pain for >3 months. Hybrid-PIPP involved 11 hrs of group therapy and 4 individual videoconference sessions. Standard care was provided by the same clinical team, using the same treatment model and similar intensity as the Hybrid-PIPP. The intention was to recruit participants for 3 Hybrid-PIPP groups with a comparison stream. Recruitment was ceased after 2 groups due to the high participant disability requiring more intensive intervention. Results: Eighteen dyads were screened and 13 randomized (7 Hybrid-PIPP, 6 Standard Care, 2 unsuitable, 3 unallocated when the study was stopped). The study met a priori feasibility criteria for staff availability; recruitment rate; treatment completion; and data collection. Global satisfaction ratings were similar in both streams (SC median 7, range 5-9 and Hybrid-PIPP median 8.5, range 5-10). Challenges were identified in both streams. A future modified Hybrid-PIPP was considered acceptable if the intensity is increased to manage the high level of disability. Standard care was considered inefficient. No adverse events were reported. Conclusion: The study determined that the protocol met a priori feasibility criteria, but to be practicable in a real world, health environment requires significant modifications.

            "text": "Chronic pain is a significant issue for children and adolescents with a prevalence rate of between 11% and 38%. 1 Common presentations include widespread pain, and pain localized to the abdomen, back, head, and musculoskeletal system. 1 Left untreated, chronic pain can have a significant impact on a young person's life trajectory, affecting their physical and mental health into adult life. [2] [3] [4] Evidence-based guidelines recommend an interdisciplinary approach to treatment using programs that incorporate cognitive behavioral therapy into functional restoration programs. 5 This interdisciplinary model involves practitioners working together to provide a comprehensive and integrated treatment package, using a common treatment philosophy, and constant communication between team members that operate from the same physical location. 6 The treatment usually involves the parents or caregivers who are provided with strategies to encourage more adaptive responses to their child's pain. 5 Access to this type of treatment is limited by the scarcity of clinical expertise 7 and geographical barriers. 8 The use of electronic information and communication technology to deliver health services (known as eHealth) 9 has the potential to improve access to a wide range of treatment including pain management programs. This term describes a broad range of service delivery models including phone, videoconferencing, web, or app-based treatment delivery platforms. Services may be delivered solely via digital technology, or combined with traditional face-toface treatments 10 in programs known as \"hybrid\". 11 This feasibility study focuses specifically on videoconferencing. Recent technological advances mean that encrypted video links can be easily shared between clinicians and patients using a variety of devices such as computers, smartphones or iPads without the requirement for the patient to have special software, accounts or dial-in details. 12 Examples include Health Direct Australia VideoCall (https://about. healthdirect.gov.au/video-call). This technology extends the reach of healthcare to the patient's community environment such as their home, school or work. 13 Before the large-scale adoption of this type of technology, it is essential that the benefits are rigorously tested in realworld environments. 13 Changing the delivery mechanism of a treatment may arguably change its nature, so it is important to be aware of this when analyzing efficacy; for example, interacting with a clinician during a videoconference is mechanistically different from interacting with an app on a mobile phone. Research into videoconference pain treatment interventions is emerging but study numbers are low. Despite some promising studies, three systematic reviews evaluating the delivery of adult pain interventions via various eHealth modalities have been unable to unequivocally demonstrate the benefit of videoconferencing due to the low number of studies using this technology. 9, 14, 15 Pediatric literature related to videoconferencing is increasing. A systematic review of technology-based family interventions for a variety of pediatric chronic illnesses identified 23 relevant studies of which the overwhelming majority (87%) featured a hybrid design. Although three studies investigated technologybased interventions for chronic pain or headache, none of these used videoconferencing. The mixed results and varying intervention targets for different chronic diseases made it hard for the authors to draw summative conclusions and they recommended further research evaluating both clinical and economic outcomes, and the identification of the \"active ingredients\" of the interventions. 11 We wished to evaluate whether videoconferencing could be used to deliver components of a pediatric interdisciplinary pain program (PIPP). We developed a program that included a combination of group face-to-face sessions and individual videoconference into the home that we called Hybrid-PIPP. We reasoned that this would provide better outcomes than treatment delivered via individual face-to-face sessions (Standard Care) because the group therapy environment would provide positive peer modelling opportunities, reinforcement, and social support. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the Hybrid-PIPP compared to Standard Care. The feasibility study was designed to a) test the integrity of the study protocol including the eligibility criteria; recruitment and consent process; data collection methods; randomization process; and acceptability of the intervention, and b) inform sample size calculation and selection of primary outcomes for the randomized controlled trial. Exploratory pre-and postintervention outcome measures are reported; however, as this was a feasibility study there was no hypothesis established for statistical significance of treatment efficacy.",

The study protocol was registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ANZCTR 12614000489695) http://www.anzctr.org.au. A non-blinded matched pair randomized controlled model with parallel assignment was used. A matched pair design was chosen to reduce allocation bias by minimizing the differences between the treatment streams that may occur with a non-matched randomization, particularly with small sample sizes and heterogeneous participants. 16 At the point of entry of each participant to the study, the streams represent the best possible balance related to functional disability. 16 As this was a feasibility study, it was not powered to show statistical differences. Following consultation between the clinicians (two of whom had experience in delivering group interdisciplinary pain programs to adults totalling over 30 years), it was determined that three cycles of Hybrid-PIPP groups (with 4 to 8 families in each group) would be used to test the protocol. Because Hybrid-PIPP participants were matched to Standard Care, the intended participant numbers would therefore be between 24 and 48, dependent upon how many participants were randomized to the Hybrid-PIPP groups in each cycle.",

Using the FDI they were classified as either No/ Minimal Disability (0-12), Moderate Disability (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) or Severe Disability (30+). 17 An independent person drew a marble from a concealed bag containing 24 white marbles (indicating Standard Care) and 24 colored marbles (indicating Hybrid-PIPP). Once selected, the marble was not placed back in the bag. This process did not occur if the participant's FDI score matched a previously enrolled participant who had not yet been matched. When this occurred, they were assigned to the stream that did not include their match and the corresponding marble for their stream allocation was removed from the bag to maintain the probability. Participants were offered a place in the alternative stream after their involvement in the study was completed.",

The intervention was informed by several sources 5, 19, 20 and used an interdisciplinary cognitive behavioural pain management model, delivered within a neuroscience psycho-educational framework. The primary themes were the promotion of self-efficacy and increased engagement in functional activities despite pain; independence from medical and social care; and return to normal adolescent activity including school. The treatment model explored how pain can be amplified by thoughts and feelings; physiological responses (fight or flight); and maladaptive behavioural responses to pain. A contemporary pain neuroscience platform was used to describe the perpetuating factors of pain and provide the rationale for engaging in cognitive behavioural pain management strategies including \"balanced thinking\", goal setting, activity management, physical conditioning, communication skills training, sleep health, relaxation and mindfulness, and graded exposure to challenging activities. Participants were encouraged to: identify their own activity/pain patterns; set goals; identify core daily exercises based on treatment goals; plan and prioritize activities; and schedule their days (including avoiding long periods of rest or activity). Parents received the same information as the adolescents in addition to skills training to promote reinforcement of pain management strategies at home. Parents and adolescents were also asked to identify avoidant behaviours and develop a plan to address them using a graded hierarchy. These concepts were presented in age-appropriate terms, using metaphors and analogies to support learning. A file with handouts and worksheets was provided for both adolescents and parents. Families also had support from a school liaison teacher. Clinicians met at least weekly to discuss the participant's progress and provide interdisciplinary support to each other, with one clinician being allocated as a case manager for each participant.",

These included the intervention intensity related to participant disability, and time inefficiencies related to attendance. Because of this, the protocol was considered impracticable without significant modification. Attendance was identified as a significant issue in the Standard Care stream. Whilst intuitively it might appear that flexible appointment scheduling would lead to better attendance, in this study this was not the case. In the Standard Care stream, the families booked sessions at their convenience and were able to reschedule appointments as required. This required considerable administrative and clinician time to coordinate appointments between the 3 practitioners, made more complex by attempts to book sessions with all three clinicians in 1 day to reduce the travel burden on the participants. Despite this flexibility there was frequent poor attendance in this stream including both non-attendance of booked appointments, and poor uptake of offered sessions. Only 63% of the recommended sessions were attended by the families completing the Standard Care stream (that had flexible scheduling policy), compared to 94% in the Hybrid-PIPP stream (that had a rigid scheduling policy) see Table 5 . Further inefficiencies in the Standard Care stream included the inability to leverage clinician time (such as by seeing more than one participant at once in a group), and time required to facilitate data collection. Taken as a whole, within this research protocol the Standard Care model was considered impractical by clinicians.",

Separate videoconference sessions with the adolescent and their parent were also difficult to arrange. The decision to stop recruitment early was related to funding and clinical reasoning that was informed by a) evidence-based guidelines that recommend interventions of at least 60 hrs for individuals presenting with high levels of disability and distress, 24 and b) comparison of participant disability levels to 5 published studies of children with chronic pain summarized by Gauntlett-Gilbert and Eccleston. 25 The authors reported FDI values varying from 11.3 to 26.3. The functional disability in the study cohort was considered high in comparison (Standard Care median 27 (18 \u221241), Hybrid PIIPP median 28.5 ). The 14.5 hr Hybrid-PIPP intervention was determined to be too brief for the study cohort. At the time that the protocol was developed there was no funding allocated to interdisciplinary pediatric pain management in the health service where the study took place. During the study, funding for an intensive pain program became available. Recruitment was stopped at this time because it was considered unethical to continue if a more intensive option was available.
