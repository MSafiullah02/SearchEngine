            "text": "Viral respiratory infections have several etiologies (Table 1) . 7 During seasonal epidemics, rhinoviruses, with more than 100 serotypes, are implicated in 50-80% of cases of the common cold. 8 Other viruses associated with the common cold are coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and adenovirus. They can be distinguished from rhinoviruses in that they cause a much smaller proportion of infections, or cause a higher proportion of lower respiratory or systemic PHARMACOTHERAPY Volume 23, Number 3, 2003 symptoms in addition to nasal symptoms characteristic of colds. With the exception of parainfluenza virus, rhinoviruses can further be distinguished from other respiratory viruses by their ability to cause infection throughout the year, with marked peaks in spring and early fall in temperate regions. The epidemiology of other respiratory viruses is characterized by distinct seasonal peaks, with minimal frequency of infection between peaks. 9 Rhinovirus contains four structural proteins-VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4-that form a nonenveloped, icosahedral capsid. Deep canyons on the capsid surface contain a receptor-binding domain. The virus evades the host immune system because the capsid surface mutates constantly, although the canyons maintain their antigenic specificity. The canyons are too narrow to accommodate the Fab antibody portion, thereby escaping host deactivation, but are large enough to bind the host cell receptor. The intercellular adhesion receptor molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is the major cellular receptor for 90% of rhinoviruses. This receptor is expressed on nasal epithelial cells, with high concentrations in adenoid sinuses. 10 The pathogenesis of rhinovirus infections is not completely understood. Most exposures to the virus result in infection in the absence of specific immunity to the infecting serotype. Transmission occurs to some extent through inhalation of aerosolized particles but mostly through hand-nose or hand-eye contact after contamination of the hand with infected secretions. Rhinovirus then invades the host by binding to its cellular receptor, ICAM-1, on nasal epithelial cells. After host cell invasion and replication, the rhinovirus spreads to epithelial cells of the nasal passages to the pharynx and, in some people, may spread to the large airways. 11 Symptoms of the common cold are generally mild to moderate in healthy individuals. They usually begin 1-2 days after infection, with peak symptoms occurring after 2-4 days. Early symptoms include nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and sore or scratchy throat. Cough is present in approximately 30% of colds and is reported to be the most bothersome and persistent symptom later in the disease course. 12 Most rhinovirus colds last 1 week, but approximately 25% last 2 weeks. 2 In addition to mildly symptomatic colds, rhinovirus infections are associated with a number of upper and lower respiratory tract complications that can have a significant medical impact. Respiratory viruses are important predisposing factors in the development of acute bacterial otitis media, particularly in children. The local edema associated with viral respiratory infections presumably causes obstruction of the eustachian tube, which can lead to the development of acute bacterial otitis media. Rhinovirus has been reported as the most common virus associated with otitis media. Similarly, rhinoviral infection may predispose patients to bacterial sinusitis by entrapping bacteria in the sinus cavity. 13 Rhinoviruses are increasingly associated with lower respiratory tract illness in adults and children. A study in adults aged 60-90 years reported lower respiratory tract symptoms in 65% of rhinoviral infections. Of those who consulted a doctor, 75% received antibiotic treatment. 14 Evaluation of an outbreak of rhinovirus infection in a long-term care facility demonstrated the capability of the virus to cause severe respiratory illness, especially in patients with underlying lung disease. 15 In infants less than 12 months of age, infection required hospitalization for lower respiratory tract symptoms, especially bronchiolitis, and deterioration in bronchopulmonary dysplasia. 16, 17 Rhinoviruses were implicated in exacerbations of asthma in adults and children. 18, 19 In patients older than 2 years, they were the most frequently isolated pathogens in asthma exacerbations and hospitalizations. 20 In addition, asthmatic children experience more frequent rhinovirus infections than their siblings, and the infections last longer. 21 Rhinoviruses also are implicated in up to 40% of exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. 22",

The enterovirus groups share a similar pathogenic process of disease but differ in the target organ affected after blood-borne dissemination. Enteroviral infection results from fecal-oral contamination and to a lesser degree respiratory inhalation. Viral replication can occur in the nasopharynx, but the principal site of viral entry is the gastrointestinal tract. Enteroviruses are responsible for a wide spectrum of infections involving almost every organ system ranging from nonfocal febrile illness to encephalitis, myocarditis, and fulminant neonatal sepsis. 23 Infection of the CNS ranges from meningitis, which generally is associated with an excellent prognosis, to encephalitis, which can be associated with profound acute disease and long-term sequelae or even death. Enteroviral infection also commonly causes nonspecific febrile illness that affects 10-15 million people in the United States annually. 1 The infection may also present as a vesicular disease affecting the skin as in handfoot-mouth disease and herpangina. In addition, patients can present with myocarditis, hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, and pleurodynia.",

The drug had potent antiviral activity against 214 enteroviral isolates in a concentration range of 0.002-3.4 \u00b5M. The minimum inhibitory concentration of 50% of isolates (MIC 50 ) and MIC 90 for enteroviral serotypes were 0.03 \u00b5M or less and 0.18 \u00b5M or less, respectively. The MIC 50 and MIC 80 for rhinovirus serotypes were 0.21 \u00b5M or less and 0.78 \u00b5M or less, respectively. 29 Pharmacokinetics Pleconaril has linear pharmacokinetics best characterized by a two-compartment open model with first-order absorption. Table 2 shows the drug' s pharmacokinetic profile after a single oral dose of 200 or 400 mg. [30] [31] [32] [33] The maximum plasma pleconaril concentrations were well above reported MIC 50 for most nonpolio enteroviral isolates previously tested. 34 Investigators also found no statistically significant difference in maximum concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) between men and women and young and elderly subjects, thus concluding that dosage adjustments based on sex and age are not necessary. 30 In contrast to dose-proportionate pharmacokinetics in adults, increases in C max and AUC were not noted in neonatal patients receiving a single liquid dose of 5.0 or 7.5 mg/kg. 34 The time to C max (T max ) was similar to that of adults (~ 3.0 hrs). It is probable that developmental differences in gastrointestinal physiology (i.e., decreased gastric lipolytic activity) affected the extent, but not the rate, of intestinal translocation. Despite the variability, plasma concentrations at 12 hours were adequate for treatment of enteroviral infections in neonates. In children aged 2-12 years receiving a single liquid dose of pleconaril 5 mg/kg, C max and AUC were significantly lower, whereas T max remained similar to that of adults. 35 The differences were attributed to increased clearance and volume of distribution in the pediatric population. Nevertheless, plasma pleconaril concentrations 12 hours after the single dose remained approximately 3.5-fold greater than that required to inhibit 90% of nonpolio enteroviruses in culture.",

This suggests that the drug penetrates tissue where viral replication is likely to occur at concentrations several times in excess of those in plasma. 36 Human pharmacokinetic studies involving a single oral dose of 200 or 400 mg determined that despite a protein binding of greater than 99%, the apparent volume of distribution was consistent with significant tissue distribution. 33 Compared with earlier compounds in this class, a trifluoromethyl substitution on the oxadiazole ring was added to confer greater stability to the molecule against hepatic metabolism. After administration of a single oral dose of pleconaril 200 mg to healthy men, unchanged drug was the major component in plasma for up to 12 hours. 37 The authors concluded that pleconaril was slowly but extensively metabolized by reductive cleavage of the trifluoromethyl oxadiazole ring to yield amidine derivatives. Further metabolism involved oxygenation and conjunction of the amidine group or oxidation of the isoxazole ring with subsequent ring opening. ",

These changes were not considered clinically significant, and it was concluded that theophylline does not require a dosage adjustment when administered with pleconaril. The authors further concluded that clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions of pleconaril on other CYP1A2 substrates are unlikely. 38 Pleconaril was found to exhibit biexponential disposition after administration of single and multiple doses. Both a short \u2423-phase half-life (~ 2-3 hrs) and long terminal half-life (~ 180 hrs) contributed substantially to elimination. 31, 37 Investigators also found that renal clearance contributes minimally to total systemic clearance of pleconaril, with less than 1% of the dose excreted unchanged in urine. 31 Clinical Efficacy and Safety",

As a result, efficacy analyses focused on a comparison of pleconaril 3 times/day and matching placebo in patients with documented picornavirus infection (pleconaril 323 patients, placebo 264).",

In these studies menstrual disorders such as early menses, breakthrough bleeding, and menorrhagia, occurred in 3-81% of women taking oral contraceptives. An increased frequency was observed with a longer duration of pleconaril use and with twice-daily dosing. These events are thought to be the result of CYP3A4 induction.

Molecular analysis of the resistance trends showed that single amino acid substitutions could result in up to an 100-fold decrease in susceptibility. 4 In addition, the effects pleconaril may have on different subgroups are of interest. Subjects enrolled in pivotal studies were healthy adults, predominantly white, and 70% women. Since pleconaril may be beneficial for patients with severe colds who have complications or are at risk of developing complications from their infections, the FDA recommended that a broader population be studied, to include asthmatics, children, elderly, and immunosuppressed; those with chronic cardiac or pulmonary disease; and those from other ethnic backgrounds such as African-Americans and Hispanics. 4 An important analysis revealed that pleconaril did not have any beneficial effect on patients who smoke.",
