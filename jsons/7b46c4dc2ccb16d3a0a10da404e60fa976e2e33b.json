Knowledge, attitude, perception of general population of India towards the transmission and prevention plays vital role for effective control measures. The study was conducted to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice of the general public of India on COVID-19. In this study, a web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted between 10 th March to 18 th April 2020. A 19-item questionnaire was generated, Cronbach's alpha was used to measure the internal consistency of the questionnaire & randomly distributed among the public using Google forms through social media networks. The chi-square test or Fischer exact test was used to compare categorical data and multiple linear regression was used to identify factor influencing KAP. Among 7978 participants, the overall knowledge, attitude and practice score was 80.64%, 97.33% and 93.8% consecutively. Majority of Indian population demonstrated preceded good knowledge, positive attitude and good practice regarding COVID-19 pandemic.",

As of April 30, 2020, >3.3 million cases of COVID-19 cases had been confirmed resulting in 234,139 deaths worldwide [4] . In reciprocation to the outbreak, World Health Organization (WHO) declared it as a public health emergency of international concern and called global imperative efforts to prevent the escalation [5] . SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped RNA\u03b2 -coronavirus with an outer fringe of envelope proteins resembling like crown, which has a phylogenetic genome similarity with highly pathogenic and transmissible with another known coronavirus i.e. SARS-CoV- 1 (2003) and MERS-CoV (2012) [6, 7, 8, 9] . Studies suggest the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) of SARS-CoV-2 be around 2.2 or more upto 6 [10], making the virus propagate at an alarming rate and proving to be very expeditious and erratic [11, 12] .",

India is the second-largest internet user in the world with >560 million from 1.39 billion gross population [15] . One threat to the COVID-19 response in India is the ubiquitous spread of misinformation by raising falsehoods like rinsing the nose with saline, spraying of alcohol and chlorine or 5G mobile networks inhibiting the spread of the virus, during the crisis is dangerous because it can mislead and confuse the public [16] . Over 3 billion posts and 100 billion interactions are present on COVID-19 making infodemic spread faster than a pandemic [17] . The most important factor in preventing the spread of the virus locally is the empowered citizens with the right information and taking advisories being issued by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India regularly. To guarantee the final success, people's adherence to these control measures is essential, which is largely affected by their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19 in accordance with KAP theory [18, 19] .",

Furthermore, Sample Characteristics: consisting participants with higher education holds the predication of knowledge Score which is similar to Chinese study but varied with Iranian study [20, 24] , Participants were aware regarding clinical symptoms, transmission, prevention and control of disease contrast to myth busters questions. More than one -third participants agreed about eating citrus fruits and gargling salt water can help prevent infection. According to WHO gargling warm or saltwater and consuming citrus fruits will not kill novel-corona virus [27] . 14% out of hundred think alcohol drinking can kill novel coronavirus. Alcohol are highly inflammable substance as well as strong disinfectants, it can be used as a cleansing agent for surfaces [28] . No evidence supports alcohol consumption can kill the virus, whereas intake of excessive alcohol can cause health related complications. Robust association between gender and knowledge score regarding COVID-19 was found in the present study. Multivariate analysis showed confounding factors (education level and occupation) as strong indicator of knowledge domain regarding COVID-19 which postulates the combination of better access to information and high education level leads to appropriate apprehension and comprehension of information on covid-19, consequent to better knowledge on COVID-19. Therefore, government and public health policy-makers should recognize target populations for COVID-19 prevention and health education.",

Unfortunately, 3.6% males are going to crowded place because of two potential reason: first in India men are likely to expose in outwork exposing them to crowded place, secondly according to studies men and adolescents have more risk-taking behaviour which suggestive of dangerous practice towards COVID-19. Similar findings were obtained in previous studies conducted in china [20] . Massive agreement was found towards the idea of lockdown in India, which has helped to prevent potential rise in cases.

Similar scoring pattern as knowledge was kept. Cronbach's alpha was used to measure the internal consistency of the questionnaire. The data were analysed via statistical Package for the Social Sciences (IBM Corp. Released 2013. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 22 Armonk, Chicago, Illinois: IBM Corp). Mean with standard deviation was calculated for descriptive analysis and the number with percentage was calculated for categorical variables. Knowledge, attitude, and practice score were compared by demographics with chi-square or Fischer's exact test as appropriate. Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to establish the relationship between demographic variables as independent variables and KAP as the outcome variable. Pearson Coefficient of correlations and VIF (Variance of inflation factor) were used to determine the relationship between knowledge, attitude, and practice.
