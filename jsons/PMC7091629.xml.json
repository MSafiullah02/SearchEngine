            "text": "Among the factors influencing engraftment after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, stem cell dose and T cell content of the graft as well as the host's immune defense play an important role, opposing each other.1 The recipient's T lymphocytes have been recognized in the past as the main mediators of active graft rejection.2,3 Consequently, effective depletion or inactivation of the recipient's T cells in the conditioning therapy for allogeneic transplantation is desirable for rapid and sustained engraftment. It has been shown that some T cells can escape depletion by chemotherapy alone.4 Therefore, antithymocyte (ATG) or antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) preparations have been employed as additional immunosuppressants in various conditioning regimens. Mostly, an improved engraftment in these patients has been reported.5 ATG mediate their effects even after transplantation, leading to reduced incidence and severity of GVHD.5,6,7 The latter probably derives from persisting antibodies, thus affecting donor T cells after graft infusion.8 Here, we report on a series of 10 patients who were the first worldwide to receive Tecelac (RATG) as ATG in their conditioning therapy for allogeneic stem cell transplantation.",

Conventionally employed ATG preparations are obtained by immunizing horses or rabbits with thymocytes, T cells from the thoracic duct, or lymphoblastic cell lines. They consist of a mixture of T cell-specific antibodies as well as non-T cell-specific antibodies, to a variety of receptors, enzymes and adhesion molecules.8\nIn vitro testing showed marked differences in specific activities between preparations.14 This is reflected in the cumulative doses commonly employed in conditioning, which range from 10 to 120 mg/kg body weight, depending on the preparation and regimen used.5,15,16 Adverse reactions are reported to occur in 60\u201380% of patients, mostly fever and chills, malaise, diarrhea, headache, nausea and vomiting, fall in blood pressure, dyspnea, transient respiratory arrest and serum sickness.16,17,18,19",

Milder reactions were seen in these on the second day. Mostly, the complaints could be handled well with fever and pain relieving drugs, but once the need to interrupt administration arose. It seems interesting that among the patients with more pronounced symptoms were two who had not received lymphotoxic substances before. Symptoms correlated with a marked increase in C-reactive protein after the first infusion without evidence of infection. One patient showed acute allergic symptoms followed by a delayed reaction with inguinal skin manifestations without need for therapy and without accompanying other complaints. This patient had received prior therapy with RATG, which may have led to sensitization and early-onset cutaneous serum-sickness syndrome.19 The toxicity as noted in the toxicity score was most probably caused by the other cytostatic drugs administered in parallel for the first time. The adverse reactions seen in our patients are similar to those described by others.
