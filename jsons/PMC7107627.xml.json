            "text": "Organisms causing infections reach the lung from a variety of sources. These pathogens include both common gram positive and negative pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively, as well as anaerobes (see Table 2).4 Many bacterial pathogens are nasopharyngeal commensals, which immunosuppressed individuals are less able to effectively clear from the lungs after aspiration. Respiratory pathogens are also commonly inhaled from infected contacts by droplet spread. The commonest causative organisms in this group are the respiratory viruses (see Table 3), which usually only cause mild, self-limiting infections in immunocompetent individuals but in patients with hematological malignancy present with relatively severe symptoms, prolonged infection, and higher rates of pneumonia and death.5\u20137 Less common causes of inhaled droplet lung infections are Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumonia, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Table 3). Inhalation of environmental organisms that do not usually cause infection in an immunocompetent host is another significant source of respiratory infection. These include Aspergillus species, other filamentous fungi, Nocardia, and nontuberculous mycobacteria. Aspergillus in particular can affect up to 10% of patients with hematological malignancy.8 Immunosuppression associated with hematological malignancy may also allow reactivation of organisms that are either dormant or persist at low numbers within the lung. These pathogens include Pneumocystis jirovecii, which seems to be a lung commensal that replicates to cause disease in certain types of immunosuppression unless patients are given appropriate prophylaxis.9 Reactivation is also the mode of infection for pneumonitis caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV) and other herpes viruses, and for some cases of M. tuberculosis occurring in subjects with latent infection. Finally, infections from other parts of the body can spread to the lung via hematogenous spread, for example, Candida species and bacterial seeding as septic emboli from indwelling catheters and lines.",

Fortunately, an understanding of the specific immune deficiencies that act as specific risk factors for specific organisms (Table 4) in combination with clinical parameters such as speed of onset (Table 5) and radiological appearance usually allows the differential diagnosis to be narrowed down. This in turn then allows the formation of a logical targeted diagnostic and treatment plan. In patients who do not improve rapidly with first-line therapy with broad spectrum antibiotics, cross-sectional thoracic CT imaging is essential as it provides much better definition of the pattern of radiological changes than a chest radiograph. These radiological patterns can be broken down into three main groups: consolidation, nodules (micro- and macro-), and diffuse changes, which can be further subdivided into ground glass and tree-in-bud patterns. We discuss the likely causes for each of these radiological patterns and how this guides the appropriate initial investigations and treatment options.",

This clinical pattern is highly suggestive of pneumonia caused by pyogenic bacterial pathogens10 associated with community and hospital acquired pneumonias, often originating from microaspiration of nasopharyngeal commensals. Blood and sputum cultures are essential, and treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics incorporating gram negative cover should be commenced, and most patients will respond to these making invasive investigation with bronchoscopy unnecessary. However, if the patient does not respond rapidly, that is, within 48 to 72 hours, infection with a highly resistant organism such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus or multiresistant P. aeruginosa (resistant to three of the following: carbapenem, ceftazidime, tobramycin, or ciprofloxacin) should be considered. This will necessitate escalation to second-line antibiotics, and if the patient can tolerate bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of the affected lobe should be performed to try and obtain a clear microbiological diagnosis.",

While transbronchial biopsy has low yield and is not recommended for the diagnosis of invasive fungal disease12 given the complication rate of pneumothorax in particular, it may be useful in confirming alternative diagnoses. Dense peripheral lesions adjacent to the pleura are amenable to CT guided percutaneous biopsy.

The presence of macronodules should always raise the suspicion of an IFD, the commonest of which is invasive aspergillosis, the majority of which are caused by A. fumigatus. Several other Aspergillus and filamentous fungi species such as mucormycetes can cause IFD and have similar clinical and radiological findings.8 The CT scan has several distinct appearances that increase the likelihood that a macronodule is caused by IFD, though are not necessarily very specific. A surrounding halo of ground glass (Fig. 1B) is a classical sign of angioinvasive fungal disease, with the halo representing hemorrhage, and the air crescent sign (Fig. 1C) due to the formation of a fungal ball within a cavity caused by fungal destruction of lung tissue is also highly suggestive of IFD.13,14 Macronodules caused by IFD undergo a classic evolution of changes on CT as the infection is controlled, with the nodule developing the air crescent sign, followed by thinning of the cavity wall and shrinkage of its overall size, associated with clearance of the associated surrounding consolidation.15",

Antigen testing using the serum galactomannan has a sensitivity of 41\u201378% and specificity of 60\u201395% when two sequential samples have an optical density >0.5 giving a negative predictive value of up to 95% in azole naive patients in the highest risk groups (neutropenic patients)15,23,24 but does not confirm IFD species. Furthermore, serum galactomannan is less accurate in patients receiving triazole prophylaxis,24\u201326 which is now in widespread use in hemato-oncology patients. Measuring galactomannan in BAL instead has a much greater sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 89% even in the setting of triazole prophylaxis,24 and hence a negative BAL galactomannan can allow de-escalation of treatment with antifungals. Mucormycetes have little galactomannan in their cell walls rendering serum and BAL analysis for this test insensitive.27Aspergillus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) should be sensitive but may not be specific due to widespread presence of Aspergillus species in the environment, and as yet there is little standardization between kits and is not in widespread use.28 The lateral flow device provides a point of care test for fungal wall antigens that is as sensitive and specific as PCR29 and has significant clinical promise but is not yet in wide commercial use.",

The incidence is as low as 0.1% in patients receiving prophylaxis.48 Pulmonary coinfection is common, particularly with CMV, and mortality rates have been reported to be as high as 30\u201360% in hematological malignancy,49 although in our experience it is considerably less than this. CT findings are often highly suggestive of PJP, classically showing diffuse bilateral ground glass shadowing with a predilection for the upper lobes and marked subpleural sparing.

The diagnosis of PJP can also be confirmed in some patients by identification of cysts in bronchoalveolar lavage using immunofluorescence, although this is often negative in hematology patients. Overall, in patients with a classical clinical and radiological presentation the diagnosis of PJP can be confirmed by the response to empirical treatment, usually with high dose co-trimoxazole or clindamycin and primaquine. Adjunct systemic corticosteroids are used in hypoxic patients but do complicate assessing the response to empirical treatment as noninfective causes of a pneumonitis can also improve with corticosteroid treatment.",

Respiratory viral infections are very common in patients with hematological disease and can now be readily diagnosed by PCR on a nasopharyngeal aspirate. The CT often demonstrates widespread, diffuse, symmetrical tree-in-bud changes, although these infections can also cause ground glass infiltrates. In comparison to immunocompetent individuals, respiratory viral infections in patients with hematological malignancy (particularly after HSCT) are more prolonged, lasting weeks and even months, and lead to an increased risk of respiratory compromise due to the development of viral or secondary bacterial pneumonia.56 The viruses recognised to cause respiratory infection in hemato-oncology patients are noted in Table 3. Some have specific treatments though the data for efficacy are largely limited to case series. Ribavirin is used for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), although it appears to have little effect once patients develop respiratory failure.57 Adenovirus is often cultured, though less commonly causing infection, can be treated with Cidofovir.58,59 Neuraminidase inhibitors reduce mortality due to influenza infection,60 although they are less effective in patients who are immunosuppressed, have GvHD, lymphopenia, or older age;61 preemptive vaccination is key in preventing infection.62 There are no recognized organism-specific treatments for parainfluenza,63 human metapneumovirus,7 and rhinovirus.64",

These cause patchy tree-in-bud infiltrates associated with bronchial wall thickening and dilatation and are usually caused by Gram negative pathogens such as K. pneumoniae or P. aeruginosa that will require prolonged therapy with appropriate antibiotics. Too short an antibiotic course will allow the infection to recur, and this can lead to a vicious cycle of recurrent infections with an inability to gain weight or fully recover before the next infection occurs. Antibiotic prophylaxis and correction of hypogammaglobulinemia with supplementary immunoglobulins is important for these patients and is also recommended in other patients with hematological malignancy and secondary antibody deficiency in the setting of recurrent infections.65",

            "text": "Almost all hematology patients presenting acutely with fever and dyspnoea will require broad-spectrum antibiotics. Starting antifungals with the initial fever does not improve outcomes compared to delaying to day 4 if the fever does not settle.66 Similarly, cross-sectional CT is only necessary if the symptoms do not resolve rapidly with antibiotics.67 If the fever persists, then characteristic CT changes in the clinical context (speed of onset, immune defects, other clinical features) will often indicate the need for specific treatments, for example, liposomal amphotericin or voriconazole in neutropenic patients with a macronodule with surrounding halo. However, the wide differential diagnosis means that empirical treatment targeting different infectious and noninfectious causes is often required. Microbiological confirmation remains variably successful; culture techniques are slow and sensitivity can be poor, hence the development of biomarkers and PCR to increase sensitivity. While invasive procedures such as bronchoscopy or biopsy can give vital diagnostic information and in particular allow the de-escalation of antifungals and make alternative diagnoses, patients can deteriorate rapidly and be too hypoxic for such investigations. Furthermore, many cases of respiratory problems in hematology patients have a combination of causes, so even when a microbe has been identified, this may not prevent broader treatment. Another significant issue is when to stop therapy in patients treated empirically with multiple agents who then improve, as the cause of the underlying problem may remain unclear. Most bacterial infections resolve with a few days of antibiotics, but aspergillosis can require prolonged therapy to prevent recurrence. Exactly how long antifungals should be continued is not known; serum galactomannan levels may have some utility, with a \u226535% reduction after 1 week associated with a good clinical outcome,68,69 but mainly outcome is monitored by observing radiological responses. It is unclear at which stage during this evolution that it is safe to stop antifungals without leading to a significant risk of recurrence.",

These allow various pathogens to cause disease, and the respiratory tract is commonly affected; this is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Infections must be treated promptly, requiring empirical therapy chosen to cover the most likely pathogens given the clinical presentation. An understanding of the relevant immune defect, along with the recognition of patterns of clinical presentation and findings on cross-sectional CT imaging, allows logical deduction of likely culprits and targeted microbiological and molecular investigations to help narrow the differential diagnosis. This is with the caveat that there is significant cross-over between radiological findings, and a high prevalence of noninfective respiratory complications that are often diagnoses of exclusion. As such, there are many occasions when the specific diagnosis is never discovered, and critically ill patients have to be treated for multiple organisms and noninfective complications empirically. There is an urgent need for improved rapid diagnostics with better sensitivity and specificity to allow more directed treatment of respiratory infections in hematological malignancy. Ideally, future research should focus on the development of point of care tests that accurately identify specific organisms. If possible, these will be noninvasive and easy to perform even on critically ill patients, allowing pathogen-specific treatments and minimising unnecessary drug-related toxicity.",
