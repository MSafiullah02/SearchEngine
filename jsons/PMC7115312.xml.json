The bibliographic references for each article, review, or book chapter were systematically researched. The inocula transmitted by blood transfusion, in the clinical laboratory, during accidental sharps injuries in the health care setting, or during dissection represent situations with rising transmissibility profiles (\nFig 1). When several cases of occupational infection of a given bloodborne pathogen were associated with various types of exposure, we described the case associated with the exposure with the lowest theoretic inoculum order to approximate the pathogen's transmissibility. Cases that occurred following exposure to aerosolized BBF were not included because it was not possible to differentiate between respiratory and mucocutaneous routes for transmission.",

In France, the yearly number of notified, occupationally acquired viral hepatitis by HCW to the social security system went from around 600 in the mid-1970s to less than 50 in recent years, thanks to the compulsory anti-HBV immunization in HCW and improvements in hygiene procedures. One case of occupational coinfection with the virus responsible for hepatitis D has been described in a surgeon.8 Immunization against HBV would have protected him against infection with virus Delta, which cannot develop unless there is concurrent HBV infection. It became clear in the mid-1970s that HCW were also exposed to the risk of becoming infected with \u201cnon-A, non-B\u201d hepatitis. Most of these were due to HCV, which was identified in 1991. In France, 43 occupational seroconversions for HCV were documented in HCW following exposure to BBF as of June 30, 2001, including 32 cases in which the source patient was known to be infected with HCV.9 Finally, a case of transmission of hepatitis G following BBF exposure was proven at the molecular level in a nurse with chronic HCV infection, who was an asymptomatic carrier of HGV RNA without any other biologic sign.10\n",

This suggests that the number of HCW occupationally infected with HIV is underestimated. In France, 42 cases of probable or documented occupational HIV infections were documented in the health care setting as of June 30, 2001, including 13 documented seroconversions.9 The successes achieved in the control of exposures to BBF and the advent of potent treatments against HIV that allowed many HIV-infected patients to avoid being hospitalized have reduced HCWs' risk of being injured with HIV-contaminated hollow-bore needles in France as in other European countries such as Italy (SIROH, unpublished data). No new case of occupational infection with HIV has been documented in France since 1997.9\n",

Although some are known to be endemic (Lassa), these sudden, high-visibility outbreaks are mainly health care-related. Hospital referral of patients with febrile hemorrhagic syndromes caused by Lassa, Ebola, Crimean-Congo, or, more recently in Angola, Marburg virus, viruses was followed by grouped cases of secondary transmission and spillover into the community in some cases.14, 15 Most documented VHF victims are frontline HCW with little or no access to means of protection while exposed to the BBF of patients. One case of suspected interhuman transmission of Hantavirus following exposure of nonintact skin to BBF in an Argentinian HCW has been described but remains arguable.16, 17 Cases of transmission to laboratory personnel have been described for Sabia virus in Brazil18 and Ebola in the United Kingdom19 and Russia. Patients infected with other VHF viruses have been admitted in hospitals of industrialized countries20, 21 with no documented case of secondary transmission. The recent emergence of West Nile virus in the Northern Hemisphere has led to cases of occupational infection in laboratory personnel.22\n",

A case of accidental inoculation of recombinant vaccine virus in a laboratory technician has been published.30 Progression was benign because this technician had been vaccinated against smallpox some years earlier, and no seroconversion was noted. The detailed analysis of lymphocytic response markers showed, however, that the virus had been transmitted. The uses of this new technique may become more widespread in the years to come. The risk of occupational infection will therefore increase in a growing number of research laboratory personnel in cases of ex vivo handling as well as health care personnel in cases of in vivo gene therapy.31 The potential consequences of infection in health care or laboratory personnel by genetically modified vectors should be systematically documented, and primary and secondary prevention methods must be known to all.",

Seven (33%) cases occurred in physicians or biologists/researchers. In 5 cases (24%), infection was caused by mucocutaneous contact. This percentage of transmissions occurring after a low-volume exposure such as MCC is high as compared with those found for documented cases of HIV or HCV infection, at 8.5% and 2.3%, respectively.9 Although the transmission rate cannot be evaluated precisely for lack of denominator data, this may reflect a high rate of transmission.12 Diagnosis was excessively delayed in some cases. Such delay may have severe consequences, such as occurred with the death of an Italian physician.38\n",

For other pathogens, the transmission risk cannot be rigorously assessed because of the small number of documented cases. It is nevertheless reflected to some extent by the mode of transmission: the lower the volume of the inoculum that causes infection by a given pathogen, the higher the theoretic risk of transmission for that pathogen. A low transmissibility and rare pathogen may be transmitted only by contact with cultures in the research laboratory, for instance, whereas a ubiquitous and highly transmissible pathogen may be acquired following MCC in the clinical setting. Some cases of occupational infection, however, were described only in the laboratory. This may be due to the pathogen's prevalence being extremely low in the clinical setting but may principally reflect the higher risk of transmission associated with concentrated cultures used in the laboratory setting.",

Furthermore, they must bear in mind that the risk of BBF exposure does not only concern HCW but all personnel at risk of exposure to BBF or BBF-soiled devices. A high proportion of documented cases occurred in laboratory personnel, and a few others occurred in emergency assistance, police, or health care waste elimination personnel.60, 61, 62, 63 Finally, veterinary personnel or animal technicians in laboratories are exposed to infection risks with zoonotic pathogens following exposure to BBF.",
