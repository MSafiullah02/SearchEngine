The first case was a 74-year-old woman with large left pectoral muscle hematoma due to rupture of superior thoracic artery, probably occurring during patient\u2019s mobilization while she was on the respirator in the prone position. The second case was 71-year-old male with large hematoma of left iliopsoas muscle; the patient required electrical cardioversion 2 days before due to atrial fibrillation, possibly causing traumatic injury of lumbar arteries [3]. On the 3rd day, we observed a large rectus sheath hematoma extending into the prevesical space of Retzius fed by both the right and left inferior epigastric arteries, in a 71-year-old woman with renal insufficiency. All three cases were prescribed 6000UI LMWH/12 h. The last case was a 81-year-old man with a large hematoma of the left thigh fed by multiple branches of the profunda femoral artery, who was prescribed a unusual high dose of LMWH (8000UI/12 h). All cases were successfully managed by coil embolization.",

In the specific setting of hemorrhage, we realized the importance of having blood products already available in the angiosuite even in hemodynamically stable patients, in case blood transfusion is needed during the procedure. Moreover, while planning the dedicated workflows, it is important to take into account the role of the anesthesiologist. In the specific case of a COVID-19 patient, the anesthesiologist accompanies the patient from the intensive care unit to the angiographic suite. This condition implies that he/she is to be considered \u201ccontaminated\u201d when entering the angiosuite. To ensure radiation protection, dedicated aprons and thyroid shields should made be available to be worn by the anesthesiologist above the potentially contaminated personal protective equipments, before entering the angiosuite. They would then be decontaminated at the end of the procedure.",

Prophylaxis with LMWH has been recommended in these patients, although it should be administered with caution, taking into account comorbidities, possible disease-related thrombocytopenia and potential interactions with other drugs. IR units must therefore be prepared to manage bleedings, by setting specific workflows and paying attention to any potential source of contamination.",
