            "text": "Although PCR is a highly sensitive and efficient method to amplify a target region of the DNA or RNA, the repeated thermal cycling requires both time and energy for amplification. Isothermal amplification methods are preferred as point-of-care tests, especially in resource limited areas, because they are more energy efficient. Two common isothermal amplification methods in common use are nucleic acid sequence\u2013based amplification (NASBA) and transcription-mediated amplification (TMA). In both of these methods, RNA amplification occurs based on a retroviral replication model.10, 11, 12 The RNA target is reverse transcribed into cDNA using a reverse transcriptase enzyme and a primer containing the T7 promoter region. Then, the RNA strand in the RNA-cDNA hybrid is degraded either by endogenous RNAase H activity (as in TMA) or by the use of added RNAase H enzyme (as in NASBA). The cDNA strand then gets amplified by DNA polymerase activity of the reverse transcriptase, and the use of a second primer produces a double-stranded DNA containing the T7 promoter sequence. This leads to synthesis of 100-1,000 copies of the RNA target sequence, which then continue the cycle of amplification. The subsequent detection of the amplicons is achieved by hybridization assays using chemiluminescent or fluorescent probes.13 Both TMA and NASBA are primer-driven synthesis of target nucleic acid; therefore, primer design is important during assay development. However, because single-stranded RNA is the product, unlike conventional PCR, temperature-driven denaturation and primer annealing is not required, making the reaction isothermal. Theoretically, in approximately 30 minutes, 109 copies are generated, therefore enabling sensitive detection of RNA targets in shorter time. The use of a multienzyme complex system and the inherent difficulty of this method to amplify double-stranded DNA that require denaturation are deterrents to its widespread use. Additionally, this is end point amplification because chemiluminescent probes are used to detect the amplified product after hybridization, and subsequent protection of the hybridized product adds a level of complexity to the assay. Isothermal reactions, including these and others, such as strand displacement amplification and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), are also used in commercial assays14, 15 and are particularly favored in resource-limited areas where thermocycling equipment may not be easily available.15 The most extensively used technology in resource-limited settings is the LAMP. It has been widely evaluated for the diagnosis of malaria and tuberculosis (TB).16, 17 The sensitivity and specificity of malaria detection has been reported to be as high as 95%-99% using LAMP technology. In recent studies, the sensitivity and specificity of LAMP technology was found to be comparable with the GeneXpert TB/RIF assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA).16 With the price of the assay ranging from $1.00-$5.30, depending on whether it is developed locally or purchased commercially, LAMP assays are an attractive point-of-care diagnostic in the field. The major hindrance to use of isothermal amplification techniques is the complex primer design and the need for a sensitive detection strategy.17\n",

Instead of amplification of the DNA or RNA by use of enzymes, these assays amplify the signal generated by the probe hybridized to the target DNA. Because there is no amplification of target involved, the likelihood of extraneous contamination is reduced, and for the same reason, the signal is proportional to the amount of target, making it useful for quantitative assays.18 Although target amplification assays are inherently more sensitive, signal amplification assays are often preferred, especially when measuring viral RNA in blood because reverse transcription and conversion to cDNA is not required. The branched DNA assay, hybrid capture assay, and Cleavase Invader assays are examples of signal amplification\u2013based assays that have been used in quantitative assays for HIV and for detection of HPV, N gonorrhea and C trachomatis.18, 19, 20\n",

            "text": "Any discussion regarding advances in clinical microbiology would be incomplete without mention of the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF). Few technologic advances have made as much impact on the identification of microbes. For almost a century, pathogen identification after a positive culture was based on morphology and metabolic profiling by the use of biochemical reactions. The MALDI-TOF uses laser pulses to ionize analyte molecules, which then desorb into a gaseous phase and are allowed to pass through an electric field where they accelerate and separate based on their mass and charge (m/z). A pattern is generated, which is then matched against a database for identification.26 MALDI-TOF has reduced turnaround time for identification of bacteria, yeasts, and mycobacteria from >48 hours to <30 minutes. It can also be used to identify pathogens directly from blood cultures, and there are some preliminary studies showing that antimicrobial susceptibility can be predicted using this technique.27 The advent of DNA-based identification methods, especially sequencing of the ribosomal RNA gene, made rapid and precise identification of pathogens possible. Both traditional Sanger sequencing and next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have been used to identify pathogens directly from both fresh and formalin-fixed specimens. This technology is also used in phylogenetic analyses of outbreak strains to reconstruct transmission and implement infection control measures. However, because it is technologically complex and expensive, its routine use in the clinical laboratory is currently impractical.28\n",

This allows for improved patient outcomes and appropriate institution of therapy leading to substantial cost savings based on institutional isolation procedures.33 In many resource-limited areas, rapid diagnosis of TB is achieved by microscopy, which is rather inexpensive but lacks sensitivity. Compared with culture, microscopy detects only 45%-80% of pulmonary TB cases.22 Microscopy also has a low positive predictive value for TB; 50%-80% in areas where non-TB mycobacteria are isolated.34 In a recent meta-analysis, the Xpert TB/RIF assay had a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 89% and 99%, respectively, as an initial test replacing smear microscopy.35 In multiple studies, the Xpert TB/RIF has been shown to outperform smear microscopy by establishing a diagnosis of TB in smear-negative cases (where sensitivity is 67%) and predicting rifampicin resistance with high accuracy.36, 37, 38 The assay's limit of detection for MTB in sputum is 600 colony forming units/mL.31 The assay is performed on Cepheid's GeneXpert within a cartridge where the reagents and specimen are contained within the system so no extraneous contamination or biosafety concerns remain. It requires minimal hands-on time of 15-20 minutes. This assay is especially useful in high-prevalence, low-resource areas where treatment can be initiated early after rapid diagnosis, often at the site of collection.

Additionally, NAATs were found to be 20%-50% more sensitive for diagnosis of chlamydial infections than traditional culture methods.41 There are several FDA-approved or FDA-cleared tests available for screening specimens for C trachomatis/N gonorrhoeae (CT/NG). All currently available assays simultaneously amplify both CT/NG using rt-PCR, TMA, or strand displacement amplification assay. Depending on the assay, either the ribosomal RNA gene or the cryptic plasmid of C trachomatis is targeted (Table 1\n). These targets are specific for C trachomatis and do not cross-react with any other human bacteria. For N gonorrhoeae, segments of the ribosomal RNA or pilin or Opa proteins are targeted. These are mostly specific; however, in some of the assays the primers for N gonorrhoeae may cross react with human commensal species of Neisseria. This becomes especially important when using NAATs for specimens from pharyngeal or rectal swabs.41\n",

With the emergence of multidrug-resistant N gonorrhoeae and extensively drug-resistant N gonorrhoeae, there is rising concern that this may become an untreatable superbug.47 Some authorities maintain that strengthening culture-based surveillance of local resistance patterns is an increasingly important tool for the detection of resistant N gonorrhoeae strains and monitoring their spread. For this to be accomplished, microbiologic culture is required to perform susceptibility testing. Therefore, the CDC recommends culture and susceptibility on all patients with suspected treatment failures.41 Another area of concern when using NAATs for diagnosis is suspected sexual abuse in minors. In such cases, it is advisable to check with local regulations or authorities if NAATs are acceptable.",

Molecular assays play a key role in both the diagnosis and management of HCV. In fact, the virus was originally identified using molecular techniques because this flavivirus is difficult to culture.51 The current diagnostic algorithm for HCV includes the use of a serologic assay for detection of antibodies; if positive, this is followed by an NAAT to confirm the stage of infection. A positive NAAT indicates chronic, active infection with HCV. A negative NAAT, in the presence of anti-HCV antibodies, indicates spontaneous resolution of infection. However, a repeat NAAT is advisable in 6-12 months because low-level viremia is not uncommon in chronic HCV. Additionally, viral RNA can be detected in serum as early as 1-3 weeks after exposure and is useful in evaluating occupational exposure to HCV. Routine use of quantitative NAAT is also recommended before initiation of therapy for chronic HCV and for monitoring the virologic response to therapy. Because qualitative NAATs should detect 50 HCV RNA IU/mL with equal sensitivity for all genotypes and because most quantitative PCR assays for HCV have a lower limit of detection of 30 RNA copies/mL, most clinical laboratories have switched to using quantitative assays.52\n",

The Xpert C. difficile test (Cepheid) is different in that it is a multiplexed assay that amplifies 2 different genes specific to toxigenic strains of C difficile: one that encodes for toxin B (tcdB), and one that regulates toxin production (tcdC). Analytical sensitivity of the Xpert C. difficile assay (Cepheid) ranges from 23-460 colony forming units/swab, depending on the strain of C difficile (http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/reviews/K110203.pdf). Regardless of the assay format used, a positive PCR assay only indicates that the patient is positive for toxigenic strains of C difficile. In asymptomatic patients, PCR assays for C difficile should not to be used as even tests of cure.57 The problem is compounded by the fact that there are multiplexed gastrointestinal (GI) panels, such as the BioFire FilmArray (BioM\u00e9rieux, Salt Lake City, UT), that now include C difficile as one of the targets causing a reporting dilemma for asymptomatic carriage of C difficile regardless of clinical suspicion. For similar reasons, testing for C difficile is not recommended in children <1 year of age. Clinical illness is rarely reported before 12-24 months of age, and it is possible that neonates/infants may lack the cellular machinery to bind and process the toxins of C difficile.58 Infection preventionists should be aware of the possibility of false-positive C difficile results and work with the laboratory and clinicians to correctly interpret these results.",

Early diagnosis and therapy are critical but need to be balanced with antimicrobial stewardship efforts.63 The nonspecific signs and symptoms make prompt laboratory diagnosis important. Although blood cultures are the mainstay of diagnosis, rapid techniques are often sought and depended on. With the advent of molecular panels that use positive blood culture as a specimen, identification of a pathogen is possible in 2 hours. Some of these panels actually detect the presence of drug resistance genes, such as the mecA or vanA gene, if the identified pathogen is MRSA or Enterococcus spp. Two panels that are frequently used are the Vergiene Blood Culture Test (Nanosphere) and the FilmArray Blood Culture Identification Panel (BioM\u00e9rieux). The Verigene uses microarray technology to identify bacteria and some resistance mechanisms in >3 hours. The organism's DNA is hybridized to the microarray and then is detected with signal amplification. The FilmArray panel uses a nested multiplexed PCR with melt curve analysis to identify bacteria, yeast, and a few resistance mechanisms in approximately 1 hour. In conjunction with antimicrobial stewardship, these assays help direct appropriate treatment.64 Sensitivity and specificity of detection are still limited by the targets included in the panel.64 Additionally, in a polymicrobial culture, sensitivity may not be equal for all organisms, affecting overall performance.64\n",

Multiplex PCR assays for respiratory viruses have made a tremendous impact in the diagnostic laboratory and on infection control practice. The increased sensitivity and faster turnaround time of these assays have significantly increased the laboratory's capacity to detect respiratory viruses. This also ensures early initiation of appropriate therapy, reduction in use of antibiotics, and timely implementation of isolation precautions by infection preventionists. Multiplex PCR assays also complement syndromic surveillance by public health authorities, through identification of respiratory viruses in circulation in the community. There are several commercially available assays with variable technology, complexity, and hands-on time, but they generally have comparable performance characteristics (Table 3\n). Some assays such as the Verigene RV flex panel (Nanosphere) provide the option of phased release of results; therefore, results for common viruses such as influenza and RSV are released first and other less common agents can be suppressed until physicians request the results. There are several studies that have shown that the use of rapid respiratory pathogen panel (RPP) testing allows patients with viral or bacterial respiratory illnesses to be quickly diagnosed equating to shorter lengths of hospital stay and earlier initiation of antiviral therapy when appropriate (eg, influenza). These studies also show that the use of RPP significantly affects isolation for infection prevention and antimicrobial stewardship efforts.73\n",

We can now identify and precisely characterize emerging pathogens, or trace the source of outbreaks in a matter of days, as exemplified in the German outbreak of Enterohemorrhagic E coli O104:H4.87 For some of the diseases previously discussed, there are numerous assays from which to choose. These choices would depend on the relative performance of the assay, cost, complexity, infrastructure of the laboratory, and patient population served. As we embark on this new path of personalizing medicine and enhanced utilization of the laboratory, the responsibilities of laboratorians, physicians, and infection preventionists increase. With the advent of newer technologies, the onus falls on us to determine the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of these techniques, and to educate stakeholders on the efficient use and interpretation of the results for better patient care. Furthermore, we need to remain at the forefront of technology and understand the benefits and shortcomings to continue to improve the diagnosis and control of infectious diseases.",
