            "text": "The role of inter-facility patient transport (IFT) is constantly being extended and expanded especially in smaller scale local hospitals in Hong Kong. This trend can be explained by three reasons. Firstly, there is ongoing centralization of specialist services to tertiary centers and this reorganization of services increases demand for IFT. Secondly, the difficult first hand experience of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis sensitized all healthcare staff to the importance of maintaining strict infection control measures. Strict infection control policies have led to declines in both patient turnover and the capacities of the wards. This clinical framework further aggravated existing bed constraints and a high quality IFT service became a must. In addition, IFT also plays a role in supplementing the primary trauma diversion program as trauma patients who have airway or breathing compromise that cannot be overcome at the scene or in transit require stabilization in the nearest hospital (Cheung et al., 2006).",

However, the benefits of transport may outweigh the risks in some circumstances (for example, transfer to a vascular unit for surgery for ruptured aortic aneurysm) and this principle was essentially revealed by the guidelines written by American College of Critical Care Medicine Task Force (1993). A reliable communication system including physician-to-physician and/or nurse-to-nurse communication regarding patient\u2019s condition is also a fundamental principle of IFT (Tan, 1997, Warren et al., 2004). Documentation is vital in IFT not only for the quality of the transport, but also to minimize potential medico-legal issues including informed consent, a written plan from attending doctors and an en route observation record (Maxwell and Miller, 1988).",

Configurations can be nurse\u2013paramedic or physician\u2013nurse combination (Oakley, 1999, Blackwell, 2002, Barbara, 2003). Alternative personnel or specialized transport teams may be necessary depending on specific patient conditions (McGinn et al., 1996, Vos et al., 2004). There is still no worldwide accepted standard for assigning accompanying personnel for IFT (Markakis et al., 2006). In Hong Kong, training for IFT is not mandatory. This study did not show the significant relationship with training which is different from other studies (Tan, 1997, Blackwell, 2002, Uusaro et al., 2002). Nevertheless, training is still to be recommended for frontline staff in order to enhance and enforce their skills in an unfamiliar prehospital environment \u2013 the noisy, vibrating and bumpy ambulance (American College of Emergency Physicians, 1990, Australasian College for Emergency Medicine, 2003).",
