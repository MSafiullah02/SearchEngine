            "text": "With the exception of clean water, vaccines have been the most effective modalities in reducing human mortality from infectious diseases. With an effective vaccine, the World Health Organization (WHO) was able to declare the complete eradication of smallpox around the world in the 1970s. Similarly, the world is now almost free of polio, with the exception of only six countries (CDC). Effective vaccines have been successfully developed for some pathogens. However, lack of effective vaccines for others [e.g., the Bacilli\u2010Calette\u2010Guerin (BCG)\u2010based vaccine for tuberculosis] and the emergence of new pathogens (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] virus) warrant continuous effort in vaccine development. In addition, the recent bioterror threat makes it more urgent to develop new or alternative vaccines for those pathogens that can be potentially used for bioterror purposes.",

            "text": "Vaccines are traditionally prepared with either live attenuated or killed bacteria or viruses. In many cases, these approaches have proven to be successful. Vaccines based on live attenuated or killed pathogens are usually very potent and can induce all aspects of immune responses. However, serious safety concerns may preclude the use of these approaches in the development of vaccines for some pathogens such as HIV (Baba et al., 1999). New generation vaccines, such as recombinant protein\u2010based vaccines, synthetic peptide\u2010based vaccines, lipid\u2010based vaccines/antigens, and vaccines based on polysaccharides, are thought to be potentially safer than traditional vaccines. Unfortunately, these new generation vaccines are often very poorly immunogenic, partially because the components having adjuvant activity were discarded in the purification or synthesis process. Some less or well defined structures of pathogens, such as bacterial cell wall components, unmethylated DNA, or double\u2010stranded (ds) RNA, may activate the host defense system by acting as potent \u201cdanger\u201d signals. Elimination of these components leads to poor immunogenicity. The reduced or lack of ability for some new generation vaccines to induce a cell\u2010mediated immune (CMI) response, especially a cytotoxic T lymphocyte response (CTL), is another limitation. For example, a recombinant protein\u2010based vaccine elicits mainly humoral immune response (i.e., IgG and IgE production) if administered without proper adjuvants. The polysaccharide vaccine, without conjugation to an appropriate carrier protein, generates only a T cell independent (TI) response by the production of IgM (Lesinski and Westerink, 2001). Importantly, it is currently believed that CMI, especially the CTL response, is as critical as neutralizing antibodies for the effective control of intracellular pathogens such as HIV, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and malaria. In case of tumor vaccines, the ability to induce a tumor\u2010specific CTL response is thought to be indispensable for them to be effective. Therefore, the discovery in the early 1990s that a vaccine based on plasmid DNA can induce both humoral and cellular immune responses produced great excitement in the vaccine and immunology community.",

In 1994 the WHO chose the term nucleic acid vaccine, subtermed into the DNA vaccine and RNA vaccine. The DNA vaccine was based on the finding that administration of recombinant plasmid DNA into an animal resulted in the expression of a foreign protein encoded by the plasmid (Wolff et al., 1990). Soon after this initial finding, Tang et al. (1992) for the first time demonstrated the elicitation of an immune response against a foreign protein by introducing a plasmid encoding the interesting antigen protein directly into mouse skin with a gene gun. Then, almost simultaneously, Ulmer 1993, Fynan 1993 showed that immunization with plasmid DNA could protect mice against a lethal influenza challenge. Subsequently, thousands of papers have been published demonstrating that the DNA vaccine is potentially effective for a wide variety of diseases, including infectious diseases, cancers, autoimmune diseases, and allergic diseases.",

It is relatively more stable and potentially more cost\u2010effective for manufacture and storage. Also, multiple antigens may be combined into one plasmid to target multiple pathogens or multiple components of a single pathogen. In addition, the unmethylated CpG motifs on bacterial plasmid DNA in the context of flanking sequences have proven to be immunostimulatory by acting as a pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) molecule and interacting with the Toll\u2010like receptor 9 (TLR9) (Akira et al., 2001). However, the DNA vaccine does have limitations. Specifically, the DNA vaccine tends to be relatively poorly immunogenic, often requiring a large dose to be effective. Since its discovery in the early 1990s, the DNA vaccine has mainly been administered by either intramuscular (im) injection of naked plasmid DNA or by gene gun\u2010mediated administration (i.e., ballistic penetration of pDNA adsorbed on gold beads into skin). Intramuscular injection has proven to be very effective in small animal models. However, the effectiveness of the DNA vaccine in nonhuman primates and humans in recent studies has not been encouraging, especially in eliciting an antibody response (Calarota 2001, Conry 2002, Klencke 2002, Le 2000, Mincheff 2000, Rosenberg 2003, Tacket 1999, Tagawa 2003, Timmerman 2002, Wang 1998, Weber 2001). Gene gun\u2010mediated administration resulted in a better immune response than an intramuscular injection in clinical trials (Roy et al., 2000). However, the administration of gold beads into humans might be problematic in long term.",

            "text": "The outcome of an immune response is determined partially by how the antigen is presented by the APCs to the T and B cells, exogenously or endogenously. For a live vaccine such as the live viral vaccine, the virus is still infectious to the host cells, including APCs. The relevant antigen is produced by the host cells. Therefore, the antigen is generated inside the cells (endogenously) and is processed by the proteosome apparatus into small peptides, which are then transferred into the endoplasmic reticulum where they can bind to the newly synthesized MHC class I molecules (Harding and Song, 1994). The MHC class I molecule with peptide epitope on its groove is mobilized onto the cell surface where it may be recognized by antigen\u2010specific CD8+ T cells with the appropriate TCR. This endogenous presentation results in a CTL immune response. The fact that a DNA vaccine may elicit a CTL immune response is also due to the endogenous presentation of the encoding antigen. However, for the nonlive vaccine, such as the protein (subunit)\u2010based vaccine, the antigen is taken up by APCs in the intercellular spaces by endocytosis. In this pathway, the antigen is processed inside the endosome and lysosome. Some of the endosomal proteolytic degradation products will occupy the epitope groove of the class II MHC molecule and be transported to the extracellular surface of the APCs. This class II MHC molecule, together with the epitope, will be available for recognition by CD4+ T cells. The CD4+ T cells may develop into either Th1 type or Th2 type cells. The Th1 cell and its related cytokines [interleukin\u20102 (IL\u20102), interferon\u2010\u03b3 (IFN\u2010\u03b3), etc.] help initiate CMI, whereas the Th2 helper and its related cytokines (IL\u20104, IL\u201010, etc.) direct a humoral immune response (Castellino et al., 1997).",

            "text": "As mentioned earlier, for the DNA vaccine, plasmid DNA has primarily been administered by either im injection or via the gene gun into skin. It was found that gene expression from the administered plasmid was predominantly in the myoblasts after im injection and in the keratinocytes and fibroblasts after gene gun\u2010mediated administration. These patterns of expression raised questions on how the expressed antigen is presented to T cells. Although myoblasts and keratinocytes express MHC class I molecules, they do not express other secondary signal molecules (e.g., CD 80 and CD 86). Therefore, theoretically, presentation of expressed antigen by these nonprofessional cells is more likely to tolerize than stimulate T cells. In addition, experiments carried out by Iwasaki et al. (1997) and Corr et al. (1996) clearly ruled out the possibility that the somatic cells (transfected with plasmid expressing the antigen only) directly presented antigens to the T cells. In the study by Corr et al. (1996), parent\u2192F1 bone marrow chimeras, in which H\u20102bxd recipient mice received bone marrow that expressed only H\u20102b or H\u20102d MHC molecules, were injected (im) with naked plasmid DNA encoding the nucleoprotein from the A/PR/8/34 influenza strain, which has epitopes for both H\u20102Db and H\u20102Kd on a single antigen. The resulting CTL responses were restricted to the MHC haplotype of the bone marrow alone and not to the other haplotype expressed by the myocytes of the recipient (Corr et al., 1996). These results showed that dendritic cells and other APCs that are differentiated from bone marrow cells, instead of somatic cells, were responsible for antigen presentation. This may explain why intradermal gene gun injection often induced better immune responses than im injection. The gene gun may target DCs in the viable skin epidermis more effectively and directly, resulting in a very potent immune response. Moreover, significantly less DNA is required to elicit an immune response by the gene gun compared to im needle injection. Within the skin, there is a high population of immature DCs or LCs. In contrast, much fewer DCs exist in the muscle.",

            "text": "The first mechanism of the direct transfection of professional APCs and the presentation of the self\u2010expressed antigen by the APCs is easily understandable and has been well documented. It was reported that as few as 500 transfected mouse DCs are sufficient to successfully elicit an immune response (Takashima and Morita, 1999). Many experiments have also demonstrated the existence of cross\u2010priming. In cross\u2010priming, the antigen may be expressed by somatic cells transfected with the plasmid DNA. The antigen protein or peptide will then be picked up by professional APCs and presented to T cells. As aforementioned, the secreted or exogenous protein undergoes endocytosis or phagocytosis to enter the MHC class II antigen processing pathway to stimulate CD4+ T cells. Endogenously produced proteins are processed by the proteosome apparatus and are presented through the MHC class I pathway to stimulate naive CD8+ T cells. Although peptides derived from exogenous sources generally cannot be presented on MHC class I molecules, there are now many examples showing that this does occur if proper adjuvants or delivery systems are used (Falo 1995, Raychaudhuri 1998). During cross\u2010priming, the antigen or peptide (both MHC class I and II) generated by somatic cells (myocytes or keratinocytes) can be taken up by professional APCs to prime the T\u2010cell response. A study carried out by Ulmer et al. (1996) clearly demonstrated that cross\u2010priming from myocytes to APC happens. In their study, influenza NP\u2010expressing myoblasts (H\u20102k) were injected intraperitoneally into F1 hybrid mice (H\u20102dxk) (Ulmer et al., 1996). It was found that NP CTL restricted by the MHC haplotype of both parental strains was induced. H\u20102d\u2010restricted epitopes must have somehow found their way to move from the myoblasts to the H\u20102d\u2010expressing APCs. It is, of course, assumed that the very unlikely case of direct transfer of the NP expression plasmid from the myoblast to APC did not happen.",

In this case, the myoblast expresses both HIV\u20101 envelope protein and CD86. It is interesting to find that CD86 alone can provide the necessary secondary signal. Another study showed that the transfected fibroblasts are able to induce an antigen\u2010specific MHC class I\u2010restricted response if they are physically relocated to secondary lymphoid tissue (Kundig et al., 1995). In lymphoid tissues, a secondary signal may be provided by other cells to the fibroblasts. Thus, nonprofessional cells may be able to prime an immune response when the appropriate secondary signal is provided.",

Bacterial DNA was unknowingly used experimentally as a component of an adjuvant over 60 years when Freund used the whole mycobacterial extract as a major constituent in his adjuvant formula based on empirical results (Freund, 1951). It has been shown that the mycobacterial DNA in the Freund's adjuvant contributed to the adjuvant effect (Shimada 1985, Tokunaga 1984, Yamamoto 1988). Yamamoto et al. (1988) found that a purified nucleic acid fraction from the BCG vaccine has a limited antitumor activity that appears to be mediated through its ability to activate NK cells and to induce the production of interferon. Treatment of this fraction with DNase substantially reduced this activity (Tokunaga et al., 1999). This confirmed the immunostimulatory property of mycobacterial DNA. It is now known that the unmethylated CpG motif with its flanking sequences, even in the form of oligonucleotide, is strongly immunostimulatory (Klinman 1999, Krieg 1995).",

It was later found to also play a crucial role in antifungal defense, together with other antimicrobial peptides (Lemaitre et al., 1996). In the 1990s, the first mammalian protein structurally related to Drosophila Toll was identified and is now called the human Toll\u2010like receptor (Medzhitov et al., 1997). To date, 10 human and 9 murine transmembrane proteins have been shown to belong to the mammalian TLR family (Akira 2001, Zarember 2002).

            "text": "Different TLRs can exert distinct, but overlapping, sets of biological effects, and increasing evidence indicates that this can be attributed to both common and unique aspects of the signaling mechanisms. All functional studies characterize the TLR signal via the TLR/IL\u20101 receptor pathway because the presence of the TIR domain can interact with the adaptor protein MyD88. The adaptor molecule MyD88 is recruited to the receptor complex, followed by engagement of the IL\u20101R\u2010associated kinases (IRAK). IRAK1 and IRAK4 are serine\u2010threonine kinases involved in the phosphorylation and activation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor\u2010associated factor 6 (TRAF6) (Medzhitov 1998, Muzio 1998, Wesche 1997). In contrast, IRAK\u2010M lacks kinase activity and regulates TLR signaling negatively by preventing the dissociation of phosphorylated IRAK1 and IRAK4 from MyD88. Phosphorylated TRAF6 leads to the activation of downstream kinases, such as the stress kinase JNK1/2 and the I\u03baB kinase (IKK) complex (Baud et al., 1999). This event frees nuclear factor\u2010\u03baB (NF\u2010\u03baB) from I\u03baB and allows its nuclear translocation and the subsequent transcriptional activation of many proinflammatory genes, which encode cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and immune receptors. All of these molecules are involved in engaging and controlling the innate immune response and in orchestrating the transition to an adaptive immune response (Medzhitov, 2001).",

Clonal T\u2010cell expansion requires an additional signal delivered by costimulatory molecules such as CD80/86.

The interaction of CpG motifs with TLR9 was further confirmed by the fact that in TLR9 knockout mice, all CpG DNA\u2010induced effects, including cytokine production, B\u2010cell proliferation, and DC maturation, were completely abolished (Hemmi et al., 2000). In fact, the immunostimulatory effect of CpG motif is so strong that CpG motifs containing oligonucleotides are now being used as a vaccine adjuvant. In tumor vaccine development, the CpG motif is an adjuvant of special interest, as generally, the CpG motif can skew the immune response to be Th1 biased, which favors the induction of CTL for tumor killing. However, caution needs to be applied in the repeated administration of CpG motifs. Heikenwalder et al. (2004) reported that repeated CpG oligodeoxynucleotide administration led to lymphoid follicle destruction and immunosuppression (Heikenwalder et al., 2004). They reported that daily intraperitoneal injection of 60 \u03bcg CpG\u2010ODN dramatically alters the morphology and functionality of mouse lymphoid organs. By day 7, lymphoid follicles were poorly defined; follicular dendritic cells and germinal center B lymphocytes were suppressed. Accordingly, CpG\u2010ODN treatment for more than 7 days strongly reduced the primary humoral immune response and immunoglobulin class switching. By day 20, mice developed multifocal liver necrosis and hemorrhagic ascites. Of course, it is very unlikely for anybody to develop a vaccine that contains so many CpG motifs and to administer it daily for up to 7\u201320 days intraperitoneally. The finding is mentioned here simply to point out that high doses of CpG motifs could be potentially toxic.",

Meanwhile, many other routes have been tried. These include subcutaneous injection, intradermal injection, noninvasive topical application onto the skin (Tang et al., 1997), intranasal and intravaginal applications (Livingston 1998, Park 2003), and vaccination via oral mucosa or gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa (oral). Depending on the route, different immune responses have been elicited. For example, due to the fact that most of the pathogens enter the host through either the mucosal surface or the skin, an immune response that can neutralize or kill the pathogens on the mucosal surface prior to their entrance is therefore desired. Also, due to the common mucosal system, dosing of vaccine from one mucosal site (e.g., nasal) may lead to a mucosal response on another mucosal site (e.g., vaginal) (McGhee et al., 1992). To achieve a mucosal immune response, the DNA vaccine has been applied on the nasal, oral, GI, or vaginal mucosal surface with specially designed devices or delivery systems. The following paragraphs provide a few examples for administration of the DNA vaccine by mucosal routes.",

In addition, a high density of T cells and mucosal\u2010associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) are present in the buccal mucosa. Therefore, immunization via the buccal mucosa may represent an attractive mucosal immunization approach. In fact, the efficacy of oral buccal mucosal DNA immunization has been confirmed by many using transepithelial needle injection, jet injection, or gene gun. For example, Lundholm et al. (1999) found that jet injection of plasmid DNA into the oral cheek of mice induced a very strong IgA mucosal response specific to the encoding HIV\u20101 proteins (gp160, p24, and TAT) (Lundholm et al., 1999). To avoid the inconvenience posed by those means of DNA administration, Cui and Mumper (2002a) developed a buccal mucoadhesive film based on polymers Noveon and Eudragit S\u2010100. When plasmid DNA (encoding \u03b2\u2010galactosidase protein as a model antigen)\u2010loaded film was applied to rabbit buccal mucosa, a serum\u2010specific IgG level comparable to that induced by a subcutaneous injection of aluminum hydroxide (Alum) adjuvanted \u03b2\u2010galactosidase protein was induced (Cui and Mumper, 2002a). In addition, strong serum IgA and splenocyte proliferative responses were induced. Although data are promising, application of vaccine on oral buccal mucosa has the limitation that tolerance instead of immunity might be very often induced. The buccal mucosa is in contact with many foreign antigens daily. However, rarely is an immune response induced.",

However, the polio vaccine is still the only marketed vaccine administered orally, perhaps illustrating the difficulty in developing an effective oral vaccine. The extensive enzymatic systems and harsh physical and chemical environments in the GI tract make it difficult to develop an active oral vaccine.

            "text": "Immunization with plasmid DNA can induce antibody responses in a variety of proteins in animal species, particularly in mouse. Moreover, the humoral response generated by DNA vaccination has been shown to be protective in several animal models in vivo. However, as detailed later, the antibody response in humans from the DNA vaccine has not been encouraging. The antibody response from the DNA vaccine is weak at the beginning then peaks and reaches a plateau between 1 and 3 months after a single DNA immunization in mice (Deck et al., 1997). Furthermore, within a certain dose range, antibody production is generally increased in a dose\u2010responsive manner with either a single injection or multiple injections of DNA by various routes of immunization (Deck et al., 1997). The resulting antibody response can be long lived (e.g., significant serum levels were present up to 1.5 years after vaccination) (Deck 1997, Raz 1994). Unfortunately, when antibody responses from DNA, protein, and live virus vaccines were compared, the response from the DNA vaccine is generally weaker than that from protein\u2010based vaccine and that from the liver virus vaccine. For example, in a study comparing the antibody responses to DNA encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen and live influenza infection, the antibody titer in mice vaccinated with live influenza was significantly higher than that in DNA\u2010vaccinated mice (Deck et al., 1997). In comparing the antibody responses elicited by vaccination with DNA encoding a malarial surface protein and the protein itself, both antibody titers and avidity were significantly lower in mice vaccinated with DNA than in those vaccinated with the protein (Kang et al., 1998). In contrast, in one study directly comparing the kinetics of an antibody response after vaccination with DNA\u2010encoding ovalbumin (OVA) and OVA protein, there did not appear to be a difference in total OVA\u2010specific antibody production at 2 or 4 weeks postvaccination when DNA was administered intradermally (Boyle et al., 1997). In this study, antibody induced by DNA had a higher avidity than that induced by protein. It is worthwhile to point out that many parameters can affect the results from these comparisons. First of all, it is difficult to choose the doses of DNA and protein to compare. Therefore, one has to compare the highest antibody response from the DNA vaccine with the highest antibody response from other vaccines. Second, it is well known that when a protein is injected alone, usually no or very weak immune responses will be induced. Thus, an adjuvant such as Alum is often used. In the case of the DNA vaccine, intramuscular injection of \u201cnaked\u201d DNA alone can lead to an antibody response. Third, the adjuvant or delivery system makes a difference in terms of the resulting responses. For example, previous studies found that the antibody response from the DNA vaccine was weaker than that from a protein\u2010based vaccine adjuvanted with Alum when the DNA vaccine is administered as a \u201cnaked\u201d unformulated plasmid. However, when the plasmid is formulated with nanoparticles as the carrier, the resulting antibody response was then stronger than that from the same protein\u2010based vaccine (Cui and Mumper, 2002b). Finally, the route of administration has a significant effect. As mentioned earlier, when plasmid DNA was applied to rabbit buccal mucosa via the mucoadhensive films we developed, a strong antibody response was observed. However, when the protein antigen encoded by the plasmid was applied to rabbits in the same route with the same device, no detectable antibody response was induced (Cui and Mumper, 2002a). Therefore, caution should be applied when carrying out these comparisons. However, in general, especially in clinical trials, the antibody response from the DNA vaccine is not encouraging.",

Moreover, in most cases, antibodies generated by DNA vaccines are skewed toward IgG2a due to the fact that the CpG motifs on plasmid DNA stimulate production of the Th1 cytokine. However, exceptions do exist because DNA vaccination with a gene gun on skin was preferentially bias toward IgG1 production (Feltquate et al., 1997). One reason to explain this is that when the DNA vaccine is administrated via the gene gun on skin, the DNA dose is much lower than in the case of intramuscular injection. Therefore, there may not be a sufficient amount of CpG motifs being administered. This has yet to be confirmed.",

However, in other studies, plasmid DNA encoding a nucleoprotein of the LCMV virus administered intramuscularly failed to give appreciable antibody responses before viral challenge (Deck et al., 1997).

Also, the presence of Th1 cytokines facilitates the differentiation of CD4+ T cells toward a Th1 phenotype and prevents the development of Th2, whereas the presence of Th2 cytokines allows for Th2 differentiation and prevents the differentiation of Th1 T cells. CD4+ T cells can mediate at least three major functions. (1) Activated CD4+ T cells promote B\u2010cell survival and antibody production (Banchereau et al., 1994). (2) CD4+ T cells, through production of IL\u20102 and/or through CD40L\u2010CD40 costimulation, provide helper function to CD8+ T cells (Bennett 1998, Ridge 1998, Schoenberger 1998).

Also, the DNA vaccine has been used to treat allergy, which is associated with a high\u2010level production of the IgE antibody and Th2 cytokines. For example, Roy et al.

Mice receiving chitosan\u2010encapsulated DNA containing a dominant peanut allergen gene (pCMVArah2) produced secretory IgA and serum IgG2a (Roy et al., 1999).

Although the CTL response can also be induced by a live vaccine, it is difficult to induce with a protein\u2010based vaccine. Of course, with a proper delivery system such as particles, a protein\u2010based vaccine occasionally induces a CTL response (Falo et al., 1995). Depending on the disease models used, the magnitude of the CTL response from the DNA vaccine is, in most cases, comparable to that from a live viral vaccine. Also, the DNA vaccine can induce a CTL response against both dominant and subdominant epitopes. This may be useful for the development of a DNA vaccine for tumor immunotherapy. In their development process, tumor cells often become tolerated to the CTL response against the dominant epitopes of tumor\u2010specific or tumor\u2010associated antigens. Therefore, successful induction of CTL responses to the subdominant epitopes on these antigens should be helpful for tumor killing.",

            "text": "The first human trial of the DNA vaccine for the treatment of HIV infection was reported by MacGregor et al. (1998). In their study, a DNA\u2010based vaccine encoding HIV\u20101 env and rev genes was tested for safety and host immune response in 15 asymptomatic HIV\u2010infected patients. Successive groups received three doses of vaccine intramuscularly (30, 100, or 300 \u03bcg) at 10\u2010week intervals in a dose\u2010escalation trial. The vaccine induced no local or systemic reactions, and no laboratory abnormalities were detected. Specifically, no patient developed anti\u2010DNA antibody or showed muscle enzyme elevations. No consistent change occurred in CD4 or CD8 lymphocyte counts or in plasma HIV concentration. Antibody against gp120 increased in individual patients in the 100\u2010 and 300\u2010\u03bcg groups. Some increases were noted in CTL activity against gp160\u2010bearing targets and in lymphocyte proliferative activity. For the 100\u2010\u03bcg treatment, ELISA showed that binding of antisera from the subjects to gp120 was increased significantly after vaccination. When the binding of pre\u2010 and postvaccination antisera against a V3 loop peptide derived from gp130MN was measured, an enhancement of binding (at 1:4500 dilution) of 47.6% 8\u2010week postvaccination was observed. These data demonstrated that the DNA vaccine boosted the antibody response in humans. In case of cellular immune responses, some changes were noted in CTL activity against gp160\u2010bearing targets. Enhanced specific lymphocyte proliferative activity against the HIV\u20101 envelope was observed in multiple patients. The majority of patients who exhibited an increase in any immune parameters were within the 300\u2010\u03bcg dose group, the group with the highest dose. In at least one of multiple assays, the six subjects who received the 300\u2010\u03bcg dose had DNA vaccine\u2010induced antigen\u2010specific lymphocyte proliferative responses and antigen\u2010specific production of both IFN\u2010\u03b3 and \u03b2\u2010chemokine. Furthermore, four of five subjects in the 300\u2010\u03bcg dose group responded to both rev and env components of the vaccine. The responses did not persist within inoculated individuals and scored in different individuals at different times in the trial (Boyer 2000, MacGregor 1998, MacGregor 2000, MacGregor 2002, Ugen 1998). Taken together, these studies show that the safety profile for the DNA vaccine is excellent. Both humoral and cellular immune responses, including CTL, are inducible in humans. Also, the vaccine can stimulate multiple immune responses in vaccine\u2010naive subjects when multiple antigens were encoded in the plasmid DNA.",

The DNA vaccine was safe and did not induce anti\u2010DNA autoimmune antibodies. Vaccination had no long\u2010term effects on the CD4+/CD8+ lymphocyte counts, plasma HIV\u20101 RNA concentrations, or disease progression. However, anti\u2010gp120 and anti\u2010gp160 antibody titers did not change significantly over a time period of 28 weeks and did not increase in response to vaccination compared to the baseline value. In other words, this DNA vaccination did not cause any significant antibody response (Weber et al., 2001). Calarota et al. (2001), however, reported that vaccination with a gene combination raised a broad HIV\u2010specific CTL response (Calarota et al., 2001). In their trial, the efficacy of a combination of DNA plasmids encoding the nef, rev, and tat HIV\u20101 regulatory genes in inducing cellular immune responses was analyzed in asymptomatic HIV\u20101\u2010infected patients. Patients initially selected for having low or no detectable immune responses to Nef, Rev, or Tat antigens developed MHC class I\u2010restricted cytolytic activities as well as enhanced bystander effects. The most remarkable change observed after immunization with the gene combination was an increase in CTL precursors to target T cells infected with the whole HIV\u20101 genome (Calarota et al., 2001). An in vitro assessment of the expression of single and combined gene products showed that this was consistent with the induction of CTL responses in vivo.",

            "text": "Malaria is an increasingly uncontrolled public health problem; 1\u20133 million people die annually from Plasmodium falciparum infection. A preventative vaccine is likely to be among the most effective means for its control. In 1998, Wang and colleagues reported the induction of antigen\u2010specific CTL responses in humans by a malaria DNA vaccine. In their study, 20 healthy adult volunteers were enrolled in a phase I safety and tolerability clinical study of a DNA vaccine encoding a malaria antigen. Volunteers received three intramuscular injections of one of four different dosages (20, 100, 500, and 2500 \u03bcg) of the P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) encoding plasmid DNA at monthly intervals and were followed for up to 12 months. Local reactogenicity and systemic symptoms were few and mild. There were no severe or serious adverse events, clinically significant biochemical or hematologic changes, or detectable anti\u2010DNA antibodies. The volunteers developed antigen\u2010specific, genetically restricted, CD8+ T\u2010cell\u2010dependent CTLs. Responses were directed against all 10 peptides tested and were restricted by six human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) class I alleles. This was the first demonstration in healthy na\u00efve humans of the induction of CD8+ CTLs by a DNA vaccine, including CTLs, that were restricted by multiple HLA alleles in the same individual. However, very disappointingly, despite the induction of excellent CTL responses, the DNA vaccination failed to induce detectable antigen\u2010specific antibodies in any of the volunteers (Le 2000, Wang 1998). More recently, this group reported that patients who received the PfCSP DNA vaccine followed by a recombinant protein vaccine have antibody and CD8+ and CD4+ T\u2010cell responses, suggesting that this heterologous prime\u2010boosting approach might be viable (Epstein 2004, Wang 2004a). Hill and colleagues at the University of Oxford approached this by alternative dosing with a DNA vaccine and recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) (McConkey 2003, Moorthy 2003). They showed that a heterologous prime\u2010boost vaccination regime of DNA either intramuscularly or epidermally, followed by intradermal recombinant MVA, induces high frequencies of IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010secreting, antigen\u2010specific T\u2010cell responses in humans to a preerythrocytic malaria antigen, thrombospondin\u2010related adhesion protein (TRAP). These responses are 5\u2010 to 10\u2010fold higher than the T\u2010cell responses induced by the DNA vaccine or recombinant MVA vaccine alone and produce partial protection manifest as delayed parasitemia after sporozoite challenge with a different strain of P. falciparum. DNA ME\u2010TRAP and MVA ME\u2010TRAP are safe and immunogenic for effector and memory T\u2010cell induction. MVA ME\u2010TRAP, with or without prior DNA ME\u2010TRAP immunization, was more immunogenic and more cross\u2010reactive in malaria\u2010exposed individuals than in malaria\u2010naive individuals. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were induced by these vaccines (McConkey 2003, Moorthy 2003).",

The prostate\u2010specific membrane antigen (PSMA) was used as the tumor antigen. Immunizations included extracellular human PSMA DNA as well as human CD86 DNA into separate expression vectors (PSMA and CD86 plasmids) and into a combined PSMA/CD86 plasmid. In addition, the PSMA gene was inserted into a replication\u2010deficient adenoviral expression vector. Twenty\u2010six patients with prostate cancer were entered into a phase I/II toxicity\u2010dose escalation study. Immunizations were performed intradermally at weekly intervals. Doses of DNA between 100 and 800 \u03bcg and of recombinant virus at 5 \u00d7 108 PFUs per application were used. They found no immediate or long\u2010term side effects following immunizations. All patients who received the initial inoculation with the viral vector followed by PSMA plasmid boosts showed signs of immunization, as evidenced by the development of a delayed\u2010type hypersensitivity reaction after the PSMA plasmid injection. In contrast, of the patients who received a PSMA plasmid and CD86 plasmid, only 50% showed signs of successful immunization. Of the patients who received PSMA plasmid and soluble granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony\u2010stimulating factor (GM\u2010CSF), 67% were immunized. However, all patients who received the PSMA/CD86 plasmid and soluble GM\u2010CSF became immunized. Patients who did not immunize during the first round were later successfully immunized after a boost with the viral vector. The heterogeneity of the medical status and the presence of concomitant hormone therapy in many patients did not permit unequivocal interpretation of data with respect to the effectiveness of the therapy. However, several responders, as evidenced by a change in the local disease, distant metastases, and PSA levels, were identified.",

CEA was selected as a prototypic tumor\u2010associated self\u2010antigen, and the HBsAg cDNA was included as a positive control for an immune response to the DNA vaccine without relying on breaking tolerance to a self\u2010antigen. Groups of 3 patients received escalating single im doses of the DNA vaccine at 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg. Subsequent groups of 3 patients received three repetitive 0.3\u2010 or 1.0\u2010mg doses at 3\u2010week intervals. A final group of 2 patients received three repetitive 2.0\u2010mg doses at 3\u2010week intervals. Toxicity was limited to transient grade 1 injection site tenderness, fatigue, and creatine kinase elevations, each affecting a minority of patients in a nondose\u2010related manner. Repetitive dosing of the DNA vaccine induced HBsAg antibodies in 6 out of 8 patients, with protective antibody levels achieved in 4 of these patients. Although 4 of 17 patients developed lymphoproliferative responses to CEA after vaccination, CEA\u2010specific antibody responses were not observed in any subject, echoing the results from other human clinical trials mentioned earlier. Also, this study shows that the antibody response is dependent on the antigen used. HBsAg is known to be very antigenic. This is probably why anti\u2010HBsAg Ab was detected in all patients while anti\u2010CEA Ab was not detected in any individual. No objective clinical responses to a DNA vaccine were observed among this population of patients with widely metastatic colorectal carcinoma.",

B\u2010cell lymphomas express tumor\u2010specific immunoglobulin, the variable regions of which [idiotype (Id)] can serve as a target for active immunotherapy. The safety and immunogenicity of naked DNA Id vaccine in 12 patients with follicular B\u2010cell lymphoma were investigated. The DNA encoded a chimeric immunoglobulin molecule containing variable heavy and light chain immunoglobulin sequences derived from each patient's tumor, linked to the IgG2a and \u03ba mouse immunoglobulin (MsIg) heavy and light chain constant region chains, respectively. Patients in remission after chemotherapy received three monthly im injections of the DNA in three dose\u2010escalation cohorts of 4 patients each (200, 600, and 1800 \u03bcg). After vaccination, 7 of 12 patients mounted either humoral (n = 4) or T\u2010cell\u2010proliferative (n = 4) responses to the MsIg component of the vaccine. In one patient, a T\u2010cell response specific to autologous Id was also measurable. A second series of vaccinations were then administered using a needle\u2010free injection device (Biojector) to deliver 1800 \u03bcg both im and intradermally (id); 9 of 12 patients had humoral (n = 6) and/or T\u2010cell (n = 4) responses to MsIg. Six of 12 patients exhibited humoral and/or T\u2010cell anti\u2010Id responses; however, these were cross\u2010reactive with Id proteins from other patient's tumors. Subsequently, a third series of vaccinations were carried out using 500 \u03bcg of human granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony\u2010stimulating factor DNA mixed with 1800 \u03bcg of Id DNA. The proportion of patients responding to MsIg remained essentially unchanged (8 of 12), although humoral or T\u2010cell responses were boosted in some cases.

            "text": "Similar to gene therapy, there is widespread concern that plasmid DNA might integrate into the host genome and increase the chance of malignant transformation, genomic instability, or cell growth dysregulation. However, for many years, the integration of plasmid DNA in host genome was not reported, making it difficult to reach a regulatory consensus concerning the magnitude to the problem (Gurunathan et al., 2000). It is well known that it is not technically easy to remove free plasmid DNA from the host genomic DNA. Wang et al. (2004b) clearly showed the integration of plasmid DNA into mouse genome, especially after intramuscular DNA electroporation (Wang et al., 2004b). For needle\u2010injected mice, only about 17 copies of plasmid DNA were detected in 1 \u03bcg of genomic DNA. This agrees well with previous reports. It was indicated early that 3\u201330 copies of a DNA vaccine plasmid were associated with host genomic DNA 2 months after intramuscular needle injection (Ledwith 2000, Martin 1999). The calculated mutation rate from 3 to 30 copies per genome is 3000 times lower than the spontaneous mutation rate of 10\u22125 per cell. However, because the plasmid DNA copies in genome DNA were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), PCR may not be able to detect all the integrations such as those short fragments. In addition, the effect from the integration of long stretches of plasmid DNA containing strong regulatory sequences might be more significant than that from the small spontaneous point mutations.",

Electroporation increased the plasmid tissue level by approximately 34\u2010fold. Using a quantitative gel purification assay for integration, electroporation was found to markedly increase the level of plasmid associated with genomic DNA. To confirm the integration and to identify the insertion sites, Wang et al. (2004b) developed a new assay referred to as repeat\u2010anchored integration capture (RAIC) PCR, which is capable of detecting rare integration events in a complex mixture in vivo. Using this assay, they identified four independent integration events. Sequencing of the insertion sites suggested a random integration process, but with short segments of homology between the vector breakpoint and the insertion site in three of the four cases. This highlights the dilemma scientists are facing. Ways to improve the efficiency of the DNA vaccine such as electroporation might at the same time increase the risk (integration) of the DNA vaccine. Therefore, it is necessary to continue monitoring the integration rate of the DNA administration approaches prior to entrance into a human clinical trial.",

Neonatally tolerized animals were unable to mount antibody, cytokine, or cytotoxic responses when rechallenged with the DNA vaccine in vitro or in vivo. Tolerance was specific for immunogenic epitopes expressed by the vaccine\u2010encoded, endogenously produced antigen. This confirmed that in neonatals, an endogenously presented antigen from the DNA vaccine might be viewed by the neonatal as self. However, further studies pointed out that whether tolerance or immunity will develop is dependent on many parameters, such as dose, recipient's age, and the nature of antigen (Ichino et al., 1999). For example, for influenza, rabies, and HBV, no tolerance was observed, even in neonatals. Finally, a decreased response was also observed in aged mice (over 2 years old), suggesting that the DNA vaccine might be not effective in elderly people (Bender et al., 1998). This is probably due to the generally weaker immune system in elderly people.",
