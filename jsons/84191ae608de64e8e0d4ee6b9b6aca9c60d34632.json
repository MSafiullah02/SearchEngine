In these backcross progeny, one-half of the mice are resistant to CNS challenge with JHM (Table 2) . We can reject the two-recessive gene model (X 2 = 9.7 I, P < .005) and the data are consistent with the prediction of a one-dominant/one-recessive model (Z 2 = .03, .9 > P > .7). The simple one-to-one segregation in the backcross to SJL argues strongly against a model of a single gene with variable penetranee, and in favor of a two-gene model.

This finding argues against predominant effects of H-2 on resistance to fatal disease. The lack of a strong H-2 effect is consistent with our inability to transfer protection from old to young SJL mice by T cells (Stohlman, unpublished observations) , as would be expected if a classical lr gene were operating in a conventional manner. In addition, no obvious linkage with the coat color loci, a (agouti), c (albino), orp (pink-eyed, dilute), were seen.",

            "text": "Classically, genetic resistance to virus disease has been interpreted in two ways. Most dominant genes are assumed to function as do H-2-1inked immune response genes. For example, resistance to Cross-virus leukemia leukemogenesis is apparently identical to an H-2-1inked Ir gene (LiUy and Pincus 1973). Recessively inherited resistance genes have been interpreted as nonpermissiveness for viral replication. Bang and his coworkers showed that MHV could replicate in macrophages derived from susceptible, but not resistant, mouse strains (Bang and Warwick 1960) . Another example of recessively inherited resistance would be host-range mutants of Rous sarcoma virus, which, because of altered virus glycoprotein, cannot adsorb to the host cell and so do not replicate in cells which lack the appropriate virus receptors on their surfaces (Mason and Yeater 1977) . Recessive inheritance, however, does not rule out lack of immune etiology. The work of Oldstone and his colleagues (1973) in the LCM systern has shown an unusual twist. In this case, they proposed that mice which are resistant to fatal disease are resistant because they failed to produce an appropriate immune response, and so do not surfer the consequences of the immune-mediated process. Genetic results themselves can never completely unravel the mechanism of resistance. They can only provide limitations on the possible mechanisms. Our own preliminary investigations into the immunobiology of SJL resistance to JHM have suggested that neither T nor B lymphocytes can mediate this protection. Rather, it is mediated by cells which have neither T nor B cell surface markers, but are adherent to Sephadex G-10, and are therefore probably macrophage-like cells.",
