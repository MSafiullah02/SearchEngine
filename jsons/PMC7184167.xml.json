Nucleoside transporter inhibitor was unable to block the killing effect of SSK1 indicating that SSK1 entered the senescent cells independent of transporter (Supplementary information, Fig. S1e). We also validated that the prodrug SSK1 was specifically cleaved to release cytotoxic gemcitabine in senescent cells but not in non-senescent cells (Fig. 1c; Supplementary information, Fig. S1d). These results suggested that SSK1 was toxic to senescent cells and non-toxic to non-senescent cells.",

We found that SSK1 selectively and potently eliminated \u03b2-gal-positive senescent cells within a wide therapeutic window (Fig. 1d; Supplementary information, Fig. S1f\u2013i). Since SSK1 was cleaved into 4-(hydroxymethyl)-2-nitrophenol and gemcitabine in senescent cells, as a control, the hydrolyzed product of SSK1 \u2014 4-(hydroxymethyl)-2-nitrophenol showed no obvious toxicity to senescent and non-senescent cells (Supplementary information, Fig. S1j), and gemcitabine killed both cells at the similar concentration (Fig. 1a). To address whether SSK1 cleared senescent cells through \u03b2-gal rather than the higher metabolic rates in senescent cells, we tested another gemcitabine-based prodrug (LY2334737) lacking the galactose moiety and found no obvious difference in the elimination of senescent cells and non-senescent cells (Supplementary information, Fig. S1k). We further used RNA interference to decrease the expression of GLB1, the gene encoding \u03b2-gal (Supplementary information, Fig. S1l).28 Knockdown of GLB1 reduced SA-\u03b2-gal activity (Supplementary information, Fig. S1m) and showed little effect on other senescence markers, such as p16, p21 and Il1\u03b1 (Supplementary information, Fig. S1n). More importantly, knockdown of GLB1 impaired the ability of SSK1 to kill SA-\u03b2-gal-positive senescent cells (Fig. 1e), suggesting that its specificity for senescent cells depended on lysosomal \u03b2-gal activity. Collectively, we leveraged lysosomal \u03b2-gal, one conserved characteristic of senescent cells to design a prodrug that specifically killed senescent cells.",

As gemcitabine has been reported to induce cell death through the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK),29,30 we examined the phosphorylation status of p38 MAPK and its upstream MKK3/MKK6 in SSK1-treated senescent cells by western blot.31,32 After SSK1 treatment, both p38 MAPK and MKK3/MKK6 were activated by phosphorylation in senescent cells (Fig. 1f; Supplementary information, Fig. S2a, b), indicating that SSK1 could be processed into gemcitabine in senescent cells and activated the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. This was further confirmed by the treatment of p38 MAPK inhibitors Birb796, SB203580, and SB202190, which impaired SSK1\u2019s ability to specifically kill senescent cells (Supplementary information, Fig. S2c). Thus, SSK1 killed senescent cells through the activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. We also found that SSK1 was able to induce mitochondrial DNA damage in senescent cells (Supplementary information, Fig. S2d), similar to the reported ganciclovir, which also belongs to the nucleoside analogs as gemcitabine.33 Additionally, flow cytometry analysis showed that SSK1 induced senescent cells into annexin V and propidium iodide double-positive cells, and western blot result showed SSK1 could activate caspase 3, which indicated that SSK1 killed senescent cells by inducing apoptosis (Fig. 1g; Supplementary information, Fig. S2b). These results suggested that our prodrug SSK1 was activated by lysosomal \u03b2-gal and selectively killed senescent cells through the activation of p38 MAPK and induction of apoptosis.",

Second, we found that SSK1 could selectively kill replication-induced senescent lung fibroblasts from adult mice compared with non-senescent counterparts (Fig. 2b). Third, to understand if there is any efficacy difference of SSK1 between species, we treated senescent human embryonic fibroblasts (HEFs) induced by different stimuli with SSK1. The results showed that SSK1 selectively cleared human senescent cells induced by different stresses in a dose-dependent manner, without an obvious effect on non-senescent counterparts (Fig. 2c; Supplementary information, Fig. S2e, f and Table S2). We also treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human preadipocytes with SSK1, and found that senescent cells were selectively killed by SSK1 when compared with their non-senescent counterparts (Fig. 2d; Supplementary information, Figs. S2g\u2013i and S3e). Collectively, our results showed that SSK1 selectively killed both mouse and human senescent cells in a cell type- and senescence stimulus-independent manner.",

Especially, exercise capacity and muscle strength measured by treadmill and grip strength respectively were significantly increased in SSK1-treated mice compared with vehicle-treated mice (Supplementary information, Fig. S4f, g). Additionally, SSK1 treatment showed a tendency to increase the survival rate (Supplementary information, Fig. S4h). These results suggested that SSK1-induced reduction of SA-\u03b2-gal-positive senescent cells provides a potential method to alleviate senescence-related lung injury.",

Additionally, SSK1 treatment in aged mice could down-regulate the gene signatures associated with senescence as shown by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) in both livers and kidneys (Fig. 4f, g).

We performed immunofluorescence analysis of F4/80-positive macrophages, and found that these cells accumulated in livers of aging mice and that SSK1 could attenuate the macrophage infiltration (Supplementary information, Fig. S6g). This could partially account for the decreased inflammatory cytokines in aged mice. The decline of macrophage accumulation was further confirmed by our RNA-seq data of livers analyzed by xCell (Supplementary information, Fig. S6h, i).47 Notably, these results were consistent with our findings in the lung injury model, in which a reduction of \u03b2-gal-positive macrophages was observed in lungs of the SSK1-treatd mice with a decrease of inflammatory factors (Supplementary information, Fig. S6j).

We found most \u03b2-gal-positive non-senescent cells were epithelium cells (Supplementary information, Fig. S10a, b), which contained Ki67-positive proliferating cells (Supplementary information, Fig. S10c). Notably, we found that only a few cells in the kidney were induced into apoptosis after SSK1 treatment (Supplementary information, Fig. S10d). Additionally, we found no obvious reduction of endogenous acidic \u03b2-gal-positive non-senescent cells after SSK1 treatment in the kidney and submandibular glands (Supplementary information, Fig. S11), further supporting the in vivo safety of SSK1 treatment. Collectively, our results suggested that SSK1-induced clearance of SA-\u03b2-gal-positive senescent cells to be a robust and safe approach to ameliorate age-related functional decline.",

The foundation of our prodrug strategy was to select a highly specific senescence marker and identify an appropriate potent drug to efficiently kill senescent cells. First, the elevated enzymatic activity of \u03b2-gal, a universal senescence biomarker both in vitro and in vivo,18,52 was utilized to direct the prodrug to specifically target senescent cells. Second, through the screening of hundreds of FDA-approved drugs, we found gemcitabine to be one of the most potent agents in killing non-dividing senescent cells (Fig. 1a; Supplementary information, Fig. S1b, c, and Table S1). In addition, gemcitabine is a widely used FDA-approved drug with proven safety and short plasma circulation time.25,26 Our designed prodrug SSK1 is activated to release gemcitabine selectively in senescent cells (Fig. 1c), following which senescent cells were effectively eliminated (Fig. 1d). Our further study showed that gemcitabine activates p38 to induce apoptosis in non-dividing senescent cell (Supplementary information, Fig. S2a, b). As a nucleoside analog, gemcitabine could kill senescent cells through inducing mitochondrial DNA damage (Supplementary information, Fig. S2d), similar to a reported nucleoside analog, Ganciclovir.33 These results demonstrated that prodrug SSK1 is superior to current reported senolytics in terms of design strategy and specificity.",

In this study, we compared SSK1 with other reported senolytics on HEFs, human preadipocytes and HUVECs, which were used to test senolytics. ABT263 (a classical anti-apoptosis BCL-2 inhibitor) eliminated senescent HEFs and HUVECs, but showed little effect on human preadipocytes (Supplementary information, Fig. S3b, f, j), which was also reported by other previous studies.12,13 The combination of dasatinib (a pan-tyrosine kinase inhibitor) and quercetin (a plant flavonoid) killed all three types of senescent cells in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary information, Fig. S3c, g, k), but had a high toxic effect on non-senescent cells in consistence with others\u2019 results.11,16,36 Another natural flavonoid fisetin, reported as a potential senotherapeutic agent,15 showed modest effect on eliminating senescent HEFs and preadipocytes even at higher concentrations (Supplementary information, Fig. S3d, h) which was comparable to other\u2019s results.54 Most importantly, SSK1 could overcome these limitations, including cell-type dependency, high toxicity on non-senescent cells, and low efficiency on senescent cells (Supplementary information, Fig. S3a, e, i).

Second, SSK1 could decrease the expression of SASP-associated genes in aged livers and kidneys and reduce chronic low-grade inflammation in the blood (Fig. 5a, b, e\u2013h). Third, SSK1 ameliorated the impaired motor function, balance, exhausted exercise, muscle strength, and spontaneous exploration in aged mice (Fig. 6a\u2013e).

Therefore, eliminating macrophage accumulation by SSK1 might reduce chronic inflammation and benefit aged organisms. In addition, activated macrophages play crucial roles in acute inflammation and cytokine storm,56 especially those induced by virus infection. During virus-induced acute inflammation, macrophages produce pro-inflammatory factors and trigger initiation of cytokine storms.57 For instance, the depletion of macrophages could protect mice from coronavirus-induced lethal infection.58 Accordingly, activated macrophages could be potential targets for treating acute inflammation and cytokine storms via SSK1.

            "text": "An understanding of the toxicological effects of SSK1 in vivo is critical to clinical applications. Importantly, our data showed that high concentration (100 mg/kg) and high frequency SSK1 treatment had no apparent systemic toxicities (Supplementary information, Fig. S9). This provides strong evidence for the in vivo safety of SSK1. This safety profile is further supported by comparison to gemcitabine, an SSK1 effector and approved clinical drug. First, our effective in vivo dosage of SSK1 was approximately 60-fold lower than the clinical dosage of gemcitabine (30 mg/kg) and implies a greatly reduced risk of in vivo toxicity of SSK1.24 Second, gemcitabine is a nucleoside analog that potently affects rapidly dividing cells and the off-target effects of gemcitabine could be shown in different proliferating cell types.59,60 SSK1, however, targets only \u03b2-gal-positive cells. Notably, in addition to macrophages, we found that the majority of non-senescent \u03b2-gal-positive cells are rapidly dividing epithelial cells (Supplementary information, Fig. S10a, b). As a result, the potential types of proliferating cells with SSK1 sensitivity are greatly narrowed relative to gemcitabine. Even though small numbers of \u03b2-gal-positive epithelial cells are targeted by SSK1 treatment, these cells have robust self-renewal ability.61 Consistent with this self-renewal property, we found that epithelial tubular cells in the kidney with elevated \u03b2-gal activity had a high percentage of Ki67-positive cells (Supplementary information, Fig. S10c). Following SSK1 treatment, we observed only a few cells of this tubular cell population undergoing apoptosis (Supplementary information, Fig. S10d), and such low-level impairment could be easily repaired by the rapid self-renewal of tubular cells during SSK1 treatment. Moreover, the short duration of SSK1 treatment might avoid significant impairment in related tissues and further minimize its side effects. In summary, our study demonstrates the superiority and safety of this prodrug strategy by targeting \u03b2-gal to selectively remove senescent cells of multiple cell types. These findings open a new avenue for the treatment of age-associated diseases and provide a clinical opportunity for intervention into the aging process.",
