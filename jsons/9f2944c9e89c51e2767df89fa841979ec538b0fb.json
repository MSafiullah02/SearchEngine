Importantly, the emergence of rapid, user-friendly, multiplexed assays has great potential to facilitate earlier ASP intervention [3, 4] . However, the impact of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) on patient outcomes is clearer for some assays and specimen types than for others. Even less clear is how to optimize collaboration between laboratories and ASPs to maximize impact at the bedside. Here, we review published data related to clinical outcomes attributed to the use of current RDTs that detect pathogens in patients with bloodstream infections, respiratory infections, and neurological infections. In each case, we consider the following. Do we need molecular testing? Would rapid, on-demand testing be worthwhile to patients, or would batched testing suffice? And, finally, is there evidence supporting the use of the broad, syndromic, multiplexed tests, or do narrower monoplex or duplex assays suffice? the effectiveness of ASP interventions, including the implementation of an RDT. They can be categorized into two groups: process measures and outcome measures [5] . Process measures include the duration of antimicrobial therapy and time to antimicrobial optimization (e.g., through escalation, in which a narrow-spectrum antimicrobial regimen is broadened, or through de-escalation, which involves the reverse). Examples of outcome measures include length of stay (LOS); clinical cure (e.g., \"clearance\" of a bloodstream infection from blood cultures); and incidence of 30-day mortality, 30-day readmission, and adverse drug reactions. Hospital costs are also considered outcome measures. Both process measures and outcome measures can be meaningful when assessing the impact of an ASP intervention on patients and costs [6] .",

The wide spectrum of organisms to which BSIs are attributed, coupled with the urgency associated with BSI diagnosis, make rapid, highly sensitive, multiplexed assays attractive for this purpose. Not surprisingly, the impact of RDTs on patient care and outcomes has been most comprehensively studied in positive blood cultures. The goal of early provision of organism identification and antimicrobial susceptibility status is earlier optimization or discontinuation of antimicrobials. This, in turn, may translate into shorter LOS, reduced mortality, and decreased hospital costs. In addition, the FilmArray BCID has the ability to detect a limited group of antimicrobial resistance determinants, including mecA, vanA, and blaKPC.

In cases involving influenza A/B, RDTs may expedite treatment with antivirals (e.g., oseltamivir), potentially reducing the duration of the illness, although its impact on preventing clinical complications remains unclear [10] . Additionally, it is uncertain if detection of respiratory viruses other than influenza virus (e.g., parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, the coronaviruses, adenovirus, and rhinovirus) using molecular tests in panel-based assays (rapid or batched format) translates into benefits at the patient level. As antivirals are not routinely used to treat these viruses, to derive clinical benefit from rapid testing, clinical teams would need to feel a degree of reassurance from positive results to expedite discontinuation of antimicrobials and discharge from the hospital.

Pre-implementation, a variety of respiratory viral tests were offered, including rapid antigen testing, the Luminex xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel (Luminex, Austin, TX), DFA, and viral culture on nasopharyngeal swabs, and in some cases, bronchoalveolar lavage specimens. Following statistical adjustment for potential confounders, including age, immune status, asthma diagnosis, and admission to the intensive care unit, in the multivariate analysis, among patients diagnosed with influenza, LOS, duration of antimicrobial administration, and number of chest radiographs performed were reduced after implementation of FilmArray RP. The same phenomenon was not observed in patients in whom respiratory viruses other than influenza virus were detected [11] . The study ultimately suggested that while rapid diagnosis of influenza virus infection may have a positive impact on patient outcomes, rapid detection of other respiratory viruses may not lead to similar benefits and may call into question the need for panel testing of a broad range of respiratory pathogens.",

A CSF sample that rapidly tests positive for enterovirus in a patient with aseptic meningitis may be reassuring to a clinical team and lead to expedited discontinuation of antibiotics and acyclovir if the patient appears well. Similarly, HSV meningitis is common with primary genital HSV infection, and early detection could lead to the discontinuation of antibiotics but continuation of acyclovir. Conversely, in non-critical patients with meningitis, a negative result for HSV-1/HSV-2 may prompt discussion of discontinuing this nephrotoxic and neurotoxic antiviral. It is worth noting that in patients with encephalitis, the sensitivity of HSV PCR can vary, particularly early in the course of the illness [18] . In this context, clinicians may be reluctant to alter acyclovir therapy without repeatedly negative HSV-1/HSV-2 test results.",

However, data supporting the benefit of molecular RDTs in these cases are scarce. Using a retrospective quasi-experimental study design, Van and colleagues [20] recently described the effect of switching from the realStar alphaherpesvirus PCR kit, a multiplex PCR LDT that detects HSV-1, HSV-2, and varicella zoster virus, (alTona Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany) that was performed once per day, 6 days per week, to the Simplexa HSV 1 and 2 Direct assay, which was performed on demand, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. This study did not report any positive results, but among their 182 patients with suspected meningitis and/or encephalitis who were tested prior to rapid testing and 181 patients tested post-implementation, the study reported a decrease in the median duration of acyclovir therapy from 29.2 hours to 14.3 hours. The authors felt that, given evidence that renal toxicity and neurotoxicity typically occur within the first 48 hours of intravenous acyclovir administration, this reduction in acyclovir use associated with rapid HSV-1/HSV-2 testing had the potential to be clinically impactful [20] .",

The drivers of patient satisfaction are complex, but a variety of different measurement tools have attempted to incorporate the key elements. Data derived from the federally administered Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey have suggested that patient satisfaction with discharge planning may be associated with lower 30-day hospital readmission rates [30] . More timely and accurate determination of the agent responsible for an infectious condition has great potential to enhance a clinical team's ability to formulate an ideal discharge plan and counsel a patient about the clinical course after discharge. However, this, too, needs evaluation, and any positive impact of rapid testing would need to be weighed against the costs that might be incurred by the patient for the testing.",

Test turnaround time is typically 2 to 2.5 hours but may be shorter, with the PNA QuickFISH BC method (OpGen, Germantown, MD) having the shortest test time of 20 minutes. The FilmArray and Verigene assays detect Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. FilmArray also detects Candida species.",

The last has 7 viral targets (herpes simplex virus 1 [HSV-1], HSV-2, enterovirus, human parechovirus, varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, and human herpesvirus 6) and 6 bacterial targets (Escherichia coli K1, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus agalactiae); and also detects Cryptococcus neoformans/Cryptococcus gattii.",
