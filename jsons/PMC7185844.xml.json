To overcome this, live pathogens have been employed in commercial vaccines such as oral polio [12], [13], oral cholera [14], [15], [16], [17], oral rotavirus [18], [19], [20] and nasal influenza (FluMist\u2122 [21], [22], [23], NASOVAC\u2122 [24]), but these still retain some potential hazards for large-scale application. Hence, rational design of an appropriate adjuvant system with a potent capacity to stimulate immunity is essential [25]. Modern manufacturing technology is obliged to meet the following requirements: (1) stability of the antigen in an acidic, alkaline, or enzymatic environment [26], [27], [28]; (2) retention of the antigen despite constant clearance at mucosal sites [10], [29]; (3) potent induction of both systemic and mucosal immunity [30]; and (4) a balance between enhanced mucosal immunity and the possibility of immune tolerance when using high doses of antigen [10].",

Chitosan has been demonstrated to have distinct mucoadhesivity, which prolongs the antigen retention time at mucosal sites [5], as well as the ability to open the tight junctions between epithelial cells to intensify the transport of antigen to sites of immune induction and effector responses [6], [7], [34], [35]. Moreover, the versatility of chitosan enables a diversity of formulations for chitosan-based delivery systems, such as solutions, powders, micro/nanoparticles, hydrogels, and microneedle patches, to meet the various needs of novel vaccination methods [9], [10], [36], [37]. Recent research has proposed several promising chitosan-based formulations that are highly suitable as mucosal adjuvants with outstanding safety profiles. This article aims to provide an up-to-date review of pre-clinical and clinical applications for these novel adjuvant systems. Although chitosan has been investigated for many years as a basic material for mucosal adjuvants, it is not yet present in any marketed vaccine formulation. The main obstacles may be a lack of understanding of its metabolism and concerns regarding safety issues. Hence, a more comprehensive evaluation of its metabolism, safety profile, modes of action, and clinical applications is also presented in the following sections.",

A wide range of chitosan polymers is available with diverse molecular weights (MW), degrees of de-acetylation (DD), and modifications, all of which may impact on their solubility, biocompatibility, mucoadhesive behavior, and degradation, and thus influence their immunogenicity [38]. Scherlie\u00df et al. successfully showed that three commercialized chitosans with different MW and DD possessed varied levels of adjuvant activity, and the impurities (protein contaminants) in the chitosan were found to play only a minor role. They also pointed out that these diverse adjuvant effects cannot be attributed to a single factor but rather an interplay between molecular weight, degree of deacetylation, particle size, and solubility [39].",

The derivatization of chitosan not only enhances its water solubility, but also improves the cationic nature of the material, which enhances its interactions with antigens or cell membranes, boosting antigen adsorption/encapsulation and cellular internalization [44], as well as facilitating the residence time at mucosal sites [45]. Among the water-soluble chitosan derivatives, N-trimethyl chitosan (TMC) and N-(2-hydroxy) propyl-3-trimethyl ammonium chitosan chloride (HTCC) are the most commonly used mucosal adjuvants.

As a natural polysaccharide, chitosan is usually regarded as a non-toxic, biologically compatible polymer [50], [51]. In vitro studies have proven that chitosan can be degraded efficiently by lysozyme, resulting in approximately a 100% decrease in the weight of the chitosan hydrogel within 60 days [52]. Three enzymatically active forms of human chitinases have been identified in investigations of the degradation of chitosan and its derivatives [53], namely acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase), di-N-acetylchitobiase, and chitotriosidase, which have been found in the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and plasma, respectively [54], [55], [56], [57]. Recent research has revealed that the degradation kinetics depend strongly on both the molecular weight and the degree of deacetylation [39], [58]. Typically, a higher enzyme-reaction rate was found for the degradation of high-MW chitosan. Low-DD chitosan was degraded more rapidly, and the remaining 3 to 4 acetyl groups may serve as essential contacts in the active sites of chitosanases [57]. TMC was degraded by lysozyme at a similar rate to native chitosan, but the degradation rate was independent of pH [59].",

In addition, the optimal MW of chitosan for renal clearance was estimated to be 10 kDa.

In the case of chitosan-based mucosal adjuvants, understanding the distribution and degradation of chitosan is vitally important for dispelling safety concerns. Recently, Smith et al. pointed out that high-DD chitosan was degraded much more slowly under the local pH (5.5\u20136.5) of the nasal cavity and might guarantee that the administered chitosan would be cleared by mucociliary movement and swallowed into the alimentary tract, which might protect the body from severe adverse effects and toxicological responses [5].

In addition, different forms of chitosan have shown similar cytotoxic effects [66], [67]. A number of studies have shown the good tolerance and safety performance of chitosan administered via oral routes. In vivo, very few adverse effects have occurred in both mouse and rat models after oral intake of chitosan in doses of 1\u201315 g/kg/day for 3 months [68]. In addition, no relevant clinical signs were found in healthy human volunteers after taking oral doses of up to 6.75 g/day [69]. Moreover, people with shrimp allergies have shown no allergic reactions after oral administration of shellfish-derived glucosamine [70].",

Moreover, it is worth noticing that the physiochemical and biological properties of chitosan are also influenced by the original raw material, the manufacturing procedure, and even by the season and weather. Batch-to-batch consistency and stability of the raw material are other challenges when selecting chitosan-based adjuvants for clinical trials. The greatest difference between vaccine adjuvants and drug delivery systems is that vaccines are administered to healthy people, especially populations at high risk of contracting infectious diseases such as infants and the elderly, which means any side effects must be avoided [72]\n[73]. Nevertheless, the truth about adjuvants is that \u201cthe nearer they get to killing you, the more effective they are\u201d. There is an appropriate level of inflammatory response that is undesirable in a drug-delivery system but obligatory for immune stimulation. Future research must manage the balance between toxicity and adjuvanticity, in order to advance the clinical application of chitosan-based mucosal adjuvants.",

Recent evidence has showed that all three signals are key factors for T-lymphocyte activation [78]. Villiers et al. have demonstrated that chitosan induces the activation of DCs at the level of membrane-receptor recognition. Chitosan promoted the activation of DCs via a TLR4-dependent mechanism, with up-regulation of membrane proteins such as CD80 and CD86 [79]. However, it failed to elicit the robust cytokine production that activates T cells, which indicates that chitosan alone was unable to evoke a T-cell response. Nevertheless, when combined with antigen, chitosan and its derivatives stimulated the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, which profoundly up-regulate the expression of co-stimulator molecules, namely CD80, CD40, and CD86, as well as the secretion of the cytokines IL-6, IL-12, MIP-1, and TNF-\u03b1.

In the case of CSPs, tuning the cellular trafficking of antigen is triggered by the \u201clysosome escape\u201d pathway, which indicates that the internalized chitosan particles can disrupt the lysosome [99], [100] and escape into the cytoplasm through a \u201cproton sponge effect\u201d [101]. As shown in Fig. 1, the protonation of amino groups present on the chitosan chains leads to an extensive inflow of ions and water into the lysosome. When the \u201cproton sponge effect\u201d becomes strong enough, the entrapped components (CSP and antigen) are released by rupture of the lysosomes [102], [103]. The escaped exogenous antigen can be cross-presented through the MHC class I pathway, like endogenous antigens, to prime CD8+ T cells and evoke robust CTL responses [100], [104].",

When pathogens frequently breach the epithelial barrier, epithelial tissues are activated and serve as sensors for detecting danger signals through pattern-recognition receptors such as TLRs [105], [106]. They respond by releasing chemokines and cytokines to recruit MALT-resident immunocytes and trigger innate and adaptive immune responses [6]. Recently, chitosan-based adjuvant systems have been proven to have mucoadhesive qualities and the unique ability to open the tight junctions between epithelial cells at natural portals, which stimulates a robust mucosal immune response by facilitating the transport of antigens via an alternative yet effective route for antigen delivery [5], [30], [39], [74], [75].",

As shown in Fig. 2a, no fluorescent signal was detected in the PBS/H5N1 group 1 h post administration. However, strong fluorescence intensity could be observed in the HTCC/H5N1 group. More than 54% of the administered antigens persisted in the nasal cavity after 2 h (Fig. 2b), which shows the ability of chitosan to offer a sustained antigen-mucosal interaction without being cleared away [45].",

            "text": "The distinguishing trait of chitosan to mimic pathogen entry by opening tight junctions between epithelial cells has also been investigated in recent research [73], [110]. Artursson's group suggested that the ability to open junctions was due to the positively charged amino group on the C-2 position of chitosan, which could interact with the negatively charged mucosal surface [111]. In another study, they compared differences in the transport of [14C]-mannitol, among three chitosan-derivative solutions, including chitosan hydrochloride, chitosan glutamate, and TMC, all with a similar degree of de-acetylation. In the intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2, the transport of [14C]-mannitol was increased 34-fold by chitosan hydrochloride, 25-fold by chitosan glutamate, and 11-fold by TMC at 0.25% w/v concentrations in vitro, compared with the administration of mannitol alone [112]. By determining the change in transepithelial electrical resistance to indicate the tightness of the junctions and using confocal laser scanning microscopy in vitro, they further demonstrated the interactions between chitosan and zona occludens (ZO)-1 protein, which is regarded as the target of chitosan and its derivatives [113], [114], [115]. Hsu et al. elucidated the signaling mechanism underlying the opening of tight junctions by chitosan in Caco-2 cell monolayers. As shown in Fig. 3\n, the cascade of tight-junction opening is accompanied by the clustering of integrins (\u03b1v\u03b23) along the cell periphery, which led to the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK, also known as protein tyrosine kinase 2, PTK2) and Src (a family of non-specific tyrosine kinases). This also resulted in the regulation of tight-junction permeability via the redistribution of CLDN4 (a tight-junction protein) from the cell membrane to the cytosol and its eventual degradation in lysosomes [116], [117].",

In later research, van der Lubben et al. further showed that antigen was released from MPs after its uptake by M cells [138].

Compared to an uncoated Chi-OVA delivery system, significantly higher intestinal mucosal IgA and systemic IgG responses were detected after oral administration of coated Chi-OVA. [141]. In another study, Cho et al. presented a mucoadhesive and pH-sensitive thiolated Eudragit-coated chitosan microparticle, with an enhanced capacity for retaining the structural integrity of the encapsulated protein [142]. Recently, HBsAg-loaded chitosan microparticles were formulated. To overcome the limitations imposed by enzymatic degradation and permeation barriers, bacitracin was introduced as a protease inhibitor, which resulted in better protective levels of immunity after oral administration compared with aprotinin as a protease inhibitor. Moreover, the MPs remained stable at room temperature for up to four months [143].",

Vila et al. prepared tetanus toxoid-encapsulated chitosan nanoparticles as an intranasal antigen delivery system, which resulted in an increasing and long-lasting humoral immune response (IgG and IgA levels) [118]. The controlled release of antigen by chitosan particles is another important factor contributing to adjuvanticity. Mokarram et al. has demonstrated the effect of PEG (polyethylene glycol) modifications on the immune-stimulating performance of chitosan nanoparticles, using diphtheria toxoid-loaded chitosan nanoparticles with or without PEG modifications (CS-PEG and CS). In the study, CS-PEG and CS nanoparticles both elicited profoundly higher IgA and IgG levels compared with fluid antigen. In addition, the performance of CS-PEG as an adjuvant was significantly better, which may be due to the controlled releasing of antigen [119]. Scherlie\u00df et al. proposed a novel spray-dried and \u03b2-irradiated sterilized vaccine with outstanding stability for intranasal administration against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in non-human primates, and employed chitosan and a stabilizing and protecting solution (SPS). The chitosan in the formulation not only served as an inducer of immunity, but also stabilized the antigen, especially in combination with SPS. The seroconversion results revealed that the effectiveness of the pilot formulation was comparable to Pandemrix\u00ae. Moreover, the hemagglutination-inhibition titer of the group administered sterilized vaccine showed no difference from the group administered unsterilized vaccine [146].",

This hydrogel was designed to gelate in a short time at body temperature on the surface of the nasal mucosa, which significantly reduced mucociliary clearance and prolonged the antigen residence time in the nasal cavity. Using confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, we observed the stained nasal epithelia after intranasal administration of chitosan hydrogel, and have provided significant evidence for the disorganization of ZO-1 protein in nasal epithelial tissue. The thermo-sensitive hydrogel facilitated the transportation of antigen into the sub-mucosa via the paracellular pathway rather than the endocytosis pathway (Fig. 4\n). When employed in the intranasal delivery of H5N1 split antigen [45] and adenovirus antigen [136], the hydrogel system enhanced robust serum and mucosal antibody levels, the secretion of cytokines, and a potent response by antigen-specific memory CD8+ T cells.",

In Phase A of the study, three groups of subjects were administered intranasal diphtheria vaccine (50 \u03bcg of CRM197 with 9.5 mg of chitosan glutamate 213, and 2.5 mg of mannitol), antigen alone (on Day 0 and 28), or alum-adsorbed diphtheria toxoid vaccine via intramuscular injection (single administration on Day 0). Serum IgG and IgA from nasal wash were collected on Days 27 and 42. The results suggested that the chitosan intranasal formulation was well tolerated with only transient mild-to-moderate adverse effects (AEs), such as nasal discharge, blockage, and discomfort. There were no significant differences in the circulating antibody titers of the groups after first administration, but the antibody levels of the group receiving CRM197 and chitosan intranasally were boosted after a second vaccination [149].",

In study 1, 5 \u03bcg, 15 \u03bcg, and 50 \u03bcg dosages of Norwalk antigen and chitosan alone were evaluated. In study 2, four groups of healthy subjects were administered MPL/chitosan (50 or 100 \u03bcg VLP per dose, as a powder), chitosan only, or placebo (puff of air). The symptoms were recorded for 7 days after vaccination, and the safety evaluation was followed up for 180 days. Samples of serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were also collected. The results indicated that the most common symptoms were nasal stuffiness and discharge, and sneezing. No vaccine-related serious adverse effects (SAEs) were observed. The most significant immune response was found for the 100-\u03bcg dose, with IgG and IgA titers increased by 4.8 and 9.1-fold, respectively. All subjects who received the vaccine dose of 50 or 100 \u03bcg produced IgA antibody-secreting cells (ASCs), with surface molecules that are associated with homing to mucosal and peripheral lymphoid tissues (CD19+, CD27+, CD62L\u2212, integrin \u03b14/\u03b27+, CD19+, CD27+, CD62L+, and integrin \u03b14/\u03b27+).
