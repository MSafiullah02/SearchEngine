The novel avian influenza A (H7N9) virus has caused global concern as a potential pandemic threat. It seems that H7N9 avian influenza is the next chapter in a story that began with the SARS epidemic in China.",

It is estimated that China has a poultry population of 14 billion, 70% to 80% of which is reared in backyards.1 Densely populated southern China with backyard poultry farming practices has been a breeding ground for new influenza viruses.2 At typical wet markets in China, poultry confined in stacked metal cages could facilitate the transmission of avian influenza viruses. Furthermore, open-air butchering could expose the workers and consumers to avian influenza viruses more easily. However, China is immature in implementing animal disease detection and monitoring. Moreover, obstacles to the timely reporting of animal disease outbreaks still exist.2 It is true that individual farmers have few incentives to report sick or dead poultry. The fragmented nature of the agricultural sector makes regulation implementation difficult, as a number of food safety scandals have demonstrated in the last years.3\n",
