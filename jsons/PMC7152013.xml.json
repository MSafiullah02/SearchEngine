Tailoring this advice for an individual requires a thorough review of the travelers' itinerary and planned activities, consideration of the travelers' host characteristics, and a working knowledge of the epidemiology of relevant diseases. Travelers play an important role in the global epidemiology of infectious diseases; therefore ensuring that travelers are aware of specific preventive measures not only protects the health of the individual but has the potential to protect the health of their communities. In this chapter, pretravel considerations for major non\u2013vaccine-preventable infectious diseases are covered, including specific advice for dengue, chikungunya, Zika, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and avian influenza.",

With factors such as population growth, urbanization, globalization, travel, and climate change facilitating increased transmission, travel medicine practitioners in temperate countries are increasingly likely to see returned travelers with these infections. Furthermore, since the ranges of Aedes vectors extend into temperate areas, infected returned travelers can precipitate outbreaks of these viruses in nonendemic regions.",

Notably, the name chikungunya is derived from a Makonde word describing the bent posture that can be seen with severe arthralgia.16 The arthralgia/arthritis is usually symmetric and affects multiple joints, with fingers, wrists, ankles, elbows, toes, and knees the most often affected.14 Additional symptoms include headache, myalgia, conjunctivitis, and rash. The case fatality rate of chikungunya is <1%, but disease can be associated with significant acute and long-term morbidity secondary to debilitating polyarthralgia/arthritis.15 Although self-limiting in most individuals, some of those affected develop chronic joint pain that may last for months to years, with older people (>35\u201345 years) more predisposed.14, 18, 46 Unlike Dengue, in which nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are contraindicated, antiinflammatory drugs are indicated for symptomatic management of chikungunya infections.",
