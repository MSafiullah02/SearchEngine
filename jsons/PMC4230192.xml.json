In numerous applications (see e.g. [3-5]), a sequence family classified into subfamilies is given, with each subfamily being modeled separately by one pHMM (i.e. only the information comprehended in the respective subfamily is used). If enough information is available about each subfamily (i.e. it consists of a sufficient number of sequences) this approach is feasible. Otherwise, the model is unable to detect sequences stemming from subfamilies composed of too few sequences [4].",

Although they are usually named differently, information sharing protocols are a widely used concept in bioinformatics and other fields. For example, deducing pseudocounts [6] or Dirichlet mixtures [7] from a complete multiple sequence alignment to model a prior distribution for position-wise nucleotide or protein emission probabilities, constitutes a protocol for sharing information between different columns of the multiple sequence alignment (MSA). In speech recognition, using the same parameters for different HMMs within complex systems of HMMs in order to reduce the complexity of the system is called parameter tying [8]. In fact, if a prior distribution in a Bayesian framework [9] is deduced from a superordinate entity, one can regard the estimation of probabilities characterizing a subordinate part of this entity by application of the estimated prior distribution as an information sharing protocol.",

Moreover, 11 full-length and about 1000 partial sequences have been labeled as \u201cunknown\u201d. That is, these sequences do not form an independent subtype or CRF. One can expect that by further sampling activities new small-size subtypes will be found, by finding sequences which are closely related to sequences of an unknown subtype already known, as well as by discovering sets of epidemiological independent sequences which are unrelated to the sequences now available [11].",

Examples are Bootscanning [15], Simplot [16], Recco [17], the REGA HIV-1 Subtyping Tool [18], and MaxChi2 [19]. In 2006, Schultz et al. developed the jumping profile Hidden Markov Model (jpHMM), an algorithm for subtyping, recombination analysis, and breakpoint detection, which we applied to HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus sequences [4]. The jpHMM is composed of one pHMM for each viral subtype. In addition to the usual transitions within these pHMMs, it allows for so-called jumps between different pHMMs at nearby positions. Thus, it is possible to jump between states associated with different subtypes, depending on the local similarity of the query sequence to the subtypes. Although performing well for most input sequences, it did not correctly predict the HIV-1 subtypes of smaller size H, J, and K. Further analysis revealed that this deficit was due to the lack of an appropriate inter-subtype information sharing protocol, i.e., no information from the large-size subtypes was used to model the small-size subtypes.",

In fact, for the majority of sites, it would be most plausible to assign equal emission probabilities to all subtypes. Neglecting the trivial case of all subtypes having the same emission probability assigned to them, the phenomenon that some but not all of the subtypes exhibit equal emission probabilities could be explained biologically as follows: Assume a site allows for more than one nucleotide to be present (i.e. at least two alleles are observed). Then, there are only very few characteristics of the virus which determine which degree of fitness the virus has for the different nucleotides possible at the respective site. Moreover, these characteristics take only very few values. As the characteristics and their values at a particular site are small in number, the number of different nucleotide distributions observed at the respective site is also small.",

For Subtypes H and K, recombinants built from Subtypes C and F, respectively, do not yield a notably low performance. Since Subtypes K and F are phylogenetically closer than H and C (J and A, respectively), we can conclude that the low performance for recombinants built from Subtype J and A is probably simply coincidental and that the influence of the phylogenetic distance is at most weak for recombinants between HIV-1 Group M subtypes.",

Beyond that, it is even discussed whether the entire classification system exhibits flaws: For example, it has been debated whether Subtype G is in fact a recombinant and CRF02 a pure subtype [45-48]. Moreover, the total number of CRFs is still quite small and a large fraction of them possesses only a few breakpoints, i.e., the number of potential test sequences is limited. Furthermore, it is a widespread approach to evaluate the performance of recombination detection tools using (semi-)artificial recombinants [21,46,49,50].

In between, for each source combination, the probability of the respective source combination given the nucleotide frequencies is shown on the left side, whereas the emission probabilities of each subtype for the particular source combination is given on the right side. The coloring indicates to which source each subtype belongs for the respective source combination. For example, the third column in the middle block represents the source combination, for which Subtype A and C belong to one source (green) and Subtype B to another (red), yielding emission probabilities of 0.844 and 0.156, respectively, for the green source and of 0.082 and 0.918, respectively, for the red one (we elaborate on some details in this table in the supplements). The simplification made consists of the restriction to 3 subtypes and 2 nucleotides.",
