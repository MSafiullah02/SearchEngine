            "text": "Acute lung injury (ALI), and its more severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), are important causes of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients [1]. One of the hallmarks of ALI/ARDS is the accumulation of protein-rich edema fluid in the alveolar compartment of the lung [1], caused by increased fluid influx into the airspaces, and decreased fluid transport out of these airspaces. In the case of the latter, impaired alveolar fluid clearance (AFC) is a key underlying cause of alveolar edema persistence [2, 3], and the ability of ALI/ARDS patients to clear edema fluid is correlated with a shorter stay in the intensive care unit, and reduced mortality [4]. Much effort has therefore been focused on identifying pathogenic mechanisms underlying perturbed AFC in ALI/ARDS patients, and how we can potentiate AFC, which may form the basis of novel or improved therapeutic strategies. The accompanying review by Vad\u00e1sz et al. (http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00134-007-0661-8) details our current understanding of the signaling mechanisms that facilitate AFC. To complement that report this review focuses on how intact organ and animal models and clinical studies have facilitated our understanding of AFC in ALI/ARDS. We also discuss how some of these studies have led to novel therapeutic approaches.",

            "text": "Edema fluid is transported out of the alveolar airspaces into the interstitium, where it is cleared by the lymphatic drainage. Alternatively, fluid can also be transported into the vasculature, where it is cleared by the circulation. Maintenance of an optimum alveolar fluid volume results from a finely balanced influx of fluid into the lung, and fluid clearance out of the lung; therefore, endothelial and epithelial barrier integrity is essential for optimal fluid balance [3]. In patients with ALI/ARDS, the integrity of both the endothelial and epithelial barriers may be compromised, leading to accelerated fluid influx into the alveolar compartment and impaired AFC [3]. In healthy lungs the alveolar epithelium is considerably less permeable than the endothelium [5]. Approximately 90% of the alveolar epithelium surface area is composed of flat alveolar type I cells, with the remaining 10% accounted for by cuboidal type II cells which produce surfactant and are progenitor cells that regenerate the epithelium after injury. Historically, type II cells are accredited with a key role in AFC. It is widely accepted that AFC is driven by sodium transport across the airway epithelium, which is affected by the concerted action of two sodium transport systems: the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) [6] and the Na+, K+ transporting adenosine-5\u2032-triphosphatase (Na,K-ATPase) [7] as well as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR; a chloride channel) [8] and other, as yet uncharacterized channels [9]. Impaired function of any one of these ion transport systems can perturb AFC. Diffuse alveolar damage, including severe alveolar epithelial damage, is one of the hallmarks of ALI/ARDS [1, 10], where extensive type I cell necrosis occurs, leaving an intact but denuded basement membrane which is repopulated by hyperplastic type II cells that regenerate the alveolar epithelium [11]. Given the established importance of the type II cell in AFC [6] and the emerging importance of the type I cell in AFC with the recent discovery that type I cells also contain functional sodium and chloride channels [12], this epithelial damage is likely to massively impact AFC in ALI/ARDS patients. This idea is strengthened by the observation that in patients with hydrostatic pulmonary edema, which may result from congestive heart failure or acute myocardial infarction, both the alveolar epithelial barrier and AFC remain intact [13].",

O'Brodovich and colleagues [22] have further demonstrated that application of amiloride to newborn guinea pig lungs caused respiratory distress, hypoxemia and elevated extravascular lung water, implicating active sodium transport in AFC in neonates. Consistent with this idea, targeted deletion of both ENaC\u03b1 alleles in mice caused death within 40 h of birth as a consequence of impaired AFC [23]. Transgenic overexpression of the ENaC\u03b1 gene in an ENaC\u03b1\u2013/\u2013 null mouse background rescued this pulmonary phenotype [24]. Conversely, overexpression of ENaC in the mouse lower airways accelerated sodium absorption, and depleted the volume of fluid coating the airway epithelium [25]. Together, these data implicate both active transepithelial sodium transport and ENaC itself in AFC. Using small interfering RNA directed against ENaC\u03b1 applied to the airways of live rats, other non-ENaC type ion channels are also likely to play an important role in transepithelial sodium transport and fluid reabsorption, particularly baseline fluid reabsorption [9].",

Using glibenclamide, an inhibitor of potassium and CFTR channels, fluid clearance from in situ perused and unperfused mouse lungs and ex vivo human lungs was impaired [8]. These data were supported using a cystic fibrosis (\u0394F508) mouse in a model of acute hydrostatic edema, where chloride transport by the CFTR channel was demonstrated to play a major role in AFC [8]. Further supporting this idea, adenoviral-mediated transfer of the CFTR gene into the lungs of live rats and mice significantly increased AFC, an effect that was blocked in the presence the chloride channel blockers 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid, bumetanide, and glibenclamide [30]. Animal and organ models have thus confirmed invaluable in the identification of transepithelial active sodium transport as the basis of AFC, and in the validation of ENaC and other channels and the Na,K-ATPase, as key components that drive this process.",

            "text": "Hypoxia is a feature of both ARDS and high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). In isolated, ventilated rat lungs perfused at constant pressure (therefore independent of pressure changes caused by adaptation to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction), exposure to hypoxia (1.5\u201314% O2, for 2 h) increased the permeability of the alveolo-capillary barrier, causing alveolar flooding that was exacerbated by a hypoxia-mediated block of AFC [31]. Alveolar fluid clearance in live rats was decreased by 36% after 48 h of exposure to 10% O2 [32] while transepithelial sodium transport assessed by NPD was decreased by 24% in live rats exposed to 10% O2 for 24 h [33]. Both observations were attributed to reduced Na,K-ATPase activity. It remains unclear whether hypoxia influenced expression of sodium transporter genes, since different groups have reported downregulation [34], unchanged expression [33], and upregulation [35] of sodium transport machinery in response to hypoxia; however, all groups reported impaired AFC in response to hypoxia. The rapid reversibility of impaired AFC by \u03b22-agonists suggested that hypoxia alters intracellular trafficking of sodium transport machinery [35]. This idea is supported by the observed hypoxia-induced endocytosis of Na,K-ATPase from the basolateral membrane of alveolar epithelial cells [36], which slows down transepithelial sodium transport, and hence, AFC [37]. Irrespective of the mechanism at play, the ability of hypoxia to block AFC is now regarded as a key mechanism of barrier dysfunction and edema persistence in HAPE [38] and in ALI/ARDS [39].",

Similar trends were observed in an acid aspiration-induced model of ALI in rats, where a progressive reduction in VT from 12 to 6 to 3 ml/kg, keeping PEEP fixed at 10 to 12 cm H2O, was accompanied by a progressive decrease in EVLW accumulation [48].

This block was reversible upon restoration of normal CO2 levels and was not induced by metabolic alkalosis. The AFC block was attributed to impaired sodium transport resulting from decreased membrane abundance of the Na,K-ATPase in rat lungs [51].

Coagulation proteases such as thrombin have well documented roles in the development of ALI/ARDS where thrombin can directly increase vascular permeability and promote alveolar flooding [1]. Recent work by Vad\u00e1sz et al. [52] demonstrated that thrombin applied to the vascular compartment of isolated, ventilated and perfused rabbit lungs also impaired AFC. This was attributed to a block in transepithelial sodium and hence fluid transport across the alveolocapillary barrier. It was subsequently demonstrated that thrombin promoted the endocytosis of the Na,K-ATPase, thereby reducing Na,K-ATPase activity (see the accompanying review by Vad\u00e1sz et al. (http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00134-007-0661-8). Thus coagulation proteases play a dual role in impaired AFC. In addition to causing a permeability edema, thrombin, by virtue of its signaling properties, directly blocks fluid reabsorption. In contrast to the thrombin-signaling effects on Na,K-ATPase trafficking, serine proteases can directly enhance \u03b2-adrenergic-stimulated ENaC activity in alveolar epithelial cells and enhance \u03b2-adrenergic-stimulated AFC in live mice [53]. Thus serine proteases appear to have opposing effects on different components of the sodium transport machinery.",

Interestingly, AFC was upregulated after intratracheal administration of endotoxin to live rats and in a rat model of septic shock [54], possibly as a protective mechanism induced during septic shock to overcome alveolar flooding. However, both cell-surface ENaC expression and AFC were downregulated in an experimental Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in live mice, an effect mediated by reactive oxygen-nitrogen intermediates [55]. This phenomenon is not limited to bacterial pathogens, since in live rats, the influenza virus can directly impair ENaC activity by reducing the open probability (P\no) of the channel, and thus downregulate AFC, independently of viral entry into the epithelium [56]. Thus it appears that lung infections can impair AFC, although there appear to be multiple underlying causes.",

In contrast, atrial natriuretic factor applied to the vasculature of isolated, perfused lungs [60], and TGF-\u03b2 applied intratracheally to live rats [61] impaired transepithelial sodium transport and blocked AFC.

Several small phase III clinical trials addressing the potential benefit of low VT (which is lung protective) vs. traditional higher VT (providing better oxygenation) yielded conflicting results (reviewed in [62]). A subsequent multicenter, randomized, controlled trial of 861 patients conducted under the auspices of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute ARDS Network demonstrated that a 6 ml/kg VT ventilation strategy yielded a significant reduction in mortality compared with a 12 ml/kg VT ventilation strategy (with a plateau pressure of < 30 cmH2O) [63]. While EVLW was not assessed in this trial, the 6 ml/kg VT ventilation strategy also increased the number of ventilator-free days, indicative of improved lung function. To date this remains the only intervention with a confirmed benefit on clinical outcome, and clearly demonstrates how studies on ALI/ARDS in animal and organ models have translated into a successful therapeutic strategy.",

            "text": "Catecholamine-stimulated transepithelial sodium transport is the most intensely explored possibility of manipulating AFC in a therapeutic context. It was demonstrated in 1978 that epinephrine stimulated AFC from the airspaces of newborn mammals [64], implicating \u03b2-adrenergic receptors in AFC. Both epinephrine and terbutaline stimulated AFC in anesthetized sheep [65], and terbutaline stimulated transepithelial sodium transport in an isolated, buffer-perfused rat lung [66] and dramatically enhanced alveolar fluid clearance in a resected human lung [67]. \u03b2-Adrenergic agonists also reduce high vascular pressure-induced vascular permeability in isolated rat lungs [68], indicating that \u03b2-adrenergic agonsist may influence both reduce barrier permeability and potentiate AFC. The ability of \u03b2-adrenergic agonists to stimulate AFC is attributed in part to recruitment from intracellular pools (a) of Na,K-ATPase to the basolateral membrane [69] and (b) of ENaC to the apical membrane [70] of alveolar epithelial cells (reviewed in [71]). Furthermore, \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation can clear edema in hypoxia-induced ALI [35] and ventilator-associated lung injury [72] in animals, suggesting a potentially exciting therapeutic potential for \u03b2-adrenergic agonists in the treatment of ALI/ARDS. This idea was further supported by the observations that adenovirus-mediated transfer of \u03b2-adrenergic receptor genes to live rats improved AFC due to increased sensitivity to endogenous catecholamines and consequent upregulation of Na,K-ATPase activity and ENaC protein expression the lung [73]. More recently a role for the CFTR channel in cAMP-stimulated AFC has been proposed since AFC in cystic fibrosis (\u0394F508) mice, which lack CFTR activity was not stimulated with \u03b2-adrenergic agonists [8]. Furthermore, administration of a CFTR inhibitor to live mice blocked cAMP-stimulated AFC [14]. These studies provide strong evidence of an important role for the CFTR channel, along with the transepithelial sodium transport system, in \u03b2-adrenergic-stimulated AFC.",

The BALTI trial demonstrated that sustained treatment with intravenous \u03b2-agonists was generally well tolerated, although patients receiving salbutamol exhibited a trend towards higher heart rates, and patients in the salbutamol group exhibited higher incidence (26% vs. 10% in the placebo group) of supraventricular arrhythmias. Patients receiving salbutamol demonstrated a significant reduction in EVLW in comparison to placebo-treated patients. The trial was not, however, powered to detect a mortality benefit.

The potential beneficial effects of glucocorticoid use are attributed in part to the ability of glucocorticoids to influence AFC, by upregulating protein expression of the sodium transporting machinery. Preterm infants with respiratory distress exhibit reduced expression of ENaC relative to healthy, full-term infants [80]. Administration of dexamethasone to these infants upregulated ENaC expression, restoring ENaC expression to levels observed in healthy infants [80]. Working in adult rats, Noda et al. [81] demonstrated that a single intraperitoneal injection of dexamethasone dramatically increased AFC and reversed hypoxemia induced by an intratracheal fluid challenge, 48\u201372 h after dexamethasone administration. This was attributed to an increase in ENaC mRNA levels. While Na,K-ATPase mRNA levels were not altered, Na,K-ATPase activity was increased. These data suggest that glucocorticoids may be of use in the treatment of ARDS by potentiating AFC.",

This protective effect has been attributed to the ability of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) to upregulate expression of components of the sodium transporting machinery, primarily the Na,K-ATPase, as well as its mitogenic properties on alveolar type II cells, since the alveolar epithelium is may be denuded in ALI/ARDS. An upregulation of AFC attributable to elevated Na,K-ATPase levels has also been reported for epidermal growth factor (EGF) instilled into lungs of live rats, where EGF was proposed to upregulate expression levels of Na,K-ATPase [87]. Other nonpeptide hormones can also influence AFC. For example, 3,3\u2032,5-triiodo-L-thyronine upregulated AFC in live adult rats, apparently by upregulation of transepithelial sodium transport [88].",

Oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide suppress glucocorticoid-induced ENaC gene transcription, an effect reversed by reactive oxygen scavengers, including thioredoxin. In a rat model of hemorrhagic shock Modelska et al. [93] demonstrated that catecholamines were ineffective at upregulating AFC. However, after either intravenous administration of NAC, intratracheal administration of reduced glutathione or neutrophil depletion with vinblastine, the effect of catecholamines was restored. These data provided in vivo evidence that neutrophil-mediated oxidative injury impaired AFC in ALI. Building on this study, Lee et al. [94] demonstrated that the induction of hemoxygenase I (HO-1), a potent antioxidant, restores normal AFC after hemorrhagic shock by blocking iNOS-mediated NO release. Therefore with regard to edema resolution antioxidant therapy would most likely augment glucocorticoid or catecholamine-based efforts to upregulate AFC.",

Furthermore, transfer of \u03b22-adrenergic receptor genes to the lungs of adult rats increased their sensitivity to exogenous catecholamines, and upregulated AFC due to increased delivery of both ENaC and Na,K-ATPase to epithelial cell membranes [73]. Transfer of the CTFR gene to mouse and rat lungs also augmented AFC and appeared to affect the expression and function of components of the sodium transport machinery [30]. These data together suggest that the sodium transporting and \u03b2-adrenergic signaling systems in the lung are candidate targets for intervention by gene therapy in ALI/ARDS. Clearly, enough epithelial cells would have to be present in the damaged epithelium for gene therapy to be effective, therefore, regeneration of the damaged epithelium with growth factors such as KGF has also been addressed by gene therapy. Liposome-mediated KGF gene delivery into mouse lungs afforded protection in an oleic-acid induced lung injury model [89]. Similarly, in the case of antioxidants adenovirus-mediated gene delivery of HO-1 into the lungs of live mice afforded significant protection against influenza virus- and lipopolysaccharide-induced ALI [99]. While AFC was not specifically addressed in the KGF or HO-1 studies, the documented role of KGF and HO-1 in augmenting AFC suggests that this phenomenon contributed to the beneficial effect observed.",

Perturbations to the alveolo-capillary barrier can both promote the formation and prevent the resolution of alveolar edema associated with ALI/ARDS. Indeed, edema resolution is critical for the ALI/ARDS patient to survive. Animal and organ models of edema resolution and ALI have proved irreplaceable in the development of novel therapeutic strategies that augment AFC, the most obvious case being the low tidal volume ventilation strategy for the management of ARDS, a strategy that has now been validated in a large multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial. Due to our focus on AFC several other important ALI/ARDS candidate therapies currently under evaluation have been omitted from this review, including other ventilation strategies, surfactant replacement, fluid management, inhaled vasodilators, and nonglucocorticoid anti-inflammatory agents. The reader is referred to other excellent reviews on these topics [62, 100]. Animal and organ models and clinical studies will no doubt continue to prove instrumental in the further development of several new and emerging ideas designed to augment AFC in ALI, notable among these are anticoagulation, stimulation of the \u03b2-adrenergic system, and local gene delivery to the alveolar epithelium.\n\n",
