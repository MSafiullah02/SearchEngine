Two mechanisms of virus injury are hypothesized: (1) direct-virus injury and (2) cytokine storm. Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a human cell receptor with a strong binding affinity to the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 is highly expressed in type II alveolar cells, intestinal epithelia, vascular endothelium, and cardiac muscle. ACE2 is also identified in the nervous system leading to direct-virus injury 1 . A subgroup of patients might have severe cytokine storm consistent with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis causing a fatal hypercytokinemia with multiorgan failure. Indirect mechanism of neurological injury mainly relates to increased coagulation activity, markedly increased D-dimer concentrations in these patients 5, 6 leading to increased risk of thromboembolic stroke 7 as well as compromised cardiac status due to associated cardiac injury 8 . We describe use of neuroimaging, incidence and spectrum of acute neuroimaging findings and their prognostic role in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in New York City. 38 patients had acute neuroimaging findings (8.4% of those who underwent neuroimaging and 1.2% of the total hospital admitted COVID-19 patients); and 35 patients had stroke (7.7% of those who had neuroimaging and 1.1% of COVID-19 inpatients) ( Table 1) .",

It is no surprise that emerging evidence shows that COVID-19 may also predispose patients to both venous and arterial thromboembolism due to diffuse intravascular coagulation, hypoxia, cytokine storm and immobilization 6 . High D-dimer levels, a marker of inflammation, are known to be associated with poor outcome in COVID-19 8 . Acute strokes seen in the current study are also likely related to thromboembolic disease and majority were present at the initial admission. Most importantly, our data demonstrates for the first time, that when a neuroimaging shows acute large ischemic stroke or hemorrhagic stroke in admitted COVID-19 patients, it is one of the strongest prognostic markers of poor outcome, even more than age and other previously reported comorbidities such as hypertension and obesity 8 . COVID-19 patients who have a large ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke on imaging have a 50% mortality in the current study.",

A confirmed case of Covid-19 was defined as a positive result on real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab specimens 9 . Initial tests were conducted by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene; as of March 16, tests were conducted in our clinical laboratory using the Roche SARS-CoV2 assay in the Cobas 6800 instruments through emergency use authorization (EUA) granted by the FDA. On March 31 we added testing using the SARS-CoV2 Xpert Xpress assay in the Cepheid GeneXpert instruments also under EUA by FDA. The targets amplified by these assays are the ORF1/a and E in the Roche Cobas assay and N2 and E genes in the Cepheid XpertXpress. Since March 16, only pharyngeal samples were collected and tested. Each neuroimaging study was evaluated for acute neuroimaging findings related to COVID-19 and all disagreements were resolved with consensus by the four fellowship-trained neuroradiologists. Descriptive statistics were utilized to characterize the cohort and Student's t-test to compare mean ages. To assess the risk of mortality conferred by positive neuroimaging findings, a multivariable logistic regression (LR) model was adjusted for age, body mass index and hypertension in a sub-group of 2894 patients. These covariates were selected a priori based on known risks for neurologic and COVID-19 complications, while limiting covariates to avoid overfitting the model. As a secondary analysis, to account for right censoring from hospitalizations still in progress, we constructed a competing risk regression survival analysis (CRR) with the competing risk being hospital discharge. age 64 years, range 2 weeks-105 years, 60.7% males) were done. Neuroimaging examinations constituted only 5.4% of the 13,314 imaging examinations performed in these patients during the study period. Chest imaging examinations were the most common (10,182, 76.5%, 9859 Chest X-rays, 323 CT studies). The most common neuroimaging study performed was CT of the head (586, 81.8%). 323 patients (71.1%) had one examination, 131 patients (28.9%) had more than one imaging examination (2-14 imaging examinations). Other neuroimaging studies performed included CT angiography of the head and neck (34, 4.7%), CT perfusion (14, 2%), MRI brain (48, 6.7%), MRA/MRV (17, 2.4%), and MRI spine (12, 1.7%). Five catheter angiography studies were performed for endovascular treatment of stroke. Common clinical indications for neuroimaging studies performed on COVID-19 patients included altered mental status or delirium (37.6%), stroke (17.3%), and mechanical fall or trauma (25.5%). Less common indications included syncope (4%), headache (3.8%), dizziness (2.8%), seizure (2.1%) and ataxia (1.4%).",
