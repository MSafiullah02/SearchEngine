            "text": "Autoimmune diseases tend to cluster not only in families but also in the same individual. Graves disease is an example of an autoimmune disease in which autoantibodies bind with hormone receptors of the thyroid gland, causing the thyroid to overproduce thyroid hormone [1]. It is characterized clinically by diffuse goiter, ophthalmopathy, hyperthermia, agitation, weight loss, palpitations, and even heart failure [1]. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is an autoimmune disease caused by a deficiency of ADAMTS13, a von Willebrand Factor (vWF)-cleaving metalloprotease [2]. This leads to the buildup of vWF multimers, activating a cascade in the bloodstream leading to destruction of platelets by the large multimers. TTP is characterized by thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and evidence of end-organ damage. The treatment primarily is plasmapheresis to remove the autoantibodies from the bloodstream [2]. TTP carries a high mortality. Graves disease has been associated with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), but only a few case reports have described a possible association of Graves disease with TTP. We present a case in which a patient with Graves disease was found to be biochemically and clinically hyperthyroid with concurrent TTP.",

Unfortunately, these were drawn following several sessions of plasmapheresis; therefore, the absence or presence of thyroid autoimmune antibodies was not thought to be reliable for diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid disease. The patient\u2019s Graves disease diagnosis was based on thyromegaly, glandular hypervascularity, and lack of biochemical improvement despite over 4 months of thionamide therapy. In preparation for thyroidectomy, she was treated with propylthiouracil, potassium iodide oral solution, cholestyramine, prednisone, and propranolol.

All these complications led to a subsequent decline in her platelet count. A new medication recently approved for acquired TTP called caplacizumab, a monoclonal antibody to vWF, was considered in her management. Her platelets stabilized at approximately 50,000/\u03bcl (140,000\u2013450,000/\u03bcl), and her ADAMTS13 activity normalized, so the caplacizumab was not administered.

TTP usually involves microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal injury [3].

It is associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as ITP, Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, and systemic sclerosis; however, it is not commonly associated with Graves disease. It has inherited and acquired forms [4]. The mortality associated with TTP can be as high as 90%, and clinical diagnosis is the key to rapid management [4].",

Several therapies are available, including plasma exchange (PEX), high-dose steroids, rituximab, and caplacizumab. Daily PEX is the mainstay of treatment. It allows removal of autoantibodies and repletes ADAMTS13. If there is any delay in PEX, then fresh frozen plasma transfusion should be considered. Platelet transfusion is contraindicated unless bleeding is life-threatening [5]. Caplacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody fragment that binds to vWF and blocks vWF interaction with platelet glycoprotein lb-IX-V. As indicated by faster platelet count normalization, it prevents further consumption of platelets into microthrombi and the consequent progression of tissue ischemia [6].",

Graves disease patients receiving thionamide therapy should be monitored for agranulocytosis by checking the complete blood count. If there are any abnormalities in the cell count, especially thrombocytopenia, clinicians should consider the possibility of another autoimmune process, such as TTP, in the appropriate clinical context. Emphasis should be placed on controlling hyperthyroidism and avoiding lapses in medical therapy to prevent complications, as in our patient\u2019s case.",
