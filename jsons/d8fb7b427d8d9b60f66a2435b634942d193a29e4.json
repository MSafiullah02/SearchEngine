All COVID-19 burns were managed at Full COVID-19 or Hybrid COVID-19 hospitals. Non-burn COVID-19 patients were managed in Non-COVID-19 and Hybrid COVID-19 hospitals. (Figure 1) During this unprecedented crisis, we implemented certain changes in the management of burns in Malaysia to ensure the health system would be able to handle the anticipated surge in demand for hospital beds and acute care facilities with the progress of the pandemic. All new burn patients presented to the hospital underwent mandatory screening using a standardized questionnaire. (Table 1) If any of these questions were positive, the patients were referred to the Infectious Disease team for the COVID-19 risk assessment. Indications for the COVID-19 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test are as follows but not limited to, the following. 1. All burns patients requiring surgery. 2. All burns patients with an identified risk for COVID-19 from the questionnaire 3. All burns patients presenting with respiratory symptoms Management of burn patients were divided into three categories; 1. Emergency, 2. Semiemergency, and 3. Elective. All elective procedures were rescheduled until the current situation improves. Emergency cases such as burns with compartment syndrome were J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f performed in the COVID-19 prepared operating theatre with personal protective equipment (PPE) and enhanced airborne precaution. This group of patients was managed as COVID-19 positive until test results became available. Patients for semi-emergency surgery were subjected to COVID-19 rRT-PCR testing. Patients with positive results were transferred to a COVID-19 designated hospital (hybrid or full COVID hospital) with negative pressure transport and standard precautions. Patients with negative results were managed in the general operation theatre. Minor burns and uncomplicated wounds in stable patients were managed as an outpatient. Wherever possible, wound management in patients with minor burns was decentralized to the nearest primary health care facility to minimize exposure risk for both patients and health care workers. The usage of telemedicine for referrals and consultation was emphasized during this pandemic period. Consultations were conveyed immediately with accuracy from a primary or secondary health care facility to a covering Burn Unit. Patients received professional diagnosis and treatment without delay.",
