However, research has indicated that adolescents tend to have low adherence to health advice and often engage in risky behaviors that may put them at risk for life-endangering conditions or make them vulnerable to illnesses later in life [6], [7], [8]. There is an increasing belief that adolescents should be targeted for health promotion activities [9], [10].",

            "text": "Various psychosocial models have been used to understand factors relating to adolescents\u2019 practice of health behaviors to facilitate the design and planning of health promotion strategies. Models that include perceived threat as a core component are most useful in understanding the practice of a variety of adolescent preventive health behaviors [11]. Among these models, the present study focuses on the Health Belief Model (HBM). According to the HBM [12], perceived threat refers to beliefs about the seriousness of a particular disease and one\u2019s susceptibility to this disease. The basic HBM also has three other core components, namely perceived benefits, perceived barriers, and cues to action. Perceived benefits refer to the degree to which an individual perceives particular health behaviors as beneficial or effective, whereas perceived barriers are perceived costs of undertaking specific health behaviors. Cues to action are prompts that remind or facilitate an individual to practice certain health behaviors. Two other components, knowledge and self-efficacy, have been added in the more recent modification of the HBM [13], [14], [15]. Self-efficacy refers to beliefs in an individual\u2019s own ability to perform the desired health behaviors.",

Similarly, the HBM is also useful in understanding Chinese adolescent health behaviors such as influenza vaccination [19] and HIV preventive behaviors [20]. Across these studies, perceived threat is consistently found to be the most powerful correlate of various health behaviors. The significance of other components varies with different target health behaviors and samples. Furthermore, the HBM is found to be more predictive of volitional health behaviors that are novel and new to the behavioral repertoire of an individual than habitual health behaviors that are usually well established and over-learned [21], [22], [23].",

Their perceived threat of SARS may have been increased by daily reports of SARS infection figures [4], different media programs on SARS, documentation about patients infected with or having died of SARS, and class suspension during the outbreak of SARS [24]. They may also perceive preventive health behaviors against SARS as having more benefits than costs, as local health authorities often emphasize their effectiveness and ease to perform [25]. There are abundant environmental cues to remind adolescents to adhere to health advice, and these include posters and notices about SARS preventive behaviors in noticeable areas in schools/public areas as well as disinfection stations with free alcohol towels and liquid soap in major shopping malls. Furthermore, updated information about SARS and effective ways to perform relevant preventive health behaviors are also disseminated through the media, seminars, and public education activities.",

At the time of this study, SARS was spreading quickly in the local community with 20 to 30 new infections daily. Causative agents, transmission route, diagnostic tests, and specific treatments of the disease were still not yet fully known. Local health authorities had since implemented enhanced infection-control procedures in all hospitals, cohorting of SARS patients, suspension of classes for schools and universities, and ordering of infected individuals and their close contacts to quarantine themselves at home for at least 10 days. In the community, health advice was disseminated and vigorous community-wide public education and prevention programs in relationship to SARS were also launched.",

Telephone numbers were randomly selected from the local residential telephone directory for 2002, which covered all listed telephone numbers in all regions of Hong Kong. The last two digits of telephone numbers were deleted and replaced by two random numbers generated by the computer to capture unlisted telephone numbers. When telephones were busy or there was no answer, three follow-up calls on different dates and times were attempted before substituting a new telephone number. Individuals who first answered the phone, who were aged 11 years or above, and who were of Chinese ethnicity were invited to a 20-minute telephone interview on their demographic data, responses to local SARS outbreak, and practice of various SARS preventive health behaviors. The decision was made a priori to recruit until 1500 interviews were completed. Out of 2370 valid household contacts, 795 households refused to participate in the study, 38 were incomplete interviews with more than half of the required information missing, and successful telephone interviews were conducted with 1537 households. The success rate, calculated as percentages of completes to complete plus refusals/incompletes, was 64.4%. The sampling error was 3.1 percentage points. Among 1537 successful telephone interviews in the larger study, 15% (n = 230) of the respondents were aged 11 to 18 years. The proportion of adolescents to adults in the larger study was comparable to 13.2% in the general population as reported in the 2001 Hong Kong population census. For the purpose of the present study, the adolescent subsample of the larger study was used for subsequent data analyses. Among these adolescents (n = 230), 43.5% were male and 56.5% were female. Their mean age was 15.35 years (SD = 2.15), with the age distribution being 10% for 11\u201313 years, 52.2% for 14\u201316 years, and 37.8% for 17\u201318 years.

For adolescents, cues to action are the most effective when they are also built into their social networks such as peers, family, and school systems [33].

These findings may be explained by individuals\u2019 deliberate evaluation process. Most psychosocial models, including the HBM, suggest that deliberate evaluation of the threat related to the disease as well as benefits, barriers, and cues surrounding specific health behaviors are crucial in predicting whether or not an individual practices a certain health behavior [12], [36], [37]. In this study, consistent facemask-wearing was novel to most Chinese adolescents in Hong Kong and required active evaluation of these psychosocial factors before they decided to practice such behavior.

As pointed out by some researchers [38], different health behaviors may be interrelated to influence health. For example, smoking may reduce the desire to exercise, and intense exercise may affect food intake; whereas eating nutritious food does not necessarily preclude an individual from eating \u201cjunk\u201d food. Similarly, increases in the practice of one type of health behavior may facilitate adherence to other health behaviors.

There might also be doubts about the validity of responses by telephone interviews. However, previous studies have documented the similarity of responses between telephone and face-to-face interviews [39], and telephone interviews have become an increasingly acceptable methodology in collecting estimates of health behaviors [40]. Third, the measurement of the target SARS preventive behaviors was crude and without any contextual information. It was possible that adolescents\u2019 practice of SARS preventive behaviors might differ at home, in school, or in public places. Lastly, this study focused on core components of the HBM in understanding the practice of SARS preventive health behaviors.
