He was hypotensive and tachycardic with an acute kidney injury. Prior to this presentation, he had been hospitalized for 2 weeks at a nearby hospital with similar symptoms and had been found to have multifocal ground glass opacities on CT of the chest. His condition after admission improved with fluid resuscitation, stress-dose steroids, and treatment for presumed sepsis. Infectious and rheumatologic workups were negative. He was noted to have bilateral pulmonary infiltrates (Fig. 79.1a, b). One week after discharge, however, he presented again with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). A bronchoscopy revealed only acute and chronic organizing pneumonia, with no evidence of infection. A bone marrow biopsy was performed, which demonstrated a hypercellular marrow. Pulse dose steroids were initiated for organizing pneumonia and he improved significantly over the next week with continuation of empiric antimicrobials and tapering of steroids. After 1 week of this regimen, however, he again decompensated with hypoxia and hypotension. Worsening infiltrates were noted on his chest radiograph (Fig. 79.1c). Ferritin was elevated at 7652 ng/mL, and sIL-2R was elevated at 3432 U/mL. Trigylcerides were normal and fibrinogen was elevated. Given his unremarkable bone marrow biopsy 7 days before and elevated fibrinogen, the possibility of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) was dismissed as his hyperferritinemia and elevated sIL-2R were attributed to history of blood transfusion and occult infection. He continued to improve with empiric antimicrobials and steroids, and was discharged from the hospital 5 days after admission to the ICU to complete a course of levofloxacin on 40 mg of prednisone daily.\n",

He was admitted to the ICU and his pulmonary status rapidly improved. After 3 days, however, he again decompensated with hypotension and an elevated lactate. He received intravenous fluids and intravenous steroids. Given the unclear association between changes in his antimicrobial regimen, steroid dosing, and clinical condition, his steroid dose was decreased from 40 mg prednisone daily by 10 mg each day. A repeat bone marrow biopsy was performed, which showed rare hemophagocytic macrophages but no evidence of malignancy. The next day, in the setting of reducing his steroid dose, he again had an episode of hypoxia and hypotension. Ferritin was measured at that time and was 9148 ng/mL, increased from 4074 ng/mL the day before (Fig. 79.2). sIL2-R was measured and was elevated at 3494 U/mL. A diagnosis of HLH was made, and he was started on chemotherapy with etoposide and high dose dexamethasone. Eight weeks had elapsed since his initial presentation.\n",

As many as 2 out of 3 patients with HLH will present with severe coagulation disorders including disseminated intravascular coagulation and hypofibrinoginemia, many with associated severe bleeding [6]. As illustrated in the case above, in our experience rapid fluctuating hemodynamic instability and hypoxic respiratory failure are also common features resulting from the abnormal inflammatory response. These presenting symptoms and laboratory findings overlap significantlywith severe sepsis. It is not uncommon for adult patients with HLH to have recently been hospitalized for presumed sepsis, and HLH is entertained as a diagnosis after one or more unexplained relapses. The most important step in recognizing HLH in the critically ill patient, therefore, is to consider it in the differential diagnosis alongside more common causes of shock and respiratory failure.",

The search for appropriate biomarkers, then, remains an area of active and important investigation, as detailed below.

Long-term follow-up of the HLH-2004 trial suggested that intensified cyclosporine regimens and the addition of intrathecal steroids with reduced time to HSCT did not improve outcome significantly in the pediatric population [10]. Etoposide and dexamethasone have become the mainstay of treatment in adult patients with HLH. Anti-thymocyte globulin has also been used in combination with steroids, cyclosporine and intrathecal chemotherapy [11]. A recent consensus review on malignancy-associated HLH suggests tailoring treatment to the underlying trigger, performance status, organ function and additional therapies the patient is receiving [12]. Earlyconsultation with a hematologist and center experienced in the treatment of HLH is critical, both because immunomodulatory therapy for HLH is an area of active investigation, and because bone marrow transplantation is considered the curative therapy for patient with a known or suspected genetic cause of HLH.",

The most comprehensive longitudinally studied cohort of patients with HLH was enrolled in the HLH-1994 study, which exclusively studied children under age 16 [13]. In this cohort, cumulative 5-year mortality was 46%, with 25% mortality within 8 weeks of diagnosis. Survival was 66% among those patients who underwent HSCT. HLH in adults is far more likely to be secondary than HLH in the pediatric population, though late presentations of primary HLH are possible [3]. Among critically ill patients who receive etoposide for treatment of HLH, a near 50% survival rate has been reported [14]. A multi-center seven-year series of 68 adult HLH cases described a median overall survival of 4 months [15]. While survival to discharge in manyadult cohorts mirrors the pediatric population, long-term mortality in secondary HLH may be more reflective of underlying malignancy [16, 17].",

In a single center descriptive study, the worst prognosis was found in patients with malignancy associated HLH and extreme hyperferritinemia with a median survival of 7 months [19]. In a North American tertiary care center, patients with HLH secondary to causes other than malignancy had a median survival of 48 months, compared to less than 2 months in cases associated with malignancy [20]. Severity of illness at the time of diagnosis of HLH also appears to bear on outcome despite treatment, with thrombocytopenia, marked hyperferritinemia, and shock at ICU admission associated with mortality [14, 20]. In a single center study of 162 patients with HLH, in multivariate analyses age, lymphoma, decreasing platelet count and not having etoposide administered as part oftreatment were all associated with increased mortality [21].",

In patients diagnosed with HLH, ferritin levels reflect disease course and activity, and in children a marked decrease in ferritin (>96%) portends decreased short term mortality during HLH treatment [25]. In critically ill adults, however, the increased prevalence of conditions which elevate ferritin, such as infection, malignancy, autoimmune disease, liver injury and chronic blood transfusion make hyperferritinemia a nonspecific finding for HLH [26, 27]. Only 3% of hospitalized patients with elevated ferritin levels (>2000 ng/mL) will have a diagnosis of HLH; patients are more likely to have liver injury or infection with elevated ferritin alone [28].",

Therefore, diagnosis relies on exclusion of other etiologies that may cause multi-lobar infiltrates and respiratory failure. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) should be performed and tested for common bacterial (including acid-fast bacilli, Nocardia, Legionella) and non-bacterial (CMV, RSV, PCP, HSV, VZV, influenza, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, HHV6, Chlamydia, Mycoplasma and Aspergillus) organisms [50]. The importance of this testing is emphasized by the fact that 57% of BAL specimens from IPS patients had detectable bacterial or viral pathogens using modern techniques [53]. Thus, lower respiratory tract sampling may be one of the most important diagnostics an intensivist can offer. To reach a diagnosis of IPS, patients must also have anabsence of cardiac dysfunction, acute renal failure or iatrogenic fluid overload contributing to their pulmonary dysfunction.",

Response rates in recent clinical trials were 67% for high dose steroids, with a median time to response of 7 days [54]. Steroid treatment is typically with 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone equivalents continued intravenous for the three days with subsequent oral dosing and then tapering after day 7. The TNF\u03b1 binding protein etanercept has been used in combination with steroids, demonstrating improvements in response to therapy and early survival in small single center studies [55\u201357]. In 2014 a phase III clinical trial of adult IPS, etanercept did not provide additional benefit over steroids alone, though enrollment in this trial was prematurely ended and definitive conclusions regarding use of etanercept in IPS cannot be made from this trial alone. Notably, etanercept use was not associated withincreased risk of opportunistic infection or malignancy relapse compared with placebo controls. Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use has been reported in both early and late IPS, though its efficacy and impact on outcomes is unclear [58, 59]. For patients who do not respond to steroids and anti-TNF\u03b1 therapies the treatment is also unclear. IL-6 is elevated in the plasma of patients with IPS [60] and it has been suggested that the IL-6 inhibitor, tocilizumab, may have some benefit in treating or preventing IPS [61].",
