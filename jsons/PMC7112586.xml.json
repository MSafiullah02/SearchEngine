Research was conducted from the year 1973 through 2011. Used research terms included \u201cAspergillus meningitis\u201d, \u201ccerebral aspergillosis\u201d, \u201ccentral nervous system aspergillosis\u201d, \u201cAspergillus arachnoiditis\u201d, \u201cmycotic meningitis\u201d. For the purpose of this review a case of meningitis or meningoencephalitis caused by Aspergillus spp. was defined during life as follows: 1) a cerebrospinal culture positive for Aspergillus spp. together with a meningeal or encephalic syndrome; 2) the presence of galactomannan antigen or Aspergillus DNA detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test in the CSF, together with a meningeal syndrome. Post-mortem diagnoses of Aspergillus meningitis were included if the autopsy clearly indicated involvement of the meninges or a picture of meningitis with microscopic identification of Aspergillus hyphae or a positive Aspergillus culture. When inflammation involved the spinal leptomeninges the case was classified as spinal arachnoiditis. Patients were considered immunocompromised if the following conditions were met: 1) HIV/AIDS infection; 2) solid organ transplantation; 3) hematologic diseases with or without bone marrow transplantation; 4) autoimmune diseases treated with steroids or other immunosuppressive drugs; 5) diabetes mellitus; 6) any other condition treated with corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs.",

            "text": "A 34-year-old man was referred to our Infectious Diseases ward on February 9, 2010 from a Neurosurgery Unit where a diagnosis of Aspergillus meningitis had been made (Fig. 1\n). The clinical history was notable for heroin intravenous drug abuse, high alcohol intake, untreated chronic hepatitis C and methadone maintenance therapy (50 mg/day). One month before he was admitted to the Internal Medicine ward of another Hospital to investigate the nature of low back pain, headache and low grade fever (37.5 \u00b0C) that had appeared 1 month earlier. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was negative for parenchimal and meningeal lesions. On the contrary, MRI of the lumbar spine showed abnormal contrast enhancement into the spinal canal between L4 and S1 suggesting an intradural mass lesion conditioning a traction effect on the roots of the cauda equina. A color-doppler echocardiogram showed only a mild mitral regurgitation. Blood and urine cultures were negative as well as a serologic test for HIV. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis performed on February 9 is shown in Fig. 1. Gram and Ziehl-Neelsen stains, as well as bacterial and mycobacterial cultures, were negative as was the search for bacterial and Cryptococcus neoformans antigens. Cerebrospinal culture grew Aspergillus flavus that was susceptible to amphotericin B, voriconazole, posaconazole, itraconazole and caspofungin. Aspergillus galactomannan antigen-GM (Platelia Aspergillus, Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur, Marne-La Coquette, France) was detected both in the CSF and blood with a higher index value in the former (respectively, 7.4 and 2.5). Upon admission to our ward (February 12), the patient had fever (38.5 \u00b0C), was alert and complained of frontal headache and photophobia, without neck stiffness. Intravenous treatment with voriconazole was started (6 mg/kg every 12 h (q12h) as loading dose, followed by 4 mg/kg q12h) together with ceftriaxone (2 g q12). Two weeks later, a control brain and spinal MRI showed meningeal enhancement with cysternal distribution especially in the pre-pontine area around the basilar artery, together with endocanalar pathologic enhancement between L4 and S2 (Figure 2, Figure 3\na and b). A concomitant CSF analysis showed a reduction of WBCs (180/\u03bcL, 61% PMNs), improvement of glucose levels (24 mg/dL, serum 110 mg/dL) and a striking increase of protein level (3705 mg/dl), whereas, at this time point, CSF culture turned negative. The GM index was 6.36 in the CSF and 0.9 in the peripheral blood. Because of persistent fever, headache and worsening of the radiological picture, caspofungin (70 mg loading dose, 50 mg maintenance dose) was added to the antifungal regimen with discontinuation of the antibiotic therapy. Voriconazole blood and CSF trough concentrations obtained after 2 weeks of therapy were similar (5.85 and 5.86 mg/L, respectively). Therapeutic drug monitoring was arranged 6 and 10 days later and it showed toxic concentrations of the drug that prompted dosage adjustments despite the absence of any clinical or biochemical signs of voriconazole toxicity. Another CSF examination performed on March 18, disclosed an improvement of all parameters (Fig. 1). Repeated MRI of the brain and spine (March, 17) showed the reduction of the pial and cysternal contrast enhancement but a progression of the endocanalar inflammation now involving the segments L3 to S2. After a new evaluation by the neurosurgery consultant, who deemed any procedure unfeasible, the patient was discharged after having received 38 days of voriconazole therapy (total cumulative dosage: 21,200 mg) and one month of caspofungin (total cumulative dosage:1520 mg). The patient was left on maintenance therapy with oral voriconazole at a dosage of 150 mg q12 due to raised ALT levels (199 U/L), the appearance of visual disturbances and persistently elevated trough voriconazole concentrations (6.2 mg/L). At the end of April, the patient was readmitted to our hospital ward because of persistent abnormal liver function test results and visual disturbances that required discontinuation of voriconazole and its substitution with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB, 250 mg/day). He complained of persistent low back pain that was irradiated to both the lower extremities with preserved deep tendon and superficial reflexes. Repeated attempts to obtain CSF samples by lumbar puncture were unsuccessful. Nerve conduction and electromyography studies showed mild sensorimotor bilateral demyelinating polyneuropathy. A new MRI of the brain and spine (performed on May, 17) was substantially unchanged. During the 30-day therapy with L-AMB, GM was evaluated weekly and showed values ranging from 0.9 to 1.59. Because of the patient's drug addiction history, it was decided to resume oral voriconazole therapy since the positioning of a permanent intravenous device for L-AMB infusion on an outpatient basis was judged risky. A dosage of 150 mg every 12 h was started on June 9, showing after a week trough and peak concentrations of 3.4 and 3.6 mg/L, respectively. A new MRI of the brain and spine was performed on August 4, that demonstrated a reduction of pial enhancement along the cervical tract, the conus medullaris and cauda equina with a only a mild volumetric reduction of the endocanalar lumbar abscess. Clinically, the patient was well oriented with a positive bilateral Las\u00e8gue sign at the neurologic examination. He was discharged and subsequently lost to follow-up.",

            "text": "In almost half of the cases (n = 44) Aspergillus was identified by histology or culture without speciation; all other infections were caused by A. fumigatus (n = 34), A. flavus (n = 8) and A. terreus (n = 3) while A. oryzae, A. granulosus and A. candidus were identified in one case each. Forty-one patients were considered immunocompromised hosts (5 AIDS patients; 3 with autoimmune diseases treated with steroids; 9 solid organ transplant recipients; 10 hematologic patients undergoing chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation; 5 subjects under steroid therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; 7 patients with diabetes and, finally, 1 each with Cushing's disease and sarcoidosis). In the fifty-two patients without classic risk factors for invasive aspergillosis, central nervous system involvement was presumed to be the result of: direct extension of Aspergillus from the orbit, ear or paranasal sinuses in 6 patients (11.5%); iatrogenic direct inoculation of Aspergillus through spinal anesthesia (13 patients, 25%), neurosurgery (13 patients, 25%) or epidural steroid injections (1 patient). In six intravenous drug abusers (11.5%) the infection was probably acquired by the hematogenous route. Among the remaining subjects, no predisposing factor could be identified in six patients while one patient each were notable for the presence of the following: pregnancy, alcohol abuse, fungal endocarditis and near drowning. The most common syndrome was acute meningitis which was observed in 46 patients, followed by meningoencephalitis (n = 23). A chronic course of meningitis was observed in 15 patients; five patients showed a picture of spinal arachnoiditis (in 1 case with associated meningitis), and 4 ventriculitis (Table 2). An acute course characterized by rapid deterioration of the clinical picture usually ending with death was observed among immunocompromised hosts and in patients who had direct inoculation of the fungus into the cerebrospinal fluid or the subarachnoid space. By contrast, a sub-acute or chronic form of meningitis going unrecognized for several weeks and sometimes displaying a relapsing character was the most frequent presentation among immunocompetent patients, intravenous drug abusers and patients with diabetes. However, the latter clinical picture was also observed among several patients who had undergone neurosurgery.",

In fact, a diagnosis during life was obtained only in 55.9% of patients although with a much higher frequency among immunocompetent patients (69.2%)3, 6, 10, 12, 13, 15, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 29, 32, 33, 39, 44, 45, 47, 52, 54, 56, 58, 63, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 76, 78, 79\nPR as opposed to immunocompromised individuals (39%).5, 9, 28, 29, 34, 36, 40, 42, 46, 48, 55, 59, 74 This difference might be explained by a more aggressive and acute course of the disease observed in immunosuppressed hosts. A culture-based diagnosis of Aspergillus meningitis is hampered by the lack of sensitivity as shown by the 31% of positive results observed in our review of published cases.3, 9, 13, 22, 23, 25, 26, 29, 33, 35, 37, 40, 45, 52, 53, 54, 56, 70\nPR It has been previously suggested that a minimum of 5 mL of cerebrospinal fluid should be cultured when a mycosis is suspected or that repeated culture of large volumes of CSF are critical for successful in vitro isolation. However, such large volumes are not easy to obtain in clinical practice.80 On the other hand, serial lumbar puncture does indeed seem to have a role since in 9 cases, the fungus could be successfully isolated from cerebrospinal fluid only after several attempts.3, 25, 26, 29, 35, 37, 40, 45\n",

It is characterized by CSF neutrophil pleocytosis in 68% of cases and hypoglycorrhachia in 62% of cases. Cultures of CSF are positive only in one third of cases, but the GM antigen test is very useful, with a sensitivity reaching 87%. Although our data show a poor prognosis, we believe that the more widespread use of diagnostic methods with greater sensitivity (i.e., PCR and GM), together with the availability of voriconazole therapy, may allow improved outcomes provided that the diagnosis is achieved earlier. The optimal length of antifungal therapy however remains to be determined.",
