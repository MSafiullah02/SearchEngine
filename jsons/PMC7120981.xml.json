The in vitro packaging reaction works not only with one genome but also with any DNA molecule that carries cos site separated by 37\u201352 kb of DNA. It also needs a selectable marker, such as ampicillin resistance gene, and a plasmid origin of replication, as cosmids lack all the \u03bb genes, therefore do not produce plaques. Instead colonies are formed on selective media, just as with a plasmid vector. The loading capacity of cosmids varies depending on the size of the vector itself but usually lies around 40\u201345 kb\u2014much more than a phage \u03bb vector can accommodate. After packaging in vitro, the particle is used to infect suitable host. The recombinant cosmid DNA is injected into the cell where it circularizes like phage DNA but replicates as a normal plasmid without the expression of any phage functions. Transformed cells are selected on the basis of a vector drug resistance marker. The construct of a typical cosmid vector is shown in Fig. 1.1.\n",

            "text": "Cosmids provide an efficient means of cloning large pieces of DNA. Because of their capacity to carry large fragments of DNA, cosmids are particularly attractive for constructing libraries of eukaryotic genome fragments. Partial digestion with a restriction endonuclease provided suitably large fragments. However, there is potential problem associated with use of partial digests in this way. This is due to the possibility of two or more genome fragments joining together in the ligation reaction, hence creating a clone containing fragments that were not initially adjacent in the genome. The problem can be overcome by the size fractionation and dephosphorylation of the foreign DNA fragments so as to prevent their ligation together. But this method is very sensitive to the exact ratio of target-to-vector DNAs because vector-to-vector ligation \ncan occur. Such difficulties have been overcome in a cosmid-cloning procedure devised by Ish-Horowicz and Burke (1981). By appropriate treatment of the cosmid vector pJB8, left-hand and right-hand vector ends are purified which are incapable of self-ligation but which accept dephosphorylated foreign DNA. Thus, the method eliminates the need to size the foreign DNA fragments and prevents formation of clones containing short foreign DNA or multiple vector sequences. Figure 1.2 describes the cosmid-cloning procedure devised by Ish-Horowicz and Burke (1981).\n",

Chimerism may be due to either coligation of multiple genomic segments into a single YAC, or recombination of two or more YACs transformed in the same host yeast cell. The incidence of chimerism may be as high as 50 %. Other artifacts are deletion of segments from a cloned region, and rearrangement of genomic segments (such as inversion). In all these cases, the sequence as determined from the YAC clone is different from the original, natural sequence, leading to inconsistent results, and errors in interpretation if the clone\u2019s information is relied upon.
