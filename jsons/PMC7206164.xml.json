Many factors have different influences on the stock price, and it is essential to extract a list of crucial factors from both historical stock prices and other data sources. As there is no such thing as a free lunch, investors have to find an efficient strategy for a trade-off between getting more profits and reducing the investment risk. Sometimes, they need to invest multiple assets for diversifying the portfolio.",

There are popular techniques, including autoregressive moving average (ARMA) [3], autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) [4], and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) [5]. Importantly, these statistical methods usually consider the stock time series as a linear process and then model the generation process for a latent time series to foresee future stock prices. Practically, a stock time series is generally a nonlinear dynamic process. There are many different approaches, including artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), and other ensemble methods [6] to capture nonlinear characters from a given dataset without knowing any prior information. Especially, deep neural networks such as e.g. convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) have been proven to work well in many applications and multi-variable time series data.",

Typically, the stock price of each company listed in a stock market can vary whenever one puts a sell or buy order, and the corresponding transaction completes. Many factors have influenced the stock price of one company, for example, such as the company\u2019s net profit, demand stability, competitive strength in the market, new technology used, and production volume. Also, the macro-economic condition can play a unique role in the stock market as well as the currency exchange rate and the change of the government\u2019s policies. After boasting increased macro-economic stability and improving the pro-business financial environment, Vietnam has become one of the world\u2019s most attractive markets for international investors. With the population of nearly 100 million people and most of whom are young people (under the age of 35), Vietnam can provide a young, motivated, highly skilled, and educated workforce to multiple international startups and enterprises with a competitive cost. At the moment, Vietnam\u2019s stock exchange is considered as one of the most promising and prospective market in the Southeast Asia. Especially, the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange (HOSE)1 is becoming one of the largest securities firms in terms of both capital and size. Since launching in 2002, it has been performing strongly and more and more investors continue exhibiting a special interest in both Vietnam stock market. HOSE is currently predicted to be upgraded to an emerging market in 2021.",

Duy and co-workers combine deep neural networks and Gaussian mixture models for extracting brain tissues from high-resolution magnetic resonance images [7]. Deep neural networks can also be applied to automatic music generation [8], food recognition [9], and portfolio optimization problem [10\u201312]. In this paper, we aim at investigating a portfolio optimization problem in which by using historical stock data of different tickers, one wants to find the equally weighted portfolio having the highest Sharpe ratio [13] in the future. This is one of the winning solutions in a well-known data science competition using the HOSE stock data in 2019. In this competition, one can use one training dataset, including all volume and prices of different tickers appearing in the Vietnam stock market from the beginning of the year 2013 to the middle of the year 2019 (July 2019), for learning an appropriate model of the portfolio optimization problem. It is worth noting that the Sharpe ratio is often used as a measure of the health of a portfolio. One usually expects that the higher the Sharpe ratio of one portfolio is in the past, the larger its Sharpe ratio is in the future. In this work, we assume that there are no new tickers joining the stock market during the testing period.",

Different from other approaches using statistical methods or time series algorithms, we transform the input data into a 3D tensor and then consider each input data as an image. As a result, we have a chance to apply different state-of-the-art methods such as e.g. Residual Networks (ResNet) [14], Long-short term memory(LSTM) [15], Gate Recurrent Unit [16], Self-Attention (SA) [17], and Additive Attention (AA) [18] for extracting important features as well as learning an appropriate model. Also, we compare them with different combinations of these techniques (SA + LSTM, SA + GRU, AA + LSTM, and AA + GRU) and measure the actual performance in the testing dataset. The experimental results show that the AA + LSTM outperforms other techniques in terms of achieving a much better value of the Sharpe ratio and a comparably smaller value of the corresponding standard deviation.",

Moreover, we assume that all investors aim to determine the list of potential tickers in their portfolio for the next K days without putting any weight for different tickers (or equally weighted, such as e.g. 1/N). It is important to note that all the investors usually do not want their portfolios to have a few tickers or \u201cput all the eggs in one bucket\u201d or lack of diversity. Having too many tickers may cost a lot of management time and fee as well. As a consequence, the outcome of the problem can be regarded as an N-binary vector (N is the number of tickers), where a one-valued entry means the corresponding ticker is chosen; otherwise, it is not selected. There are two main constraints in this problem: a) Having the same proportion for each tickers in portfolios; (b) The maximum numbers of tickers selected is 50.",

One of the possible reasons is Additive Attention + GRU can retain the information from the input sequence, which may loose from RNN cells when dealing with a very long sequence. Models using Self Attention can also get good results; however, as the outputs of the Self-Attention module still go to the RNN cell, without keeping any information from the sequence input. For this reason, the mean value of the Sharpe ratio of SA + GRU (0.9047) is a bit lower than AA + GRU (1.1056). Interestingly, the mean value of the Sharpe ratio of SA + LSTM (1.0206) is better than AA + LSTM (0.9235). Although not getting a high Sharpe ration in comparison with SA/AA + LSTM/GRU, the ResNet model has a quite short training time. In our experiments, the total time for its running 10-Fold Cross Validation is only 40 min, while taking over two hours for all SA/AA + LSTM/GRU models. In Fig. 6, our best-proposed model, AA + GRU, has a better performance than both VN303 and VNINDEX4 in terms of the Sharpe ratio values. These experimental results show that our proposed techniques can achieve promising results and possibly apply not only in the Vietnamese stock market but also in other countries (Table 1).\n\n",
