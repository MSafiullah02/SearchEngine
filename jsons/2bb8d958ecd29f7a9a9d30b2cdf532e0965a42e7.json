Objective: We aimed to evaluate the usefulness of PTX-3 as a clinical marker in children with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and examine the correlation of PTX-3 with other biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT). Methods: We enrolled 117 consecutive patients admitted to Seoul St. Mary's Hospital with LRTI using the WHO criteria. We recorded data on fever duration and peak temperature before admission, duration of fever after admission, respiratory rate, heart rate, oxygen saturation upon admission, duration of oxygen supplementation, and duration of hospital stay. Upon admission, white blood cell (WBC) count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, CRP level were measured. Multiplex respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction was performed using nasal swabs. PTX-3, PCT, and various cytokines were measured after the study had been completed. Results: We found that there was no significant difference in the level of PTX-3 according to the type of viral infection. PTX-3 levels showed a significant correlation with PCT levels, but not with levels of CRP. The level of PTX-3 showed a significant correlation with peak temperature and duration of fever before admission as well as interleukin (IL)-6 levels. PCT levels showed a significant correlation with IL-6 and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor levels, peak temperature, and duration of fever before admission, and duration of hospital stay. CRP levels showed a significant correlation with duration of fever before admission, total WBC count, and neutrophil count. PCT levels significantly predicted a hospital stay of 7 days or more. PTX-3, PCT, and CRP levels showed no correlation with any other clinical features. Conclusion: PTX-3 reflected disease severity but failed to predict length of hospital stay.

Many inflammatory markers have been developed to serve this purpose such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and procalcitonin (PCT) levels. 4 Pentraxin 3 (PTX-3) is a novel biomarker that behaves as an acute-phase protein: as its blood levels, which are low in normal conditions (<2 ng/ml in humans, 1.24 ng/ml [0.87-2.08] in children), rapidly increase in the plasma during inflammation (e.g., sepsis, endotoxin shock, and other inflammatory conditions). 5, 6 PTX-3 is released in response to microbial recognition and can bind specific pathogens such as fungi, bacteria, and viruses. 5 A previous study found that plasma PTX-3 levels could be used to diagnose the severity of community acquired pneumonia with higher sensitivity compared to CRP, and also correlated with the length of hospital stay. 7 Another study found that a high concentration of PTX-3 helps to differentiate parapneumonic effusion from non-parapneumonic effusion. 8 However, no study has investigated the value of PTX-3 in viral infection, which is the most common cause of LRTI in children.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 93, "end": 94, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 219, "end": 221, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 222, "end": 223, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 556, "end": 557, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 872, "end": 874, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 875, "end": 876, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1002, "end": 1003, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1218, "end": 1219, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1354, "end": 1355, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of PTX-3 as a clinical marker in LRTI and examine the correlation of PTX-3 with other biomarkers such as CRP and PCT.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "We enrolled 117 consecutive patients with LRTI admitted to the ward from the emergency department or outpatient department using the WHO criteria, that is, patients with fever, cough, a fast respiratory rate for their age, chest in-drawing, and rhonchi or crepitations on auscultation.

[12] [13] [14] We found that the level of PTX-3 reflects disease severity in children with LRTI by showing a significant correlation with the peak temperature and duration of fever before admission. This result was similar to that reported in a previous study which found that plasma PTX-3 levels could be used to diagnose the severity of community acquired pneumonia in adults. 7 We also found that the PCT level reflects disease severity and prognosis in children with LRTI. Our findings support previous studies which reported similar findings. 15, 16 There was a lack of correlation with other clinical signs of disease severity. This might be because the age of the study population and the disease category were different from previous studies which involved rather serious diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and sepsis in adults. 13, 14, 17 There was no difference in PTX-3 levels between those who were found to be infected with a causative agent and those who were not. One possible explanation for this finding is that it might have been due to the limitations of a nasopharyngeal swab: we presume that even patients with no detectable viruses might actually have been infected. 18 Our study also found that PTX-3 levels did not vary depending on the types of virus causing infection. This is because PTX-3 acts as a part of the innate immune system as a pattern recognition molecule. PTX-3 is also involved in resistance against some viral infections. 5 PTX-3 binds both human and murine cytomegalovirus (HCMV and MCMV, respectively) and reduces the viral infection of dendritic cells in vitro. 19 Accordingly, ptx3 -/mice present a higher susceptibility to infections than wild-type mice, and the viral titer is reduced upon treatment with recombinant PTX-3. 19 Moreover, PTX-3 protects MCMV-infected mice from Aspergillus fumigatus superinfection and enhances the production of IL-12 and IFN-g by dendritic cells and T cells, respectively. 19 Finally, human and murine PTX-3 binds influenza virus (H3N2) through interaction between viral hemagglutinin glycoprotein and the sialic acid residue present on PTX-3. 20 PTX-3 inhibits virus-induced hemagglutination and viral neuraminidase activity and neutralizes virus infectivity. 20 Treatment with recombinant PTX-3 reduces mortality and viral load. 20 Further study will be needed to discover the differential effect of PTX-3 on different types of virus in vivo.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 147, "end": 151, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 152, "end": 156, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 157, "end": 161, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 526, "end": 527, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 695, "end": 698, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 699, "end": 701, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1027, "end": 1030, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1031, "end": 1034, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1035, "end": 1037, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1796, "end": 1798, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1961, "end": 1963, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2143, "end": 2145, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2431, "end": 2433, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2501, "end": 2503, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Our study found that PTX-3 level correlated with IL-6 levels.
