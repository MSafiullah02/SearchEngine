            "text": "Identifying viral antagonists of innate immunity and determining if they contribute to pathogenesis are critical for developing effective strategies to control emerging viruses. Previously, we reported that an endoribonuclease (EndoU) encoded by murine coronavirus plays a pivotal role in evasion of host innate immune defenses in macrophages. Here, we asked if the EndoU activity of porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PEDV), which causes acute diarrhea in swine, plays a role in antagonizing the innate response in porcine epithelial cells and macrophages, the sites of viral replication. We constructed an infectious clone of PEDV-Colorado strain (icPEDV-wt) and an EndoU-mutant PEDV (icPEDV-EnUmt) by changing the codon for a catalytic histidine residue of EndoU to alanine (His226Ala). We found that both icPEDV-wt and icPEDV-EnUmt propagated efficiently in interferon (IFN)-deficient Vero cells. In contrast, the propagation of icPEDV-EnUmt was impaired in porcine epithelial cells (LLC-PK1), where we detected an early and robust transcriptional activation of type I and type III IFNs. Infection of piglets with the parental Colorado strain, icPEDV-wt, or icPEDV-EnUmt revealed that all viruses replicated in the gut and induced diarrhea; however, there was reduced viral shedding and mortality in the icPEDV-EnUmt-infected animals. These results demonstrate that EndoU activity is not required for PEDV replication in immortalized, IFN-deficient Vero cells, but is important for suppressing the IFN response in epithelial cells and macrophages, which facilitates replication, shedding, and pathogenesis in vivo. We conclude that PEDV En-doU activity is a key virulence factor that suppresses both type I and type III IFN responses. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) can emerge from an animal reservoir into a naive host species to cause pandemic respiratory or gastrointestinal diseases with significant mortality in humans or domestic animals. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an alphacoronavirus (alpha-CoV), infects gut epithelial cells and macrophages, inducing diarrhea and resulting in high mortality in piglets. How PEDV suppresses the innate immune response was unknown. We found that mutating a viral endoribonuclease, EndoU, results in a virus that activates both the type I interferon response and the type III interferon response in macrophages and epithelial cells. This activation of interferon resulted in limited viral replication in epithelial cell cultures and was associated with reduced virus shedding and mortality in piglets. This study reveals a role for EndoU activity as a virulence factor in PEDV infection and provides an approach for generating live-attenuated vaccine candidates for emerging coronaviruses.",

            "text": "Generating an infectious clone of PEDV-Colorado strain and an EndoU-mutant PEDV. To investigate if PEDV EndoU acts as an IFN antagonist in porcine cells, we generated an infectious clone of PEDV and an EndoU-deficient mutant virus using a previously described strategy (27) with minor modifications (Fig. 1 , see details in Materials and Methods). Briefly, three synthetic DNA fragments were generated based on the PEDV-Colorado genomic RNA sequence (28) . These synthetic DNAs were used as the template for PCR amplification of five segments that were then cloned into plasmid vector backbones. The promoter sequence of T7 RNA polymerase and a poly(A) tail were inserted at the 5= and 3= ends of the genome, respectively. In addition, the sequence of the N gene was amplified and cloned into a pcDNA3.1 vector that carries a T7 promoter sequence. To rescue the virus, the five PEDV DNA fragments were digested from their vectors and ligated in vitro. The ligated DNA and linearized N gene plasmid DNA were used as the templates for in vitro RNA transcription reactions to yield full-length genomic RNA and N gene transcripts. These RNA transcripts were mixed and coelectroporated into Vero cells, where they were translated into viral proteins to initiate the replication and assembly of infectious particles of PEDV. Initially, no syncytia-like cytopathic effects (CPE) were observed in the electroporated cells, nor were CPE detected upon passage of the supernatant from the electroporated cells. However, using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), we detected viral leader-containing subgenomic mRNA from the total RNA isolated from electroporated cells, indicating that virus replication was occurring (data not shown). Similar results were reported during the generation of the infectious clone of PEDV-PC22A, with no CPE detected in cell culture but with clear evidence of virus production, since supernatant could be used to induce disease in piglets (29) . For PEDV-PC22A, Hou et al. found that insertion of a trinucleotide into the spike sequence, resulting in replacement of aspartic acid by a glycine residue, and the addition of a histidine residue (D466GH), resulted in development of CPE during PEDV infection in Vero cells (30) . Since the Colorado and PC22A strains share 99% identity in the spike region, we reasoned that introducing the D466GH mutation into the spike sequence of the Colorado strain spike sequence would induce CPE in Vero cells. As expected, within 24 to 48 h postelectroporation, syncytialike CPE was detected in Vero cells electroporated with the in vitro synthesized RNA ( Fig. 2A) . The virus recovered from the supernatant was designated infectious clone wild type, icPEDV-wt. Similarly, we generated an EndoU-deficient mutant, designated icPEDV-EnUmt, by introducing a His-to-Ala substitution (H226A) of the catalytic residue of nsp15 (Fig. 1) . These viruses were passaged in Vero cells, and the expression of N protein was detected by immunofluorescence using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)conjugated anti-N monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2B) . The genome sequence of each virus was confirmed by Illumina high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated from virus particles. The consensus sequence was found to have no additional mutations other than those described above.",

The results show that icPEDV-wt exhibited similar replication kinetics to those of the parental Colorado strain (Fig. 2C) , indicating that the change in the spike sequence did not alter PEDV replication in Vero cells.

Porcine kidney epithelial cells, LLC-PK1 (ATCC CL101), termed PK1 cells, are a porcine kidney epithelial cell line that has been used for isolating and propagating porcine CoVs (31) and are permissive to PEDV infection (32) . To determine if this cell line can sense and respond to dsRNA, we transfected these cells with a dsRNA mimic, poly(I:C). We detected significant transcriptional expression of IFN-\u2424 and IFN-3 mRNA (Fig. 3A) and ISGs (Fig. 3B ) at 16 h posttransfection, compared to that in mock-transfected cells. These results demonstrate that PK1 cells are capable of detecting and responding to cytoplasmic dsRNA molecules. Next, we evaluated the kinetics of IFN activation after infection with icPEDV-wt or icPEDV-EnUmt. PK1 cells were mock-infected or infected with the indicated virus at a dose of 0.1 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID 50 ) per cell. The mRNA levels of IFN-\u2424, IFN-3, the PEDV nucleocapsid (N) gene, and the porcine glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene were evaluated using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) at different hours postinfection (hpi) (8, 12, 24 , and 32 hpi). We found that in icPEDVwt-infected cells, the relative mRNA level of IFN-3 was not significantly changed at the tested time points, and the IFN-\u2424 mRNA was detected at a low level until late time points of infection (24 and 32 hpi). In contrast, icPEDV-EnUmt infection activated an earlier and more robust IFN response, as revealed by elevated levels of IFN-\u2424 mRNA as early as 8 hpi, and IFN-3 at 24 hpi ( Fig. 3C and D). We also evaluated viral replication by monitoring levels of PEDV N gene mRNA and production of progeny virus. The N gene mRNA expression in icPEDV-EnUmt-infected cells was significantly reduced at late times postinfection (24 and 32 hpi) (Fig. 3E ). We found a significantly reduced titer of icPEDV-EnUmt at 32 and 48 hpi, compared to those for icPEDV-wt (Fig. 3F ).",

PEDV replication can be detected in macrophage-like cells within Peyer's patches and lymph nodes of infected animals (24) (25) (26) . PEDV has also been shown to infect primary porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) in vitro, although replication is minimal in these cultured cells (33) . Therefore, to determine if EndoU activity plays a role in controlling the IFN response in primary macrophages, we infected PAMs with either icPEDV-wt or icPEDV-EnUmt at a dose of 0.1 TCID 50 per cell and assessed the mRNA levels of IFN-\u2423, IFN-\u2424 and IFN-3. As shown in Fig. 5 , we observed significantly elevated production of IFN-\u2424 mRNA levels, 200-to 500-fold higher than those of mock-infected or icPEDV-wtinfected cells at 6 and 12 hpi, respectively (Fig. 5A) . We also detected elevated levels of IFN-\u2423 mRNA (Fig. 5B ) in cells infected with the icPEDV-EnUmt compared to the levels seen in icPEDV-wt-infected cells. The IFN-3 mRNA level was slightly elevated (2-fold) at 24 hpi in icPEDV-EnUmt-infected cells, but there was no statistically significant difference between wild-type (WT)-infected and EndoU mutant-infected PAMs (Fig. 5C ). We note that both WT-and EnUmt-infected PAMs exhibited minimal elevation (2-fold) of N gene expression at 24 hpi (Fig. 5D) , consistent with very low levels of virus replication in cultured PAMs (33) . We also found that mRNA levels of ISG54 and OAS1 were significantly increased in icPEDV-EnUmt-infected PAMs compared to those in icPEDV-wt-infected PAMs ( Fig. 5E and F). These results together indicate that EndoU activity antagonizes the type I IFN response during PEDV infection in primary macrophages.",

We compared the pathogenicity in piglets of the parental PEDV-Colorado strain with that of the infectious clone viruses. At 7 days of age, eight piglets in a litter were orally inoculated with one of the three viruses (10 5 TCID 50 per pig). Piglets were monitored daily for clinical symptoms, and daily rectal swabs were collected to evaluate fecal shedding of virus particles. We found that all virus-inoculated piglets manifested with diarrhea and exhibited similar clinical symptoms during the 7-day experimental course, with the icPEDV-EnUmt-infected piglets exhibiting slightly reduced clinical scores at days 3 to 5 (Fig. 6A) . Interestingly, although icPEDV-EnUmt-inoculated piglets exhibited a similar disease progression as the WT-infected animals, we found that the icPEDV-EnUmt-infected piglets had significantly reduced viral shedding on days 3 and 6, and trended toward reduced shedding at all time points tested (Fig. 6B) . Importantly, there was no mortality in the icPEDV-EnUmt infected piglets, compared to 50% (4/8) and 62.5% (5/8) mortality in the icPEDV-wt and PEDV-Colorado parental strain infected piglets, respectively (Fig. 6C) . We performed histopathologic examination of sections of the small intestine in six pigs from the PEDV parental strain-infected group, seven pigs from the icPEDV-EnUmt-infected group and six pigs from the icPEDVwt-infected group. Lesions consisted of villus atrophy and fusion and accumulation of inflammatory cells within the lamina propria, primarily lymphocytes and plasma cells, and crypt hyperplasia. Mucosal epithelium in affected sections of intestine was cuboidal to tall columnar, and there was mild exocytosis of inflammatory cells. Lesions were present in one or more intestinal sections from all affected pigs and were most pronounced within sections of jejunum and ileum. We report that lesion severity was not significantly different in affected pigs among the three virusinfected groups; however, individual variation was observed in all groups. Representative images of ileum sections from an age-matched, uninfected piglet and from one piglet per virus-infected group are shown in Fig. 7 , upper panel. To determine if the sites of virus replication were similar in all infected animals, we performed immunohistochemistry to detect PEDV nucleocapsid protein. Similarly to previous studies (24) (25) (26) , viral antigen was detected in epithelial cells, and we found that the sites of replication of the engineered viruses were essentially identical to those found with PEDV-Colorado (Fig. 7, lower panel) .

Consistent with previous studies of murine coronavirus (12, 13) , we found that both wild-type and the EndoU-mutant PEDV replicate efficiently in interferon deficient Vero cells. However, the loss of EndoU activity correlated with activation of type I (IFN-\u2423/IFN-\u2424) and type III (IFN-) IFN responses in macrophages and epithelial cells, and reduced viral titer in PK1 cells. These results are also in line with those of previous reports indicating that replication of SARS-CoV is enhanced in mice lacking the IFNreceptor (34, 35) and that PEDV replication can be inhibited by treatment of IFN-in epithelial cells (36, 37) .

It is important to note that infection with wild-type PEDV does elicit IFN responses from epithelial cells and macrophages, but the timing of the IFN response is delayed and the magnitude of IFN levels is lower than that in PEDV-EndoU mutant virus infection (Fig. 3) . The earlier IFN response elicited by icPEDV-EnUmt infection results in the transcription of a series of ISGs that are known to induce an antiviral state and thereby limit propagation of the invading pathogen. We also report detection of reduced virus shedding and mortality in piglets infected with icPEDV-EnUmt compared to that in piglets infected with the isogenic wild-type strain ( Fig. 6B and C). These results suggest that activation of an early innate immune response alters virus replication and pathogenesis, but additional in vivo research is needed to fully investigate this issue. For example, the in vivo response to CoV infection may differ, depending on the dose of the virus and the age of the animal. It will also be important to evaluate the frequency of reversion of EndoU mutants and to employ strategies to make these viruses recombination resistant (38) . It is possible that the pathology we detected at day 7 in the icPEDV-EnUmt-infected animals could be generated by revertant viruses (Fig. 7) . Future studies using viruses containing multiple mutations in EndoU, which are thus less likely to revert, should be evaluated at multiple time points to determine the extent of virus replication and the local immune response. For coronaviruses that encode multiple IFN antagonists, it will be interesting to evaluate the role of each antagonist on the type I and type III IFN responses and to determine if inactivating a constellation of antagonists, perhaps both the highly conserved nonstructural protein antagonists and accessory proteins, may be necessary to fully attenuate endemic and emerging strains (29, 39, 40) .",

            "text": "Evaluating type III IFN responses in epithelial cells is particularly important for hepatotropic, respiratory, and enterotropic viruses. Previous studies revealed cell type specific differences in the innate immune response and the key role of peroxisomes in activating IFNin response to viral infection. Viral infection recognized by RIG-I/MDA-5 can signal via mitochondrion-associated mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) to activate interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and transcription of IFN-\u2423/ IFN-\u2424, or alternatively through peroxisome-associated MAVS to activate IRF-1, resulting in activation of IFN-s (41). Hepatitis C virus (HCV) activates both type I and type III IFN responses (42) , but polymorphisms in the IFN-gene loci correlate with HCV disease progression and response to treatment (43) . This genetic association for controlling HCV replication underscores the importance of the type III IFN response during infection. Similarly, a recent study demonstrates that the IFNresponse to influenza virus infection provides a \"front line\" response in the respiratory epithelium to low-dose infection, which facilitates clearance without activation of the type I IFN response (44) . Galani and coauthors provide evidence that limiting the viral infection via the type III IFN response mitigates the role of the more proinflammatory type I IFN response, which can be associated with immunopathology. Enterocyte-tropic viruses, such as rotavirus, reovirus, and norovirus, can be limited by type III IFN responses (45) (46) (47) . Furthermore, IFN-receptor knockout mice (Ifnlr1 \u03ea/\u03ea ) are highly susceptible to these enteric pathogens. Like coronaviruses, some of these viruses encode IFN antagonists to escape the control of the type III IFN response in the gut.",

The EndoU crystal structures of SARS-CoV, mouse hepatitis virus, and MERS-CoV have been solved, clearly placing it into a conserved family of endoribonucleases, and mutagenesis studies have validated the role of the conserved histidine residues as essential for catalytic activity (48) (49) (50) . The nsp15/EndoU protein was shown to localize with other nonstructural proteins and viral RNA in the double membrane vesicles (DMVs) that are thought to protect the viral RNA from recognition by pattern recognition receptors (51) (52) (53) . Initial reports indicated that EndoU activity was essential for coronavirus replication (16) ; however, more recent research, including this study of PEDV EndoU, indicate that is not essential for viral replication. Rather, EndoU activity is important for antagonism of the innate immune response in macrophages (12, 13) and, as shown here, in epithelial cells. Our studies using a murine coronavirus indicate that viral dsRNA is detected outside the protection of DMVs in EndoU mutant virus-infected cells, suggested that EndoU activity may play a role in either sequestering or cleaving dsRNA to prevent recognition by host dsRNA sensors such as MDA-5 (13) . Further studies are needed to determine the mechanism of CoV EndoU activity in limiting the sensing of viral dsRNA.",

            "text": "Construction of an infectious clone of PEDV-Colorado strain. A previously published approach for generation of a CoV reverse genetics system (27) was used to assemble a full-length PEDV cDNA clone. Briefly, the genomic sequence of the Colorado strain was divided into five fragments (PEDV-A to PEDV-E) flanked with unique class II restriction sites that leave nonpalindromic overhangs. These fragments were obtained by PCR amplification from three large synthetic DNAs (GenScript) based on the genomic sequence of the fourth passage of PEDV-Colorado strain in Vero cells and sequenced by the Iowa State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. In the PEDV-A fragment, a promoter sequence of T7 RNA polymerase was added upstream from the sequence of the PEDV 5= untranscribed region (UTR). In the E fragment, two synonymous mutations (A23309G and A23312G) were introduced to disrupt a stretch of six A nucleotides, which might interfere with in vitro RNA transcription reactions. Additionally, three nucleotides (GGC) were inserted into the E fragment at nucleotide site 22030 of the PEDV genome. This insertion resulted in a replacement of aspartate 466 residue with a glycine and a histidine (D466GH) in the spike protein, which was shown to facilitate the cell adaptation of PEDV and recovery of infectious clone virus (30) . The E fragment also contains a poly(A) tail (23 As) at the end of the viral genomic sequence. All five fragments were cloned into the pCR-XL-TOPO vector, amplified in TOP10 bacterial cells, and verified by Sanger sequencing. A large quantity of each PEDV fragment was obtained by digesting the recombinant plasmid DNA using restriction sites designated in Fig. 1 , separating the DNA fragments on a 1% low-melt agarose gel (catalog no. 50111; Lonza), excising the DNA fragment from the gel, and purifying the DNA fragment using a Wizard SV gel extraction kit (catalog no. A9282; Promega). All five PEDV fragments were mixed and ligated overnight at 16\u00b0C using T4 DNA ligase (catalog no. M0202L; New England Biolabs). Ligated fragments were extracted with phenol-chloroform and used as a template for in vitro T7 RNA transcription as instructed in the mMessage mMachine T7 transcription kit (catalog no. AM1344, Life Technologies). In addition, the PEDV nucleocapsid (N) gene was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector containing a T7 promoter sequence. N gene transcripts were generated from the digested N gene fragment using recommended conditions (mMessage mMachine T7 transcription kit). Viral RNA and N gene transcripts were mixed with 800 l of Vero cells (1 \u03eb 10 7 cells/ml) in Opti-MEM (catalog no. 11058021; Gibco) and then added to an electroporation cuvette. Three pulses of 450 V at 50 F were used to electroporate RNA into cells with a Gene Pulser II electroporator (Bio-Rad). The cells were recovered in the cuvette for 10 min at room temperature and then were cultured in a 75-cm 2 flask in growth medium at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 . The growth medium was replaced with FCS-free maintenance medium containing 2 g/ml TPCK-treated trypsin 16 h postelectroporation. Cells were maintained until over 90% of the cell monolayer showed syncytia-like CPE, and then the supernatant was harvested and stored at \u03ea80\u00b0C. To generate an EndoU-deficient PEDV, two nucleotides were mutated (C19390G and A19391C) in fragment D to produce a histidine-to-alanine substitution in nsp15. The mutated D fragment was combined with the other fragments for generation of an EndoU-deficient PEDV. Aliquots of both recombinant viral stocks were sent to the Iowa State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory for full genome sequencing. Except for the mutations described previously, no additional changes were detected.",

To measure mRNA levels from cells, 3 \u03eb 10 5 PK1 cells or 6 \u03eb 10 5 PAMs per well were plated in a 12-well plate 16 h prior to infection. Cells were washed twice with PBS and infected with the indicated virus at a dose of 0.1 TCID 50 per cell in the presence of 5 g/ml trypsin (catalog no. 59427C; Sigma). Cells were harvested at different time points using RLT buffer provided by the RNeasy minikit (catalog no. 74104; Qiagen), and total RNA was extracted as instructed by the manufacturer's protocol. A 500-ng sample of RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using the RT2 HT first strand kit (catalog no. 330411; Qiagen). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using RT2 SYBR green qPCR mix (catalog no. 330502; Qiagen) in the Bio-Rad CFX96 system. The thermocycler was set as follows: one step at 95\u00b0C (10 min), 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C (15 s), 55\u00b0C (1 min) and plate read, one step at 95\u00b0C (10 s), and a melt curve from 65\u00b0C to 95\u00b0C in increments of 0.5\u00b0C/0.05 s.
