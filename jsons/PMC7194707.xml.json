As FIP advocated, \u201ccommunity pharmacies in outbreak-affected and unaffected countries are often the first point of contact with the health system for those with health-related concerns or simply in need of information and reliable advice\u201d.11 Hence, it is important to explore how pharmacists around the world are managing their customary and newly emerging roles during the COVID-19 outbreak. From Macau, China, home of the outbreak, it was documented, from the perspective of the authors, that pharmacists had roles in ensuring the stable supply of key medicines, providing information about the coronavirus infection, performing early detection of cases and appropriate referral, and implementing government arrangement such as the Guaranteed Mask Supply Scheme.10 Another study from China acknowledged that community pharmacy management teams shall support different services by providing adequate supply of COVID-19 related medications and preventative products, in addition to providing sufficient staff trainings.12 From Colombia, community pharmacists were proposed to contribute to the early detection and appropriate referral of possible cases of the virus, then to be reported through designated telephone lines in addition to providing patient education.13 From the United Arab Emirates (UAE), it was stated that pharmacists can also play a role in promoting an empathy culture to help in preventing the stigmatization of infected individuals based on ethnicity, population or nationality, and by broadcasting facts in their communities via various media.14 It is expected that pharmacists around the world are finding their ways to contribute to the collaborative forces in combating the spread of the virus. But for pharmacists to assume a role in humanitarian and health emergency settings, the application of real-world data,10 in addition to the provision of tailored training programs, taking into consideration all aspects, including the psychological impact of such roles, are vital.15\n,\n16 Published research so far provide reference for pharmacists on providing patient care services to improve patient's outcomes and make a contribution to the control of the pandemic. No previous study has looked into pharmacists' own perspective of their role in the management of the coronavirus pandemic, their awareness of important facts needed to be able to deliver their roles successfully, and the source of such facts.",

The first section included items to collect demographics data. The second section included items aimed at assessing potential participants' current epidemics/pandemics and COVID-19 awareness; here potential participating pharmacists were asked about how much they know about the coronavirus, including a) symptoms, b) modes of transmission, c) how to prevent the transmission and the spread of the virus, and d) awareness about where to access the latest coronavirus updates regarding treatment. For each of these sections, there were several detailed items, e.g. participants when asked, for example, were probed about the modes of coronavirus transmission, such as if the virus can be transmitted from the respiratory droplets from person to person among close contacts and after touching surfaces that were contaminated by the virus.19 Other questions investigated participants' awareness regarding the highest risk patients in addition to the symptoms that are associated with coronavirus such as fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches and gastrointestinal symptoms.19 The latest coronavirus updates on treatment were questioned, for example, if hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin have been used as a preventive therapy against coronavirus infection, or if oseltamivir is being used in the management of the coronavirus infection.19, 20, 21, 22, 23 Another question assessed the awareness concerning the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen when there is an infection.24\n,\n25 Other questions in the treatment section were about whether the use of some drugs (glucocorticoids and autoimmune disease medications) increase the susceptibility to contract coronavirus infection.26\n,\n27 Participants' awareness of how to prevent the transmission and the spread of the virus was assessed in depth as well, such as if washing hands with soap and water for 20 s would be enough to clean the hands, also the least distance that should be kept while counseling patients (2 m/6 feet).19\n,\n28\n,\n29 Two questions were about exercise, the first one asked if exercise causes antibodies and white blood cells to circulate more rapidly in the body, therefore detecting and combating infections at an early stage, and the second question asked if the brief rise in body temperature during and after exercise prevents bacterial growth, thus increases the body's ability to fight the infection.17\n,\n30 The rest of the questions were about the immune system and ways to boost it, to combat the viral infection.17\n,\n19\n,\n31\n,\n32 For example, participants were asked if protein-calorie malnutrition increases the opportunistic infection33\n,\n34; and the role of garlic, mushrooms, vitamin C and D was also questioned. Not smoking and the importance of decreasing stress to boost immunity was also questioned.35, 36, 37 And finally, the effect of sunlight in activating the T-helper cells in order to boost the immunity was questioned.38 Participants were asked to provide their email to receive the answers for the awareness questions once the study was completed if they wished to receive this information. Potential participants were also given the choice to view the correct answers via a Facebook page designed for this study. All items in this section required a True/False/Not sure response.",

It was important to raise awareness about this fact (as participants received the correct answers upon completion of the study), because anecdotal comments from pharmacists indicated that some did not allow customers to come anywhere near them which negatively affected the counseling process. The majority (76%) of them were not aware of the highest risk population group in terms of contracting the coronavirus infection and they believed that children under the age of 9 were at highest risk along with and to the same extent as the elderly (>65) and immune-compromised patients, while 5% were not sure. It was interesting to note that generally significantly more pharmacists answered the awareness items on the survey correctly than pharmacy student. This may indicate the experience boosts clinical awareness and reasoning skills of pharmacists. Study results indicated that not only being a practicing pharmacist versus a pharmacy student was associated with better awareness, but that older age, being a public university alumnus versus a private university alumnus, attending more educational workshops on a yearly basis were also significantly associated with a better level of awareness. None of these are of course surprising except of course the difference in graduating from a different type of educational institution (public vs. private). It is noteworthy to recognize that this finding could be due to the fact that about half of the graduates from the private educational institutions in Jordan are international students, who travel back to their countries once they graduate; international students who remain in Jordan are not able to practice as pharmacists.",

This model initiated in the nineties in the United States of America (USA) with pharmacy chains being initial adopters, though now it is a well espoused model acrossthe USA.52 In Jordan, drive-through pharmacy services have recently been introduced representing a new trend in community pharmacy services with positive customer awareness and perceptions towards the service.53 Although of course the model limits the \u2018sit-down\u2019 counseling deemed as a higher order role of pharmacists, in Jordan, this service appeared well received particularly in a certain subset of customers, but concerns regarding proper counseling represented the main disadvantage of the service.43About 50% of the participants in this study believed that they should be allowed to sell medications for coronavirus management via the drive-through service available in some chain pharmacies in Jordan. Although benefits may be found in this approach of dispensing in the COVID-19 era, suboptimal counseling raises a concern. This discussion falls unto policymakers to make a clear announcement about whether to allow, encourage, or prohibit pharmacists from dispensing coronavirus patients' medications via the drive-through service. In public health emergencies, clinical pharmacists enact their professional expertise by analyzing the current situation rationally and working in a professionally cohesive and efficient manner to provide innovative pharmacy services around medication safety and rational use of medicines.43 We acknowledge that the scope of community pharmacy practice varies considerably across countries, hence, it is important to examine ways in which the profession can assist with the public health response to COVID-19. This can be donenot only by maintaining the continuity of healthcare services but by achieving optimal use of possible services.54\n",

A majority of the participants were from Amman, the capital, where the availability of CPD workshops can be higher than in other areas of the country. We did not ask the pharmacy students about their study year, which could have played a role in the results obtained; fourth and fifth year students for example are expected to have a wider awareness in the clinical field as compared to students in the earlier years of their study. The survey itself, is also of course not validated, although, items were put together in real-time, based on the literature and reviewed by a team of clinical pharmacy experts.",

The majority believed they have a major role in the management of epidemics/pandemics through their pharmacies. Certain gaps in the awareness about COVID-19 were identified highlighting areas of improvement, and generally, pharmacists showed significantly higher awareness score than students, which is, in a way, a satisfactory and expected finding. Higher age of participants, graduating from a public university versus a private university, and attending educational workshops on a yearly basis also significantly affected the awareness level.",
