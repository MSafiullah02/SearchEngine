Some scholars proposed establishing traffic control, using a triage process for patients, and creating checkpoints for hand washing.5 Successful control of the SARS epidemic relied on the integration of several measures, including triage of patients with fever of unknown etiology, mandatory body temperature surveillance, and installation of a fever screening outpatient department.6 Infection control measures including hand washing, wearing masks, gloves, wearing protective clothing and shoe covers, and so on, were also recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States during the SARS outbreak.7 These infection control measures were further refined and improved during the Ebola outbreak.8 Similarly, the Ministry of Health of China formulated a prescreening and triage system after the SARS epidemic.9\n",

Epidemiological survey results were showing that the major source of viral spread was COVID-19 patients. The early COVID-19 cases in China were all related to the Huanan (Southern China) Seafood Wholesale Market, and the cumulative confirmed cases in Hubei Province and Wuhan accounted for 74.3% and 43.2% of the whole country, respectively, which were the key areas for epidemic prevention and control.10 To select patients in urgent need of treatment and to effectively make use of the limited medical resources, medical staff in Wuhan used prescreening and triage strategies based on clinical manifestations.11 However, COVID-19 patients in Shaanxi Province mainly migrated from other provinces, where a local epidemic had not yet appeared. Therefore, in nonepidemic areas, the prescreening and triage process should focus on screening infectious sources to prevent the spread of infection in the local area. Therefore, we take the migration and contact history of patients as the key point of screening. According to the environment of our hospital, we set up the triage system shown in Figure 1, and we formulated the prescreening and triage process shown in Figure 2.",
