There were 421 responses. Overall, 28% obtained positions that were not entirely related to the management of infectious diseases and 42% felt that their compensation was inadequate. Among 2011 graduates, 35% had positions that were not entirely related to infectious diseases, and job satisfaction was much less in that group.",

            "text": "The creation of a new physician specialty, the \u201chospitalist,\u201d and the increasing difficulty to obtain permanent visas for non-US physicians have, in our opinion, significantly swayed international medical graduates away from the field of infectious diseases. The increasing number of hospitalists in US hospitals has created new opportunities for internal medicine graduates. In 2010, it was estimated that there were >30 000 hospitalists in the United States; many graduates are choosing this field, attracted by both the financial and lifestyle benefits afforded to those choosing this subspeciality [4]. From a recent survey of 40 000 new physicians conducted in September 2011, the median starting salary for hospitalists was $165 000 compared with $158 000 for infectious diseases physicians [5]. Hospitalists are not required to have additional years of subspecialty training and often are paid higher wages than a board-certified infectious diseases physician, work in shifts with extended periods of time off, and have no outpatient overhead or responsibilities. This is appealing to many young physicians who are frequently burdened with large debt and growing families, especially at a time of uncertainty over the effects of healthcare payment reform. The effect of the rapid growth of the hospitalist on candidates applying for the infectious diseases match has not been formally evaluated. However, there is a temporal association between the increase in this field and the reduction in the number of international graduates applying to adult infectious diseases programs. A recent survey of internal medicine resident graduates from 2009 to 2011 demonstrated that international graduates had a decreased interest in all subspecialty medicine and an increased interest in hospitalist medicine as a career plan from the first to the third postgraduate year [6].",

            "text": "An additional factor that may affect international medical residents' decision to pursue a career in infectious diseases is the US visa (J-1 or H-1) requirement when deciding postresidency career plans. In recent years, federal regulations have been tightened for non-US physicians to obtain the H-1 visa that leads to permanent residency in the United States. Fellowship training programs are increasingly reluctant to incur the costs associated with visa sponsorship, thus limiting residents' opportunities for fellowship positions. Trainees with H-1 visas have a 6-year window to complete their training and apply for permanent residency (green card) status; completing 5 years of training (3 years of residency and 2 years of fellowship) restricts the time available to apply for a green card. For internal medicine residents with a J-1 visa, because few J-1\u2013sponsored jobs exist for subspecialists, most enter the field of general internal medicine. Moreover, the recent change in dates of the match (from June of second year of residency to December of third year) leaves unmatched candidates little time to secure a J-1\u2013sponsored job. Hence, visa-related issues are likely a large factor in the decreasing number of fellowship applicants among international graduates. This trend has disproportionately affected the infectious diseases subspecialty\u2014the percentage of decline, from 2010 to 2014, among the international students applying for an infectious diseases match was 38%, compared with an overall decline of only 3.7% to all internal medicine fellowships. The exact reasons for this disproportionate decrease are unclear.",

            "text": "In addition to issues such as reimbursement, lifestyle, and visa, there is also a concern of job availability for the graduating infectious diseases fellows. This issue was previously addressed in 2 editorials from another era [7, 8]. In a 1987 editorial, saturation of the job market was felt to be \u201cimminent\u201d and would likely \u201clast much longer in the field of infectious diseases than in subspecialties that are older\u201d [8]. Hence, the trainees may feel that job opportunities in infectious diseases are decreasing, particularly with improved control and relatively straightforward management of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS. In 2 more recent articles, the expanding roles of infectious diseases physicians were summarized [9, 10]. Infection control/hospital epidemiology, antibiotic stewardship, treatment of sepsis, and outpatient antibiotic therapy have been cited as additional areas of responsibilities that help avoid saturating the infectious diseases job market. Certainly, the expanding population of HIV-infected individuals due to the advances in anti-HIV therapy has contributed to the steady growth of infectious diseases jobs over the last 2 decades. Importantly, with the newer anti\u2013hepatitis C drugs and the increase in the immunosuppressed population, the role of infectious diseases physicians in the prevention/management of infections will likely increase while we witness decreasing national trends in hospitalization rates and length of stay as well as decrease in reimbursement for consultants.",

IDSA is currently funding a formal study to better understand those factors that influence Internal Medicine residents' subspecialty career choices in general, and specifically for Infectious Diseases.

As the main target for potential fellowship applicants will increasingly be US graduates, the process of promoting our field needs to begin in preclinical years of medical school. This will be particularly important as the number of US medical school graduates is expected to grow. It is time to review, update, and expand the syllabi for infectious diseases in medical school curricula. Given the issue of the urgency of global antimicrobial resistance, the medical school deans may be convinced to give increased time for infectious diseases. Increasing knowledge and experience among medical students in areas of global health, HIV infection, antibiotic stewardship, and diagnostic microbiology would hopefully increase the pool of future applicants. Opportunities for students to spend time at medical schools in developing countries is likely to further their interest in the field of infectious diseases and global health. Mentorship for student research among medical school faculty through programs such as the Medical Scholars Program (sponsored by the IDSA) is critical.\n",

The infectious diseases faculty (practitioners) need to work toward a mandatory rotation in infectious diseases for all internal medicine residents. Infectious diseases faculty must become increasingly involved in personal and professional mentoring of all residents, in fostering research, and in the development of the internal medicine residency curriculum for infection control, antibiotic stewardship, and HIV continuity care. Patient safety and quality improvement are areas that provide rich opportunities for clinical research, and infectious diseases clinicians can play a major leadership role attracting residents to participate in research in such areas. The infectious diseases faculty need to identify potential candidates during the formative period of residency and nurture such individuals. Exposing junior residents to ambulatory infectious diseases and HIV clinics may serve well in many institutions. The decreased presence of infectious diseases faculty within many internal medicine residency programs needs remediation. Encouraging residents to present their research in local or state infectious diseases society meetings is an inexpensive method to promote lifelong interest in infectious diseases. Although there are limited resources to train medical residents abroad, the use of teleconferences with partner institutions overseas can be used to create interest, particularly in tropical medicine.",
