This study aims to quantify pneumonia lesions by computed tomography (CT) in the early days to predict progression to severe illness in a cohort of COVID-19 patients. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included confirmed COVID-19 patients. Three quantitative CT features of pneumonia lesions were automatically calculated using artificial intelligence algorithms, representing the percentages of ground-glass opacity volume (PGV), semi-consolidation volume (PSV), and consolidation volume (PCV) in both lungs. CT features, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE-II) score, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and d-dimer, on day 0 (hospital admission) and day 4, were collected to predict the occurrence of severe illness within a 28-day follow-up using both logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models. Results: We included 134 patients, of whom 19 (14.2%) developed any severe illness. CT features on day 0 and day 4, as well as their changes from day 0 to day 4, showed predictive capability. Changes in CT features from day 0 to day 4 performed the best in the prediction (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87~0.99; C-index=0.88, 95% CI 0.81~0.95). The hazard ratios of PGV and PCV were 1.39 (95% CI 1.05~1.84, P=0.023) and 1.67 (95% CI 1.17~2.38, P=0.005), respectively. CT features, adjusted for age and gender, on day 4 and in terms of changes from day 0 to day 4 outperformed APACHE-II, NLR, and d-dimer. Conclusions: CT quantification of pneumonia lesions can early and non-invasively predict the progression to severe illness, providing a promising prognostic indicator for clinical management of COVID-19.",

            "text": "In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province in China [1] . The virus quickly spread throughout China and to many other countries/regions, with globally 1,353,361 confirmed cases and 79,235 deaths reported by WHO as of April 8, 2020 [2] . Most patients of COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but a few could develop severe pneumonia, pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome or even die. In one epidemical report of COVID-19 by China Center for Disease Control (CDC), among 44,672 confirmed cases, severe patients accounted for 13.8%, and critically ill patients accounted for 4.7% [1] . The crude case fatality ratio for critically ill patients was 49.0%, and the average risk of death within a 10-day follow-up was 0.325 for these patients [1] . Another recent study revealed that the 28-day case fatality ratio among critically ill patients was as high as 61.5% [3] . It is important to unravel the risk factors associated with severe illness and identify patients at an early stage who are most likely to have poor outcomes to focus on prevention and treatment efforts [4] .",

These clinical biomarkers have been employed to predict prognosis in patients with ARDS [7, 9, 10] or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [11] . However, they are not accurate enough to assess the infection and mostly involve invasive examinations, which may elevate the risk of virus exposure and healthcare-associated infection. Furthermore, the scoring systems like APACHE-II are subjective and time-consuming, which could delay the clinical management against the COVID-19 outbreak. A high level of d-dimer was recently reported as a risk factor for poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients [12, 13] . However, the predicting performance of d-dimer has not been studied.",

CT assessment has been added as an important criterion for COVID-19 diagnosis and subtyping to the 6 th version of national diagnosis and treatment protocols of COVID-19 in China [17] . However, currently, CT of COVID-19 is often manually evaluated by radiologists, which is very subjective with large inter-and intra-observer variability thus unable to accurately and quantitatively evaluate the disease severity and is also time-consuming and inefficient. It is now recognized that artificial intelligence (AI) holds promise for deriving quantitative CT features and precisely predicting the risk of lung cancer and poor outcomes of ARDS [10, [18] [19] [20] . However, to the best of our knowledge, associations between AI-derived CT features quantifying pneumonia lesions and the risk of severe illness in patients with the emerging COVID- 19 have not yet been reported. If AI-derived features from CT at an early stage of COVID-19 can be used to predict progression to severe illness, they can be particularly beneficial because CT is noninvasive and easily accessible and AI is time-efficient.",

External validation with 383 axial CT images from 206 patients showed a Dice coefficient of 82.08% for COVID-19 pneumonia lesion segmentation (unpublished data from our other study with a focus on the development and validation of the AI system).

In this study, we found that CT features on day 4 performed much better than that on day 0, which is consistent with our previous report that some COVID patients present dramatic changes on CT imaging on day 4 compared to day 0 [15] .
