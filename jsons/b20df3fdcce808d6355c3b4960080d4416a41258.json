Two end-channel approaches for integration of gold wire electrodes in CE-ED microchip were used. A 250 mm diameter gold wire was manually aligned at the outlet of the separation channel. A new approach based on a guide channel for integration of 100 and 50 mm diameter gold wire has been also developed in order to reduce the background current and the baseline noise level. Modification of gold wire electrodes has been also tested to improve the detector performance. Application of MCE-ED for ssDNA detection has been studied and demonstrated for the first time using the electroactive dye MB. Electrostatic interaction between cationic MB and anionic ssDNA was used for monitoring the DNA on microchips. Thus, reproducible calibration curves for ssDNA were obtained. This study advances the feasibility of direct DNA analysis using CEmicrochip with ED.",

The end-channel configuration is the most commonly used amperometric detection mode, where the working electrode is located close (10-50 mm) to the outlet of the separation channel. Different electrode materials and integration/alignment modes have been used for end-channel detectors. The working electrode can be permanently integrated on-chip by means of thin-films made of platinum [23, 24] , gold [25] [26] [27] , copper [26] , or carbon [28] placed close to the channel exit. Other approach is based on an off-chip alignment of replaceable disk [10, [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] or thick-film [33] [34] [35] working electrodes. In this case, the working electrode could be replaced when surface fouling happened. Thus, planar thick-film carbon electrodes have been mounted perpendicular to the flow direction [4, [33] [34] [35] . Several designs based on a guide tube have been developed in order to align platinum microdisk [31] and carbon fiber [31, 32] electrodes. XYZ micromanipulators have also been employed for aligning metal wire electrodes [8, 29] . Platinum, gold, and copper microwires have been aligned across the separation channel using a channel patterned in PDMS [30] .",

Thus, different labels including redox-active molecules [36] [37] [38] [39] , metal nanoparticles [36] , or enzymes [36, 40] have been employed. The simplest mode is based on the use of redox-active molecules which contain a planar aromatic structure that could insert itself between two adjacent base pair of DNA (intercalator) or interact with DNA grooves. In this way, previous labeling of reagents is not necessary and the marker becomes universal. Several metal complexes [36] , anticancer agents such as daunomycin [36, 37] , organic dyes such as methylene blue (MB) [36] [37] [38] 41] , and other molecules such as anthraquinone derivatives [36, 42] have been used as intercalators and groove binders.",

Obtaining an adequate signal for DNA strands is a key step for developing an appropriate methodology. Amperometric detection has been also used in combination with MCE for DNA analysis. Redox indicators of DNA have been widely employed in biosensors for monitoring DNA hybridization [43, 44] ; however, bibliography related to the employ of indicators with the aim of detecting DNA in CE microchips is scarce when ED is concerned. A laborious covalent labeling of allele-specific primers with ferrocene has been performed for a PCR-based SNP typing assay employing CGE on microchip [27] . This molecule is employed also as label for chain terminators in the detection of SNPs by CGE microchip in a single-base extension reaction [28] . Apart from this covalent labeling, an indirect ED through the complex Fe(phen) 3 21 that acted as intercalation agent has been developed to separate and detect DNA restriction fragments and PCR products [23, 27] on CGE microchips. The constant background current from free Fe(phen) 3 21 in the separation buffer decreases when DNA-Fe(phen) 3 21 complexes migrate through the detection region, so the passage of DNA is indicated by transient dips in the background current. This is the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that specific interaction of an intercalator with ssDNA is electrochemically detected on a CE microchip.",

A single strand of probe DNA will not allow efficient LET to occur and the free surface is blocked to avoid direct transfer. From the several anthraquinone derivatives, three among them: the monosulfonic (AQMS) and two different disulfonic (2,6-AQDS and 1,5-AQDS) were evaluated. The cyclic voltammogram recorded in a 1 mM AQMS solution is shown in Fig. 2A . A cathodic process that appears at 20.662 V corre- sponds to the reduction of the keto groups of the antraquinone to the corresponding alcohol. The reoxidation to the keto form occurs at 20.137 V. When the voltammogram is recorded in a 2,6-AQDS solution, the redox process becomes poorly defined and the closeness of the background current makes difficult the measurement of cathodic currents. When the two sulfonic groups are in a nearer position (1,5) the process becomes more irreversible. The amperometric detection of antraquinones will require an optimal detection potential over -0.5 V, where solutions must be deareated. Since moreover, this potential is near the background current, it will increase the baseline noise level. Therefore, anthraquinone species were discarded for DNA application on MCE. In addition, these molecules possess sulphonic groups and therefore they are negatively charged at the working pH and could suffer repulsion from polyanionic DNA.",

The cyclic voltammogram shows a cathodic process at 20.215 V (conversion of MB to leucomethylene blue (LB), a two electron process [38] ). The corresponding anodic process appears at 20.127 V which means a difference of 0.088V (i p an /i p cat = 1.37). In both cases, the peak current varies linerarly (r equal to 0.9996 and 0.998 for the anodic and cathodic processes, respectively) with the square root of the scan rate, indicating that the processes are diffusion controlled. The precision of the signals is very adequate since where ten measurements are successively recorded, an RSD of 3.0 and 3.1% is obtained for the oxidation and reduction processes, respectively. The process was also checked at carbon electrodes (screen-printed electrodes). Although it becomes more reversible (DE = 0.056V, i p an /i p cat = 1.03) the intensity of successive signals is increasing with the number of the scans. The third signal is 3.1 6 0.3 times higher when compared with the first one, which implies the necessity of performing an electrode pretreatment for obtaining reproducible signals. Activation procedures are usual when solid electrodes are used but when they are part of a microchip the whole procedure becomes more complicate and the performance of the detector can deteriorate. Moreover, the intensities of the peak current are always lower than those obtained with gold wires for the same MB concentration (10 mM). Therefore, the process that MB presents at gold electrodes seems to be more adequate for following the signal of DNA. MB has been shown to bind specifically to the guanine bases of ssDNA [48, 49] . Furthermore, as MB is positively charged, its interaction with DNA is easier and more rapid than for anionic intercalators.",

Since MB is a cation at the working pH it should appear before the EOF. This means that the migration time is going to be lower than this of other neutral or anionic intercalators. Under the conditions stated above, the migration time for MB is around 40 s. The intensity at the maximum of the peak is 25nA. Although the front of the peak is marked, an excessive band broadening was observed. Indeed, the peak did not turn back to the baseline until 100 s approximately. Moreover, the baseline current with the 250 mm diameter gold wire was relatively high (224 nA) as well as the noise level (0.2 nA), which could pose a problem when sensitivity is required. This is probably due to the area of the gold wire electrode. Taking into account the design of the chip detection, only the gold area in front of the microchannel outlet is responsible for analytical signals. However, as the working electrode is a wire, the rest of the area of the electrode could contribute to the capacitive current that is proportional to the electrode area, increasing band broadening, and noise level.",

Considering the geometry of the microchannel, 20 mm depth with 32 mm width at the bottom and 60 mm width at the top, the 250 mm diameter gold wire covers the entire outlet. MB reaches the electrode frontally and gives a sharp peak but then it continues along the electrode wall meanwhile it dilutes, producing band broadening. Thus, 100 and 50 mm diameter gold wire were checked as working electrode in combination with Topas microchips. Table 1 shows a comparative of parameters such as peak current (i p ), half-peak width (w 1/2 ), background current, noise level, and S/N for the different gold wire electrodes. Although the peak current of MB with 100 and 50 mm diameter gold wire was lower than this for 250 mm diameter, the noise level was also lower, approximately ten times lower. Thus, S/N was approximately two-fold higher in those for the same MB concentration. This increase was probably due to the smaller area of the electrode and the lowest effect of the high voltage.",

This is clearly seen in Figs. 4b and c, where electropherograms recorded employing a 100 mm diameter gold wire located at different distances from the channel exit are presented. When the electrode was too far from the channel outlet (more than 100 mm, Fig. 4b ) a decrease in the intensity was observed due to analyte dilution in the reservoir. It can also be noted that the peak is not as sharp in the front as before. Meanwhile, if the electrode was closer to the separation channel (below 50 mm, Fig. 4c ) an increase in the peak current is observed. In this case, a slight initial baseline slope, due to the influence of high voltage, reflected the proximity of the electrodes to the outlet. A very small channel-to-electrode distance could result in relatively intense interference of the separation voltage on the detection, decreasing the sensitivity too. Therefore, selecting an appropriate distance can ensure effective hydrodynamic transport of the analyte zone toward the electrode surface and minimize the influence of the high electric field. Modification of the 100 mm diameter gold wire with 1hexanethiol was also tested. However, in this case, better S/N was not obtained. Thus, unmodified 100 mm diameter gold wire electrode was employed in the remainder of the work due to its better S/N as well as the easier and more accurate alignment when compared to that of 50 mm diameter.",

The reaction was performed adding DNA to dye as previously reported [61] . This mixing order was determined to affect the distribu-tion of dye molecules on DNA fragments. Moreover, in this way, a signal of MB before interaction with ssDNA can be obtained. Figure 5 shows the electropherograms recorded for the sample mixture of 100 mM MB and 10 ng/mL ssDNA as well as single 100 mM MB on a Topas-microchip using a separation voltage of 12000 V (370 V/cm), an injection voltage of 11500 V applied for 5 s and TBE as running buffer. In Fig. 5A , the signal corresponding to a MB solution is shown. When ssDNA is added, two peaks were initially recorded (Fig. 5B) , the first one, at 40 s, corresponding to free MB and the second one, at 80 s, was due to ssDNA-MB complex. DNA is not electroactive at this potential and therefore this signal must be due to MB associated to DNA. Moreover, DNA, as a polyanion, moves against the direction of EOF. The mobility of DNA would be smaller than that of free MB and EOF. Although charges can be partially compensated by MB, it appears separately at higher times accordingly to its charge/mass ratio. The separation efficiency, expressed as the theoretical plate number (N), was 8700 6 500 and 29 000 6 2000/m for free MB and ssDNA-MB complex, respectively. An excellent resolution (R s = 4) was also shown. Nevertheless, the second peak was not very reproducible with time and sometimes it could even disappear.",

Thus, SDS was added to the initial running buffer TBE (50 mM Tris-boric acid pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA) in a 1 mM concentration, that is below the critical micellar concentration. When this buffer was employed, a decrease on the analytical signal of MB was observed. Additionally, nonsignal of ssDNA-MB was observed. Since SDS is an anionic surfactant, it can interact with cationic MB and probably impede the interaction with ssDNA. Actually, MB has been employed for the spectrophotometric determination of surfactants since they form an ionic pair that can be extracted in chloroform [62] . On the other hand, a decrease in the ionic strength of the running buffer was also tested in order to improve the interaction ssDNA-MB. Since ssDNA possesses phosphate groups that render it anionic, ions from the solution may interact with them and impede its interaction with MB. Moreover, in the modes of binding of MB the influence of the ionic strength is of relevance [63] . Thus, TB buffer (50 mM Tris-boric acid pH 7.0) without EDTA was employed. EDTA could interact with MB and interfere its interaction with ssDNA. In this case, a slight increase on the free MB and ssDNA-MB peak current is seen. However, the ssDNA-MB signal disappears with time.",

Thus, a calibration plot based on the decrease of MB peak with the ssDNA was found to be linear in the range 5-40 ng/mL with a sensitivity of 31 pA mL/ng (r = 0.998, n = 5). The LOD estimated was 4 ng/mL, corresponding to a mass of 0.4 pg in a 100 pL sample injection.
