Several reports show a high incidence of infection in community-acquired pneumonia, ranging from 6% to 25%, and a remarkable role in pneumonia outbreaks in closed communities like military garrisons, schools and families [8,12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Further, C. pneumoniae is involved in upper respiratory tract infections (pharyngitis, sinusitis, otitis), acute bronchitis and exacerbations of chronic bronchitis [5,6]. Recently, Hahn et al [10] reported a possible etiopathogenetic role of this pathogen in adult onset of asthma and in asthma exacerbation.",

Possible chronic C. pneumoniae infection in chronic bronchitis was suggested by Blasi et al [6], who found a significantly higher frequency of IgG anti-Chlamydia pneumoniae antibody, exceeding 63%, in patients with exacerbations of COPD compared to controls. This remarkably high prevalence could be due to either chronic infection by C. pneumoniae, as suggested by the increase of specific IgG prevalence and geometric mean titer with age, or a higher rate of acute infection in such patients. Von Hertzen et al [34] found no differences in serum IgG antibodies between patients and controls, but the difference in serum IgA prevalence was significant. Moreover, local sputum IgA antibodies against C. pneumoniae, absent in the majority of pneumonia patients, were a common finding in the sputa of chronic bronchitis patients, along with local antibodies against Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis. C. pneumoniae might therefore be added to these bacteria, which have invariably been associated with the pathogenesis of chronic bronchitis.",

Blasi et al have recently published preliminary results on C. pneumoniae seroprevalence in HIV-1-infected intravenous drug users and HIV-1 vertically infected children [17]. The seroprevalence of C. pneumoniae in the HIV-1-infected intravenous drug users (IDUs) was significantly higher than in both HIV-1-negative IDUs and immunocompetent subjects matched for age and sex. Recent reports suggest a possible role of C. pneumoniae as an etiologic agent of pneumonia in HIV-1-positive subjects [18, 19, 20, 21]. In a retrospective serologic study, Blasi et al [21] observed an outbreak of C. pneumoniae infection in an ex-injection drug user community, where almost 25% of the residents were HIV-1 positive. The epidemic occurred in a small group of 26 subjects living and working in the same place. Their rate of HIV-1 positivity was remarkably high (50%). A higher C. pneumoniae infection rate in HIV-1-positive subjects was observed, with more than 76% of HIV-1-positive patients compared to only 38% of HIV-negative subjects suffering from acute C. pneumoniae infections. Moreover, most pneumonias occurred in HIV-1-positive patients. All lung infections were mild to moderate in severity, with a spontaneous recovery in one HIV-1-negative subject.",

In children, the role of viral infection in acute exacerbations of asthma has long been recognized, although its role in the pathogenesis of asthma is still controversial [42]. Less is known about the association between infections and asthma in adults. Commonly, influenza and the common cold precede asthma attacks, suggesting an etiopathogenic link between viral infection and acute exacerbation.
