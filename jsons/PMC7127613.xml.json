In this study, we also studied whether or not exposure of neutrophils to LTB4 in vitro induced virucidal effects against respiratory viruses: human coronavirus, human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human influenza B virus. Finally, in a preliminary experiment involving healthy subjects, we examined effects of LTB4 on human rhinovirus-16 (HRV-16) induced virus replication, seroconversion, and symptoms.",

This is in contrast to conditions characterized by increased neutrophil activity, e.g., viral infections, where IL-8 is thought to be central in mediating a neutrophil response.18 Conversely, the present observations are in keeping with the notion that neutrophil activity mediated by LTB4 may not be a disease-like mechanism, but rather a feature of the innate immune defense system.",

Together, these observations suggest an association between LTB4 and eosinophil activity. In contrast, in the present study, while LTB4 increased the generation of MPO, lavage fluid levels of ECP were unaffected, indicating that nasal granulocyte activity mediated by LTB4 in the human nasal airway does not involve eosinophils. We cannot exclude the possibility that LTB4 may increase eosinophil activity if elevated numbers of eosinophils would be present at the time of challenge, e.g., as in on-going allergic rhinitis or asthma (LTB4 has been administered to bronchial airways of patients with mild asthma, but without focus on airway eosinophil activity14). However, so far, available human in vivo observations with LTB4 argue against a role for LTB4 as a pro-eosinophil factor. For example, a LTB4 receptor antagonist had no effects on allergen-induced eosinophilia in asthma.28\n",

The process comprises extravasation and luminal entry of bulk plasma, including high molecular weight proteins such as \u03b12-macroglobulin (725 kDa).

In contrast, Bende et al.30 in a study on anesthetized rabbits, reported increased vascular permeability following nasal challenge with LTB4. We have no specific explanation for the discrepant findings, but species differences may be one reason.29 The present observation is in agreement with observations in man by Martin et al.12: unaffected levels of albumin as well as total protein in BAL-fluids were observed in healthy subjects following segmental LTB4 challenge.

The finding suggests that a heightened neutrophil activity is beneficial in the context of viral exposure of the upper respiratory tract. This is indirectly supported by the present in vitro observations that LTB4-activated neutrophils produce factors active against respiratory viruses. Moreover, previous studies have implicated neutrophils as an important player in the response to such infections,32, 33, 34, 35 and Gaudreault et al. demonstrated that i.v. LTB4 upregulated antimicrobial peptides and reduced viral load in influenza infected mice in vivo.36 In line with this, we employed HRV-16 inoculations and explored the effect of repeated nasal administration of LTB4 on rhinovirus infections in a preliminary study. The dose investigated (2.0 \u03bcg) was chosen based on the present dose-response experiments involving LTB4, whereby increased neutrophil activity was induced without producing exudative inflammation or symptoms. We elected to use a low-dose (10 TCID50) virus challenge as this has been shown to be effective in inducing colds in COPD-subjects.37 Furthermore, we believe this to be a better model of natural transmission of virus infections (where inoculation occurs with very small amount of virus followed by replication up to high titres with resultant symptom induction) than would be the case with high-dose challenge model where inoculation with doses as high as 10,000 TCID50 is performed.22\n",

Furthermore, this group presented mild, yet statistically significant, nasal symptoms of common cold and a minor increase in nasal mucosal output of IL-8. However, unlike high-dose challenge where \u223c90% of subjects become infected,22 only 12/20 control subjects seroconverted and 12/20 had evidence of virus replication with 6/20 having high virus titres. These lower than expected numbers of infected subjects likely hampered our ability to detect statistically significant effects on viral outcomes. Nonetheless, several of the present observations suggested that LTB4 might have affected virus replication. For example, the degree of viral shedding was reduced by nearly 50% in the LTB4-group compared with the control group. Also, of the top five virus-shedding individuals, four were found in the control group. However, likely in part reflecting an inferior power of the parallel group design, as well as the issue with numbers of infected subjects, the changes failed to reach statistical significance. While these data, together with our observations in vitro, were promising, symptoms and incidence of seroconversion were not affected by LTB4. Accordingly, LTB4 did not provide convincing evidence of a preventive treatment for common cold infections caused by HRV-16. Further studies with greater numbers of infected subjects, and properly powered using data from the present study, are warranted to explore whether or not nasal administration of LTB4 can be useful to prevent or treat upper respiratory tract infections. Also, it would be of interest to explore effects of LTB4 in bacterial infections, where neutrophil phagocytosis is of key importance to clear infections.37\n",
