Air pollution is a complex mixture of various gases, particulates, hydrocarbons, and transition metals. Of all these pollutants, the association between air pollution and adverse health conditions is strongest and most consistent for respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) with an aerodynamic diameter <10 \u03bcm (PM10). The health risk from particulate pollution is high for some susceptible groups such as the children and the elderly persons, and those with diseases of the heart and lungs (Ulrich et al. 2002).",

Thus, the presence of a particular symptom or a group of symptoms can confirm the presence of an underlying disease in the upper or lower airways. Respiratory symptoms are classified into two broad groups: (1) upper respiratory symptoms (URS), which include running and stuffy nose, sinusitis, sore throat, cold head, fever, and burning or red eyes, and (2) lower respiratory symptoms (LRS), which include wheezing, wet cough, dry cough, phlegm, shortness of breath, and chest discomfort or pain. Most of the respiratory diseases underlying these symptoms are caused by bacterial, fungal, or viral infections or by structural or functional damage to the respiratory system. Very often the symptoms of a respiratory disease are aggravated following exposure to air pollutant.",

Air pollution is viewed as a serious problem in Delhi. The Indian capital has the dubious distinction of being one of the most polluted cities in the world. In 2005, Delhi had an annual average concentration of RSPM, i.e., PM10, of 163.4 \u03bcg/m3, which was 2.7-fold higher the Indian standards for residential areas (60 \u03bcg/m3). The major sources of the city\u2019s air pollution are road traffic (72%), industrial emissions (20%), and emissions from household activities (8%) (Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India 2007). Soil resuspension is also an important source of air pollution in the city (Balachandran et al. 2000). Accordingly, the study reported here was undertaken to examine the respiratory health of children in Delhi with the sponsorship of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Delhi.",

The questions mainly addressed respiratory symptoms, such as attacks of shortness of breath, wheezing, dry or wet cough, and chest tightness. The questions were generally formulated to elicit information covering the 12-month period preceding completion of the questionnaire. It also included extended items on asthma, asthma-like symptoms, and allergies. After consent had been obtained from the school principal, the respiratory health questionnaires were distributed among the school children. Completed questionnaire forms signed by the parent or guardian and countersigned by the class teacher were collected from the respective schools.",

Using multivariate logistic regression analysis after controlling for potential confounders, such as parental smoking and SES, we found that particulate pollution was positively associated with all six symptoms of LRS. The strongest association was for sleep disturbance due to breathing trouble and dry cough, followed by chest pain or discomfort, breathlessness on exertion, cough with sputum production, and wheeze. In essence, the prevalence of LRS increases with increasing concentrations of particulate pollution in the breathing air.\n\n",

Respiratory symptoms, both URS and LRS, were more prevalent during the winter followed by the summer and monsoon, which again corresponds with the concentration of PM, which was highest during the winter and lowest during the monsoon. The prevalence of RSC varied with seasons, again showing links to PM10 level as the level of PM10 was lowest during the monsoon and highest during the winter. Another important confounder was SES, with the lower the SES, the higher the prevalence of RSC. Poverty and lower social status are associated with a large family size, crowded living conditions, poorer access to medical care, higher smoking rates, nutritional deficits, and exposure to environmental pollutants, including urban air pollution and stressful living environments. These factors may contribute individually or perhaps interact among themselves to increase the susceptibility to respiratory diseases.

            "text": "Upper and lower respiratory symptoms, which were found in excess in children of Delhi, could be a fall-out of a greater interaction of the airways with allergens and pathogens and/or impairment in lung defense. A review of the literature on possible associations between air pollution and respiratory symptoms in children revealed that outdoor and indoor air pollution are positively associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children (Chauhan et al. 2005). Available evidence conclusively supports the association between outdoor air pollution, including PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and ozone, and increased upper and lower respiratory symptoms in children. Many of these symptoms are related to infections. Viral and bacterial infections can cause severe pathological abnormalities in both the upper and lower respiratory tract, with the extent of epithelial damage varying with the pathogen type. In particular, the lower airway epithelium between the bronchial and alveolar regions is more susceptible than the nasal, laryngeal and tracheal regions. It is possible that the penetration of pathogens into the epithelium could be facilitated by both epithelial shedding and reduced ciliary clearance, resulting in easier access of the pathogen to antigen-presenting cells and, consequently, leading to increased inflammation. Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are divided into two main groups; upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). The risk of severe ARIs is greatest in very young children and in the elderly. The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined URTIs as a combination of symptoms that include one or more of the following; cough with or without fever, blocked or running nose, sore throat and ear discharge (World Health Organization 1997). URTIs are usually viral in origin and include the common cold viruses, such as rhinoviruses and corona viruses. In contrast, LRTIs involve infections of the lung and are associated with symptoms like cough and dyspnea, bronchitis, and pneumonia, which usually present in serious forms. URTIs and LRTIs are not mutually exclusive; they frequently coexist during the same episode of respiratory infections. Bacteria and viruses cause infection in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and upper respiratory infections are often followed or accompanied by lower respiratory infections (Chauhan et al. 2005).",

Traffic-related air pollution and the risk of respiratory diseases in a cohort of 4,000 children were investigated in the Netherlands, and a positive association was observed between air pollution and URTIs. A study in the UK investigated the association between the number of general practitioner consultations for upper respiratory tract diseases, excluding allergic rhinitis, and outdoor air pollution. In children aged 0\u201314 years, a 3.5-fold increase in the number of such consultations was observed for an increase in SO2 levels of between 13 and 31 \u03bcg/m3 (Hajat et al. 1999, 2002). In another study in Taiwan, Hwang and Chan (2002) observed a 0.3\u20131.3% increase in the number of consultations with physicians with a 10% increase in the levels of NO2, SO2, and PM10. In a cross-sectional study in ten different areas of Switzerland in children aged 6\u201315 years, the risk of bronchitis between the most and least polluted areas was found to be significant with an OR of 2.17 for PM10 (Braun-Fahrlander et al. 1997). It is therefore quite possible that air pollution may modify symptoms in children who are already infected.",

Allergic rhinitis is one of the most common chronic diseases in children (Meltzer 2006). It can significantly impact a child\u2019s health, as it impairs the quality of life, and it can predispose to the development of co-morbidities, such as asthma (Meltzer 2006). The poor air quality of Delhi may account for these symptoms because a close relationship exists between outdoor air pollution and sinusitis (Wolf 2002).Exposure to fungal spores, such as those of Alternaria, could also elicit these symptoms (Delfino et al. 2002). A European study has shown that ambient particles (PM10) from combustion sources act as carriers of allergens (such as pollen) that could elicit allergic reactions in the airways following inhalation (Namork et al. 2006).",
