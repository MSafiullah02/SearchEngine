There has been much attention on healthcare providers as potential vectors of infection transmission and many infection-prevention strategies focus on this population. However, visitation to healthcare facilities by individuals other than healthcare personnel is common. Additionally, hospital visitors spend significant time with patients within the healthcare setting, often for longer periods than healthcare personnel [1]. Data on the topic remains sparse, though the Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) has recently issued guidance on the topic to assist healthcare institutions in addressing specific infection control questions pertinent to visitors [2]. The goal of this chapter is to review the potential role of visitors in the transmission of organisms in the healthcare setting and address specific situations in which infection prevention strategies may be appropriate in order to protect both patients and visitors.",

Since adults are more likely than children to be infectious with active tuberculosis, recognition of symptomatic disease in visitors accompanying suspected pediatric tuberculosis patients is crucial for infection prevention and control efforts. At a pediatric hospital, 24 pediatric patients developed active tuberculosis after exposure to a patient\u2019s mother with cavitary pulmonary disease [3]. Another report documented the development of latent tuberculosis infection in two hospital contacts of a visitor with active pulmonary disease on a pediatric ward [4]. Data suggests the parents or other primary caregivers are commonly the source of infection in pediatric patients with active tuberculosis [5]. Over a 6-year period, investigators at a children\u2019s hospital in Texas prospectively screened adults accompanying children with suspected tuberculosis to determine the frequency of undiagnosed disease in visitors. Of 105 adults screened, 16 (15%) had previously undetected pulmonary tuberculosis. These adults were associated with 14 (24%) of the 59 children admitted to the hospital with suspected tuberculosis during the study period. Consequently, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends screening the caregivers of pediatric tuberculosis patients for active disease [6]. Infection control practitioners should be aware of the strong association between pediatric tuberculosis and active disease in family members, recognize the risk of transmission from these visitors to other patients and staff, develop protocols for the screening of visitors when tuberculosis is suspected in a pediatric patient, and facilitate prompt evaluation and/or reporting to local public health departments when indicated.",

            "text": "Influenza and other respiratory viruses are likely the most common infections transmitted from visitors to patients due to their high seasonal prevalence, the potential for asymptomatic viral shedding, and the potential for indirect transmission from the environment. Following an outbreak of H3N2 influenza on a geriatric ward, genetic sequence analysis identified three distinct influenza clusters [7]. Two out of three were linked to healthcare personnel, while the third was assumed to be introduced by a visitor to the facility. Similarly, studies on the molecular and genetic diversity of nosocomial respiratory syncytial virus outbreaks suggest multiple strains tend to circulate during a hospital outbreak [8]. These data support the potential role visitors can play as a source of healthcare-associated transmission of respiratory viruses particularly when community prevalence is high. In one example during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, a hospital visitor was reported to be the source of an outbreak of six cases on a pediatric hematology-oncology ward [9]. Control measures included oseltamivir prophylaxis, isolation of cases, strict adherence to personal protective equipment, and visitor restriction. Visitor restriction has also been a key component in controlling respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza outbreaks especially among immunocompromised patient populations [10]. Because visitor restriction typically occurs simultaneously with other control interventions, the incremental effectiveness of this measure on reducing transmission is difficult to ascertain.",

Norovirus is capable of spreading rapidly through healthcare settings because of its low infectious dose and its ability to persist in the environment. As support for the effectiveness of visitor restrictions in decreasing the risk of norovirus transmission in healthcare settings, a prospective analysis of 49 nursing homes in the Netherlands found that restricting symptomatic visitors was the only control measure to significantly reduce the odds of norovirus acquisition in multivariate analysis [14]. In a large US hospital outbreak affecting over 500 patients and staff, all hospital visitations were temporarily restricted after transmission continued to occur following symptom screening of visitors [15]. The CDC\u2019s guidelines for norovirus prevention in healthcare settings include a category 1B recommendation to \u201cRestrict non-essential visitors from affected areas of the facility during outbreaks of norovirus gastroenteritis [16].\u201d If this is not practical or not deemed to be necessary, CDC recommends symptom screening and exclusion of visitor with symptoms consist with norovirus and ensuring visitor compliance with hand hygiene and contact precautions.",

Several reports documented visitors to healthcare settings acquiring SARS and becoming sources of transmission to patients, healthcare personnel, family members, and other community members [17, 18]. For instance, in Singapore, at least 21 SARS cases were reported resulting from transmission by hospital visitors to family and other community contacts [18]. Following recognition of the significance of visitors in SARS transmission dynamics, more stringent restrictions were placed on visitation. Visitors were tracked using logs and exposed visitors were quarantined. Visitors initially were allowed to visit SARS wards with full personal protective equipment, but due to continued transmission, all visitation at some affected hospitals was prohibited [18]. In Toronto, hospitals implemented a visitor and healthcare personnel screening with a questionnaire and temperature assessment prior to hospital entrance [19]. Visitors with concerning symptoms were referred to the emergency room. In Taiwan, infrared thermography was used to screen 72,327 outpatients and visitors over a 2-month period with identification of three probable SARS cases [20]. The lessons learned from SARS\nregarding the pivotal role visitors may play in the transmission of a communicable disease have informed public health guidance about more recent emerging infectious diseases such as Ebola and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) .",

Infection control practitioners play a vital role in engaging and educating healthcare personnel on the importance of screening visitors for communicable diseases and implementing and enforcing visitor restriction policies when necessary. The intensity of visitor symptom screening should be tailored based on individual hospital need and patient population. For instance, screening can be augmented for visitors to hospital locations with vulnerable patient populations such as neonates, the elderly, or immunocompromised particularly when community prevalence of respiratory viruses is high or when healthcare-associated transmission is recognized. Hospital administrators should support infection control programs to scale up enforcement of visitor-related infection control policies in such instances.",

There is limited data evaluating hand hygiene among visitors to healthcare settings, and most studies have been observational with significant heterogeneity in study design and setting. Generally, hand hygiene varied markedly between studies, usually lower than healthcare providers [25, 26], though a study in Japan showed high rates of adherence [27]. Increased hand hygiene rates have been identified among visitors to patients receiving care on contact precautions. Additionally, some interventional studies have shown that interventions can improve visitor adherence to hand hygiene practices [25, 26]. These include improving access to sinks and alcohol-based hand hygiene stations and the use of reminders to encourage visitors to perform hand hygiene before entering and after exiting patient rooms. The optimal strategy to encourage hand hygiene among visitors is unclear, but visual reminders through signs posted throughout the healthcare setting, verbal education, and reminders from healthcare personnel may improve hand hygiene rates among visitors.",

Institutional decisions regarding the use of barrier precautions among visitors should take into account the organism of concern, the endemicity of the organism to a specific healthcare setting, as well as the likelihood of transmission to the visitor and other patients within the facility [2]. Organisms of high virulence with limited therapeutic options, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), may warrant increased efforts to reduce spread including the use of barrier precautions among visitors. Gastrointestinal pathogens, including norovirus and Clostridium difficile, may infect and cause significant disease in normal hosts at a relatively high rate. Visitors to patients infected with these organisms may directly benefit from the use of barrier precautions in addition to standard precautions to prevent infecting themselves. Conversely, the benefit of barrier precautions use among visitors to patients with colonization or infection caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), both endemic in many healthcare settings, may be limited. Many household contacts of these patients may likely be colonized themselves [28, 29]. However, in settings of suspected high rates of transmission of these organism within a healthcare setting (outbreak or epidemic), the use of barrier precautions among visitors may be appropriate in order to maximize attempts to reduce transmission.",

These groups may include patients receiving immunosuppressing medications in the setting of organ transplantation or treatment of cancer or acquired or hereditary immunodeficiencies. The risk to hospital visitors with immunocompromising conditions likely varies by organism, mode of transmission, and other patient and environmental factors impacting infectivity. No professional societies or public health authorities have issued specific guidelines for this special population of hospital visitors. The American Society of Transplantation has published a guideline for safe living strategies among transplant recipients [78]. Although they do not specifically address hospital visitation, general principles outlined may be applicable to hospital visitation. Among immunocompromised visitors, hand hygiene is a particularly important infection prevention strategy. Generally, avoiding close contact with individuals with respiratory illness is recommended, and the use of a surgical mask should be considered for the immunocompromised visitor if contact cannot be avoided. The use of barrier precautions, particularly gown and glove use, may be useful among these visitors. It may be reasonable for immunocompromised individuals to avoid visiting patients with suspicion or proven infection with airborne pathogens (disseminated varicella, tuberculosis) or other virulent pathogens, particularly if they have not been fitted for an appropriate respirator [71].",

Outbreaks of communicable diseases in seemingly remote areas of the world have necessitated preparedness efforts for US healthcare facilities in the event of an imported case. The recent outbreak of Ebola in West Africa and the emergence of MERS-CoV in the Middle East are two such examples. The largest outbreak of MERS-CoV outside of the Middle East occurred in South Korea due to an imported case resulting in 186 secondary cases and 36 deaths. During this outbreak, hospital visitors were implicated in amplifying transmission in a similar fashion as was observed during the SARS outbreak [79\u201381]. Although imported cases of Ebola and MERS-CoV in the USA have been extremely rare, the high consequences of such events have led to greater recognition of the importance of hospital preparedness for emerging infectious diseases. To this end, CDC has issued explicit guidelines for managing visitors to healthcare facilities with hospitalized patients with MERS-CoV [82]. Recommendations include the following:Establish procedures for monitoring, managing, and training visitors.Screen visitors for respiratory illness prior to entering the hospital.Restrict visitors from entering the room of patients with MERS-CoV with consideration of exceptions for end-of-life situations when the visitor is otherwise essential for patient\u2019s well-being and care.Maintain a log of all visitors to patient rooms.Educate visitors on respiratory hygiene, cough etiquette, hand hygiene, personal protective equipment, and limiting contact with environmental surfaces in the room.Instruct visitor to limit their movement within the facility.Visitors to MERS-CoV patients should be scheduled and controlled to allow for the above.\n",

In the context of an infectious disease outbreak, restriction of visitation can conflict with the individual freedoms of patients and caregivers and the philosophy of patient-/family-centered care. Infection control practitioners must be cognizant of the powerful psychosocial impact denying visitation rights may have on patients and families. Such restrictions can be justified to protect public health on the basis of the epidemiological evidence demonstrating the role visitors can play in transmission of high-consequence infections such as SARS [85]. Accounting for the disease-specific consequences of infection and transmission can inform the public health justifications for visitor restrictions. For instance, in the case of MERS-CoV\n, the public health rationale for such stringent visitor precautions includes the lack of a safe and effective vaccine and chemoprophylaxis, the high rate of morbidity and mortality among infected patients, and incompletely defined modes of transmission [82]. Survey data from a Canadian hospital affected by the SARS outbreak demonstrated that the majority of healthcare personnel (90%), patients (80%), and family members (76%) supported visitor restrictions [86]. Communication to patients and families explaining visitation restriction policies should be clear and sensitive. Moreover, in some exceptional circumstances, the adverse psychosocial impact of visitor restriction and the patient\u2019s and family\u2019s emotional needs may necessitate flexibility in restricting visitation, particularly at the end of life. Understanding the short- and long-term psychosocial implications of visitor restriction, and the impact of transmission-based precautions on visitation and relationships between patients and visitors, in settings of both endemic and epidemic disease, warrants further investigation.",
