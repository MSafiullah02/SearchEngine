Furthermore, injections of blood serum from an animal that had been given a chance to develop antitoxins to tetanus or diphtheria could confer immunity to the disease on other animals and even cure animals that were already sick. From this, von Behring concluded that immunity was conferred by protective substances in the blood, which he called antitoxins, and that these substances were specific, protecting against only one particular disease (Winau et al., 2004). In the same period in Robert Koch\u2019s laboratory, Paul Ehrlich showed that acquired immunity in mice can be transferred to the offspring from the mother by supplying antibodies to the fetus through the circulation and to the neonate through colostrum (Silverstein, 1996). He was the first to use the term \u201cAntik\u00f6rper\u201d in one of his articles and to define the differences between active and passive immunity.",

Clinical tests with diphtheria serum in early 1894 were successful and in August the chemical company Hoechst started to market \u201cDiphtheria remedy synthesized by Behring-Ehrlich.\u201d In 1904, Paul Ehrlich started developing the imaginative idea that it should be possible to find chemicals that target and kill disease-causing organisms while leaving normal body cells unharmed, which he named \u201cmagic bullets.\u201d He used the term first to describe an antibody and later, a chemical that binds to and specifically kills microbes or tumor cells. Von Behring won the first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1901 for his work on serum therapy, while Ehrlich received a Nobel Prize (together with Elie Metschnikoff) in 1908 for his \u201cside-chain\u201d theory, a chemical theory to explain the formation of antibodies by circulating cells. Their work led to the development of a theory of humoral immunity and opened the door for specific treatment of infections using antisera and antibodies.",

            "text": "Serum therapy was largely used at the beginning of the century but was abandoned owing to hypersensitivity reactions and the introduction of antibiotics in the 1940s. In the second half of the twentieth century, the inability to treat certain viral diseases and the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria drove efforts to develop antibody preparations suitable for oral and systemic administration (Casadevall, 1999, Good and Lorenz, 1991). The development of hybridoma technology for the production of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) provided the means to produce large amount of antibodies with one specificity and isotype (Kohler and Milstein, 1975). Technological advances, such as chimerization and humanization of mAbs, DNA shuffling, and phage display technology led to the generation of antibodies or antibody fragments (scFv and Fab fragment) with improved efficiency and reduced immunogenicity (Chan et al., 2009). New methods of production of antibodies were developed, including recombinant bacteria, insect cells, transgenic plants, and transgenic animals. The discovery of camelidae heavy chain antibody lacking light chains resulted in the development of single domain antibody fragments or nanobody technology (Hamers-Casterman et al., 1993). Meanwhile, a new generation of receptor proteins derived from small and robust non-immunoglobulin \u201cscaffolds\u201d was born (Binz et al., 2005).",

            "text": "The vast majority of infectious agents invade the human body through the epithelial barrier of the gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and respiratory tracts. The mucosal immune system responds by producing large amount of immunoglobulins in mucosal secretions that act as a first line of defense against these pathogens. In humans, secretory IgA (SIgA) represents the most abundant immunoglobulin in body secretions such as saliva, tears, colostrum, and gastrointestinal; together with a variety of innate mucosal defense mechanisms, the function of secretory antibodies is to perform immune exclusion of exogenous antigens (Brandtzaeg, 2007). If the pathogens cross the epithelium and invade the body, locally produced antibodies will no longer determine the fate of the host and systemic immunity will take over. Serum immunoglobulin (particularly immunoglobulin [Ig]G) will then function as a second line of defense by eliminating pathogens that have breached the mucosal barrier. Patients with primary immunodeficiencies involving IgA are known to be highly susceptible to respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections, which supports the notion of a crucial role for antibodies in the mucosal defense and suggests a useful role of passive immunity in the management of mucosal infections (Weiner et al., 1999).",

This probably explains the high proportion of SIgA (90%) and low proportion of IgG (2%) in human colostrum and milk. Immunoglobulin A antibodies in breast milk reflect antigenic stimulation of gut-associated lymphoid tissue and nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue such as the tonsils. Breast milk thus contains antibodies directed against infectious agents and other exogenous antigens in the mother\u2019s environment, which are those likely to be encountered by the infant. Human breast milk may contain SIgA antibodies against a variety of infectious agents such as Vibrio cholera, Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli (ETEC), Shigella, Salmonella, and rotavirus that protect the infected child from developing diarrhea (Lawrence and Pane, 2007).",

            "text": "In animals, the content of Igs in colostrum and milk highly depends on the species (Hurley and Theil, 2011). In ungulate species such as cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs, the young are born essentially agammaglobulinemic and rely entirely on uptake of colostral Igs, especially IgG, for systemic immune protection. Colostral IgG content in these species is typically greater than 75% of the total Ig content. The total amount of Igs may also differ between colostrum and milk and bovine colostrum contains levels of Igs much higher (several 100-fold) than ordinary bovine milk (Hurley and Theil, 2011). Immunoglobulins found in mammary secretions arise from systemic and local sources. In the case of IgG in milk, the major portion comes from the serum and enters via a selective receptor-mediated intracellular route through receptors (FcRn) on the surface of epithelial cells (Mayer et al., 2005). The uptake of milk-derived IgG by the intestine also varies between species. In rats and mice, there is FcRn-mediated uptake of IgG from the colostrum and milk in the neonate intestine. In newborn artiodactyls, all proteins (including IgG) are nonselectively absorbed in the first 12 h after birth and the ability of the enterocytes to pinocytically transport IgG is lost after 24 h (Quigley, 2002). Macromolecules so transported are released into the lamina propria and are then absorbed into the lymphatic or portal circulation.",

It is based on the assumption that a large pool will contain protective levels of antibodies of different specificities including antibodies against many common diseases such as hepatitis A, measles, and rubella. The Ig product is sterile and contains more than 95% purified IgG with small amounts of IgA and IgM. It is used primarily for post-exposure prophylaxis for hepatitis A, rubella, and measles and treatment of certain primary immunodeficiency disorders (X-linked \u03b1-gammaglobulinemia and hypogammaglobulinemia), secondary immunodeficiency (such as B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia), or autoimmune diseases. Historically, Igs were given subcutaneously or intramuscularly because the IgG preparations contained aggregated IgG and impurities that often caused serious reactions when administered intravenously. Today, intravenous Ig (IVIG) and subcutaneous Ig (SCIG) replacement therapy is generally accepted as treatment for selected patients with immunodeficiencies. Currently, the accepted therapy for IgG deficiency is the intravenous administration of 300\u2013600 mg/kg IgG once every 3\u20134 weeks or 100\u2013200 mg/kg/week subcutaneously (Orange et al., 2006). Immunoglobulin therapy, given by both the intravenous and subcutaneous routes, is equally efficacious in infection reduction (Gardulf et al., 2006, Chapel et al., 2000) and decreases the frequency and severity of otitis and respiratory tract infection (Stiehm et al., 2010).",

The concentration of IgY in egg yolk can reach 25 mg/mL. Because a hen can lay up to 250 eggs in a year, the yield of hyperimmunized IgY could be large. Because 160 mg of IgY could be obtained from a single egg, one immunized hen could produce 40 g of IgY in a year, of which 1\u201310% can be expected to be antigen-specific (Hatta et al., 1997). In contrast to mammalian serum, egg yolk contains only a single class of antibody (IgY), which can easily be isolated from the yolk by precipitation techniques, and IgY does not activate mammalian complement or interact with mammalian Fc receptors that could mediate an inflammatory response (Kovacs-Nolan and Mine, 2012).",

In the scFv, the order of the domains can be either VH-linker-VL or VL-linker-VH and in both orientations. The peptide linker is usually a 15-aa linker with the sequence (Gly4Ser)3 (Finlay et al., 2011). The larger Fab is a heterodimer consisting of the variable and first constant domains of heavy (VH-CH) and light chain (VL-CL) segments linked by disulfide bonds. These fragments show similar binding specificities as the original antibodies and a low degree of immunogenicity and are more easily manipulated than the bivalent parent antibody. The smaller size of the fragments permits penetration into tissues inaccessible to full-size mAbs (Yokota et al., 1992). On the downside, fragments demonstrate short circulating half-lives in humans, most likely owing to kidney clearance. The Fab or Fv fragments can be successfully generated from hybridoma cells (Kruger et al., 2002). However, to select antibody fragments with different specificities and a high binding affinity, it is generally preferable to select the fragments directly from a phage library.",

These properties make them suitable for therapy at mucosal sites such as the gastrointestinal tract, where the acidic pH can limit the functionality of conventional antibodies. In addition, owing to their small size and naturally longer CDR3 regions, llama VHH antibody fragments are superior to conventional antibodies at accessing clefts such as active sites of enzymes and canyons on virus capsids (Lauwereys et al., 1998). Their small size also allows them to penetrate tissues and tumors more rapidly and deeply than mAbs. Camelidae heavy chain antibodies have low immunogenicity and are unlikely to exhibit untoward side effects during chronic application (Coppieters et al., 2006). Moreover, camel milk contains heavy chain antibodies and is regularly consumed in African/Arabic countries without adverse effects.",

The advantages of transgenic animals for antibody production would be the low cost production as well as the high quality of the proteins. Farm animals could also be used for the production of polyclonal human antibodies (Houdebine, 2011). Transgenic cattle have been generated by transferring a human artificial chromosome vector carrying the entire unrearranged, human Ig heavy (hIGH) and \u03ba-light (hIGK) chain loci to bovine fibroblasts in which two endogenous bovine IgH chain loci were inactivated (Kuroiwa et al., 2009). The production of only human antibodies awaits for the complete inactivation of the corresponding cow Ig genes. A similar approach is also currently being performed in chickens (Houdebine, 2011).",

Passive immunization against caries was developed using oral administration of antibody preparation against whole cells of Str. mutans or associated virulence factors involved in bacteria adherence (Table 1). Oral administration of hyperimmune bovine milk or chicken antibodies against Str. mutans and glucosyltransferases resulted in a reduction in Str. mutans in dental plaque and caries formation in rats and reduced counts of Str. mutans in saliva or dental plaque in humans (Filler et al., 1991, Hamada et al., 1991, Hatta et al., 1997, Kruger et al., 2004, Loimaranta et al., 1999a, Michalek et al., 1987, Otake et al., 1991). These antibody preparations may protect against Str. mutans by different mechanisms, such as inhibiting the formation of extracellular polysaccharides (glucan and fructan) and preventing the adherence of Str. mutans to salivary coated hydroxyapatite and aggregation of Str. mutans (Loimaranta et al., 1998, Loimaranta et al., 1999b).",

Human volunteers receiving a treatment consisting of oral chlorhexidine disinfection followed by repeated topical applications of anti-AgI/II mAb (Guy\u2019s 13) onto the teeth showed a lack of re-colonization by indigenous Str. mutans for up to 2 years (Ma et al., 1989, Ma et al., 1990). Because the functional mAb was only detected on the teeth for only up to 3 days after application, it was speculated that the ecological niche vacated by Str. mutans was filled by other bacteria (Ma et al., 1990). This mAb was subsequently re-engineered as a chimeric IgA/IgG Ab with a rabbit secretory component for expression in tobacco plants. The plant-derived SIgA/G (CaroRx Planet Biotechnology) was reported to be effective in passive immunization trials in humans (Ma et al., 1995, Ma et al., 1998) although another study reported only a trend in reducing colonization by Str. mutans (Weintraub et al., 2005).

Modified lactobacilli could prevent caries by different mechanisms such as blocking the SAI/II adhesion and aggregation of Str. mutans in combination with the production of inhibitory substances (e.g., bacteriocin) (Kruger et al., 2005). A VHH antibody fragment against the SAI/II adhesin (S36-VHH) also reduced the development of smooth surface caries in the desalivated rat caries model (Kruger et al., 2006).",

One option is thus to develop mAbs that target the capsular polysaccharide of the serotypes causing most infection and to give the mAbs as a mixture. Intraperitoneal administration of mAbs to the capsular polysaccharide protects mice against a lethal systemic or intranasal challenge with Str. pneumoniae serotype III (Chang et al., 2002, Fabrizio et al., 2010a, Fabrizio et al., 2010b, Tian et al., 2009, Weber et al., 2012). Some of these protective mAbs do not promote phagocytosis in vitro. Their efficacy may depend on their capacity to agglutinate and alter the expression of gene involved in quorum sensing, tricking the bacteria to kill each other (fratricide) (Fabrizio et al., 2007, Tian et al., 2009, Yano et al., 2011).",

Furthermore, a single intranasal administration of IgY or hyperimmune bovine colostrum (HBC) anti-H1N1 is both prophylactically and therapeutically protective against an intranasal challenge with influenza virus (Ng et al., 2010, Nguyen et al., 2010). The HA protein is responsible for receptor binding to host cells and for viral entry and elicits the most robust neutralizing antibodies during vaccination or natural infection. Several groups reported that systemic or intranasal administration of mAbs against HA provides protection of mice against a lethal intranasal challenge with the virus (Prabakaran et al., 2009, Prabhu et al., 2009, Tan et al., 2012, Throsby et al., 2008, Ye et al., 2010). Antigenic drift, caused by periodic amino acid changes on the globular head of hemagglutinin (HA), is one of the hallmarks of influenza A virus immune evasion and the synergistic action of two or more mAbs in combination may be required to prevent the generation of escape mutants (Prabhu et al., 2009, Prabakaran et al., 2009). An alternative is to develop antibodies targeting the conserved region of the HA and capable of recognizing and neutralizing a diverse number of influenza A virus subtypes (Ekiert et al., 2009, Tan et al., 2012). A broadly neutralizing mAb (CR6261) was shown to bind to the highly conserved helical region in the HA stem/stalk domain (Ekiert et al., 2009, Throsby et al., 2008). The antibody, developed by Crucell (The Netherlands), is currently undergoing a phase I clinical trial fusing a single intravenous dose.",

Palivizumab (Synagis, MedImmune, Gaithersburg, MD) is a humanized IgG1 mAb directed against the antigenic site II of the F glycoprotein, and blocks virus fusion, most likely through inhibiting the conformational changes in the F protein required for this process (Huang et al., 2010). Palivizumab is licensed for the reduction of severe lower respiratory tract RSV infection in high-risk infants and children. Both palivizumab and RSV-IGIV similarly decrease the incidence of RSV hospitalization (by 30\u201360%) and intensive care unit admission but RSV-IGIV results in more adverse effects and requires intravenous access (Morris et al., 2009). Palivizumab might also be a viable option for prophylaxis against RSV in patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation, pre-engraftment, during graft-versus-host disease, and when treated with high-dose steroids (Kassis et al., 2010).",

Furthermore, vaginally administered b12 and VRC01 protect against mucosal SHIV challenge in animal models, which suggests the use of antibodies as potential vaginal microbicides (Veazey et al., 2003, Veselinovic et al., 2012). In humans, infusion with the neutralizing mAbs 4E10, 2F5, and 2G12 reduced viral rebound in HIV-1-infected individuals (Trkola et al., 2005). The same three mAbs are being assessed as a gel-formulated microbicide in a phase I clinical trial (Morris et al., 2010). High concentrations of neutralizing mAbs show promise for microbicide formulations but they are prohibitively expensive to produce in the amounts required. Consequently, the anti-HIV-neutralizing antibodies 2F5 and 2G12 have been expressed at high levels in plants and excellent results have been obtained in terms of production and neutralizing activity (Marusic et al., 2009, Rademacher et al., 2008, Ramessar et al., 2008).",

Today, passive antibody administration is used to treat and prevent diseases caused by hepatitis B virus, rabies virus, RSV, Cl. tetani, Cl. botulinum, vaccinia virus, echovirus, and enterovirus (Casadevall et al., 2004). The administration of horse antitoxin remains the only specific therapy available for botulism. Antibodies can be administered as human or animal plasma or serum; as pooled human Ig for intravenous (IVIG), intramuscular (IMIG), and subcutaneous (SCIG) use; as high-titer human IVIG or IMIG from immunized or convalescing donors; or as mAb. In patients with PAD, prophylactic replacement therapy by SCIG or intravenous IMIG is the method of choice to prevent infections.",

Antibodies against various other microorganisms including H. pylori and E. coli are under research development. Renewed interest in antibody-based therapies is the consequence of major advances in the technology of antibody production combined with the need for new therapeutic agents against emerging diseases (Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome, bird flu, West Nile virus, and bioterrorism agents) and new antibiotic-resistant microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Enterococci, and Cl. difficile). However, although antibodies have proven to be good antimicrobial agents, only one mAb, palivizumab, is licensed for an infectious disease (RSV infection). It is hoped that advances in genomics and proteomics will result in improved knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms of pathogenicity. The possibility of generating fully human antibodies from transgenic, humanized mice, and perhaps in the near future transgenic humanized cows, as well as new developments in phage library technology will accelerate the development of antibody production. Furthermore, production of antibodies at lower cost using transgenic plants and transgenic cows as well as in situ delivery of antibody fragments by recombinant bacteria will lead to new applications of antibodies as therapeutics against infectious disease, such as mucosal delivery. Antibodies engineered in different formats and fused to other antimicrobials will result in increased potency and new molecular methods will render them non-immunogenic. All of these new developments will contribute to the realization of Erhlich\u2019s dream: magic bullets.",
