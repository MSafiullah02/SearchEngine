In these cases, major antigenic variants of influenza A (antigenic shift) may be generated through genetic reassortment between virus strains of human and avian origin (the largest reservoir of influenza A strains) in host mammals susceptible to both infections, such as swine. Viruses circulating in different animal species may also be introduced directly into the human population [2]. Avian influenza viruses of the H5, H7, and H9 subtypes have also been associated with sporadic infections in humans. The level of herd immunity in humans to new reassortant viruses is usually very low, making it possible their rapid spread worldwide (pandemics) and underlies the increased virulence of pandemic influenza A strains.",

In Italy, seasonal influenza epidemics are associated with an annual average of about 8000 excess deaths.

Due to the constant emergence of antigenic drift variants under herd immunity pressure, the Influenza vaccine needs yearly update to include the escape variants detected during each seasonal epidemic which are predicted to circulate during the next winter\u2013spring season. This update is organized by the WHO through the network of sentinel practitioners and reference laboratories (INFLUNET). If the viruses in the vaccine are closely matched to those circulating in the community, vaccine effectiveness is greater. However, even when the viruses are not closely related, the vaccine can still be expected to provide some cross-protection against different, but related, strains of influenza viruses. Based on the limited cross-protection between the two influenza B lineages and the inability to accurately predict which influenza B lineage will circulate, a quadrivalent influenza vaccine including both influenza B strains [5] has recently been approved by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency. Pharmaceutical companies will likely transition to predominantly producing the quadrivalent vaccine.",

            "text": "Successful immunization depends on an intact immune system that can produce antibodies and T-cell response upon antigen exposure. Patients with cancer are considered functionally immunosuppressed, due to their underlying disease and/or cancer therapy. As a consequence, they may have a suboptimal serologic response to influenza vaccination. Although antiviral prophylaxis has been recently used for prevention of influenza virus infection in specific clinical settings such as perivaccine prophylaxis, postexposure prophylaxis, family cluster prophylaxis, as well as seasonal prophylaxis [5], vaccination is the most effective method for widespread prevention of influenza infection. Indeed, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) in the United States recommends seasonal influenza vaccination for adults without contraindications, who have disease- or medication-related immunosuppression (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/high_risk.htm). However, knowledge of serologic response to seasonal influenza vaccine remains scanty in patients with cancer and is particularly sparse in those with solid tumors [7]. Tumor heterogeneity, timing of influenza vaccination relative to different chemotherapy treatments, and a general lack of data concerning the vaccine efficacy against influenza infection, or its complications, make it difficult to compare the clinical studies so far reported in the literature. The results of eight controlled clinical trials looking at the efficacy of influenza vaccination in pediatric cancer patients were reviewed [8]. Children receiving chemotherapy were able to generate immune responses to the vaccine, albeit more weakly than healthy children, children with asthma or children with cancer who had completed chemotherapy more than 1 month before vaccination. Influenza vaccine was safely administered, and there were no reports of persistent adverse reactions in any of the studies, although patients receiving chemotherapy had a higher incidence of general malaise following vaccination. None of these studies reported on clinical outcome. Seroprotection (antibody titer >40) and seroconversion (at least a fourfold rise in HI titers) were achieved in patients with an established diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disorders [9, 10], irrespective of the previous chemotherapy administration.",

            "text": "Data regarding timing of influenza vaccination with regard to chemotherapy administration in adults with solid tumors and hematological malignancies are limited to three studies: one published in 1977 [15], two in recent years [4, 16]. Overall, 126 patients have been investigated in such studies. Despite the paucity of data in a heterogeneous patient population, it can be suggested that tor patients with solid tumors, if possible, vaccination should be given mid-cycle, preferably 2 weeks after chemotherapy and/or before administration of the subsequent cycle. For patients with hematologic malignancies, the highest serologic response appears to occur following vaccination administered when the leukocyte count is normal and just before initiation of a cycle. In a recently published review article, Polleya et al. recommend vaccination at the furthest possible time point away from treatment during a given cycle [17].",

While patients' isolation is not practically feasible, and would not be ethical, vaccination of household contacts and health care personnel is of pivotal importance for increasing the level of herd immunity in the local environment with consequent reduction of influenza virus circulation and likelihood of infection. Moreover, strict preventive measures should be adopted in oncology wards when hospitalized patients develop influenza-like illness, even before the results of viral testing are known. All hygiene precautions (hand washing, surgical masks, etc.) should be enforced together with restrictions on visitors suspected of having respiratory illness. Leukemic children receiving maintenance chemotherapy (lasting 2\u20133 years) have been reported to be more susceptible to viral infections, probably due to their higher exposure to infected people during school or daycare contacts.
