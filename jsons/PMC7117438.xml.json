            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses that differ according to their antigenic reactivity. The antigenic group 1 includes feline coronavirus (FCoV), canine coronavirus (CCV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and the human coronavirus HCV 229E (Horzinek et al., 1982, Wege et al., 1982). FCoV and CCV are chiefly transmitted by the exposure of susceptible individuals to virus in the feces of infected hosts (Pedersen et al., 1981, Tennant et al., 1993, Foley et al., 1997) and rarely in saliva (Addie and Jarrett, 2001). CCV and FCoV frequently cause relatively benign enteric infections in domestic dogs and cats, respectively, that are normally confined to the digestive tract and regional lymph nodes (Pedersen et al., 1981, Evermann et al., 1989). However, in a small percentage of FCoV infected domestic cats (Addie and Jarrett, 1992) more virulent strains may develop by mutations, which are able to invade and replicate in macrophages causing a virulent fatal disease termed feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) (Pedersen et al., 1981, Evermann et al., 1991, Poland et al., 1996, Vennema et al., 1998). FIP is an immune-mediated disease that involves an antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of virus infection and an immune complex-induced pathology (Horzinek and Osterhaus, 1979). Possible synergistic infections of coronavirus and other pathogens may result in severe clinical signs (Appel, 1988).",

Prevalence of exposure to FCoV in domestic cat populations is normally between 20 and 50%, but may be as high as 90%, depending on husbandry conditions (Rolle and Mayr, 2002). Exposure to CCV in domestic dog populations also varies widely (16\u201370%) in relation to husbandry (Herbst et al., 1988, Buxbaum, 1993, Naylor et al., 2001). High levels of exposure to coronaviruses have been reported in some wild species of carnivores, including wolves (Canis lupis) in Alaska, where prevalence among adults varied between 32% in autumn and 76% in spring (Zarnke et al., 2001), and lions (Panthera leo) in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, where exposure was approximately 60% (Hofmann-Lehmann et al., 1996). In contrast, comparatively low levels of exposure to coronaviruses (3, 4 and 6%, respectively) have been reported in lions in Etosha National Park, Namibia (Spencer and Morkel, 1993), and in wild cats (Felis silvestris) on the European mainland (Leutenegger et al., 1999) and Scotland (Daniels et al., 1999).",

The spotted hyena, which is the most numerous large carnivore species in the ecosystem, with a population estimated at approximately 9000 animals (Hofer and East, 1995), may also be a potential host for coronavirus. Currently, little is known about coronavirus infection in most Serengeti carnivore populations (Hofmann-Lehmann et al., 1996) and what strains of coronavirus infect these populations. It is also not known whether such infections are maintained in single or multi-species associations. A large (over 1 million) human population (Campbell and Hofer, 1995) and associated domestic cats and dogs live within a 45 km zone outside the western boundary of the Serengeti National Park. These domestic animals may be a large reservoir for coronavirus, although the contribution of domestic animals to the epidemiology of coronavirus in carnivore species in the Serengeti is currently unknown.",

There was no obvious pattern to the locations of these differences, with respect to other strains of CCV and FCoV type II and the absence of shared blocks of homology with either CCV or FCoV type II genes suggests that the hyena isolate is probably not the result of recombination events between CCV and FCoV type II genes. The level of divergence of the hyena isolate from strains of CCV and FCoV based on maximum-likelihood values (Fig. 2\n), suggests an early split from a common ancestor and sufficient isolated evolution in hyenas to form a new coronavirus subgroup that is distinct from the domestic feline- and canine-like subgroups.",

This may explain the more frequent detection of viral nucleic acids in their feces than in the feces of adults. Spotted hyenas often defecate in communal latrines (Kruuk, 1972), and young spotted hyenas stationed at clan communal dens use communal latrines within the vicinity of the den (East and Hofer, unpublished). In addition, during ritualized greeting ceremonies, hyenas sniff the anal area of greeting partners (East et al., 1993). Thus, infection of susceptible hyenas via contact with virus-laden feces is likely to play an important role in the transmission of the coronavirus within the spotted hyena population. This is in accordance with current knowledge of transmission of coronavirus in domestic dogs and cats, where the fecal-oral route plays the most important role and first infection usually occurs within a few weeks of birth (Addie and Jarrett, 1990, Foley et al., 1997). Either current infection or repeated exposure to coronavirus may have increased antibody production and induced the high titer levels (\u22651:320) found in some hyenas.",

As it is known that FCoV type II arose from recombination events between FCoV type I and CCV, the high level of homology between FCoV type II, CCV and the isolate from the Serengeti spotted hyena is expected. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that the spotted hyena isolate has split from a common ancestor and has undergone sufficient isolated evolution to result in a new coronavirus subgroup that is distinct from the domestic feline- and canine-subtypes (Fig. 2). This would suggest that high levels of exposure among Serengeti hyenas are mainly due to intra-specific infection. However, as spotted hyenas occasionally eat the feces of carnivores such as lions, contact with coronavirus contained in feces of other wild carnivores is possible, and may contribute to levels of exposure and infection in spotted hyenas. It is currently unknown whether the isolate we have described in spotted hyenas also infects other Serengeti carnivores. Our genetic results also suggest that infection among Serengeti hyenas is more likely due to viral transmission within the hyena population than due to transmission from infected domestic cats or dogs in areas surrounding the National Park. To obtain a better understanding of the genetic relationship between coronavirus isolates present in the Serengeti ecosystem, and the involvement of different carnivore species in the transmission and maintenance of the virus in carnivore populations, further genetic characterization of isolates from different wild and domestic carnivore species is required. The clinical consequences of coronavirus infection in spotted hyenas should also be clarified.",
