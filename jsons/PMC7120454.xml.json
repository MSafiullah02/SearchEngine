Over the course of the next \u223c20 years, an additional seven serotypes of human astroviruses were discovered [5, 21, 29, 31, 32]. However, new technological advances in virus discovery and detection methods have brought about a dramatic realization that more astroviruses can be found in humans than previously recognized and that there is more diversity amongst them than was assumed based on comparisons of human astroviruses 1\u20138. This chapter will describe the discovery and early characterization of the five novel astroviruses initially identified in human stool samples in 2008 and 2009.",

            "text": "The age of molecular biology has had an impact on virology just as it has on many other fields. In particular, the invention of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the 1980s made it easy to detect viral genomes. If the appropriate sequences are available, it is quite easy to design primers to detect a given virus of interest. Analogous to the use of primers that target 16S ribosomal genes of bacteria for identification and classification of bacterial species, primers can often be designed to highly conserved regions of the genomes of viruses from a particular family or lower taxa. Such PCR assays can be used to identify novel viruses which happen to be closely related to existing viruses. Various computational strategies have been described for the specific design of consensus PCR primers to use for novel virus identification [24, 45]. The breadth of PCR assays is limited to interrogating a single taxon, which can be a limitation when there is no information to focus the efforts towards a particular group of viruses. However, there are numerous examples of viruses discovered in this fashion, with two notable instances being the identification of sin nombre virus [40] and human coronavirus HKU1 [53]. As will be discussed later in this chapter, PCR assays that were designed after the discovery of novel astrovirus MLB1 were used to identify additional novel astroviruses.",

            "text": "Dideoxy sequencing or Sanger sequencing, first described in 1977 [46], was the dominant DNA sequencing technology used for nearly 30 years. The typical sequence read length for Sanger sequencing can reach \u223c750\u2013800 bp. Sanger sequencing is carried out individually for each sequence, so the number of sequences that can be generated for a single sample is simply a function of cost and time. This technology was the cornerstone of all significant sequencing projects up until \u223c2005, including the sequencing of the human genome. Starting in 2005, multiple new sequencing technology platforms (\u201cNextGen\u201d) emerged that have now far surpassed conventional Sanger sequencing in terms of increased total sequence production capacity and decreased cost. With NextGen platforms, sequences can be modified to encode specific strings of bases that serve as barcodes for individual samples, such that many samples can be combined into a single run on the NextGen machines. The NextGen platform that has been most widely used for virus detection and sequencing is 454 pyrosequencing [44]. At the time of the studies described in this chapter, one 454 sequencing run produced \u223c400,000 sequence reads of an average read length of \u223c250\u2013400 bp [35]. Both Sanger sequencing and 454 pyrosequencing have been used in the discovery and sequencing of novel astroviruses.",

            "text": "Human rotaviruses and noroviruses are the leading causes of viral diarrhea [9, 42, 52] while human astroviruses have been associated with up to \u223c10% of sporadic cases of viral diarrhea in children [19, 51] and with 0.5\u201315% of outbreaks [2, 33, 48]. However, the cause of approximately 12\u201341% of the cases of sporadic diarrhea and gastroenteritis outbreaks remains undetermined despite extensive testing [25, 33, 48]. One hypothesis for the cause of such a diagnostic gap is that there are unidentified pathogens contributing to the burden of disease. This was the guiding principle of the initial study that led to the identification of Astrovirus MLB1 (AstV-MLB1) [12]. Stool samples from children with cases of acute, sporadic diarrhea were subjected to \u201cmicro-mass sequencing\u201d meaning that only limited sequencing was done (384 sequences) per sample in contrast to the typically tens of thousands of sequences generated per sample using NextGen sequencing platforms that were used in studies described later in this chapter. One of the most interesting findings of the study was the detection of sequences, within one sample collected in 1999 from a 35-month-old child, that were most closely related to human astroviruses. These sequences were highly divergent from canonical human astroviruses 1\u20138, suggesting that a novel virus might be present. There were seven unique sequence reads derived from two loci that displayed 42\u201361% amino acid identity to human astroviruses. The sequence reads overlapped such that they could be assembled into two contiguous stretches of sequence referred to as contigs. RT-PCR was used to confirm the accuracy of the assembled contigs and subsequent sequencing of the amplicons confirmed the presence of the contigs in the original RNA extract. One contig was \u223c800 bp long and mapped to ORF1a, the serine protease, of the astrovirus genome and the other one was \u223c500 bp long and mapped to ORF1b, the RNA polymerase. Phylogenetic analysis of the two contigs yielded trees that demonstrated that these sequences in fact represented a novel astrovirus (Fig. 7.1).\n",

            "text": "This novel astrovirus was named Astrovirus MLB1 (AstV-MLB1) because it was identified in a stool sample from a child in Melbourne, Australia. In the follow-up study, the complete genome of AstV-MLB1 was sequenced to an average of >3X coverage [GenBank: FJ222451] and the virus was further characterized [14]. The AstV-MLB1 genome is organized like that of other astroviruses in that it is predicted to encode three open reading frames (ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2) and contain both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 nontranslated regions (NTR), as well as a poly-A tail. AstV-MLB1 has a shorter genome than other astroviruses with only 6,171 bp (excluding the poly-A tail) compared to the range for the other astroviruses of \u223c6,400\u20137,300 bp [37] (Table 7.1). This is in large due to two deletions, totaling 57 amino acids, located within a highly conserved 144 amino acid motif near the carboxyl terminus of human astroviruses 1\u20138. The motif has been mapped as an immunoreactive epitope in human astroviruses [36] and is located in the nonstructural protein p38 [28], a protein reported to be involved in replication [20] and particle release [38]. The effect this deletion has on the replication of AstV-MLB1 has yet to be determined. Another difference between AstV-MLB1 and the canonical human astroviruses arises in the 3 C-like protease motif in the putative \u00adsubstrate binding residues. The canonical human astroviruses share the conserved residues RTQ whereas AstV-MLB1 is identical to ovine astrovirus with the residues ATR. Again, the meaning of this difference is yet to be explored.\n",

            "text": "AstV-MLB1 further differs from the canonical human astroviruses in some of its noncoding features. The 5\u2032 nontranslated region (NTR) is only 14 nucleotides long which is more comparable to the 5\u2032 NTRs of avian astroviruses (\u223c10\u201320 nt) than to the 5\u2032 NTRs of human astroviruses 1\u20138 (80\u201385 nt long, 37) (Table 7.1). Furthermore, human astroviruses 1\u20138 contain a 120 nt region at the junction between ORF1b and ORF2 that is highly conserved with a 52 nt core region that is 99\u2013100% identical among the human astrovirus serotypes [50]. It is hypothesized that this sequence serves as a regulatory element of the sub-genomic RNA that encodes the capsid. AstV-MLB1 is only 61.5% identical to other human astroviruses in the 52 nt core region. This is similar to the level of identity (44\u201359.6%) shared between the known animal astroviruses and the human astroviruses. Lastly, there is a conserved RNA secondary structure, referred to as the stem-loop II-like motif (s2m), that is in the nontranslated region (NTR) at the 3\u2032 end of the genome in all previously described astroviruses except turkey astrovirus 2 [39]. It is thought to interact with viral and cellular proteins needed for RNA replication and to be quite important because (1) it is also found in some other RNA viruses and (2) compensatory mutations that restore base pairing are often seen when there are mutations in the conserved motif [39]. AstV-MLB1 not only lacks this conserved nucleotide motif but it also has the shortest 3\u2032NTR reported to date for an astrovirus. It is not clear the importance of any of these differences in the coding or noncoding regions of the AstV-MLB1 genome compared to other astroviruses, but these may be interesting avenues of research in the future.",

There are actually very few regions of conservation between AstV-MLB1 and the canonical human astroviruses in which primers can be designed and this is evidenced by the fact that two groups independently designed nearly identical primers [15, 54].

The samples tested negative for enteric parasites, bacteria, and viruses so they were subjected to high-throughput pyrosequencing and Sanger sequencing by two different groups that reported their findings together [16]. Unique sequences were detected in two of the samples by pryosequencing: 313 sequences in one sample and 1,017 sequences in the other. Astrovirus-like sequences were assembled together into contigs of 6,376 nucleotides (nt) and 6,026 nt from the two samples. These contigs had limited sequence similarity (37\u201371% aa identity) to proteins from the mink and ovine astroviruses. When the two contigs were assembled together they generated a contig of 6,581 nt in length. The Sanger sequencing that was done simultaneously also resulted in the detection of unique astrovirus-like sequences in the same two samples: 3 in one sample and 69 in the other. Further RT-PCR amplifications and 5\u2032 RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) reactions were used to determine that the full length of the virus is 6,586 nt, excluding the poly-A tail (Table 7.1).

These diarrhea samples were negative for rotavirus by enzyme immunoassay and PCR, for norovirus by PCR, for bacterial pathogens (Vibrio cholerae, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Aeromonas, and Plesiomonas) by culture, biochemical reactions and serogrouping where appropriate and for parasites by routine saline and iodine preparations and modified acid fast stain. Control samples consisted of asymptomatic stool samples obtained from the same child at least 6 weeks prior to the collection of the diarrhea stool. These case and control stools were examined by astrovirus consensus primers which target the RNA polymerase [15]. Samples which were positive by the consensus primers were then screened by RT-PCR using primers specific for AstV-MLB1 and ones to detect the classic human astroviruses. In this study, 4 of the cases and 14 of the controls were positive for AstV-MLB1. Therefore, AstV-MLB1 was less likely to be present in the diarrheal samples than in the asymptomatic samples (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.09\u20130.89, p  =  0.033).",

One of these challenges is what to name these new viruses and how to decide if they represent new species. Previously, astroviruses were named for the species they infect (human, turkey, etc.). The classic human species consists of eight closely related serotypes which are named 1\u20138. In a similar fashion, the HMO astrovirus names are derived from their relationship to human, mink and ovine astroviruses. On the other hand, AstV-MLB1, AstV-VA1, and AstV-PS are named for the site that the sample originated from. A more uniform and instructive naming system needs to be put in place. Kapoor et al. have suggested a naming scheme in which human astroviruses 1\u20138 are renamed HAstV-1 with a letter (a\u2013h) following the name to denote each serotype and then naming the novel astroviruses described in this chapter HAstV-2\u2013HAstV [27]. This issue of nomenclature is currently being addressed by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) study group for Astroviruses.

There is a major gap in our understanding of the causes of diarrhea, given that \u223c40% of all cases are of unknown etiology [25, 33, 48]. While astroviruses are known to cause diarrhea, they have generally been associated with at most 10% of both sporadic and outbreak cases of acute diarrhea. The initial identification of five novel astroviruses in human stool samples over the course of a 2-year period hints that astroviruses may have a larger role in causing human diarrhea than previously believed. Prior to 2008, there were eight known human astroviruses that are all genetically very closely related. It is possible that this paradigm will be upheld for each of the newly described astroviruses in that each one could represent a whole new cluster of astroviruses.

Answering these questions will require many years of further investigation, using the available tools of biology and medicine. While all of the recently discovered astroviruses described in this chapter were first identified in stool samples, some have now been detected in other biological specimens or in stools from people without diarrhea. These findings are in no way conclusive, but they do reveal the possibility that astroviruses may be associated with other diseases in humans. The major questions for all of these viruses are (1) Are they truly human pathogens? and (2) If so, what diseases do they cause? These questions are difficult to answer short of doing human infection trials. However, the studies described in this chapter have begun to address these questions.",
