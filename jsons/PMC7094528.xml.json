Parents were contacted twice a week by telephone or e-mail by 1 of the 2 study coordinators to determine the presence of any symptoms of respiratory tract illness. Respiratory tract symptoms were defined as symptoms of coryza (rhinorrhea or nasal congestion), sore throat, earache with or without ear discharge, cough, sputum production, or dyspnea, all with or without temperature above 38\u00b0C.",

In the literature, the prevalence of respiratory pathogens in samples from asymptomatic children ranges from 5% to 68%.3, 18, 19, 20, 21 This wide range may be explained by differences in study populations, definitions of symptoms, and sampling and virus detection methods. Most of these studies were performed in older children, usually hospitalized for elective surgery. Furthermore, most of the studies are of a cross-sectional design comparing single symptomatic and asymptomatic episodes in different subjects. Such a design disregards the natural variation of virus colonization in an individual during a certain period. Winther et al20 also sampled longitudinally and found a 9% prevalence of picornavirus in asymptomatic children. This discrepancy with our findings may be explained by the fact that those authors used a period of 4 weeks around the onset of respiratory illness to define symptomatic episodes.",
