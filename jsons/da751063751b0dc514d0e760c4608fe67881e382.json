            "text": "Today's world had experienced several generation of the Internet. If the first generation of fixed Internet [1] which had virtually connected the infinite network of computer offered a chance for people collaboration and interaction between each other without regard for geographic location, the second generation of the Internet which is the Mobile Internet [2, 3] provided more flexibility and convenience to the user by combining telecommunication with the Internet. So people can connect anywhere, anytime with their mobile devices and accelerating the rapid increase in the number of Internet users recently. This is also paving a new path to the next generation of the Internet where every things and objects can be ubiquitously connected to the Internet to create the Internet of Things (IoT) [4] . One of the question is \"what is the future Internet after the era of IoT?\" Research scientists now start to discuss about the next vision in the future which is the Tactile Internet [5, 6] . The Tactile Internet is expected to create a potential market and a plethora of new business opportunities as well as applications that could reshape our life and economy. First coined in 2014 [5] , Tactile Internet is considered as the communication method over the Internet with typical characteristic such as ultra-low latency in combination with high availability, reliability and security in order to mimic the same as human tactile reaction sense on the Internet environment. Therefore, the data lifecycle must be made within 1ms from the sensors to the actuators otherwise 'cyber-sickness' may occur [7] when users feel disoriented in an experience similar to the motion sickness sometimes suffered in the air or on the road. Developing new architectures and enabling extremely low-latency endto-end communications to render the Tactile Internet vision realistic is one of the main motivation.",

As a result, novel learning experiences are driven to a new level of possibilities by the improvements in the training of specific fine-motor skills. \uf0b7 Healthcare: By reuniting the medical experts and doctors via the Tactile Internet during remote diagnosis and treatment, the better healthcare quality could be happen. In addition, experienced surgeons' tactile sense could be combined with the high spatial precision of robot-assisted operations to cure patients in isolated environments. \uf0b7 Energy: The Tactile Internet could be one of the foundation technologies for smart grid to improve energy efficiency and stability in electricity networks. The powerful computing capability and super agility of the Tactile Internet infrastructure enables dynamic activation and deactivation of local power generation and consumption in the decentralized electrical energy generation and distribution networks. This will potentially result in minimize the generation of unusable reactive power. \uf0b7 Smart city: The Tactile Internet can offer some solutions for the management and operation in the Smart City. It can create of a personal spatial safety zone, or 'bubble', to assist people to interact with nearby objects. The traffic flow in the Smart City can be optimized thanks to cooperative traffic methods in the Tactile Internet. Guided autonomous driving will enable for a continuous traffic flow in which safety and energy efficiency can be significantly improved in the Smart City environment. \uf0b7 Culture: By providing new methods in human-tohuman, human-to-machine interaction, the Tactile  Internet can create new behaviors, habits, perceptions not only in many aspect of culture, society, but also in the economy.",

            "text": "To achieve the envisioned Tactile Internet, there are some major problems and the architecture design requirements need to be solved. The biggest challenge is how to provide ultra-low end-to-end latency of 1ms along with the highest possible reliability for real-time response of the data lifecycle in this technology. Figure 2 . presents a typical latency budget of a data lifecycle from value sensing to decisions making on the Tactile Internet environment. Besides, data security, the availability and dependability of systems that non-violate the low latency requirement due to encryption and authentication delays are the important criteria. These technical requirements of the Tactile Internet pose tremendous challenges for communications systems. The physical limit of the speed of light causing communication delay needs to be considered as well. For example, the maximum distance for a steering/control server to be placed from the point of tactile interaction by the users is 150km away (speed of light = 300km/ms) [5] . Paradigm shifts are necessary to overcome these obstacles. By distributed and decentralized service platform architecture to keep tactile applications local and close to the users, the combination of Mobile Edge-Clouds, Mini Cloud and a multi-stage hierarchy of cloud platform can be deployed as Figure 3 . Additionally, communications from sensors to actuators is associated with extremely demanding requirements on both hardware and software. Intelligent data compression methods combining with \"in-network processing\" such as Network Coding, Software Defined Network [10] at every node between the source and the destination can speed up the process of decision making and reduce the delay. Furthermore, new ideas and concepts to boost the requirement of stringent latency, reliability, and also capacity in both wired and wireless access network. Last but not least, edge intelligence to facilitate predictive caching as well as interpolation/extrapolation of human actions is the solution to overcome 1ms-at-speed-of-lightlimit. This allow spatially decouple the active and reactive end(s) of the Tactile Internet since the tactile experience is virtually emulated on either ends. As a result, allows a much wider geographic separation between the tactile ends. It is necessary to develop novel artificial intelligence techniques based on predictive actuation for edge cloud architectures.",
