Viruses cause a variety of pathological conditions of occasionally pandemic proportions, and constitute potential major threats to the human population [1]. Even after the development of vaccines, which have been tremendously effective in controlling many viral infections, viruses are still among the most common human pathogens, sometimes causing life-threatening diseases [1]. The latter is evident from recent epidemics, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), caused by the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by the SARS corona virus 2, 3.",

Viruses might usurp the regulation of and change host-cell functions for their benefit. Indeed, through molecules encoded by viral genetic material, whose expression is synchronized with specific phases of the viral life cycle, viruses increase the chance of their own replication and survival. Virus-induced alterations of host-cell functions cause a broad spectrum of cellular damage, from a transient, mild change of function to neoplastic transformation, apoptosis and necrosis. Recent research has revealed that viruses, through the molecules they encode, modulate endocrine signaling systems in the host to cause characteristic changes in both endocrine organs and hormone target tissues.",

ATL patients infected with HTLV-1 may also develop hypercalcemia because of aberrant expression of parathyroid hormone (PTH)-related protein (PTHrP) [17]. PTHrP is a 141 amino acid protein that shares significant N-terminal sequence homology with PTH [18]. In humans, PTHrP is present in many normal and neoplastic tissues, whereas PTH is present only in the parathyroid gland [18]. Leukemic cells from ATL patients, as well as lymphocytes from asymptomatic HTLV-1-positive carriers, contain high levels of PTHrP; the secreted protein exerts biological effects that are similar to those of PTH because PTHrP binds to the PTH receptor and stimulates downstream cellular events [18]. Hence, PTHrP, like PTH, increases serum Ca2+ concentrations by stimulating bone turnover and enhancing Ca2+ absorption from the kidney and the gut [18].",

            "text": "Accumulating evidence indicates that the HTLV-1-encoded Tax protein stimulates PTHrP synthesis in HTLV-1-infected lymphocytes by activating the PTHrP promoter [11]. Tax is a nuclear phosphoprotein of either 37 or 40 kDa that is required for transactivation of the HTLV-1 LTR and the transformation of T cells [19]. Tax does not bind DNA directly but transactivates numerous cellular genes by interacting physically with host transcription factors [19]. Tax appears to stimulate the promoter activity of the gene that encodes PTHrP by communicating with multiple transcription factors, including activator protein 1 (AP1), AP2, Est1 and SP1 [11]. Tax forms a ternary complex with Est1 and SP1, and their binding to the PTHrP promoter strongly stimulates its transcriptional activity [20]. Aggravated hypercalcemia, however, is observed most often in end-stage ATL when Tax expression is relatively low [11]. Mice infected experimentally with Tax-defective HTLV-1 have high levels of PTHrP and develop hypercalcemia [21]. Thus, as yet unknown viral factors appear to contribute to the development of HTLV-1-associated hypercalcemia in addition to Tax.",

Moreover, glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) are present at normal concentrations on peripheral leukocytes and the affinity of these receptors for dexamethasone is similar to that of controls. Therefore, biochemical hypercortisolism is not likely to be a major cause of immunosuppression, muscle wasting and AIDS-related lipodystrophy and insulin resistance. Rather, either localized or tissue-specific hypersensitivity to glucocorticoids might be involved in these phenomena [10]. Furthermore, hypersensitivity to glucocorticoids might explain the increased vulnerability of AIDS patients to HHV-8 infections and the development of Kaposi sarcoma [28].",

These proteins regulate many signal transduction cascades mediated by transcription factors, including NRs, CRE-binding protein (CREB), AP-1, nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u2013B) and the signal transducers and activators of transcription [33]. p300 and CBP have intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity and attract other histone acetyltransferase coactivators, such as the p300/CBP-interacting factor (p/CAF) and p160-type nuclear receptor coactivator proteins to the transcription initiation site [33]. Thus, p300/CBP act as regulatory \u2018platforms\u2019 for the transcription of numerous host genes, regulating transcriptional activity of many trans-acting factors and NRs (Figure 2\n). Vpr contains a NR coactivator box. This is similar to those on p160 and p300/CBP NR coactivators, potentiating the effect of ligand-bound GR and p160. Vpr penetrates the cell membrane easily to exert its biological effects even when added in the media surrounding the cells [34], thus, its effects might extend to tissues that are not infected with HIV-1.",

Because Tat, like Vpr, circulates in blood and exerts its actions as either an auto/paracrine or an endocrine factor by penetrating the cell membrane [36], it is possible that Tat modulates tissue sensitivity to glucocorticoids irrespective of whether a cell is infected with HIV-1. Concomitantly with Vpr, Tat might induce tissue hypersensitivity to glucocorticoids that might contribute to viral proliferation indirectly, by suppressing activity of the host immune system and altering the host metabolic balance, both functions governed by glucocorticoids [10].",

Insulin uses the forkhead transcription factors (FoxOs) to control gene induction. Baseline, unphosphorylated FoxOs are active, reside in the nucleus and bind to their responsive sequences in the promoter region of insulin-responsive genes. By contrast, insulin activates Akt kinase, which phosphorylates specific serine and threonine residues in FoxOs to render them inactive [39]. Indeed, once FoxOs are phosphorylated at specific residues, they lose their transcriptional activity, by binding to and translocating into the cytoplasm with proteins of the 14\u20133-3 family [39]. We have found that Vpr moderately inhibits insulin-induced translocation of FoxO3a into the cytoplasm through inhibiting its association with 14\u20133-3 [37]. Based on these in vitro findings, Vpr might be a key viral factor that induces lipodystrophy, insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia by interfering with and/or modulating cellular activities, such as transactivation of NRs and insulin [26].",

The primary abnormality of this disease resides in the osteoclasts, which demonstrate increased capacity for bone resorption and hypersensitivity to vitamin D [40]. Immunocytochemical studies have shown that osteoclasts from patients with Paget's disease of bone contain paramyxoviral-like nuclear inclusions that cross-react with antibodies to measles virus, respiratory syncytial virus and canine distemper virus nucleocapsid antigen [40]. Nucleocapsid transcripts of measles virus (MVNP), the negative single-strand RNA virus of the Paramyxoviridae family, have also been detected in osteoclasts from patients with Paget's disease of bone [41]. Indeed, forced expression of MVNP in normal osteoclast precursor cells enhances formation of mature osteoclasts that possess many characteristics of those in patients with Paget's disease, including increased sensitivity to vitamin D [40]. Transgenic expression of MVNP induces bone lesions similar to those found in Paget's disease [42]. Osteoclasts that express MVNP demonstrate increased levels of TAFII-17, which is one of the components of the general transcriptional complexes that are attracted to the ligand-activated vitamin D receptor [40]. Thus, it is possible that Paget's disease of bone might be caused, in part, by the measles virus, through its encoded molecule MVNP increasing the sensitivity of osteoclasts to vitamin D.",

The causative virus of this severe respiratory syndrome is the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a positive single-strand RNA virus of the Coronaviridae family [47].

Although it functions as a carboxypeptidase similar to ACE, it has different substrate specificity: ACE2 cleaves a single residue from angiotensin I (ANG I) and ANG II to generate the inactive forms angiotensin (1\u20139) and angiotensin (1\u20137), respectively, whereas ACE removes dipeptides from the C-terminus of ANG I to produce potent, bioactive ANG II (Figure 4\n) [51].",

ANG II is a potent stimulator of vascular constriction, Na+ uptake in the renal tubules, aldosterone secretion from the adrenal glands and vasopressin secretion from the pituitary gland [53]. ANG II also has important roles in lung physiology and pathophysiology [51]. Indeed, ACE and ANG II function as promoting factors for acute lung injury, whereas ACE2 protects against lung injury [51]. As SARS-CoV infection downregulates ACE2 expression markedly in the lung and reduces circulating concentrations of ANG II [54], it is likely that SARS-CoV contributes to severe lung disease and other systemic complications through dysregulation of the renin\u2212angiotensin system. This is in contrast to other coronaviruses that infect the lung epithelium like SARS-CoV but cause much milder diseases [51].",

However, some viruses are resistant to vaccine development by conventional approaches. For example, so far, anti-HIV-1 vaccines have not been sufficiently effective to protect from infection by this virus, despite the tremendous efforts of the scientific community.

Expansion of our understanding of virus-induced modifications of the host signaling systems, such as those discussed above, might prove highly beneficial for the development of new vaccines and novel anti-viral agents, based on knowledge of the potential indispensability of specific viral molecules for the entry, replication, and intracellular and extracellular survival and propagation of these viruses. Indeed, this approach has been followed successfully in the development of nucleoside analogs, such as acyclovir for the herpes simplex virus and ganciclovir for Cytomegalovirus, which specifically block transcription promoted by virus-encoded and virus-specific DNA polymerases [57]. Oseltamivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor that blocks the influenza virus-encoded neuraminidase, is effective in controlling infection by blocking the release of newly replicated viruses from the infected cells, a step in which this enzyme has a major role [58]. Thus, either vaccines or chemical compounds, including nucleotides (e.g. antisense DNA and siRNA) that inhibit the expression and/or function of specific viral molecules, are promising approaches for the treatment of viral illnesses. Indeed, vaccines against HIV-1 Tat are under development with promising effects [59]. We envision that future research to further elucidate the effects of viral molecules on the host endocrine signaling systems will improve our ability to intercept viral infection and prevent virus infection-associated diseases that affect endocrine systems. and endocrine target organs.",

Binding sites of p160 NR coactivators and Vpr overlap, and both bind NRs and p300 or CBP. Thus, Vpr mimics the host p160 NR coactivators and enhances NR transcriptional activity. p300/CBP facilitates attraction of transcription factors, cofactors and general transcription complexes by loosening the histone\u2013DNA interaction through acetylation of histone tails by its HAT domain.
