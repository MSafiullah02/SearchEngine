There are few studies of the use of dashboards to improve professional practice in anesthesiology. The objective of the present study was to describe the user-centered development, implementation and preliminary evaluation of clinical dashboards dealing with anesthesia unit management and quality assessment in a French university medical center. User needs and technical requirements were identified in end user interviews and then synthesized. Several representations were then developed (according to good visualization practice) and submitted to end users for appraisal. Lastly, dashboards were implemented and made accessible for everyday use via the medical center's network. After a period of use, end user feedback on the dashboard platform was collected as a system usability score (range 0 to 100). Seventeen themes (corresponding to 29 questions and 42 indicators) were identified. After prioritization and feasibility assessment, 10 dashboards were ultimately implemented and deployed. The dashboards variously addressed the unit's overall activity, compliance with guidelines on intraoperative hemodynamics, ventilation and monitoring, and documentation of the anesthesia procedure. The mean (standard deviation) system usability score was 82.6 (11.5), which corresponded to excellent usability. We developed clinical dashboards for a university medical center's anesthesia units. The dashboards' deployment was well received by the center's anesthesiologists. The dashboards' impact on activity and practice after several months of use will now have to be assessed.",

When applied to data, visual analytics techniques produce dashboards, among other visual analysis tools [2] . A dashboard is defined as a single-screen visual representation of data from several sources. Graphical displays and tables are used to display qualitative and quantitative indicators. The most relevant information on a dashboard has to be assimilated by managers in a single glance, with a view to improving the decisionmaking process [3, 4] . Over the last 10 years, dashboard technologies have been deployed widely in the field of healthcare [5] . Clinical dashboards enable easy access to several sources of data on a large number of patients, after aggregation and synthesis into concise, usable indicators. Furthermore, clinical dashboards are intended to provide clinicians with feedback on their practices and thus enable improvements in the quality of patient care [6, 7] .",

The Medical Center's Department of Anesthesia is supported by a data warehouse [29] [30] [31] fed with data from the AIMS and a billing application (diagnoses, medical procedures, hospital stays, death, etc.). The data warehouse also frequently supplies data for retrospective clinical studies.

Afterwards, we asked the interviewees to rate the dashboard's ease of use, its accessibility, its practical suitability, and whether it matched their needs. At the end of the interview, the interviewees were asked to rate the system usability scale (SUS) score [38, 39] . The 10-item SUS questionnaire provides an overview of subjective assessments of usability. For each item, the score is rated on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (\"strongly disagree\") to 5 (\"strongly agree\"). The final scores for items 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 were equal to the respondee's Likert scale score minus 1, whereas the final scores for items 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 were equal to 5 minus the respondee's Likert scale score. To obtain the overall SUS score, the item scores were added and then multiplied by 2.5. To obtain the overall SUS score, the item scores were added and then multiplied by 2.5; the higher the SUS score, the more usable the dashboard. Fig. 1 Raw data from the AIMS and billing software were integrated in a data warehouse. An aggregation step produced suitable aggregated tables for each dashboard.

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, there are very few publication on the development of clinical dashboards for managing units and improving quality in anesthesiology [24] [25] [26] [27] . By developing clinical dashboards for mechanical ventilation and blood pressure control, the present research is part of Lille University Medical Center's current effort to improve intraoperative management. Specifically, in reference to current guidelines and recent literature, key indicators identified by end-users included the incidence of hypotension [40] , ventilatory settings and related monitored variables (particularly driving pressure) [41] , fluid administration [42] and blood transfusion [43] . Interestingly, there is significant potential for improvement in compliance with current recommendations of good practice, as they are based on relatively recent studies. Figure 2 shows that the practice of using small tidal volumes and PEEP, which is the basis of protective lung ventilation [41] , has consistently increased over the past few years in our hospital. Thus, the dashboards will allow each anesthesia staff to monitor its own practice along time. Moreover, by providing data on postoperative complications, the dashboards will allow to directly assess the impact of any practice change on postoperative outcome. Finally, since the impact of practice changes likely depends on patient and/or surgical risk factors [44] , our dashboards will allow for prioritization of different goals across operating rooms [for example, the primary focus will be on ventilatory endpoints in abdominal or thoracic surgery (high risk of respiratory complications), and instead on mean arterial pressure in neurosurgery (low blood pressure can promote cerebral ischemia and increase intracranial pressure)].",

Section 1 features the dashboard's name, information about data availability, and print button. Section 2 offers settings for selecting the medical unit and the time period displayed. Section 3 is a summary table. Section 4 is the main part of the dashboard, with all the charts when developing this tool, in order to guarantee usability and ensure that the information displayed did not lead to misunderstandings or interpretation errors. This approach is in line with current guidelines on developing health information technology and medical devices [45] . Although the present development process involved anesthesiologists, this tool could also be used by residents, nurses, surgeons, and healthcare managers. During the design process, the end users' lack of knowledge about this type of technology limited the number of proposals; indeed, the clinical staff were not used to having access to aggregated data (except for the individual patient follow-up). Moreover, they were not familiar with designing graphics themselves. After the dashboards had been released, the staff became more familiar with the tool and thus were more likely to suggest new themes that could be addressed with the help of dashboards.",

To this end, we will use a set of usability heuristics adapted to the visualization of dashboards [46] to evaluate and improve their usability. Besides, the acceptability of the dashboard by clinicians and units' heads will be assessed through a questionnaire inspired by the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology [47] . In subsequent work, we intend to assess the dashboards' mediumterm acceptability with anesthetists and other healthcare professionals. After a few months of use, a further round of development might be useful for adapting the existing dashboards and generating new ones that address novel themes and issues and are applicable to other medical specialties. The integration of new data sources could also be considered. On the clinical front, we will have to evaluate the impact of dashboards on activity, practices and endpoints, such as patient outcomes [48] . In this sense, a dashboard could be considered to be an audit tool [49] ; it will also be important to establish how dashboards might (i) help clinicians to become more aware of their practice and habits, (ii) change the clinicians' representations of their activities, and (iii) assist with the decision-making process. For example, the discovery and appropriation of indicators by clinicians will help them to define targets, according to the context of their service and the recommendations of learned societies.",
