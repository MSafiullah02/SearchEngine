The accumulation of collagen-rich extra cellular matrix (ECM), damage of alveolar wall and loss of functional capillary units can lead to respiratory failure within a few years followed diagnostic confirmation (Giri, 2003). Patients suffering from chronic diseases as well as acute damages, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), may develop typical PF, and most patients eventually die (Cheung et al., 2004). Based on published reports, the estimated incidence of PF was 0.25\u2030 in USA and 0.07\u20130.18\u2030 in European countries during 1990s, and estimated cost of healthcare was about US$ 40,707 per patient (Raghu et al., 2004).",

            "text": "PF can result from many endogenous or exogenous causes, such as infection, chemical poisoning, radiation, etc. Bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis (BLMPF) in rats has been widely used as a model to investigate the pathology of PF (Giri, 2003). In recent years, a number of studies showed significant up-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) and transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) in the lung tissue of BLMPF rats that resembled clinical findings in PF patients (Khalil et al., 1993, Gurujeyalakshmi et al., 2000, Coker et al., 2001, Romanska et al., 2002). These similarities suggest that the active iNOS in inflammatory cells is responsible for excessive formation of nitric oxide (NO), and is involved in pulmonary injury (Hobbs et al., 1999). Meanwhile, these results further suggest that TGF-\u03b21 derived from fibroblasts is one of the key cytokines in fibrogenetic phase of PF, and may result in collagen overproduction and deposition in lungs (Coker et al., 2001). These two factors play important roles during the PF induced by bleomycin, and therefore have been regarded as pathological markers in researches and as potential therapeutic targets in treatments (Hobbs et al., 1999, Flanders and Burmester, 2003).",

            "text": "It is well known that PF is hard to treat clinically and few medications successfully relieve the condition. Corticosteroid therapy is the first-line choice to prevent and treat this disease (American Thoracic Society, 2000). Laboratory studies showed that corticosteroids might prevent the collagen over-expression (Dik et al., 2003) and might decrease up-regulated cytokines including TGF-\u03b21 in BLMPF models (Khalil et al., 1993). In other studies, corticosteroids might inhibit iNOS over-expression during acute cardiac allograft rejection, although this effect has not been reported in PF (Worrall et al., 1996). Since unacceptable adverse effects are associated with corticosteroid treatments, searching for more effective and safer therapies has been one of the hot topics in this field. In recent years, it has been reported that curcumin, a botanical compound with anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-tumor effects, can ameliorate adverse pathological changes in BLMPF models (Venkatesan et al., 1997, Punithavathi et al., 2000), and thus appears to be a potentially valuable treatment for PF.",

Whiles NO may stimulate transcription factor nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) to promote TGF-\u03b21 gene expression and consequently increase TGF-\u03b21 production (Gossart et al., 1996). Thus, it was postulated that a regulatory network including iNOS and TGF-\u03b21 may be involved in the development of pulmonary fibrosis. Although an abnormal increase of iNOS in lung tissue may peak on the 5th day after bleomycin injection (Gurujeyalakshmi et al., 2000), we found that pulmonary expressions of both iNOS protein and mRNA on the 28th day were 146 and 523% higher in BLMPF rats than that in normal rats. These abnormal iNOS levels indicated that an inflammatory injury existed in the lungs of experimental rats to the end of our experiments. Meanwhile, the over-expressions of both protein and mRNA of pulmonary TGF-\u03b21 were shown on the 28th day in BLMPF rats. TGF-\u03b21 may be another important causative factor, and play a key role during the process of pulmonary fibrosis by increasing the synthesis and secretion of ECM protein through stimulation of its gene transcription, and by decreasing degradation of ECM through inhibition of secretion of protein kinases (Robert et al., 1990). It is well known that the Col-I expression is regulated by TGF-\u03b21; therefore, depressing over-expression of iNOS and TGF-\u03b21 may inhibit Col-I increase and collagen synthesis, and should be important therapeutic targets in preventing PF.",

Furthermore, a parallel down-regulation of Col-I, iNOS and TGF-\u03b21 at both protein and mRNA levels after hydrocortisone treatment suggests that the amelioration of Col-I may at least partly result from inhibition of iNOS expression and consequent decrease of TGF-\u03b21 expression.",

Curcumin may inhibit the DNA-binding activity of activator protein-1 (AP-1), then inhibit T\u03b2R II as AP-1 binding sites located in T\u03b2R II promoters (Gaedeke et al., 2004, Xu et al., 1997\u20131998), therefore it is reasonable to presume that the down-regulation of TGF-\u03b21 after curcumin administration, as in our current study, may involve T\u03b2R II reduction, and partly result from curcumin's suppression of AP-1 activation.

The dose and duration of hydrocortisone designed for this study may have been too low and too short to display its toxicity. It has been reported that administration of curcumin at 500 mg/kg/day continually for 80 days did not produce any adverse effect in rats (Wo et al., 2000). Our data confirmed that this dose was safe for rats in a 28-day treatment. Even so, a daily dose of 250 mg/kg should be recommended for future studies as its pharmacodynamic effects in prevention of BLMPF were similar to the daily dose of 500 mg/kg.",

Our data indicated that curcumin possesses therapeutic effects comparable to hydrocortisone in treating BLMPF rats. Oral administration of curcumin at a daily dose of both 500 mg/kg and 250 mg/kg significantly inhibited bleomycin-induced over-expressions of Col-I, iNOS and TGF-\u03b21 at transcriptional and translational levels, and reduced pulmonary inflammatory injury and fibrosis. There was no significant difference between treatments with these two dosages. Curcumin, widely used as a food additive, did not show any adverse effect in our study. Therefore, it could be a valuable herbal component for PF treatment.",

Telangiectasis, hyperemia and thrombogenesis were also found in the alveolar wall (B).
