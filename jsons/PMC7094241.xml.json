            "text": "\nThere have been three major influenza pandemics in the 20th century: the \u201cSpanish Flu\u201d (Influenza H1N1) in 1918, the \u201cAsian Flu\u201d (H2N2) in 1957, and the \u201cHong Kong Flu\u201d (H3N2) in 1968.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 The latter two pandemics resulted in estimated worldwide deaths of 2 million in 1957 and 1 million in 1968. Although estimates vary on the total number of deaths credited with these pandemics, most agree that at least 50 million died from the Spanish Flu between 1918 and 1919, with deaths predominantly occurring within a few days of infection.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11 And, of all the deaths from the 1918 pandemic, over half the dead were young, healthy adults, an uncommon phenomenon with seasonal flu illness. Scientists concluded that origins of the strains of influenza virus causing the 3 pandemics were viruses containing combinations of genes from both a human influenza virus and an avian influenza virus.1, 4, 6, 7, 8 As an aside, in this era of bioterrorism preparedness, it is important to note that the reassortment of influenza genes could be employed for the creation of biological weapons.13, 14 Avian influenza therefore represents a likely pathogen to cause the next pandemic, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC). WHO issued a report in December 2004 in which the threat of an influenza pandemic occurring in the near future has greater likelihood with the recent appearance and wide spread of avian influenza H5N1.5 A pandemic is generally considered to be a global outbreak, ie, a pathogen that causes a multi-continent epidemic. H5N1 meets that criterion if you consider birds, given chickens, geese, pigeons, and other fowl have been afflicted from Asia to Europe. There have been several thousand outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry from 2003 to April 2007 worldwide, with most occurring in Vietnam (2,373) and Thailand (1,137), and the fewest in France, Germany, Jordan, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Kazakhstan, Djibouti, Cameroon, and Saudi Arabia each with 1 confirmed outbreak (Fig 2). WHO warns that the next influenza pandemic could result in the deaths of between 2 and 7 million people, with tens of millions requiring hospitalization, including treatment in intensive care units.11 This is a WHO \u201cbest case\u201d scenario, modeled after the \u201cmilder\u201d pandemics in the 20th century. WHO considers the pandemic of 1918 to be \u201cextraordinary\u201d and thus have chosen to model the 1957/1968 outbreaks. However, if one were to model the potential impact HPAI H5N1 could have if it were to become the causative agent of a pandemic, based on the 1918 pandemic, the death toll expected would be exponentially greater than the more conservative estimates given above.11 What makes the WHO 2004 report especially prescient, not long after it was published, in 2005, there occurred a significant increase in the spread of the avian influenza strain H5N1, resulting in millions of birds and hundreds of humans subsequently being affected (Table 1\nand Fig 3).\n15 Sporadic outbreaks of avian influenza continue to date with the most recent being in Egypt where several people have become infected and subsequently died.",

In 1997 several individuals became infected with what was soon to be recognized as a deadly emerging strain of avian influenza, H5N1, that was increasingly being associated with diseased chickens, resulting in the almost total destruction of Hong Kong poultry flocks.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 Hong Kong, a British Crown Colony, enjoyed the financial and public health infrastructure that is credited with limiting the spread of avian influenza in 1997. Realizing the safety of Hong Kong, and potentially the region relied on poultry farmers being forthcoming with information about sick birds, with the full knowledge that the best way to contain the threat was to kill a farmers entire flock\u2014something that poses an enormous burden to local communities\u2014the government provided financial support to minimize the impact. As a result, widespread, intentional culling allowed the attenuation of the infection.17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25\n",

Unlike British procedures which halted the spread in 1997, Chinese government activities resulted in delayed culling of chickens, as well as delayed or nonpayment to farmers when their flocks were destroyed; these have all been suspected as contributing to the reemergence and spread of HPAI.34 Efforts by WHO, global reporting by numerous media organizations, and the collective cooperation and leadership among most of the Asian nations affected have contributed to vastly improved surveillance, laboratory capabilities, medical response, vaccine development, and other containment strategies.34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41 It is worth remembering, we all live in a global world.

Influenza A virus is a negative sense, single-stranded RNA virus, with an 8-segment genome that encodes for 10 proteins17, 20, 28 (Fig 2). They are further classified or sub-typed based on two surface proteins: haemagglutinin (H) which attaches the viral particle to the host cell for cell entry, and neuraminidase (N) which facilitates the spread of progeny virus. It is the latter which is a target for the class of antiviral therapy referred to as neuraminidase inhibitors.1, 2, 18, 22, 26, 28, 29 There are 16 H and 9 N subtypes making up all the subtypes of influenza A by various combinations.27\n",

Because influenza has a segmented genome, shuffling of gene segments can occur if two different subtypes of influenza A virus co-infect the same cell. Conditions favorable for the emergence of antigenic shift have long been thought to involve humans living in proximity to farm animals, namely poultry and pigs. Pigs are susceptible to infection with both avian and mammalian virus. If a human influenza virus, such as H3N2, and an avian H5N1 virus co-infect a human or pig, it is possible a new virus H5N2 could emerge\u2014a hybrid that could combine the high virulence of H5N1 with the efficiency of human to human transmission found in the \u201cparent\u201d human virus.19, 31\n",

            "text": "Avian influenza is an infectious disease of birds caused by influenza virus type A strains occurring worldwide. Avian influenza was first identified over 100 years ago in Italy.1 In 1955 studies revealed that all subtypes of influenza A viruses have been detected in more than 90 species of otherwise apparently healthy wild birds.1, 2, 8 The natural reservoir of avian influenza viruses are wild waterfowl, gulls, and shorebirds. Usually the gastrointestinal tract is involved, thus the risk of exposure when coming in contact with excreta. Historically, it is likely that these species of birds have carried avian influenza viruses without developing symptoms; such is an optimal condition of adaptation, especially virus to host. Given these birds are migratory, ie, highly mobile, they are known to carry viruses over great distances. These birds can excrete significant viral loads in their feces, yet remain healthy. Until recently, avian influenza viruses have been considered relatively nondangerous to birds and extremely rare findings in humans. When these infections did occur in humans, only mild illness occurred, usually conjunctivitis followed by full recovery. H5N1 has proven dramatically to be an exception, causing death to animals and humans. Of note, given that H5N1 is killing animals that normally are not affected by avian influenza viruses, this suggests that the virus has adapted and thus increased its virulence (a virus\u2019 capacity to harm or kill). Since infected birds will excrete the virus, such commonness of bird feces promotes contamination of food, water, environment, and other animals, increasing the likelihood of human illness.2 The majority of the infections were the result of human to animal proximity in mostly agricultural countries with often substandard hygienic practices. It is thus easy to understand why environment and cultural cooking practices are of paramount concern. Eating raw eggs, poultry blood, or undercooked bird meat, playing \u201ccatch\u201d with chicken heads, and domiciles shared with animals have been the primary routes of contamination for infected people.2\n",

A total of 15 subtypes of influenza are known to infect birds, resulting in an extensive reservoir; this poses a significant challenge to governments and international public health efforts to contain an infection that can literally travel on the very winds the birds can fly! Of additional concern, low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) can mutate into HPAI. An example of this was the H5N2 virus that circulated in the United States in 1983 to 1984. It began as an LPAI with a low mortality rate, but within 6 months it became an HPAI associated with a 90% mortality rate. Italy experienced a similar event; an H7N1 LPAI virus mutated within 9 months into an HPAI form, resulting in the death\u2014disease or culling\u2014of greater than 13 million birds.1, 8, 9\n",

Fortunately people cannot get avian influenza from eating properly cooked poultry. Eating raw eggs, poultry blood, or undercooked bird meat are ways that one could become infected and are practices in countries where human avian influenza cases have been recorded.2, 17, 20\n",

Yet it is likely that 911 will be activated to send an ambulance to an acutely ill victim of avian influenza. In a recent online survey conducted by the Journal of Emergency Medical Services (JEMS), readers, most of whom are medics, emergency physicians, and EMS administrators, were asked if their EMS agency had a plan for operations during a pandemic flu outbreak, including stockpiles of N-95 masks. Only 17% of total respondents answered \u201cyes,\u201d whereas the majority stated \u201cno\u201d because they were focusing on other planning initiatives.52 This relative lack of preparedness may reflect lack of funding, inadequate training, or disenfranchisement from public health efforts. It is also just as likely that a community clinician may be called on to diagnose the sentinel case of avian flu in the United States, reminiscent of the diagnosis of the index case of inhalation anthrax in 2001.2 Most scenarios describe a significant number of people becoming quite ill over a relatively short period of time. It is important to realize that a sick individual may precede such an outbreak, underscoring the critical importance of providing advanced training to physicians in the recognition or suspicion of emerging pathogens, given that early diagnosis can save a life and alert the medical community of a developing threat.33, 53, 54, 55, 56 In a global world, anything from deadly animals used for exotic pets to infectious diseases can be imported.57, 58, 59, 60, 61 Primary care clinicians should be aware of these risks and convey information about them to their patients.",

The fever spike is \u226538\u00b0C or \u2265101\u00b0F and often >39\u00b0C. Nearly universal is dyspnea. Significant difficulty breathing early in the illness warrants aggressive intervention.2, 10, 17, 18, 20, 23, 25 However, the early absence of severe respiratory symptoms in the presence of risk factors and other symptoms consistent with avian influenza does not rule out the illness; pulmonary involvement can develop rapidly, and the astute clinician should be alert to respiratory changes. As noted earlier, avian influenza is capable of direct pulmonary injury to any age group, including young healthy adults, resulting in a variety of manifestations on chest radiographs, respiratory and fluid derangements, unlike seasonal influenza which causes severe illness or death usually as a result in secondary bacterial pneumonia that tends to be limited to immunocompromised, elderly, very young, or ill patients.66 It is worth noting that other family members or coworkers may manifest similar symptoms with varying degrees of severity and development of illness.",

Whether influenza season or as a result of WHO or CDC alerts that additional avian flu cases are occurring, it is important to train intake personnel, receptionists, and triage nurses about key questions and symptoms to look for in order to rapidly implement infection control measures and alert appropriate personnel to diagnose and manage potential contagious patients. Laboratory testing may be helpful to confirm H5N1 but should not delay initiation of infection control or other critical interventions.",

Radiographic investigation; usually a chest x-ray is an appropriate study especially in the setting of a potential avian influenza patient. Again, exercise precautions including infection control measures including PPE, communicating concerns about potential contagious illness to health care team, laboratory personnel, and testing technicians. Major findings on chest radiograph (CXR) associated with H5N1 include extensive infiltration bilaterally, lobar collapse, focal consolidation, and less commonly interstitial lung infiltrates (Fig 5). Experts at the University of Oxford have studied 98 chest x-rays of 14 patients admitted to Ho Chi Minh City Hospital in Vietnam after testing positive for avian influenza.77 Of the 14 patients studied, 9 died and 5 survived. The most common abnormality found was multifocal consolidation, considered representative of pus and infection. They further suggested that the findings were similar to chest x-rays seen in SARS patients: multiple accumulations. They also found enlarged lymph nodes, cavities forming in the lung tissue, and fluid in the space surrounding the lungs, not usually associated with SARS CXR. The researchers suggest that the severity of chest x-rays may be a good predictor of prognosis; clinical deterioration associated with these is common.2, 19, 20, 22, 25, 27, 77\n",

Detection of H5N1 is more likely from specimens collected within 3 days of illness onset. Appropriate precautions should be taken including gloves, gown, goggles, and fit tested respirator when obtaining BAL; it should be noted it is an aerosol-generating procedure. When using swabs to obtain specimens, make certain that they have a Dacron\u00ae top on an aluminum or plastic shaft.",

This test can provide preliminary results on suspected H5 Influenza samples within 4 hours once sample testing begins at the lab. This is a major advance given previous technology required 2 to 3 days for similar results. If the H5 strain is identified, further testing is conducted to determine the specific subtype such as N1, etc. The test will be distributed nationwide to LRN designated laboratories in order to enhance surveillance and diagnostic capabilities. There are approximately 140 LRN laboratories throughout the United States. The CDC recommends if a clinician suspects a patient may be infected with avian influenza, it is important to contact the local or state health department for assistance in accessing the LRN capabilities.31 It cannot be overemphasized that clinical findings and history of exposure may be the most helpful in the early, albeit presumptive identification of patients with H5N1.1, 2, 10, 19, 20, 21, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31\n",

            "text": "To date the most important route of acquisition for H5N1 infection is through contact with infected birds or their excreta. However, hospital-acquired infection was also demonstrated in a retrospective study. Healthcare workers (HCW) exposed to patients with H5N1 infection were more likely to be seropositive, and this was not attributable to animal exposure.2, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 51, 55, 70, 72, 83 It is reasonable to assume that the route of infection for avian influenza patients, like most influenza patients, can be from inhalation of infective respiratory secretions and/or contact with virus-laden secretions and subsequent transference contact with mucous membranes (Fig 6).\n33, 83 Studies suggest that airborne transmission of influenza is possible, which would explain the sometimes numerically explosive nature of flu epidemics.2, 66, 70, 72, 73, 83 Although the true epidemiology is unknown, it is possible that there is asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infection by H5N1; perhaps patients presenting for care are representative of the most severely infected. The actual transmission rate per person is unknown; the basic reproductive number for influenza (the number of secondary cases produced by one primary case) varies from 1.68 to 20. Viral shedding starts within 24 hours before the onset of symptoms and peaks within 48 hours afterwards.2, 45, 12, 48, 65, 70, 72, 84 Therefore, CDC recommends treating potential H5N1 patients as a contagion risk: respiratory/airborne precautions in addition to droplet, contact, and standard precautions as infection control practices for HCW and healthcare facilities.2, 22, 31, 32, 33, 49, 85 Although H5N1 is inefficient at person-to-person transmission, it is likely to acquire this capability in the advent of a pandemic.2, 19, 22, 23 Although not studied fully in all populations, the period of communicability of H5N1 can last for up to 3 weeks in children.",

Both classes can treat influenza viruses. However, the present circulating H5N1 genotype \u201cZ\u201d confers a residue on the M2 protein, making this avian flu intrinsically resistant to the M blockers.2, 17, 19, 31 The neuraminidase inhibitors remain effective against seasonal and avian influenza but should be administered early, ideally within 48 hours of illness onset.2, 12, 18, 20, 21, 22, 31, 32, 33, 43, 44 Oseltamivir when administered for seasonal influenza is usually given at a dosage of 75 mg by mouth twice daily for 5 days. A higher dose, 150 mg orally given twice daily, has been recommended in clinical trials and associated with a larger reduction in viral load and shorter duration of illness. Whether a higher dose given over a longer duration would confer benefit in avian influenza remains to be further evaluated but should be considered in patients with significant pulmonary and GI symptoms. Children older than 1 year of age can receive twice daily oral dosing based on weight: 30 mg per dose if 15 kg or less, 45 mg if 15\u201323 kg, 60 mg for 23\u201340 kg, and 75 mg for those over 40 kg.

Although rare, transmission of vaccine viruses via LAIV to close contacts has been reported. Side effects associated with LAIV are usually mild and include runny nose and headache.

It is intended for adults 18-64 years of age who could be at increased risk of exposure to H5N1. Clinical testing involved 103 healthy adults. The vaccine was well tolerated with side effects similar to other injected immunizations: pain at the injection site and headache. In addition, some patients complained of general ill feeling and muscle pain. Additional information is being collected on safety and effectiveness in other age groups and is expected to be reported to the FDA in the near future. The vaccine immunization consists of 2 intramuscular injections given 1 month apart. The vaccine will not be available commercially; it was purchased by the US Government to be included in the National Stockpile. The vaccine will be distributed by public health officials if needed.31, 94\n",

MF 59 could boost the body\u2019s immune response to the vaccine\u2019s active constituent. WHO collaborating centers and reference labs have developed several H5N1 prototype vaccine strains, including A/Vietnam/1194/04, A/Vietnam/12030/04, and A/Hongkong/213/03 according to the requirements of pharmaceutical companies for possible vaccine production. WHO will make prototype strains available to vaccine manufacturers, as part of a global effort to develop and ultimately provide adequate supplies to even the most economically disadvantaged nations.97 Supply and demand represent interrelated and interdependent market forces; the WHO, like CDC believes promoting seasonal vaccine use can increase manufacturing capacity for both seasonal and pandemic vaccines. Although this makes good business sense, encouraging wider use of vaccines is also a powerful medical intervention to reduce suffering from vaccine preventable diseases.",

The number of negative pressure rooms, intensive care units, and isolation capabilities varies widely across regions and healthcare centers. The world of competing demands and financial cut-backs is an omnipresent reality for healthcare professionals today. Yet the number of emerging pathogens, changes in virulence patterns among known infections such as tuberculosis (TB) evolving beyond simply being multidrug resistant towards extremely drug resistant TB (XDR TB) are today\u2019s reality. In the event of a SARS or avian influenza outbreak, we must be prepared to handle large numbers of potentially contagious patients (FIG 9, FIG 10).\nThis requires having a well thought out plan in place that utilizes input from all major stakeholders, has been practiced and buttressed by the knowledge that participants have appropriate tools to carry out the plan\u2014equipment, training, personnel, countermeasures (medicines)\u2014and are trained in the appropriate use of such materials. Having appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as n-95 respirators (Fig 11) isn\u2019t enough. Personnel must know how to wear PPE appropriately and select it according to the situation based on well-accepted guidelines.4, 5, 8, 9 Knowing how to cohort patients, convert space in the HCF to adapt to contagious patients, the number of avian or SARS patients or other type of deadly pathogen in greater than one or two patients, including professional expertise needed, equipment, and other countermeasures is critical in the interpandemic phase. Developing mutual aid agreements with HCF or organizations, perhaps in different regions, that may have greater resources or equipment, is one option to strengthening response capabilities. Realizing the continuum of care starts in the community, increased communications with prehospital professions; emergency medicine as well as community stakeholders can increase the likelihood that the response to a contagion can be managed effectively.",

How many people does a potentially contagious person have to go through in a healthcare facility or your office practice before being placed in a private area? The potential for spreading or receiving unwanted \u201cgerms\u201d is impressive from patient to patient (FIG 7, FIG 8). Therefore, preventive strategies should be implemented early. Given the high case fatality rate (CFR) of avian influenza as well as pneumonia in high-risk patients, a combination of contact, droplet, and airborne precautions are recommended. Whenever possible, separate well from sick patients in the waiting room.2, 53, 83, 99, 101, 102 Intake staff should use reception prompts that identify potentially contagious patients and place them into an exam room rapidly to cut down on waiting room times (FIG 7, FIG 8).4, 33, 48, 50, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103 Sanitizing gels, tissues, and disposable masks, as well as appropriate information about influenza and other timely materials should be available in your (frequently cleaned) waiting room. Whereas there is limited prospective research evaluating the practice of separating well from sick patients, emerging studies in aerobiology suggest the preventive measures practiced during the 1960s and 1970s whereupon pediatricians encouraged parents to bring sick kids with rashes and high fevers to the back door directly to an exam room instead of the general waiting room has merit99, 100, 101, 102 (Fig 8). Instances of measles transmission, not from direct contact but by the persistent virus left behind from an infected child, have been well documented.2, 83, 100 As an aside, it is worth noting that measles has not been eradicated. Measles kills an estimated 600,000 people worldwide annually; however, the actual number may be greater.106, 107 Cases and outbreaks can occur as a result of inadequate immunization within communities domestically and from foreign visitors who are ill. In the summer of 2006, a computer programmer from India arrived in Boston. Several days after he arrived, he developed symptoms of measles; soon thereafter several people became infected, causing the first such outbreak in Massachusetts since 1999.108 Most of the cases involved people in their 30s and 40s who were vaccinated in the 1960s with an ineffective vaccine. This episode underscores our vulnerability to global threats, especially if our patients are unvaccinated or inadequately vaccinated.",

Influenza and pneumonia remain responsible for 5.5% of the deaths of people 65 and older6, 40, 92 in 1997, with an increase in infection-related deaths among older persons from 1980 to 1992.109, 110, 111 And, the combined death rate from influenza and pneumonia for all age-race-sex groups has increased.110, 111 Evidence suggests hand hygiene can reduce healthcare-associated infection rates, whether using soap and water or waterless interventions including alcohol-based hand rubs. Failure to perform appropriate hand hygiene is a leading cause of healthcare-associated infections, the spread of multi-drug resistant organisms, and contributes to outbreaks.
