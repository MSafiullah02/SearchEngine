It is shed via both the respiratory tract and the faeces, and can persist in the birds and the intestinal tract for several weeks or months. Outdoors, survival of IBV for 56 days in litter has been reported (Cavanagh & Gelb, 2008) . Although strict biosecurity and working with a one-age system are essential control measures, vaccination is normally required to increase the resistance of the chickens against challenge with IBV strains. This is made more difficult to achieve because IBV exists in the form of many different antigenic or genotypic types, commonly referred to as variants. Being a coronavirus and therefore a singlestranded RNA virus, IBV has an enormous capacity to change both by spontaneous mutation and by genetic recombination (Cavanagh & Gelb, 2008) . When these events occur with IBV, both are most likely to result in the emergence of new variants if they occur in the hypervariable regions of the spike gene. Whilst many new variants are unable to replicate or survive for only a short time, a few emerge that become of economic importance either worldwide or in restricted geographic areas (see below).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 366, "end": 389, "text": "(Cavanagh & Gelb, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 909, "end": 932, "text": "(Cavanagh & Gelb, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The present paper presents an overview of the history and current situation of IBV worldwide, including the measures necessary to control the many infectious bronchitis (IB) variants found throughout the world.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "For many years it was widely believed that the first variants of IBVoccurred in the early 1950s when Jungherr et al.

Hofstad (1961 Hofstad ( , 1981 showed a poor level of cross-protection between several of them. New variants continued to be identified and poor cross-protection was shown (Gelb et al., 1981) . In a survey using a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for typing, Jackwood et al. (2005) identified 82 different IB variants among 1523 submissions to their laboratory over an 11-year period. As the number of variants identified in the USA increased, a few were shown to be both widely distributed and of major economic importance. Possibly the most significant of these was the variant known as Arkansas (Ark) (Fields, 1973) ; its importance quickly being recognized by the development of live-attenuated vaccines from this strain (Gelb & Cloud, 1983) . Vaccines developed from Mass, Conn and Ark IBVs are widely used in the USA, either singly or in combination (e.g. a combined Mass\u00c1Conn commercial product) and these vaccines have also proved beneficial in providing adequate cross-protection against other IB variants including California 99 , thereby indicating the possibility of cross-protection between IBVs. The Ark serotype continued to be of economic importance in the main poultry-producing areas, including Georgia and Delmarva . By the mid-1990s, the availability of molecular diagnostic methods led to the identification of subtypes or ''quasi-species'' within the Ark serotype (Nix et al., 2000; Jackwood et al., 2005) . However, suggestions that the currently available Ark vaccines were providing incomplete protection against more recent isolates of this serotype were discounted by Sander et al. (1997) , who demonstrated that poor protection was more likely to be due to poor vaccine application than to antigenic drift in the virus in the field.

DE072 increased in incidence throughout the next decade, also causing major disease problems in vaccinated flocks in Georgia (Lee et al., 2001) . It has apparently undergone both genetic drift and recombination (Lee & Jackwood, 2000 , such that DE072 vaccines provide only poor protection against field strains, and molecular analysis of field isolates has led to the recognition of a new IB variant, designated Georgia 98 (GA98) (Lee et al., 2001) .

In a study carried out in the mid-1990s, IBV isolates of at least five different antigenic types were found in commercial chickens of all types throughout Brazil, but mainly in the major poultry-producing area of the south (Di Fabio et al., 2000) . Several different genotypes have now been identified in Brazil by analysis of either the S1 gene (Montassier et al., 2006 (Montassier et al., , 2008 Villarreal et al., 2007a Villarreal et al., , 2007b or the nucleoprotein (N) gene (Abreu et al., 2006) , but protection studies have not been performed. More recently it has been shown (Villarreal et al., 2010) that both a unique cluster of IBV strains (subdivided into three subclusters) as well as the 4/91 genotype currently co-exist in that country. It is important to remember that in Brazil, as in many other parts of the world, the only live attenuated IB vaccines licensed for use are of the Mass serotype and that protection studies (Cook et al., 1999; Di Fabio et al., 2000) showed that the currently available Mass vaccine provided inadequate protection against some of the Brazilian variants. Hidalgo et al. (1976) reported the first isolation of IB (Mass serotype) in Chile in 1975 and variants were reported for the first time there some 10 years later (Hidalgo et al., 1986) . By the mid-1980s, IB was reported as a serious problem in commercial chicken flocks and novel variants as well as the Mass and Conn serotypes were isolated from broiler and layer flocks, and again Mass vaccines were found to protect poorly against challenge with these variants (Cubillos et al., 1991) . Elsewhere in Latin America a variant IBV was isolated from commercial chickens in Honduras in 1997 and poor protection against Mass vaccines was demonstrated (Cook et al., 1999) . Following the isolation of the Ark serotype in Mexico in the early 1990s (Quiroz et al., 1993) , the use of molecular methods subsequently identified IBV variants unique to that country in commercial chickens (Escorcia et al., 2000; Callison et al., 2001; Gelb et al., 2001) . They were shown by neutralization tests to be different from Mass or Conn serotypes, but in vivo protection studies were not performed. Rather surprisingly, IBV variants do not appear to have been reported in Argentina until very recently when Rimondi et al. (2009) , using only molecular techniques, detected three unique genotype clusters (in addition to Mass and Conn); one of these was closely related to isolates from Brazil. Similar techniques had been used a few years earlier to identify for the first time a genetically unique IB variant in Colombia (Alvarado et al., 2005) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 113, "end": 130, "text": "(Hip\u00f3 lito, 1957)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 230, "end": 256, "text": "(Branden & Da Silva, 1986)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 482, "end": 505, "text": "(Di Fabio et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 605, "end": 629, "text": "(Montassier et al., 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}, {"start": 630, "end": 656, "text": "(Montassier et al., , 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}, {"start": 657, "end": 681, "text": "Villarreal et al., 2007a", "ref_id": "BIBREF141"}, {"start": 682, "end": 708, "text": "Villarreal et al., , 2007b", "ref_id": "BIBREF142"}, {"start": 739, "end": 759, "text": "(Abreu et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 842, "end": 867, "text": "(Villarreal et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF143"}, {"start": 1199, "end": 1218, "text": "(Cook et al., 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1219, "end": 1241, "text": "Di Fabio et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1362, "end": 1383, "text": "Hidalgo et al.

However, recent data have suggested that the currently dominant IB variant in Taiwan may have arisen as a result of recombination in the 5? end of the N gene between a local IBV and a foreign IBV (Kuo et al., 2010) . The failure of Mass vaccines to provide adequate protection has led to the development of vaccines from indigenous strains (Huang & Wang, 2006) . For many years little was known of the situation regarding IBV variants in China, but the fact that Mass-type vaccines were used successfully suggests that variants may not have been a problem before the 1980s. However, by the mid-1990s this was clearly no longer the case and in the past decade many published reports have revealed the diversity of IBVs causing disease in that country. By means of in vivo studies and antigenic typing using monoclonal antibodies and cross-neutralization tests, Wu et al. (1998) identified highly pathogenic variant IBVs in China associated with both respiratory disease and nephritis and showed that H120 vaccine provided poor protection against challenge with these isolates. Possibly the most significant IBV variant worldwide to have emerged from China is the QX variant reported by YuDong et al. (1998) in association with proventriculitis (see above). Another IBV genotype Q1 has also been associated with proventriculitis (Yu et al., 2001a) . However, it remains unclear whether the problems with proventriculitis that were associated with the detection of QX or Q1 strains were really caused by the IBV infection or by another factor because local replication of the IBV strain in the proventriculis was not shown. In a recent study of 26 IBVs isolated between 1985 and 2008 from a variety of disease conditions in the Guangxi region of China, Wei et al. (2009) identified four clusters on the basis of RT-PCR analysis of the N gene. They were grouped into seven serotypes by neutralization tests, but there was poor correlation between the results of genotyping and serotyping. In an analysis of the genome of 26 IB variants isolated from the kidneys, proventriculus and oviduct in different areas of China between 1995 , Liu et al. (2006 identified Mass type IBVs plus five genotypes apparently found only in China and cocirculating there. One of these (genotype A2) was subsequently shown to be the dominant indigenous type in China at that time (Liu et al., 2009b) , although more recently, based on analysis of S1 gene sequences, Zou et al. (2010) have reported that a different genotype, designated LX4, is now dominant. Others showed close relationships with either Korean or Taiwanese IBV variants, and one was closely related to an Australian isolate (Liu et al., 2006) . Cuiping et al.

The extent of nucleotide identity between the strains was expressed on nucleotide level as follows: score 100% when all four strains had the same nucleobase (in the copy DNA); score 75% when three out of four strains had the same nucleobase; score 50% when two strains had the same nucleobase and the two other strains had another nucleobase in common; score 25% when two strains had the same nucleobase and the two other strains each had another different nucleobase; and score 0% when all strains had a different nucleobase at that position of the genome. In this comparison, a missing nucleotide (by deletion) was considered to be a different nucleobase. Table 1 shows the overview of the comparison. When windows of 10 nucleotides were used for the comparison of the four strains, the average homology of the four strains could have been 42.5% but also 100% based on the location of the 10 nucleotides that have been used for the comparison. When windows of 100 nucleotides were used for the comparison of the four strains, the average homology of the four strains could have been 68.0% but also 86.8% based on the location of the 100 nucleotides that were used for the comparison.
