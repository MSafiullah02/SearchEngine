Occupational rhinitis results from airborne particles in the workplace and is a response to allergic and nonallergic mechanisms.\u2022Mild disease can usually be managed with avoidance measures alone. Allergen removal can also improve the severity of allergic rhinitis and can reduce the need for medications. Pollen, dust mites, animals, insect proteins, and fungi are the most prominent allergic triggers. Environmental control may take weeks to months to produce full beneficial effects, and complete avoidance of allergen is usually not feasible or practical.\u2022Allergic rhinitis is represented by sneezing, nasal congestion, nasal pruritus, and rhinorrhea. When allergic disease is suspected, a skin prick test can be performed for confirmation. When skin testing is difficult to interpret or not feasible (ie, dermatographism), allergen-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) E serum testing based on the patient\u2019s history can be useful. The specific in vitro assays chosen should be based on local prevalence of aeroallergens.\u2022Oral antihistamines should be used to treat patients with mild or occasional seasonal allergic rhinitis. Cromolyn is an alternative to oral antihistamines in mild disease.\u2022The pathophysiology of nonallergic rhinitis does not involve IgE mediation. The specific mechanism is poorly understood because of the many presentations of the conditions in this category. What is known about the pathophysiology is that the nonallergic rhinitis is caused by nasal hyperactivity to nonimmunologic stimuli, but little is known regarding the exact mechanism of this nasal hyperactivity.\u2022Because of the variance in causes of nonallergic rhinitis, treatments also vary. Vasomotor rhinitis, nonallergic rhinitis with eosinophil syndrome, and rhinitis medicamentosa are best treated with intranasal corticosteroids. Irrigation and debridement are the standard treatment of atrophic rhinitis, with an occasional course of antibiotics if needed for acute infection. For gustatory rhinitis, pretreatment with ipratropium bromide can be used.\n\n",

Also associated with cocaine use. Patients have rebound congestion.\u2022Occupational rhinitis: symptoms from irritating chemicals, grain dust, laboratory animal antigens, wood, ozone. May coexist with occupational asthma.\u2022Hormonal rhinitis: rhinitis related to pregnancy or the menstrual cycle. Symptoms resolve 2 weeks after delivery. Sinusitis is 6 times more common in pregnancy.\u2022Drug-induced rhinitis: associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, phosphodiesterase-5 selective inhibitors, alpha receptor antagonists, phentolamine.\u2022Atrophic rhinitis: caused by glandular cell atrophy.
