In addition to their use in agriculture, OP are also used in both domestic and industrial settings and in public health applications, such as the control of mosquito-borne diseases [1]. The illegal use of poisoned baits containing OP has also been reported [2]. This group of pesticides has been reported to be a risk factor in respect of biodiversity and terrestrial ecosystems [3], causing contamination and being toxic to animal and human life. Furthermore, in countries where regulations are not stringent, or where the implementation and enforcement of laws are not effective, the likelihood of pesticide poisoning may be greater [4].",

MET exposure has also been shown to be a factor in some reproductive disorders. Deleterious effects on male reproductive endpoints such as testosterone levels, semen quality [14,15] and ADN sperm [16,17], leading to infertility and/or structural and functional changes [9,15] have also been reported. These reproductive changes caused by contact with MET may compromise the survival of the exposed species. In this context, the present study was designed to evaluate the effects of the joint action of treatment time and exposure to methamidophos on the weight of reproductive organs (testes, epididymides and seminal vesicles), the dynamics of spermatogenesis, daily sperm production (DSP), the Sertoli cell number with evident nucleoli in the germinal epithelium and sperm transit time in the epididymis of adult Swiss mice.",

Then 400 \u03bcl of these homogenates was added to 600 \u03bcl of the solution. The samples (testis and epididymis homogenates) were placed in a haemocytometer (Neubauer chamber, 0.0025 mm2, depth 0.100 mm) to count homogenization-resistant spermatids (step 16) under a light microscope at 400\u00d7 magnification. Counts were performed in four replicates, and each replicate was evaluated by averaging counts from five different squares, each with 16 fields (Supplementary Data 4). DSP was calculated by dividing the total number of spermatids resistant to homogenization found per testis by 4.84 (the number of days spermatids are present in the seminiferous epithelium) and the sperm transit time was estimated from the ratio of the number of sperm in each epididymal segment (caput/corpus and cauda) and the DSP.",

Following long-term exposure, no significant changes in the absolute/relative weights of reproductive organs were noted in the MET group, compared to control. However, the analysis between the MET groups in respect of exposure time showed that long-term treatment caused an increase in the absolute weight of the cauda epididymis (F(1, 35) = 4.333; P <  0.05; Fig. 1A) and seminal vesicles with fluid (F(1, 35) = 9.733; P <  0.05; Fig. 1B) when compared to short-term treatment. This increase was also observed in the relative weight of the caput/corpus (F(1, 35) = 8.116; P <  0.05; Fig. 2A) and cauda epididymis (F(1, 35) = 7.801; P <  0.05; Fig. 2B) epididymis and seminal vesicle with fluid (F(1, 35) = 16.798; P <  0.001; Fig. 2C). No difference was found in the final body and testes weight in both short and long-term exposure (Supplementary Data 5).",

However, there was also a reduction in the cauda epididymis weight, even with the increased number of spermatozoa. MET has the potential to interfere with the cholinergic system [8] and promote acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition (being considered an AChE inhibitor (AChEI)), thus increasing the supply of acetylcholine (ACh) in the muscarinic and nicotinic synapses (Fig. 6\n), which causes OP poisoning [22]. Additionally, studies suggest that both acute and chronic OP intoxication disrupt the redox processes, changing the activities of antioxidative enzymes and causing enhancement of lipid peroxidation in several organs, leading to tissue damage due to AChE inhibition [23,24].",

This may be related to the downregulation process. It is known that chronic stimulation of muscarinic receptors (mAChR) induces receptor downregulation, resulting in loss of cellular response to future agonist stimulations in cultured cells [25]. Thus, a decrease in receptor density may be responsible for the weight increase observed in this study. Furthermore, downregulation may have occurred in the vas deferens musculature and hindered ejaculation, since mAChR are expressed in the vas deferens of rodents [26,27]. This event, in turn, may have promoted the accumulation of spermatozoa in the epididymides, resulting in the increased weight of this tissue observed after long-term exposure. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the events involving MET and mAChR in the male reproductive tract and the consequences for male fertility.",

Studies with other OP have shown that rodent spermatogenesis stages are sensitive to the action of these substances [28,29]. In the present study, the mitotic stages V\u2013VI and IX were more susceptible to the action of MET following short-term exposure to 0.004 mg.kg\u22121, whereas long-term exposure accentuated the mitotic alterations, with an increase in stages I\u2013IV and V\u2013VI, and a reduction in stage IX. Long-term treatment also reduced the spermiation stages (VII\u2013VIII), which are essential in the dynamics of spermatogenesis. Spermiation is the final stage of spermatogenesis and involves the release of the spermatozoa from the Sertoli cell into the lumen of the seminiferous epithelium. This process is also related to the transfer of spermatozoa to the epididymis [30]. The reduction of these stages results in there being less spermatozoa available for fertilization. Farag et al. [15] reported a reduction in spermatozoa in mice treated with high doses of MET (2.0 and 3.0 mg.kg\u22121 for 4 weeks).",

These receptors are expressed in different cell types in the epididymides of rodents and are involved in the modulation of smooth muscle contraction and epithelial cell activity [26,27]. Thus, hyperstimulation of the mAChR and cholinergic overload may have increased contractility and promoted the release of spermatozoa from the epididymis.

This event increases phospholipase C (PLC) activity, which degrades membrane phospholipids into inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 leads to release of intracellular Ca2+. DAG has a role in the late (tonic) phase of the cell response; (5) In the nicotinic receptors (nAChR), ACh promotes a graded depolarization of postsynaptic membrane with Na+ input. This event results in cell response; (6) ACh action ceases when it is broken down into acetate and choline by acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme; (7) Choline reuptake occurs from the synaptic cleft into the presynaptic neuron, being used to synthesize new molecules of ACh; (8) Methamidophos (MET) inhibits AChE and prolongs duration of ACh at the synaptic terminals.",
