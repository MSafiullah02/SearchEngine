She had emigrated from a country with a high prevalence of TB to one with a lower prevalence. This presented a challenge to her physicians who were faced with identifying and treating close contacts who were also infected. This Perspective article explores in more depth some of the questions raised by this case report. It discusses the role of primary care physicians in low prevalence countries who can implement evidence-based screening programmes, it discusses effective strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of TB in countries with high TB prevalence, and it presents insights from medical anthropology that can help practitioners overcome the barriers to TB diagnosis, treatment and screening described in the case report.",

It is possible that they could have been screened at an asymptomatic stage when the entire family may have had latent, rather than active TB. Positive results of screening would have triggered referral for further assessment by the local specialist TB team. It is likely they would have been offered chemoprophylaxis to prevent reactivation of TB. Early identification of latent TB infection in these family members could have prevented reactivation to active disease and \u2014 in the case of those members with pulmonary TB (the mother and children) \u2014 potential further transmission to others. Clearly these benefits would only be possible if migrants are able, and indeed encouraged, to register in primary care.
