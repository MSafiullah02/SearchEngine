            "text": "Several studies suggest that exposure to 50 Hz magnetic fields may promote chemically induced breast cancer in rats. Groups of 100 female Sprague-Dawley rats were initiated with four weekly 5 mg gavage doses of 7,12dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) starting at 50 days of age. After the first weekly DMBA administration, exposure to ambient fields (sham exposed), 50 Hz magnetic fields at either 1 or 5 G field intensity or 60 Hz fields at 1 G for 18.5 h/day, 7 days/week was initiated. Exposure continued for 13 weeks. A vehicle control group without DMBA was included. In a second study, using lower doses of DMBA, groups of 100 female Sprague-Dawley rats were initiated with four weekly doses of 2 mg of DMBA starting at 50 days of age followed, after the first weekly DMBA administration, by exposure to ambient fields (sham exposed) or 50 Hz magnetic fields at either 1 or 5 G field intensity for 18.5 h/day, 7 days/week for 13 weeks. Rats were weighed and palpated weekly for the presence of tumors. There was no effect of magnetic field exposure on body weight gains or on the time of appearance of mammary tumors in either study. At the end of 13 weeks, the animals were killed and the mammary tumors counted and measured. Mammary gland masses found grossly were examined histologically. In the first 13 week study, the mammary gland carcinoma incidences were 92, 86, 96 and 96% for the DMBA controls, 1 G, 50 Hz, 5 G, 50 Hz and 1 G, 60 Hz groups, respectively. The total numbers of carcinomas were 691, 528 (P < 0.05, decrease), 561 and 692 for the DMBA controls, 1 G, 50 Hz, 5 G, 50 Hz and 1 G, 60 Hz groups, respectively. In study 2, the mammary gland carcinoma incidences were 43, 48 and 38% for the DMBA controls, 1 G, 50 Hz and 5 G, 50 Hz groups, respectively. The total numbers of carcinomas were 102, 90 and 79 for the DMBA controls, 1 G, 50 Hz and 5 G, 50 Hz groups, respectively. There was no effect of magnetic field exposure on tumor size either by in-life palpation or by measurement at necropsy in either study. There was no evidence that 50 or 60 Hz magnetic fields promoted breast cancer in these studies in female rats. These studies do not support the hypothesis that magnetic field exposure promotes breast cancer in this DMBA rat model.",

These fields are predominantly of low frequency (60 Hz in the USA, 50 Hz in Europe and Japan) and generally of low intensity. Electric fields exist when there is electric potential in a line, while magnetic fields exist only when there is current flow (1) . Since both electric and magnetic fields often occur together and are interactive, these fields have often been referred to as electric and magnetic fields, or EMFs. Trees, walls and other objects shield electric fields while magnetic fields usually penetrate non-ferrous material. Thus, most residential exposure is to magnetic fields. Recent research has focused on potential adverse health effects of exposure to magnetic fields. Most homes have magnetic field intensities of \u03fd2 mG or 0.2 \u00b5T, although some areas in homes may exceed this. In some industries, mean workplace magnetic field exposure may exceed 10 mG (2) .",

Even a small effect of EMF on the incidence of breast cancer in women has potential major health implications.

In an attempt to confirm whether magnetic fields could promote breast cancer in rats, we used a DMBA initiation/promotion model in Sprague-Dawley rats with magnetic field exposure similar to conditions used in studies from the Hannover laboratory. We used repeated administration of the initiating chemical with four weekly doses of 5 mg DMBA (total 20 mg DMBA/rat) followed by 13 weeks of magnetic field promotion to test potential promoting effects of these fields on breast cancer. When this regimen caused \u03fe90% tumors in the exposure and control groups, a second study using a lower dose of DMBA (8 mg total) following the same repeated administration of the initiating chemical was conducted. We also added the American power line frequency (60 Hz) in addition to 50 Hz for the magnetic field exposures.",

The animals were quarantined for 13 days and were 50 days of age on the first day of the study. Before initiation of the study, 10 rats were randomly selected for parasite evaluation and gross observation for evidence of disease. The study animals were randomized by weight into treatment groups using a computer-generated randomization scheme. At the end of the study, serological analyses were performed on five rats from each of the two exposure rooms. Serological evaluation for Sendai virus, pneumonia virus of mice, rat coronavirus/ sialodacroadenitis virus and Kilham rat virus/H-1 virus failed to reveal any abnormalities either prior to study start or at the end of the study.",

The animal rooms were monitored for temperature, humidity and light status every 6 min. Cages were rotated on each rack once per week. The lights were on a 12:12 light/dark cycle with 47 lux at the bottom cages and 85 lux at the top cages. A system of dim red lighting (Phillips 15 W lamps) provided nighttime lighting of \u03fd0.1 lux in the animal rooms. Temperature was maintained between 66 and 77\u00b0F and relative humidity between 35 and 65%. The exposure room had a sound level of~59 dB, with~53 dB in the control room. The heating of the field generating coils at 5 G was \u03fd1\u00b0C and there was no measurable change in temperature at the cage level. The Earth's static magnetic fields were measured in the animal rooms and varied between 0.48 and 0.54 G.",

Briefly, the magnetic field exposure system consisted of three identical field generating coil sets in a single room, each associated with an individual animal exposure rack. Each coil set consisted of four pairs of vertically oriented coils connected in series that were spaced on each system. Pairs of coils were stacked one above the other; the bottom coils produced horizontal magnetic fields in one direction while the top coils produced magnetic fields opposite to that of the lower coils. This arrangement helped minimize stray fields. The wires in the coils were embedded in plastic to minimize coil vibration and hum and the plastic cases of the coils could be cleaned without danger of harming the electrical hardware.",

On day 1 of the study, four groups of 100 female Sprague-Dawley rats were administered 5 mg DMBA dissolved in 1 ml of sesame oil by gavage. Three additional weekly doses of 5 mg DMBA were administered by gavage. Of the four groups administered DMBA, one group received no magnetic field exposure and served as a DMBA control group. Three groups of rats administered DMBA were exposed to magnetic fields at intensities/frequencies of 1 G, 50 Hz, 5 G, 50 Hz or 1 G, 60 Hz for 18.5 h/day, 7 days/week for 13 weeks. An additional 100 female rats were administered 1 ml of sesame oil on day 1 of the study and three additional doses in succeeding weeks. These rats received no magnetic field exposure and served as a vehicle control group. In a second 13 week study, three groups of 100 female Sprague-Dawley rats were administered 2 mg DMBA dissolved in 1 ml of sesame oil by gavage. Three additional weekly doses of 2 mg DMBA were administered by gavage in corn oil. Of the three groups administered DMBA, one group received no magnetic field exposure, one group 1 G, 50 Hz and one group 5 G, 50 Hz magnetic field exposures. Rats were weighed prior to study start, weekly thereafter and again at necropsy. The rats were palpated weekly; masses were located by specific mammary gland (L1-L6 and R1-R6). Two individuals each palpated half of the rats, alternating groups of rats each week. Size was determined by comparing the palpated masses with wooden spheres of defined diameters. When there was a discrepancy between the previous week in number or size of the masses, then both individuals palpated the animal and resolved the discrepancy. At the time of necropsy, the clinical observations were available to the pathologist; additional masses were found at necropsy. The skin and mammary glands were removed and placed on a light box to visualize the tumors. Masses were measured in two directions and collected in formalin. The mammary glands, lung, liver, kidney and all masses were fixed in formalin, stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined histologically in study 1. In study 2, the mammary glands and all masses were examined histologically. Each gross lesion was uniquely identified and followed through processing; histological diagnoses were correlated with each gross lesion identified in the mammary gland. The measurements at necropsy were used to calculate the area of the mammary gland carcinomas for each group.",

Total number of carcinomas found on histological examination in female rats receiving DMBA followed by sham or magnetic field exposure during the second 13 week study. The number of tumors per tumor-bearing rat is given above each bar. One rat in the 5 G, 50 Hz exposure group had an adenoma. This data is not included in the figure.",

In fact, there were significantly fewer total numbers of carcinomas in the 1 G, 50 Hz exposure group in study 1 and a tendency for fewer tumors in the exposure groups in study 2. There was also a tendency for fewer tumors/ rat in the exposed groups. Our data are consistent with the findings of Ekstrom (22) , who also observed fewer tumors in the magnetic field-exposed animals compared with the DMBA controls. This is also similar to a 26 week study that we reported previously (17) .",

In some studies reporting effects of magnetic field exposure, there was no difference in the number of mammary tumors/tumor-bearing rat (11, 13, 16, 23) . Some studies also reported no difference in the incidence of tumors with magnetic field exposure (10), but one of the studies involved small numbers of animals at low field intensities (13) . The positive effects reported were often an earlier onset of tumors (11, 16, 23) or an increase in tumor size (10, 11, 14) . However, in some studies there was no increase in tumor size (16, 23) . We found no indication for earlier onset of tumors, but in the second 13 week study there was a small but insignificant increase in tumor size (controls, 1.9 cm 2 ; 1 G, 50 Hz, 2.0 cm 2 ; 5 G, 50 Hz, 2.2 cm 2 ). However, when the data are expressed as carcinoma area/animal there is a small decrease (controls, 1.9 cm 2 ; 1 G, 50 Hz, 1.8 cm 2 ; 5 G, 50 Hz, 1.7 cm 2 ). Further, there was no tendency for an increase in tumor size in the first 13 week study (2.2, 2.4, 2.0 and 2.1 cm 2 for the control, 5 G, 50 Hz, 5 G, 50 Hz and 1 G, 60 Hz groups, respectively). Thus, our interpretation is that these studies do not provide evidence that magnetic field exposure increases tumor size. Finally, the palpation data do not suggest that there is an earlier onset of tumors.",

The reported promotional effects of magnetic fields on breast cancer in the rat are subtle and not always consistent (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) .
