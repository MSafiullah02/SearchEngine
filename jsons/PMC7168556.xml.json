PEDV is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED), which has high mortality in suckling piglets (Debouck & Pensaert, 1980; Pijpers, Nieuwstadt, Terpstra, & Verheijden, 1993). This disease was initially documented in the United Kingdom in 1971. Since 1990s, PED was not serious. However, outbreak of PED suddenly occurred in the United States, Canada and Mexico causing huge economic losses (Mole, 2013; Stevenson et al., 2013; Vlasova et al., 2014). In addition, PED caused tremendous economic losses to the swine industry in Europe and Asia, including China, Korea and Japan (Kocherhans, Bridgen, Ackermann, & Tobler, 2001; Sun et al., 2012).",

            "text": "In recent years, PEDV has re\u2010emerged as one of the deadliest and most contagious pathogens in swine, causing large economic losses to the global swine industry. The biosecurity, vaccination and feedback are the fundamental methods for managing the disease, but these methods do not effectively eradicate and block PEDV (Chae et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2010; Li et al., 2012; Lowe et al., 2014; Olanratmanee, Kunavongkrit, & Tummaruk, 2010). In this study, we isolated one strain of PEDV from intestinal contents from PED\u2010affected pigs in China. The complete genome of PEDV named HLJBY was sequenced and then submitted to Genbank. To provide insight into the understanding of the genetic, phylogenetic and the current epidemiological status of PEDV, PEDV HLJBY was compared with CV777 and other PEDV strains. CV777\u2010based vaccine did not block the new PEDV variants circulated in China since 2011 effectively (Li et al., 2012). Therefore, the relationship of PEDV HLJBY with CV777 was analysed firstly. The results showed that the homology between the entire genomic nucleotide sequences of PEDV HLJBY and CV777 was 97.7%. Next, the homology of each component of PEDV HLJBY and CV777 was explored. The range of homology of each component of PEDV HLJBY and CV777 was 99.0%\u201091.7%. The homology of M gene was the highest (99.0%), which demonstrated M gene was the most conservative. However, the homology of ORF3 gene between PEDV HLJBY and CV777 was 97.7%, and protein of ORF3 was 90.1%, which revealed the identify of ORF3 gene between PEDV HLJBY and CV777 was the lowest. Therefore, ORF3 gene might determine the different properties of PEDV HLJBY and CV777. The ORF3 is the only auxiliary factor of PEDV. It was predicated that ORF3 had four transmembrane regions and formed homology (Wang et al., 2012). ORF3 may contribute to the virulence of PEDV. The ORF3 was a key gene for PEDV culture in vitro. ORF3 gene was usually used to differentiate between field and vaccine\u2010derived isolates and altered the virulence of PEDV (Park et al., 2008). In addition, the PEDV S protein is an important viral gene for studying genetic relatedness among isolates and epidemiology of PEDV (Chen et al., 2014; Gerber et al., 2014; Lee, 2015; Lee et al., 2010; Lee & Lee, 2014; Oh et al., 2014). Nucleotide sequencing of S gene analysis revealed that 3 nt deletions were found in S gene of PEDV HLJBY compared with CV777 (Figure 2c) and the nucleotide sequence identity is 97.0%. The amino acid sequence identity of S protein was 96.0% between PEDV HLJBY and CV777. 3 nt deletions of S gene were located in the amino terminus of S gene, which was suitable to analyse the significant differences in epidemiology of PEDV(Li et al., 2012; Temeeyasen et al., 2014; Vlasova et al., 2014). S gene functions as a receptor\u2010binding domain(Belouzard, Millet, Licitra, & Whittaker, 2012). The 3 nt deletions might be leading to the change in structure and function of S protein. S gene might play a vital role in the genetic evolutionary process of PEDV. Therefore, it will be the focus of future research.",

Our study will provide more information about diversity, evolution, and in particular, the epidemic characteristics of PEDV including HLJBY, which will give insight into the virulence of PEDV.
