Although direct evidence is lacking to support changing or withholding anticancer therapy in cancer patients 2,3 , the report showed that they had poorer outcomes from COVID-19, especially older patients 1 Our Cancer Institute, located in North-Eastern Italy, treats 120 outpatients daily with radiotherapy, coming from different Italian regions: 52% are over 65 years of age (several with co-morbidities) and 7% are younger than 10 years. Most children are enrolled in clinical trials and treated daily with high conformal techniques and conventional fractionation.",

Specific rules for children: 1) different waiting rooms for adults and children; 2) only one parent allowed; 3) no patient overlapping; 4) only one patient in need of sedation per recovery room; 5) individual toys for each child to be later disinfected; 6) suspension of hospital school and limitation of psychological support.",

            "text": ". Most comorbidities have been observed in COVID-19 positive deceased patients: in Italy, only 2,1% of deaths had no co-morbidities, instead 16,5% had a history of active cancer in the past 5 years 4 . Consequently, more attention is needed in patients with cancer in case of rapid clinical deterioration or symptoms suggestive of infection1,5 .From Jan to Feb 8-2020, 2143 COVID-19 pediatric patients were reported in China: 4% were asymptomatic and in a high proportion of patients, symptoms were generally milder compared to adults6 . The median incubation period of this virus is 5.2 days 7 , although some suggest up to 14. It is unclear when transmission begins, but the asymptomatic phase may play an important role. No data are available for children with cancer during chemotherapy, although three positive pediatric cases with solid tumors (2 hepatoblastomas, 1 rhabdoid tumor) recruited in Bergamo Pediatric Oncology Unit, Italy's hardest-hit city, have overcome post-chemotherapy neutropenia without additional problems given by COVID-19 (M. Provenzi, personal communication, 24 March 2020). During a pandemic, radiotherapy centers remain among the few departments treating both adults and children. Practical recommendations have been recently proposed by colleagues of the \"Red Zone\", an area between Milan and Venice in Northern Italy, to continue the radiotherapy while protecting patients, families, and health professionals from the infection 8 . Hypofractionation, as suggested for adult patients to mitigate the duration of treatment in these exceptional times 9 , is not sufficiently validated in most pediatric tumors. On March 31, at 5\u00b700 p.m., the Italian Minister of Health reported 105,792 cases of COVID-19 infection in Italy, with a median age of 62 years, yielding 12,428 deaths and 15,729 recoveries. The total number of swabs carried out so far is 506,968 10 . From the beginning ofMarch 2020, all Italian people must stay at home. No unnecessary journey or social contact is allowed. They can leave home for grocery shopping or medical needs, only.",
