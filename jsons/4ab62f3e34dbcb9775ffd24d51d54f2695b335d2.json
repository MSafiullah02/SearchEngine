The sample (20 \u00b5L) was dried on the surface of a platinum attenuated total reflectance plate (ATR-diamond crystal) with cold air until a thin dehydrated film was formed. FTIR absorbance spectra were collected using a Bruker FTIR spectrometer. Data were collected between 4000-500 cm \u22121 wavenumber ranges, at 1 nm data point resolution, 256 scans co-addition, and a Blackman-Harris-3-term apodization (Goormaghtigh et al. 1994a) . To enhance the data quality, the spectral resolution was kept at 4 cm -1 . To eliminate the absorption due to the buffer components and residual water in the amide I region at 1645 cm \u22121 , the spectra for the buffer were recorded and subtracted from the spectra of the purified protein. The data manipulation, base line correction, data storage, and recording of spectra were performed using OPUS 1.4 software (Bruker). Origin software version 7.0 (Origin Lab Corporation, USA) (Wass 2002) was used for obtaining the secondary derivative in the region between 1700-1600 cm -1 (amide I region) and individual peaks were resolved using Galactic PeakSolve TM program (version 1.05) to achieve the best fit for all the peaks in the amide I region.",

In the case of SPF-antisera at 5x dilution, the signal can be hardly seen at the control line. Therefore, other dilutions of SPF-antisera (10x, 20x, 30x and 100x) were evaluated to get enhanced signals at the control line, and results suggested that the detection signal increases with decreasing the antisera concentration. c The LFD kit prepared using antisera raised against the VP2 protrusion domain (printed on the control line) was tested using buffer (10 mM NaH x PO 4 , pH 7.4) and SPF-antisera separately, producing an enhanced signal on the control line in each case. C and T denote the control line and the test line, respectively.",

The VP2 protrusion domain has been used in this study to develop a lateral flow assay for the detection of anti-IBDV antibodies in chickens. 5 Supplementary Fig. S2 Detection of IBD viral RNA by RT-PCR. The RT-PCR product of 743bp was amplified from viral RNA extracted from bursa of Fabricius of an IBDV-infected chicken, and analyzed through electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel. Lane M shows molecular weight markers (1 kb) (Promega). Lane 1 shows the RT-PCR product of 743bp of a local IBDV strain. Supplementary Fig. S3 PCR amplification of gene encoding the VP2 protrusion domain. The PCR product of 417 bp was amplified from viral RNA of bursa of Fabricius of an IBDV-infected chicken, and analyzed through electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel. Lane M shows molecular weight markers (1 kb) (Promega). Lane 1 shows the PCR product of 417 bp representing the gene encoding the VP2 protrusion domain. Supplementary Fig. S4 Cloning strategy for the generation of pET28a-PreS-VP2 protrusion domain construct. The PCR-amplified nucleotide sequence encoding the VP2 protrusion domain was inserted into pET28a-PreScission vector using Nde I and EcoR I restriction sites to generate the pET28a-PreS-VP2 protrusion domain expression vector, allowing the expression of the VP2 protrusion domain fused to an oligo-histidine tag (His 6 ) and a PreScission (HRV 3C) protease recognition site at the N-terminus.
