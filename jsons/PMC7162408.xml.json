Of all the viral infections, the leading cause of COPD is rhinovirus (HRV) accounting for approximately 58%. Few pathogens such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human coronavirus (HCoV), influenza virus (Flu), parainfluenza virus (PIV) and human adenovirus (HADV) are also included in the cause of COPD.5, 6 Bacteria can be easily separated with specific remedial effects and, therefore, are easier to confirm, but viruses are hard to be isolated and detected to bring effective treatment outcomes. Therefore, importance of virus is not adequately recognized. Recently, with the development of clinical application of nucleic acid detection technology for respiratory viruses, the importance of viral infection in AECOPD has been increasingly regarded.7\n",

Some AECOPD patients performed a spirometry when his symptoms bad been relieved before discharged or within one month after discharged from the hospital.

Based on the definition of an older or elderly person by the World health organization,17 we classified all the AECOPD patients into elderly group (age >65 years old, n = 199) and nonelderly group (age \u2264 65years old, n = 65), and compared the aforementioned clinical parameters. The results showed statistically significant differences in age, pulmonary hypertension value, length of hospital stay, days of antibiotic use and number of patients with viral infection between elderly group and nonelderly group (all P < .05, Table 2). In addition, for adopting the diagnostic criteria for community\u2010acquired pneumonia,18 we also classified all the patients from AECOPD virus+ group into virus+ patients with pneumonia group (n = 41) and virus+ patients without pneumonia group (n = 31) and compared the above clinical indices between these two groups. We found that the patients in the two groups differed significantly in body temperature, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, length of hospital stay and days of antibiotic use (all P < .05, Table 3).",

Flu (FluA and FluB) was highly detected virus. Our results were consistent with the study results by Koul et al,27 Tan et al29 and Biancardi et al,23 but inconsistent with the study results by Hosseini et al,30 Dimopoulos et al,22 Kherad et al8 and Greenberg et al.31 The characteristics of Flu frequently occurred in the temperate zones, especially in East Asia,32 which might be another reason for the prevalence of H7N9 virus infection in China.33 HRV prevalence was followed by Flu, which was inconsistent with the study results by Wilkinson et al,34 Djamin et al35 and Varkey et al36 in Euro\u2010American region. In Euro\u2010American region, HRV was the primary infective virus in patients with AECOPD, but HRV lacked an effective vaccination and hence was higher in Euro\u2010American region than that in other Asian regions. Other viruses such as HADV, RSVA and HCoV were detected in low rates, at 1.5%, 1.5% and 1.21%, respectively. This was inconsistent with some study results, for example Hosseini et al30 found that HADV was highly detected virus at a rate of 9.4%. Similarly, Dimopoulos et al22 found RSV at a rate of 28.5% and Greenberg et al31 found HCoV at a rate of 4.9%. The high prevalence rates of these viruses might be related to some factors such as the sampling period, test method, patients age, and so on.22, 30 HBoV and HMPV were poorly detected. But according to the results of Hosseini et al30 and Ringshausen et al,37 HBoV showed a relatively high detection rate. Martinello et al38 and Perotin et al39 showed that HMPV was the second most common virus detected. The two respiratory viruses were discovered recently and the dilemma still existed as to whether these were related to COPD exacerbations. Because of these differences in their detection rates, further research was still warranted for more definitive conclusions.",

In addition, this study also found that older patients were significantly higher than nonelderly patients with viral infections, which was not in accordance with the study results of Dimopoulos et al.5 It might be associated with regional differences, poor physical state, long COPD course, susceptibility of secondary bacterial infections, long recovery duration, and so on.",

These results showed obvious differences with the IFN\u2010\u03b3 results in Almansa et al43 study.
