A few transplant programs will not perform transplants on patients colonized with resistant Burkholderia or Pseudomonas. For instance, it has been shown that patients colonized with Burkholderia cenocepacia (genovar III) have a much lower survival rate than patients colonized with other species of the B. cepacia complex (4). For this reason, many transplant programs may refuse to perform transplants on patients colonized with B. cenocepacia. Surgeons who do perform transplants on patients colonized with these bacteria often use broad-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis in the peri- and post-operative periods. Cystic fibrosis patients with a single LT may be at greater risk of pneumonia, as the native lung functions as a reservoir for these resistant pathogens (5). Laboratory diagnosis of the most commonly encountered bacterial infections requires the use of only routine culture media along with manual or automated identification and antimicrobial susceptibility methods. Most organisms can be fully identified, with antibiotic susceptibility results available within 48 h. However, fastidious and/or uncommon organisms may need the use of special media and incubation conditions, requiring additional time for isolation and complete identification (6).",

Six were diagnosed via histologic examination of the explanted lung and underwent therapy. Five of the remaining 6 patients developed evidence of subclinical disease after 3 months, and 4 of the 6 eventually developed symptoms. The 2 patients without symptoms had positive M. tuberculosis cultures from broncho-alveolar lavage (see \u201cHeart Transplant\u201d below for laboratory diagnosis of M. tuberculosis). Half of the patients died by the end of the study, but in all cases, it was attributed to BO. Interestingly, the 3 patients who were PPD positive at the time of transplantation and did not receive prophylaxis developed active tuberculosis. Tuberculosis therapy in transplant patients is complicated by the severe drug interaction between rifampin and calcineurin inhibitors.",

Compared with other SOTs, lung and heart-lung transplant patients have more CMV disease, with an incidence of 38 to 75% in individuals who do not receive prophylaxis (1). This may be due to the higher degree of immunosuppressive therapy used in these patients compared to other transplant recipients. Besides life-threatening pneumonitis, CMV can cause hepatitis, enteritis, and colitis after transplantation. CMV may also predispose individuals to bacteremia, Aspergillus infection, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). Most worrisome, CMV disease is associated with BO. Different strategies are employed to prevent CMV disease after LT (see \u201cHeart Transplant\u201d below for laboratory diagnosis of CMV). Most commonly, prophylaxis with valganciclovir is used due to ease of administration. In lung transplantation, longer courses (6 months or greater) of antiviral therapy may be used (10). Ganciclovir resistance may occur, requiring treatment with higher doses of ganciclovir or foscarnet. These high doses increase the side effect of bone marrow suppression, specifically, leukopenia.",

LT recipients may present with atypical symptoms, such as a subtle decrease in pulmonary function. Viral shedding is often prolonged. In addition, respiratory viral infections are a risk factor for both acute and chronic rejection (13). In a comparison of 50 LT recipients with respiratory viral infections and 50 without infections, 8 of the infected patients developed BO 3 months post-infection compared with none in the uninfected cohort patient population (14). Laboratory diagnosis of viral infections may require the use of routine cell cultures, shell vial cell cultures, immunofluorescence techniques, rapid immunoblot or enzyme immunoassay (EIA) testing, or molecular analysis. Due to the relatively low sensitivity and specificity of many of the rapid tests, confirmatory testing by other methods is usually required, and the use of molecular analysis is becoming more commonplace. Specifically, multiplex molecular testing is detecting increases in mixed viral infections, which were not previously detected using traditional viral culture methods. The significance of mixed viral infections is not fully known, but preliminary findings show increased severity of disease in some cases, which may impact the care and treatment of the patient.",

Histoplasma infection is rare post-transplantation, with an estimated incidence of <1% in areas of endemicity. This infection occurs after inhalation of the organism and frequently results in pulmonary disease. If the infection is not cleared, the transplant recipient can develop disseminated disease involving the liver, spleen, bone marrow, mucosa, and skin. Symptoms include fever, chills, malaise, and fatigue. The diagnosis is made by culturing the affected tissue or by histologic examination. Other methods of diagnosis include H. capsulatum capsular polysaccharide antigen testing of blood and urine by EIA or in situ hybridization. Treatment with amphotericin B followed by itraconazole is recommended (39).",

The diagnosis can be made histologically by visualizing the unique spherules of C. immitis. C. immitis may easily infect laboratory personnel, so appropriate safety precautions must be instituted when growth of a mold colony suggests the possibility of this organism. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, CSF, and tissue are the preferred specimens for diagnosis. Sputum may also be cultured; however, in some cases, sputum production may be scant.
