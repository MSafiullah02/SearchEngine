To obtain such datasets, we clustered the PDB and obtained the groups of chains with different identities and marked disordered residues. We elaborated a new procedure for finding disordered patterns and created a new version of the library. This library includes three sets of patterns: unique patterns, patterns consisting of two kinds of amino acids, and homo-repeats. Using this database, the user can: (1) find homologues in the entire Protein Data Bank; (2) perform a statistical analysis of disordered residues in protein structures; (3) search for disordered patterns and homo-repeats; (4) search for disordered regions in different chains of the same protein; (5) download clusters of protein chains with different identity from our database and library of disordered patterns; and (6) observe 3D structure interactively using MView. A new library of disordered patterns will help improve the accuracy of predictions for residues that will be structured or unstructured in a given region.",

It turned out that the patterns of length 7 residues and longer are mostly unfolded (N u -N f > 0), shorter ones are mostly ordered (see Table 1 and Figure 2 ). As can be seen from Figure 2 , the optimal length of the patterns is 8. The patterns of this length formed the basis of our database. Notes: N u /N f is the sum of the average number of unfolded/folded residues in the clusters with 75% identity (C75); N C75 is the number of the clusters with 75% identity (C75). We analyzed the occurrence of the AC2 patterns in the 122 (97 eukaryotic and 25 bacterial) proteomes and the random proteome. Interestingly, in the random proteome, there were about 40 We analyzed the occurrence of the AC2 patterns in the 122 (97 eukaryotic and 25 bacterial) proteomes and the random proteome. Interestingly, in the random proteome, there were about 40 thousand residues (40,521) in the AC2 patterns, while in the real proteomes, there were more than four million (4, 447, 128) . That is, in the real proteins, AC2 sequences were 100 times more than in the random ones. If we multiply the previously calculated P AC2 (8) by the number of residues in the proteome base, we get 48 thousand residues. This is in a good agreement with the data for the random proteome. Of particular interest are the AC2 sequences with internal repetition: dipeptide repeats (01) and four-peptide repeats (0001, 0010, 0011, 0100, 0110, 0111). Symbols 0 and 1 conceal any pair of amino acids. In the proteomes, such patterns covered 585,638 residues, and in the random sequences 2569, that is, the AC2 sequences with an internal repeat occurred 300 times more often than expected. In the real proteins from the proteomes, every fourth protein contains the AC2 sequences. Or rather, 331,279 real proteins out of the 1,449,561 present in the database contained the AC2 sequences.",

As can be seen, such patterns occurred in the proteomes significantly more often than expected. This is due to the fact that homo-repeats are more common in proteomes than would be expected from the frequency of amino acids (Lobanov et al., 2016) . Moreover, the homo-repeats of histidine are also quite common. Here, it is important only to emphasize that in the PDB, almost all histidine homo-repeats were the artificial additives, and were natural motifs in the proteomes. Patterns associated with the histidine tag in the PDB, but not containing parts of the histidine tag, were found in the proteomes at approximately the same frequency as expected: ENLxFQ (178:233), ASxTxxxxMGR (22:20) , and LVPRGS (56:66).",

            "text": "To create a library of disordered patterns, we considered the two-stage procedure using the clustered PDB by applying simpler rules than in our previous work [20, 21] . In the first stage, we created a list of candidate patterns. To be a candidate for a pattern, the considered pattern should be disordered in half the cases among chains from a cluster with 100% identity. We did not limit the length of the patterns. When we found the candidate in the patterns, we checked whether this candidate had met us before. If the pattern had been encountered, then it was discarded. Next, we searched for the homologues of each candidate in patterns with an identity above 80% for the entire database. That is, if the length of the candidate was 3-5 residues, then we did not look for homologues. If the length was 6-10 residues, then one substitution was allowed in the homologue, two substitutions for a length of 11-15 residues, and so on. When the homologue was found, we designed a new pattern with the ability to select any residue in positions diverging between the candidate and its homologue. We marked the discrepancies with the letter X. Again, we checked if we had selected the generated template previously. If not, then the generated template was added to the list of candidates. If we found several homologues diverging in different positions, then the combined template was added to the list of candidates in the patterns. We will explain all the above by using an example. Therefore, we found the following candidates and homologues: We can say that pattern A matches the chain P at the position s, if all residues of the pattern coincide with the residues of the sequence, except for the residues marked with the letter X. Next, we considered the following terminology: N u is the sum of the average number of unfolded residues in clusters with 75% identity (C75); N f is the sum of the average number of ordered residues in the clusters with 75% identity matched by the pattern; C u is the number of clusters with an identity of 75% in which N u > N f ; C f is the number of clusters with an identity of 75% in which N u \u2264 N f . It should be noted that N u and N f (in the pattern) corresponded to the number of disordered and ordered residues if each 75% cluster had one sequence. Protein P has an occurrence of pattern A, if A matches P at position s. Fragment A = P j [s + 1, s + L] of chain P j is considered as a candidate disordered pattern if it meets the following conditions: (C1) C u \u2265 5; (C2) C u > C f ; (C3) N u > N f . There were 198,382 patterns satisfying conditions C1, C2, and C3. After choosing homo-repeats and AC2 patterns, we had 177,964 patterns left. In the next step, we selected disordered patterns from the candidate list using the following iterative greedy procedure. Of the 177,964 patterns, we selected a pattern with a maximum value of D = N u \u2212 N f . Then, for the remaining patterns, the values of N u , N f , C u , and C f were recalculated without taking into account the residues matched by the first pattern. Again, all other patterns were checked for compliance with conditions C1, C2, and C3. Among the remaining patterns satisfying conditions C1, C2, and C3, a pattern with a maximum value of D was selected. If there were no patterns satisfying conditions C1, C2, and C3, the procedure was stopped. The iterative procedure was stopped when 1329 patterns were selected (D > 0). Finally, we were interested in patterns for which D \u2265 25 (a value of 25 corresponds to summing the weights of five whole disordered patterns with five residues in length in five clusters without neighboring regions, or terminal occurrence). There were 518 of such patterns.",

Other patterns are also often added along with the histidine tag. Since the additives are artificial, they, as a rule, are not ordered and are not visible during x-ray analysis. Therefore, our method inevitably includes such regions in our library of disordered residues. To separate natural patterns from artificial additives, we studied how often there were less than 40 amino acid residues between the found patterns and histidine tag. We calculated how many percent (PC) cases the pattern occurred near the histidine tag (Table 4 ). We cannot argue that all the patterns linked to the histidine tag are really artificial additives. Some of the patterns can be found simply at the Nor C-terminus of the protein, and it is there that researchers add the histidine tag for routine protein purification.
