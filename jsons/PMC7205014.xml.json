However, unlike in the past, this is a public health emergency that is developing in a globalized and interconnected world like never before. The infectious disease is developing and spreading in an economic and socio-cultural context characterized by populations that tend to aggregate in highly urbanized and overcrowded contexts and by extreme ease of movement, including intercontinental travel (5, 6). The way in which the COVID-19 epidemic is spreading must also be considered, it has rightly been compared to a real \u201ctsunami\u201d wave (7). In fact, the epidemic is expressed by the tremendous number of infections in an extremely short period of time, thus affecting large portions of the population, which leads to the concentration of a disproportionate number of requests for assistance compared to the emergency response capacity of the health systems.",

Nonetheless, the absence of a common pandemic plan in Italy and Europe, with Regions and individual countries that are still adopting different methods of managing the epidemic, runs the concrete risk of dissolving the effectiveness of the stringent measures implemented in different areas or countries. This can also be observed in China, where, in the face of an internal growth of new cases equal to zero over the past few days, new infections have been recorded due to the presence of the so-called \u201cre-entry cases.\u201d It must also be taken into account that the epidemic spread will occur with peaks at different times and areas, within and between the various countries, so the overall consequences will be related to the effectiveness of the different health systems.",

However, it is also likely that due to the lack of available, prompt, and reliably diagnostic procedures, the officially identified cases only represent the tip of the iceberg, with a spread of unidentified mild/asymptomatic cases well above the estimates.",
