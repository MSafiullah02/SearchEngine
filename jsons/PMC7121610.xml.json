Such an event would not be unprecedented as humans have suffered from devastating infectious disease epidemics before. The initial stages of the European Black Death (1346\u20131353) killed an estimated 60% of the population of Europe (Benedictow 2004). Up to 90% of the indigenous population in the Americas are estimated to have died in successive waves of smallpox, measles, plague and typhus outbreaks introduced by European settlers (Hays 2005).",

Lower income countries carry the majority of the current global burden of infectious disease and are the most likely locations for novel disease spillover from animal reservoirs and adaptation to human transmission.

Within a few months, the capacity for human reproduction could be so reduced that the human future would be catastrophically diminished. An alternative scenario would be the unrecognized introduction of a prion or a biological toxin with a long latency into the global food supply in a commodity such as one of the staple grains that is widely distributed and consumed. If, like prion-mediated disease, the agent had a multi-year latent period, billions of people could be exposed before the problem was ever recognized or linked to a specific food. Currently, an estimated 23% of the food produced for human consumption is traded internationally (D\u2019Odorico et al. 2014). This proportion has been steadily increasing and, due to shortage of land and water in many food importing countries with growing populations, as many as 5.2 billion people in 2050 are projected to be dependent on food grown outside of their country (Fader et al. 2013). The increased globalization of the food supply (Suweis et al. 2015) means that a long latency biological toxin that contaminates the food supply could generate a global catastrophe. Moreover, the increased dependency upon imported food staples means that large populations are at risk of emerging plant pathogens that might quickly undermine the availability of a key crop (Evans and Waller 2010; Strange and Scott 2005).",

For a natural pathogen to have highly catastrophic consequences, it must have two characteristics\u2014it must be both highly transmissible and cause high mortality or crippling morbidity. Often pathogens have one of these two characteristics but not both. Influenza, for example, is highly transmissible and can efficiently spread around the globe, but typically has low mortality (<0.05%) (Kelly et al. 2011; Nishiura 2010). Even if a novel strain of influenza approached the case fatality rate observed in the 1918 pandemic of 1\u20133% (Frost 1920), the vast majority of humanity would survive. Although such an outbreak would present a terrifying global shock, it would be less likely to alter the human future compared with outbreaks that killed more of the population, for example, the Black Death in Europe.",

Nipah virus, for example, is a virus whose wildlife reservoir is bats of the genus Pteropus (Halpin et al. 2011). The bats live across South and Southeast Asia, south into Australia and as far west as Madagascar (Nowak 1994). Although the virus causes no disease in bats (Middleton et al. 2007), when humans become infected, 40\u201380% die (Chua 2003; Luby et al. 2009). Person-to-person Nipah transmission occurs but is not efficient. On average, each infected patient transmits Nipah to <1 other person (Luby et al. 2009). Thus, person-to-person Nipah outbreaks generate non-sustained stuttering chains of transmission. It is a deadly disease for those infected, but the number of infected are few. However, if a virus like Nipah, that is a virus that has a high fatality rate and already has demonstrated competency for person-to-person transmission, were to develop an enhanced capacity for person-to-person transmission, it could present a global catastrophic biological risk.",

To date, biological weapons have not been the weapons of choice in most violent conflicts; however, recent developments increase future risk. CRISPR and other techniques of genome editing and associated developments in synthetic biology make it easier each year to genetically modify organisms, including human pathogens. Technology continues its exponential development becoming increasingly portable, increasingly powerful and less expensive. This expansion of biological knowledge and tools means that the capacity to manipulate organisms will become progressively easier to implement and available to more and more people. Today, many graduate students in the life sciences at leading universities can modify organisms and so change their function or develop novel synthetic organisms. As the techniques become more refined, these capacities will be deployed in high school science projects and available to tens of thousands of people who can learn the essentials with a focused review of information available on the internet.",

Large cities, especially those in low-income countries are ill-prepared for major disruptions. The exponential growth of cities in the global south is unprecedented. The populations of Mumbai, Dhaka, Delhi, Kinshasa, Kolkata, Lagos and Karachi each had populations <10 million people in 1990 but are now each projected to exceed 30 million people by 2050 (Hoornweg and Pope 2017). Throughout the global south, municipal governments exert limited influence on planning (Kombe 2005; Zebardast 2006; Narae 2014). Instead, these massive expansions are driven by real estate interests and firm level and household level economic decisions. Essential services to the population of the cities including water, electricity and transport are characteristically marginal, especially to residents of the poorest communities in the cities (Sverdlik 2011; Habitat 2015). The poor are already paying on average 10\u2013100 times more per liter of water than the wealthy (McIntosh 2003; Segerfeldt 2005). Many children living in poor urban communities face chronic malnutrition from poor diets (Fotso 2006).

When a new strain of influenza H1N1 was identified in Mexico in April 2009 and was thought to represent a major pandemic risk, vaccine development was prioritized. The first vaccine to protect against this new strain was licensed five months later. By December, eight months after identification of the new pathogen, a total of 534 million doses of vaccine had been manufactured (Partridge and Kieny 2010) that after the weeks or months required to implement vaccination campaigns would be sufficient vaccine to immunize 8% of the world population. By contrast, by December 2009 human cases of H1N1 were already confirmed in 208 countries, overseas territories and communities (Girard et al. 2010). Based on extrapolation of observed transmission patterns, between 25 and 39% of the world\u2019s population was infected within the first year (Girard et al. 2010).

A farmer does not know that the market for wheat in the coming season will be sufficient to recover his investment, nor can he be sure that the temperature and rainfall patterns will support a good yield. However, he can draw upon his prior experience to project likely scenarios for the upcoming season and so decide on prudent investments. People are generally able to plan for and mitigate risks of high-impact, low-probability events so long as the risk is well understood. Flood and fire insurance, for example, is commonly purchased despite floods and fires being unlikely.

Even professionals who make forecasts are unable to overcome these inherent epistemological difficulties. Indeed, professional forecasts of complex phenomena, for example, the performance of individual stocks in the stock market, the direction of the global economy, the outcome of sporting matches or of political events are notoriously unreliable (Torngren and Montgomery 2004; Andersson et al. 2005; Tetlock 2017).

Examples of such zoonotic pathogens include human immunodeficiency virus, tuberculosis, measles, smallpox and plague (Wolfe et al. 2007). In rural communities in low-income countries, people live in close contact both with their domestic animals (Sultana et al. 2012; Gondwe and Wollny 2007; Nahar et al. 2013) and with wildlife (Friant et al. 2015; Brashares et al. 2011). Population expansion in low-income countries is increasing exposure to wild animals and their pathogens with zoonotic potential (Weiss and McMichael 2004). The biological safety measures that are in place in high-income countries to reduce the risk of zoonotic spillover to industrial agricultural producers are not affordable to low-income agricultural producers (Rimi et al. 2017). Educational efforts designed to encourage low-income producers to expend their time and money to reduce pandemic biosecurity risks in their animal husbandry practices have generally failed (Paul et al. 2013; Manabe et al. 2012; Barennes et al. 2010; Rimi et al. 2016). For a low-income producer who is striving to provide a subsistence lifestyle to his/her family, time is preferably invested into activities that provide immediate improvements to family likelihood, rather than into abstract considerations regarding mitigation of global pandemic risk (Sultana et al. 2012).",

Structured observations in three hospitals in Bangladesh counted a mean of 3.7 people per 10 m (Hays 2005) of floor space who generated a median of 4.9 uncovered coughs or sneezes per hour (Rimi et al. 2014). The crowding of susceptible people within these overwhelmed institutions provides opportunities for the spread of a new pathogen. A dangerous novel pathogen might otherwise never achieve sustained transmission because of the exhaustion of susceptible hosts, but in an environment enriched with densely situated highly susceptible hosts, the pathogen has more opportunity to transmit and to spend more time in human hosts, that is an environment that exerts selective pressure for traits that improve the efficiency of person-to-person transmission (Antia et al. 2003).",

Although there are substantive financial barriers to improving the situation, poor accountability and the structure of incentives within health care institutions in low-income countries, especially public health care institutions, represent an even more formidable barrier (Lewis and Gelander 2009). In most low-income countries, government salaries are low compared to employment in the private or NGO sector (McCoy et al. 2008). Officials in government health care institutions commonly use their positions to extract funds from patients (Roenen et al. 1997; Andaleeb 1998; Thappa and Gupta 2014; Nordberg 2008). Budgets for supplies and disposables in these institutions often never reach the facilities (Nordberg 2008). Supplies that do come to hospitals are routinely commandeered by hospital personnel and transferred to their own private clinics or sold on the open market (Lewis and Gelander 2009; Killingsworth et al. 1999; Gray-Molina et al. 2001; Ferrinho et al. 2004). Government health care workers are frequently absent (Lewis and Gelander 2009; Garc\u00eda-Prado and Chawla 2006; Belita et al. 2013; Chaudhury et al. 2006).",

The large and growing human population has appropriated an unprecedented proportion of the biological output of the planet for food production (Krausmann et al. 2013). Over half of the world\u2019s population lives in cities and this proportion is projected to increase (United Nations 2016). Nearly, all of the food to support these urban residents is grown outside of cities (Zezza and Tasciotti 2010). This food production requires ongoing biological, agricultural and economic activity. Indeed, the global stocks of grain are only sufficient to meet 20% of annual human food consumption (Lilliston and Ranallo 2012). Thus, a functioning transportation system and system of economic exchange are essential to avoid food shortages, panic and widespread starvation. If an infectious pathogen that is transmitted from person to person generated a high risk of human mortality, in addition to systematic impairment from disabled workers, fear magnified by the mass media (Altheide 1997) could undermine the basic trust and social cohesion that undergirds movements of goods and economic exchange. The enormous needs for foodstuffs in urban communities would rapidly exhaust existing stores, that if not promptly resupplied, would generate further fear, hunger, malnutrition, attendant infection disease and social disruption. Indeed, even if the precipitating epidemic affected less than 1% of the population, it\u2019s follow-on impacts risk catastrophe.",

            "text": "The marked increase in human population density and the growth in transportation networks of roads, container ships and airways linking the global population presents more rapid and robust pathways for infectious pathogens than humankind has previously faced (Ahmed et al. 2013; Kaluza et al. 2010; Tatem et al. 2006). Previously, with lower population densities, a new pathogen capable of causing a global pandemic may never have escaped the small human community where it first appeared. For example, consider Nipah virus that was listed in 2017 by the World Health Organization as a priority disease for research and development because of its potential to generate a public health emergency (World Health Organization 2017). The primary pathway of transmission of Nipah virus from Pteropus bats to humans in Bangladesh is contamination of date palm sap during harvest by Pteropus bats that are shedding virus, with people in rural communities drinking the harvested raw sap a few hours later (Luby et al. 2006; Hegde et al. 2016). Most people who are infected with Nipah virus die (Hossain et al. 2008). Some pass the infection on to other people (Chadha et al. 2006; Gurley et al. 2007). Nipah has not caused a pandemic because it does not transmit efficiently from person to person, though it remains a pandemic concern because of the risk that a new strain of Nipah virus may emerge that is more efficiently transmitted from person to person (Luby 2013). Although Nipah virus was first recognized in 1999 (Hsu et al. 2004), the wide distribution of this family of viruses among Pteropus bats (Hsu et al. 2004; Chua et al. 1999; Field et al. 2011; Wacharapluesadee et al. 2010) and related species (Drexler et al. 2009) and the lack of symptoms in infected bats (Halpin et al. 2011; Middleton et al. 2007) suggests that Nipah virus co-evolved with Pteropus bats and has been shed by these bats for millennia. People lived in the area of modern day Bangladesh and have harvested date palm sap for centuries (Blattner 1978). However, if a strain of Nipah virus that was efficiently transmitted from person to person spilled over from bats to residents of a remote village in the nineteenth century, even if most of the village residents became infected and died, because of difficult transportation between villages and so infrequent interpersonal contact between human settlements, the chain of transmission would likely stop. In the twenty-first century, by contrast, the progressive increase in human population density increases the probability that a potentially pandemic pathogen originating in one community will encounter a sufficiently dense network of human connectivity to support ongoing transmission.",

First, universities, researchers, journalists and funders should rank analyzing and defending against global catastrophic biological risks as important topics for serious consideration and so attract the creative, analytic and problem-solving skills of students, researchers, planners and implementers. Increasing the priority of such work will require addressing a number of psychological barriers including optimism and availability bias, as well as the reluctance to invest in interventional social science research. Vivid scenarios depicting the potential pathways and consequences of biological catastrophe may be helpful in overcoming these biases (Combs and Slovic 1979; Slovic et al. 2004; Gong et al. 2017; Trutnevyte et al. 2016). Identifying and addressing key research questions can both improve our understanding of risks and provide guidance on optimal actions in the face of these risks. Such a study should include how political economy incentives contribute to the failure to address these risks. These include the lack of attention to these concerns in the general public and so to politicians, the short-term focus of the majority of political action and the substantial institutional reorientation required to prioritize a prevention/resilience focus. Although these risks are biological, engaging them requires transcending the biological paradigm.",

By contrast, there are a number of non-medical countermeasures that could be quickly deployed and may be effective against a wide range of biological threats. For example, increasing the frequency of hand washing with soap or alcohol gel can reduce the transmission of a variety of infectious agents including influenza (Talaat et al. 2011), Nipah (Gurley et al. 2007) and SARS (Fung and Cairncross 2006). Prior research has identified several techniques that by creating an environment where it is easy to wash hands, that is where soap and water or alcohol gel is conveniently available and behavior change messaging is iteratively developed with the target population and responds to their perspectives and values, then intensive interpersonal communication markedly improves hand washing practices (Briscoe and Aboud 1982; Stanton and Clemens 1987; Langford et al. 2011).",

The evidence that these approaches reduce infection transmission has been variable. Although mathematical models suggest that travel bans could delay the introduction of an epidemic (Brownstein et al. 2006; Epstein et al. 2007), in practice travel bans have targeted places where the press has identified a novel threat, but infectious disease transmission generally outpaces our capacity to detect it. In addition, interrupting travel threatens the global trade system that supplies critical food, medicine and energy to communities globally. Similarly, most studies find that school closures moderately reduce influenza transmission (Cauchemez et al. 2008; Jackson et al. 2013), but the effect is heterogeneous and may or may not apply to a novel biological threat. It would be helpful to further develop our scientific understanding of what measures can be taken that are effective in reducing infectious disease transmission. These approaches can be rigorously evaluated and their impact assessed in less than catastrophic outbreaks to guide the development of sound, rapid implementable responses to larger crises.",

            "text": "Developing and evaluating sustainable strategies to reduce the transmission risk of dangerous agents in healthcare facilities in low-income countries is an under-explored area of research that, with attention, is likely to identify strategies to reduce risk. Political scientists have developed thoughtful conceptual models of impaired governance and corruption in weak states (Migdal 1988; B\u00f6rzel and Risse 2010). Advocates for health care system reform have specifically analyzed governance barriers and suggested strategies for addressing these barriers (Lewis and Gelander 2009). There is an increasing empirical literature of intervention trials to improve governance generally (Humphreys and Weinstein 2009) as well as improving governance in the health sector (Gaitonde et al. 2016). Because poor governance and corruption are characteristically tied to long-standing historical developments and political and social tensions (Migdal 1988; Coovadia et al. 2009) they are unlikely to be resolved with a simple quick fix. Interventions to reduce pathogen transmission in these low-income weak state contexts are likely to look quite different from interventions in high-income countries that function within a different model for staff compensation, different institutional norms and regulatory agencies capable of enforcement. Indeed, we should expect approaches that work fine in a high resourced context would almost certainly fail in this quite different context. A research effort that explores the heterogeneity of practices and capacity for prevention of healthcare-associated infection in low resource settings and identifies the specific dimensions associated with increased and decreased risk could identify insights and approaches that would inform a more realistic approach to interventions to reduce risk. Generating useful new knowledge and approaches in reducing healthcare-associated infections in low-income health care facilities will require both funders and researchers to think beyond the paradigm of biomedical science, to an approach that is informed by political science, health system and infection control literature and rooted in empirical studies in these contexts.",

Although development policy usually assumes that connection with the broader world will bring benefit, both these communities and the human future might be better served by a less complete connection. Remote mountain communities may be the best locations to preserve separation. Similarly, a heterogeneous food supply would be more resilient in the face of biological catastrophe in contrast to a globalized monoculture where each individual crop is cultivated in a setting that optimizes yields, but also requires an uninterrupted just-in-time delivery system to provide calories and essential nutrients to populations globally. Diverse local foods would provide some resilience against interruptions in international trade that could accompany global biological catastrophe. A wider variety of cultivars would make the global food supply less susceptible to a devastating plant pathogen. Policies that support urban agriculture can further contribute to resilience (De Bon et al. 2010).",

Nassim Taleb asserts that if an economist was in charge of designing the human body, he would include only one kidney (Taleb 2007). What is the use of expending resources on a second kidney that most people would never need? Natural selection, however, has favored both efficiency and resilience. To protect against global catastrophic biological threats, societies should invest in resilience. A resilience framing accepts that extreme events will occur and prioritizes strategies to limit the loss and prevent spiraling knock-on effects. Resilience planning should occur at multiple levels and take several forms. Strategies to provide essential food, water and power in the event of severe disruption lasting weeks or months should be a standard consideration of city authorities. Distributed systems that provide power, water and food are less susceptible to cataclysmic point failure than completely centralized systems (Perrow 1999). Within growing populations especially in informal settlements in low-income country cities and with progressive per capita availability of freshwater, decentralized approaches that leverage local resources to provide safe drinking water and reduce environmental contamination are being deployed at several sites (Massoud et al. 2009). Urban gardens and urban farms can improve the resilience of neighborhoods and cities. Such distributed systems are increasingly efficient and are being adopted in many contexts (Guerrero et al. 2010).",

The entire fields of risk assessment, public health and global security planning assume that we can address the difficult, seemingly intractable problem. Smallpox used to kill millions each year (Hays 2005). A focused effort to understand and counter this risk eradicated smallpox (Fenner et al. 1988). Chlorofluorocarbons were depleting the earth\u2019s atmospheric ozone and the benefit this provides in protecting the earth against ultraviolet light (Molina and Rowland 1974). Scientific understanding of the risk and collective human effort produced less damaging alternatives to chlorofluorocarbons. An international treaty to control the use of chlorofluorocarbons resulted in the near elimination of the use of chlorofluorocarbons and progressive recovery in the ozone layer (Newman et al. 2009). In short, human history has demonstrated that apparently overwhelming risks can be successfully engaged and reversed. Similarly, the potential catastrophic risks considered here are not insoluble. They can be addressed through research, careful consideration of broad social factors, informed public dialog and thoughtful intervention.",
