Across all areas, a variety of technologies and hybrid devices have been extensively reported, indicating the rapid improvement and spread of the point-of-care (POC) analysis. To this end, it is now possible to perform rapid, efficient, inexpensive, and easy analyses almost anywhere and at any time [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9]]. Over the past few decades, lateral flow immunoassay strips (LFIS) have become an increasingly popular diagnostic tool for use in POCT because of their use-friendliness, rapidity, inexpensive nature, and specificity [[10], [11], [12], [13], [14]]. Currently, LFIS are considered to be one of the easiest methods to commercialize for use as a POC diagnostic tool.",

However, classic AuNPs-LFIS detection uses the naked eye, only providing a \u201cyes/no\u203f result. If quantitative analysis is needed, professional image analysis software and commercial instruments would be required. This limits the wide application of AuNPs-LFIS in homes or in on-site testing in resource-poor areas [24]. Therefore, a simple, inexpensive, user friendly, and pocket-sized reader would be an extremely useful tool to further advance the usability of the AuNPs-LFIS analytic technique.",

            "text": "Over the past decade, mobile phones have seen rapid development and gained ever-increasing levels of computational power. Globally, there are more than 5 billion mobile phone subscriptions, which is largely due to their ease of use and wide functionality. Critically, this popularity provides a development opportunity for their use in portable detection [25,26]. Due to their multifunctional capacities (e.g. permanent, built-in physical sensors, multi-core processors, digital cameras, USB ports, audio jacks, wireless transmission devices, and application software), smartphones have potential application in a wide variety of biosensor platforms [27,28]. In addition, the wireless telecommunication technologies incorporated within them allows for data upload to the internet. This could then help establish a ubiquitous platform for real-time, on-site monitoring [29]. Given this, coupling smartphones with LFIS could provide a portable, equipment-free, rapid, low-cost, and user-friendly POCT platform. To this end, Mudanyali et al. designed a cellphone-based reader platform that could work with various LFISs and get instrument similar tests to sense the presence of target analyte in samples. This platform could detect malaria, tuberculosis and HIV RDTs by installing it on both Android-based smartphones and iPhones [30]. Ling et al. reported a lateral flow-through strip for use with a smartphone camera that could quantitatively detect alkaline phosphatase activity in milk [31]. Hou et al. developed a smartphone-based, dual-modality imaging system that quantitatively detected either color or fluorescent LFIS [32]. In previous reports, smartphone-based LFIS readers were used directly with smartphone cameras to capture images of the LFIS test results. The data from these images were digitally processed using software. However, this approach has limits to its accuracy, resulting from the different pixilation and focal lengths between different smartphone\u2019s cameras. To this end, the ambient light sensor on a given smartphone is sensitive and accurate and offers a more consistent starting point to develop a biosensor readout system. A microplate reader based on smartphone\u2019s ambient light sensor to measures transmitted light intensities of liquid assay have been developed in our laboratory [[33], [34], [35], [36]]. The results were consistent with those obtained from a professional microplate reader and demonstrated its potential use in a variety of detection strategies for different targets.",

The analytical system comprised a smartphone with ambient light sensor and an accessory (height 42 mm; width 30 mm; length 66 mm; weight 30 g) made by a 3D-printer. The principle behind this approach is as follows: (1) AuNPs accumulate at the testing zone positions, which decrease light transmittance through the NC membrane. (2) When the reader's switch is opened, the light emitted from the light-emitting diode (LED) projects over the testing zone positions and is then recorded by the ambient light sensor. (3) The light intensity signal is displayed on the smartphone\u2019s screen using an app specifically designed to measure illuminance. (4) Light intensity relies on the degree of AuNPs coloration, AuNPs coloration is dependent on the concentration of the measured substance. Given this relationship, the light transmittance intensity can be used to directly quantify the tested sample (Fig. 1\n). We then analyzed three different analytes (cadmium ion (Cd2+), clenbuterol (CL), and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV)) to validate our newly developed smartphone-based colloidal gold LFIS reader. Readout results were consistent with those obtained from traditional approaches, demonstrating that our smartphone based-reader could accurately quantify AuNPs-LFIS.",

Here, we chose an Android-based phone as the baseline smartphone for fabricating the reader.

The attachment module included the LED, batteries, resistors, switch, wires, and a 3D-printed structure (Fig. 2b). LED wavelengths were specifically matched with the maximum absorption spectra of the AuNPs. The resistor (30,000 \u03a9) was used to regulate the intensity of the excitation light. Three batteries (3 V) was used to power the LED. The switch allowed the reader to turn on and off while the wires were used to connect all of the electronic components. The 3D-printed accessory held two light transparent holes of 2 mm diameter: The top hole was connected to the LFIS\u2019s light transparent hole, the following hole was connected to the ambient light sensor.

AuNPs-colored bands were formed since the label accumulated at specific positions on the NC membrane. The degree of the analyte concentration was then displayed as its corresponding color intensity. AuNPs have specific optical properties; as such, AuNPs color can decrease light transmittance through the NC membrane. When the LFIS assay was completed, the LFIS was put into the SPALS-based LFIS reader. The reader\u2019s switch was opened and the light emitted by the LED was projected over the NC membrane. This was then measured by the ambient light sensor of the smartphone.

Cadmium (Cd2+) and clenbuterol (CL) have been important testing targets for both environmental pollutants and food safety, respectively. As established by the World Health Organization (WHO), the maximum contaminant level (MCL) for Cd2+ in drinking water is 3 ng/mL [38,39]. Detecting Cd2+ in either drinking water or agricultural irrigation water has been shown to be a very effective way to reduce cadmium pollution. Clenbuterol (CL) is a synthesized \u03b22-agonist/antagonist and is used to promote animal growth and decrease fat synthesis.

The results from these two methods are shown in Fi. 6a and 6b. The image analysis system enabled discrimination of PEDV over a linear range of 0.078\u201320 \u03bcg/mL with a LOD of 0.062 \u03bcg/mL. The linear detection range for CL-LIFS using the SPALS-based reader was 0.078\u201320 \u03bcg/mL with a LOD of 0.055 \u03bcg/mL. As shown in Fig. 6\nc, the results from these two methods had good agreement. The swine faecal samples were then spiked with different concentrations of PEDV and detected using the PEDV-LFIS. These results were then measured using the SPALS-based reader (Fig. 6d). Taken together, these results demonstrate the feasibility of using our smartphone reader in clinical samples.",

            "text": "In summary, we have development a novel SPALS-based detection device that can quantitatively read colloidal gold lateral flow immunoassay strips (AuNPs-LFIS). We illustrated the performance of the SPALS-based AuNPs-LFIS reader by quantifying the detected AuNPs concentrations on the NC membrane. First, the linearity results for the AuNP quantification showed good correlation (R2 = 0.992) between transmitted light intensity analysis and the image analysis, indicating the device was validated with good sensitivity and stability. In addition, our technological evaluation analyzed three types AuNPs-LFIS and showed good agreement between the SPALS-based AuNPs-LFIS reader and the traditional image analysis method (Table S5). Additional evaluation the device with spiked samples revealed excellent recovery rates (Table S2,3 and 4). Compared with the conventional analysis system, our reading system has following advantages: 1) our reader operated more easily, the result could be directly obtained did not required additional data analysis; 2) our approach can be implemented on different smartphones and would only require an adjustment to the size of the holder slot for better fixation of the accessory; 3) our device is favored since ambient sensors do not require a focal adjustment; 4) the ambient light sensors do not require a large dark field, thus minimizing the size of accessory (height 42 mm; width 30 mm; length 66 mm; weight 30 g), even it can be put it in pocket; 5) our device doesn\u2019t require expensive optical component to improve the performance of the sensor, thus the production cost of the instrument are cheaper (about 1.3 $, Table S1). Taken together, our new smartphone-based device provides a quantitative analysis tool for AuNPs-LFIS and enhances the applied range of AuNPs-LFIS. This approach will have wide-ranging applications prospect s, including in environmental testing, public health monitoring, and disease prevention. In future studies, to reduce fabrication difficulty of the LFIS, more advanced materials and manufactures is essential, such as transparent bottom board. On the side, a higher resolution smartphone application should be used to improve the accuracy and stability of SPALS-based detection device.",
