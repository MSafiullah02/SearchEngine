            "text": "High-fat diet (HFD) is a predisposing factor for metabolic syndrome-related systemic inflammation and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, there is still no effective therapeutic treatment for NAFLD. Here, we showed that remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734), as a broad-spectrum antiviral nucleotide prodrug with anti-inflammatory effects, was effective for attenuating HFD-induced metabolic disorder and insulin resistance. Results revealed that the liver weight, hepatic dysfunction and lipid accumulation were markedly increased compared with that of the Control group, while that of the RDV group exhibited significant reduction, accompanied by the improved signaling pathway regulating fatty acid metabolism. In agreement with reduced lipid deposition, RDV supplementation suppressed the systematic and hepatic inflammation, as evidenced by reduction of inflammatory cytokines and the blockage of nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) signaling. In addition, stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and its down-streaming factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) were greatly increased in livers of HFD-fed mice, which were considerably restrained by RDV treatment. The in vitro analysis suggested that RDV functioned as an inhibitor of STING, contributing to the suppression of dyslipidemia and inflammation induced by palmitate (PA). However, PA-triggered lipid deposition and inflammatory response was further accelerated in hepatocytes with STING over-expression. Notably, RDV-attenuated lipid disorder and inflammation were significantly abrogated by the over-expression of STING in PA-stimulated hepatocytes. Taken together, these findings indicated that RDV exhibited protective effects against NAFLD development mainly through repressing STING signaling, and thus could be considered as a potential therapeutic strategy.",

            "text": "Increasing evidence demonstrates that excessive intake of fat is related to the risk of developing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) among humans and animals [1] . NAFLD is a stressassociated hepatic injury and metabolic disorder featured by diffuse hepatic steatosis and triglyceride accumulation, leading to simple fatty liver, steatohepatitis, and even cirrhosis [2] . The occurrence and progression of NAFLD can be linked to some essential factors, such as lipid deposition, inflammatory factors and oxidative stress [3] . During the past decade, accumulating studies have validated a critical role of innate immunity in the progression of hepatic steatosis [4] . Stimulator of interferon genes (STING), also known as Transmembrane protein 173 (TMEM173), is a signaling molecule, and its activation induces powerful type I interferon (IFN) immunity [5] . In response to viral infection, aberrant doublestranded DNA presents in cytosol and stimulates cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) synthase to produce cGAMP. The latter activates STING and then recruits STING to TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), activating the down-streaming signals including IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) to subsequently promote the expression of type I IFN genes [6, 7] . The importance of TBK1 activation regulated by STING signaling due to metabolic stresses has been reported during NAFLD progression [8] . Given the importance of STING in inflammatory response and NAFLD, we supposed that it might be a potential therapeutic target for developing effective treatments against NAFLD.",

Therefore, ORL was used as a positive control in our study. We found that RDV supplementation could effectively ameliorate HFD-induced metabolic disorder and insulin resistance in mice.

Moreover, fasting blood glucose level and insulin level were highly increased by HFD, while being attenuated by RDV, along with significantly reduced HOMA-IR (Fig. 1GeI) . OGTT and ITT showed the insulin resistance in HFD-fed mice, and RDV effectively ameliorated insulin resistance and helped to keep blood glucose stability compared to the HFD group (Fig. 1J) . Finally, we found higher serum endotoxin in HFDfed mice than that of the Con group, whereas being decreased in mice co-treated with HFD (Fig. 1K) . These findings demonstrated that RDV exhibited protective effects against HFD-induced metabolic syndrome.",

Oil Red O staining validated the role of RDV in reducing lipid deposition in hepatocytes induced by PA, which was similar with the results caused by siSTING. These findings were accompanied by the decreased expression of SREBF1, FASN, SCD1 and CD36, and the increased PPARa, CPT1a and ACOX1 ( Fig. 4B and C) . Moreover, both RDV and siSTING reduced the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokine in PA-stimulated hepatocytes (Fig. 4D) .

Then, we over-expressed STING in the isolated hepatocytes (Fig. 4F) . Notably, STING over-expression promoted lipid accumulation in PA-treated hepatocytes, and RDV-attenuated dyslipidemia was markedly abrogated by STING over-expression ( Fig. 4G and H) .

RDV was reported to improve pulmonary function or severe lung pathology by reducing immune cell infiltration and inflammatory response [10e12]. STING is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-membrane protein, and is essential in regulating innate immune signaling [6] . STING links up-streaming DNA sensors to down-streaming IRF3 and NF-kB pathway activation to subsequently induce the expression of type I interferon such as IFN-a and IFN-b, which leads to a potent anti-viral condition [20, 21] . STING is expressed in various tissues or organs, and the STING activation could result in cell metabolic disorders in an autoimmune or auto-inflammatory disease animal model [22, 23] . STING is also a trans-membrane protein, known as a key signal in the cytoplasmic DNA-TBK1-IRF3 pathway [24] . Furthermore, STING could activate the NF-kB signaling through promoting TBK1 [25] . Then, the activated IRF3 and NF-kB could enter the nucleus and induce the expression of IFNs and pro-inflammatory factors including IL-18, IL-6, IL-1b and TNF-a [26] . The synergy between IRF3 and NF-kB in inflammation has been demonstrated before [27] . It has been widely demonstrated that chronic hepatic inflammation aggravates insulin resistance and hyperglycemia, further contributing to the progression of NAFLD [28] . Thus, inflammation suppression could be involved in the treatment of fatty liver. Recently, STING expression was reported to be upregulated during NAFLD progression, which enhanced macrophage-regulated hepatic inflammation [29] . Here in our study, we confirmed that inflammatory response was involved in NAFLD development, as evidenced by the remarkably increased expression of IL-18, IL-6, IL-1b, TNF-a and CXCL-10, which was, however, evidently reversed by RDV treatment. Therefore, RDV had anti-inflammatory effects, which were validated in PA-and LPSincubated Kupffer and hepatocytes. In addition, RDV-ameliorated inflammation was accompanied with the suppression of STING, as well as its down-streaming signals, including the phospho-TBK1, phospho-IRF3 and IFNb. STING signal then activated NF-kB, promoting increases of inflammatory factors in NAFLD. Importantly, the in vitro results demonstrated that STING over-expression could further aggravate PA-induced inflammatory response in hepatocytes. At the same time, RDV-hindered inflammation and activation of TBK1/IRF3/NF-kB signaling was dramatically abrogated by STING over-expression in PA-exposed cells. All these findings demonstrated that RDV-restrained inflammation was largely dependent on STING expression.",

Meanwhile, STING over-expression diminished the protective effects of RDV on the lipid metabolism in PA-treated hepatocytes. Thus, inflammatory response regulated by STING was involved in RDV-ameliorated lipid metabolic disorders during fatty liver progression.",
