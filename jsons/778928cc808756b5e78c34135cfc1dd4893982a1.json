            "text": "The single most important respiratory pathogen in infancy and early childhood is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Approximately 40% of primary RSV infections in children result in lower respiratory tract disease. Approximately I% of RSVqnfected children require hospitalization. Especially in high-risk children, primary RSV infection results in significant morbidity and, sometimes, death. This high-risk group includes children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, children with congenital heart disease, premature infants less than 6 months of age, and children with immunodeficiency diseases. It has been estimated that, in the United States, 14,000 infants with chronic lung disease and 16,400 infants with heart disease will be identified by 12 months of age. More than 91,000 children are hospitalized annually with lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV, and 4500 deaths occur. In 1985 a report from the Institute of Medicine calculated that the annual hospitalization costs attributable to RSV infection were $300 million. Data collected at the New England Medical Center in 1991 show that the average cost of hospitalization of a child with RSV was $808 each day. Because of difficulty in developing a safe and effective RSV vaccine, attention is now focused on passive immunization using an RSV immune globulin. On the basis of a recently c o m p l e t e d multiinstitutional trial, RSV immune globulin appears to be a safe and cost-effective option for prevention of severe RSV disease in high-risk children.

            "text": "Viruses that account for the vast majority of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in infants and children include influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, coronaviruses, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus; RSV is the single most important respiratory pathogen in infancy and early childhood. I, 2 Asymptomatic carriage of RSV appears to be an infrequent occurrence. Approximately 60% of primary RSV infections are confined to the upper airways, with symptoms typical of the common cold. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is defined as a chronic lung disease of preterm ventilator-supported infants that is characterized by persistent respiratory distress, an oxygen requirement continuing beyond the first month of life, and radiographic abnormalities. A recent study by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Network estimated that BPD develops in 26% of all low birth weight (<1500 gm) ventilator-supported infants born in the United States, resulting in about 11,000 cases of BPD a year among the 4,200,000 infants born each year in the United States. 5 The number of infants with a birth weight >1500 gm in whom BPD develops may increase this number to a total of approximately 14,000 cases of BPD per year. Among infants and children with BPD, viral LRTI is the most common reason for rehospitalization after initial hospital discharge. A prospective study of the natural history of RSV infection in children with BPD by Groothuis et al. 6 found that 53% of 30 infants in a home oxygen program acquired RSV infection during a single 4-month respiratory virus season. Hospitalization was required for 11 (69%) of the 16 RSV-infected infants. Of the 11 hospitalized infants, 7 were hospitalized for more than 7 days, 4 were admitted to the intensive care unit, and 2 required mechanical ventilation. A recent report from Canada 7 reviewed a 3-year experience in 12 pediatric tertiary care centers with 1504 high-risk infants and children hospitalized with RSV infection. Of 200 pediatric patients hospitalized with chronic lung disease and RSV disease, 80% required supplemental oxygen, 32% required intensive care, and 19% required mechanical ventilation. Seven (3.5%) died within 2 weeks of admission, despite ribavirin therapy. Both of these studies emphasize the potential severity of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV infection in infants and young children with preexisting lung disease.",

Although bacterial infections constitute an important cause of acute pulmonary exacerbations in this population, patients with CF are at increased risk of hospi-talization for acute respiratory virus infection. A study by Abman et al. 9 prospectively followed 48 infants in whom CF was diagnosed in a newborn screening program. Of the 48 infants, 27% were hospitalized for acute respiratory distress before reaching 12 months of age. RSV was isolated from 7 of the 12 hospitalized infants during this 12-month period. The mean duration of hospitalization was 22 days, and 3 infants required mechanical ventilator support. At a mean follow-up age of 26 months, the infants with CF who had been hospitalized with RSV had significantly worse chronic respiratory symptoms than patients with CF who were not hospitalized early in life because of RSV infection. Whether severe RSV LRTIs contribute to the rapid progression of chronic changes in the lung s of patients with CF or whether RSV tends to be more severe in certain patients with CF who will have more extensive pulmonary involvement is not known. Either explanation, however, recognizes that RSV infection in a young patient with CF places the infant at increased risk.",

Of 73 infants with CHD, 27 (37%) had RSV infection. RSV-infected infants with CHD required more days of intensive care (63% vs 14%) and were more likely to require mechanical ventilation (22% vs 5%) than a control group of infants with RSV infection and no CHD. The mortality rate was 37% in RSV-infected infants with CHD, in contrast to 1.5% in the control patients. Overall, the mortality rate in infants with CHD without RSV infection was 6.5%, compared with a 37% mortality rate in children with both CHD and RSV infection--which emphasizes the importance of this pathogen as a cause of death in infants with CHD.

            "text": "Infants born at < 34 weeks of gestation, particularly those who are <6 months of age at the onset of RSV infection, constitute a third group of high-risk infants. A 9-year prospective study at the University of Rochester, 11 in New York State, found that 30% of children hospitalized with RSV LRTI had a history of prematurity. Even in the absence of lung disease, prematurity by itself constitutes a risk factor for hospitalization for RSV infection. This was demonstrated most recently in a report by Cunningham et a1.12 that prospectively compared a cohort of 133 survivors born at <33 weeks of gestation with a matched control group of term infants followed for 2 years to assess rates of rehospitalization for RSV infection. Thirty-six percent of all preterm infants (both with and without BPD) were rehospitalized at least once for respiratory illness, in comparison with 2.5% of 121 socioeconomically matched term infants. Twenty-five percent of the preterm infants without BPD were rehospitalized, compared with 45% of preterm infants with a history of BPD: As noted previously, only 2.5% of term infants were rehospitalized. Thus, in this study, preterm infants with BPD had the greatest risk of rehospitalization, although preterm infants with no history of BPD had a tenfold increase in rehospitalization rates compared with control infants. Infants discharged between September and December were approximately three times more likely to be rehospitalized than infants discharged between May and August, a reflection of the importance of respiratory viruses in precipitating readmission. In the previously described Canadian study, 7 24% of the 1584 hospitalized high-risk patients had prematurity as their only risk factor. Among those premature pediatric patients who had no chronic lung disease, heart disease, or immunodeficiency, the proportion of infants who were admitted to the intensive care unit and required mechanical ventilation was similar to that in other high-risk groups. Thus the degree of prematurity, a history of BPD, and the season of the year at time of discharge all influence the risk of rehospitalization for acute respiratory virus illness.",

In contrast, premature infants are likely to have a high incidence of RSV infection and severe RSV disease in the neonatal period, reflecting a lower titer of maternal neutralizing antibodies to RSV. 11 Hospitalized premature infants represent the population at greatest risk of nosocomial RSV infection. In comparison with symptoms in older infants, the symptoms of RSV infection in neonates are often nonspecific and without symptoms of lower respiratory tract disease. The risk of nosocomial RSV disease is a function of length of hospitalization for all groups and not just those with prematurity. 13",

In comparison with normal children, who shed RSV for an average of 7 days (range, I to 21 days), viral shedding for up to 6 months has been documented in HIV-infected infants. 16 A second study 17 found an increased risk of pneumonia and a 20% mortality rate for RSV infection in HIVinfected children. An interesting feature of RSV infection in HIV-infected children is the reduced likelihood of wheezing. Cell-mediated immunity, specifically the lymphoproliferative response to viral antigens, is believed to be important in the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis and wheezing. Dysfunction of this aspect of the immune response has been postulated as the explanation for the absence of wheezing.",
