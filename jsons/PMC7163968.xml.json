            "text": "Evolution shows remarkable examples of how living species adapt and survive in response to natural and environmental changes 1. All living organisms have evolved molecular mechanisms that enable them to quickly adapt to nutritional, chemical or physical alterations. These adaptations are induced by cascades of molecular events involving qualitative and quantitative changes in the basic, cellular macromolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids and lipids. Ultimately, these signalling events will trigger the appropriate response. One of the most common tools to induce a rapid change in the cellular environment is the post\u2010translational modification (PTM) of proteins by addition of chemical moieties, such as phosphate, acyl (most commonly methyl and acetate), small proteins or sugars 2. One highly conserved PTM system is the ADP\u2010ribosylation, the addition of ADP\u2010ribose (ADPr) groups from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to proteins 3 (Fig. 1). Interestingly, ADP\u2010ribosylation can happen not only on proteins but also on other macromolecules such as DNA, or small chemical groups 4, 5, 6, 7 (Fig. 1). The first discovered ADP\u2010ribosyltransferase (ART) enzymes were identified as bacterial toxins, such as the Cholera and Diphtheria toxins 7, 8. These toxins are released from bacterial pathogens to irreversibly modify host proteins to gain an advantage over the infected host 7, 8, 9. Later on, homologous transferases and modification\u2010reversing hydrolytic enzymes have been discovered in organisms from all kingdoms of life 3. Moreover, many recent observations show how viral genomes evolved the genetic tools that enable them to modulate ADP\u2010ribosylation signalling of infected cells 10, 11, 12, 13. ADP\u2010ribosylation seems to be particularly prominent in the highest organisms and it is best studied for the poly(ADP\u2010ribose) polymerase (PARP) superfamily of ART enzymes 3, 7, 14, 15, 16. Altogether, ADP\u2010ribosylation is a widespread modification that controls a vast number of cellular processes, including DNA damage repair, transcription, cell\u2010cycle progression, cell division, unfolded protein response, aging, nitrogen fixation, microbial pathogenicity, cell death and many others 7, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. However, our understanding of ADP\u2010ribosylation is still in its infancy, as can be seen from the current rapid rate of discoveries of previously unknown pathways regulated by ADP\u2010ribosylation.",

These proteins can be grouped into: (a) PARP\u2010like proteins, alternatively called Diphtheria toxin\u2010like ART (ARTD) superfamily; and (b) Cholera toxin\u2010like ART (ARTCs) superfamily.

The first and best characterized of these proteins was originally noted for its ability to synthesize ADPr polymers upon DNA damage and called poly(ADP\u2010ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) 15, 23, 26, 32, 33, 34. Human PARP1, PARP2 and Tankyrases (PARP5a and PARP5b), and close homologues from lower organisms and bacteria are able to produce long repeating chains of ADPr on target proteins 3, 7, 16, 23, 35, 36, 37. PARP1 and PARP2 can also catalyse the formation of branched chains of poly(ADP\u2010ribose) (PAR) on proteins and possibly DNA 6, 35. Most of the other characterized PARPs are mono(ADP\u2010ribosyl) transferases (monoARTs) 16, 24, 35. Another, highly diverged ART may also belong to PARP\u2010like proteins, but it transfers a phosphate group from RNA onto ADPr (Fig. 1). This is KptA/Tpt1 protein, RNA phosphotransferase found in all three domains of life 7, 38. In yeast, Tpt1 catalyses a NAD+\u2010dependent dephosphorylation of tRNA\u2010splicing intermediates, generating ADPr\u20101\u2010phopshate through a cyclic intermediate 38 (Fig. 1).",

Among the evolutionary widespread ADPr binding domains, the macrodomain has been studied the most extensively. Macrodomains are found in proteins from all kingdoms of life supporting different cellular processes 3, 16, 51, 52, 53, 54. Macrodomain\u2010containing proteins can recognize variety of substrates, including MARylated and PARylated proteins, different ADPr metabolites (such as OAADPr) 16, 53, 54, 55 and RNA 54, 56, 57 (Fig. 1).

Two evolutionary unrelated protein domains are known to support this catalytic activity: already mentioned macrodomains and the DraG\u2010like fold containing proteins 3, 67, 68. The catalytic macrodomain fold is found in a number of proteins coming from all the kingdoms of life 54. In humans four catalytic macrodomains have been identified: poly(ADP\u2010ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG), MacroD1, MacroD2 and terminal ADP\u2010ribosyl glycohydrolase 1 (TARG1/C6orf130) 16, 36, 54, 59, 69, 70. PARG efficiently cleaves the PAR\u2010specific O\u2010glycosidic ribose\u2013ribose bonds, however, it is unable to remove the terminal ADPr unit directly linked to a protein (Fig. 1) 36, 58. The existence of PARG\u2010splicing variants ensure the presence of the enzyme both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm or in membranous organelles 71, 72, 73 and allows for rapid turnover of PAR, ensuring tight control of this modification 66. The terminal ADPr moiety is removed by MARylation preferring hydrolases, such as MacroD1, MacroD2 or TARG1 58, 59, 69, 70 (Fig. 1). The latter enzymes can also hydrolyse some other ADPr metabolites, such as OAADPr 54, 55, 74 (Fig. 1). An additional macrodomain containing protein is Poa1p (YBR022) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, functionally characterized as a specific phosphatase that removes the phosphate group of ADPr\u20101\u2010phosphate in the tRNA\u2010splicing pathway in yeast 75.",

The functions of other PARPs are comparatively much less understood 27, 28. PARP4 (also called VPARP) is a component of the cytosolic ribonucleoprotein vault complex, however, its biological functions are unknown 104. PARPs 5a and 5b (tankyrases) are best understood for their roles in mitosis 19, 25 and Wnt signalling 105, 106, 107, 108, but they also have roles at telomere and DNA\u2010damage repair 108, 109, 110. PARP6 and PARP8 are poorly understood, however, PARP6 has been shown to be involved in hippocampus neuronal development 111. Several PARPs (PARP7 PARP10, PARP12 and PARP13) are involved in mechanisms of post\u2010transcriptional regulation of mRNA, mediated either by RNA\u2010binding domains 112 or by ADP\u2010ribosylation of RNA\u2010binding proteins 20.

Also, PARP9 and PARP14 are suggested to act on transcription, in particular of genes required for macrophage activation 117. PARP16 regulates the unfolded protein response 18.

In this respect, the progress has been additionally hampered in the case of poly(ADP\u2010ribosyl)ating PARPs, as the current methods to identify sites do not make the difference between mono and poly(ADP\u2010ribosyl)ation for specific amino acid position. Overall, acidic residues might be the main targets for most of the PARPs 35, 121, 122, 123, 124 but cysteine 35, 120, 123, arginine 121, 123, 124, lysine 83, 121, 123, 124 and serine residues 125 have been suggested as well. ADP\u2010ribosylation of acidic residues and lysines has been shown to be induced by oxidative stress 83. However, additional evidence has revealed that many of these lysine residues may have been mis\u2010annotated as modification sites, and that actual modification sites are proximal serine residues, that usually follow immediately after these lysine residues 126. Indeed, the KS motif has been identified as a preferred target for serine ADP\u2010ribosylation by several studies 125, 126, 127. Notably, serine ADP\u2010ribosylation seems to be specific for regulation of DNA damage response and other pathways important for genome stability such as regulation of chromatin structure, transcription and mitosis 127. HPF1/C4orf27 is the first protein identified acting as a specificity factor for the serine ADP\u2010ribosylation 127, 128.

Viral macrodomains bind ADPr and PAR and can perform activities characteristic for cellular macrodomains.

In addition to the MacroD\u2010type of macrodomains, a highly diverged macrodomain SUD\u2010M was found as a part of the nsP3 in SARS coronaviruses. This unique macrodomain binds nucleic acids, preferentially RNA, and is crucial for viral genome replication/transcription 164.
