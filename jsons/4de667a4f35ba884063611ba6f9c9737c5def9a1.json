Due to particular search conditions of caregivers and healthcare professionals (limited amount of time spent per patient), they are also in need of more sophisticated retrieval approaches applied to electronic health records [11] , a type of content highly challenging due to its telegraphic and domain specific language and the presence of negations and abbreviations. There is also interest in processing patient-generated content like social media and patient fora, a key resource for rare disease research, clinical trials patient selection/stratification or for discovering new patient-reported symptoms and treatment-related adverse effects. In the health-domain, indexing strategies relying on structured controlled vocabularies, like MeSH/DeCS or SNOMED CT, represent a critical component for efficient biomedical search engines, enabling query expansion and refinement [2] and the improvement of recommender systems [3] .",

Many structured controlled vocabularies are also available only in English [19] . Nonetheless, it is important to note that there is also a considerable amount of medically relevant content published in languages other than English and particularly clinical texts are entirely written in the native language of each country, with a few exceptions. The critical importance of semantic indexing with medical vocabularies motivated several-shared tasks in the past, in particular the BioASQ tracks 1 , with a considerable number of participants and impact in the field. Following the outline of previous medical indexing efforts, in particular the success of the BioASQ tracks centered on PubMed, the BioASQ MESINESP TASK 2 , supported by the Spanish National Language Technology plan (Plan TL), proposes to carry out the first task on semantic indexing of Spanish medical texts. This workshop will be a forum where the community can present and discuss current and future directions for the area based on the experience in participating at the MESINESP shared task or other medical IR, QA or text categorization evaluation campaigns, as well as the exploitation of evaluation settings and data collections generated through these kind of community evaluation efforts (both during and after the competition period).",
