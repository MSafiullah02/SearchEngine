An analysis of recommendations in guidelines produced by 10 countries was published in 2001.6 However, several guidelines included were not formal publications agreed upon nationally or subnationally and the analysis did not consider many aspects of their development and design that could be useful for the drafting of the WHO guidelines.",

Some were primarily intended as advisory directives,9, 13, 15, 16, 22, 23 whereas others focused on the technical issues of why, when, and how to perform hand hygiene.12, 17, 20, 26, 27, 28, 29 Developers of the \u2018advisory\u2019 type of document focused mainly on evidence gathering and making general recommendations applicable to different settings and areas. They also hinged more on specific issues related to implementation such as technical details, popularising practices, and logistics with some referring to companion materials for certain details, such as training guides and other national guidelines. Several guidelines contained a long, detailed text in addition to the evidence for recommendations.",

            "text": "The extent to which evidence was collected and assessed varied considerably. Only three guidelines described clearly the method used for collecting or selecting evidence.10, 13, 16 Seven national and two subnational guidelines graded the evidence for recommendations (Table I\n).11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 22, 23, 24, 26 However, different grading systems and definitions were used to indicate the strength of evidence and recommendations (Table I). The quality of evidence was based on expert consensus in three documents.11, 15, 22 The grading was performed using the methods adopted by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) for the EPIC (Evidence-based Practice in Infection Control) 2 guidelines.13 Published guidelines used as references were assessed using the AGREE (Appraisal of Guidelines' Research and Evaluation) instrument in one document.13 There were additional differences in the individual statements defining the grade hierarchy. For example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Category 1A is \u2018strongly recommended for implementation and strongly supported by well-designed experimental, clinical or epidemiological studies\u2019, while the France Category 1 is \u2018strongly supported by well-designed studies and does not pose economical or technical problems\u2019. In the EPIC 2 guidelines, evidence grades 1 and 2 were further classified into three (i.e. 1, 1+, and 1++). In general, there were three to five grades of evidence and recommendations. The quantum of evidence and details of data from studies presented varied considerably. This probably reflects differences in the evidence-gathering and assessment process. Although the recommendations formulated in most documents were based on expert consensus, the validation process was often unclear. Only seven documents described internal or external peer review and public consultations as methods of validation.11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 22, 24\n",

For example, terms such as \u2018decontamination\u2019 and \u2018antisepsis\u2019 were used synonymously in different documents. The definition of terms used to classify situations where hand hygiene practices are indicated differed between documents. For example, in some cases, \u2018social\u2019 indications meant contacts other than patient care (between HCWs, casual social contact between patient and HCWs, etc.). In others, the same word was used to include all situations where plain soap and water were recommended as the method for hand cleansing, including visible soiling with blood and body fluids. Others did not classify indications, but merely provided lists. In the present evaluation, three types of indications for hand hygiene were considered: social (physical contact unrelated to patient care), patient care and surgical hand preparation. According to this classification, most guidelines appear to have focused on the latter two types of indication. Five guidelines, three national and two subnational, were developed primarily for routine patient care and had only social and routine patient-care indications.11, 13, 19, 25, 26\n",

It reflects also the numerous responses to the call for action to improve hand hygiene in healthcare launched in 2005 by the World Alliance for Patient Safety at both international and national levels.4 Despite this main common objective, wide variations in the scope, goals, content, breadth, and depth of topics covered were identified in hand hygiene guidelines. In addition, many documents did not provide a comprehensive coverage of some critical aspects related to proper guideline implementation and sustainability. Lack of uniformity in terminology further compounded analytical differences and often no glossary was provided, thus assuming that a healthcare worker understood the meaning of a certain term. It was not possible to find exhaustive explanations for these differences and deficiencies. Factors related to an often ill-defined, variable target audience, local constraints, and culture and local traditions might have influenced different approaches.",

This reflects the well-known lack of awareness that even the environment and patients' intact skin are contaminated by harmful pathogens that can be transmitted through hands.33, 34 Furthermore, recommendations in some guidelines were formulated in such a way that the healthcare worker had eventually to make his/her own decisions as to when and how to perform hand hygiene. In others, the recommendations were buried or even scattered throughout a large infection control manual. These factors certainly make it more difficult for healthcare workers to determine whether hand hygiene is a high priority and more difficult for policy-makers to develop and implement strategies to encourage and sustain hand hygiene improvements nationally or locally. Although we would have liked to analyse the structure and design of the guidelines and how they might have been influenced by their target population, it was often difficult to identify the latter. Most appear to be targeting the healthcare worker, but we could not always determine the setting or the possibility that other stakeholders were influencing the guideline details, such as politicians, policy-makers or even patient advocates.",

On the other hand, most guidelines recognised that multiple elements were essential for a successful implementation strategy, as repeatedly evidenced in the literature.36\n",

However, while the CDC guidelines are primarily intended for use in the USA and other Western countries, the WHO guidelines were conceived in a more global perspective and represent the challenge to bridge the gap between developing and developed countries, regardless of resources available. For example, instructions are included for the production of alcohol-based hand rubs locally and at low cost. Furthermore, a significant added value of the WHO guidelines is the fact that their feasibility has been tested in settings with different cultural backgrounds37 and development levels.38\n",

Thus, institutions in charge of producing and/or updating hand hygiene guidelines at country level will have the opportunity to take advantage of the regular revision of the WHO guidelines rather than making individual efforts. Furthermore, although the adaptation to the local setting and needs must be prioritised, the reference to an internationally acknowledged guideline can lead to a more standardised and rigorous approach which is currently lacking in most guidelines reviewed here. Indeed, the results of our analyses confirm the lack of uniformity of hand hygiene guidelines worldwide and the urgent need not only for practical and internationally accepted recommendations on many different aspects of hand hygiene, but also for guidance in implementing these recommendations. Despite these differences and the lack of accuracy in some cases, the existence of a growing number of guidelines on hand hygiene, most of which have been issued over the last eight years, represent the acknowledgement by countries of the importance to ensure patient safety and the firm intention to make significant progress in infection control worldwide.",
