A warehouse explosion on Aug 12, 2015, in Tianjin, a major port city in China, caused 158 deaths and 698 hospital admissions.1 Post-disaster investigations at the explosion site reported illegal storage of dangerous chemical substances comprising 1300 tonnes of oxide and nitrate compounds (mainly potassium nitrate and ammonium nitrate), 500 tonnes of flammable materials (consisting of metallic sodium and magnesium), and 700 tonnes of highly toxic substances (mainly sodium cyanide).2 In addition to the fatalities, injuries, and adverse mental health effects on survivors caused by the blast, release of chemical pollutants could cause immediate health risks such as burns, and toxic effects ranging from asphyxiation to neurotoxicity. Long-term environmental hazards in the air, soil, water, and food supply could affect the wellbeing of nearby residents for years to come.",

Disaster prevention and disaster risk reduction were major challenges in previous decades. Accidental industrial disasters, many of which took place in economic and heavy industrial areas between 1995 and 2005, generally affected poor and vulnerable people employed in high-risk occupations (eg, miners) with poor occupational safety protection.8, 9 Between 2005 and 2015, major industrial accidental disasters were often reported in urban, residential, middle-class communities, as well as in industrial, suburban communities. The fire and blast incident in Changchun City in Jilin Province (2013),10 the oil spill blast incident in Qingdao City in Shandong Province (2013), and the blast incident in Kunshan City in Jiangsu Province (2014) are examples of disasters in urban areas that each resulted in more than 100 casualties, affected thousands of inhabitants, and caused economic losses of millions of yuan. Likewise, patterns of mortality have changed from predominantly affecting industrial workers to disaster responders, such as firefighters and policemen.1 Such epidemiological patterns could be reduced by timely prosecution of people implicated in illegal industrial or commercial practices and by bridging gaps in disaster prevention knowledge, attitudes, and practices of industry, responders, and the community, where the adverse effects are most likely to be reported.",

Although clean-up operations are in progress and cofferdams have already been installed at the Tianjin blast sites,2 members of the public have expressed major concerns about further release of chemical pollutants. Despite these challenges, the Tianjin incident provides an important opportunity for China to improve its resilience by upgrading the training of emergency responders in handling specific disaster hazards, and educating the public about environmental health risks of chemical incidents. If the Chinese Government shows zero tolerance of illegal industrial practices and holds the relevant stakeholders accountable for such practices, the Tianjin incident could become a historical milestone for improvement of disaster risk reduction in China.",
