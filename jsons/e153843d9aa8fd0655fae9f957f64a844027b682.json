Matching scaffolds were individually reannotated using GeneWise (www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/psa/genewise/) and manually adjusted to introduce corrections into Athena RTs and associated ORF sequences, which were mostly misannotated due to the poor approximation of the C. elegans-trained gene models to TE-encoded ORFs. For the same reason, this procedure was also applied to genes of non-metazoan origin. The Sanger-sequenced A. vaga and P. roseola large-insert library clones were from Av_184A11, Av_119E19, Pr_152C9, Pr_313N6, PrTEL_IV_4, Pr_TEL_G (EU643486, EF485018, DQ138288, MF143428, EF485015, EF485006).

Sequence logos for multiple alignments with AlignmentViewer, prediction of coiled-coil motifs with COILS/PCOILS, and profile-profile homology searches with HHPRED were done using the MPI toolkit (Alva, et al. 2016) . HHR motif alignment was created with Boxshade 3.3.1. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis was done using the GTR+F+G model for nucleotide sequences and the WAG+F+G model for amino acid sequences, with a discrete gamma distribution used to model evolutionary rate differences across sites (G=5), and the resulting trees were edited in MEGA 7.0.18 (Kumar, et al. 2016) .
