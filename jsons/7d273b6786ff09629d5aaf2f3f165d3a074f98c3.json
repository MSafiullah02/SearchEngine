Background: Myocardial injury caused by COVID-19 was previously reported in hospitalized patients. It is unknown if there is sustained cardiac involvement after patients' recovery from COVID-19. Methods: Twenty-six recovered COVID-19 patients that reported cardiac symptoms and underwent MRI exams were retrospectively included. MRI protocols consisted of conventional sequences (cine, T2WI, LGE), and quantitative mapping sequences (T1, T2, and ECV mapping). Edema ratio and LGE were assessed in post-COVID-19 patients. Cardiac function, native T1/T2, and ECV were quantitatively evaluated and compared with controls. Results: Fifteen patients (58%) had abnormal MRI findings on conventional MRI sequences: myocardial edema was found in 14 (54%) patients and LGE was found in 8 (31%) patients. Decreased RV functional parameters including EF, CI, and SV/ BSA were found in patients with positive conventional MRI findings. Using quantitative mapping, global native T1, T2, and ECV were all found to be significantly elevated in patients with positive conventional MRI findings, compared to patients without positive findings and controls (median [IQR], native T1 1271ms [1243-1298] vs 1237ms [1216-1262] vs 1224ms [1217-1245]; mean [SD], T2 42.7ms [3.1] vs 38.1ms [2.4] vs 39.1ms [3.1]; median [IQR], 28.2% [24.8-36.2] vs 24.8% [23.1-25.4] vs 23.7% [22.2-25.2]; p=0.002, p <0.001, and p =0.002, respectively).",

A senior observer (LX, with 20 years' experience in MRI) adjudicated any discrepancies between two observers. For each patient, the endo-and epicardial contours of LGE images were manually delineated, and LGE lesion was defined as SI >5SD above the mean SI of the remote reference myocardium.

With both limitations, the reported proportion of cardiac involvement is limited to the present study and cannot be extrapolated to a larger population.

The majority of T2 signal hyperintensity was located in the interventricular septum, anterior, anterior-lateral, and inferior wall at base and mid-chamber. The location of edema caused by SARS-CoV-2 appeared different from those caused by acute viral myocarditis, which commonly involves inferior and inferior-lateral wall.(14,15) However, some recovered patients had subepicardialLGE lesions at inferior and inferior-lateral wall, similar to common types of viral myocarditis (inferior-lateral wall). (17) Pericardial involvement is a complication of myocardial damage, which was also found in a proportion of our cohort. Global T1, T2, and ECV values were significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients with positive conventional cardiac MRI findings, compared with patients without positive findings and healthy controls(Figure 2). Besides, elevated T1, T2 and ECV values were observed in the remote myocardium of LGE-positive patients, indicating diffuse involvement.
