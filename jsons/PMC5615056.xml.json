            "text": "In March 2009 a novel H1N1pdm influenza virus emerged in Mexico and started spreading globally1. The first cases in Europe, mainly travelers coming back from infected areas (Mexico and United States), were recorded at the end of April 20092. At the beginning of June 2009, more than 70 countries had been reached by the infection and the World Health Organization declared a pandemic. Because of the great attention that was paid to the pandemic threat, the surveillance of ILI cases was enhanced during the pandemic3 and several seroprevalence surveys were performed at different time points4\u20138. This made it possible to apply several mathematical models for epidemic spread to the available data, in order to make real-time predictions9\u201311 or to assess the most relevant factors for the observed patterns of spread12,13. The focus of the investigations was either on the national level or on specific epidemic hotspots14, and little has been ascertained about patterns of within-country epidemic spread (see however Gog et al.15 for the U.S. or Eggo et al.16 for the 1918 pandemic).",

In Europe, the pandemic progressed from West to East12,19, and about 66% of cases affecting European countries up to the end of June 2009 were reported in the United Kingdom20. Unlike all other European countries, which were characterized by moderate transmission in spring and summer and by a single fall/winter wave, in 2009, the UK experienced two waves, the first one in late spring/summer and the second one in the fall. The intensive air connections between the UK and the US and the late closure of schools for summer holidays have been identified as the main determinants of the first wave12,21. Data collected since 2009, together with modeling studies, have provided a clear picture of H1N1 epidemiology at the national and international scale. However, some notable patterns of spread at the sub-country level warrant further investigation. In particular, during the first wave of the pandemic, H1N1 cases were heterogeneously dispersed within England. The regions of London and West Midlands experienced early large school-based outbreaks22,23, and a more rapid increase of general practitioner (GP) consultation rates for influenza-like illness (ILI) with respect to the other regions2 - this evidence was later confirmed by a cross-sectional serological study4. On the contrary, the second wave spread in a much more homogeneous way, affecting most regions of England soon after the reopening of schools after the summer break5.",

In particular, the spatiotemporal spread of the pandemic could have been driven by several factors such as an increase of the transmissibility of the virus over the course of the epidemic, an increased number (or location) of the influenza cases arriving from abroad or variation in the behavior of the population. To test these (and other) hypotheses, we used previously published serological data at the regional level4,5 to perform a Bayesian analysis of dynamic models of influenza transmission.",

Specifically,\nM1 This model is based on the classic model introduced by Ferguson and colleagues25. Basically M1 differs from model by Ferguson and colleagues25 by three factors: M1 does not explicitly consider transmission in workplaces, it does not differentiate between symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious individuals, and it explicitly considers an age-specific susceptibility to infection. Model M1 has five parameters related to virus transmissibility and susceptibility to infection: three transmission rates (in households, schools and \u2018other settings\u2019), the relative susceptibility to infection of adults with respect to children, and one multiplying factor for the transmission in \u2018other settings\u2019 while schools are closed. These parameters are epidemic-specific and thus need to be calibrated on the basis of the observed data. M1 can be considered as a reference scenario for comparing the other tested models.Note that the model has a distance dependent component of the force of infection in \u2018other settings\u2019 that is driven by a kernel distance function \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$K(d)=1/\\mathrm{[1}+{(d/a)}^{\\alpha }]$$\\end{document}K(d)=1/[1+(d/a)\u03b1], where d is the geographic distance, a = 4 km and \u03b1 = 3 as determined by Ferguson and colleagues25 by analyzing commuting data for the UK. Basically, the kernel defines the distance at which an infectious individual generates secondary infections through contacts in \u2018other settings\u2019 (i.e., all contacts except those occurring in households and schools).\nM2 This model is structured exactly like model M1, except for the kernel function; here we estimate the parameter \u03b1 regulating K(d) (and set a = 1 km), hypothesizing that the mean distance of infections linked to the transmission in \u2018other settings\u2019 could have been different than what was estimated by Ferguson and colleagues25 from commuting data, possibly because of a spontaneous human response of the population to the pandemic threat (as previously documented for the 2003 SARS epidemic33), leading to a very high spatial localization of the first pandemic wave.\nM3 This model is like M2, but we let the virus transmissibility differ between the two waves by adding one free parameter regulating such a difference, either for climatic reasons or because of viral evolution, as shown by Dorigatti et al.13 for the \u2018third wave\u2019. Possibly an increase in infection transmissibility might have led to a quicker spread in the second wave and thus to a rather homogeneous seroprevalence by region.\nM4 This model is like M2, but we added one parameter regulating the daily number of imported cases that might have been larger during the second wave. Indeed, influenza incidence was much higher in the fall than in the spring both in the United States15 and in the other European countries34, the origins of most travelers to the United Kingdom. It is then plausible that the influx of infectives was higher during the second wave, when individual case reporting had already been discontinued3, and this in turn might have led to a more spatially homogeneous infection spread.\nM5 In this model, the parameter \u03b1 regulating the infection kernel K(d) in \u2018other settings\u2019 is allowed to differ between the first and the second wave. This might have occurred because the population behaved differently at the beginning of the pandemic from later on, and this could have led to different patterns of epidemic spread. For the rest, the model is identical to M2.\n",

In particular, the mean transmission distance in \u2018other settings\u2019 was estimated to have increased from 2.1 km (SD = 0.7) during the early epidemic phase to 10.0 km (SD = 29.1) later on.

If we consider the mean transmission distance irrespective of the setting where the infection occurs, estimates provided by model M5 become: 1.4 km (SD = 3.8) during the first wave, 5.3 km (SD = 20.7) during the second wave (Fig. 1b).\n",

Such a pattern is also clearly visible by looking at the dynamics of weekly and cumulative incidence at the resolution of single geographic cell (Fig. 3a,b and the Supplementary Video S1). Moreover, as shown in the Supplementary Video S1, it is apparent that the fall wave spread through the country in a remarkably more homogeneous way and at a higher pace than the summer one. These patterns are driven by the detected change in the transmission distance: a lower distance during the early phase corresponds to a lower rate of spatial diffusion of the infection, while the estimated larger value in subsequent phases corresponds to a quicker and much more homogeneous geographic spread.\n",

The differences between the models mainly lay in the factors driving the pattern of spread.

Specifically, we tested different hypotheses that could explain the observed highly localized spread during the first wave of the pandemic and the subsequent homogeneous diffusion during the second one. The mean transmission distance in settings other than households and schools has been estimated in all the analyzed models to be, during the first pandemic wave, remarkably lower (\u22482 km) than the mean commuting distance (\u224815 km). On the other hand, the model best reproducing the data highlights that such a distance increased substantially over the course of the pandemic (the estimated mean distance for the second pandemic wave was 10 km). In addition, our findings provide a clear picture of the epidemiology of the 2009 pandemic, in agreement with the existing knowledge. Children younger than 15 years were the most affected age group: other studies found that children have higher contact rates42,43 and a lack of pre-existing immunity4,5,8,44; here we also estimated a higher (about twice as much) susceptibility to infection compared with adults, similar to previous works on the 2009 H1N1 pandemic1,8,31. We estimated a relatively low value of the reproduction number (around 1.4) in both waves. We also provided quantitative estimates of the proportion of cases by setting that is crucial for determining the effectiveness of intervention options, such as school closure28,45,46, highlighting a major contribution of schools to the overall transmission. Consistent with serum sample data5, we estimated that London experienced a marked first wave, while other regions showed little evidence of a summer wave, and that the fall wave was lower in London than elsewhere.",

In particular, during the initial phase of the epidemic, when the attention of the public on the pandemic threat was higher, we found that infections were generated at a much closer distance than the average commuting distance. In the following phases, we estimate that the radius of diffusion of the epidemic became comparable with the distance traveled by commuters. A possible explanation for such a pattern lies in behavioral changes, spontaneously emerging as a response to the pandemic threat. During an emerging epidemic people may engage in precautionary behaviors that alter the transmission dynamics of the disease47,48. An initial overestimation of the risk of infection has been detected in Italy49 and Mexico50. Moreover, according to survey results51,52, in the case of an influenza pandemic a large proportion of people are willing to avoid crowded places, especially public transportation. For instance, a worker who usually commutes to reach his workplace, would likely continue to travel the same distance to reach the workplace even during a pandemic, but he might decide to avoid crowded environments near the workplace (such as pubs, and restaurants) where he usually goes outside business hours. Our findings suggest that in the early phase of the pandemic behavioral changes may have led to either a reduction of mobility in absolute terms or, more likely, to a decrease in the number of potentially infectious contacts at high distance from the place of residence/study.",

However, although our results point in the direction of a human behavioral adaptation to the pandemic threat, they are far from conclusive. In fact, other factors could have been responsible for the changes in the force of infection that we measured. Clearly, data quality (far from being flawless) and (un)availability impose several limitations on our modeling analysis. First, concerning the initial seeding of the infection, we compute the region-specific probability of importing cases by using data on the total volume of incoming passengers by airport, disregarding their origin and final destination. Second, our model neglects cross-border infections that, given the geographic features of England, may have been imported from Scotland or through the Channel Tunnel, i.e. from France and continental Europe. A further limitation of the model is that transmission in workplaces is not explicitly modeled; in fact, its contribution is included in the \u2018other settings\u2019 component of the force of infection. However, the contribution of workplaces during the 2009 pandemic has been shown to be marginal41. Finally, it should be remarked that describing infection transmission through a distance kernel neglects most details of human mobility, although it has been shown that it gives an adequate description, especially in a setting like that of the UK54.",
