At this point in time much remains unknown, and evidence-based guidance regarding bronchoscopy precautions and SARS-CoV-2 infection will require updating as new information becomes available. But as William Osler reflected, \u201cMedicine is a science of uncertainty and an art of probability.\u201d So even though there is much that is still uncertain, we need to act prudently in a timely manner rather than waiting for perfect information. The AABIP statement is an initial step in this process and it will be updated accordingly at the Web site of the AABIP (https://aabronchology.org/). Subsequent updates will also be reviewed and published in the Journal with free access to all in an expedited manner.",

Bronchoscopy is a tremendous tool for diagnosis and treatment of a variety of conditions, but it can also transmit disease if appropriate precautions are not followed. In the cases of SARS-CoV-2, there are risks to both patients and health care providers.

            "text": "There are also more nuanced aspects to the epidemiology that should impact how we think about bronchoscopy in the age of COVID-19. One way to characterize infectious epidemics is to calculate the basic reproduction number, also called the basic reproductive ratio (R0). R0 is not a rate, but rather a ratio. It is the ratio of the expected number of cases directly generated by a case in a population in which all members are susceptible to the infection.3 Note that this definition makes certain assumptions\u2014specifically that all members of the population are susceptible so R0 technically is not changed by interventions such as vaccination. This number attempts to quantify the potential for the transmissibility of an infectious agent. While R0 is a valid biological metric, the value itself is usually estimated with mathematical models that are in turn based on key assumptions, so interpretation of its value is complex and estimated values for the same pathogen can vary widely depending on the models used.4 While R0 is conceptually useful, the more relevant number is the effective reproduction ratio (R) which is different. This is the number of cases generated in the current population at a moment in time, but it does not assume complete susceptibility in the population. The effective reproduction ratio can change with vaccination. Both R0 and R are not solely determined by the pathogen, although the pathogen, of course, has a large impact. Other factors such as population density, behavior patterns, and interventions can change R. For most situations when R>1 the infection will be able to spread within a population, while if R<1 it will not be able to spread. Estimates of the median daily reproduction number in Wuhan declined from 2.35 before travel restrictions to 1.05 after travel restrictions.1 Other investigators have estimated R to be 2.2 (95% confidence interval: 1.4-3.9).1,5 Over time R will hopefully decrease as interventions take effect. In the prior severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic of 2003, R was estimated initially at 2.75 but with interventions, R dropped <1 rapidly.",

If a routine bronchoscopy patient (eg, for a lung nodule) is infected but asymptomatic and therefore remains undetected, then health care providers will be unprotected. Now, this is true in many areas of health care delivery, not just the bronchoscopy laboratory. But unlike other areas of health care, the act of bronchoscopy is likely to increase the probability of transmission to bronchoscopy personnel due to respiratory droplets. That same bronchoscopy personnel provide care to other particularly vulnerable patients every day, setting up a super-spreader situation since infected individuals have close contact with a particularly vulnerable population with frequent comorbidities, including cancer and immunosuppression.9,10 In addition, data is still scant on whether SARS-CoV-2 can survive outside the body for long. The coronavirus that caused Middle East respiratory syndrome demonstrated the ability to survive outside the body for up to 60 minutes. A report of a cluster of 19 cases in a shopping mall suggests that the virus might have spread via indirect transmission, but the evidence is not definitive at this time.11",

This, of course, is only possible once testing becomes more widely available such that all other higher priority patients can be tested. Another intervention is to consider delaying elective cases when possible. The available data suggests that for diagnosis and staging of cancer a brief delay could be implemented without much adverse impact.12 In the absence of widely available testing, one option would be to implement a 2-week delay combined with self-quarantine for elective cancer diagnosis and staging cases. Patients who remain asymptomatic would have their elective bronchoscopy. After a brief 2-week downtime, the daily flow of elective cancer cases would return to more normal levels so that delays in cancer care would not be excessive while balancing the need for containment of the pandemic. Which interventions to implement and when to implement them will be context-dependent, depending in large part on the prevalence of the disease in each locale and the available resources, so individualization to each particular hospital\u2019s context is important.",

Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the health care environment is always a concern because of the vulnerable population we serve.

This will require additional data collection and analysis as well as timely and prudent decision making that incorporates not only probabilities but consequences as well.
