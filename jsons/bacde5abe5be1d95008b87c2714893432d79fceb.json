At the epidemiological level, this information on how infectious someone is lies embedded implicitly in the serial interval data. Other clinical indicators of infectiousness based on the temporal kinetics of the viral shedding from the nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum show the former decaying weeks sooner than the latter. In this work, we attempt to provide a better quantitative estimate for the temporal infectiousness profile using serial interval data from a combined 1251 individuals reported in the literature. We show that the infectiousness profile which we calculate correlates well with the viral shedding kinetics from nasopharyngeal swabs (r=0.97, p=0.00) and culturability (r=0.83, p=0.01). The profile suggests that a 68.4% (95% CI: 67.0-69.7%) of the infections are caused by infections before the symptoms appear, which is a much stronger pre-symptomatic influence than what was predicted in the literature 44% (95% CI: 25-69%) using serial data from 77 individuals.",

The R0 of COVID-19, for which some of the estimates have been around 2.2 to 2.5, 1,2 is a regularly monitored parameter to see if the spread of the infection is contained. Going one step further into understanding the origins of R0, the spread of infections depends on the physical contact between the infected and the susceptible individuals, as well as on how long an infected person can infect others. A substantial amount of infections of COVID-19 are transmitted through asymptomatic individuals, 3 and their infectiousness profiles are harder to track. Here we specifically focus on the data from the symptomatic individuals to quantify their temporal infectiousness profile during the course of their personal history of infection.",

The cycle threshold (Ct) values from RT-PCR are converted to RNA copy numbers in the sample and interpreted. Several studies followed the temporal history of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding profiles in individuals for many weeks after the onset of symtpoms. [4] [5] [6] [7] Some of these studies showed that peak viral loads were higher for older individuals, 6 whereas, others on a larger cohort showed no significant differences in viral shedding with sex, age group, and the severity of the disease. 7 Despite this apparent commonality across the patient demographics, the viral shedding patterns from the different specimens show varying kinetics. While some reports show that the viral load from the nasal swabs showed much faster decay within about a week after the symptoms, compared to throat swabs, 4 other reports found no discernible differences. 8 Further, using sputum or stool analysis a significant number of patients are considered positive for 3 to 4 weeks, 8, 9 but this period is about 1 to 2 weeks using a serum or swab analysis. 8, 9 The primary reason for the apparent conflict comes from the fact that the RNA load inferred from RT-PCR does not clarify what fraction of it is culturable or infectious.",

            "text": "Epidemiologically, serial interval is constructed from knowing the days when the symptoms appear in the infectee and the infected. To estimate it, however, one should implicitly know the incubation times (f) of both as well as the infectiousness or the transmissibility of the infection (g) on the day infectee transmits to the infected (Supplementary Figure 1) . Using the data from 181 patients, the incubation time distribution was approximated 12 a Weibull distribution with parameters l=6.258, k=2.453 and other reports 13 agree with this estimate. We thus use the serial interval data from the 1251 individuals, and this incubation estimate to solve the inverse problem of estimating the infectiousness profile, starting from the day an individual is infected (Methods). The criterion used for accepting the estimate was that it maximizes the R 2 between the predicted and the observed serial interval. The best estimate for the serial interval is shown in Figure 1 , and the serial interval that was used for obtaining this prediction was a Weibull distribution with a median of 3.1 days and is shown in Figure  2A . The peak of infectiousness is at 2 days after the infection, and it decreases after it. The effect of the incubation period was averaged over, and the infectiousness profile relative to the day of the onset of the symptoms was obtained ( Figure 2B ). The infectiousness profile shows that a large part of the infectiousness (68.4%) finishes before the onset of the symptoms. The 95% confidence interval on this estimate was obtained using bootstrapping (Methods) as (67.0-69.7%). A sensitivity analysis performed with (l=5.2,k=2.0) and (l=7.0,k=1.5) resulted in consistent estimates for the presymptomatic infections: 65.04% (95% CI: 64.5-65.5%) and 69% (95% CI: 67.8-71.1%) respectively. The average value of the pre-symptomatic infectiousness is much higher than the prediction in the literature 44% (95% CI: 25-69%). 7 The smaller variation is possibly from the larger data set we have used as well as their use of the incubation data from a smaller set of 10 out of the 425 patients studied by Li et al. 1 In order to develop a comprehensive picture of the infectiousness, we compare the profile we estimated to the two clinical laboratory markers: the viral shedding kinetics and culturability. Such relations have been developed earlier for influenza 14 and HIN1. 15,16 Figure  3 shows that the infectiousness profile we estimate in Figure 2B has similar kinetics to the viral shedding kinetics from the nasopharyngeal swab samples. Only the data from the longitudinal studies on individuals was used for this comparison. The chance of obtaining a positive culture decreases with time and its kinetics is also consistent with the viral shedding and infectiousness (Figure 3) . In addition to this kinetics, we also study the correlations between the infectiousness we estimate and the average viral shedding (Figure 4A ) and the chance of obtaining a positive culture ( Figure 4B ) that was calculated by combining data from two different works. 8, 17 Both these correlations are very strong, with correlation coefficients 0.83 and 0.97, respectively and high significance.",

The calculations for infectiousness estimation were repeated as mentioned above with a 10 x 10 grid for scanning over l and k. Using the best estimates for the serial interval in each replicate, the distribution of the infectiousness before symptoms was obtained. This distribution was used to obtain the 95% confidence interval. The infectiousness that was inferred from the serial interval data is shown in two different representations. We assumed that the infectiousness profile starting from the day someone is infected follows a Weibull distribution. Using the quality of the linear regression between the predicted serial interval frequencies and the observed ones from Figure 1 as the optimization criterion, we estimated the parameters to be ls=4.4, k=1.04 over the parameter range.
