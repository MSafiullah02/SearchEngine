Nevertheless, some PPI are so persistent to be considered irreversible (obligatory) for all practical purposes. Other interactions are subject to tight regulation and only occur under characteristic conditions. Depending on their functional role, some protein interactions remain stable for a long time (e.g. between proteins of the cytoskeleton) while others last only fractions of a second (e.g. binding of kinases to their targets). Protein complexes formed by physical binding are not restricted to so called binary interactions which involve exactly two proteins (dimer) but are often found to contain three (trimer), four (tetramer), or more peptide chains. Another distinction can be made based on the number of distinct proteins in a complex: homo-oligomers contain multiple copies of the same protein while hetero-oligomers consist of different protein species.

First, the protein of interest is \"captured\" from a cell lysatee.g. by attaching it to an immobile matrix. This may be done with specific antibodies, affinity tags, epitope tags along with a matching antibody, or by other means. Second, all other proteins in the solution are removed in a washing step in order to purify the captured protein. Under suitable conditions, protein-protein interactions are preserved.

When expressed as separate protein chains, both domains remain fully functional: the BD still binds the DNA but lacks a way of triggering transcription. The AD could trigger transcription but has no means of binding to the DNA. For a two-hybrid test, two proteins X and Y are fused to these domains resulting in two hybrids: X-BD and Y-AD.

Public protein interaction databases that provide interaction data in form of structured, machine-readable datasets organized according to well documented standards have become invaluable resources for bioinformatics, systems biology and researchers in experimental laboratories. The data in these databases generally originate from two major sources: large-scale datasets and manually curated information extracted from the scientific literature. As pointed out above, the latter is considered substantially more reliable and large bodies of manually curated PPI data are often used as the gold standard against which predictions and large-scale experiments are benchmarked. Of course, these reference data are far from complete and strongly biased. Many factors, including experimental bias, preferences of the scientific community, and perceived biomedical relevance influence the chance of an interaction to be studied, discovered and published. In the manual annotation process it is not enough to simply record the interaction as such. Additional information such as the type of experimental evidence, citations of the source, experimental conditions, and more need to be stored in order to convey a faithful picture of the data.

In 2002, the Proteomics Standards Initiative (PSI), a work group of the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO), set out to improve this situation, with contributions from a broad range of academic and commercial organizations, among them BIND, Cellzome, DIP, GlaxoSmithKline, Hybrigenics SA, IntAct, MINT, MIPS, Serono, and the Universities of Bielefeld, Bordeaux, and Cambridge. In a first step, a community standard for the representation of protein-protein interactions was developed, the PSI MI format 1.0 (Hermjakob et al. 2004) .

Q thus takes values between 0 for a set of unconnected nodes and 1 for a fully connected cluster (clique). The statistical significance of Q strongly depends on the size of the graph. It is obvious that random clusters with Q \u00bc 1 involving just three proteins are very likely while large clusters with Q \u00bc 1 or even with values below 0.5 are extremely unlikely. In order to compute the statistical significance of a cluster with n nodes and m connections Spirin and Mirny calculate the expected number of such clusters in a comparable random graph and then estimate the likelihood of having m or more interactions within a given set of n proteins given the number of interactions that each of these proteins has. Significant dense clusters identified by this procedure on a graph of protein interactions were found to correspond to functional modules most of which are involved in transcription regulation, cell-cycle/ cell-fate control, RNA processing, and protein transport. However, not all of them constitute physical protein complexes and, in general, it is not possible to predict whether a given module corresponds to a multiprotein complex or just to a group of functionally coupled proteins involved in the same cellular process.

For this purpose, they define a protein co-evolutionary profile as the vector containing the evolutionary correlations between a given protein tree and all the rest of the protein trees derived from sequences in the same organism. This co-evolutionary profile is a more robust and comparable representation of the evolution of a given protein (it involves hundreds of distances) and can be used to deploy a new level of evolutionary comparison. The authors compare these co-evolutionary profiles by calculating Pearsons correlation coefficient for each pair. In this way, the method detects pairs of proteins for which high evolutionary similarities are supported by their similarities with the rest of proteins of the organism. This approach significantly improves the predictive performance of the tree similaritybased methods so that different degrees of co-evolutionary specificity are obtained according to the number of proteins that might be influencing the co-evolution of the studied pair. This is done by extending the approach of Sato et al. (2006) , that uses partial correlations and a reduced set of proteins for determining specific evolutionary similarities. Juan et al. calculated the partial correlation for each significant evolutionary similarity with respect to the remaining proteins in the organism and defined levels of co-evolutionary specificity according to the number of proteins that are considered to be co-evolving with each studied protein pair. With this strategy, its possible to detect a range of evolutionary parallelisms from the protein pairs (for very specific similarities) up to subsets of proteins (for more relaxed specificities) that are highly evolution dependent. Interestingly, if specificity requirements are relaxed, protein relationships among components of macro-molecular complexes and proteins involved in the same metabolic process can be recovered.

To allow for comparisons, complexes are typically represented by binary interaction networks; however, it is important to realize that there is not a single, clear definition of a \"binary interaction\". For complex pull-down experiments, two different representations have been proposed: the matrix representation, in which each complex is represented by the set of binary interactions corresponding to all pairs of proteins from the complex, and the spoke representation, in which only bait-prey interactions are included (von Mering et al. 2002) . The binary interactions obtained using either of these representations are somewhat artificial as some interacting proteins might in reality never touch each other and others might have too low an affinity to interact except in the context of the entire complex bringing them together.

The first protein consists of two domains, D1 and D2, while the second protein includes the domains D3, D4, D5, and D6. Evolutionary trees for each domain are shown, their similarity serves as an indication of interaction likelihood that is encoded in the interaction matrix strated domain interactions from iPfam and 3did with predictions based on the DPEA algorithm and phylogenetic domain profiling ).

These resources contain iPfam and 3did data and predicted domain interactions taken from several other publications. Predictions are based on several methods for deriving domain interactions from protein interaction data, phylogenetic domain profiling data and domain coevolution.
