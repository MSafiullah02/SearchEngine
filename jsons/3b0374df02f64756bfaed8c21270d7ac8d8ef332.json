Emerging pathogens that cause new diseases (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus [SARS-CoV]), newly recognized microbial agents of known diseases (e.g., human metapneumovirus), and rapidly evolving pathogens (e.g., influenza viruses) all contribute to this seismic shift. A rate-limiting factor in our efforts to keep up with diseases caused by infectious pathogens is the absence of rapid, efficient, and affordable methods for microbial identification. Improving our strategies for diagnosing infectious etiologies will hold the key to our future relationship with infectious agents.",

The article by Renwick et al.

Independently, in publications following that by Lamson et al. [4] , other investigators found similar evidence that associates severe respiratory disease with rhinovirus infection, implicating known serotypes of rhinovirus groups A and B as well as the same, novel viruses found in New York in pediatric lower-respiratory-tract infection [6] or asthma exacerbations [7] . With work now reported by 3 research groups employing different methods, the likely contribution of rhinoviruses to acute respiratory disease cannot be ignored and deserves further study.",

In 1987, the first application of subtractive cloning in microbiology led to the identification of a novel pathogen, Borna disease virus, the prototype of a new family in the order Mononegavirales [8, 9] . Another new strategy-namely, domain-specific differential display PCR-ultimately led to the recognition of West Nile virus as the cause of the outbreak of encephalitis in New York in 1999 [10, 11] . The recent development of pathogen microarrays, combined with a comprehensive panmicrobial sequence database, has added to the repertoire of methods for sensitive and broad differential diagnosis of infectious disease [12, 13] and has facilitated differential diagnosis of filovirus versus malaria in samples obtained during an outbreak of hemorrhagic fever. In early 2007, the same research group [14] pioneered the use of unbiased, high-throughput sequencing to assemble a comprehensive inventory of microflora from honeybee colonies affected by colony-collapse disorder [14] .",

It is no surprise that the list of investigators collaborating on papers from their laboratory often reads like a United Nations of science. Such worldwide capability in global infectiousdisease surveillance is important to local as well as international security.
