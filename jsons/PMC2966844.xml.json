In fact, with current molecular diagnostics, a viral pathogen can be identified in at least 90% of wheezing episodes during the first several years of life.6 All children are infected with respiratory viruses during early life, and up to 50% have a lower respiratory tract illness with wheezing at least once before school age.2 Several environmental factors have been linked to risk of wheezing illnesses during early life. The Tucson Children\u2019s Respiratory Study (TCRS), a prospective unselected birth cohort, identified several risk factors for wheezing during early childhood. Older siblings and daycare, both associated with increased exposure to respiratory viruses, and tobacco smoke exposure were associated with increased risk of early-life wheezing illnesses, whereas breastfeeding was protective.7\n",

A large twin registry in Denmark was used to assess the relationships between severe RSV illness and asthma development.18, 19 The data from this study suggest that severe RSV illnesses and asthma share a common predisposition, and although RSV can lead to short-term recurrent wheeze, it is not causal in long-term asthma development. Similarly, although the TCRS identified RSV wheezing illnesses during the first 3 years of life as an independent risk factor of wheezing at age 6 years, this relationship weakened over time and was no longer significant by age 13 years.3 Thus, early RSV wheeze may lead to a recurrent wheeze phenotype, but it is less commonly associated with lifelong asthma. It would be interesting to determine whether the relationships reported from the Tennessee population-based study between 4 and 5.5 years of age persist over time.",

Nonetheless, a few studies may shed some light on the inflammatory processes that occur in these children. Krawiec and colleagues26 performed bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage on children of median age 15 months with recurrent wheezing and to a group of healthy controls. These studies demonstrated that children with persistent wheezing had increased inflammatory cells and markers of inflammation compared with healthy controls but did not have the characteristic eosinophil predominance seen in older children and adults with asthma. Similarly, Saglani and colleagues27 performed bronchoscopy and biopsy in children of median age 12 months with persistent wheezing and were unable to demonstrate either eosinophilic inflammation or reticular basement membrane (RBM) thickening, both common features of asthma seen in older children and adults. In contrast, in further studies of older children with recurrent wheezing of median age 29 months, they were able to demonstrate the presence of eosinophilic inflammation and RBM thickening when compared with a group of controls. This suggests that inflammatory changes and remodeling typical of asthma develop between 1 and 3 years of age in recurrently wheezing children and highlights the potential importance of environmental exposures, such as virus infections, during this period.",

The authors also found increased VEGF in nasal lavage fluid of volunteers with natural HRV infections. In another epithelial cell model, Zhu and colleagues30 found that HRV infection led to toll-like receptor 3-dependent mucin production and upregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor, a prominent component of epithelial repair. Finally, epithelial cell gene expression studies have identified several potential novel pathways involved in the response to HRV infection. Proud and colleagues31 found that HRV infection led to upregulation of many genes, perhaps most notably in interferon and airway repair and remodeling pathways. Bochkov and colleagues32 similarly demonstrated that HRV infection led to upregulation of a number of genes involved in interferon and airway remodeling pathways. In this study, differences between asthmatics and controls were similar before and during HRV infection. In summary, although data that demonstrates causality of HRV infection in asthma inception are limited, several plausible mechanisms by which recurrent HRV infection could lead to airway damage and remodeling have been identified and are deserving of further study.",

In this study, the decreased interferon-\u03b2 response was associated with delayed apoptosis and increased viral replication, which was overcome with the addition of exogenous interferon-\u03b2. Additionally, lower levels of interferon-\u03b1 (another type I interferon) responses have been demonstrated in the peripheral blood of children40 and adults41 with atopic asthma versus nonatopic controls. Finally, Contoli and colleagues42 found that bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages from atopic asthmatics had impaired interferon-\u03bb (a type III interferon) responses to HRV infection and that these responses correlated with decline of forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration during exacerbations. Although these studies have identified defects in interferon pathways as potential important contributors to early childhood wheezing and asthma, unfortunately, attempts to replicate these findings have not always been successful.

Wheezing illnesses caused by viruses during early life are the most common initial presentation of childhood asthma. Recent evidence suggests that wheezing with HRV is the most robust predictor of subsequent asthma. However, whether HRV is causal in asthma inception is an open question. Plausible mechanisms of causality have been identified but are in need of further study. The most definitive way to prove causality would be to prevent HRV infection and demonstrate reductions in asthma development, but vaccines for HRV have proven elusive, in part due to the nearly 150 existing species of HRV. Studies attempting to identify more virulent or asthmogenic forms of HRV are ongoing and could prove very informative.
