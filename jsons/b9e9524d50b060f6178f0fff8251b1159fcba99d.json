At this time, only two DCTs reported being redeployed, both within a different role in their current trust; 82% felt concerned about potential redeployment. Regarding clinical activities, four DCTs stated they are currently carrying out aerosol generating procedures. The majority have not received any additional training; however, some trusts have instigated this, covering areas such as practical skills and the specific management of COVID-19 patients. One individual noted: 'I am happy to be redeployed if that is where I am needed \u2026 I am worried that if my redeployment comes later on we won't get the training and be stuck in a role where I am out of my competence' .",

Whilst few have been redeployed, the broad consensus is that the DCTs would like more training to feel prepared for a new role and few have received this thus far. Reassuringly, an overwhelming majority feel well-supported within their units. Human factor principles indicate it is important that we look out for each other through training and support to ensure the best teamworking and patient safety. DCTs wish to play a meaningful part in this pandemic, with the aid of appropriate training and practical application of the BAOMS PPE guidance. We hope that there will be continued efforts to clarify the role of DCTs, to maximise the use of their relevant skills and ongoing commitment to the NHS.",
