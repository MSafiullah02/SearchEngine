The concept of a double burden of disease finds its root, implicitly or explicitly, in ideas outlined as far back as 1971 by A.R. Omran. According to this theory, health and disease patterns change over time in societies. Like individuals, societies are thought to have a \u201clife cycle\u201d. In young societies infectious diseases, nutritional deficiencies and maternal, newborn and child\nhealth problems prevail. When societies grow up accidents and violence-related diseases as well as NCDs become more prevalent. In aging societies, finally, NCDs predominate (Omran 1971). The growing burden of NCDs was thought to be a consequence of demographic transition and the double burden of disease was considered a phenomenon of societies in transition which were hit by the emerging epidemic of NCDs, while still struggling with an \u201cunfinished agenda of infectious diseases\u201d (WHO 1999).",

Bygbjerg rightly points to three possible and unintended side effects of this double approach (Bygbjerg 2012):It does not take into account the growing scientific evidence of links between infectious diseases (particularly TB and HIV) and NCDs (particularly diabetes, cancer and chronic obstructive lung diseases) or the importance of improved maternal and child\nhealth in the prevention of NCDs.It creates a competition in resource allocation between the two areas: \u201cAt a time of global financial crises and shrinking health budgets, there is a threat that the battle against common and future health problems, both communicable and non-communicable, may become a fight for funds to control either health problem, rather than a fight against the double burden\nof disease\n.\u201d\nIt blurs the fact that a comprehensive \u201cdouble burden of disease \u201d policy requires integrated control strategies that have to begin in the primary health care sector and need a multidimensional approach.The dual approach in addressing the burden of two disease groups was, however, necessary for political reasons. The HIV/AIDS crisis of the end of the 20th century and the high burden of communicable diseases in low and middle- income countries made it imperative to address the challenge of infectious diseases as a high priority. A delay would not have been understood and could have jeopardized the willingness of low-income countries to cooperate with high- income countries in the area of newly emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, such as SARS , or pandemics of different strains of the influenza virus. It might also have affected their willingness to collaborate with the WHO and its Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network , established in 2000.",

At the same time the leading causes of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)\nin SSA have changed little over the past 20 years. There is, however, evidence for progress made in SSA in the reductions in mortality from malaria, HIV/AIDS, and in maternal conditions.Remarkable declines in health loss from diarrheal diseases, lower respiratory infections , and measles have been achieved. Despite this progress, many of these conditions still top many countries\u2019 health burdens and account for a large portion of childhood death and illness. Malaria and HIV/AIDS continue to drive substantial health loss throughout the region, and do so at rates higher than those two decades earlier; it appears, however, that the total health burdens caused by these diseases peaked between 2000 and 2005 for most countries.While most countries in SSA still face large health burdens due to communicable, neonatal, maternal, and nutritional conditions, many have also experienced an increasing disease burden due to injuries and non-communicable diseases from 1990 to 2010. These dual burdens of communicable and non-communicable diseases are largely found among the lower- and upper-middle-income countries\n, but even low-income countries are now seeing ailments such as stroke among their top 10 drivers of premature death and disability. Road injuries have become an increasingly dominant cause of health loss in the region, with many countries, including Ghana, Kenya, and Nigeria, documenting at least twice the health burden caused by road injuries in 2010 than in 1990.War and conflict affected many countries in SSA in 1990, accounting for a substantial amount of health loss in countries such as Ethiopia and Liberia; by 2010, these causes were no longer primary drivers of premature death and disability.Overall, a number of risk factors, including suboptimal breastfeeding, vitamin deficiencies, childhood underweight, and others associated with under- nutrition, have declined throughout SSA. This has likely contributed to the regional progress in reducing health loss caused by several childhood conditions. However, risk factors associated with growing burdens of chronic diseases, such as high body mass index and physical inactivity, have become important threats to public health in many countries in the region (Fig. 1).\nThe leading 15 risk factors are ranked from top to bottom in order of the number of DALYs they contributed in 2010. Bars going right show the percentage by which risk factors have increased since 1990. Bars going left show the percentage by which risk factors have decreased. Pointed arrows indicate causes that have increased by a greater amount than shown on the x-axis.",

There is, however, a substantial amount of uncertainty because there are few community-based studies that examine the NCDs prevalence, incidence, and risk factors and allow for a projection. Furthermore the prevalence of NCDs and risk factors varies considerably between countries, urban/rural locations, and other sub-populations. The prevalence of stroke ranged from 0.07 to 0.3%, diabetes mellitus from 0 to 16%, hypertension from 6 to 48%, obesity from 0.4 to 43%, and current smoking from 0.4 to 71%. Hypertension prevalence was consistently similar among men and women, whereas women were more frequently obese and men were more frequently current smokers.

Efforts such as the WHO\u2019s NCD \u201cbest buys\u201d (WHO 2011a) represent a good path forward. (2) For most infectious diseases, the time lapse between starting interventions and seeing improvements in mortality and morbidity is low \u2013 months or years; for most chronic diseases, it is high \u2013 years to decades. National leaders will need to define success, progress, and interim milestones in ways that ensure implementation and support through multiple political cycles.

Furthermore, this expansion must be affordable, sustainable, and adaptable for the future. There are many examples of possible solutions to these challenges, many of which are being developed and implemented in SSA, for example:\nPhysical infrastructure: it is far more cost-effective to manage chronic conditions in outpatient and near-home settings than it is to build more acute-care facilities. Mobile technology is making it increasingly feasible and cost-effective for care to be delivered by front-line healthcare workers in the community, and even by patients themselves. The WHO and International Telecommunicatio ns Union (ITU) Health Initiative are bringing together governments and private sector partners to develop, pilot, and scale up successful mobile-based tools and applications for the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases (WHO 2012).\nMedical equipment: the equipment required for the diagnosis and treatment of many chronic conditions\nconditions (e.g., CT scanners, MRI scanners, cardiac pacemakers) has historically been priced beyond what most health systems in sub-Saharan Africa could afford. This situation is changing, both as manufacturers from other countries such as India and China enter the market, and as the main Western manufacturers (e.g., Medtronic, GE, Siemens) recognize the need and opportunity for \u201cfrugal innovation\u201d, expand R&D activities in developing countries, and develop products which are not only considerably cheaper, but also technologically advanced and adapted for use in local settings (Economist 2011).\nMedicines: many chronic conditions\nconditions (and indeed many infectious diseases) can today be managed well with relatively affordable generic medicines. However, in much of Africa, there are still major barriers to access, caused by inefficient supply chains and by complex national regulations that are not yet harmonized with each other. These issues have been recently evaluated and a set of recommendations developed in Galambos and Sturchio (2013).\n",
