On one hand, these therapies are of limited effectiveness and on the other hand, side-effects and systemic toxicity may limit their application, particularly in paediatric, geriatric and compromised patients (Reusser, 1996, Cassady and Whitley, 1997, Bacon et al., 2003, Hayden et al., 1983, Janai et al., 1990, Englund et al., 1990). As a result, there is great interest in developing efficacious antiviral compounds of herbal origin with low toxicity that are well tolerated.",

Innumerable potentially useful medicinal plants and herbs are waiting to be evaluated and exploited for therapeutic applications against genetically and functionally diverse virus families (Jassim and Naji 2003). Several hundred already investigated plant and herb species have potential as novel antiviral agents (Jassim and Naji 2003).

These data could be confirmed by RSV-specific ELISA for the detection of newly synthesised viral proteins with 79.7% reduction for oral drops and 83.8% reduction for dry extract (Fig. 2). The suppressive activity of both Sinupret\u00ae preparations against RSV was concentration dependent. Again, the activity of dry extract was in all dilution steps higher (p\n < 0.001) compared to the activity of oral drops with an EC50 value of 10.4 \u03bcg/ml for dry extract and 20.7 \u03bcg/ml for oral drops (Table 2). The reference substance ribavirin produced approximately 60% reduction of RSV plaques and 57% reduction of virus protein measured by ELISA at a concentration of 6 \u03bcg/ml.",
