As a result of these conferences, guidelines, and recommendations were drafted on how to perform rDNA experiments safely without endangering the laboratory worker, the environment, or society as a whole. Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBCs), soon mandated by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for all entities receiving NIH funding, became a standard at US research institutions as a direct consequence of these recommendations. However, at some institutions, their role has expanded beyond the evaluation of rDNA technology. This chapter will summarize the current challenges that emerging biological agents and emerging technologies present to IBCs in experimental risk assessment and communication, and outline a path forward on how to address them.",

            "text": "In a testament to the foresight of the attendees of the 1975 Asilomar Conference, the text below applies to the challenges of assessing emerging technologies (and agents) almost as well today as it did nearly 40 years ago (emphasis added):This meeting was organized to review scientific progress in research on recombinant DNA molecules and to discuss appropriate ways to deal with the potential biohazards of this work. Impressive scientific achievements have already been made in this field and these techniques have a remarkable potential for furthering our understanding of fundamental biochemical processes in pro- and eukaryotic cells. The use of recombinant DNA methodology promises to revolutionize the practice of molecular biology. While there has as yet been no practical application of the new techniques, there is every reason to believe that they will have significant practical utility in the future.Of particular concern to the participants at the meeting was the issue of whether the pause in certain aspects of research in this area, called for by the Committee on Recombinant DNA Molecules of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A. in the letter published in July, 1974, should end; and, if so, how the scientific work could be undertaken with minimal risks to workers in laboratories, to the public at large and to the animal and plant species sharing our ecosystems.The new techniques, which permit combination of genetic information from very different organisms, place us in an area of biology with many unknowns. Even in the present, more limited conduct of research in this field, the evaluation of potential biohazards has proved to be extremely difficult. It is this ignorance that has compelled us to conclude that it would be wise to exercise considerable caution in performing this research. Nevertheless, the participants at the Conference agreed that most of the work on construction of recombinant DNA molecules should proceed provided that appropriate safeguards, principally biological and physical barriers adequate to contain the newly created organisms, are employed. Moreover, the standards of protection should be greater at the beginning and modified as improvements in the methodology occur and assessments of the risks change. Furthermore, it was agreed that there are certain experiments in which the potential risks are of such a serious nature that they ought not to be done with presently available containment facilities. In the longer term serious problems may arise in the large-scale application of this methodology in industry, medicine and agriculture. But it was also recognized that future research and experience may show that many of the potential biohazards are less serious and/or less probable than we now suspect.(quoted from the Summary Statement of the Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA Molecules [1])\n",

            "text": "At its most basic level, the role of the IBC is to evaluate and ensure the safety of proposed research or scientific activities to both workers and the larger environment where their institutions reside. After the groundwork laid by the pioneers in this field, such risk assessments are sometimes considered routine, and are usually a part of the regulatory and oversight requirements faced by most institutions. However, due to the variable and (occasionally) unpredictable nature of emerging agents and technologies, highly specialized and/or cross-discipline knowledge (e.g., knowledge of niche subspecialties of chemistry, physics, synthetic biology, or even engineering) is sometimes required to adequately evaluate incoming research proposals. Facing proposed research outside their specialized knowledge, IBC members may err on the side of caution, thereby potentially halting or preventing highly promising research. Alternatively, the committee may rely too heavily on the submitter\u2019s judgment of his/her proposal and approve risky activities that should receive a deeper level of scrutiny. In such a case, the temptation to consult ad hoc reviewers will be great and should be encouraged. Such consultation can be an excellent solution to a real or perceived lack of expertise on an emergent technological or biological hazard. Unfortunately, at many institutions (especially smaller or isolated institutions), there is unlikely to be an in-house, objective third party that can effectively evaluate highly specialized research proposals on novel technologies or emerging biological threats. Distinct research groups at the same or different locations that are engaging in research with the same emerging agents or technologies often collaborate or compete, raising questions of objectivity \u2013 even if only in perception. It was noted without irony that the moratorium on rDNA experiments that culminated in the 1975 Asilomar Conference was \u201cvulnerable to portrayal as the fox set to guard the chicken coop\u201d [2].",

Also, while there is no restriction on bringing in expertise from outside the institution, logistics can be problematic. At a minimum, outside reviewers should be aware of their duty to confidentiality (if not required to sign a statement to that effect), should be vetted for conflicts of interest similar to internal reviewers, and be available and committed to the full term of adjudication in case the matter becomes more complex over time. Geographically isolated research institutions may need to sponsor travel, but will likely handle the review process using technological approaches such as secure email or conference calls. While an IBC cannot cede its review process or judgment to the proposal\u2019s authors, it must at the same time be aware of the benefits as well as the potential pitfalls of consulting with external reviewers.",

However, a relevant corollary to the noted effect was that intelligent people often under-rated their abilities in relation to their peers [3]. This lack of confidence in one\u2019s own abilities could lead individual IBC members (or entire committees) to inappropriately cede their judgment(s) to third parties that may be no more capable than the committee members themselves. It must be remembered that science (mostly) progresses slowly, in incremental steps aimed at fulfilling the scientific method; as such, novel topics are generally going to be accessible to a scientifically educated committee member with a willingness to undertake some research and analysis in the performance of due diligence. At the inception of the rDNA Advisory Committees (RACs) and IBCs, members had to acquire a basic understanding of knowledge current researchers now take for granted in assessing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid research proposals. Today, members must be reminded of those approaches when examining complex or novel studies. An example may be a proposal on intercalating drugs that drive RNA viruses to \u201cerror-extinction\u201d by disrupting the quasispecies population beyond its ability to carry genetic informational identity into the next generation [4]. A basic understanding of the nature of genetic identity and the redundant genetic code, coupled with research on the nature of replication fidelity of RNA viruses, will make the concept of disruption of information-carrying capacity accessible to anyone with a strong and relatively current biological educational foundation. Further, an understanding of (or research concerning) the nature of viral genomes and viral replication versus the intracellular sequestration of those activities will allow the committee to assess the risk of the proposed drug to the workers developing it.",

            "text": "Several factors will be relevant to this risk assessment. For instance, whereas a high-molecular-weight drug (actively delivered to the cytoplasm) that binds to RNA will likely bind to all RNA, it will likely be excluded from the nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by normal cellular processes, and will therefore intercalate preferentially into viral mRNAs, rather than cellular mRNAs. Conversely, a small-molecule drug that crosses the cellular membrane passively will likely cross the nuclear/ER membrane as well, and therefore might be considered more hazardous to cellular processes in the absence of other information. While not a guarantee of absolute safety, the process exemplified above is a part of a viable and robust assessment of the risk of a proposed scientific activity, and meets the duty of an IBC in protecting workers and the public.",

The transgenic research community has already faced difficulty in this regard, with examinations of public attitudes about genetically modified organisms (GMOs) finding that \u201c(t)here are only weak correlations between knowledge and attitudes and knowledge and acceptance of GMOs, and a strong correlation between attitudes and acceptance\u201d [5]. Other critical reviews declared that GMOs are \u201cthe new food safety concern which, despite the intense reactions from Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and consumer organizations, have entered our lives with inadequate legislative measures to protect consumers from their consumption\u201d [6]. Efforts to educate the public and reframe discussions away from uncertainty about the unknown to the societal implications of the work, as well as attempting to instill a fundamental understanding of transgenic organisms as the logical extension of rDNA technology, have proven difficult. Polls continue to show a tragic mistrust of the scientific community on this issue. This ongoing conversational confusion has been propagated into the realm of synthetic biology (\u201cThe danger is not just bioterror, but \u2018bioerror\u2019\u201d [7]), \u201cgain-of-function\u201d research on infectious agents (\u201cThe same people continue to make the same arguments, and some scientists \u2018feel like they\u2019re treading water\u2019\u201d [8]), and the use of recombinant proteins as growth or production promoters in food and fiber animals (\u201cCynical activists have unfairly stigmatized a scientifically proven product that has consistently delivered economic and environmental benefits to dairy farmers and consumers\u201d [9]). The IBC can and should play a critical role in communicating the fundamental scientific aspects of such novel work, the risk assessment process, and the essential truth that we, as a society, are safer, more adaptable, and more responsive to natural or man-made threats through increasing our knowledge of the world around us. Simultaneously, it is our thesis that we are made less safe, less adaptable, and less responsive by closing off viable and valuable avenues of research. IBCs have, and should continue to have, the \u201cPower of No\u201d; however, they should use that power only when their decision is based in rational and scientific reasoning absent from partisan or demagogic influence.",

            "text": "When investigators propose to work with novel agents or biotechnologies, authors and reviewers must conduct their discussions openly and pursue direct communication with all stakeholders. Often, such transparency both raises and resolves legitimate concerns. A high standard of communication is necessary, and authors must try to anticipate the needs of reviewers and submit relevant information in a way that allows a scientifically educated reviewer who is not an expert in a specific area to fully assess possible risks of the proposed work. Many laboratory activities are seen as routine, especially by investigators, based on long experience with them or knowledge about their implications to the natural world. However, it must be remembered that these routine activities were once novel technologies that may have created anxiety in reviewers or the public, and might still do so today. For example, in the early days of rDNA manipulations in bacteria, the inclusion of a \u03b2-lactamase-encoding gene in plasmids to achieve ampicillin resistance for selection of transformants was seen as highly controversial [10]. That controversy disappeared once it was highlighted that \u03b2-lactamases are widespread in nature, and that this fact had been known since 1947 [11]. While a \u03b2-lactamase gene could (theoretically) \u201cescape\u201d from a laboratory, it is logical that such a release is in all likelihood inconsequential based on its natural prevalence. The standard for communication of such facts was higher when this technology was novel than it is in current times, when plasmids containing \u03b2-lactamase genes are present in commercially available, unregulated kits.",

For example, using a filamentous virus as a molecular engine to aid in the creation of nanomaterials [12] may put a physicist in the position of submitting to an IBC for the first time in his/her career. In this situation, an IBC can \u2013 and we would argue should \u2013 provide guidance on biological safety to the submitter, such as suggesting alternative organisms consistent with the Asilomar conference findings to limit the risk of rDNA experiments through \u201cthe use of biological barriers [such as] non-transmissible and equally fastidious vectors (plasmids, bacteriophages or other viruses) able to grow only in specified hosts\u201d [1]. Such guidance should be provided to facilitate the review process, but the committee must be open to an ongoing discussion of how and why the author designed the experiments as submitted. For example, expert IBC members might suggest the use of tobacco mosaic virus instead of a virus pathogenic to humans or animals as the molecular scaffolding for nanowire assembly. The researcher may accept this recommendation or respond with biological details of the originally proposed virus that are integral to the hypothesized success of the experiments. However this conversation resolves, in this situation, the IBC\u2019s follow-up role of ensuring that working conditions mitigate risks and meet safety requirements may be more important than the proposal review role.",

When a veterinarian in the western United States hears hoof beats, it is not wise for him/her to search for a zebra. However, that same veterinarian must be aware of the existence of zebras (or adult humans that aren\u2019t healthy, or children, etc.), and be open to the possibility that there may be one in the vicinity. Tragic failures of biosafety have been extensively reported, some due to failures of work practice [14] and some due to unexpected biological interactions [15]. Thus, no work with live pathogenic organisms is (or should be) beyond IBC review. While rare, exposures, infections, and deaths in the setting of laboratory research may be prevented with strict adherence to general biosafety practices along the lines of Standard Precautions in healthcare delivery. Recent biocontainment failures might also have been avoided with adherence to well-established laboratory protocols requiring inactivation of biological agents before transfer [16] or implementing proper inventory/cataloging provisions for pathogen collections [17]. The US government\u2019s response to these biocontainment failures will likely reduce the prospect of any further issues similar to those that occurred, at least in the near future. However, this response does not include a general mandate to anticipate and solve tomorrow\u2019s problems using generally applicable tools and technologies available today [18], [19]. At a minimum, it must be remembered that even research largely considered low-risk (e.g., with exempted organisms such as Escherichia coli K-12 vector systems) must be evaluated for risk by the researcher. Most IBCs will require the researcher to document that review to the IBC, either before work begins, or (more commonly) concurrent with the work through an expedited review process, to ensure that the committee concurs with the researcher\u2019s opinion.

Using some traditional and some modern approaches, PEDV was rapidly discovered to be an alphacoron-avirus, suggesting transmission modes similar to other porcine alphacoronaviruses (e.g. transmissible gastroenteritis virus [TGEV] and its predilection towards spreading via aerosol or contact exposure). However, as of this writing, measures effective against TGEV have proven to be of limited efficacy against PEDV spread [20].",

            "text": "A prime example of the dilemma of IBCs is so-called \u201cgain-of-function\u201d research, i.e. research that aims to genetically modify pathogens with specific biological properties to address pressing scientific issues, such as whether a pathogen could easily mutate into a more aggressive or more transmissible form in nature. Two similar experiments, both successful in making a highly pathogenic avian influenza A (HPAI) H5N1 virus more transmissible in an animal model, led to considerable debate about the danger that such a recombinant virus could escape the laboratory. In the end, the debate resulted in a moratorium on certain experiments with H5N1 until the issue was fully debated and a consensus was achieved. For such a debate to be constructive, it must be held to high standards of rationality and scientific theory, free of demagoguery. A wide variety of expertise is needed, encompassing experience with influenza A viruses, animal models for influenza, and influenza A virus biocontainment elements. The moratorium on certain types of rDNA experiments called for in 1974 [21] limited future work. In an unprecedented recommendation, a 2011 moratorium restricted the publication of the data from existing experiments for 6 months, and was extended to restrict work for approximately a year [22], [23], [24]. The unavailability of the data due to the moratorium on publication of experimental results, despite the fact that the experiments in question had been reviewed and approved by granting agencies, institutional IBCs, and collaborating researchers, led to a significant amount of uncertainty in the influenza research community with regard to which experiments are permitted and/or publishable. More importantly, the absence of publications at the time made it impossible for the larger scientific community to examine the accumulated data and form a rational assessment of the risks proposed by these influenza A virus experiments. After such an examination by expert panels, the (limits of the) mutagenic potential of the influenza A virus [25], the biotechnological controls designed into the recombinant influenza A viruses [24], and the biocontainment level used at the institutions performing the work suggest that the moratorium on both research and publication was more likely driven by the scientific community\u2019s attempts to be responsive to a worried public rather than by substantive concerns among specialists. A similar moratorium was recently instituted based on the emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the net was cast broadly to include MERS-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and HPAI [26].",

Studies from the Kawaoka laboratory showed that predictable changes in the genome of influenza A virus could extend aerosol transmission to a mammalian model of human infection; similar studies from the Fouchier laboratory used known but more unpredictable methods to find that multiple sets of mutations might achieve the same biological result.

Over the course of the next 6 months, continuing deliberations led to the full and complete publication of those manuscripts [23], [24] while continuing a moratorium on similar work for another 6 months. While such work was eventually given permission to restart, it is again now subject to another moratorium, this time in funding. The Gordon conference in 1973 and the Asilomar conference in 1975 openly discussed the emerging technology of recombinant modifications, and brought together accomplished experts to chart a path forward that was scientifically ambitious at the same time that it called for safety and critical review of proposed experiments. The decision to call for a redaction of data on mutations that had been theorized or shown to condition host range in influenza A viruses as far back as 1993 [28], [29] cannot be seen solely as a rational response to the scientific process, or the data it generated. We support the eventual publication of these data, and it is our belief that the ongoing NSABB deliberations concerning the influenza A virus \u201cgain-of-function\u201d experiments serve the public interest and scientific community\u2019s long-term interests. Technical experts from multiple disciplines ultimately made the decision that the data should be published largely unchanged, with recommendations that follow-up research should continue (with a few modifications). Similarly, future experiments and/or technologies should be subjected to rational discourse that both limits the risks of the work through application of technological solutions (e.g. Asilomar\u2019s \u201cbiological and physical barriers\u201d) and facilitates the research in an effort to advance our understanding of the world around us.",

IBCs must fully evaluate the safety implications of emerging agents and technologies to fulfill societal expectations of review that derive directly from the promises of the 1975 Asilomar Conference. However, IBC members must also recognize that we are ultimately safer with increased knowledge and tools for response, and facilitate research and technology development as an active initiative to combat ignorance of the unknown.

In the unlikely event that no background or comparative information exists that can be outlined in a research proposal to the IBC, the IBC can suggest a course of pre-experimental actions based on general biological principles to generate sufficient data for consideration. First and foremost, the early events in the SARS investigations instruct us that education, training, and strict adherence to basic laboratory containment practices are essential in the investigation of novel agents, and could have prevented fatal breaches in standard laboratory practice [47]. The original Asilomar attendees anticipated this need and noted that \u201c(p)articularly important is strict adherence to good microbiological practices which, to a large measure, can limit the escape of organisms from the experimental situation and thereby increase the safety of the operation.

Early characterization experiments should be done at a level of containment that may be in excess of what is used after the risk of the experiments is better known or fully studied. For those novel agents that are recognized due to a human disease outbreak, crucial experiments with live agent that demonstrate susceptibility (or resistance) of the \u201cunknown\u201d agent to possible treatments, cross-reactivity with available vaccines, and/or permissiveness of human cells to infection or biological dysfunction should be performed at a containment level commensurate with the information surrounding the novel agent\u2019s/toxin\u2019s/technology\u2019s discovery/emergence. In a practical sense, novel agents that are recognized due to high virulence, or are closely related to highly virulent viruses, should be initially characterized at higher (e.g. BSL-3 or above) biosafety levels or maximum containment. Those agents that are discovered by research into multifactorial syndromes and/or as adventitious agents not specifically linked to a disease in humans, animals, or plants can be dealt with at a lower containment level depending on an assessment of their risk to laboratory workers and/or the environment. This approach, however, is based on the explicit willingness of an IBC to downgrade the biosafety level at which work is initially performed once sufficient data are available that counter or inform the initial risk assessment. In the past, there have been only a few examples of human pathogens that were initially classified at a high biosafety level and then were downgraded. If downgrading is an unlikely event even in the presence of supporting data, it becomes \u201crisky\u201d for a scientist to (for instance) suggest BSL-4 classification of an \u201cunknown\u201d that causes significant disease in humans, as the low number of BSL-4 facilities greatly limits research and therefore the development of possible countermeasures. The Asilomar attendees knew, and expressly stated, that \u201c(t)he means for assessing and balancing risks with appropriate levels of containment will need to be reexamined from time to time\u201d [1]. Biosafety classification should therefore be re-assessed over time, weighing new or developing information that may condition scientific or public opinion about the pros and cons of the work to laboratorian (and overall public) health.",

Additionally, IBCs are charged with ensuring that the approved work activities are actually performed as stated in the proposal, through a series of follow-up reports, proposal renewals, inspections, and/or \u201cwhistle-blower\u201d-type reporting mechanisms. However, it may occur to readers that an additional expansion of the mandate to consider the likelihood of success of proposed research is logical, especially in today\u2019s limited funding pool. We would like to argue against this expansion for two reasons. First and foremost, research that proceeded from the conception stage to the proposal submission stage has already been, or is currently being, considered for likelihood of success by the funding agency\u2019s subject matter experts. Secondly, novel research should not be stifled by an additional round of review by those that may have less expertise in the specific field being considered. If a scientist has taken the time to submit a protocol for IBC review, it has probably already been funded, unless IBC approval is required before it will be considered for funding. In either case, an IBC should evaluate the researcher\u2019s ability to complete the proposed work safely at their institution only.

In the past, a physician\u2019s order or a researcher\u2019s statement of assurance were most often seen as authoritative and definitive statements to calm the fears of the community. That time has clearly (and thankfully) passed, and anyone who counts solely on the authority (supposedly) conveyed by academic or professional degrees lacks a fundamental understanding of the role and position of science in today\u2019s society. Should IBCs play an active role in facilitating this conversation, both to facilitate research as well as to repair the damage to our larger scientific integrity caused by historical failures? Or, should IBCs act only as resources to skilled public relations professionals, receive training in science communication before engaging in debate, or be discouraged from any form of official (or unofficial?) communications with the public? Finally, how will those internal rules relate to the committee\u2019s duty to be transparent and accessible to the public, codified in Sections IV-B-2-a-(6) and (7) of the NIH Guidelines? Committees are not required to be proactive communicators per se, but the lack of communication presents a hazard to the scientific enterprise that should be decreased or eliminated if at all possible.",

A robust and diverse IBC that makes rational and faithful decisions that serve the interest of the public should not be afraid to discuss (or even defend) those decisions if necessary. Removing the veil of secrecy that many feel surrounds the scientific community can greatly enhance the research enterprise in many tangible and intangible ways. Imagine the embattled neurobiologist and animal researcher. While committed to their work, these researchers may reevaluate their chosen career paths when an animal rights group targets the researcher\u2019s home and/or family [62]. Would the researcher feel more engaged, more effective, and safer if they were viewed differently? A relevant example that presents more broadly applicable health concerns may be the testing of candidate antiviral drugs or vaccines in an outbreak situation (e.g. Ebola virus disease in western Africa, AIDS in southeastern Asia). Are these scientists viewed as people engaged (as respectfully as possible) in troubling but necessary actions in support of public health and a larger, global just and civil society? Can they successfully navigate the moral, ethical, and (perhaps) legal issues inherent in such work? If one believes such work is moral, and perhaps even ethically required, how is that case to be presented?\n",

IBCs must wade into this dynamic activity cautiously and with significant forethought for the benefits and drawbacks. If confronted with a communications issue, IBCs should seek resources in the science of communication just as they would seek external resources for the evaluation of novel technologies or agents.
