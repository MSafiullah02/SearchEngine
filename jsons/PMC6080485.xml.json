Induced blood stage malaria (IBSM) infection was pioneered in the 1990s [1\u20133], and was subsequently refined [4\u20137]. A limiting factor in the IBSM system has been the restricted number of defined P. falciparum strains available. This is in part due to difficulties obtaining suitable material for IBSM studies. Until recently it has been necessary to rely on access to deliberately infected volunteers or malaria-infected travellers returning from overseas. In both cases, ethical approval is required to collect, store and use this material and there are concerns about contaminating infectious agents.",

This allows more flexibility in that new banks can be created as required, and not only when a suitable donor becomes available.

Growth of P. falciparum in the wave bioreactor system is superior to static flask cultures because parasites retain synchrony over at least 3 cycles of invasion. Additionally, the development of multiply infected erythrocytes is reduced; this was shown to be both consistent and reproducible [9, 10]. Disposable plastic bioreactors also allow for careful control and monitoring of the cellular environment, and have been widely used for the culture of plant, animal and microbial cells, and for the production of proteins, antibodies and other biologics conforming to GMP standards [11].",
