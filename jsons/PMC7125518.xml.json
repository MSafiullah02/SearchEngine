Like other picornaviruses such as polioviruses, rhinoviruses (RV), coxsackieviruses, and hepatitis A viruses, a virally encoded chymotrypsin-like protease (3C protease) is required for the proteolytic processing of the large polyproteins translated from the viral RNA genomes and thus essential for viral replication.12, 13 The RV 3C protease was used as a target to develop inhibitor AG7088, aiming to treat the common cold.14, 15, 16 This peptidomimetic inhibitor (see below for structure) contains a lactam ring to mimic Gln at the P1 position, fluoro-phenylalanine at P2, Val at P3 followed by 5-methyl-3-isoxazole, and an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ester at P1\u2032 as a Michael acceptor to form a covalent bond with the active site Cys residue.17, 18 Recent research has shown that AG7088 is effective against EV6 and EV9 with EC50 of 43 and 15 nM, respectively, likely due to the structural similarity of their 3C proteases judging from their sequence homology.19 This provides a starting point for developing potent inhibitors against EV71.\n",

From the computer modeling (Fig. 5\n), we found in order to accommodate the \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ester of 6b (a poor inhibitor) at the S1\u2032 site, its cinnamoyl group is forced away from the S3 site (see the top view in the left panel and side view in the right panel) and could not make proper interaction with the nearby amino acids (e.g., Phe170), leading to significant loss of binding affinity and inhibitory activity.

In contrast to the tripeptide aldehyde inhibitors of RV 3C protease, which contain Gln or unnatural amino acid at P1, Phe at P2, and Cbz-Leu at the P3 position, showing moderate EC50 in the \u03bcM range,26 our inhibitors 10b and 10d with the lactam ring at the P1 position, Phe at P2, cinnamoyl derivatives at P3, and aldehyde at P1\u2032 exhibit great inhibitory activities in enzymatic and anti-viral assays without cytotoxicity. Therefore, P1-lactam group is important and Leu or Val at the P3 position seems not important for the anti-virus activity. However, with only P1-lactam, P2-Phe, and P1\u2032-\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ester, the key features of AG7088, do not guarantee the protease-binding affinity (no enzyme inhibition was found for compound 4 at 20 \u03bcM). Addition of cinnamoyl group at P3 and simultaneous replacement of P1\u2032-\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ester with aldehyde yield potent inhibition as rationalized by the computer modeling. Aldehyde group, which can form reversible covalent bond with the catalytic Cys, is important for inhibition since other compounds with CH2OH or CO2Me at P1\u2032 did not effectively inhibit the 3C protease. Our study provides potent EV71 3C protease inhibitors effective as anti-EV71 agents and facilitates the combinatorial synthesis of derivatives for further improving the inhibitory activity.",
