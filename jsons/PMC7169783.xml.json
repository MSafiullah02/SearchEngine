Within the nucleus, deadenylases trim poly(A) tails for mRNA export and participate in the destruction of non\u2010coding or aberrant transcripts.1 In the cytoplasm, poly(A) tail removal is the first and often the rate\u2010limiting step of general mRNA turnover and is usually required both for subsequent decapping and degradation of the message body2 (Figure 1). Several deadenylase complexes have been identified, including Ccr4\u2010Caf1\u2010Not1, PAN2\u2010PAN3, and PARN.3 While to date no viruses have been shown to directly interfere with specific deadenylases, several examples exist of viral RNAs evading the general deadenylation process.",

Consequently, to avoid degradation, SINV and VEEV RNAs have evolved sequences that can stall deadenylation4 (Figure 2(a)). A combination of conserved sequences in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of the viral genomes act in cis to repress deadenylation in mosquito cell extracts, presumably by mediating interaction with a protective cellular factor.4 A 38\u2010kDa mosquito protein binds both the SINV and the VEEV 3\u2032 UTRs and can be specifically titrated away in the presence of excess viral UTR sequences, leading to decreased viral RNA stability. Interestingly, removal of the 38\u2010kDa protein from SINV RNA leads to increased binding of a 32\u2010kDa mosquito protein. This suggests a mechanism whereby the viral UTRs may be stabilized by displacing a deadenylation\u2010promoting factor via preferential binding to a protective factor. The identity of these two cellular proteins and their conservation across species is currently unknown. However, in the future their characterization will likely provide insight both into how both cellular mRNA deadenylation and viral RNA stabilization are orchestrated.",

PAN contains a 79\u2010nt element (ENE) near its 3\u2032 end that acts post\u2010transcriptionally to stabilize the RNA and promote its nuclear retention.5 The ENE forms a stem\u2010loop structure containing a U\u2010rich loop. This loop makes intramolecular contacts with the PAN poly(A) tail and blocks deadenylation, presumably in part by preventing access of deadenylases to the RNA.6 However, a simple U\u2010rich stretch is not sufficient to recapitulate the effects of PAN\u2010ENE,6 and mutations in the stem region of PAN\u2010ENE can also abolish its function.7 These observations suggest that the entire structure is required for efficient interaction and potentially for the recruitment of additional protective factors. As the function of PAN remains unknown, at present the importance of the PAN\u2010ENE in KSHV infection cannot be assessed. The fact that the decay kinetics of PAN are different from those of cytoplasmic polyadenylated RNAs has led to the speculation that PAN RNA degradation, particularly at the stage of deadenylation, may be carried out by a dedicated nuclear pathway that normally disposes of incorrectly processed RNAs.6 Thus, the study of PAN RNA protection from nuclear degradation may provide information as to how polyadenylation and deadenylation are carried out in the nucleus of mammalian cells and how they contribute to nuclear RNA quality control.",

Like those of all other (+)RNA viruses, the genomes of BMV and HCV are used first as mRNAs for protein production, and subsequently as templates for replication. These two processes are considered mutually exclusive and often require different cis\u2010acting sequences. The genome of BMV consists of three RNA segments that are 5\u2032 capped, but terminate in a 3\u2032 tRNA\u2010like structure rather than a poly(A) tail. Although plants are its natural host, BMV can also replicate in yeast, which has greatly facilitated genetic dissection of host factors involved in its replication cycle. A mutagenesis screen in yeast identified Lsm1p as a host factor required for BMV RNA replication.15 Subsequent studies showed that Lsm1p, together with other components of the Lsm complex, is also required for efficient BMV genomic RNA translation elongation, but not initiation.17 While Lsm\u2010stimulated BMV translation requires multiple regions of the viral RNAs, the effect of Lsm on BMV RNA replication is specifically dependent on 3\u2032 UTR elements.16,17 Thus, partially overlapping signals appear to participate in the seemingly opposing activities of translational enhancement and redirection of RNAs from the translational pool into replication complexes. Notably, Lsm proteins do not regulate the translation of the BMV coat protein from a fourth subgenomic RNA segment, RNA4, which is generated during BMV replication, suggesting that the effects of Lsm proteins on BMV RNA translation and replication are tightly linked.17\n",

However, association with PABP should not result in RNA recruitment to P bodies, as PABP is not a component of P bodies.22 In addition, the mRNAs associated with P bodies are generally believed to be deadenylated.23 Therefore, it is not clear that PABP and Lsm association could substitute for each other in this system.

Their stabilization instead correlates with direct binding of the Lsm1\u20137 complex.25 Poxviruses encode two decapping proteins, D9 and D10, which contribute to the global cellular mRNA turnover that occurs during poxvirus infection. However, D9/D10 can also target viral transcripts and may restrict expression of early viral genes.26, 27, 28 Thus, Lsm proteins may participate in the protection of late viral messages from the viral decapping proteins, although it has yet to be directly proven that this complex protects viral messages during infection or that it blocks D9/D10 decapping activity.25\n",

The best characterized of these pathways is nonsense\u2010mediated decay (NMD), which targets mRNAs harboring a premature stop codon (PTC) (Figure 4). The core NMD effectors are the Upf proteins, which associate with prematurely terminating mRNAs and trigger their rapid destruction. Current models for NMD activation in human cells suggest that Upf1 is recruited to these aberrant mRNAs during the initial round of translation via interactions with the eRF1 and eRF3 translation termination factors, whereupon other effectors of NMD (including Upf2, Upf3, and Smg proteins) join the complex.49 The aberrant mRNA is then cleaved endonucleolytically near the PTC by the NMD factor Smg6, and the message body is degraded by cellular exonucleases50,51 (Figure 4). Two features can mark mRNAs for destruction via the NMD pathway. In human cells, one important feature is the presence of exon\u2013exon junctions downstream of the termination codon, as determined by the retention of exon\u2010junction complexes (EJCs) at these sites. Normally EJCs, which are deposited during splicing, are displaced from the mRNA by translating ribosomes.52, 53, 54 However, NMD can also occur in the absence of splicing, suggesting that downstream EJCs are not always required for activation of NMD.49 Indeed, a second determinant is the length of the 3\u2032 UTR, which is monitored by the proximity of the termination codon to the poly(A) tail. Messages bearing PTCs possess longer 3\u2032 UTRs than their wild\u2010type counterparts and this appears to decrease the efficiency of translation termination and facilitate Upf1 recruitment, even in the absence of downstream EJCs.55, 56, 57\n",

            "text": "NMD represents a potentially formidable obstacle for viruses, many of which encode polycistronic transcripts that would presumably be viewed by the cellular NMD machinery as having aberrantly long 3\u2032 UTRs. Additionally, viruses frequently use alternative splicing to maximize coding potential, possibly creating spliced variants with EJC components remaining downstream of the stop codon used by the 5\u2032 ORF. One way viruses may escape NMD is by tightly regulating their splicing pattern, as is the case with human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV\u20101).58 The sole HIV\u20101 transcript is alternatively spliced to generate more than 30 mRNAs. The genes are always spliced out sequentially in a 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 order, so as to avoid generating transcripts where splicing of 3\u2032 genes leads to deposition of EJCs downstream of the termination codons of the 5\u2032 genes. However, a consequence of this strategy is that the 5\u2032\u2010most genes are generally translated from completely unspliced mRNAs, which have very long UTRs between the stop codon of the first gene and the poly(A) tail. Thus, some viruses specifically avoid NMD by encoding protective elements within their long 3\u2032 UTRs. This is best illustrated by the avian retrovirus Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), which contains a sequence element (RSE) downstream of the Gag gene stop codon that prevents the unspliced mRNA from being targeted for degradation.59 Deletion of this sequence causes a dramatic shortening of the half\u2010life of unspliced RSV mRNA in a translation\u2010 and Upf1\u2010dependent manner, whereas insertion of the RSE protects PTC\u2010containing NMD substrates from degradation. Analyses of the RSE structure using SHAPE chemistry and partial RNase digestion indicate the presence of an AU\u2010rich stretch and stem\u2010loop elements that are conserved amongst 20 different avian retroviruses.60 While the mechanisms by which the RSE blocks NMD remain unknown, an intriguing preliminary observation suggests that it may form an RNA\u2013RNA interaction with a region just upstream of the RSV poly(A) site.60 Given the correlation between the proximity of the stop codon and poly(A) tail for NMD activation, such an interaction could facilitate translation termination by bringing the poly(A) tail closer to the Gag stop codon, thereby decreasing Upf1 recruitment (Figure 4). Alternatively, the RSE may bind proteins that influence the stability of the mRNA.",

Interestingly, PAP\u2010induced turnover of BMV RNA did not occur in yeast defective in the Dom34p endonuclease, a key component of a quality control pathway termed No\u2010go decay (NGD).

Following endonucleolytic cleavage by Dom34p, the resulting RNA fragments are degraded from the 5\u2032 end by the exonuclease Xrn1 and from the 3\u2032 end by the exosome72 (Figure 5).
