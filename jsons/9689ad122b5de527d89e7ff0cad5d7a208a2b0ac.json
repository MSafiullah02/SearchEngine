Antibodies to S. neurona were identified in 10 of 196 (5%) cats in Michigan for which sera were submitted for T. gondii testing. 10 Stanek et al 11 reported that 10% of cats presented to a mobile spay and neuter clinic had circulating antibodies to S. neurona.

The authors are unaware of hepatic injury reported with ponazuril or pyrimethamine. While less likely, direct effects of the Sarcocystis sp. cannot be ruled out. Hepatic sarcocystosis has been reported in the horse 30 and in a dog due to Sarcocystis canis. 18 To the authors' knowledge there is no published data regarding treatment of S. neurona in cats; ponazuril therapy was initiated given its effectiveness against S. neurona in horses (5-10 mg/kg for 28 days) 31 and its use in dogs and cats for the treatment of other protozoal infections. 16, [32] [33] [34] The recommended anticoccidial dose in cats is 7.5-15 mg/kg 16 and doses 4 30 mg/kg and up to 50 mg/kg have been demonstrated to have better efficacy and equal safety margins in a group of research Beagles. 34 Based on these findings, a loading dose of 50 mg/kg was administered for 4 days and the lower dose was administered at discharge. In the absence of structured guidelines, ponazuril treatment was discontinued at the second institution and an accepted T. gondii treatment protocol was administered. 25 Before FDA approval of ponazuril, a similar protocol consisting of the folate inhibitor pyrimethamine, sulfonamides, and supplemental folic acid was used to treat S. neurona in horses. 23 A serum agglutination titer to Sarcocystis sp. of 1:6400 in conjunction with visualization of protozoal merozoites and the presence of clinical signs were strongly suggestive of active infection. However, it should be mentioned that cats experimentally infected with S. neurona developed titers up to 1:62,000 regardless of steroid administration, although they did not develop clinical disease. 35 While the titer was lower in the cat of this case, the difference may reflect exposure to a lower protozoal load than that used in experimental trials. The 32-fold decrease in titer 6 weeks posttreatment supports resolution of active disease.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 380, "end": 382, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 483, "end": 485, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 837, "end": 839, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 879, "end": 881, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1088, "end": 1090, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1169, "end": 1172, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1173, "end": 1177, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1178, "end": 1182, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1183, "end": 1187, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1247, "end": 1249, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1394, "end": 1396, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1694, "end": 1696, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1882, "end": 1884, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2281, "end": 2283, "text": "35", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In summary, this case is noteworthy because it is the first case of Sarcocystis-associated neurologic disease to be diagnosed by visualization of merozoites in the CSF.
