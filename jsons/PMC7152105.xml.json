The pathogenicity is the ability to induce disease, which is characterized by its virulence (infection severity, determined by the germ morbidity and mortality rates) and the level of invasiveness (capacity to invade tissues). No microorganism is completely avirulent. An organism may have a very low level of virulence, but if the host (patient or health care provider) is highly susceptible, infection by the organism may cause disease. The risk of infection increases with the infecting dose (i.e., the number of organisms available to induce disease), the reservoir (i.e., the site where the organisms reside and multiply), and the infection source (i.e., the site from where it is transmitted to a susceptible host either directly or indirectly through an intermediary object). The infection source may be a human (e.g., health care providers, children, visitors, housekeeping personnel) with a symptomatic or an asymptomatic infection during the incubation period. The source may also be temporarily or permanently colonized (the most frequently colonized tissues are the skin and digestive and respiratory tracts).",

The organism may enter the host through the skin, mucous membranes, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, or the bloodstream via intravenous solutions, following laryngoscopy, or from surgical wounds. Organisms may also infect the individual as a result of work accidents with cutting or piercing devices. The development of infection is influenced by the host defense mechanisms that may be classified as either nonspecific or specific:\u2022\nNonspecific defense mechanisms include the skin, mucous membranes, secretions, excretions, enzymes, inflammatory responses, genetic factors, hormonal responses, nutritional status, behavior patterns, and the presence of other diseases.\u2022\nSpecific defense mechanisms or immunity may occur as a result of exposure to an infectious agent (antibody formation) or through placental transfer of antibodies; artificial defense may be acquired through vaccines, toxoids, or exogenously administered immunoglobulins.\n",

            "text": "Droplet contamination is considered a direct transmission of organisms because there is a direct transfer of microorganisms from the colonized or infected person to the host. This generally occurs with particles whose diameters are greater than 5 \u03bcm that are expelled from an individual's mouth or nose, mainly during sneezing, coughing, or talking or during procedures such as suction, laryngoscopy, and bronchoscopy (Fig. 50-2\n). Transmission occurs when the microorganism-containing droplets, expelled or shed by the infected person (source), are propelled a short distance (usually not exceeding 60 cm or about 3 feet through the air) and deposited on the host's conjunctivae or oral or nasal mucous membranes. When a person coughs, the exhaled air may reach a speed of up to 965 km/hr (600 mph).5 However, because the droplets are relatively large they tend to descend quickly and remain suspended in the air for a very brief period, thus obviating the need for special handling procedures for the operating room air. Examples of droplet-borne diseases include influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and others commonly found in droplets from the respiratory tract.",

            "text": "This type of disease transmission involves direct physical contact between two individuals. The physical transfer of microorganisms from an infected or colonized person to a susceptible host may occur from child to health care provider or from health care provider to the child during professional practice (e.g., venous cannulation, laryngoscopy, burn care, suction of secretions). Health care providers working in the operating room may be exposed to skin contamination by body fluids. This is an issue of grave concern because of the potential exposure of health care providers to patients with unrecognized infections, especially hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Hepatitis B is a highly infectious virus that requires a small amount of blood (10\u22127 to 10\u22129 mL) to transmit the disease. The incidence of skin contamination of anesthesiologists and related personnel by blood and saliva is quite high. One study examined 270 anesthetic procedures during 7 consecutive days. The blood of 35 patients (14%) contaminated the skin of 65 anesthesiologists in 46 incidents. Twenty-eight contamination events (61%) occurred during venous cannulation. Five of 65 anesthesiologists who had been contaminated by blood (8%) had cuts in the skin of their hands.7 The importance of this observation is that seroconversion of health care providers has been reported after skin contamination by infected blood from HIV carriers8 and HBV infection after blood splashing into health care workers' eyes.9 Scabies, pediculosis, and herpes simplex are among the diseases most frequently transmitted by direct contact.10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 These studies explain why meticulous hand washing and routine use of barriers such as gloves and eye protection are such an important part of protecting ourselves from such exposures even during routine procedures such as starting an intravenous line or performing laryngoscopy.",

This can occur with the absence of visible blood reflux in the tubing or syringe. Changing a fresh needle to a syringe that will be reused is useless to prevent cross infection, thus emphasizing the importance of not using the same syringe on multiple patients.45\n\u2022\nRefilling both glass and plastic syringes several times has been shown to result in contamination of the contents.45,\n46\n\u2022Some drug formulations, especially propofol, can sustain bacterial growth under certain conditions. Thus, great care should be given to aseptic technique when transferring drugs from the vial to a syringe and not allowing the syringe to remain unused for more than 4 hours.47, 48, 49, 50, 51\n\u2022Needles that had been used for spinal or epidural anesthesia were found to be contaminated with coagulase-negative staphylococci (15.7%), yeasts (1.5%), enterococcus (0.8%), pneumococcus (0.8%), and micrococcus (0.8%), suggesting that despite standard skin preparation and cleansing there is a significant rate of needle contamination.52 It is unclear whether these organisms produce an inoculation that could lead to an infection during neuraxial blockade.\u2022There is a high incidence of skin contamination by blood and saliva of anesthetic personnel that occurs during routine anesthetic practice.7\n\u2022Violations of contemporary guidelines for preventing infections (hand washing, wearing gloves, surgical masks, ocular protection, scrubs, syringe reutilization) by anesthesiologists are frequent. Anesthesia staff are aware of the potentially infectious working environment, but to a great extent (11%-99%) they do not implement protection measures for themselves or their patients.18, 53, 54, 55\n\n",

            "text": "Percutaneous contamination as a result of a cutting or piercing accident is the most effective means to transmit blood-borne pathogens. Evidence suggests that this is the main route of HIV, HBV, and HCV56,\n57 infection, especially if injuries are caused by hollow-bore needles that were used to draw blood or introduce an intravenous line.58,\n59 Over 20 other blood-borne pathogens have been transmitted by this means, including those causing herpes, malaria, and tuberculosis.60 The infectious risk after a percutaneous exposure to blood or body fluids from an HIV-positive person is 0.3%. Among health care providers lacking protective antibodies, the risk of HBV infection after an injury with a cutting or piercing device infected with hepatitis B antigen is approximately 37%; in the case of HCV it is 1.8% (0%-7%). Anesthesia staff lacking HBV protective antibodies are at high risk for acquiring the disease.61,\n62 These infection rates underscore the need for the use of \u201csafe\u201d needles and the need to advocate the use of \u201cneedleless\u201d systems even though they are significantly more expensive. This also emphasizes the need for meticulous handling and disposal of needles and other sharp instruments as well as the use of special \u201csharps boxes\u201d designed to minimize accidental needlesticks (e.g. \u201cmail box\u201d type boxes that do not allow the hand to enter the disposal area).63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated that in the United States there are approximately 385,000 cutting and piercing accidents annually among health care providers in hospitals; 25% of these occur in the operating room.60 However, the actual prevalence is believed to be much greater because many of these events are unreported. The distribution of these accidents among anesthesiologists is shown in Figure 50-3A\n; the distribution of the elements most frequently associated with cutting and piercing injuries in health care providers is shown in Figure 50-3B. Should such an accident occur (needle puncture, exposure to nonintact skin, mucous membrane exposure) there are now specific recommendations regarding immediate assessment of risk, assessment of the exposure source (chart review, inform the patient that an accident has occurred and ask permission to determine HBV, HCV, and HIV serologic tests) and initiation of appropriate treatment of the health care worker. It is advised to obtain as much information regarding the patient as possible if the patient is known, to obtain a sample of blood from the patient for determination of potential carrier state (Table 50-4\n), and to report to the health service for immediate institution of prophylaxis and follow-up (Table 50-5\n), especially for HIV exposure (Tables 50-6\nand 50-7\n).",

One positive example of such education is that anesthesiologists who have read the CDC's Universal Precaution Guidelines for the Prevention of Occupational Transmission of HIV and HBV develop better hygienic practices.55\n\u2022Provide health care workers with hepatitis B vaccine and document that an appropriate immunologic response was achieved. Provide hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) for those exposed who do not have established immunity.4\n\u2022Provide a health care service for employees for counseling and post-exposure prophylaxis should an exposure to HIV occur.80\n\u2022Provide regular surveillance of health care workers to determine established immunity to infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox. Lack of immunity may require immunization; several studies have demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of immunization (for prevention of disease) versus the cost of replacement of health care workers who have become infected.57, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86\n\n",

Table 50-8\nshows the 2003 HICPAC's (Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee) and CDC's general recommendations for ventilation system specifications for the operating room.87 Children with tuberculosis require special consideration because of the high risk of occupational transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis,88,\n89 especially after the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis (MDR-TB) (Table 50-9\n). An easy preventive measure is to screen all children before coming to the operating room to determine recent exposure to infectious disease such as measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox because these diseases can pose a significant risk to health care providers and to patients, especially immunocompromised patients.57,\n82 Another potential source for air-borne spread of pathogens is through the anesthesia circuit that may be reduced by the use of filters within the circuit. However, at present there are no regulatory requirements to use such devices and performance characteristics vary widely.19,\n20,\n90,\n91\n",

Unfortunately, the scientific basis for hand washing was not established until the introduction of the germ theory of disease by Louis Pasteur100 and the discovery of the microorganism that caused anthrax (Bacillus anthracis) by Robert Koch101 in the late 19th century. More than one and a half centuries later, and with strong evidence that health care providers are one of the most frequent sources of infection transmission among patients,102 health care providers' compliance with hand hygiene protocols in the hospital environment is generally small (5%-48%) and difficult to change,103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109 especially in intensive care areas, operating rooms, and postanesthesia care units. The risk of pathogen transmission through the hands is proportional to the power of the number of times a child is touched.110\nTable 50-10\npresents a summary of the indications for hand washing and antisepsis.",

Surgical procedures that involve contamination from the bowel require antibiotic treatment against gram-negative and anaerobic pathogens. For these procedures, cefoxitin, cefotetan, or a second-generation cephalosporin is appropriate.122 The selection of antibiotics requires consideration of resistance patterns as determined by local microbiology or health center infectious disease departments. The newer-generation broad-spectrum antibiotics should not be used for routine antibiotic prophylaxis but should be reserved for the treatment of resistant organisms. Moreover, the dose of antibiotic selected should be based on the child's weight or body mass index; administration should be repeated intraoperatively if surgery exceeds more than two half-lives after the first antibiotic administration (see Table 50-11), if the duration of surgery exceeds 4 to 8 hours, if blood loss is extreme, or if the drug has a particularly short half-life (e.g., penicillin or cefoxitin) to ensure appropriate tissue concentrations of antibiotic until wound closure.123\n",

With a brief time interval between establishing intravenous access and skin incision, it is important to administer the antibiotics as soon as possible after intravenous access is established. If vancomycin must be used for prophylaxis, it should be infused slowly over 60 minutes (to minimize the risk of severe hypotension) beginning within 2 hours of skin incision. If a tourniquet is required, the full antibiotic dose should be administered before the tourniquet is pressurized.126 Postsurgical prophylactic antibiotics are not necessary for most procedures and should generally be stopped within 24 hours after the surgical procedure.126\n",

The use of antibiotic prophylaxis for postoperative infections is well established for clean-contaminated procedures. Within the clean category, prophylaxis has been traditionally reserved for surgical procedures involving a foreign body implantation or for any surgical procedure where a surgical site infection would be catastrophic (e.g., cardiac surgery or neurosurgical procedures). However, there is evidence to demonstrate that postoperative infections resulting from procedures not involving prosthetic elements are underreported; estimates show that over 50% of all complications occur after the patient is discharged from hospital and are unrecognized by the surgical team. Therefore, antibiotic prophylaxis is also recommended for certain procedures such as herniorrhaphy.131,\n132 The direct and indirect costs of these complications will not affect the hospital budget; however, they represent a high cost for the community at large. In the case of contaminated or dirty procedures, bacterial contamination or infection is established before the procedure begins. Accordingly, the perioperative administration of antibiotics is a therapeutic, not a prophylactic, measure.
