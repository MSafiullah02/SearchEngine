Although the coronavirus, implicated in SARS, may have directly caused the aforementioned; glucocorticoids can cause lymphopenia by causing the migration of lymphocytes from the peripheral circulation [3, 4, 5], and neutrophilia [3, 6] by inhibiting apoptosis [6]. Moreover, glucocorticoids are used in lymphoproliferative diseases as cytolethal agents [7]. Glucocorticoids were used in treating SARS patients, and thus lymphopenia and neutrophilia may have been drug induced. In one study [2], the prevalence of lymphopenia was 54% at admission, but only 40% of the patients were treated with steroids for the first 48 h. Therefore not all of the lymphopenia (and neutrophilia) can be ascribed to exogenous steroids.",

We therefore questioned whether lymphopenia in SARS is reflecting the integrity of the hypothalamic\u2010pituitary\u2010adrenal (HPA) axis, and that patients without lymphopenia are perhaps adrenal insufficient [9]. In this retrospective study, we have examined the relationship between serum cortisol and white blood corpuscles (WBC) in a cohort of SARS patients with or without lymphopenia and neutrophilia.",

This included fever with body temperature of 38 \u00b0C or higher, cough or shortness of breath, new pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph, and either an exposure to a confirmed SARS\u2019 patient or a lack of response to empirical antimicrobial therapy for typical and atypical pneumonia including beta\u2010lactams, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, or tetracyclines. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome was subsequently confirmed in all patients by seropositivity and/or positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain test for SARS\u2010associated coronavirus. Serum specimens from 57 patients, all collected in the morning and before the commencement of therapy, were assayed for cortisol by the electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics Corporation, IN). The intra\u2010 and interassay coefficients of variation were 2\u00b70 and 3\u00b70%, respectively. In two patients cortisol exceeded 7220 nmol L\u22121 (peak stress response [8]) and were eliminated before statistical analyses. An aliquot of blood specimen was used for WBC measurements. T lymphocytes (CD3+), B lymphocytes (CD19+), helper T lymphocytes (CD3+CD4+), suppressor T lymphocytes (CD3+CD8+), and natural killer lymphocytes (CD3\u2212CD16+ and/or CD56+) in whole blood were measured by MutliTEST\u2122 IMK Kit along with TruCOUNT Tubes (Becton Dickinson, San Diego, CA) using a 4\u2010colour FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). The method had 10% imprecision. Lymphopenia was defined as lymphocyte count < 19%[normal range (NR) 19\u201347%] and neutrophilia as neutrophil count > 73% (NR 41\u201373%) of the total WBC. The frequencies of lymphopenia or neutrophilia relative to cortisol deficient (< 414 nmol L\u22121[10]) or replete state were tested by 2 \u00d7 2 \u03c72 test. All data were analyzed using the Statistica software (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK).",

With lymphocyte subsets, cortisol correlated negatively with suppressor CD8+ cells, B lymphocytes and helper CD4+ cells (all correlations were significant with P < 0\u00b705, see Table 1). In 54 out of 59 patients lymphopenia concurred with neutrophilia, but lymphocytes were not inversely correlated with neutrophils. Cortisol was significantly higher in the lymphopenic compared with nonlymphopenic patients (P < 0\u00b7005; Mann\u2013Whitney U\u2010test) and the neutrophilic compared with non\u2010neutrophilic patients (P < 0\u00b70001; Mann\u2013Whitney U\u2010test) (Figure 1).

A critical illness such as SARS should cause secretion of 225\u2013440 mg day\u22121 of cortisol with a blood concentration of 883\u20137220 nmol L\u22121[8]. The patients exhibiting lymphopenia and neutrophilia had cortisol in this range, which may explain their WBC status. O\u2019Donnell et al. suggested that apoptosis may explain lymphopenia in SARS [11], based on their findings of lymphopenia and neutrophilia in children with severe respiratory syncytial virus disease. It is difficult to explain why viral infection causes apoptosis in lymphocytes, but not in neutrophils. As stated earlier, cortisol action can explain both lymphopenia and neutrophilia.",

It is difficult to say if the patients with lymphopenia and neutrophilia fared any better than those without and vice versa, but it is noteworthy that patients admitted to Intensive Care Units or who eventually died had a significantly higher neutrophil count [1].
