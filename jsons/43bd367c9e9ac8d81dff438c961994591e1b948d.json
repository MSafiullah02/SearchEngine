This is mostly due to a paucity of information on the health consequence of minimal-to-moderate immunosuppression, as might be expected to occur from inadvertent exposure to immunotoxic agents in humans. It is important that a scientifically sound framework be established that allows for the accurate quantitative interpretation of such data for use in the risk assessment process. In immunotoxicology, this may require, for example, development of a model to equate moderate changes in leukocyte counts, CD4 cell numbers, and/or immunoglobulin levels, tests which can be readily performed in human populations, to potential changes in the incidence or severity of infectious diseases, as well as establishing the social and economic impact of the incidence change. Although experimental animal models usually provide an opportunity to establish more reliable exposure estimates and conduct more informative immune tests than those that can be conducted in humans, extrapolating these findings across species is always of concern.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "The development of a framework to perform such extrapolations is currently being addressed by the authors' workgroup. As an integral process to this undertaking, a review of studies that address the qualitative and quantitative relationships between immune parameters and disease is contained herein. Initially, the most likely clinical consequences that may occur as a result of chronic mild-to-moderate immunosuppression are described, as well as nonimmune factors that may modify these disease outcomes. Clinical and experimental animal studies that have examined immunosuppression disease relationships are reviewed and quantitative relationships, when available, are delineated to help address gaps in human health risk assessment. To address the potential social and economic consequences that could result from immunotoxicity, a brief description of the general impact of infectious disease is provided on these parameters. The most comprehensive data bases that address immunodeficiency disease relationships, specifically primary (genetic) immunodeficiency and AIDS, are not discussed, as these represent extreme examples of immunosuppression and neither the specific clinical diseases that result nor the eventual outcomes have much in common to that which occurs in individuals with chronic mild-to-moderate immunosuppression.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Before continuing, it is useful to provide clarification of certain terminology. Immunosuppression, immunodeficiency, and immunocompromised are nonquantitative terms that reflect a reduced capacity of the immune system to respond to antigens, and the terms are often used interchangeably in immunotoxicology. For the purpose of risk assessment, immunosuppression can be defined as a loss in the ability of the immune system to respond to a challenge from a level considered normal, regardless of whether clinical disease ensues. Immunodeficiency often represents an alteration in the immune system that can potentially lead to clinical disease, whether primary (i.e., genetic etiology) or secondary (epigenetic) in nature. The term, immunocompromised, like immunosuppression, indicates a deficient immune response, independent of whether or not it is maladaptive. Immunotoxicity encompasses each of these terms, but it specifies that the effect on the immune system originates from xenobiotic exposure.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "TERMINOLOGY"}, {"text": "As immunotoxicology testing is increasingly included in toxicological evaluations (House, 2003) , there is added impetus to better associate detected changes with these tests to potential clinical outcomes. Although infectious disease is the most obvious, the consequences of maladaptive immunity can affect the etiology, progression, and/or severity of a much broader range of disorders, including certain cancers and autoimmune disease. Establishing the quantitative relationship between altered immune responses and frequency or severity of disease in human populations is challenging, as many factors may contribute (Morris and Potter, 1997) . This is summarized schematically in Figure 18 .1.1, where the appearance, progression, and outcome of infectious disease is viewed as an interrelationship between the virulence of the organism, infectious dose (number of organisms required to produce illness), integrity of the host's anatomical and functional barriers, and overall immunocompetence of the individual. The latter is affected by genetics as well as age, gender, use of certain medications, drug/alcohol use, smoking history, stress, and nutritional status. These factors probably account for most of the variability reported in mean immune values, which can exceed two standard deviations. Another challenge when establishing quantitative associations between immune function and disease is to account for the functional overlap (i.e., redundancy) that exists between the various immune responses and disease. As multiple effector mechanisms are evoked in response to a disease, redundancy is often misinterpreted as reserve; however, as with other organ-systems, such as the liver or central nervous system, the existence of an immune reserve in the general population, where disease can occur in uncompromised individuals, is unlikely. In contrast, immune redundancy, as discussed by Halloran (1996) , is scientifically supported and can be empirically examined. The effect of redundancy on the interpretation of immunotoxicology studies was recently addressed by Keil et al. (2001) using factor analysis and multiple/logistic regression to quantitatively evaluate the contributions of different immune system parameters in host resistance.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 82, "end": 95, "text": "(House, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 620, "end": 645, "text": "(Morris and Potter, 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 1900, "end": 1915, "text": "Halloran (1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2080, "end": 2098, "text": "Keil et al.

The particular microorganism responsible for an infection may assist in identifying the qualitative and quantitative nature of the immunodeficiency. For example, extracellular pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza, multiply only outside phagocytic cells and, thus, produce disease only when they can resist phagocytosis. Facultative intracellular pathogens, (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis), are generally phagocytized but resist intracellular killing. Thus, infections with extracellular or facultative intracellular organisms are more frequent in individuals with impaired phagocytic mechanisms, (e.g., neutropenia), or when humoral immune deficiencies are present.

Common pathogens occur in the general population at frequencies associated with their infectious nature (e.g., virulence, ease of transmission), as represented by viruses that cause influenza infection and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The respiratory system is the most vulnerable target for common pathogens, as it is directly exposed to the external environment and has a large surface area: four times the combined total surface area of the gastrointestinal tract and skin (Gardner, 2001) . Upper-respiratory infections occur in all age groups but produce the most severe effects in the very young and very old due to their lesser immunocompetency. Although influenza is responsible for more morbidity and mortality than any other infectious agent in recorded history (Patriarca, 1994) , the low individual rates of infections in the general population (only one or two episodes in an individual per year), combined with underreporting, make it difficult to detect changes in infection rates in most epidemiological studies.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 621, "end": 636, "text": "(Gardner, 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 916, "end": 933, "text": "(Patriarca, 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Infectious Diseases"}, {"text": "While infections with common pathogens occur routinely in the healthy population, opportunistic infections are typically seen in individuals with severe immunosuppression, such as AIDS patients.

In the case of members of the herpes virus family, including cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the virus remains in the tissue in a latent form following primary infection for the duration of the host's life. In healthy individuals, the immune system maintains viral latency, with cellular immunity playing a major role. When the cellular immune response is compromised, viral replication can ensue and potentially cause severe complications or death. Preceding viral activation, a vigorous immune response to viral-specific antigens occurs in response to replication.

In contrast to cancers of internal organs, in particular those in the lung and liver, which are often induced by chemical carcinogens, virus-induced cancers are more immunogenic and, thus, more likely influenced by immunological factors. Suppression of cellmediated immunity has been associated with higher incidences of skin cancers, leukemias, and lymphoproliferative disorders in transplant patients, whereas Kaposi's sarcoma and EBV-associated B cell lymphomas are associated with severe immunosuppression as seen in patients with AIDS. Natural killer (NK) cells are more likely to play a role in resisting the progression and metastatic spread of tumors once they develop, rather than preventing initiation (Herberman, 2001) . Unexpectedly, studies of individuals with NK cell deficiency states, most of which are associated with single gene mutations, have helped identify a role for NK cells in defense against human infectious disease.

There are also disadvantages, as ethical considerations provide little opportunity for exposure with toxic chemicals. Furthermore, studies with extensive biological monitoring and functional immune tests can be expensive, and exposures as well as outcomes of interest may be difficult to study in the available time frame as study participants are not typically available for longterm exposures or extended follow-up. For the purpose of obtaining data for immunotoxicological risk assessment, clinical studies are particularly useful as they can provide data on the frequency of infections or the level of immune response to vaccines.

In addition to high costs, observational studies are challenging for many reasons, including potential confounding by host (age, gender, and lifestyle) and environmental (frequency of exposure to chemicals and infectious agents) factors. A secondary measure of control in observational studies is through the use of multivariable analysis techniques (e.g., regression modeling), providing there is sufficient sample size and information on potential confounders.

Although in some instances body burdens of chemicals have been determined, drawing broadly applicable conclusions from some of these studies is difficult. This is because subjects may have been exposed to chemicals other than those specifically addressed by the study, and characterization of chemical exposure may rely on subject recall or rough estimates of the duration and intensity of exposure. Furthermore, in contrast to experimental animals, functional assessment is considerably more difficult in humans as it requires antigen challenge, which involves some risk to the individual. When such studies have been undertaken, subjects have been provided commercial vaccines, such as hepatitis antigen (Weisglas-Kuperus et al., 2000; van Loveren et al., 2001; Yucesoy et al., 2001; Sleijffers et al., 2003) .

In most epidemiological studies, testing in humans has been limited to blood collection where peripheral cell counts and differentials, immunoglobulin levels, or immunophenotyping are performed.

In a study of Inuit infants in Arctic Quebec, Canada (Dewailly et al., 2000) , the relative risk of recurrent episodes (at least three per year) of otitis media was higher in breast-fed infants in the second and third highest percentile of organochlorines exposure, compared to the lowest.

In this sample, the body burden of PCBs at age 42 months was associated with higher prevalence of recurrent otitis media and chicken pox. PCB body burden was not associated with differences in lymphocyte markers outside the normal range for age-matched children, although levels in breast milk and cord blood were positively correlated with lymphocyte counts and various T-cell subsets.

Although some studies have described associations between pesticide exposure, altered immune function, and increased rates of infection, sample sizes were generally small and, in some cases, patients were self-selected based on symptoms rather than exposure. Furthermore, the frequency of infections was typically estimated by recall over several years and immune function data were scarce. Not all studies suffer from these shortcomings. For example, a relatively large (n = 1600) and well-defined population living in and around Aberdeen, North Carolina, near a pesticide dump site (a priority Superfund site containing organochlorine pesticides, volatile organic compounds, and metals), was evaluated for immune function and frequency of viral infections. Compared to a neighboring community, residents of Aberdeen, ages 18 to 40, were found to have higher incidence of herpes zoster (reactivated herpes infection causing shingles), but no difference in the frequency of other infectious diseases (Arndt et al., 1999) . In a substudy of 302 individuals, those living in Aberdeen had significantly higher age-adjusted levels of plasma DDE than those living in neighboring communities. Furthermore, higher levels of plasma DDE were related to lower lymphocyte responses to mitogens but higher absolute lymphocyte counts and IgA levels (Vine et al., 2001) . In a separate analysis, residents living nearer to the pesticide dump site had both a lower lymphocyte response to mitogen stimulation and a greater likelihood of having a lower percentage of CD16 + (NK) cells, (<8%, the lower limit of the normal reference range; Vine et al., 2000) . The association seen with reactivated herpes infection is plausible in light of these changes, given that NK cells play an important role in the generation of cytotoxic Tcells required to help control viral infections. These studies illustrate several challenges in demonstrating the effects of chemical exposures in a population-based setting. Although an infectious outcome (zoster) was associated with residential history of chemical exposure in Aberdeen, suggesting immunosuppression related to proximity to the dump sites, the more extensive and expensive immune markers and serum indicators of exposure were only examined in a small subset of the original sample.

While immunosuppressive therapies have greatly improved over the past 40 years, transplant patients are still predisposed to high rates of malignancies and infections. Infection rates range between 65% and 70% during the first 6 months post-transplantation, with CMV representing 18% to 67% of the reported infections (Sia and Paya, 1998) . With the advent of long-term monitoring, an increased incidence in cancer has also been noted in this population. For example, the risk of developing skin tumors following renal transplantation is 10% after 10 years and 40% after 20 years, while the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma is 250-fold higher and for basal cell carcinoma 10-fold higher than the general population (Hartevelt et al., 1990) . The initial immunosuppressive therapy for renal transplant consists generally of a combination cyclosporin (CsA), azathioprine, and steroid cocktail. Therapies are subsequently reduced, but adjusted based upon the time following transplant, evidence of acute rejection, evidence of toxicity (usually serum creatinine levels), and white blood cell count, the latter of which is maintained above 4000 cells/mm 3 . Jamil et al. (1999) , examining 478 renal transplant patients, showed that the risk of lymphomas and infections during the first 6 months post-transplantation increased proportionally with the level of immunosuppressive therapy ranging from 1.5-to 3-fold. Urinary tract infections, which are associated with the transplant, were the most common type of infection in all groups, while severe bacterial infections (pneumonia and septicemia) and systemic/invasive fungal infections were almost exclusively associated with those on the most intensive immunosuppressive therapy. A high incidence of CMV antibodies occurred in all three groups with 9%, 29%, and 53% seroconverting, based upon the level of immunosuppressive therapy. In contrast to infectious diseases, there were fewer cases of squamous and basal cell carcinomas in the most aggressively treated group compared to the other groups, probably due to the anti-proliferative effects of some of the therapeutics. Wieneke et al.

Neonates are particularly susceptible to infectious agents that require adult-like production of antibodies and complement to mediate phagocytosis and bacteria killing.

Bacteria that are commonly associated with neonatal sepsis and infections, such as gram negative E. coli, are initially controlled by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), the first cells to arrive at sites of infection or tissue damage. PMNs in the newborn are not only produced at a lower rate than in adults (Wilson, 1986) , but those produced have approximately half of the lysozyme and lactoferrin levels of adult cells (Ambruso et al., 1984) and only 30% of the adult content Immunotoxicology 18.1.9 of bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein that are important in destroying microorganisms (Levy et al., 1999) .

This form of passive protection wanes as the maternal antibody is catabolized, and by 1 to 3 months of age, infants have only 30% of adult Ig levels (Stiehm and Fudenberg, 1966) .

Phenotypic analyses of cord, neonatal, and adult peripheral blood has also shown differences in T cell subpopulations (Table  18. 1.1), as well as differences in the balance of Th1 and Th2 cytokine production. At birth, the response is skewed in favor of Th2 cell responses (Upham et al., 2002) , presumably decreasing the efficiency of host-protective responses, particularly to intracellular bacteria, while increasing the risk of developing allergic asthma. Similar age-related defects in immune function may also be a predisposing factor in repeated inner ear infections in young children.

In adults over 75 years of age, pneumonia and influenza together are the fourth leading cause of death (Yoshikawa, 1983) . Although immunization is effective on a population basis, the CDC estimates that 90% of the excess deaths each year from influenza occur in individuals over 65 years old, due in part to poor vaccination responses (Fukuda et al., 1999) . While the neonatal immune system is characterized by immature cells, the immune system in the elderly is characterized by normal numbers of mature cells but a decline in their ability to respond to imunogen (Shou et al., 1976; Wayne et al., 1990) . Increased rates and severity of infection that occur in the elderly is the product of these effects as well as other physiological changes associated with the aging process. Physical effects include inefficient bladder function, decreased clearance of lung secretions, and reduced gastric acidity (Gavazzi and Krause, 2002) , culminating in reduced barrier or clearance functions that normally reduce bacterial load in these organs. Various degrees of malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies are also more common in the elderly and can contribute to decreased resistance (Lesourd, 1997) . Although the relative distribution of immune cells does not change dramatically in the elderly, changes in the relative abundance of certain cell subpopulations do occur. Loss of na\u00efve cells, which is secondary to thymic involution, appears in the third decade of life. Na\u00efve T cells predominate in the circulation of young adults, while the relative distribution in the elderly shifts towards an increased proportion of memory cells. For example, Lesourd (1999) reported a 55% decrease in CD45RA + T cell counts and a 43% increase in CD45RO + cells in a population with an average age of 78 years, compared to 30 year olds (Table 18 .1.2). Despite increased populations of specifically educated memory cells, many of these cells respond poorly, presum-ably because they have reached their replicative limit (Effros and Pawelec, 1997) . Patterns of cytokine production also change with aging. Although contradictory results have been obtained in human studies, Cakman et al. (1996) reported that IFN-\u03b3 production is reduced by 70% while IL-4 production is increased by 4fold in the elderly compared to 20 to 35 year olds. This may in part explain reduced cellmediated resistance to influenza infection in the elderly. Although the total numbers of circulating B cells do not change with age, B cell responses are also compromised in the elderly (Weksler, 2000) . Immunization with diphtheria toxin in younger subjects produces higher antibody titers that persist longer than titers in older subjects. When evaluated at the single cell level, plasma cells in younger subjects are more plentiful and produce more antibody, on a per cell basis, than those from the elderly (Burns et al., 1993) . In addition to functional changes in cellular and humoral immunity, innate immunity is suppressed in the elderly, including PMN function, which results from reduced superoxide production and shorter half-lives (Lord et al., 2001) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 182, "end": 207, "text": "(Burns and Goodwin, 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 397, "end": 414, "text": "(Yoshikawa, 1983)", "ref_id": "BIBREF111"}, {"start": 630, "end": 651, "text": "(Fukuda et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 861, "end": 880, "text": "(Shou et al., 1976;", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 881, "end": 900, "text": "Wayne et al., 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 1200, "end": 1226, "text": "(Gavazzi and Krause, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1478, "end": 1493, "text": "(Lesourd, 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1944, "end": 1958, "text": "Lesourd (1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 2304, "end": 2330, "text": "(Effros and Pawelec, 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2471, "end": 2477, "text": "(1996)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2841, "end": 2856, "text": "(Weksler, 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 3166, "end": 3186, "text": "(Burns et al., 1993)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3399, "end": 3418, "text": "(Lord et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2120, "end": 2129, "text": "(Table 18", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "The Elderly"}, {"text": "As it is relatively difficult to determine the contribution of chronic low-level immunosuppression or the cumulative effects Immunotoxicology 18.1.11 Selgrade et al.

As the endpoints in these tests have evolved from relatively nonspecific (e.g., animal morbidity and mortality) to continuous measures, such as tumor numbers, viral titers, or bacterial cell counts, the sensitivity of these models has increased, although they are still limited by the number of animals that can be realistically devoted to any laboratory study and interanimal variability.

A study by Wilson et al. (2001) was specifically designed to determine the magnitude of NK cell suppression that would translate into altered resistance in three disease models. The studies were conducted by NK cell depletion with an antibody to the cell surface molecule, Asialo GM1, using a treatment regimen that did not alter other standard immune function tests used in the assessment of immunotoxicity in rodents. These authors demonstrated that at low levels of tumor challenge, an approximate reduction of 50% or more in NK cell activity, now thought to be involved primarily in metastatic processes, was required before significant effects on resistance to NK-sensitive tumors could be observed. These studies also demonstrated that the level of suppression needed to alter host resistance was related to the challenge level of the tumor.

Using the prototypical immunosuppressive agent dexamethasone, these authors demonstrated that contrary to what would be expected based on the compound's suppressive effects on cytokine production, T cell function, and NK cell activity, relatively high levels of dexamethasone were needed to decrease resistance to Listeria monocytogenes. At doses that suppressed many immune parameters, an increase in neutrophil numbers, and nitrite production by peritoneal macrophages was observed. It was suggested that at lower doses of dexamethasone, the significant increase in the concentration of neutrophils in the blood, in conjunction with increased production of nitric oxide, compensated for the decrements in other immune parameters so that overall resistance to the pathogen was not compromised (Keil et al., 2001) . Heryzk et al. (1997) have developed a testing paradigm that evaluates immune function within the context of resistance to a specific infection. Following infection with Candida albicans, a four-parameter model is used that includes survival, spleen colony forming units (CFU), muscle CFU, and antibody titers, and which the authors suggest allows an inclusive evaluation of both nonspecific, cell-, and humoral-mediated immune responses. This approach has proved successful in identifying both immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory compounds and has the advantage of being able to evaluate multiple immune endpoints in an intact animal and directly relate them to a clinical endpoint.

While precise information is not readily available, several sources indicate these to be significant and that even small changes in infectious disease frequency has a major impact. The impacts associated with mortality, and to a lesser extent morbidity, from common pathogens such as influenza and pneumonia, have been determined and can serve as a basis in the risk management process. Deaths have the most costly impact on society. In 2000, the age-adjusted death rate for influenza and pneumonia was 23.0 and 0.6 per 100,000, respectively, based on the 10 th Revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10 th Revision coding (ICD-10, 1992) . Together these infections were ranked as the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S. for all ages (Anderson, 2002) .

In both years, this number was dominated by pneumonia. Other conditions secondarily related to these illnesses, such as disorders related to low birth weights, respiratory distress, or bacterial sepsis, accounted for higher infant deaths (Minino et al., 2002) , including neonates (<28 days of age); however, influenza and pneumonia still ranked seventh for post neonates (Anderson, 2002) .

Increased incidences of infection with opportunistic microbes can be readily observed in individuals with severe immunodeficiency, such as AIDS when immunological parameters, especially CD4 + cell numbers, are reduced by >50% from control values. 5. It is considerably more difficult to ascertain health consequences from low-tomoderate levels of immunosuppression, as would be most likely to occur from exposure to immunotoxic agents than from severe immunosuppression. There are a number of studies, however, that indicate that these populations are at an increased risk to infection with common pathogens and latent viruses, particularly those from the Herpes family, but not to opportunistic infections.
