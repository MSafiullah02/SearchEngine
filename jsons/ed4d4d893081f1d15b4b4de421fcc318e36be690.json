Key technologies of physical protection against biological contamination were described in terms of isolation, positive/negative pressure, air filtration, antibacterial material and disinfection. Present situation of research and development about Chinese physical protection equipment against biological contamination were presented involving individual protection, collective protection, disinfections, quality control and ergonomics. Finally, Chinese and overseas status about physical protection equipment against biological contamination were analyzed and compared in the areas of administration, research and market. It was concluded that Chinese physical protection equipment against biological contamination fell behind in administration, research and industrialization. As a result, some suggestions with Chinese characteristics were presented to promote development of Chinese physical protection equipment against biological contamination.",

Accompanied by the variety of natural ecological environment, international military and political situation, biological contamination has performed as various forms, such as biological warfare agents, biological terrorist attacks, emergent natural epidemic and biological incidents, etc. Therefore, biological safety has become a hot issue in the world. As an example of SARS epidemic in the spring and summer of 2003, involving 32 countries and regions, there were total 8422 cases around the world, 919 cases of death, 11% of mortality rate. Mainland of China had total 5,327 cases, 349 cases of death, and 6.6% of mortality rate. In particular, there were up to 1,016 cases of infection, 31 cases of death for the medical staff in the rescue of SARS patients, which respectively covered 19% of total domestic infection cases and 8.9% of death cases [1] . This high infection rate caused a great panic among the people, which seriously influenced the social stability and economic development. The worldwide economic losses caused by SARS were up to about 59 billion US dollars (17.9 billion US dollars of China) [2] . Since the end of 2003, the avian influenza spread in the world, involving 13 countries and regions, which had 348 cases of human infection, 215 cases of death with 62% of mortality as well as 3 billion US dollars of economic losses [3] . After entering the 21st century, the importance of national biological safety is nothing less than any other form of national security. Hence, developing protection technology and equipment against biological contamination to minimize people infections and deaths has become an important task for all countries.",

The government shall establish a full range of management systems, mechanisms, policies and regulations, such as early warning, response plans, prevention education, technical research, equipment reserves, materials supply, medical aid, and reconstruction after disaster, etc. and become the leading strength for dealing with biohazard events. Suggestions: First, strengthen the scientific research input. Second, strengthen strategic reserves input. Third, establish the technology standard systems, setup quality testing platform and certification institutions, as well as strengthen trade supervision and management. Fourth, combine reserves with rehearsals, and fully exert the performance of biological protection equipment.",

Roberts Isolation Equipment Co., Ltd in the UK, and BACOU company in France, etc.It also established various academic organizations at abroad, which played an important role to guide the development of biological protection technology and equipment.For example, Biological Terrorism Incidents Nursing Research Group under the Emergency Nursing Association (ENA) of the United States established in 1970, American Biological Safety Association (ABSA) established in 1984, European Biological Safety Association (EBSA) established in 1996, International Biosafety Working Group (IBWG) Established in Canada in 2001. Biological protection equipment research and development in China was almost blank before SARS, In December 2003, National Biological Protection Equipment Engineering Center (NPEC) was established based on Academy of Military Medical Science approved by the Ministry of Science and Technology. In October 2007, NPEC, Academy of Military Medical Science, and China Disease Prevention and Control Center co-established the Biological Safety and Protection Equipment Branch of Chinese Preventive Medicine Association.",
