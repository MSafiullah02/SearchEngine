Because some prognostic factors were only available for a subset of approximately 30% of the patients in Hong Kong and 60% of the patients in Toronto,20 we used multiple imputation to make best use of all available data in the propensity score model.27, 28, 29, 30 Ten datasets were constructed on the basis of all clinical, demographic, and outcome variables with imputed values based on a generalized additive model and predictive mean matching (function aregImpute in R library Hmisc). We used chi-square tests to evaluate whether the propensity scores were able to balance observed covariates across treatment groups. We then weighted the observed individual outcome by the inverse estimated propensity scores to infer adjusted case fatality ratios in each treatment arm.26 We used case-resampling bootstrap with 1000 repetitions in each imputed dataset to estimate 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the case fatality ratios.31\n",

This study used propensity score methods to estimate the effectiveness of ribavirin and corticosteroids for severe acute respiratory syndrome early in the course of disease, adjusting for differences in patient characteristics between treatment arms.11 For example, the most significant factors associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome fatality in Hong Kong are age more than 60 years old, preexisting comorbid conditions, and non-health care worker status,19, 33 all of which were more commonly present for patients not receiving ribavirin or corticosteroids (Table 1). The high crude case fatality ratio for patients receiving neither treatment was likely because of this case mix that was fully adjusted in our propensity score analysis.12\n",

Without detailed data on clinical progression, which we do not have, we cannot assess the potential benefits of therapies later in the clinical course and in particular as rescue treatment. It is always easier to act with the benefit of hindsight, and our results should not be taken as a criticism of those early prescribing decision but rather as an evaluation of treatment strategies based on information that has since become available. This also points to the need for common data-collection protocols and specification of a standardized dataset (or minimum dataset), which may facilitate integration of data during the initial period of epidemics and allow more comprehensive retrospective analyses after epidemics.",

However, given that our analysis included and balanced the most important variables that have been identified as predictive of survival,20, 34, 51 the best effort was made to control for potential confounders. Our data on treatment assignments are limited to information on the first date of ribavirin use and the first date of corticosteroid use; therefore, we have been unable to investigate alternative strategies of treatment administration, for example, whether corticosteroids were pulsed or not or variations in dosage or duration of treatment. We do not have data on other treatments, such as lopinavir/ritonavir, which was associated with improved clinical outcomes in a small uncontrolled study,52 or traditional Chinese medicine.53 The main analyses were based on treatment choice within 2 days of admission; however, results were consistent when treatment within 1, 3, 4, or 5 days of admission was considered. A further limitation is the presence of substantial proportions of missing data on some clinical variables. We implemented multiple imputation to use all available data in the analysis, which is considered the gold standard approach,54 and the estimated treatment effects were consistent with those estimated in a complete case analysis (data not shown). Another limitation is that outcomes other than death were not considered; common side effects such as avascular necrosis due to corticosteroid therapy might have a significant impact on long-term quality of life, but such outcomes were not considered in this study.48, 49 A more complete comparison between treatments should consider both nonfatal adverse drug effects and quality of life. A complete dataset including disease progression and all clinical events (eg, ventilation) was not available. Finally, our analyses were based on patients with probable severe acute respiratory syndrome according to the World Health Organization definition.55 We adopted this definition rather than laboratory confirmation because the latter definition may be potentially biased toward including more survivors, particularly in the early cases.19\n",

In the absence of further evidence, clinicians should not use ribavirin and corticosteroids to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome because to the best of our knowledge, they provide no benefit in terms of survival. Investigators should consider other promising therapies in the event of another outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, and ideally protocols would be in place to evaluate alternative treatments in randomized trials.",
