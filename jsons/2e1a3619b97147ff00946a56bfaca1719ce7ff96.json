We collected fruit bodies belonging to ectomycorrhizal-basidiomycete families and genera, sampled the woody vegetation, and described soils and landforms at 11 permanent sampling stations. We first calculated similarity matrices among stations, one for each descriptor (fungal species abundance, woody species abundance, and abiotic variables). We then explored the dependence among these matrices using Mantel and partial Mantel tests, path analysis, and comparisons of ordinations and classifications. Similarity among ectomycorrhizal fungus communities was strongly and significantly correlated with tree community similarity, even when controlling for the effect of environmental similarity. When the tests were made with a similarity matrix based on those tree species that are known to be hosts of ectomycorrhizal fungi, abiotic similarity explained a significant portion of the residual variation in the similarity among fungus communities. To explore this complex relationship further, we analyzed species associations. The preference of fungus associations for different sets of abiotic conditions showed that some factors affecting fungal species distribution were different from those affecting the distribution of their tree hosts. Direct and indirect gradient analyses showed that humus characteristics seemed to be important niche dimensions of ectomycorrhizal fungi. The continuum concept was useful to interpret the complex relations among symbiotic species. Trees were the main component of the realized niche of ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycetes, but the fungal symbionts of a particular tree species followed that tree species for only a part of the abiotic gradients over which the host tree was found. This type of distribution predicts that beta diversity of fungi would be generally higher than beta diversity of ectomycorrhizae-forming trees. It also means that the ratio of fungus species richness to woody species richness would be high for most community gradients. Our results and those of previous mycosynecological studies agree with these predictions. The results have implications for the conservation of biodiversity: site selection for conservation based on vegetation classification or mapping, or on distribution of tree species, may miss important fungal species.",

            "text": "Synecology of macrofungi has been investigated mostly by European mycologists (Cooke 1948 , 1979 , Hueck 1953 , Apinis 1972 , Darimont 1973 . Many of these studies were inspired by the \"floristic-sociological approach\" that had been developed with vascular plants. Results show generally a high fidelity of many fungus species for particular plant associations (e.g., Lisiewska 1974) . However, the different ecophysiological groups of fungi (saprotrophes, mycorrhizae, parasites) play quite different roles in an ecosystem and are linked in different ways to the host plant that affect the composition and structure of EBC at a small ecological scale. Trees-fungi-environment relationships were treated as a problem of multiple correspondence between three matrices (descriptors by sampling station) where the descriptors were: (I) woody species abundance (including the different growth stages of the trees); (2) ectomycorrhizal-basidiomycete species abundance, evaluated using the frequency and biomass of basidiomata (sporophores of Basidiomycetes; \"fruit bodies\"); and (3) the environmental variables. We measured the relationship between such matrices using a two-step procedure: (I) computation of similarity matrices among stations, one for each type of data, and (2) computation of a series of: (i) correlations between all combinations of two of these similarity matrices, and (ii) partial correlations between the same pairs of matrices, removing the effect of the third one. This last step involved Mantel tests (Mantel 1967 ) as well as partial Mantel tests as described in Smouse et al. (1986) . The reasoning behind this approach is the following: if the composition ofEBC depends upon the composition of the tree community, then when a pair of tree communities are similar, the EBC of the same two sample stations should also be similar to the same extent. This approach was needed to provide an objective measure of the strength of the association between taxocenes and an unequivocal way to interpret it. To our knowledge, our work represents the first direct and quantitative approach to this problem.",

Tlie climate is continental-temperate: the mean annual temperature is 2.5\u00b0C (maximum: l0\u00b0C, minimum: -2SC), total annual precipitation is 1000 mm, thermic amplitude is 32\u00b0C with a mean number of 110 d without frost (Wilson 1971 , Houde 1978 . The site, with an undulating and mountainous relief, lies on the southern flank ofthe Precambrian Shield. Soil parent material is mostly glacial till, but organic soils are common. The domi-nant soils are ferro-humic podzols (Commission canadienne de pedologie 1978) with a sandy-loam texture. In Grandtner's classification of Quebec forests (1966) the climax vegetation of the site is yellow birch-maple. Today, it is dominated by white birch (Betula papyrifera) stands mixed with sugar maple (Acer saccharum) that occupy mesic sites disturbed in the past by cutting and fire (Gagnon 197 5) . Pure sugar maple stands mixed with yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis) and beech (Fagus grandifolia) are mostly found in mesic areas where the till is thick and where the disturbances have been minor. White pine (Pinus strobus) stands and balsam fir (Abies balsamea) stands occupy rapidly drained sites where soil is thin. Organic soils are colonized by boggy vegetation in most places, but Thuja occidentalis stands have developed on organic soils localized at the bases of seepage slopes.",

To record the color of mineral horizons, we took fresh samples and used the Munsell code of colors (Munsell Color Company 1969) . We measured pH with fresh soils, <24 h after the sampling, using a Metrohm Herisau pH meter and a 0.01 mol/L CaCl2 solution.

All three similarity matrices were used to compute classifications and ordinations. The latter were done through principal coordinate analyses (PCOA). We chose this technique to project, on an orthogonal system of axes, the similarities among samples that have been described above. For the cluster analyses of community samples, we used hierarchical, agglomerative, proportional-link linkage clustering, with connectedness between 0.50 and 0.60. These values of connectedness were chosen to overcome the chaining phenomenon (Legendre and Legendre 1983) . Results of the classifications were superimposed on the first two axes of the PCOA. We also placed the sampling stations on the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the clusters. MST is defined (in a single linkage clustering) as the chain formed by the first similarity link that put an object in a group or that allows two groups to merge Ross 1969, Legendre and Legendre 1983) . In his computer program for cluster analysis, Legendre (1985) generalizes this concept to the other agglomerative clustering methods. This superimposition was useful to visually compare the structure of the two related taxocenes. To produce abiotic groups of sampling stations, we used a K-means algorithm (MacQueen 1967) with the three first axes of PCOA extracted from the abiotic similarity matrix as the input variables. To associate each station group with the set of abiotic characteristics that caused it, we computed Kendall's nonparametric correlations between the two first axes of the ordination and the environmental variables. We also computed the average of each abiotic variable within each group.",

CCA is a technique that selects the linear combination of environmental variables that maximizes the dispersion of species scores. We used it because, unlike PCOA, it is able to detect unimodal relationships between species and external variables (ter Braak 1988) . We took as the external variables the ones that describe the mineral horizons of the soil, in order to see the different responses of the two taxocenes to the same gradient. The rest of the abiotic variables were correlated with this edaphic gradient after the extraction of the axes. We also computed partial correlations between abiotic variables and the two first axes of the CCA of fungal communities, removing the effect of the corresponding axes of the tree communities. This allowed us to identify the abiotic variables that might influence the distribution of Basidiomycetes independently from the effect of the composition of their associated tree community.",

Each of these combinations reflects a particular ecological situation. If abiotic conditions strongly influenced both tree community composition and EBC composition (directly or via their effect on tree communities), then the most common situations should have been the first two. With those remarks in mind, the position of some station pairs and some individual stations is worth noticing. Station 2, for example, shared few abiotic conditions and tree species with stations 4 and 5, but the EBC of the three had many species in common. White birch (Betula papyrifera) was the main tree species growing at the three stations, and it is possible that the EBC was mostly affected by the presence of this species despite the widely different physical properties of their substrate. This would suggest that many ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycetes associated with white birch were indifferent to some soil properties like texture and water content. It can also mean that in the past (before disturbances) the tree community of station 2 had shared more species with stations 4 and 5 than it did when we sampled it. The ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycetes may then have persisted in the station while their associated trees had disappeared. Indeed, we found that burned stumps belonged to coniferous species in station 2 while there were but a few weak saplings of balsam fir (Abies balsamea) growing at the station or around it when we sampled. In his field observations of Salix repens communities in the British Isles, Watling (1981) concluded that the species composition of an EBC is influenced not only by the present composition of the tree community but also by its past composition.",

However, the EBC composition could have also been affected by drainage since water availability is identified as a limiting factor of ectomycorrhizal development (references in Slankis 197 4 and Bowen 1972) . Moreover, trees that grow on soils where the mineral soil does not retain water well may depend more on ectomycorrhizae for their water supply (Slankis 197 4). In our sample, more rapidly drained stations were also richer in ectomycorrhizae-forming trees. Also, as an indirect effect of plant community composition or not, the humus of those stations had a higher percentage of organic matter (loss on ignition), a characteristic identified as favorable for ectomycorrhizal formation (Slankis 1974) . On the other hand, mesic stations were usually dominated by Acer saccharum, a non-ectomycorrhized species, and the humus it created had a lower percentage of organic matter.",

Also, while some abiotic conditions influencing tree community structure were the same as those affecting fungal communities, the responses of fungi seem to have differed from those of their tree symbionts. The effect of drainage is a good example of this. The same phenomenon involving the soil acidity was observed by Kotlaba (1953) , who studied macromycetes communities of peat bogs in Czechoslovakia. He stated that some ectomycorrhizal species avoid peat bogs although their tree hosts are present. Others, which he called \"acidophilic\" species, follow their tree symbionts wherever they grow. Moreover, it is known (Slankis 1974 ) that ectomycorrhizae formation occurs mainly when nutritional conditions for the tree associate are suboptimal. This may partly explain why many ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycetes seem to have avoided rich mesic stations, a phenomenon observed by other researchers (Ubrizsy 1972) .",

This would mean a lot of basidiomata to identify, a difficult task in the absence of taxonomic monographs on complex genera such as Cortinarius and Russula. However, an ecological investigation can be coupled with taxonomic work if restricted to one family or a few genera. In this perspective, collecting in permanent plots may provide good material for an understanding of morphological variations within species. On the other hand, the ecological investigation requires that all material be identified, including damaged basidiomata.
