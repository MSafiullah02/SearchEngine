The substantial heterogeneity in clinical course and CNS pathology between MS patients suggests a multifactorial disease cause. More specifically, four main lesion patterns were found in a large number CNS samples from MS patients collected in three different centers from Austria, Germany, and the USA [2]. Two patterns reveal close similarity to the T-cell mediated (type I) or T-cell and antibody-induced (type II) encephalomyelitis observed in experimental animal systems. In these types a central role of (auto)immune reactions in lesion formation is likely. In patterns III and IV oligodendrocyte loss by viral infection or exposure to toxic agents seems a more likely primary cause of lesion formation. The fact that all lesions within one patient fall within one category suggests that the four lesion types may represent different forms of MS.",

However, none of these have been identified as exclusive trigger of MS. Viruses may induce myelin damage through a number of mechanisms either directly or indirectly 34, 35. An example of a neuroinvasive virus that directly infects and damages oligodendrocytes and myelin is JC virus [36]. Other viruses may incorporate host cell antigens, such as myelin proteins, into the viral envelope thereby allowing the peripheral immune recognition of CNS restricted antigens [37]. A third possible mechanism is that the autoreactive T cells respond to mimicry motifs of myelin antigens in viral proteins [38]. As a general reaction to tissue damage, including cytolytic viral infection, myelin is phagocytosed and processed either locally [38] or carried to the cervical lymph nodes (CLN), which drain the cerebrospinal and interstitial fluids of the brain, where myelin-reactive T cells and B cells are activated de novo\n39, 40, 41.",

In both models demyelination is immune mediated, although myelin-reactive T cells play a major but not exclusive role in the pathogenesis of disease. The pathogenic mechanisms in these models include the persistence of virus within the CNS and the induction of myelin-reactive T cells and antibodies via molecular mimicry. The specificities and functions (pro- or anti-inflammatory) of the repertoire of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is determined by the interaction of multiple genes.

The success rate of EAE induction by adoptive transfer of MBP-specific T helper 1 cells in nonhuman primates is high in common marmosets [26], but it is much lower in rhesus monkeys [27].

Molecules of the size of antibodies and complement factors can gain access to the CNS via the vasogenic edema at sites where the BBB leaks [55]. Among the various myelin and non-myelin antigens that have been implicated in the MS immuno-pathogenesis, the minor myelin protein myelin/oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) has now emerged as a likely primary target of the autoimmune reaction. MOG is exclusively located in the CNS where, by its exposure on the outer surface of myelin sheaths and oligodendrocytes, the protein is directly accessible to infiltrating T cells and antibodies. Several groups have reported an increased incidence and more persistent activity of anti-MOG T cells or antibodies in MS than in patients with other inflammatory neurologic diseases or healthy controls. In a variety of animal species (mice, rats, and primates) experimentally-induced autoimmune reactions to MOG give rise to similar clinical and neuropathologic features as found in MS 56, 57. In both MS and the marmoset model of EAE, anti-MOG antibodies were found localized in areas where pathologic changes of white matter occur [58]. Moreover, a pathogenic role for anti-MOG antibodies has been demonstrated in rats [59], mice [60], and marmosets [61]. In all three studies it was found that, whereas transfer of antimyelin T cells induces CNS inflammation, the induction of demyelination likely requires the presence of anti-MOG antibodies binding to conformational epitopes on the MOG molecule ([62] and own unpublished observations). It can be envisaged that once an initial lesion has been formed normally sequestered myelin antigens, such as MBP and PLP, become exposed and accessible for antibody binding.",

One mechanism that may induce anti-MOG antibodies is a similar molecular mimicry mechanism, as discussed above for T cells, namely that protein conformations in a virus induce antibodies to similar conformations in MOG [63].

We have recently found a candidate mimicry motif shared by dominant epitopes of MOG and cytomegalovirus (manuscript in preparation). Preliminary data indicate that the virus is locally released from the infiltrated cells and infects CNS cells. We hypothesize that the infected CNS cells are destroyed by infiltrating anti-viral cytotoxic T cells and antibodies.

In these models the neoreactivities even overgrow the T-cell autoreactivities that initiated the disease [73]. The activation of a na\u00efve repertoire of T cells responding to spreading epitopes/antigens likely takes place outside the brain, as T cells activated within the CNS do not likely escape to the circulation 74, 75. It has been well established in rats that myelin antigens released from an experimentally induced cryolesion in the brain white matter are drained to the T- and B-cell areas of the CLN, which drain the cerebrospinal and interstitial fluids from the brain 39, 40. In the cryolesion model, myelin-reactive T cells activated within CLN were found to preferentially home to the brain and to enhance MBP-induced EAE in syngeneic rats [76]. This suggests that during their priming within CLN (antimyelin) T cells may receive instructions to traffic to the CNS white matter and enhance inflammatory demyelination. In this context the finding that the CLN of EAE-affected marmosets and rhesus monkeys contain significant numbers of APC loaded with immunoreactive myelin antigens (MBP and PLP) is of particular interest [41]. Such activated myelin-loaded APC were lacking in the CLN of monkeys with a nonrelated autoimmune disease, such as collagen-induced arthritis.",

This stress protein was found to be expressed in MS lesions and to represent a potential autoantigen in MS [70]. In our model, myelin damage caused by different pathogenic mechanisms, including an anti-viral immune response or an autoimmune attack, may all give rise to the CLN immigration of activated APC. The APC are not only localized in the CLN areas where T- and B-cell priming can take place but also express high levels of MHC and costimulatory molecules. Therefore, we assume that the APC can potentially induce T- and B-cell neoreactivities directed to the score of myelin and nonmyelin antigens in the white matter material that they have phagocytosed during CNS demyelination.",

Conceptually, activation of a latent infection in individuals with a genetic risk phenotype may exacerbate MS via T cells that respond, for example, to a mimicry motif shared by herpes simplex virus 1 and MBP [91] or one shared by cytomegalovirus and MOG (\u2019t Hart et al., manuscript in preparation).",
