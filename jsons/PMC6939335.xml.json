Chung et al. reported that dexmedetomidine significantly reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and ameliorated renal dysfunction among mice in the septic AKI model [17]. Additionally, Kai et al. reported that dexmedetomidine suppressed the expression of sepsis-induced inflammatory factors, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6, and reduced tubular apoptosis in mice [18]. Dexmedetomidine was also reported to reduce the level of norepinephrine in the blood, resulting in an increase in renal blood flow and urinary output [19]. The results of the present study suggest that dexmedetomidine might improve sepsis-induced AKI through the attenuation of an excessive inflammatory response or sympathetic tone. However, we could not confirm this hypothesis because we could not evaluate the inflammatory response in the present study.",

            "text": "Our study has several limitations. The most critical limitation is that this study is a post hoc subgroup analysis enrolling with higher APACHE II score that results in the differences in baseline characteristics between groups. Conceptually, the randomized design of this study could also balance baseline characteristics in this subgroup. Therefore, these differences between groups might occur by chance. In addition, because the sample size was not adequately large to conduct multivariable analyses, we did not adjust the baseline characteristics. In fact, the initial total SOFA score and coagulation SOFA score were significantly higher in the non-DEX group than those in the DEX group. More severe coagulation abnormality might increase the mortality in the non-DEX group which was reported in a previous study [23]. However, at least, the difference of the initial coagulation SOFA score did not directly influence the evaluation of the renal component of the SOFA score, because the initial renal component of the SOFA score did not differ. Therefore, the results of our study should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating which should be confirmed through future studies. Second, our study was a post hoc analysis and applied multiple comparisons for exploratory purposes. The difference in the renal component might be due to chance. It is necessary to evaluate our findings in further well-designed studies. Third, we could not evaluate the mechanisms in other organs besides those included in the SOFA score. The SOFA score was developed to provide a rough assessment of each organ dysfunction; therefore, we could not detect minor organ dysfunctions using the SOFA score. We may, therefore, have missed identifying the mechanism underlying the improved outcome, besides renal protection. For instance, dexmedetomidine was reported to modulate inflammation or liver dysfunction [4\u20136]. Fourth, we collected and analyzed the data of absolute changes in each organ component of the SOFA score only in 60% of the patients on day 6 in both groups as shown in Table 2. Because the data of deceased patients were excluded and data of patients discharged from ICU were missing, the number of patients\u2019 data on day 6 decreased. Therefore, it might not be appropriate to conclude that dexmedetomidine affected organ dysfunction in the DEX group.",
