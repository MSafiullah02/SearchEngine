Community surveillance could mitigate delays in reporting, allow for timely collection of respiratory tract samples, and characterize cases of non-medically attended ILI representing substantial personal and economic burden. Text messaging could be utilized to perform longitudinal ILI surveillance in a communitybased sample but has not been assessed. We recruited 161 households (789 people) in New York City for a study of mobile ARI/ILI surveillance, and selected reporters received text messages twice weekly inquiring whether anyone in the household was ill. Home visits were conducted to obtain nasal swabs from persons with ARI/ILI. Participants were primarily female, Latino, and publicly insured. During the 44-week period from December 2012 through September 2013, 11,282 text messages were sent. In responses to 8,250 (73.1%) messages, a household reported either that someone was ill or no one was ill; 88.9% of responses were received within 4 hours. Swabs were obtained for 361 of 363 reported ARI/ILI episodes. The median time from symptom onset to nasal swab was 2 days; 65.4% of samples were positive for a respiratory pathogen by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.

However, these strategies have not been fully validated (28) , and they can only collect aggregate data without any specific details about any 1 individual's illness. More importantly, these strategies monitor trends of people discussing or searching for ARI-/ILI-related subject matter, and as such there cannot be confirmation of symptoms. Additionally, samples cannot be obtained to confirm an infectious etiology; confirmation of ARI/ILI etiology is important, since there is poor correlation between ILI symptoms and actual laboratory-confirmed influenza (29) .

However, in this study there was no difference in the detection of a respiratory viral pathogen among samples obtained within 72 hours of symptom onset and samples obtained after 72 hours; this finding may be due to the ability of polymerase chain reaction assays to detect small amounts of virus or nonviable virus after several days of illness.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 225, "end": 229, "text": "(25)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 230, "end": 234, "text": "(26)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 235, "end": 239, "text": "(27)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 336, "end": 340, "text": "(28)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 840, "end": 844, "text": "(29)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "There were limitations to this study.

We do not know the extent to which compensation paid to participating households may have contributed to reporting rates. The issues associated with compensation for participating in ongoing active surveillance are likely to be the same regardless of the data collection method utilized. However, reaching and tracking each household by phone is more timeconsuming than sending 1 batch of text messages simultaneously and following up via phone solely with those who report symptoms. It also may be more burdensome and intrusive for families to have to answer a phone call as opposed to returning a text message at a time that is convenient for them. In addition, tracking of phone calls requires more data entry than tracking of text message replies, which can be automatically retrieved from the text message platform. In future studies, investigators could assess differences in reporting and costs for phone reporting versus text messaging.
