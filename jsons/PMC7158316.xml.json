Horses are an exception in that they do not release reticulocytes into circulation, even in situations of increased demand. Unlike mature erythrocytes, which lack organelles, reticulocytes still contain ribosomes and mitochondria, mainly to support completion of hemoglobin synthesis. These remaining organelles impart a bluish-purple cast (polychromasia) to reticulocytes on routine blood smear examination. The resultant cells are termed polychromatophils. Because older reticulocytes do not exhibit polychromasia, more sensitive laboratory techniques must be used for accurate reticulocyte quantification. When a blood sample is incubated with new methylene blue stain, the reticulocytes' ribosomal RNA precipitates to form irregular, dark aggregates (Fig. 13-5\n). Cats also have a more mature form of reticulocyte, termed punctate reticulocyte, which is stippled when stained with new methylene blue. Punctate reticulocytes indicate prior, not active, regeneration and do not appear polychromatophilic on routine blood smear evaluation.",

When erythrocytes reach the end of their life span, they are destroyed in a process termed hemolysis. Hemolysis may occur within blood vessels (intravascular hemolysis) or by sinusoidal macrophages (extravascular hemolysis). During intravascular hemolysis, erythrocytes release their contents, mostly hemoglobin, directly into blood. However, during extravascular hemolysis, macrophages phagocytize entire erythrocytes, leaving little or no hemoglobin in the blood. Normal turnover of erythrocytes occurs mainly by extravascular hemolysis within the spleen, and to a lesser extent in other organs such as the liver and bone marrow. The exact controls are not clear, but factors that likely play a role in physiologic hemolysis include the following:\u2022Exposure of membrane components normally sequestered on the inner leaflet of the erythrocyte membrane, particularly phosphatidylserine.\u2022Decreased erythrocyte deformability.\u2022Binding of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and/or complement to erythrocyte membranes.

Disorders of primary hemostasis typically result in \u201csmall bleeds\u201d (e.g., petechiation, mild ecchymosis, bleeding from mucous membranes, bleeding immediately after venipuncture), whereas disorders of secondary hemostasis typically result in \u201cbig bleeds\u201d (e.g., hemorrhage into body cavities/joints, marked ecchymosis, large hematomas, delayed bleeding after venipuncture). This chapter concentrates on primary disorders of hemostasis and also covers disseminated intravascular coagulation, which is the secondary condition. However, it is important to note that coagulation disorders can also result from other underlying disease processes. For example, advanced liver disease can lead to abnormal hemostasis through decreased or defective synthesis of coagulation factors or impaired clearance of fibrinolytic products that inhibit coagulation reactions and platelet function. Vascular disorders may also result in a bleeding tendency because of abnormalities of endothelial function or collagen-platelet interactions.

Dysplasia, hypoplasia, and aplasia may be specific for one cell line, such as pure red cell aplasia, or affect multiple lineages, as seen with aplastic anemia. Accordingly, decreased blood concentrations of the involved cell types are expected with hypoplasia or aplasia. Erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic hypoplasia or aplasia causes nonregenerative anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, respectively. Bicytopenia is used to describe decreased blood concentrations of two cell lines, whereas pancytopenia indicates decreased blood concentrations of all three cell types. Bicytopenia or pancytopenia may indicate generalized marrow disease, such as occurs with aplastic anemia or marrow malignancies (leukemia), necrosis, fibrosis (myelofibrosis), or inflammation (myelitis).

Disease pathogenesis is unclear, but there are two leading theories. First, it may represent scar formation after marrow necrosis, as previously presented. And second, high concentrations of growth factors present during times of marrow injury or activation may stimulate fibroblast proliferation. In particular, stimulated megakaryocytes and macrophages produce fibrogenic cytokines, including platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor-\u03b2, and epidermal growth factor. Early in disease there is reticulin deposition without reduction of hematopoietic elements. However, fibrous collagen replaces hematopoietic cells with disease progression. Histologic identification of reticulin and collagen fibers can be aided with reticulin silver and Masson's trichrome stains, respectively. In animals, secondary myelofibrosis occurs most commonly with leukemias, extramarrow malignancies, and chronic hemolytic anemias, but many cases are idiopathic. Experimental whole-body gamma irradiation, dietary strontium-90 exposure, and certain drugs and toxins can also induce myelofibrosis.",

Reticulocytosis is an appropriate marrow response to anemia and is often seen with hemorrhage or hemolysis. On a CBC a strong regenerative response may produce an increased mean cell volume (MCV) and decreased mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) because reticulocytes are larger and have a lower hemoglobin concentration than mature erythrocytes. Horses are an exception to this classification scheme because they do not release reticulocytes into circulation, even with erythroid hyperplasia.

One of the main effects of Epo is to expand the pool of early-stage erythroid precursors, and it takes time for these cells to differentiate to the point where they are released into circulation. In a case of acute hemorrhage or hemolysis, for example, it typically takes 3 to 4 days until reticulocytosis is evident on the CBC and several more days until the regenerative response peaks. The term preregenerative anemia is sometimes used to describe anemia with a regenerative response that is impending but not yet apparent on the CBC.

Cell-free hemoglobin is scavenged by haptoglobin until haptoglobin becomes saturated with hemoglobin at a concentration of approximately 150 mg/dL. When haptoglobin is saturated, any remaining free hemoglobin has a low enough molecular weight to pass through the renal glomerular filter into the urine. This imparts a pink or red discoloration to the urine, called hemoglobinuria. Thus extracellular hemoglobin can cause gross discoloration of the plasma, where it is bound to haptoglobin, before becoming grossly visible in urine. The half-life of haptoglobin is markedly decreased when bound to hemoglobin, so when large amounts of haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex are formed, the concentration of haptoglobin in the blood decreases and hemoglobin can pass through the glomerulus at even lower concentrations. Hemoglobinuria is a contributing factor in the renal tubular necrosis (hemoglobinuric nephrosis) that often occurs in cases of acute intravascular hemolysis (see Chapter 11).

Spherocytes form when macrophages (mainly in the spleen) phagocytize part of an erythrocyte plasma membrane bound with autoantibody (Fig. 13-12\n). The remaining portion of the erythrocyte assumes a spherical shape, thus preserving maximal volume. This change in shape results in decreased deformability of the cells. Erythrocytes must be extremely pliable to traverse the splenic red pulp and sinusoidal walls; spherocytes therefore tend to be retained in the spleen in close association with macrophages with risk for further injury and eventual destruction. In the dog, spherocytes appear smaller than normal and have uniform staining (Fig. 13-13, A\n), in contrast to normal erythrocytes, which have a region of central pallor imparted by their biconcave shape. This difference in staining between spherocytes and normal erythrocytes is not consistently discernible in many other domestic animals (including horses, cattle, and cats), whose erythrocytes differ from those of the dog in that they are smaller and have less pronounced biconcavity and therefore less pronounced central pallor. Autoagglutination occurs because of cross-linking of antibodies bound to erythrocytes (see Fig 13-12). Autoagglutination is evident macroscopically as blood with a grainy consistency (see Fig. 13-13, B), and microscopically as clusters of erythrocytes (see Fig. 13-13, C). Autoagglutination may also result in a falsely increased MCV and decreased red blood cell concentration when clustered cells are mistakenly counted as single cells by automated hematology analyzers. When autoagglutination is present, the packed-cell volume is the most reliable measurement of red blood cell mass.",

It has long been known that patients with inflammatory or other chronic disease often become anemic, and that this condition results in increased iron stores in the bone marrow. Sequestration of iron may be a bacteriostatic evolutionary adaptation because many bacteria require iron as a cofactor for growth. In recent years, investigators have begun to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying anemia of inflammation. Hepcidin, an acute phase protein and antimicrobial peptide synthesized in the liver, is a key mediator that limits iron availability. Hepcidin expression increases with inflammation, infection, or iron overload and decreases with anemia or hypoxia. Hepcidin exerts its effects by causing functional iron deficiency. It binds to and causes the degradation of the cell surface iron efflux molecule, ferroportin, thus inhibiting both absorption of dietary iron from the intestinal epithelium and export of iron from macrophages and hepatocytes into the plasma (Fig. 13-16\n).",

Not all inflammatory responses have a left shift, but the presence of a left shift almost always signifies active demand for neutrophils in the tissue. The magnitude of a left shift is assessed by the number of immature cells and their degree of immaturity. The mildest form is characterized by increased numbers of band neutrophils, the immediate predecessor to the segmented neutrophil normally found in circulation. Progressively immature predecessors are seen with increasingly severe inflammation. A left shift is considered orderly if the number of immature neutrophils in circulation decreases as they become progressively immature.

Within the blood vessels, circulating neutrophils are on the highway, and marginating neutrophils are temporarily pulled off to the side of the road. During health, there is an even flow of neutrophils from the factory to the customer. Thus the system is in steady state, and neutrophil numbers remain relatively constant and within the normal range. However, disease states may perturb this system at multiple levels. Decreased granulopoiesis is analogous to a factory working below normal production level. Ineffective granulopoiesis is analogous to goods that are produced at a normal to increased rate but are damaged during manufacturing and never leave the factory. A left shift is analogous to the factory meeting increased customer demand by shipping out unfinished goods.

Factors that may contribute to reactive thrombocytosis include increased plasma concentration of thrombopoietin, inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6), or catecholamines. Thrombocytosis may also occur as part of a regenerative response in patients recovering from thrombocytopenia, as a result of redistribution after splenic contraction, or within the several weeks after splenectomy. In these cases, thrombocytosis is transient. In the case of splenectomy, thrombocytosis may be marked but normalizes after several weeks. Because the body's total platelet mass regulates thrombopoiesis, and a significant portion of the platelet mass is normally in the spleen, it makes sense that splenectomized animals develop thrombocytosis.

Because this is not pathologic lymphocytosis, but normal physiologic variation, it is often termed pseudolymphocytosis of young animals. As discussed earlier in the section on neutrophilia, lymphocytosis is also a feature of epinephrine-mediated physiologic leukocytosis, resulting from redistribution of lymphocytes from the blood marginating pool into the blood circulating pool. Epinephrine-mediated lymphocytosis may be more marked than neutrophilia, particularly in cats (lymphocyte counts of > 20,000/\u00b5L are not uncommon). Antigenic stimulation may result in lymphocytosis, which may be marked in rare cases (up to approximately 30,000/\u00b5L in dogs and 40,000/\u00b5L in cats); however, this is not usually the case, even when there is clear evidence of increased immunologic activity in lymphoid tissues.

The disease is reported in many dog breeds and fewer cat breeds (e.g., Abyssinian, Somali, and domestic shorthair). Erythrocyte PK deficiency results in decreased ATP production and shortened erythrocyte life spans. In dogs the hemolytic anemia is typically chronic, moderate to severe, extravascular, and strongly regenerative. With chronicity, hemolytic anemia causes enhanced intestinal absorption of iron and subsequent hemosiderosis, especially of the liver and bone marrow.

The disease actually refers to a group of inherited conditions characterized by a quantitative or qualitative deficiency of vWF. This factor is a multimeric glycoprotein that is stored in platelet \u03b1-granules and endothelial cells and circulates as a complex with coagulation factor VIII. Its primary functions are to stabilize factor VIII and mediate platelet binding to other platelets and subendothelial collagen. Although not technically a platelet disorder, von Willebrand disease is often classified as such because it results in a loss of normal platelet function. Different types of von Willebrand disease vary in terms of mode of inheritance and severity of clinical disease. Type I von Willebrand disease is characterized by low plasma vWF concentration but normal multimeric proportions and a mild to moderate clinical bleeding tendency; it has been reported in many dog breeds. Type II von Willebrand disease is characterized by low vWF concentration, absence of large multimers, and a moderate to severe bleeding tendency; it has been reported in German short-haired pointer and German wirehaired pointer dogs. Type III von Willebrand disease is characterized by absence of vWF and a severe bleeding tendency; familial and sporadic cases have been reported in numerous dog breeds. The buccal mucosal bleeding time is prolonged with von Willebrand disease, often with adequate concentrations of platelets and normal prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time (PTT). However, PTT may be mildly prolonged because vWF stabilizes factor VIII, and deficiency of vWF results in enhanced factor VIII degradation.

The most common route of loss is through the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., neoplasia in older animals or hookworm infection in puppies). Chronic blood loss may also be caused by marked ectoparasitism (e.g., pediculosis in cattle or massive flea burden in kittens and puppies), neoplasia in locations other than the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., cutaneous hemangiosarcoma), coagulation disorders, and repeated phlebotomy of blood donor animals. Rapidly growing nursing animals may be iron deficient when compared with adults because milk is an iron-poor diet. In most cases this has little clinical significance (and in fact is normal). An important exception is piglets with no access to iron, which may cause anemia, failure to thrive, and increased mortality. Neonatal piglets are routinely given parenteral iron for this reason. Copper deficiency can cause iron deficiency in ruminants and may occur because of copper-deficient forage or impaired usage of copper by high dietary molybdenum or sulfate.

Because erythrocyte maturation is dependent upon obtaining a critical hemoglobin concentration, maturing erythroid precursors undergo additional cell divisions during iron-deficient states. These additional cell divisions result in small erythrocytes, termed microcytes (see Fig. 13-15, G). However, erythrocytes with low hemoglobin concentrations are produced when microcyte formation can no longer compensate for iron deficiency. The classic hematologic picture with iron deficiency anemia is microcytic (i.e., decreased MCV), hypochromic (i.e., decreased MCHC) anemia. Microcytes and hypochromasia (see Fig. 13-15, G) may also be discernible on blood smear examination as erythrocytes that are abnormally small and paler-staining, respectively. Early iron deficiency anemia is poorly regenerative, whereas continued hemorrhage and iron loss cause nonregenerative anemia.

In postparturient cows, hypophosphatemia results from increased loss of phosphorus in their milk. Insulin therapy may cause hypophosphatemia by shifting phosphorus from the extracellular space to the intracellular space. In either case, marked hypophosphatemia (e.g., 1 mg/dL in cows, or \u2264 1.5 mg/dL in cats) is thought to decrease erythrocyte production of ATP, leading to inadequate energy required for maintenance of membrane and cytoskeletal integrity. An accompanying decrease in reducing capacity and increase in methemoglobin concentration have also been noted in experimental studies of hypophosphatemic hemolytic anemia in dairy cattle, suggesting that oxidative mechanisms may also contribute to anemia. Affected animals are anemic and hemoglobinuric.

Surviving cattle become chronic carriers (and thus reservoirs for infection of other animals) and develop cyclic bacteremia, which is typically not detectable on blood smears. Splenectomy of carrier animals results in marked bacteremia and acute hemolysis. PCR testing is the most sensitive means of identifying animals with low levels of bacteremia.",

Complement factor C3b usually acts as an opsonin that promotes phagocytosis and extravascular hemolysis. However, formation of the complement membrane attack complex on red blood cell surfaces causes intravascular hemolysis; this mechanism more commonly occurs with IgM autoantibodies. Most immunoglobulins implicated in immune-mediated hemolytic anemia are reactive at body temperature (warm hemagglutinins). A smaller portion, usually IgM, are more reactive at lower temperatures, causing a condition known as cold hemagglutinin disease. This results in ischemic necrosis at anatomic extremities (e.g., tips of the ears), where cooling of the circulation causes autoagglutination of erythrocytes and occlusion of the microvasculature. Typically immune-mediated hemolytic anemia targets mature erythrocytes, causing a marked regenerative response.

In horses, neonatal isoerythrolysis occurs as a result of immunosensitization of the dam from exposure to an incompatible blood type inherited from the stallion (e.g., transplacental exposure to fetal blood during pregnancy or mixing of maternal and fetal blood during parturition). A previously mismatched blood transfusion produces the same results. Some equine blood groups are more antigenic than others; in particular, types Aa and Qa are very immunogenic in mares. In cattle, neonatal isoerythrolysis has been caused by vaccination with whole blood products or products containing erythrocyte membrane fragments.

Primary and secondary forms of pure red cell aplasia have been described in dogs and cats. Primary pure red cell aplasia is apparently caused by immune-mediated destruction of early erythroid progenitor cells, a presumption supported by the response of some patients to immunosuppressive therapy and by the detection of antibodies inhibiting erythroid colony formation in vitro in some dogs. Administration of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEpo) has been identified as a cause of secondary pure red cell aplasia in dogs, cats, and horses, presumably caused by induction of antibodies against rhEpo that cross-react with endogenous Epo. Experimentation with the use of species-specific recombinant Epo has produced mixed results. Dogs treated with recombinant canine Epo have not developed pure red cell aplasia. However, in experiments reported thus far involving cats treated with recombinant feline Epo, at least some animals have developed pure red cell aplasia. Parvoviral infection has been suggested as a possible cause of secondary pure red cell aplasia in dogs. Infection with FeLV subgroup C causes secondary erythroid aplasia in cats, probably because of infection of early-stage erythroid precursors. Grossly, animals with pure red cell aplasia have pale mucous membranes without indicators of hemolysis (e.g., icterus). Microscopic examination of the bone marrow shows an absence or near absence of erythroid precursors with or without lymphocytosis, plasmacytosis, and myelofibrosis; production of other cell lines (e.g., neutrophils and platelets) is normal or hyperplastic.",

These activated macrophages phagocytize mature hematopoietic cells and hematopoietic precursors at an enhanced rate, resulting in one or more cytopenias. Affected animals usually have lesions of the primary disease, as well as signs of the anemia (e.g., pale mucous membranes), neutropenia (e.g., bacterial infections), and thrombocytopenia (e.g., petechiae and ecchymoses).

It is common in critically ill domestic animals. Disseminated intravascular coagulation involves an initial hypercoagulable phase, resulting in thrombosis and ischemic tissue damage, and a subsequent hypocoagulable phase as a result of consumption of coagulation factors and platelets, resulting in hemorrhage (E-Fig. 13-5). The pathogenesis of disseminated intravascular coagulation typically involves the release of tissue factor (thromboplastin) and subsequent activation of coagulation pathways and platelets but may also involve defective normal inhibition of coagulation or defective fibrinolysis. Classically diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation is based on clinical evidence of hemorrhage and/or thromboembolic disease and a triad of laboratory findings: thrombocytopenia, usually moderate (below the lower reference value but above 50,000/\u00b5L); prolonged coagulation times (prothrombin time and/or partial thromboplastin time); and decreased fibrinogen or increased concentration of plasma fibrin degradation products or D-dimer. Milder forms of disseminated intravascular coagulation that do not meet all of the diagnostic criteria also occur.

Immunophenotyping refers to the use of antibodies recognizing specific molecules expressed on different cell types to determine the identity of a cell population of interest. Immunophenotyping on the basis of these lineage-specific or lineage-associated markers can be performed on histologic sections (immunohistochemistry [see Fig. 13-86]), air-dried cytologic examination smears (immunocytochemistry), or by laser analysis of cells in suspension in blood or buffer solutions (flow cytometry). In cases of lymphoid neoplasia, immunophenotyping most routinely refers to determination of B or T lymphocyte origin. Clonality assays, PCR for antigen receptor rearrangement (PARR), can help identify neoplastic lymphoid proliferations on the basis of clonal rearrangements of genes encoding lymphocyte antigen receptors. In terms of practical application the PARR assay is most useful in helping to distinguish lymphoid neoplasms from those nonneoplastic lymphoid proliferations mimicking neoplasia. Cytogenetic testing has not been routinely used in veterinary medicine, though several genetic mutations have been identified in dogs. For example, breakpoint cluster region-Abelson (BCR-ABL) translocations have been identified in some canine leukemias, including acute myeloblastic leukemia and chronic monocytic leukemia.

This homogeneous protein fraction is often called paraprotein or M protein. Paraproteins produced from the same clone of plasma cells have the same molecular weight and electric charge. Therefore they have the same migration pattern using serum protein electrophoresis, which results in a tall, narrow spike in the globulins region, termed monoclonal gammopathy (see Fig. 13-32, B). The term gammopathy is used because most immunoglobulins migrate in the \u03b3-region of an electrophoresis gel. However, some immunoglobulins, especially immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgM, migrate to the \u03b2-region. Occasionally, biclonal or other atypical electrophoretic patterns may be seen with multiple myeloma as a result of protein degradation, protein complex formation, binding to other proteins, or when the tumor includes more than one clonal population. It is important to note that monoclonal gammopathy is not specific to multiple myeloma but has also been reported with lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, canine ehrlichiosis, and canine leishmaniasis. Definitively distinguishing monoclonal from polyclonal gammopathy requires immunoelectrophoresis or immunofixation using species-specific antibodies recognizing different immunoglobulin subclasses and subunits.",

The splenic artery enters the splenic capsule at the hilus, where it branches and enters the fibromuscular trabeculae as trabecular arteries to supply the splenic parenchyma. Trabecular arteries become the central arteries of the white pulp and are surrounded by cuffs of T lymphocytes forming the PALS. The splenic follicles, populated by B lymphocytes, are eccentrically embedded within or just adjacent to the PALS. The central arteries send branches\u2014the radial arteries\u2014to supply the marginal sinus surrounding the splenic follicles. Thus the cells at the circumferences of the follicles are brought into intimate contact with blood-borne antigens and trafficking B and T lymphocytes in the marginal sinus. As a result of this pattern of blood flow, macrophages in the marginal sinus have the first opportunity to phagocytize antigens, bacteria, particles, and other material before macrophages in the sinusoids (in the dog) or in the PAMS and red pulp vascular spaces (all other domestic animals). In the dog the marginal sinus drains into the sinusoids, but in other domestic animals it drains into the red pulp vascular spaces.",

Each arteriole is surrounded by a sheath of macrophages known as periarteriolar macrophage sheaths (PAMS, previously known as ellipsoids), which are notably prominent in pigs, dogs, and cats. In horses, cattle, pigs, and cats the terminal branches of the penicillar arterioles empty into the red pulp vascular spaces lined by reticular cells. Because the red pulp vascular spaces are not lined by endothelium, this type of circulation is known as an open system. This system is in contrast to the sinusoidal spleen of the dog (also of the rat and human beings), where the branches of the central artery of the white pulp and vessels from the marginal sinus enter into the sinusoids, which are lined by a discontinuous endothelium, and these empty into splenic venules. This type of circulation is known as a closed system because the blood flow is through blood vessels (arterioles, capillaries, sinusoids, and venules), all of which are lined by endothelium. Although circulation in the red pulp is anatomically open in nonsinusoidal spleens, under certain conditions (e.g., during splenic contraction) the circulation is functionally closed, and the blood in the red pulp is diverted into \u201cchannels\u201d lined by reticular cells. Because the dog has both sinusoids and red pulp vascular spaces, it has both open and closed splenic circulations, which may allow for both fast and slow flows of blood depending on the physiologic need of the animal. Blood flowing through the sinusoids or red pulp vascular spaces is under the surveillance of macrophages. In dogs the pseudopodia of these perisinusoidal macrophages project into the sinusoidal lumen through the spaces in the discontinuous endothelium. In all domestic animals, blood in the red pulp vascular spaces is under surveillance of macrophages attached to the reticular walls. Blood from the red pulp vascular spaces and sinusoids then drains into the splenic venules, splenic veins, and ultimately into the portal vein, which empties into the liver.",

In the dog, macrophages are also located perisinusoidally. The supportive reticular network of the red pulp vascular spaces is composed of a fine meshwork of reticular fibers made of type III collagen, on which macrophages are dispersed. Exactly in which of these concentrations of macrophages phagocytosis of blood-borne particles takes place depends upon (1) the sequence in which they are exposed to the incoming blood, (2) the concentration of macrophages in these areas (e.g., the cat marginal sinus is small and thus not a major site of clearance; there is a compensatory increase in PAMS for phagocytosis), and (3) the functions of the macrophages. Some of the macrophages in the marginal sinus and marginal zone are responsible for phagocytosis of particulate matter and others for the trapping and ingestion of antigens and antigen-antibody complexes. Macrophages responsible for phagocytosis of blood-borne foreign material (Fig. 13-44\n), bacteria, and senescent and/or damaged erythrocytes (e.g., as seen in immune-mediated anemias and infections with hemotropic parasites) are also found in the red pulp. In the dog, sinusoidal macrophages remove entire erythrocytes (erythrophagocytosis), as well as portions of an erythrocyte's membrane and cytoplasmic inclusions, such as nuclear remnants like Heinz bodies, by a process called pitting. As such, the presence of large numbers of nuclear remnants in erythrocytes in canine blood smears may indicate malfunction of the sinusoidal system. The normal rate of removal of senescent erythrocytes from the circulating blood does not cause an increase in size of the spleen; however, splenomegaly can be observed when large numbers of defective erythrocytes must be removed, as in cases of severe acute hemolytic anemia. Nonsinusoidal spleens lack the fenestrated endothelium and perisinusoidal macrophages of canine sinusoids that allow for slow processing of red blood cells to determine which are to be returned to the circulation, pitted, or phagocytized. Instead, the macrophages of the red pulp perform these functions, and phagocytized cells remain in the red pulp vascular spaces. The location of the primary sites of pitting in nonsinusoidal spleens is unclear, but it is likely that most erythrophagocytosis takes place in the red pulp vascular spaces. The cat's spleen is deficient in pitting, and removal of Heinz bodies is slow; however, some erythrophagocytosis does occur in the marginal sinus.",

The fixed macrophages elsewhere in the body, namely, those in connective tissue, lymph nodes (sinus histiocytes), liver (Kupffer cells), lung (pulmonary intravascular macrophages and pulmonary alveolar macrophages), and brain (resident and perivascular microglial cells), are also derived from bone marrow (see Chapters 5, 8, 9, and 14Chapter 5Chapter 8Chapter 9Chapter 14).",

The ability to store blood in the spleen depends on the fibromuscular composition of the splenic capsule and trabeculae. Splenic capsules and trabeculae with a low percentage of smooth muscle and elastic fibers cannot expand and contract and are designated as defense spleens. These are found in rabbits and human beings. The spleens of other domestic animal species have storage and defense functions but are classified as storage spleens because the extensive smooth muscle of the capsule and trabeculae allows the spleen to expand and contract. The spleens of ruminants and pigs are intermediate in their amount of smooth muscle and thus have limited storage capacity. Equine, canine, and feline spleens all have considerable storage and contractile capacity because of their muscular capsule, increased numbers of trabeculae, and the relatively small amount of splenic parenchyma devoted to white pulp. The storage capacity in dogs and horses is remarkable: It has been claimed that the canine spleen can store one-third of the dog's erythrocytes while the animal sleeps and the equine spleen holds one-half of the animal's circulating red cell mass (which is considered advantageous because it reduces the viscosity of the circulating blood). Storage spleens expand and contract quickly under the influence of the autonomic nervous system, via sympathetic and vagal fibers in the trabeculae and reticular walls of the red pulp vascular spaces and other circulatory disruptions, such as hypovolemic and/or cardiogenic shock. Thus storage spleens may be either grossly enlarged and congested or small with a wrinkled surface and a dry parenchyma depending on whether the spleen is congested from stored blood or shrunken from contraction (see Uniform Splenomegaly and Small Spleens).",

Studies have indicated that splenic EMH in dogs and cats most commonly occurs with degenerative or inflammatory conditions (e.g., hematomas, thrombosis) and may occur without concomitant hematologic disease (see Uniform Splenomegaly with a Firm Consistency). It is also found in splenic nodular hyperplasia (see Splenic Nodules with a Firm Consistency). In some species, such as the mouse, EMH is a normal function of the adult spleen and not necessarily a response to disease or hypoxic challenge.

In animals with storage spleens, the distention of the red pulp from stored blood separates the foci of white pulp (PALS and lymphoid follicles), making white pulp appear sparser. Splenic white pulp is organized around central arteries in the form of PALS, which are populated primarily by T lymphocytes (see Figure 13-38, Figure 13-39, Figure 13-40). Primary splenic follicles are located eccentrically in PALS and are primarily composed of B lymphocytes. When exposed to antigen, the splenic lymphoid follicles develop germinal centers (see Lymphoid/Lymphatic System, Lymph Nodes, Function). Macrophages in the white pulp follicles remove apoptotic B lymphocytes not selected for expansion because of low binding affinity for antigen. Failure of these macrophages to phagocytize has been experimentally correlated with decreased production of growth factors like TGF-\u03b2 and increased production of inflammatory cytokines that predispose the animal to autoimmune conditions.",

Marginal zone macrophages are divided into two types based on their location and the type of cell surface receptors they possess. The first group is positioned toward the periphery of the marginal zone, whereas the second group, the marginal metallophilic macrophages (so called for their silver staining positivity), is at the inner margin of the marginal zone closer to the splenic follicle and PALS. It has been difficult to generate mammalian models that eliminate one of the two classes of marginal zone macrophages, so the degree to which one group specializes in a particular function is not clear. Some marginal zone macrophages actively phagocytize particulate matter or bacteria (e.g., septicemias caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, or Bacillus anthracis) in the blood (see Fig. 13-40). They also play a similar role in limiting the spread of viral infections. Other marginal zone macrophages phagocytize and process antigens. Thus macrophages of the marginal zone serve to bridge the innate and adaptive immune responses by secreting inflammatory cytokines to activate other immune cells and providing receptor-based activation of marginal zone lymphocytes. Studies have shown that a loss of marginal zone macrophages coincides with decreased antigen trapping by resident B lymphocytes of the marginal zone and consequently a decrease in the early IgM response to antigens.",

In dogs, blood flow and transit time depend on whether the spleen is contracted or distended; blood flow is slower in the distended spleen. The extent to which macrophages of the monocyte-macrophage system phagocytize particles depends to a large degree on the sequence in which they receive blood. In most species, macrophages of the marginal sinus are the first to receive blood, and consequently phagocytized particles and bacteria tend to be more concentrated here initially.

The blood of dogs injected with 1 billion pneumococci per pound of body weight into the splenic artery was cleared of all bacteria in 65 minutes.

If the number of pathogenic bacteria in the circulation exceeds the capacity of the splenic macrophages, as in cases of severe septicemia, it may result in acute splenic congestion (see Uniform Splenomegaly with a Bloody Consistency). This may be followed by inflammation with areas of necrosis, fibrin deposition, and infiltration by neutrophils in bacteremias of pyogenic bacteria. The marginal zone can be the initial site of response to blood-borne antigens and bacteria delivered by the radial branches of the central arteries to the marginal sinus. Similar to the response of the red pulp vascular spaces, the marginal zone can become congested and with time (only hours with highly pathogenic organisms) may contain aggregates of neutrophils and macrophages.

The cells of the dark zone, called centroblasts, are large, densely packed lymphocytes with scant cytoplasm, giving this area a darker appearance on H&E staining. The centroblasts undergo somatic mutations of the variable regions of the immunoglobulin gene, followed by isotype class switching (from IgM to IgG or IgA). During this process most centroblasts undergo apoptosis, and cell fragments are phagocytized by macrophages, which are then termed tingible (stainable) body macrophages. The cells that have survived the affinity maturation process are now called centrocytes and along with T lymphocytes and follicular DCs, populate the germinal center light zone. These post\u2013germinal center B lymphocytes leave the follicle as plasma cell precursors (immunoblasts or plasmablasts) and migrate from the cortex to the medullary cords, where they mature and excrete antibody into the efferent lymph. Some of these cells may colonize the region surrounding the mantle cell zone to form a marginal zone. Marginal zones are apparent only in situations of prolonged and intense immune stimulation and serve as a reservoir of memory cells.

Depending on the duration and continued exposure to the antigen, there may also be concomitant paracortical hyperplasia and medullary cord plasmacytosis. Less florid follicular reactions will have smaller separated germinal centers, whereas nodes receiving persistent high levels of antigen stimulation may have coalescing germinal centers (termed \u201catypical benign follicular hyperplasia\u201d). In such cases of chronic strong antigenemia, the highly reactive nodes may also exhibit colonization of lymphocytes into perinodal fat, and germinal centers may contain irregular lakes of eosinophilic material, known as follicular hyalinosis. As the immune response declines, there is follicular lymphoid depletion and the concentration of lymphocytes in the germinal centers is reduced, allowing the underlying follicular stroma (including DCs and macrophages) to become visible. With ongoing lymphocyte depletion, the mantle cell zones are thinned, less populated, and discontinuous. Eventually, residual mantle cells collapse into the follicular stroma, forming clusters of small dark cells within the bed of DCs and macrophages, referred to as fading follicles.",

Purine analogues (e.g., azathioprine) compete with purines in the synthesis of nucleic acids, whereas alkylating agents like cyclophosphamide cross-link DNA and inhibit the replication and activation of lymphocytes. Cyclosporin A specifically inhibits the T lymphocyte signaling pathway by interfering with the transcription of the IL-2 gene. Methotrexate, a folic acid antagonist, blocks the synthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. The immunosuppressive effects of some of these agents is desirable for the treatment of immune-mediated disease (e.g., immune-mediated hemolytic anemia) or to prevent allograft rejection after transplantation. Corticosteroids may be given at an immunosuppressive dose, though the degree of suppression is highly variable among species. Local or palliative treatment of cancer may include radiotherapy (ionizing radiation) to target and damage the DNA of the neoplastic cells. Although some immunosuppression may be noted, particularly if bone marrow or lymphoid tissue is within the therapeutically irradiated field, mounting evidence suggests that radiotherapy can induce a cascade of proimmunogenic effects that engage the innate and adaptive immune systems to contribute to the destruction of tumor cells.",

For example, equine infectious anemia has cyclical periods of viremia, with immune-mediated damage to erythrocytes and platelets, and phagocytosis to remove altered erythrocytes and platelets. These cycles result in proliferation of red pulp macrophages, hyperplasia of hematopoietic cells (EMH) to replace those lost, and hyperplasia of lymphocytes in the white pulp.",

The formation of single or multiple lineages of hematopoietic cells is often observed in many tissues and commonly in the spleen. The ability of blood cell precursors to home, proliferate, and mature in extramedullary sites relies on the presence of HSCs and pathophysiologic changes in the microenvironment (i.e., extracellular matrix, stroma, and chemokines). In the spleen, HSCs have been found within vessels and adjacent to endothelial cells to form a vascular niche; thus splenic EMH occurs in the red pulp, both within the red pulp vascular spaces and sinusoids (of the dog). The predilection for EMH to occur varies among species (for instance, splenic EMH persists throughout adulthood in mice), and the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood, but four major theories to explain the causes of EMH are (1) severe bone marrow failure; (2) myelostimulation; (3) tissue inflammation, injury, and repair; and (4) abnormal chemokine production.",

Storage diseases typically occur in animals less than 1 year of age. In general, these substrates are lipids and/or carbohydrates that accumulate in the cells, the result of the lack of normal processing within lysosomes. Major categories of stored materials include mucopolysaccharides, sphingolipids, glycolipids, glycoproteins, glycogen, and oligosaccharides.

In acute cases of splenic capsular rupture, the spleen is contracted and dry and the surface wrinkled from the marked blood loss (Fig. 13-73\n). In more severe cases the spleen may be broken into two or more pieces, and small pieces of splenic parenchyma may be scattered throughout the omentum and peritoneum (sometimes called splenosis) (Fig. 13-74, A\n). Clotted blood, fibrin, and omentum may adhere to the surface at the rupture site. If the rupture is not fatal, the spleen heals by fibrosis, and there may be a capsular scar. Occasionally there are two or more separate pieces of spleen adjacent to each other and sometimes joined by scar tissue in the gastrosplenic ligament.

Members of M. avium complex cause similar lesions and have been described in a number of species, including dogs, cats, primates, pigs, cattle, sheep, horses, and human beings. Infection may begin by inhalation of aerosol droplets containing the bacilli, which may spread via the lymphatic vessels to regional lymph nodes, resulting in granulomatous lymphangitis and lymphadenitis (Fig. 13-81\n). Initially lesions in the lymphatic system are confined to the lymphatic vessels (granulomatous lymphangitis) and regional lymph nodes (e.g., the tracheobronchial lymph nodes in the case of pulmonary tuberculosis), but once disseminated in the lymph or blood, lymph nodes throughout the body will have lesions. Well-organized granulomas consist of a central mass of macrophages with phagocytized mycobacteria, surrounded by epithelioid and foamy macrophages and occasional multinucleated giant cells (Langhans type). These inflammatory nodules are surrounded by a layer of lymphocytes enclosed in a fibrous capsule. Over time the center of the granuloma may undergo caseous necrosis due to the high lipid and protein content of the dead macrophages (see Chapter 3). In bovine Johne's disease the mesenteric lymph nodes draining the infected intestine can have noncaseous granulomas (Fig. 13-82\n).",

This enzyme is required for receptor gene rearrangements involved in the maturation of lymphocytes, and the resulting loss of functional T and B lymphocytes leads to a profound susceptibility to infectious diseases. Though normal at birth, these foals develop diarrhea and pneumonia by approximately 10 days of age, often due to adenovirus, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Pneumocystis carinii infections. Affected foals often die before 5 months of age. Lymph nodes and thymus are small and often grossly undetectable, and the spleen is small and firm due to the absence of white pulp (see Fig. 13-70). The development of genetic tests to identify carriers of the disorder has led to a decrease in the prevalence of severe combined immunodeficiency disease. Recently, severe combined immunodeficiency disease was diagnosed in a single Caspian filly, though the exact genetic defect was not determined. Congenital immunodeficiency diseases are also discussed in detail in Chapter 5.",

There is a higher prevalence in dairy cattle compared to beef breeds. BLV is transmitted horizontally (e.g., blood, milk/colostrum, saliva) or iatrogenically (e.g., rectal sleeves, instruments/equipment). Following infection, BLV invades and integrates into the genome of infected B lymphocytes, resulting in a polyclonal B lymphocyte lymphocytosis in approximately 30% of cattle. In approximately 1% to 5% of BLV-infected cattle, a single clone will emerge, leading to the development of B lymphocyte leukemia/lymphoma. The average incubation period between infection and development of lymphoma is 7 to 8 years, and this low conversion rate suggests that the latency period may be longer than the life span of most animals (dairy cattle seldom live to the 7- to 8-year peak incidence of lymphoma occurrence). Other contributing variables, such as genetic background, coinfections, and environmental factors, may also play a role in lymphomagenesis. The exact mechanism of BLV-induced tumorigenesis is poorly understood. Recently BLV microRNAs (miRNAs) were identified in preleukemic and malignant B lymphocytes, which showed repression of structural and regulatory gene expression.

Affected pigs are typically less than 1 year of age, and there is no reported breed predisposition, although a hereditary basis is suspected in cases arising in inbred herds. The two main forms of porcine lymphoma are thymic/mediastinal and multicentric; the latter is more common. Spleen, liver, kidney, bone marrow, and lymph nodes are affected in the multicentric form, with visceral lymph nodes reportedly more commonly involved than peripheral nodes. A recent study of lymphoma in 17 pigs found the majority to be multicentric, and subtypes included the following: B lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, diffuse and intestinal large B cell lymphoma, and peripheral T cell lymphoma. One case each of thymic B cell and T cell lymphomas were also described.",

A mutation in DNA-PKcs (similar to Arabian horses) with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance is seen in Jack Russell terriers. An X-linked form of severe combined immunodeficiency disease is well described in basset hounds and is caused by mutations in the common \u03b3-chain (\u03b3c) subunit of the receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21. A similar disease is seen in Cardigan Welsh corgi puppies, though it is an autosomal mode of inheritance in this breed. The mutation inhibits the signal transduction pathways initiated by any of these cytokines, which are critical for the proliferation, differentiation, survival, and function of B and T lymphocytes. Affected dogs have normal numbers of circulating B lymphocytes that are unable to class switch to IgG or IgA and reduced numbers of T lymphocytes, which are nonfunctional due to the inability to express IL receptors. Affected puppies are remarkably susceptible to bacterial and viral infections and rarely survive past 3 to 4 months of age. The thymus of these dogs is small and consists of only small dysplastic lobules with a few of Hassall's corpuscles. Tonsils, lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches are often grossly unidentifiable due to the severe lymphocyte hypoplasia. Congenital immunodeficiency diseases are also discussed in detail in Chapter 5.",

FeLV infects T lymphocytes and can cause myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemias (see Myeloid Neoplasia), and T lymphocyte leukemia/lymphoma. In the latter the mediastinum (thymus, mediastinal, and sternal lymph nodes) is the site most commonly involved, although a multicentric distribution also occurs.

This form is also the most common subtype in human immunodeficiency virus and posttransplantation patients caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Therefore it is reasonable to question whether these two groups of immunosuppressed cats may be more prone to infection by a gammaherpesvirus similar to EBV, leading to lymphoma.

The earliest lineage commitment is to either the common myeloid progenitor (CMP), which produces platelets, erythrocytes, and nonlymphoid leukocytes, or the common lymphoid progenitor (CLP), which differentiates into various lymphocytes and plasma cells. The cell origin of mast cells is unclear, but they may originate from a stem cell or a myeloid progenitor. Megakaryocytes remain in the bone marrow and release cytoplasmic fragments, or platelets, into blood sinusoids. T lymphocyte progenitor (TLP) cells travel from the bone marrow to the thymus during normal T lymphocyte maturation. During homeostasis, platelets and erythrocytes remain in circulation, but the leukocytes leave blood vessels to enter the tissues, where they actively participate in immune responses. In particular, monocytes and B lymphocytes undergo morphologic and immunologic changes to form macrophages and plasma cells, respectively.

The liver clears haptoglobin-hemoglobin and hemopexin-methemoglobin complexes from plasma and converts hemoglobin to unconjugated bilirubin and then conjugated bilirubin. Conjugated bilirubin is normally excreted in the bile and then converted to urobilinogen (yellow) and subsequently stercobilinogen (dark brown). However, excessive bilirubin will spill over into the plasma, resulting in hyperbilirubinemia, icteric plasma (if severe enough), and urinary excretion of bilirubin (bilirubinuria; icteric urine).
