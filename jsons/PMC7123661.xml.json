Some reports of a similar drug (but in the zymogen form) are interesting, but high-quality evidence is still missing [11, 12]. Hospital-acquired infections have increased and account for 4.5% of admissions [13]. An alarming scarcity of new antibiotic classes in the pipelines of the pharmaceutical industry reduces availability of new molecules and has forced the healthcare community to optimize the therapeutic potential of currently available antibiotics [14], but pan-drug-resistant bacteria are reported.",

            "text": "Etiology of sepsis is classically approached by considering the site of infection and the microbiological responsible pathogen.\nThe lungs represent the most common site of infection and pneumonia is associated with the highest mortality. According to Table 2, showing some of the most important (published after 2012 on journal with impact factor superior to 6, including at least 100 randomized patients) recent randomized studies on several sepsis treatments, the lungs were the site of infection for 41[15]\u201384 % [16] of enrolled patients. Secondarily, genitourinary tract, especially in young women, and intra-abdominal sepsis in surgical cohorts, account for, respectively, 1\u201321 % [7, 17] and 7\u201338 % [15, 16] of cases.\nBloodstream infections are expected to increase due to the higher number of implantable devices utilized, such as pacemakers and long-lasting central or peripheral inserted venous catheters. In some series, these could be responsible for up to 14 % of etiology of sepsis [10].Knowing the site of infection is very important. Even though severe sepsis and septic shock are syndromes involving the whole body, the identification of the specific site of infection causes important subsequent actions.First, it has been proved that the choice of the correct antibiotic molecule must consider its penetration and activity in the site of infection. It is well known, for example, that important molecules against severe pathogens like MRSA (methicillin-resistant\nStaphylococcus aureus), such as daptomycin, are very effective against the bloodstream infection but completely useless in lung disease, due to surfactant inactivation.Second, the site of infection is associated with the risk of death. Urinary tract and intravascular catheter infections are less likely to be lethal than sepsis involving the lungs, abdomen, or soft tissues.Third, some sites of infection will require adjunctive therapies other than antibiotics to obtain infection control. Drainage of abscess, revision of anastomosis, and debridement of tissue necrosis are sometimes fundamental to obtain source control in sepsis. Galeno\u2019s adage ubi pus ibi evacua (where there is pus, there evacuate it), from 150 b.C. is still very valid (nowadays probably not with extensive surgery, but with more accurate and conservative radiological guided procedures, as a percutaneous drainage of an abscess).Many important data on the causative pathogens come from EPIC II study, an international collaborative study that enrolled 1,265 intensive care units (ICUs) all around the world in 2007 [18]. This study confirmed the respiratory tract to be the first site of infection but extensively evaluated causative microorganisms.Among pathogens, gram negative account for majority of isolates (62 %), with Escherichia coli in the prominent position (16 %). Gram positive account for 47 %, with Staphylococcus aureus (SA) in the first line (21 %).\nPseudomonas species and fungi are important pathogens in sepsis nowadays (respectively, 20 % and 19 %).According to Table 2, it is important to notice that, even in highly controlled settings, the probability of missing the causative agent of sepsis is still too high: up to 41 % [9]. Missing pathogen identification could have important outcome on choice, tailoring, and escalation of antibiotic treatment. It is well known that missing efficacy of first-line antibiotics has a severe and important impact on patients\u2019 outcome [19].Pathogen identification can also help to stratify patients\u2019 risk of death and advise on appropriate setting for treatment (ICU versus general ward) and intensity of clinical and laboratory monitoring.Cohen and colleagues [20] reviewed half a thousand papers, including more than 55,000 patients with microbiologically confirmed infections. Analyzing in detail the interaction between the site of infection and the causative pathogen, they showed that SA involved in skin and soft tissue infections causes death in 0\u201325 % of patients, while the same pathogen in the lung causes death in 31\u201384 % of patients.Therefore, the site of infection and the identification of the pathogen involved are both of paramount importance and strongly interrelated and should be considered together when approaching the evaluation or treatment of patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.\n",
