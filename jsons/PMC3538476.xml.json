RNA was extracted by the MagNA Pure 2.0 instrument (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN), and then influenza A and B RNA was detected using the multiplex rRT-PCR Prodesse ProFlu+ assay (Gen-Probe, San Diego, CA). The assay was modified for use on the LightCycler 480 (Roche Applied Science). A positive result is produced by this assay when amplification of viral RNA generates a fluorescent signal above the instrument detection threshold. The number of rRT-PCR cycles at which the signal crosses the threshold is known as the crossing point (Cp), which is inversely correlated to the logarithm of the initial copy number; higher Cps correlate with lower levels of viral RNA. Discordant results were resolved using previously described laboratory-developed influenza A and B rRT-PCR assays.15",

Further, they demonstrated that direct involvement of parents in the collection process increased the child's acceptance of the midturbinate nasal flocked swab.

Unlike traditional swabs that are constructed by wrapping absorbent rayon fibers around a sturdy applicator, flocked swabs have no internal mattress core to entrap the sample. As a result, the entire sample stays close to the surface and elutes quickly and completely into testing media. Both swabs have a similar diameter. Recent studies have indicated that midturbinate nasal flocked swabs have high sensitivity and specificity for detection of common respiratory viruses by direct immunofluorescent antibody and molecular assays compared with nasopharyngeal swabs, while only being inserted to half the depth.14,16-18 Thus, the midturbinate nasal flocked swabs provide a less invasive yet sensitive alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs and are more amenable to patient self-collection. The swabs used in this study have a safety collar to indicate the depth of insertion and are also available in a pediatric version for children aged 2 years or younger.",

First, the study had a relatively small number of patients with influenza B infection compared with those with influenza A, although it is unlikely that the method of collection would have any influence on detection of influenza by type. Second, most study participants were white, and hence, the results may not be generalizable to broader populations with disparate socioeconomic, educational, and racial backgrounds. Third, since midturbinate nasal flocked swabs were employed in this study, extrapolation of results to commercially available molecular systems that require use of nasopharyngeal swabs may require further validation studies. Finally, low level of virus in specimens can result in discrepant results between HCW and self-collection methods, as observed in this study.",

First, the patient-collection strategy may reduce time spent in the outpatient clinic or emergency department (ED) and thus reduce influenza exposure risks to other vulnerable patients and HCWs. We view this as a considerable advantage because outpatient clinic and ED waiting rooms often collectively group immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients together, and waiting times are commonly prolonged. Patient protection is a priority, and minimizing unintentional exposures to influenza virus is a primary objective of this testing approach. Second, self-collection may provide a more time-efficient testing approach, which could lead to an earlier diagnosis of influenza infection and initiation of time-sensitive antiviral treatment. Third, this strategy could decrease the burden on busy outpatient clinics and EDs during peak influenza season if combined with a triage method to determine which patients should be tested and if self-collection is an appropriate strategy. Finally, patient collection may be useful for large epidemiological or vaccine efficacy studies in which patient or parent collection may ensure better compliance. Of note, this method potentially could be used for detection of other respiratory viruses in addition to influenza A and B, such as respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, and coronavirus. This should be examined further using laboratory-developed or commercially available individual and multiplex molecular respiratory platforms.",

Five potential participants were not comfortable obtaining a midturbinate nasal flocked swab themselves and opted not to participate in the study for this reason. Therefore, self-collection programs may wish to provide an alternative mechanism for HCW collection when necessary. It is also important to note that some patients may encounter difficulties in reading or interpreting written instructions or opening the swab packaging. Consideration should be given to providing instructions in multiple languages and providing easy-to-open packaging. Picture-based instructions may be created for a wider variety of patients, including illiterate patients, patients with limited reading skills, children, and those for whom English is not the first language. Further, pictures may improve adherence to instructions by avoiding misinterpretations of written instructions even among literate patients.",

Patients could first be screened over the phone by a trained HCW using a standardized triage questionnaire to determine whether self-collection is appropriate for that particular patient according to an assessment of risk factors and disease severity. If treatment decisions will not be influenced by the test result, then testing may not be indicated. If the patient is eligible for self-collection, then the patient or a caregiver would be offered the option of obtaining a swab kit with instructions from an easy access point such as a community-based clinic, pharmacy, drive-through facility, or even a specialized vending machine. If patients are not comfortable obtaining their own specimen, then they may be offered an office visit. After self-collection, the patient or caregiver would drop the swab off at a convenient location designed to maximize testing turnaround time. After testing is performed, the laboratory result could be communicated to the patient or a health care provider (primary care physician, nurse practitioner or physician assistant) who could offer further instruction and decide whether treatment is appropriate. At our institution, a prescription for oseltamivir may be generated by a health care provider and sent to the laboratory along with the patient's swab specimen.15 If the test result is positive for influenza, then the laboratory will fax the prescription to the patient's pharmacy. If the test result is negative, then the prescription is not faxed. This serves to link the prescription to the positive test result and avoid unnecessary drug use. The patients obtain their test results by calling a registered phone number and providing their unique patient identification number. The automated phone service informs the patient when a prescription has been sent to the pharmacy on the basis of a positive laboratory result. It is easy to envision how this system could be further modified to suit the needs of the clinical practice and the patients it serves. This same approach has been used for many years at our institution for detection of group A streptococci in patients suspected to have streptococcal pharyngitis.19",

At our institution, a visit to the ED for an uncomplicated ILI costs the health care system approximately 1.8 times more than an outpatient office visit, which in turn costs 4 times more than a visit to an express care clinic. In comparison, the salary and indirect costs incurred during a 10-minute telephone call with a registered nurse cost the health care system 5 times less than a visit to an express care clinic. Therefore, the cost incurred to the health care system is significantly reduced when the nurse-triage model is used. One would expect that the charge to the patient would be similarly decreased.",
