During the first few months of the pandemic, over 4,500 new Wikipedia pages on COVID-19 have been created and have accumulated close to 250M pageviews by early April 2020. 1 At the same time, an unprecedented amount of scientific articles on COVID-19 and the ongoing pandemic have been published online. Wikipedia's contents are based on reliable sources, primarily scientific literature. Given its public function, it is crucial for Wikipedia to rely on representative and reliable scientific results, especially so in a time of crisis. We assess the coverage of COVID-19-related research in Wikipedia via citations. We find that Wikipedia editors are integrating new research at an unprecedented fast pace. While doing so, they are able to provide a largely representative coverage of COVID-19related research. We show that all the main topics discussed in this literature are proportionally represented from Wikipedia, after accounting for article-level effects. We further use regression analyses to model citations from Wikipedia and show that, despite the pressure to keep up with novel results, Wikipedia editors rely on literature which is highly cited, widely shared on social media, and has been peer-reviewed.",

Wikipedia is particularly important as go-point to access trusted medical information [53, 51] . Fortunately, Wikipedia biomedical articles have been repeatedly found to be highly visible and of high quality [5, 31] . Wikipedia's verifiability policy mandates that readers can check the sources of information contained in Wikipedia, and that reliable sources should be secondary and published. 2 These guidelines are particularly strict with respect to biomedical contents, where the preferred sources are, in order: systematic reviews, reviews, books and other scientific literature. 3 The COVID-19 pandemic has put Wikipedia under stress with a large amount of new, often non-peer-reviewed research being published in parallel to a surge in interest for information related to the pandemic [16] . The response of Wikipedia's editor community has been fast: since March 17 2020, all COVID-19-related Wikipedia pages have been put under indefinite sanctions entailing restricted edit access, to allow for a better vetting of their contents. 4 In parallel, a WikiProject COVID-19 has been established and a content creation campaign is ongoing [16, 22] . 5 While this effort is commendable, it also raises questions on the capacity of editors to find, select and integrate scientific information on COVID-19 at such a rapid pace, while keeping quality high. In Figure 1 we show the time in number of months from publication to a first citation from Wikipedia for a large set of COVID-19-related articles (see Section 3). In 2020, this time has become negative on average: articles on COVID-19 are frequently cited in Wikipedia even before their official publication date, based on early access versions of articles.",

The second question is instead approached using regression analysis. In particular, we model whether an article is cited from Wikipedia or not, and how many citations it receives from Wikipedia. We then again compare results for articles cited before and during the pandemic, and with previous art. Our main finding is that Wikipedia contents rely on representative and high-impact COVID-19-related research. (RQ1) During the past few months, Wikipedia editors have successfully integrated COVID-19 and coronavirus research, keeping apace with the rapid growth of related literature by including (a representative sample of) it. (RQ2) The inclusion criteria used by Wikipedia editors to integrate COVID-19-related research during the pandemic are consistent with those from before, and appear reasonable in terms of source reliability. Specifically, editors prefer articles from specialized journals over mega journals or pre-prints, and focus on highly cited and/or highly socially visible literature. Some altmetrics such as Twitter shares, mentions in news and blogs, Mendeley readers are complementing citation counts from the scientific literature as an indicator of impact positively correlated with citations from Wikipedia. After controlling for these article-level impact indicators, and for publication venue, time and size-effects, there is no indication that the topic of research matters with respect to receiving citations from Wikipedia, signaling that Wikipedia is currently not over nor under-relying on any specific COVID-19-related scientific topic.",

Both methods made use of the titles and abstracts of available publications, by concatenating them into a single string. We detected 66,915 articles in English, out of 69,969 total articles (-3054 over total). Of these, 13,852 have no abstract, thus we only used their title. Before performing topic modelling, we applied a pre-processing pipeline using scispaCy's en core sci md model [36] to convert each document into a bag-of-words representation, which includes the following steps: entity detection and inclusion in the bag-of-words for entities strictly longer than one token; lemmatisation; removal of (isolated) punctuation, stopwords and tokens composed of a single character; inclusion of frequent bigrams. SPECTER embeddings were instead retrieved from the API without any pre-processing. 7 We then trained and compared topic models using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [8], Correlated Topic Models (CTM) [7], Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) [54] and a range of topics between 5 and 50. We found similar results in terms of topic contents and in terms of their Wikipedia coverage (see Section 4) across models and over multiple runs, and a reasonable value of the number of topics to be between 15 and 25 from a topic coherence analysis [35] . Therefore, in what follows we discuss an LDA model with 15 topics. 8 The top words for each topic of this model are given in the SI, while topic intensities over time are plotted as a heat map in Figure 9 .",

From Figure 3a , we can appreciate the surge in new citations added from Wikipedia to COVID-19 research. Importantly, these citations were not only added to cope with the growing amount of new literature, but also to fill gaps by including literature published before 2020, as shown in Figure 8b . The total fraction of COVID-19-related articles that are cited at least once from Wikipedia over the total is 3.1%. Yet, this number is uneven over languages and over time. Articles in English have a 3.2% chance of being cited from Wikipedia, while articles in other languages only a 0.036% chance. To be sure, the whole corpus is English dominated, as we discussed above. This might be an artefact of the coverage of the data sources, as well as the way the corpus was assembled. The coverage of articles over time is instead given in Figure 4 , starting from 2003 when the first surge of publications happens due to SARS. We can appreciate that the coverage seems to be uneven, and less pronounced for the past few years (2017-2020), yet this needs to be considered in view of the high growth of publications in 2020. Hence, while 2020 is a relatively lowcoverage year (2.2%), it is already the year with the most publications cited from Wikipedia in absolute number (Figure 8b ). Citation distributions are skewed in Wikipedia as they are in science more generally. Some articles receive a high number of citations from Wikipedia and some Wikipedia articles make a high number of citations to COVID-19-related literature. Table 1 Table 2 reports instead the top 20 journal articles cited from Wikipedia. These also follow a similar pattern: articles published before 2020 focus on virology and are made of a high proportion of review articles. The top cited article, for example, deals with virus taxonomy. Articles published in 2020, instead, have a focus on the ongoing pandemic, its origins, as well as its epidemiological and public health aspects. As we see next, this strongly aligns with the general trends of COVID-19-related research over time.",

The COVID-19 research corpus is dominated by literature on coronaviruses, public health and epidemics, largely due to 2020 publications. COVID-19-related research did not accumulate uniformly over time. We plot the relative (yearly mean, Figure 10a ) and absolute (yearly sum, Figure 10b ) macrotopic intensity. From these plots, we confirm the periodisation of COVID-19-related research as connected to known outbreaks. Outbreaks generate a shift in the attention of the research community, which is apparent when we consider the relative macrotopic intensity over time in Figure 10a . The 2003 SARS outbreak generated a shift associated with a raise of publications on coronaviruses and on the management of epidemic outbreaks (public health, epidemiology). Stable macrotopics instead include molecular biology, viral transmission, immunology and clinical medicine. A similar shift is again happening, at a much larger scale, during the current COVID-19 pandemic. When we consider the absolute macrotopic intensity, which can be interpreted as the number of articles on a given topic (Figure 10b ), we can appreciate how scientists are mostly focusing on topics related to public health, epidemics and coronaviruses (COVID-19) during these first months of the current pandemic.",

In Figure 5 , three plots are provided: the macrotopic intensity of articles published before 2020 (Figure 5a ), in 2020 ( Figure 5b ) and overall ( Figure 5c ). The macrotopic intensity is averaged and 95% confidence intervals are provided. From Figure 5c we can see that Wikipedia seems to cover COVID-19-related research well. The macrotopics on immunology, molecular biology and transmission seem slightly over represented, where clinical medicine, coronaviruses, public health and epidemics are slightly under represented. A comparison between publications from 2020 and from before highlights further trends. In particular, in 2020 Wikipedia editors have focused more on recent literature on coronaviruses, thus directly related to COVID-19 and the current pandemic, and proportionally less on literature on public health and epidemics, which is also dominating 2020 publications. The traditional slight over representation of immunology and viral transmission literature persists. Detailed Kruskal-Wallis H test statistics and Cohen's d effect sizes are provided in the SI ( Figure 13 and Tables 3, 4, 5). While distributions are significantly different for most macrotopics and periodisations, the effect sizes are always small or very small. The coverage of COVID-19-related literature from Wikipedia appears therefore to be reasonably balanced from this first analysis, and to remain so in 2020. The topical differences we found, especially around coronaviruses and the current COVID-19 outbreak, might in part be explained by the criterion of notability which led to the creation or expansion of Wikipedia articles on the ongoing pandemic. 9 A complementary way to address the same research question is to investigate Wikipedia's coverage of publication clusters. We consider here both SPECTER k-means clusters and bibliographic network clusters. While we use all 20 SPECTER clusters, we limit ourselves to the top-n network clusters which are necessary in order to cover at least 50% of the nodes in the network. In this way, we consider 13 clusters for the citation network, all of size above 800. In Figure 6 we plot the % of articles cited from Wikipedia per cluster, and the clusters size in number of publications they contain. There is a general size effect, more pronounced for the SPECTRE clustering (Figure 6a ), by which larger clusters are more represented than smaller clusters. When considering the citation network clustering solution, this applies to the two largest clusters, but not to the rest (Figure 6b ).",

The least cited clusters include number 18 (containing pre-prints from Research Square) and 5 (focused on the social sciences, and especially economics, e.g., from SSRN journals). Considering citation network clusters, the largest and most cited are number 0 (containing research on all coronaviruses from a variety of perspectives with a good balance among macrotopics) and 1 (with publications exclusively from 2020 on the current pandemic). The other clusters are smaller and hence more specialized. For example, at the two extremes we have cluster 11 (highly cited, mainly containing literature on viral infectious diseases) and cluster 10 (lowly cited, focused on animal to human transmission and immunology).

Yet, we also find that, in particular with citation network clusters, smaller clusters can be either highly or lowly cited from Wikipedia on average. Lastly, we find an under representation of pre-print and social science research using text-based clustering, which we cannot find using citation network clustering.

This seems largely due to publication size-effects, since the fraction of 2020 articles cited from Wikipedia is quite low (see Figure 4 . . In the 2020 model, these less-cited-from-Wikipedia venues include pre-print servers (medRxiv in particular), mega-journals (PLoS One) and social sciences (SSRN). Positive correlations occur for few other specialized venues, such as Antiviral Research, The Lancet and Virology. When we consider indicators of impact, we see a significant positive effect for citation counts, Mendeley readers, Twitter, news and blogs mentions; we see instead no effect for policy document mentions and Facebook engagements. This is consistent in the 2019 model, except for smaller effects on citation counts and higher effects of Mendeley readers. This result, on the one hand, highlights the importance of academic indicators of impact such as citations, and on the other hand suggests the possible complementarity of altmetrics in this respect. Since certain altmetrics can accumulate more rapidly than citations [14], they could complement them effectively when needed [26] . Furthermore, the expert ratio in altmetrics engagement is negatively correlated with being cited from Wikipedia in 2020. This might be due to the high altmetrics engagement with COVID-19 research in 2020, but it could also hint at the possibility that social media impact need not be driven by experts in order to be correlated with scientific impact. We can further see how cluster size-effects are positively correlated with being cited from Wikipedia in 2020, and especially so for SPECTER clusters, but not in 2019. Lastly, we can see that macrotopic intensities are never correlated with being cited from Wikipedia in either model, underlining that Wikipedia appears to be proportionally representing all COVID-19-related research and that residual topical differences in coverage are due to article-level effects.",

For binary discrete variables (0/1), they represent the discrete rate of change in the probability of the outcome, everything else kept fix; therefore, a change from 0 to 1 with a significant coefficient of 0.01 entails an increase in the probability of the outcome of 1%. For categorical variables with more than two outcomes, they represent the difference in the predicted probabilities of any one category relative to the reference category. For continuous variables, they represent the instantaneous rate of change. It might be the case that this can also be interpreted linearly (e.g., a significant change of 1 in the variable entails a change proportional to the marginal effect coefficient in the probability of the outcome).

A second limitation is that this study is based on citations from Wikipedia to scientific publications, and no Wikipedia content analysis is performed. Citations to scientific literature, while informative, do not completely address the interrelated questions of Wikipedia's knowledge representativeness and reliability. Therefore, some directions for future work include comparing Wikipedia coverage with expert COVID-19 review articles, as well as studying Wikipedia edit and discussion history in order to assess editor motivations. Another interesting direction for future work is the assessment of all Wikipedia citations to any source from COVID-19 Wikipedia pages, since here we only focused on the fraction directed at COVID-19-related scientific articles. Lastly, future work can address the engagement of Wikipedia users with cited COVID-19-related sources.",
