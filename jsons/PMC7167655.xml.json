            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), an emerging infectious disease with significant morbidity and mortality, is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) which mainly infects lung and bronchial tissues, leading to acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. In vitro studies have shown that angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the functional receptor for SARS\u2010CoV 6, 7, 8, 9. Human 293T or murine 3T3 cells transfected with human ACE2, but not those transfected with HIV\u20101 receptors (CD4 and CCR5), permit SARS\u2010CoV entry. The soluble and cell\u2010associated ACE2 can specifically bind to the receptor\u2010binding domain (RBD) in the spike (S) protein of SARS\u2010CoV 6, 7, 8, 9. Most recently, Kuba et al demonstrated that ACE2\u2010knockout mice become unsusceptible to SARS\u2010CoV challenge, providing the first genetic proof that ACE2 plays a critical role in SARS\u2010CoV infection in vivo in animals 10. However, it is unclear whether ACE2\u2010expressing cells in humans can be infected in vivo by SARS\u2010CoV. The mechanisms of ALI and the pathogenesis of SARS have not been well defined.",

However, it is unclear whether these SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected cells express ACE2, the functional receptor for SARS\u2010CoV demonstrated in the in vitro and animal in vivo studies 6, 7, 10. Using MAbs specific for the human ACE2 protein and the SARS\u2010CoV S protein by IHC, as previously described 15, we systematically analysed the expression of both ACE2 and SARS\u2010CoV S protein in the autopsy specimens that were randomly collected from the lungs and other organs of four patients who died of SARS and one control subject who died suddenly in a traffic accident. In the lung and bronchial tissues of the SARS patients and control subject, ACE2 protein was detected in the epithelial cells of alveoli, trachea/bronchi, and bronchial serous glands, and in the pneumocytes and monocytes/macrophages in alveolar cavities (Figure 1 and Table 1). The anti\u2010ACE2 MAb was also reactive with cells in other organs and tissues of the SARS patients and control subject, including gastric parietal cells, small intestinal epithelial cells, liver cells, myocardial cells, distal convoluted renal tubular cells, adrenal cortical cells, pancreatic islet cells, sweat gland epithelial cells, and acidophilic cells of the pituitary (Figure 2 and Table 1). Interestingly, all of the ACE2\u2010expressing cells in the SARS patients were reactive with the MAb directed against the SARS\u2010CoV S protein (Figures 1 and 2 and Table 1). However, the anti\u2010S MAb did not react with the ACE2\u2212 cells (eg bronchial mucous gland epithelial cells, gastric chief cells, thyroid follicular epithelial cells) in the SARS patients, nor did it react with ACE2+ and ACE2\u2212 cells in the control subject (Figures 1 and 2 and Table 1). We also detected the RNAs encoding the human ACE2 protein and the SARS\u2010CoV S protein in the autopsy specimens using the ISH assay as previously described 15. The distribution of ACE2 and S RNAs detected by ISH in the autopsy tissues is fully consistent with that of ACE2 and S protein measured by IHC (see Supplementary Figure 1 at http://www.interscience.wiley.com/jpages/0022-3417/suppmat/path.2067.html).",

This was accomplished by IHC using MAbs against the PICs. As shown in Figure 3 and Table 1, most of the cells expressing both ACE2 and SARS\u2010CoV S protein were strongly reactive with the MAbs against MCP\u20101 and TGF\u2010\u03b21 and reacted significantly with the MAbs to TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2, and IL\u20106, respectively. However, these MAbs exhibited weak or no reactivity with the ACE2\u2212 cells in the SARS patients, and with the ACE2+ and ACE2\u2212 cells in the control subject. Similar results were obtained from the ISH assay for detecting the RNAs of MCP\u20101, TGF\u2010\u03b21, TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2, and IL\u20106 in the corresponding cells and tissues (see Supplementary Figure 2 at http://www.interscience.wiley.com/jpages/0022-3417/suppmat/path.2067.html).

SARS\u2010CoV may also infect and cause pathological changes in other organs, including the digestive tract, liver, kidneys, adrenal glands, heart, brain, etc 12, 15, 17. Here we further examined the pathological changes in the lungs of the SARS patients. All the SARS patients exhibited diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). The alveolar cavities were filled with desquamated epithelial cells (Figure 4A), some of which were clearly enlarged and contained multiple nuclei (Figure 4B). This suggests that these cells had undergone fusion to form syncytia, which is the cytopathic effect (CPE) caused by virus replication in cells 3, 12. T\u2010lymphocyte infiltrates as shown by CD45RO staining (Figure 4C), the formation of hyaline membranes resulting from fibrin deposition (Figure 4D), organization and fibrinosis of alveolar exudates (Figure 4D), and local infiltration of monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes in pulmonary interstitial tissues (Figure 4F) were observed. Obvious exudation of proliferative and/or activated monocytes/macrophages in alveoli (Figures 4G\u20134I) was revealed. There was significant apoptosis in epithelial cells, monocytes/macrophages, lymphocytes, and pneumocytes as revealed by Klenow\u2010FragEL staining (Figure 4J), and the detection of Fas (Figure 4K) and FasL (Figure 4L). These data suggest that the main histological changes, including infiltration of macrophages and desquamated epithelial cells, and significant apoptosis of epithelial cells and pneumocytes in the lungs, which may be the major causes of ALI, may be associated with up\u2010regulation of PICs in the SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected cells and the elevated levels of PICs in the blood of SARS patients.",

Microscopic examination of the SARS patients' lungs revealed significant infiltration and aggregation of macrophages in the alveolar cavities. Under stimulation by some PICs (eg TGF\u2010\u03b21 and TNF\u2010\u03b1, etc), macrophages become proliferative and/or activated 30, which in turn produces more PICs, leading to further immuno\u2010mediated damage of the tissues in the host 31.

Furthermore, no significant CPE in T lymphocytes has been observed in the autopsy tissues of SARS patients 12.

As discussed above, some of the PICs may enhance T\u2010lymphocyte apoptosis 32, 33, 34.

Unlike SARS\u2010CoV, HIV can directly infect and replicate in CD4+ T lymphocytes, resulting in rapid death of these cells 46. Even so, HIV infection does not cause acute disease. HIV\u2010infected individuals take several years to progress to AIDS and opportunistic infection is the main cause of death in patients with HIV/AIDS 47. Since the elevated levels of PICs may be the major mediators of the exaggerated immune responses that cause ALI and multi\u2010organ dysfunction in SARS patients, the use of immunosuppressive agents may effectively inhibit the production and function of PICs and reduce the severity of ALI. Corticosteroids were the treatment of choice of SARS during 2003\u20132004. However, several groups reported that early application of large doses of corticosteroids with Ribavirin, a non\u2010specific antiviral drug, for treating SARS patients did not show significant clinical benefits 48, 49 and even caused serious adverse effects, eg osteonecrosis 50 and aspergillosis 13, though the data were not obtained from well\u2010designed double\u2010blind, randomized, and placebo\u2010controlled clinical trials. One concern is that corticosteroids may non\u2010specifically suppress the function of most immuno\u2010modulators rather than specifically inhibit the activities of those causing harmful inflammation. Therefore, specific regimens may be designed to include antagonists specifically against the individual PICs, eg MCP\u20101 and TGF\u2010\u03b2, that are highly expressed in the SARS\u2010CoV\u2010infected cells and in elevated levels in blood, plus antiviral drugs for the treatment of patients with SARS. Some drugs that selectively block pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines or their cell receptors may also be used for SARS treatment 51. The phenomenon of the rapidly increased levels of PICs in blood and their positive correlation with the severity of ALI has also been observed in patients who have been infected with other viruses, eg avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 27, 28, 52. This suggests that up\u2010regulation of PIC expression induced in the virus\u2010infected cells may be common mediators of ALI and ARDS in patients who have been infected with viruses via the respiratory pathway. Therefore the anti\u2010PIC strategy may also be applied, in combination with the specific antiviral therapeutics against the corresponding viruses, for the early treatment of these infectious diseases.",

The infected cells under the stimulation of SARS\u2010CoV and some uninfected cells induced by viral antigens or PIC\u2010regulatory factors produce high levels of PICs to mediate inflammatory responses for combating the virus. However, these PICs also damage the host cells.

The activated macrophages can produce more PICs and may transmit SARS\u2010CoV to other sites. Some of the PICs, including TGF\u2010\u03b21 and TNF\u2010\u03b1, may induce apoptotic death of the epithelial cells, pneumocytes, and lymphocytes, or mediate pulmonary fibronosis, resulting in ALI and ARDS. The cell\u2010free and M\u03a6\u2010associated SARS\u2010CoV in the blood can be transmitted from the lung to other organs to infect the ACE2\u2010expressing cells in the local sites. More PICs are produced and the level of PICs in the blood is rapidly elevated, leading to multi\u2010organ dysfunction. M\u03a6 = macrophages; ALI = acute lung injury; PICs = pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines",
