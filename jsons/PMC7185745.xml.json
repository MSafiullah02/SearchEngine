X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy provide the only sources of experimental data at high, often atomic, resolution. Whether there is a correlation between NMR spectral quality and the success rate of crystallisation is a traditional matter of debate. In one initiative, X-ray crystallography is used as the sole method for structure determination; here, protein samples are subjected to fine-screen or coarse-screen crystallisation trials on the prediction basis of 1D 1H NMR spectra [2].",

Protein samples whose HSQC spectra qualified them as poor or unfolded, crystallised with good diffraction properties and vice versa. The authors indicated that unstructured or molten-globule-like proteins with poor HSQC quality should be subjected to HetNOE data and/or 15N transverse or longitudinal relaxation analysis. This procedure provides more quantitative data and may allow detection of equilibria between folded and unfolded states or some partially folded character in the solution state. The crystallisation trials may drive some samples into the folded conformation by mass action effects. Another large-scale analysis of the results of structural genomics initiatives recommends that both methodologies should be used in parallel because of the complementary success rates [4\u2022]. This approach seems justified given the dramatic improvements in the speed of NMR structure determination [5].",

Geometry-based algorithms (e.g. the flood-fill algorithm implemented within Insight (Accelrys)) heuristically search for concave invaginations.

The probability of detecting the binding of a low molecular weight (MW \u223c200\u2013300 Da) fragment with high sensitivity exceeds that of ligands with MW of \u223c500 Da. The functional groups of fragment-based libraries should already include synthetically accessible starting points for chemical linkage. In a follow-up screen, chemical building-block fragments with masked linker groups can be used, an optimisation step in library design called the \u2018fragment pair concept\u2019. One can consider fragment pairs of a synthesis and a screening fragment [29\u2022\u2022]. Another major issue for any library design is the identification of reactive false positives that oxidize or alkylate a protein target. An assay called ALARM-NMR has developed to rule out these compounds. It monitors 13C chemical shift changes of the human La antigen caused by the test compound or mixture. To validate the unwanted reactivity, the same experiment is repeated in the presence of DTT [30].",

Spin-labeled adenine analogues can be used to detect allosteric ligands at ATP-binding drug targets by paramagnetic relaxation enhancement [31]. The same effect can be utilised when the ATP-complexed magnesium ion is replaced by the paramagnetic manganese ion [32]. By these methods, the proximity of potential allosteric inhibitors can be estimated. The effects of antagonists on protein\u2013protein interactions can elegantly be monitored by NMR spectroscopy. When a small protein (e.g. \u223c20 kDa) binds to larger one, the NMR resonances vanish because of excessive line broadening of enhanced relaxation effects in the large macromolecular complex. But the initial NMR spectrum of the small protein can be restored upon addition of an antagonist, which disrupts the protein\u2013protein complex [33].",

Better shielding of NMR magnets in combination with cryo-probe technology enables the combination of liquid chromatography with NMR (LC/NMR). Plant extracts can be investigated in the microgram domain to explore an extraordinary reservoir of novel molecules with potential medical use [34]. Binding to protein targets can be detected by intermolecular magnetisation transfer (e.g. the saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR technique). During the search for novel antibiotics, on-flow LC/1H-NMR can also be combined with bioassays of the sampled fractions. The 1D NMR spectra can be used as \u2018barcodes\u2019 to guide the fractionation of crude natural mixtures, thus avoiding the repetition of biological testing [35]. For the same reason, multivariate pattern recognition is applied to the complex NMR data, which is obtained from HTS extracts from a diverse collection of plants and marine organisms. Different samples that may contain the same bioactive compounds can be identified or clustered together [36]. A further step towards automated analysis of screening spectra was published recently. A wavelet de-noising step can be applied to 1D/2D screening data prior to common algorithms of data reduction and clustering, which improves the separation of outliers (\u2018hits\u2019) from the cluster representing spectra of protein with non-binding ligands [37].",

This data is subjected as restraints to the docking methods, which model the complex from the individual atomic coordinates. The current algorithms allow the incorporation of other NMR-derived data such as cross-saturation transfer experiments, nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) [39], residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) [40] and even data derived from mutational analysis or amino-acid-specific labeling. The recent success in disrupting protein\u2013protein interactions for drug discovery surely fuels the interest in docking protein\u2013protein complexes to guide subsequent research. Applicable tools to model docking complexes with small molecules, which help medicinal chemists to judge structure\u2013activity relationships, have recently been published. One approach can be used as an approximation even in the weak-binding regime of small fragment molecules [41]. Another approach incorporates NMR-NOE data, which can be measured in the tight-binding regime of drug candidates at an advanced optimisation stage [42].

The nuclear Overhauser effect can be transferred from one ligand to the competitive ligand if the two are undergoing rapid exchange. The magnetisation of the first ligand is transferred to the protons of the protein and there it spreads over the interaction surface by spin-diffusion. After replacement, the second ligand picks it up and a correlation peak between both ligand resonances evolves. This information is used for subsequent linker design. The method is described as INPHARMA (protein-mediated interligand NOEs for pharmacophore mapping [44\u2022]) or SAR by ILOE (structure\u2013activity relationship by interligand nuclear Overhauser effect [14\u2022]), which seems to be applicable to any combination of ligands weakly bound to a common receptor.",

Membrane proteins such as neurologically important GPCRs, transporters or ion pumps can be targeted for pharmaceutical drug discovery. Solid-state NMR in drug design still strongly relies on bioinformatic analysis, and the proposed models are refined by the input data of direct experimentation. NMR signals from the ligand provide useful information about its location within the membrane target, its own structure, the dynamic situation and its putative binding site (for review see [45]). The application has been demonstrated with ligand docking to the gastric H+/K+-ATPase, which has already been successfully targeted by omeprazole, lanzoprazole and pantoprazole [46\u2022]. Homology models of the target protein were generated from the templates of the E1\u00b7Ca2+-ATPases and E2\u00b7(TG)-conformer, which are adopted during their catalytic cycle. Several analogues to known inhibitors were synthesised and the conformation of a representative was determined in the presence of gastric H+/K+-ATPase by solid-state NMR. The ligand structure was subsequently modelled into the putative binding volumes in the E1/E2 models. The obtained model is consistent with existing site-directed mutagenesis data.",

Analogous methods for plant extracts such as coupled LC/NMR techniques can be applied. In vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) with the latest high-field instruments enables the analysis of metabolic composition with great spectral dispersion in living tissues [48]. Complementary, ex vivo spectra can be recorded by solid-state NMR from tissue samples that are directly placed into the magic-angle-spinning rotor [49]. Besides the benefits from cryo-probe technology, steady progress has been made because of growing databases, which store the information obtained from animal models and patients. Physiological variations due to species, age, gender, nutrition state etc. are automatically analysed by pattern recognition, and subjected to expert systems [50]. Thus, metabonomic approaches based on information-rich spectroscopic data sets can be used to evaluate normal physiological variation and to investigate drug safety issues.",
