In comparison, although exposed to the same infection source, only the mother's respiratory and stool specimens were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and at a much lower viral load. These findings suggest that COVID-19 could be systemic in neonates, affecting multiple organs, including the kidney and the gastrointestinal tract. Only approximately 1-15% of the adult patients with COVID-19 had RNAemia, and no child with RNAemia has been reported so far [5, 9, 10] . To fight off virus infections in the absence of maternally transmitted IgG antibody, neonates must rely exclusively on their immature innate immune system and their own, also immature, T cells [11] . This makes them vulnerable to viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Although previously reported neonates with 8 COVID-19 went through favorable clinical courses, careful monitoring on this specific population at high risk is still needed until more data are available.",

Although respiratory transmission is the primary route for SARS-CoV-2, presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in both urine and stool in the baby is an important finding because these specimens could serve as additional vehicles for virus transmission. Whether the virus detected in urine and stool is viable and infective needs further research. Nevertheless, caregivers need to be educated to practice proper handwashing especially when changing diapers of neonates and young infants in order to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among household contacts. This report highlights the different clinical manifestations and viral load kinetics of a neonate and her mother with COVID-19. As neonates could have systemic complications and SARS-CoV-2 could be shed for a long time in their urine and stool, close monitoring of neonates with COVID-19 as well as good hygiene practices by caregivers are essential.
