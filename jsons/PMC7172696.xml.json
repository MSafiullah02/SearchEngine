Genomic, anatomic, and behavioral data support the hypothesis that bats have a unique role in hosting infectious agents (Reviewed in (Baker et al., 2013, Schountz, 2014)). Bats (Chiroptera) have traditionally been divided into two major suborders: Megachiroptera (\u201cmegabats\u201d) and Microchiroptera (\u201cmicrobats\u201d). However, based on recent genetic data, chiroptera are now classified as Yinpterochiroptera (Pteropodidae, Rhinolophidae, Hipposideridae, Craseonycteridae, Megadermatidae, Rhinopomatidae) and Yangochiroptera (all other families, including microbats) (Tsagkogeorga et al., 2013). The two orders of bats have a monophyletic origin. Bats are members of the superorder Laurasiatheria, which includes carnivores and ungulates (Peng et al., 1991, Zhou et al., 2012).",

            "text": "The importance of bats as animal reservoirs for emerging pathogens is now widely appreciated. Over a hundred viruses have been detected in bats, including many viruses discovered to be important to human or veterinary disease. Among these are Hendra and Nipah virus, SARS-like coronaviruses, Marburg virus and Ebola virus (Baker et al., 2013, Calisher et al., 2006). Despite hosting numerous viruses, bats do not usually exhibit disease, with the notable exception of rabies virus infection. The presence of persistent viral infections without pathology suggests a co-adaption, thus, how viruses modulate bat-specific immune responses is an important question with respect to zoonotic disease transmission. Aside from their potential role as reservoirs, North American bats are also of interest because several species are threatened by the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans, which causes the disease known as White Nose Syndrome (Lorch et al., 2011; Blehert et al., 2009; Chaturvedi et al., 2010; Field et al., 2015). Millions of bats have succumbed to the fungus, which infects hibernating bats. However, some bat species exhibit greater resistance or susceptibility to disease, implying that qualitatively or quantitatively different immune responses are generated in response to infection.",

While bat immune responses to infectious agents have been studied in both Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera (e.g., (Field et al., 2015), most investigations on components of the bat immune system have been characterized in Megachiropterans. Recent studies, including those that have focused on the immunoglobulin gene locus (Baker et al., 2010, Bratsch et al., 2011, Butler et al., 2011), have provided evidence that there is genetic diversity among the two bat suborders, hence potential unique features of Microchiropterans remain to be identified. Unfortunately, Microchiropteran immunity has been difficult to study for a number of reasons, including limited numbers of animals generally available for study, limited numbers of institutions with facilities for bat research, and, unlike for the mouse, there are no inbred bat strains. A major barrier to studying immune processes is the lack of specific immunological reagents and in vitro experimental models. For example, there are no cell lines of lymphoid origin, and there are few specific antibody reagents for detecting or characterizing bat cells or proteins. Thus, it has been difficult, if not impossible, to identify and/or isolate immune cells, such as lymphocytes, or to monitor cellular or humoral immune responses to infection or immunization.",

We have used this mAb to identify bat antibodies in serum and other body fluids, thereby extending prior genetic analyses of E. fuscus immunoglobulins. We have also used the mAb to identify immunoglobulin-producing B lymphocytes and we demonstrate how B cells are distributed in the bat splenic white pulp.

Five days after the last injection, the spleen from one mouse was removed and a single cell suspension was prepared. To generate hybridomas that secreted bat-specific mAbs, a ClonaCell-HY Hybridoma Kit (Stem cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, CA) was used. Briefly, after lysis of red blood cells, the immune mouse lymphocytes were fused to Sp2/0 myeloma cells (Shulman et al., 1978) using polyethylene glycol. The resulting hybridomas were plated and cultured in methyl cellulose containing selection medium. Fourteen days after the fusion, individual hybridoma clones were picked from the methylcellulose plate and transferred into individual wells of a 96-well tissue culture plate. Two days later, culture supernatants were collected and screened using flow cytometry to identify mAbs which bound to E. fuscus splenocytes. For some hybridoma supernatants, assessment of reactivity with serum proteins was performed using surface plasmon resonance analysis; these analyses were performed by the Wadsworth Center Immunology Core, using a BIAcore 3000 analyzer (GE Healthcare); the sensor chip was coated with a 50% ammonium sulfate (SAS) precipitant of E. fuscus serum.

From a fusion from a single immune mouse, a number of cell-specific hybridomas were generated; the characterization and utility of one hybridoma, BT1-4F10, is described in this report. The initial hybridoma screen was accomplished using flow cytometry to identify hybridomas that secreted mAbs reactive with E. fuscus splenocytes. Hence, all of the selected bat-reactive hybridomas bound to bat cells or to subpopulations of splenocytes (data not shown). Among those hybridomas, BT1-4F10 was unique in that the target antigen was detected not only on a subpopulation (\u223c36%) of spleen cells (Fig. 1\nA), but also as a soluble component in bat serum. The latter reactivity was initially determined using surface plasmon resonance analysis. A BIACore chip was coated with a reconstituted 50% saturated ammonium sulfate (SAS) precipitate of E. fuscus serum and individual hybridoma supernatants were passaged over the chip. The BT1-4F10 supernatant exhibited detectable binding to the serum-coated chip (Fig. 1B), but not to a control mouse (or human) serum-coated chip (data not shown). Given that BT1-4F10 recognized a lymphocyte surface molecule and secreted protein, we hypothesized that the target antigen was immunoglobulin and that the subpopulation of cells recognized by the mAb was sIg-bearing B lymphocytes. Serum immunoglobulin was expected to be enriched in the 50% SAS precipitant used for the BIACore assay; however, other contaminating serum proteins may have been present on the chip. Hence, we next proceeded to directly identify the target antigen in the SAS precipitate.",

To determine the specific antigen recognized by mAb BT1-4F10, the mAb was directly conjugated to magnetic beads and used to immunoprecipitate its target antigen from an SAS precipitate of E. fuscus serum. In addition, another aliquot of the bat SAS precipitate was passaged over a protein G-magnetic bead matrix and both the protein-G-binding and unbound fractions were also immunoprecipitated using BT1-4F10-magnetic beads. Analysis using SDS-PAGE indicated that several proteins were bound by mAb BT1-4F10 (Fig. 2\nA). A primary protein had a molecular weight of \u223c150 kDa, which, upon reduction, resulted in two protein bands of \u223c50 kDa and \u223c27 kDa, which was consistent with the electrophoretic migration of serum IgG in numerous animal species. This same protein also bound to Protein G, further suggesting that it was bat IgG. The 50 kDa band, and an additional non-protein G-binding band ('70 kDa), were excised from the reduced gel and analyzed by mass spectrometry. These studies identified the precipitated proteins as being the E. fuscus immunoglobulin gamma chain and mu chain, respectively. In a subsequent experiment, the band of approximately 27 kDa was excised and analyzed by mass spectrometry; comparison to mammalian databases found its closest match to be the bat Ig lambda7 chain C region of Myotis davidii.

Using HRP-BT1-4F10 to immunoblot an unreduced E. fuscus SAS precipitate, we observed a number of high molecular weight bands. The most prominent bands were of high molecular weight, two \u223c150 kDa proteins, and \u223c25 kDa. However, upon reduction, only a single band of \u223c25 kDa was observed (Fig. 2b).

Purified Ig or serum was obtained from a number of different animal species. ELISA showed that mAb BT1-4F10 bound only to E. fuscus serum and swine IgG, but not to any of the other tested immunoglobulins (Table 1\n). The epitope recognized on swine IgG was also found to be on the light chain, as reduction of the intact IgG showed only the Ig light chain in the both bat and swine samples (Fig. 3\n). In contrast, a commercial polyclonal goat anti-bat Ig serum that had been raised against a mixture of chiropteran IgG that included E. fuscus IgG, exhibited substantially more cross-reactivity with Ig from different species. Indeed, of all the various types of Ig that were tested, only mouse and rat IgG were not bound by the polyclonal preparation (Table 1). We next examined whether mAb BT1-4F7 recognized Ig from bat species other than E. fuscus. We obtained sera from a number of different megabat and microbat species to use as a coating antigens in ELISAs. As expected, the commercial polyclonal anti-bat Ig bound strongly to each bat serum and, less so, to E. fuscus serum (Table 2\n). In contrast, mAb BT1-4F10 did not bind to any of the Megachiropteran sera that were tested. The mAb did, however, recognize Ig from other Microchiroptera (Table 2). As a serum Ab source for microbats, we used saline extracts of heart tissue as the coating antigen and we examined representative cave-dwelling (E. fuscus (Big Brown), Myotis lucifugus (Little Brown)) and tree-dwelling (Lasiurus cinereus, (Hoary), Lasionycteris noctivagans (Silver-haired), Lasiurus borealis (Eastern Red)) bats. mAb BT1-4F10 bound to each of the microbat sera. This assay is not quantitative as the amounts of Ig attached to the wells in each sera may vary. However, when we assessed multiple individual sera, we consistently found a relative binding strength of Big Brown > Little Brown > Hoary > Silverhair > Red bat. Hence, other than its cross-reactivity with swine Ig, mAb BT1-4F10 is highly specific for microbat immunoglobulin.",

Heart extracts from the cave-dwelling and tree-dwelling bats examined above were assessed using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with mAb BT1-4F10. For each of the bat species, we generally observed a similar pattern of bands: high molecular weight proteins, some of which did not enter the polyacrylamide gel; a distinct doublet at approximately 150 kDa, likely IgG subclasses, and the Ig light chain (Fig. 4\n). As would be expected, the putative IgG bands were the most prominent in all of the serum/heart samples. Based upon previous studies, it is likely that the higher molecular weight proteins are serum IgM/IgA, and possibly IgE. Similar patterns were observed in all of the bat species tested. Most of the bands appeared to be of the same size in the different species, except that the putative IgG of Red bats appeared to be of slightly higher molecular weight. We also observed that with greater sample concentrations or longer exposure times, additional lower molecular weight bands could be seen. The identity of these bands is unclear; they may be various forms of the different intact Ig molecules or multimers of the Light chain. Examination of a similar amount of mouse serum showed that free light chains, as well as additional proteins, were observed, although at much lower abundance than was observed in bat samples (Fig. 5\nA). Further, the bands largely appeared to arise during the electrophoresis procedure, as passage of the samples through a 100 kDa membrane prior to electrophoresis showed that the lower molecular weight bands were largely retained in the high molecular weight fraction (Fig. 5B). Mixing increasing amounts of bat serum with mouse serum did not result in the appearance of free mouse light chain, suggesting that bat serum did not contain a high amount of reducing agent that might break inter-chain disulfide bonds (data not shown). If the bat serum was first mixed with protein G-magnetic microbeads, the majority of the lower molecular weight material was in a form that was originally captured by protein G (Fig. 5C). A similar pattern was observed when using protein A-magnetic microbeads (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that in some bat Ig, heavy and light chain pairing is achieved via noncovalent interactions.",

To examine E. fuscus light chains, we mixed serum with Protein L \u2013 magnetic beads. Protein L binds to kappa chains in many, but not all, mammalian species (Nilson et al., 1992) (De Chateau et al., 1993). We also examined protein L reactivity with mouse (predominantly kappa), horse (predominantly lambda), and swine (60% kappa). Examination of both the bound and unbound factions showed that the majority of bat Ig was not bound to protein L (Fig. 6\n). When higher amounts of bat sera were assessed, a Protein L binding light chain was observed. At present, it is unclear if this band is kappa chain or non-specifically retained lambda chain.

For E. fuscus and M. lucifugus, a similar morphology with respect to Ig+ B cells was observed (Fig. 8\n). Well-defined follicles were observed that were distinct from those identified in mice using an anti-mouse Igk mAb. In both bat species, but not in mice, we observed punctate staining of Ig outside of the follicles, which may reflect the presence of bat Ig bound to FcR. Follicle structure appeared to differ in the bats as compared to mouse, but not dissimilar to humans. In particular, the \u201chorseshoe\u201d shape observed for mouse follicles was absent, with bat follicles appearing as circular clusters of B cells. We observed a much denser staining in the center of the follicles. This could indicate the accumulation of secreted Ab or clusters of cells that are actively secreting Ab, or even immune complexes associated with follicular dendritic cells. A similar area of intense staining within the follicle was more clearly seen using fluorescent microscopy (Fig. 9\n).

However, as reports note, such studies face several challenges, not the least of which is a lack of suitable bat-specific reagents (Baker et al., 2013, Schountz, 2014). Few, if any, commercially available Abs reactive with various species also cross-react with bats. Hence, we attempted to address this gap through the generation of monoclonal antibodies that can be used to identify important immune cells and proteins. Our focus has been on Microchiropteran bat species primarily because of their ecological importance in North America, their endangerment by the fungal pathogen Pseudogymnoascus destructans, and their ready availability to us for experimentation.",

This response resulted in many hybridomas that produced mAbs reactive with bat cell surface antigens. As we were initially interested in generating mAbs which might differentiate cell types involved in adaptive immunity, when we performed our initial flow cytometry screen we focused on mAbs that showed heterogeneous binding that separated the splenocytes into two or more subpopulations. We found that, as compared to staining mouse cells, there was a larger amount of non-specific binding, which was somewhat reduced by pre-treatment of the cells with unlabeled rabbit IgG. It is likely that this binding occurs via Fc receptors (FcR). Because we also saw a higher amount of extrafollicular Ig staining by microscopy, we speculate that the overall levels of FcR may be higher in bats than mice. Others have noted that elevated FcR can occur with higher core body temperatures and that higher core body temperatures are associated with flight (Blatteis, 2003, O\u2019Shea et al., 2014, van et al., 1991). This may point to a prominent role for FcR-mediated effector functions, such as opsonization, pathogen clearance or retention of immune complexes for immune memory maintenance.",

            "text": "For this report, we have characterized the binding reactivity of one mAb BT1-4F10. We show that this mAb recognizes an epitope on microbat Ig light chains. Based upon the lack of binding to Protein L, in E. fuscus, the lambda chain appears to be utilized by most, if not all Ig molecules. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that bat lambda chains do not bind to protein L (De Chateau et al., 1993). We do note that genomic sequencing of the closely related M. lucifugus provided no evidence for the presence of genes encoding kappa light chains (Das et al., 2008). We do observe that some E. fuscus light chain bind to Protein L; however, we also find that a similar low level of light chain is bound when assessing sera from M. lucifugus bats (unpublished observations). Hence, for both bat species, this bound material may be lambda light chains. In contrast, other reports, including a recent transcriptome analysis by Papenfuss et al. (Papenfuss et al., 2012), show that other (megabat) bat species do utilize kappa chains. Bats and ungulates are members of the superorder Laurasiatheria. Most ungulates, other than pigs, have a strong preferential usage of lambda chains (Arun et al., 1996, Butler et al., 2006, Hood et al., 1967). Because BT1-4F10 still binds to Ig after fixation (microscopy) or denaturation (western blotting), we suggest it binds to a linear epitope. Much harsher treatment does alter the epitope, as staining is lost when whole tissues are embedded in paraffin and subjected to prolonged fixation (10% formalin overnight) for histology examination (unpublished observations). Among bats, the epitope bound by this mAb appears to be restricted to microbats. However, as we found a range of binding of mAb BT1-4F10 to Ig from different microbat species, it appears that there are some differences in the amino acid sequences which comprise the epitope. Other than an anomalous reactivity with the light chain from swine Ig, mAb BT1-4F10 is specific for Microchiropteran Ig. For a single epitope, the lack of cross-reactivity to Megachiropteran Ig may not be surprising and the degree of immunological difference between the two bat suborders has not yet been fully established. The commercial goat anti-bat Ig, which has been used to previously investigate megabat and microbat immunoglobulins, binds to Ig of both suborders. However, the strength of binding is much greater with the megabat antigens. Since the immunogen used to raise the commercial antisera contained E. fuscus IgG, among 11 different bat species, it is not clear whether the binding is due to cross-reactive Abs or due to a mixture of megabat- and microbat-specific Abs in the antisera. It should be noted that Wellehan et al. have produced a mAb reactive with megabat IgG by immunization of mice with Pteropus hypomelanus IgG (Wellehan et al., 2009). By western blot analyses, that mAb bound to a number of different Pteropus species and had some cross-reactivity with the one microbat tested (Phyllostomus hastatus). Similarly, Omatsu et al., raised a polyclonal anti-IgG serum by immunization of rabbits with Rousettus aegyptiacus and showed substantial cross-reactivity, using an ELISA, with serum from a microchiropteran (an unidentified Philippine insectivorous) bat (Omatsu et al., 2003). In contrast, mAb BT1-4F10 showed no cross-reactivity with either Pteropus hypomelanus or Rousettus aegyptiacus Ig.",

However, the number of IgG subclasses varies between different species. For example, E. fuscus contains two IgG isotypes, whereas M. lucifugus has five (Butler et al., 2011). In the present study, regardless of the microbat species, we were able to readily detect one prominent and one lesser Ig species with the expected molecular weights of IgG. While this could suggest the preferential usage of two IgG isotypes, it also may be that two or more subclasses were not resolved in our gel system. If the former is true, however, this may indicate that there is not as much practical functional difference between the two Microchiropteran species as the number of Ig classes would suggest. These putative IgG classes were not only found in serum but they were the main Ig we detected in saliva. Little IgG was found excreted in feces. Instead we saw evidence for high molecular weight and sub-IgG molecular weight species, with the former likely to be IgA and IgM, both isotypes known to be excreted.",

            "text": "In both serum and feces, the identities of most of the low molecular weight Ig light-containing moieties are unclear. The major protein is unassociated light chain itself. Secreted light chains have been observed in other species, including humans (Dul et al., 1996, Shapiro et al., 1966); an increase in free lambda chains can be associated with pathologies, such as myeloma (Edelman and Gally, 1962). However, most of our data is consistent with the release of light chains from intact immunoglobulins and the subsequent formation of light chain multimers and/or heavy/light chain dimers during the processing of the samples for SDS-PAGE. This, in turn, would suggest that in some portion of the intact Ig pool, there are no interchain disulfide bonds between the heavy and light chains. In their analysis of heavy chain genes in microbats, Butler et al. showed that bat IgA is similar to human IgA2 and IgA in cattle and swine in that all lack the CH1 Cys used in H-L disulfide bridging (pos 15) (Butler et al., 2011). The authors speculated that a different CH1 Cys (pos 77) was used instead to link the heavy and light chains, but left open the possibility for noncovalent associations. Although, cattle and swine appear to secrete only covalently linked IgA, human IgA2 can be secreted as a noncovalently linked molecule (Woof and Russell, 2011). Based on our studies here, we speculate that some portion of secreted bat Ig, perhaps a fraction of IgA, also exists as a noncovalently associated molecule. However, we note that, in serum, the low molecular weight moieties were originally complexed to a protein G-binding Ig. As protein G in most species binds primarily or exclusively to IgG classes, our data might suggest that some IgG contains non-covalently associated H-L chains. However, we do note that in some species, IgA can bind to protein G (Peng et al., 1991). Thus, the Ig isotype origin of the free light chain in bats remains unresolved. In addition to serum, proteins with a lower molecular weight than IgG were also identified in fecal samples, with the major protein being \u223c45 kDa. This protein is likely not derived from IgG as we found little IgG in fecal samples at all. Thus, it is not surprising that the \u223c45 kDa protein did not bind to either Protein G or Protein A. Other proteins were bound to protein G, however, they did not bind to protein A. This result was unexpected given that Protein G is generally considered to have a more restricted specificity than protein A.",

By flow cytometry, nearly 40% of the lymphocytes, chosen based upon forward and side light scatter properties, were B cells. This percentage was slightly lower than typical values (45\u201355%) obtained from mice (Pellegrini et al., 2007) and unpublished observations). For mice, B cell percentages differ in different strains and are influenced by factors such as age, antigen exposure, and inflammation (Pellegrini et al., 2007). As our sampling of bats is still small and, because we examined wild-caught bats with unknown infection history, more studies are required to determine the full range of the B cell contribution to the lymphocyte pool. Still, we report a much lower percentage of Ig+ cells than previously reported by Chakravarty and Sarkar (Chakravarty and Sarkar, 1994). In their study, the authors found that two-thirds or more of Indian fruit bat splenic and peripheral blood lymphocytes bound rabbit anti-IgM or anti-IgG. Whether the difference between these two studies is due to factors such as different bat suborders or species studied, infection history, FcR-binding, etc., is unclear at present. Aside from flow cytometry, we localized B cells in situ. While lymphocytes have been identified in the spleen using electron microscopy and in inflamed tissue sites by histochemistry (Sarkar and Chakravarty, 1991), we believe that ours is the first demonstration of B cell organization in tissues using specific immunostaining. We have used mice for comparison in several of our experiments, although reports have shown that bats and mice are not closely related. This is reinforced by the disparate follicular staining in the spleen. In the mouse, the horseshoe-shaped follicles which wrap around the T cells areas stained relatively uniformly with an anti-kappa chain reagent. We did observe some more intense staining between the follicles which may be plasmablasts. Because nearly all of the mouse B cells express kappa chain (Hood et al., 1967), this staining compares well with the lambda chain staining of bat B cells which are organized into round clusters scattered in the parenchyma. The darker staining within the follicles (brighter staining in the fluorescent images) was not observed in mice. It is tempting to speculate that these are germinal centers (GC). There is no marker for bat GC cells, however, for several species peanut agglutinin (PNA) is used to identify GC cells (Coico et al., 1983). Thus far, we have not had success in staining bat spleens with PNA.",

            "text": "In this report we describe out initial characterization of the E. fuscus B cell compartment of the immune system using mAb BT1-4F10. This mAb also has utility for assessing immune response. Several studies have provided evidence that bat immune responses may possess qualitative, quantitative, or kinetic qualities distinct from those described for mice or man. Co-adaptation of bats and their pathogens highlight the importance of identifying unique aspects of the bat immune system. Reagents such as BT1-4F10 will be necessary to develop diagnostic assays to measure bat immunity. To this end, our pilot studies have shown that this mAb can be used to measure humoral immunity to Pseudogymnoascus destructans (flow cytometry, ELISA) and rabies virus (indirect immunofluorescence) (unpublished observations). Further work will determine the nature of these humoral responses as related to disease resistance and susceptibility.",
