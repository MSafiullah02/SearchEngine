We have also shown that respiratory virus infections commonly cause or are associated with exacerbations of asthma in adults (Nicholson et al., 1993). Taken together these two results suggest that stress should increase the frequency of URTI induced exacerbations of asthma. The present article presents preliminary data on this issue.",

            "text": "It is widely believed that life stressors increase susceptibility to infectious disease. This view is supported by research which has demonstrated direct connections between stress and immune system functioning (Kiecolt-Glaser and Glaser, 1991, Manuck et al., 1991). Similarly, some studies of community samples show that social stressors increase the risk for verified upper respiratory disease (Meyer and Haggerty, 1962, Graham et al., 1986). A viral challenge study provides the strongest evidence for a link between stress and susceptibility to the common cold. Cohen et al. (1991) controlled for exposure to the infecting agent, removed the effect of important predictors of susceptibility such as pre-existing antibodies to the infectious agent, and demonstrated that the effect of stress was not produced by differences in personality or health-related behaviours. Recent studies have extended these results by considering a wider range of psychosocial factors. Cohen et al. (1995) assessed the influence of trait negative affectivity and temporary fluctuations in negative mood (state negative affectivity). Both baseline trait and state negative affectivity were associated with the number of symptoms reported but they were found to have independent effects. State negative affectivity not only predicted symptoms but showed a positive relation with an objective marker of illness, nasal secretion weight. In contrast, trait negative affectivity was associated with symptom reporting but not nasal secretion weight. The effects of stress on health are often mediated by a number of other psychological factors. Social support can often act as a buffer against the effects of stress (Cohen and Wills, 1985) and Cohen et al. (1997) conducted a viral challenge study to determine whether social support played an important role in the development of colds. Social diversity, but not the total number of network members, was associated with a reduction in virus replication, fewer symptoms and lower nasal secretion weights, and increased mucociliary clearance. Turner-Cobb and Steptoe (1996) examined the effects of stress and social support in a diary study of upper respiratory tract illnesses. Under low levels of stress, high levels of social support were associated with a decreased risk of infection, whereas social support had no effect when levels of stress were high. An initial aim of the present study was to examine the associations between psychosocial factors (stress, social support, negative affectivity) and viral excacerbations of asthma.",

Smoking status and alcohol consumption were also recorded as these have been shown to be important predictors of colds (Cohen et al., 1993a).",

Until recently there appeared to be only a weak association between asthma and upper respiratory tract infection in adults (Hudgel et al., 1979, Beasley et al., 1988). The absence of a stronger association in these epidemiological studies of adult asthmatics could, at least in part, have been due to difficulties in isolating human rhinoviruses and coronaviruses. Indeed, results from a study using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays for antibodies to human coronavirus and seminested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions for detections of rhinovirus suggested a stronger role of these viruses in asthma in adults (Nicholson et al., 1993). Details of these results are given below as they not only confirm the importance of URTIs in exacerbating asthma but validate the main outcome measure considered here.",

Indeed, 89% of colds were associated with asthma symptoms. About 70% of laboratory confirmed infections were associated with chest tightness, wheeze and breathlessness. Similarly, acute upper respiratory tract viral infections were associated with objective measures (decreases in peak expiratory flow) of exacerbation of asthma. These results demonstrate that subjective reports of a cold and exacerbation of asthma have been validated using objective indicators of infection and asthma. The data presented in this article were collected to test the hypothesis that psychosocial factors would influence the susceptibility to cold induced exacerbations of asthma.",

Associations between acute respiratory infections and exacerbation of asthma have been noted in previous studies and in an earlier report of the present investigation. The analyses reported here show three different types of effect. The first effect examined was whether psychosocial characteristics and health-related behaviours were associated with the occurrence of cold-induced exacerbations of asthma. These results showed that those who didn't report such an episode were more likely to be male, have lower negative affectivity scores and consume more alcohol. Stress and social report were not significant factors in these first analyses.",

The diagnostic rate for viruses and asthma exacerbations was much higher than in other studies although not as high as might be expected on the basis of symptoms. This probably reflects methodological features of the virology and serology and improvements in the development of sensitive tests may well lead to the view that these non-bacterial pathogens have an even greater role in the exacerbation of asthma. Similarly, the method used to assess peak expiratory flow rates may have missed brief exacerbations, although it did prevent problems of asthma control being included as exacerbations.",

            "text": "In summary, the present study confirmed the view that psychosocial factors and health-related behaviours are associated with increased susceptibility to colds, which then leads to an exacerbation of asthma. This was done in the context of a study where both diseases (cold and asthma) were verified using objective measures. The well-established buffering effect of social support was observed in the high stress group and possible confounders such as demographics, health-related behaviours or personality could not account for this effect. In addition to this, alcohol consumption, personality and demographic factors were shown to be important predictors of susceptibility. In contrast to this smoking was related to illness severity. These results show that one must consider a range of psychosocial factors, personality traits, demographic factors and health-related behaviours in studies of individual differences in susceptibility and severity of upper respiratory tract infections. Such a conclusion fits with the existing literature and the present study has extended the research by considering a population, namely asthmatics, where a cold can have far greater consequences. The literature on asthma also suggests that a variety of factors may have an influence. For example, Klinnert et al. (1994) found associations between life events and asthma and some evidence that social support buffered against stress. Brook and Tepper (1997) found that adolescents with asthma had significantly lower self-esteem than those who did not suffer from asthma. Asthma also tends to be more frequent in females than males and the metabolic changes associated with the menstrual cycle provide a plausible mechanism for gender to be an important factor in susceptibility to asthma attacks (Nagata et al., 1997). Smoking may be important in asthma for two reasons. First, smoking causes direct damage to the respiratory tract which may lead to greater severity of symptoms. Second, smoking will influence the immune system which again may alter the severity of the disease. Moderate consumption of alcohol has been shown to be beneficial in other studies of susceptibility to respiratory diseases (Cohen et al., 1993a) and it is possible that alcohol has an anti-inflammatory action that may be important in asthma. All of these results show the importance of considering a range of variables in this type of study. Identification of the mechanisms underlying the effects reported here is difficult in this type of study. For example, if one examines the variables found to be important in whether a cold/asthma episode was reported or not, one finds that several different interpretations are possible. If one considers the finding that low negative affectivity was associated with a reduced likelihood of reporting an episode then this could reflect several things. First, it could suggest that biases in self-report related to negative affectivity are operating. Secondly, it may be the case that negative affectivity reflects the extent of reactions to stress and those with high levels may be more vulnerable to illness because of this greater reactivity. Similarly, the effects of gender and alcohol consumption are difficult to ascribe to single mechanisms. For example, do the gender differences reflect the biological differences between males and females or correlated psychosocial attributes not measured here? Further research is now needed to determine the mechanisms which underlie these associations.",
