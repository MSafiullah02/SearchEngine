However, the cellular and molecular cues regulating the development of IL-10-producing effector CD8 + T cells are not completely defined. Here, we show that type I interferons (IFNs) are required for the development of IL-10-producing effector CD8 + T cells during influenza virus infection in mice. We find that type I IFNs can enhance IL-27 production by lung APCs, thereby facilitating IL-10-producing CD8 + T-cell development through a CD8 + Tcell-nonautonomous way. Surprisingly, we also demonstrate that direct type I IFN signaling in CD8 + T cells is required for the maximal generation of IL-10-producing CD8 + T cells. Type I IFN signaling in CD8 + T cells, in cooperation with IL-27 and IL-2 signaling, promotes and sustains the expression of IFN regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) and B-lymphocyteinduced maturation protein-1 (Blimp-1), two transcription factors required for the production of IL-10 by effector CD8 + T cells. Our data reveal a critical role of the innate antiviral effector cytokines in regulating the production of a regulatory cytokine by effector CD8 + T cells during respiratory virus infection.",

Upon antigenic encountering chemotactic receptors such as CCR5 and CXCR3 while simultaneously downregulate lymphoid tissue homing receptors such as CCR7 [1, 2] , which allow them to infiltrate peripheral tissues to clear pathogen-infected or transformed cells. In the tissue, effector CD8 + T cells use multiple mechanisms to combat invading enemies. Most prominently, effector CD8 + T cells express key cytolytic molecules including granzymes, perforin, and death receptor ligands and are able to clear virus-infected cells or transformed cells through contact-dependent mechanisms. In addition, effector CD8 + T cells also express multiple antiviral and antitumor proinflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, to inhibit viral replication and kill tumor cells. Notably, these direct and indirect antiviral and tumor activities of effector CD8 + T cells, if unchecked, also can cause severe inflammation and tissue destruction [1, [3] [4] [5] .",

Initially discovered as the proinflammatory \"signal 3\" cytokines, type I IFNs were shown to promote CD8 + T-cell expansion and effector differentiation during bacterial and viral infections [13, 14] . Moreover, type I IFN signaling in CD8 + T cells can protect CD8 + T cell from NK-cell-mediated deletion during chronic virus infection [15, 16] . Besides their role in enhancing antiviral immune responses, type I IFNs signals also promote IL-10 and PD-L1 production/expression and suppress effective CTL responses during chronic LCMV infection [17, 18] , suggesting that type I IFN signaling possesses immune-regulatory functions. Similarly, recent evidence has demonstrated that type I IFNs are required for IL-10 production during influenza infection [19, 20] . Arimori et al. showed that IFN-\u03b1 receptor 1 (IFNAR1) deficient mice exhibited diminished IL-10 levels in the lung, enhanced proinflammatory cytokine production, and increased host mortality following influenza virus infection [20] . However, how type I IFN signaling promotes IL-10 production during influenza infection is currently unknown. Furthermore, given that T cells, particularly effector CD8 + T cells, are a major cellular source of IL-10 during influenza infection, it is important to determine whether and how type I IFN signaling affects IL-10 production of T cells.",

We found that type I IFN signaling is critically important in driving IL-10 production by effector CD8 + T cells, but only plays modest role in promoting IL-10 production by CD4 + T cells during influenza infection. We found that type I IFN signaling promotes IL-27 production by APCs to indirectly facilitate CD8 + T-cell IL-10 production in a CD8 + T-cell-nonautonomous fashion. Interestingly, we found that direct type I IFN signaling in CD8 + T cells is also critical for the maximal generation of IL-10-producing effector CD8 + T cells during influenza infection. Mechanistically, type I IFN signaling, in cooperation with IL-27 and IL-2 signaling, promotes and sustains the expression of Blimp-1 and IFN regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), two transcription factors required for the production of IL-10 by effector CD8 + T cells. Our data have revealed the underlying molecular mechanisms by which innate antiviral effector cytokines regulate the production of a regulatory cytokine by effector CD8 + T cells during respiratory virus infection.",

            "text": "To determine the role of type I IFNs in the development of IL-10-producing effector CD8 + T cells, we infected WT and IFNAR1deficient mice with influenza. At day 7 post infection (at the time when maximal IL-10 was made in vivo) [6, 8] , we stimulated lung T cells with influenza-infected WT BM-derived DCs (BMDCs) and measured IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 production by T cells following stimulation as we previously reported [6, 8] . We found that IFNAR1 deficiency modestly affected IFN-\u03b3 production by CD8 + T cells, but dramatically diminished IL-10 production by CD8 + T cells (Fig. 1A) . We then normalized IL-10 + CD8 + T cells to IFN\u03b3 + CD8 + T cells to determine the relative abundance of IL-10producing cells in IFN-\u03b3-producing antigen-specific CD8 T cells. We found that IFNAR1 deficiency significantly abrogated IL-10producing CD8 + T cells within the antigen-specific CD8 + T-cell population (Fig. 1B) . IFNAR1 deficiency also decreased the percell production of IL-10 by effector CD8 + T cells as the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of IL-10 in IL-10 + cells diminished in the absence of IFNAR1 (Supporting Information Fig. 1A ). In addition, IFNAR1 deficiency diminished IL-10-producing CD4 + T cells (Fig. 1C) , although the relative abundance of IL-10-producing CD4 + T cells in antigen-specific IFN-\u03b3 + CD4 + T cells only modestly diminished in the absence of IFNAR1 (Fig. 1D ). Consistent with their diminished levels of IL-10-producing CD8 + and CD4 + T cells, IFNAR1-deficient mice exhibited diminished airway IL-10 levels and increased airway IFN-\u03b3 levels in vivo during influenza infection (Figs. 1E and F), consistent with the recent findings that type I IFN signaling is required for IL-10 but not IFN-\u03b3 production in vivo during influenza infection [19, 20] . Following type I IFNs engagement, IFNAR initiates downstream events to form a signaling complex consisting of STAT1/STAT2/IRF9, which mediate the major functions of type I IFNs [23, 24] . We therefore examined whether STAT2 is required for the generation of IL-10-producing CD8 + T cells in vivo during influenza infection. We found that normalized percentages of IL-10 + cells in influenza-specific lung CD8 + T cells (IFN-\u03b3 + ) from infected WT or Stat2 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Data in density plots are from a single experiment representative of two to four independent experiments with two to three mice per experiment. Data in graphs are shown as mean + SEM and are representative of two to four separate experiments with two to three mice per experiment.

We also examined IL-10/eGFP expression by influenza-specific PA224 tetramer + CD8 + T cells and found that the deficiency of IFNAR1 resulted in decreased percentages of IL-10/eGFP + cells within PA224 + CD8 + T cell population and diminished IL-10/eGFP MFI ( Fig.  2D -F).

Type I IFNs have been shown to stimulate IL-27 production by APCs [26] . We found that APCs (including macrophages, DCs, and neutrophils) are the main sources of IL-27 expression (particularly p28 subunit) in the lung at day 5 post influenza infection, at the time when effector T cells begin to migrate to the lungs and upregulate IL-10 expression there (Fig. 3A) . Consistent with the previous findings, we found that type I IFNs were able to induce the expression of IL-27 in DCs, macrophages, and neutrophils (Supporting Information Fig. 2) , the main APC types in the infected lungs when CD8 + T cells start to produce IL-10 [27, 28] . Therefore, we reasoned that type I IFNs induce IL-27 production, thereby supporting IL-10 production by CD8 + T cells. To address this hypothesis, we examined the expression of IL-27 subunits in the draining mediastinal LNs (MLN) and the lungs [6, 8] . We found that, compared to those of WT mice, EBV-induced 3 (Ebi3) and p28 expression in the lung of IFNAR1-deficient mice was significantly decreased (Fig. 3B) . Furthermore, airway IL-27 p28 protein levels were also diminished in IFNAR1-deficient mice following influenza infection (Fig. 3C ). Together, these data suggest that type I IFN signaling is required for the optimal production of the IL-10 inducing cytokine, IL-27, during influenza infection.",

To do so, we lethally irradiated WT mice and then reconstituted the mice with 1:1 mixed CD45 mismatched WT and IFNAR1-deficient BM cells (Fig. 4A) . Twelve weeks after reconstitution, we infected the chimeric mice with influenza and found that the T-cell compartments in the lungs of the infected mice were successfully reconstituted with both WT or Ifnar1 \u2212/cells (Supporting Information Fig. 3A) .

We found that IL-10 production by IFNAR1-deficient CD8 + T cells is significantly lower than that of WT CD8 + T cells even within the same hosts ( Fig. 4B and C) . Furthermore, the IL-10 MFI is also significantly lower in IFNAR1-deficient CD8 + T cells than that of WT CD8 + T cells (Fig. 4D) . In contrast, IL-10 production by CD4 + T cells is comparable between WT and IFNAR1-deficient CD4 + T cells (Fig. 4E and Supporting Information Fig. 3B ). Taken together, these data suggest that CD8 + T-cell-autonomous type I IFN signaling is also essential for the maximal development of IL-10-producing effector CD8 + T cells, but not IL-10-producing CD4 + T cells.",

We found that the inclusion of IFN-\u03b1 alone in the culture minimally induced the development of IL-10-producing CD8 + T cells in vitro (Fig. 5A) . However, IFN-\u03b1 helped the development of IL-10-producing CD8 + T cells in the presence of IL-2 and IL-27 ( Fig. 5A and B) , which were reported to induce IL-10-producing effector CD8 + T cells [6] . IFN-\u03b1 also promoted IL-10 mRNA expression in CD8 + T cells in the presence of IL-2 and IL-27 (Fig. 5C ). In addition, although IFN-\u03b1 alone minimally induced IL-10 secretion by effector CD8 + T cells, it greatly enhanced IL-10 secretion by CD8 + T cells in the presence of IL-2 plus IL-27 (Fig. 5D ). Taken together, these data suggested that type I IFNs cooperate with IL-2 and IL-27 to promote IL-10 production by CD8 + T cells.",

We now observed that type I IFNs cooperated with IL-2 and IL-27 to induce the expression of Blimp-1 in CD8 + T cells (Fig. 6A and B). To determine whether Blimp-1 is required for the induction of IL-10-producing CD8 + T cells in vitro, we cultured WT or Blimp-1-deficient CD8 + T cells in the absence or presence of IFN\u03b1, IL-2/IL-27, or IFN-\u03b1/IL-2/IL-27. We found that while IFN-\u03b1/IL- 2/IL-27 induced abundant IL-10-producing CD8 + T cells within WT CD8 + T cells, these cytokine failed to stimulate IL-10 production by Blimp-1-deficient CD8 + T cells (Fig. 6C) . Furthermore, Blimp-1 was also required for the secretion of IL-10 by CD8 + T cells (Fig. 6D) . Thus, these data suggest that Blimp-1 is required for the production of IL-10 by CD8 + T cells upon type I IFN signaling, consistent with the our previous findings that Blimp-1 is essential for the development of IL-10-producing CD8 + T cells in vivo during influenza infection [6] .",

IRF4 was also shown to regulate IL-10 production by effector CD4 + T cells and Foxp3 + regulatory CD4 + T cells [30, 31] . We therefore examined whether type I IFNs signaling promoted IRF4 expression. We found that IFN-\u03b1 was able to cooperate with IL-2/IL-27 to promote and sustain IRF4 expression in CD8 + T cells (Fig. 6E and Supporting Information Fig. 4) . Furthermore, we found that, following the treatment of IFN-\u03b1/IL-2/IL-27, IRF4 expression in CD8 + T cells was required for the production of IL-10 by CD8 + T cells (Fig. 6F and G) . To determine whether IRF4 is required for the induction of IL-10producing CD8 + T cells in vivo, we infected CD8 + T-cell-specific IRF4-deficient mice (IRF4 conditional KO (cKO)) with influenza and examined IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 production following in vitro restimulation. Consistent with our previous data [29] , selective IRF4deficiency in CD8 + T cells diminished IFN-\u03b3 production by CD8 + T cells, suggesting IRF4 is required for the development of antiviral effector CD8 + T cells (Fig. 6H) . When IL-10-producing CD8 + T cells were normalized to IFN-\u03b3 producing effector CD8 + T cell population, we found that IL-10 production was diminished in effector CD8 + T cells in the absence of IRF4 (Fig. 6I) , suggesting that IRF4 is vital for the production of IL-10 by effector CD8 + T cells in vivo.",

Besides their direct antiviral functions, type I IFNs are well known to regulate the development of innate and adaptive immunity during respiratory virus infections [32, 33] . Early type I IFN signaling was important in the production of inflammatory cytokines during influenza infection [34, 35] . Furthermore, type I IFN signaling plays a critical role in regulating the development antiviral CD4 + and CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes during influenza infection [21] . Consistent with their role in promoting inflammation and immunity, overproduction of type I IFNs contributed significantly to the pathogenesis of influenza virus and mouse-adapted coronavirus infection [36] [37] [38] . On the other hand, our data here and results from Arimori et al. have also suggested that type I IFNs could have regulatory role by restricting exuberant inflammatory responses through the induction of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 [20] . Indeed, IFNAR1-deficient mice showed an exuberant host inflammatory response and IL-10 administration could ameliorate excessive lethal inflammation and associated mortality following influenza infection in IFNAR1-deficient mice [20] . Such a regulatory role of type I IFN signaling in inflammation and immunity has been documented during chronic viral infections [17, 18] . Thus, type I IFNs could display differing roles in regulating the development of inflammatory responses and immunity following viral infections, and their exact function in regulating inflammation and immunity would be dependent on the infectious organism as well as the timing and levels of the production of these pluripotent antiviral cytokines.",

Early production of IL-10 during influenza infection could hamper the activation of antiviral innate and adaptive immunity as evidenced by the enhanced resistance to influenza virus infection in IL-10-deficient mice [39] [40] [41] . Conversely, the production of IL-10 at the time of effector T-cell infiltration into the lung (i.e., day 5 and thereafter) could suppress the development of lethal pulmonary inflammation during influenza infection [8, 41] . Similar beneficial effects of T-cell-derived IL-10 have also been reported during RSV and coronavirus infections [7, [9] [10] [11] . Currently, the role of type I IFNs in regulating IL-10 production by human CD8 + T cells has not been investigated. However, a recent clinical study has established that both type I IFNs and IL-10 were elevated in patients with severe influenza virus infection [42] . These data suggested that type I IFNs might facilitate IL-10 production by effector T cells during human influenza infection. Whether IL-10 production is beneficial to the host by keeping inflammation under control or is detrimental to the host by suppressing antiviral immunity in these patients warrants further investigation. However, understanding the timing-and dose-dependent regulating of pulmonary inflammation and immunity by type I IFNs and IL-10 will be insightful for developing novel therapeutic strategies aiming to dampen excessive respiratory inflammation and diseases during severe influenza infection.",

Similarly, we found that type I IFNs could stimulate IL-27 expression in major lung APCs during influenza virus infection, including macrophages, DCs, and neutrophils. Furthermore, IL-27 levels were significantly diminished in the respiratory tract in the absence of type I IFN signaling. Thus, type I IFNs could promote IL-10 production by CD8 + T cells through its indirect effects on regulating IL-27 levels in vivo. Surprisingly, through the mixed BM chimera experiments, we have also established that direct type I IFN signaling is important in IL-10 production by CD8 + T cells during influenza infection. Currently, the relative contribution of the indirect and direct effects of type I IFN signaling in CD8 + T cells in promoting IL-10 production remains to be determined. Further experiments such as supplementation of influenza-infected IFNAR-deficient mice with recombinant IL-27 would be interesting to evaluate with respect to the induction of IL-10-producing CD8 T cells. Nevertheless, type I IFN signaling substantially enhances IL-10 by CD8 + T cells in vitro in the presence of IL-2 and IL-27. At present, the mechanism(s) by which type I IFNs cooperate with IL-2 and IL-27 to promote IL-10 production is unknown. Type I IFN signaling has been shown to sustain the expression of high affinity IL-2 receptor on CD8 + T-cell surface [43] . So, it is possible that type I IFN signaling promotes IL-10 production by facilitating IL-2 and/or IL-27 signaling in CD8 + T cells. Conversely, it is possible that IL-2 and IL-27 treatment could boost IFNAR1 expression and/or its downstream signaling to promote IL-10 expression.",

            "text": "Mechanistically, we found that type I IFN signaling promotes IL-10 production through the concerted action of STAT2, IRF4, and Blimp-1. In a previous report, we identified IRF4 expression as essential for the induction of Blimp-1 and its downstream antiviral effector cytokine molecules in CD8 + T cells [29] . By normalizing IL-10-producing cells to IFN-\u03b3-producing cells, we showed that IRF4 is also critically important for IL-10 production by CD8 + T cells. We speculate that IRF4 functions upstream of Blimp-1 to promote IL-10 expression in CD8 + T cells. However, it is also possible that IRF4 could directly bind to the IL-10 locus to promote IL-10 production in CD8 + T cells since it was shown that the IL-10 locus contains IRF4-binding motifs [30] . The strength of TCR signaling (i.e., high antigen dose and strong peptide affinity) was also shown to be critical for IRF4 expression in CD8 + T cells. Here we have extended previous findings by demonstrating that IRF4 expression is also modulated by cytokine signaling (i.e., type I IFNs). Of note, high-dose antigen stimulation has been shown to favor IL-10 production by CD4 + T cells [44] . We have shown previously that IL-10 production by CD8 + T cells was highly restricted to the early time frame following virus-specific T-cell infiltration to the lungs during influenza infection [8] , at the time when virusderived antigens are plentiful in the infected lungs. Thus, it is possible that both TCR-derived signaling and type-I-IFN-derived signaling are required for the optimal induction of IRF4 and downstream IL-10 production in vivo. These possibilities warrant further investigations.",
