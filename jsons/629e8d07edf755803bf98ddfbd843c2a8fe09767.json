All initial validation studies with the control DNA proved to be type-specific. In order to evaluate the reliability of HPV type-specific LAMP detecting HPV DNA from clinical samples, tissue specimens were obtained from 27 patients with external genital polypoid lesions. The histologic diagnoses included condyloma acuminatum (n \u00bc 21), bowenoid papulosis (n \u00bc 2), seborrheic keratosis (n \u00bc 2), epidermolytic acanthoma (n \u00bc 1), and hairy nymphae (n \u00bc 1). HPV-6 DNA and HPV-11 DNA were detected in 18 and 3 of 21 condylomata acuminata, respectively, and there was no simultaneous infection. HPV-16 DNA was detected in one of two bowenoid papuloses. HPV DNA was not detected in the seborrheic keratoses, epidermolytic acanthoma, and hairy nymphae. These results correlated perfectly with those from real-time PCR analysis. Most positive samples contained high copy numbers of HPV DNA. HPV-11 DNA was detected in one case that could not be detected by PCR. The average reaction time was about 59 min. There was a linear correlation between the genome quantity and reaction time to reach the threshold. The LAMP method has an additional advantage as a quantitative method, and is superior in terms of sensitivity, specificity, rapidity, and simplicity, and can potentially be a valuable tool for the detection of HPV DNA.",

            "text": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a small DNA virus which belongs to the family Papovaviridae, and to date, more than 100 types of HPV have been identified [Syrjanen, 2003] . Condyloma acuminatum is a benign tumor caused by low risk/mucous membranes type of HPV such as HPV-6 or 11 infecting the cutaneomucous regions of the genital and anal areas [Wang, 1993] . A diagnosis is usually made clinically, but there are many tumors that can occur in the skin and mucous membranes. Therefore, clinical diagnosis may not be sufficient, and histopathological diagnosis and virological testing are necessary. Moreover, since high-risk types of HPV associated with cervical cancer and bowenoid papulosis have been detected, identification of genotypes is preferable [zur Hausen, 2001] . Virological testing includes in situ hybridization (ISH), Southern blot hybridization method, dot blot hybridization, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and real-time PCR [Lindh et al., 1992; Brown et al., 1993; Oliveira et al., 1994; Qu et al., 1997; Tucker et al., 2001] . However, detectability using ISH is low. In addition, PCR and real-time PCR need specific expensive equipment such as a thermal cycler, and these methods have not yet become common procedures in hospital laboratories. The loop-mediated isothermal amplification method (LAMP) is a cheap, rapid, and simple gene amplification method that was developed originally by Notomi et al. [2000] as an amplification method instead of PCR, attaining amplification efficiency and sensitivity similar to or higher than PCR. The reaction proceed between 63 and 658C without thermocycling, and all procedures are completed in one step in about an hour when detecting the amplification by the appearance of turbidity in the reaction process. Recently published reports have suggested that LAMP could be an effective method for the rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases [Iwamoto et al., 2003; Kuboki et al., 2003; Maruyama et al., 2003; Parida et al., 2004] . In this study, a LAMP-based HPV typespecific DNA amplification method was developed and were compared its specificity and sensitivity with PCR and real-time PCR. ",

LAMP primers for E6 region of HPV-6, E6 region of HPV-11, E7 region of HPV-16, and E6 region of HPV-18 were designed, using the Primer Explorer V Software (FUJITSU, Tokyo, Japan). The location and sequence of each primer in the target DNA sequences are shown in Figure 1 . LAMP reactions were undertaken with a Loopamp DNA amplification kit (Eiken Chemical, Tochigi, Japan). Reaction mixtures (25 ml) contained 1.6 mM each of inner primer (FIP and BIP), 0.2 mM each of outer primer (F3 and B3), 2 \u00c2 reaction mix (12.5 ml), Bst DNA polymerase (1 ml), and 5 ml of each sample. The mixtures were incubated at 638C for 120 min. Next, turbidity was measured by TERMAMECS LA200 (Teramecs, Kyoto, Japan). The cutoff value of turbidity used to distinguish negative from positive samples was at 0.1, higher than the mean plus three SD of the turbidity of five negative samples. After turbidimetry, the LAMP products were subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.5% SeaKem TM ME agarose (Cambrex Bio Science, Rockland, ME) gel stained with ethidium bromide. To avoid contamination between the samples, DNA extraction and LAMP were carried out in different rooms, and pipette tips with filters for aerosol prevention were used.",

LAMP proved to be rapid, highly sensitive, highly specific, and simple, suggesting that it might be used for rapid diagnosis. LAMP for the detection of HPV was developed and the sensitivity and specificity of LAMP were compared with those of PCR and real-time PCR for the detection of HPV. A pair of primers in the E1 region was designed at first, but since there is 90% homology between the PCR products of HPV-6 and HPV-11, cross-hybridization occurred between HPV-6 and HPV-11. In addition, portions of the E1 gene show greater homology and may be deleted often during HPV integration. Therefore, a pair of primers in the E6/E7 region was designed, since portions of the E6/E7 show smaller homology, and are retained and are expressed usually even when HPV integrates into cellular chromosomes. HPV type-specific LAMP amplified only the respective type of HPV DNA with no cross-reactivity. This specificity was confirmed by two independent detection methods, turbidity assay and agarose gel electrophoresis. The detection limit for HPV type-specific LAMP by the turbidity assay was 1,000 copies/tube. In contrast, the detection limit for HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18 type-specific LAMP by agarose gel electrophoresis was 100 copies/tube, 100 copies/tube, 1,000 copies/tube, and 100 copies/tube, respectively. Although the turbidity assay is less sensitive than agarose gel electrophoresis , the ease and rapidity of the turbidity assay make it more appropriate for clinical monitoring. Furthermore, this system also minimizes potential contamination because tubes are closed during amplification and detection of amplified DNA.",

            "text": "The reliability of HPV LAMP was evaluated for the detection of viral DNA from clinical samples. Since the turbidity analysis seemed to be the most appropriate test for clinical laboratory use, this assay was used for clinical sample analysis. HPV-6 DNA and HPV-11 DNA were detected in 18 and 3 of 21 condylomata acuminata, respectively, without concomitant infection. HPV-16 DNA was detected in one of two bowenoid papuloses. HPV DNA was not detected in seborrheic keratosis, epidermolytic acanthoma, and hairy nymphae. These results correlated perfectly with those from real-time PCR analysis. Most of the positive samples contained high copy numbers of viral DNA. HPV DNA was not detected in samples that were negative by LAMP. Among three HPV-11 positives by LAMP, one was negative by PCR. Therefore, the sensitivity of HPV type-specific LAMP was nearly the same as that of realtime PCR and was greater than that of PCR, for the detection of HPV infection, demonstrating the high sensitivity and specificity of HPV type-specific LAMP in the analysis of clinical samples. As for sample No. 23 of bowenoid papulosis, HPV was not detected by the LAMP method, PCR, and real-time PCR, but HPV-56 was detected by the Hybrid Capture II assay. Recently, the detection of various types of HPV has been reported [zur Hausen and de Villiers, 1994 ]. This LAMP method may not be useful for detection of broad HPV genotypes. However, there was a linear correlation between the genome quantity and reaction time to reach the threshold by the LAMP method, making quantitation of HPV DNA in clinical samples possible. Several studies showed that an increased HPV-16 viral load correlated with the risk for cervical carcinoma [Peitsaro et al., 2002; Ho et al., 2005] . The presence and quantity of HPV DNA are likely to be a reflection of metastasis and may have a prognostic value. Therefore, this assay may be useful to study the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and monitoring vaccine trials of HPV. The average reaction time of HPV type-specific LAMP was about 59 min, not more rapid than that of other viruses, mainly measles virus , influenza virus [Ito et al., 2006] , or herpes simplex virus [Sugiyama et al., 2005] . Therefore, modification of primer design or induction of loop primers may be necessary to shorten the reaction time in future analyses, as additional loop primers increase the amplification efficiency [Nagamine et al., 2001] . In summary, by setting a type-specific primer in the E6/E7 region, a new type-specific method for the detection of HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18 was developed. The sensitivity of amplification of LAMP for detection of viral DNA was nearly the same as that of real-time PCR. Cross-reactivity was not observed, and reliability of testing with clinical specimens was demonstrated. The LAMP method is superior in terms of sensitivity, specificity, speed, and simplicity, and can potentially be a valuable tool for the detection of HPV DNA in laboratories.",
