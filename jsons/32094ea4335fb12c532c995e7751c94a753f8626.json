The need for scalable, easy-to-use, accurate methods to detect SF medications continues to grow. We conducted a proofof-principle laboratory and field-sample evaluation of MedSnap in Vientiane, Lao PDR. Over three days, MedSnap models were created from trusted and authentic medications and tested against samples of authentic/trusted or falsified artesunate, artemether-lumefantrine, azithromycin, and ciprofloxacin. Across 49 tests of authentic/trusted and falsified samples, MedSnap was 100% sensitive and specific. On the final day of the study, a convenience sample of ciprofloxacin and azithromycin was collected from local pharmacies and tested. Each purchased sample matched an authentic or trusted model. The speed and ease of data collection, reference model building, and sample testing suggest scalable use cases for the system.",

Images are uploaded to cloud-based servers where statistical models of 25 visual features are built. MedSnap VR then uses those models to evaluate the precise appearance of tablets and capsules and returns results on whether or not the tested sample is visually consistent with known authentic products.",

Administrators of a MedSnap project can decide what is likely authentic or trusted, create authentic models on these samples, quickly conduct field testing, and definitive testing of chemical authenticity of the trusted medications can be completed at a future date if required -speeding the entire cycle of work.",
