Binding of S to host cell angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is thought to be critical for cellular entry. The host range of the virus extends far beyond humans and non-human primates. Natural and experimental infections have confirmed high susceptibility of cats, ferrets, and hamsters, whereas dogs, mice, rats, pigs, and chickens seem refractory to SARS-CoV-2 infection. To investigate the reason for the variable susceptibility observed in different species, we have developed molecular descriptors to efficiently analyze our dynamic simulation models of complexes between SARS-CoV-2 S and ACE2. Based on our analyses we predict that: (i) the red squirrel is likely susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and (ii) specific mutations in ACE2 of dogs, rats, and mice render them susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

            "text": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the recent Coronavirus Disease (COVID- 19) pandemic. 2 SARS-CoV-2 and the related SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), which caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in [2002] [2003] [2004] , are different strains of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus of the family Coronaviridae. Coronaviruses (CoV) are enveloped viruses that present characteristic spike (S) glycoproteins on the surface of infectious virions that are essential for viral entry. 3 S is a trimeric glycoprotein containing two functional subunits. 4 The first subunit (S1) is responsible for binding to the host cell receptor, Angiotensin converting enzyme 2. The second subunit (S2) is responsible for the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. The S1 subunit harbors the receptorbinding domain (RBD), which is responsible for binding to host cells. 3 The SARS-CoV-2 RBD forms an antiparallel \u03b2-sheet structure, which is connected via short helices and loops. 5 The contact to the host receptor is mainly established via loops known as the receptor-binding motif (RBM, Figure 1A ). Compared to the SARS-CoV the RBM of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less restricted in its conformation, because four of five prolines present in a loop structure essential for binding to the ACE2 protein are replaced by more flexible residues such as glycine in the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. 6 ACE2 is a membrane-bound zinc-metalloprotease expressed on the surface of cells not only in the respiratory tract but also in the heart, arteries, kidneys, and intestines were it acts as critical player in the endocrine renin-angiotensin system. Independent of its enzymatic function, ACE2 functions as the cellular entry receptor for coronavirus infections. The SARS-CoV-2 S shows nanomolar binding affinity to this cellular receptor. 7 ACE2 forms a big substrate-binding cleft between the subdomains I and II. 8 The SARS-CoV S binds to the ACE2 exploiting a non-competitive binding site on the outer site of subdomain I ( Figure 1A , B).",

The multiple sequence alignment of canine, feline and human ACE2 orthologs revealed that the residues reported as hotspots 5, 9 (referred to the human sequence positions 31, 34, 35, 41, 79, 82, and 83; canine positions are numbered one value lower than other species) show polymorphic mutations H34/33Y in dog and M82/81T in dog and cat. Since the difference in position 34/33 is present in dogs only, we searched for sequences harboring the same polymorphism. We found that ACE2 of common ferret (Mustela pultorius) also contains a tyrosine at this position. However, ferrets can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 10 , which suggests that the H34Y polymorphism does not prevent viral entry. Moreover, we compared ACE2 sequences from rodents (mouse, rat, hamster, and red squirrel) to sample additional binding pockets in the ACE2-RBD interface and predict susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 of the red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris).",

ACE2-RBD-complex simulations were prepared with Maestro 11.7 [Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC: New York, USA] and carried out with Desmond 5.5. 16 All systems were inspected for atom clashes, optimized for H-bonds, filled in 12 \u00c5 large padding box with SCP water model 17 , sodium chloride 0.15 M and sodium ions to keep isotonic and electrostatic neutral conditions. The simulations were performed under default minimizing protocol and periodic boundary conditions over 100 ns resulting in 2000 frames each simulation. For visual inspection, all trajectories were wrapped and aligned on backbone C\u03b1 atoms of ACE2-RBD-complex and first simulation frame using VMD 1.9.3. 18",
