            "text": "The pandemic involving the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had its roots in Wuhan, China, in November 2019, and is attributed to what came to be called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1]. Early patients presented with symptoms of severe pneumonia, including fever, dry cough, and respiratory distress. Due to the high transmission rate characterising the virus, it has gone on to pose a control challenge for healthcare systems around the world [2] . Although infection rates in China are said to have been controlled by way of stringent public-health measures, several European countries have seen exponential in-creases in numbers of infected and deceased COVID-19 patients recently. It is thus crucial for other countries to prepare their responses to the pandemic, in circumstances in which effectiveness is seen to depend crucially on rapidly-introduced prevention and control measures, including early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and quarantine, as well as a reduction in secondary infections among healthcare professionals [3] .",

            "text": "A real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for COVID-19 has been developed and is in use in clinics [4] . Some authors thus underline that, as PCR tests have become the only diagnostic criteria for SARS-CoV-2 infection, imaging should not be a primary means of diagnosis [5] , unless the patient is in a critical condition or PCR tests are unavailable. In line with this view, the primary role of both X-ray and computed tomography (CT) imaging studies is to assist in establishing how to manage the patient, the assessment of complications, and differential diagnosis [5] . Other authors [6, 7] point out that the sensitivity of PCR tests remains low, in contrast to chest CT, which may be helpful in rectifying false negatives obtained from RT-PCR during the disease's early stages of development.",

For these reasons, standard procedures will need to be established for each radiology department (RD), and adapted to local conditions. These procedures will nevertheless need to encompass: 1. General rules of conduct minimising the risk of infection to staff. 2. Safety measures surrounding patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV2 infections. 3. The use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by staff. 4. The use of portable X-ray machines. 5. Patient transport to and from radiology departments; and safety measures applying to waiting rooms. 6. Imaging studies on stationary X-ray/CT scanners; with subsequent decontamination of machines. 7. Indications for imaging studies in patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
