In the United Kingdom, around 40% of the domestic cat population has been infected with FCoV and in multicat households, this figure increases to 90%. [1] [2] [3] Natural infections with FCoV are often transient and asymptomatic or result in mild gastrointestinal disease. In these cases, the causative FCoV is sometimes referred to as feline enteric coronavirus. However, in some animals, FCoV infection results in the systemic disease of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), 4 and in these cases the virus has been referred to as FIP virus. FIP usually arises sporadically and unpredictably within a subpopulation or a group of cats. 4 Epizootic FIP, in which FIP arises at an above average frequency in a single locality over a short period of time, is far less common. 4, 5 The pathogenesis of FIP has been investigated for over 40 years, 4 but remains incompletely understood. Viral factors are thought to be important: in experimental studies FCoV obtained from FIP-affected cats and FCoV obtained from the feces of asymptomatic cats manifest their respective pathogenic phenotypes (FIP or no to mild enteric disease, respectively) when inoculated into cats. 4 Accordingly, 1 recent hypothesis states that there are distinct populations of virulent (FIP-associated) and avirulent (largely localized to the intestines) FCoV strains circulating in cat populations, and that these are independently acquired: this is known as \"the circulating virulent/avirulent\" hypothesis. 6 An alternative hypothesis states that FIP arises within individual infected cats as a result of mutation (s) in the virus genome: this is known as \"the internal mutation\" hypothesis.

In each case, the diagnosis of FIP is supported by the amplification of FCoV RNA from their respective tissue or ascitic fluid samples. Unfortunately, the true incidence of FIP was unknown because of the high throughput of cats within the center and minimal available follow-up data. Of the 16 fecal samples collected from contemporaneous asymptomatic cats, 9 (56%) contained FCoV RNA. This is similar to what was found in a study that identified FCoV shedding in 60% of cats 1 week after arriving at a rescue shelter. 18 More than 1 year postsampling, 5 of the 9 contemporaneous asymptomatic cats remain alive and without any signs that could be suggestive of FIP over 1 year postsampling. We therefore suggest that these isolates can, with some certainty, be considered as feline enteric coronavirus infections based on their biological behavior. However, as noted, four of the contemporaneous asymptomatic cats were euthanized subsequently. Two of these cats were euthanized at the rehoming center with nonspecific clinical signs; the other 2 cats had developed signs potentially consistent with FIP (eg, malaise, abdominal fluid) after rehoming to new owners and had been euthanized (postmortem samples were not available). Consequently, we are unable to assign the samples from these animals to the FIP or nonFIP groups.

In 1 study of 73 FCoV seropositive multicat households FIP was encountered at an incidence rate of 4.8% within the first 3 years of entering the household. 19 In contrast, an epizootic FIP outbreak is defined as occurring where there is an incidence of FIP greater than 10% in cats within an establishment, 20 and the higher incidence of FIP will clearly facilitate the collection of relevant samples. However, very few epizootic FIP outbreaks have been described in the literature. 5 The primers designed for this study targeted a number of regions within the FCoV genome. The sites chosen are representative of regions of low (aminoproximal region of the surface protein), intermediate (membrane protein), and high (carboxyl-proximal region of nsp12) conservation, as well as a region that is variable in length (amino-proximal region of nsp3). Consequently, taken together, these amplicons provide an overall picture of genetic relatedness and are appropriate for phylogenetic analysis. The primers in combination with a high-fidelity DNA polymerase (iProof High-Fidelity) were successful in generating amplicons of the correct size for all samples, except for the tissue of 1 FIP-affected cat (Z-FIP). In this case, using the surface protein gene primer pair, a diffuse band of a lower molecular weight PCR product was generated.
