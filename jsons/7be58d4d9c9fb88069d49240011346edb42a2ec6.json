Given the high prevalence and frequent extended shedding of HBoV and HRV, it is not surprising that these viruses were frequently detected in coinfections. This may simply be a result of persistent infection extending over a prolonged time period, making it more likely for an infection with a second virus to occur. The impact of persistent shedding on the severity of incident illness remains unknown. Our study found prolonged shedding of HRV for up to 41 days by PCR and of HBoV for up to 44 days following the onset of initial symptoms. We did not detect any extended shedding of HBoV when it was detected alone, yet extended shedding of HBoV was detected in 36% of multiple virus illnesses, similar to other studies evaluating HBoV time. This suggests that 2 potential pathways of HBoV infection may exist: one with a short, acute, and more symptomatic, single virus infection ( perhaps the primary infection) and the other pathway with a long-shedding, perhaps more indolent, infection during which other viruses are frequently detected. Long shedding patterns add another perspective to the ongoing challenge to determine when a detected virus is actually the cause of clinical symptoms [41, 42] . Reports of high rates of viral detection among asymptomatic children [25, 37, 43, 44] emphasize that not all viruses detected from a patient are necessarily causal agents of disease in that individual at the time they are detected. Our data showing extended detection of respiratory viruses emphasize the need for caution when studying associations between respiratory viruses and illness symptoms, particularly when using cross-sectional sampling to evaluate the clinical correlates of newly discovered viruses.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1348, "end": 1352, "text": "[41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1353, "end": 1356, "text": "42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1428, "end": 1432, "text": "[25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1433, "end": 1436, "text": "37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1437, "end": 1440, "text": "43,", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1441, "end": 1444, "text": "44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "We did not have the benefit of daily sample collection, which would have allowed us to pinpoint the exact duration of shedding of each of the viruses; instead we collected samples only at 7-10 day intervals, making it likely that we have underestimated duration of shedding overall (Table 3) .

Semiquantitative results were obtained for rhinovirus, which had a median cycle threshold (Ct) of 28.2 (range,16.6-40). HRV viral load, approximated by Ct was significantly lower when detected along with HMPV (median 33 with HMPV vs median 28 in all other HRV detections). No other significant associations in prevalence or quantity of specific virus combinations were found, and no overall association was found between viral load and the presence of multiple viruses.The proportion of subject swabs with multiple viruses detected changed as respiratory illnesses progressed from week to week, as did the prevalence of individual viruses (Figure 2). The viruses detected at illness onset (week 0) did not fully represent all viruses detected throughout the course of illness, as additional incident viruses appeared at weeks 1 through 4 of follow-up. The frequency of additional virus detection during follow-up varied by specific virus: only 1 of 53 (2%) RSV detections occurred for the first time after one week of illness, followed by 6 of 78 (8%) for PIV types 1-4, 4 of 26 (15%) for HMPV, 14 of 70 for HCoV (20%), 3 of 15 (20%) for influenza, 25 of 121 (21%) for HBoV, 27 of 122 (22%) for AdV, and 38 of 223 (17%) for HRV. We also found that the duration of documented shedding varied by specific virus. Extended shedding (defined as sequential detections of the same virus at least 7 days apart with no more than a single interim negative) was documented in 0 of 15 (0%) cases of Flu A and B, 3 of 26 cases (12%) of HMPV, 12 of 53 cases (23%) of RSV, 35 of 121 cases (29%) of HBoV, 40 of 122 cases (33%) of AdV, 24 of 70 cases (34%) of HCoV, 62 of 223 cases (28%) for HRV, and 34 of 78 cases (44%) for PIV1-4. The occurrence of extended shedding was associated with MVIs for HBoV (0 of 24 SVI vs 35 of 97 MVIs, P < .001, Fisher exact test), and HRV (2 of 76 SVIs vs 60 of 147 MVIs, P < .001, Fisher exact", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "Correlations between the presence and quantity of 15 viruses and subtypes detected in 823 swabs from children with mild to moderate respiratory illness.
