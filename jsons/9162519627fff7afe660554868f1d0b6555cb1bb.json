It mostly affects postmenopausal women and a history of stress or acute illness can often be elicited preceding the presentation [2] . We report a case of Tako-tsubo Cardiomyopathy in an 85-year-old female brought on by anxiety related to current COVID-19 pandemic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such reported case.",
