However, it is necessary to consider that Italian National Health Service does not recommend performing swab tests in asymptomatic cases, while three out of six of our positive patients underwent swab tests after a suspect CT scan, which was regularly planned for cancer evaluation. Those patients presented with no or minimal symptoms and would not have been tested for COVID-19 in the absence of a suspicious CT scan. Another limitation in interpreting our results may be related to the different timing of adoption of the containment measures; during a pandemic, management has been gradually implemented according to both Institute internal actions and national/international indications. As a consequence, the results of our measures may dependent on time, and a more extensive observation will be likely to observe even better outcomes in terms of cancer care management.",
