We investigate this problem using the SIR model for the epidemic dynamics, for which reduction of the epidemic peak IP can be achieved only at the price of increasing the time tP of its occurrence and its entire time-span tE. By means of a time reparametrization we linearize the equations for the SIR dynamics. This allows us to solve exactly the dynamics in the time domain and to derive the scaling behaviour of the size, the timescale and the speed of the epidemics, by reducing the infection rate \u03b1 and by increasing the removal rate \u03b2 by a factor of \u03bb. We show that for a given value of the size (IP , the total, IE and average\u00ceP number of infected), its occurrence time tP and entire time-span tE can be reduced by a factor 1/\u03bb if the reduction of I is achieved by increasing the removal rate instead of reducing the infection rate. Thus, epidemic containment measures based on tracing, early detection followed by prompt isolation of infected individuals are more efficient than those based on social distancing. We apply our results to the COVID-19 epidemic in Northern Italy. We show that the peak time tP and the entire time span tE could have been reduced by a factor 0.9 1/\u03bb 0.34 with containment measures focused on increasing \u03b2 instead of reducing \u03b1. *",

In order to tackle the ongoing epidemic, the countries faced with the COVID-19 epidemic have used different strategies. In order to control the epidemic one has to lower the basic reproduction number (also called basic reproduction rate) \u03c1, eventually below the threshold, i.e \u03c1 < 1. In a simple SIR Model [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] , which we consider in this paper, \u03c1 depends on the infection rate \u03b1, the removal rate \u03b2 and the total population N . If \u03c1 > 1 the epidemic starts with the number of infected individuals I growing exponentially, it reaches a maximum I P at a time t P , then decreases down to zero at time t E when the epidemic ends.",

The structure of the paper is as follows. In Sect 2, by means of a time reparametrization, we are able to linearize the equations for the SIR dynamics. This allows us to solve exactly the dynamics in the time domain and to derive the scaling behaviour of I P , t P , t E and d\u03c1/dt| P , by reducing the infection rate \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b1/\u03bb or by increasing the removal rate \u2192 \u03bb\u03b2. We show that keeping I P fixed its occurrence time t P and t E can be be reduced by a factor 1/\u03bb by acting on the removal rate \u03b2 instead on the infection rate \u03b1. This will be discussed in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4 we discuss approximate solutions of the SIR model in which the reproduction number \u03c1 < e. In Sect. 5 we apply our results to the COVID-19 epidemic in Northern Italy. We show that the peak time t P and the entire time-span of the epidemic could have been reduced by a factor 0. 9 1/\u03bb 0.34 with containment measures focused on increasing \u03b2 instead of the reducing \u03b1.

Choosing measures increasing the removal rate \u03b2 by a factor \u03bb instead of reducing the infection rate \u03b1 by a factor 1/\u03bb allows to drop t P and t E by a factor 1/\u03bb. For instance by implementing epidemic containment measures with \u03bb = 2 we can reduce by a half both the time needed for the epidemic to reach the peak and the whole time-span of the epidemic. It should be noticed that this epidemic timescale reduction effect becomes more relevant for epidemics with high reproduction number \u03c1 0 >> 1. In fact the factor \u03bb is limited by \u03bb < \u03c1 0 , simply because for \u03bb > \u03c1 0 the epidemic does not develop at all. Thus, if we have for instance \u03c1 0 = 5 we can reduce the peak time and the entire time-span of the epidemic until a factor of 1/5. Therefore, increasing \u03b2 represents an efficient way to fight epidemics. If by increasing it we manage to bring \u03c1 below the threshold we simply stop the epidemic, but even if we do not go so far, we can still reduce the size of an epidemic keeping under control its timescale.",

(9a)...(9d) we compute for these values of the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 the peak quantities: peak amplitude I P , the time t P (in days) of occurrence of the peak (computed by numerical evaluation of the integral (9d)), average number of infected I P and absolute value of the epidemic speed at the peak |V P | (in days \u22121 ). Moreover, using Eqs. (11), (12), (10), together with Eq. (9d), we compute numerically the total number I E of infected individuals during the epidemic and its whole time span t E (in days). The results are shown in Table I . Our results are in accordance with the scaling behaviour given by Eqs. (16a),(16b), (17)and (18). We see from Table I that the raising of the epidemic threshold for \u03b3 from the initial value \u03b3 0 first to 2\u03b3 0 then to 2.9 \u03b3 0 let both the number of infected at the peak and their average number drastically sink from the order of magnitude 10 6 first to 10 5 and then to 10 3 \u2212 10 4 . This reduction is the same independently of the fact that if it is achieved by reduction of \u03b1 (way (1)) or by increase of \u03b2 (way (2)). Similarly, the total number I E of infected individuals drops from the huge value 1 1.88 \u00b7 10 7 till 1.16 \u00b7 10 7 (for \u03bb = 2) and then to 1.3 \u00b7 10 6 (for \u03bb = 2.9)",

Using an exact solution for the epidemic dynamics we have been able to derive the scaling behaviour of these quantities under change of the two parameters (the infection rate \u03b1 and the removal rate \u03b2) of the SIR model, which can be controlled by the containment measures.

He found that simple early detection and contact tracing, while having an impact on the epidemic peak, do not substantially affect the timescale of the epidemic. On the other hand he also showed that contact tracing if followed by prompt isolation is the only efficient way to reduce the size of the epidemic, without having to live with it a long time. The Veneto experience shows that this was one of the factors underlying the success of the containment strategy in that region. Thus the main lesson one can draw from our results is that, epidemic containment measures focused on tracing, early detection followed by prompt removal of infected individuals are more efficient to fight epidemics than those based on social distancing.",

Generalisations of it are necessary in order to give a good descriptions of real epidemics. For instance, in the case of the COVID-19 epidemic a generalization of the SIR model seems to be necessary in order to take into account the presence of a large set of a asymptomatic infective [9, 10, 11] . On the other hand, the SIR model gives the bare bones of deterministic epidemic dynamics. For this reason we believe that, at least at qualitative level, the main result of this paper -the possibility to reduce the epidemic peak keeping under control its timescale by acting on removal rates-could remain true for generalized and improved SIR-like models.",
