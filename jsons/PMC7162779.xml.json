There are currently no reports on the outcomes of these patients, however early accounts on the outcomes of patients with cancer infected with COVID-19 indicate a 3.5 times higher risk of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation or dying compared with patients without cancer.[2] As this virus continues to spread throughout the United States many hospitals have worked rapidly to conserve resources and to protect patients in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Avoiding exposure by adhering to good hygiene practices and social distancing are the only prevention strategies as there are no approved treatment options or available vaccine.[3] Patients with hematologic malignancies receiving HCT or cellular therapy in many cases cannot have their treatment delayed. There are limited recommendations for pharmacist practices working with HCT and cellular therapy patients. We remain a critical and required component of the health care team and must ensure we can continue to monitor patients, provide clinical recommendations and provide critical education to patients in need.[4] The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) Pharmacy Special Interest Group (SIG) Steering Committee provides this position statement for pharmacy practice management and clinical management recommendations for COVID-19 in HCT and cellular therapy patients.",

Many of these recommendations are also applicable to other vital members of the HCT team. When making initial preparations, consideration should be given to staffing models and exploring what work must be done in person versus virtually. Attention should be given to staff members who are themselves immunosuppressed and or have family members that are at high risk for complications of COVID-19.

If attending in-person rounds are deemed necessary, we recommend the following: avoid entering patients\u2019 rooms if possible, conserve personal protective equipment (PPE), remain 6 feet from other team members, and dress in scrubs that can be routinely laundered. Institution provided scrubs and laundry service could be an ideal resource if available. Documentation, communication, and patient monitoring should be done in a workspace separate from other team members. Some practice models may have the ability to limit the pharmacist to exclusive virtual rounding.

If these technologies are not available, we encourage coordination with other team members who are already taking care of the patient for delivery of education materials and customized calendars prior to planned education sessions to minimize patient exposure. Patient counseling should occur over the phone when possible; however virtual visits may be supported at some institutions.

Successful delivery of these services has required integration into clinic workflows. Such integration is valuable to providers and patients alike. In the face of COVID-19, pharmacists are now challenged identifying creative and innovative ways to deliver these services to ambulatory transplant patients while minimizing viral spread in a high risk, immunocompromised population. This has required that pharmacists depend on established relationships with their teams to provide care while protecting the health of both of patients and their colleagues.

Alternatively, some institutions may have a team of clinical-based HCT pharmacists. These pharmacists can implement rotations that allow them to maintain onsite direct patient care services, while simultaneously limiting the personnel in clinic. This may involve pharmacists rotating onsite coverage by certain days of the week or adopting a week-long rotation for improved continuity. Lastly, pharmacists in the ambulatory HCT setting may have administrative days built into their staffing model as well. These days are usually when pharmacists are not engaging in direct patient care visits but are conducting indirect patient care activities including progress note documentation, phone call follow up and medication and care coordination. These indirect patient care days are ideal opportunities for pharmacists to work remotely to limit exposure and contact.",

If able, providing this at-the-elbow support onsite can help maintain clinic workflow efficiency and throughput.

            "text": "Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have garnered significant interest as potential options for treating COVID-19. In-vitro data demonstrates possible viral inhibition by increasing the pH of intracellular lysosomes and endosomes leading to decreased viral membrane fusion.[9] Other mechanisms of viral inhibition involve alterations to glycosylation of ACE2 as well as blocking transport and subsequent release of the viral genome.[9], [10], [11] Pharmacodynamically, both CQ/HCQ are readily bioavailable drugs (\u223c89 and 74%, respectively) with rapid peak concentrations and display multi-compartment pharmacokinetics with significant tissue distribution and long terminal half-lives (30-40 days).[11], [12], [13], [14] They are converted to active metabolites by cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP 3A4, 2D8, and, to a lesser extent, 2D6. Both drugs have also been shown to moderately inhibit CYP 2D6.[15] Based on metabolic pathways, administration with CYP 3A4 or 2D8 inhibitors may result in decreased active CQ/HCQ concentrations and co-administration with 2D6 substrates may increase the concentration of the co-administered drug. There have been two case reports of significantly elevated cyclosporine concentrations when given in combination with CQ but no documented DDI with tacrolimus: suggesting the interaction was not CYP mediated.[16,17] The frequency, significance, and mechanism for the reported interaction with cyclosporine is unknown and routine pharmacokinetic monitoring is recommended. Regarding administration of either agent, it is recommended to avoid giving antacids within 4 hours to ensure absorption. In patients with compromised oral intake (e.g. mucositis), HCQ cannot be crushed at the bedside and must be compounded to a solution once the external layer is removed.[18] Potentially more significant in the HCT and cellular therapy populations are the overlapping toxicities with concomitant medications. CQ and HCQ are associated with QTc prolongation, especially problematic in HCT patients receiving multiple other QTc prolonging agents such as azole antifungals, fluoroquinolones, macrolides (azithromycin), 5-HT3 antagonists, etc.[19,20] Electrocardiograms should be obtained prior to starting antiviral therapy with CQ/HCQ. Early reports of dual therapy with HCQ and azithromycin raise considerable concern for QTc prolongation and warrant discussion of risk versus benefit.[7] Vigilant electrolyte repletion is also recommended as HCT patients commonly have significant electrolyte disturbance further increasing their risk of cardiac arrhythmias. A rare but notable adverse effect seen with both agents is alteration in insulin metabolism leading to hypoglycemic events. Patients with concurrent diabetic therapies should be appropriately monitored closely.[21] Other toxicities noted in drug labeling include elevated liver function tests, ophthalmic changes, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency-related anemia. Ophthalmic toxicities are typically associated with consistent drug concentration of 6.5 mg/kg/day for >5 years[21] and the G6PD-associated toxicity was not observed in a retrospective review of patients receiving HCQ for autoimmune disease.[23] Given the short course and risk/benefit ratio of initiating COVID-19 directed therapy, these potential toxicities are less concerning however G6PD assessment would be ideal.",

It then binds RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, acting as a delayed RNA chain terminator.[26]\n,\n[27] Remdesivir has demonstrated in-vitro and in-vivo activity in animals first against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, and now with potent in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2.[28,29] The current dose being studied is 200 mg IV on day 1, followed by 100 mg IV once daily for 10 days.[30] In the United States, remdesivir is available on clinical trial or via compassionate use; however on March 23, 2020 Gilead Inc. had to temporarily halt use on an individual compassionate basis due to the overwhelming requests.[31] It is still available for pregnant women and children under 18 years of age with severe COVID-19 outside of a clinical trial at this point. Although remdesivir is described as a substrate for CYP2C8, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 in-vitro, it is thought that inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 are unlikely to cause significant drug interactions since remdesivir's metabolism is likely mediated by hydrolase activity.[30], [31], [32]\n",

Creation of separate order sets or treatment defining indications for CAR T-cell CRS vs. COVID-19 CRS could help pharmacy maintain separate stock. HCT pharmacists may also be consulted for their expertise with CRS management in treating COVID-19 patients.",
