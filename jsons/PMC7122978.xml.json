RMSF cases follow a seasonal pattern, with 90% of infections occurring between April and September. Clinical signs and symptoms include fever, myalgias, severe headache, as well as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. A characteristic petechial or maculopapular rash that starts around the wrists and ankles and may involve the palms and soles appears 2\u20135 days after the onset of fever. Less common clinical presentations include myocarditis, pneumonia, acute kidney injury, and neurologic manifestations. RMSF often causes severe illness, with a case fatality rate of 5\u201310%.",

            "text": "The diagnosis of RMSF is based onclinical signs and symptoms in a patient with possible tick exposure. Treatment should not be delayed while awaiting laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis. Laboratory abnormalities include mild hepatic transaminitis, thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, and mild lymphocytic pleocytosis in the CSF [3]. Immunohistochemistry performed on skin biopsy at rash onset may be useful to confirm a diagnosis. RMSF serology typically becomes positive 7\u201310 days after symptom onset. A fourfold increase in serum antibody titers or a convalescent titer >1:64 is diagnostic. There is possible cross-reaction between RMSF titers and other spotted fever group rickettsioses, especially Rickettsia parkeri, which is transmitted by the Gulf Coast tick Amblyomma maculatum, may have an eschar at the site of tick bite and usually causes a mild illness. The treatment of choice for RMSF is oral doxycycline 100 mg twice per day for 5\u20137 days, continuing at least 2\u20133 days after the patient defervesces. Chloramphenicol is an alternative treatment only used in cases of severe doxycycline allergy or during pregnancy if the illness is mild, but chloramphenicol is associated with increased mortality, is also associated with adverse effects, and is ineffective against other severe tick-borne infections in the differential diagnosis, i.e., human granulocytic anaplasmosis and human monocytic ehrlichiosis.",
