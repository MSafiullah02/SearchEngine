To adjust for prefectural population density, we defined the incidence of Covid-19 as the cumulative number of Covid-19 patients divided by the population per 100-km 2 inhabitable area. Random-effects meta-regression was performed, and its graph depicted Covid-19 incidence (plotted as the logarithm transformed incidence on the y-axis) as a function of a given meteorological factor (plotted on the x-axis). A slope of the meta-regression line was significantly negative as a function of the mean air temperature (coefficient, -0.127; P = 0.023), the mean sea level air pressure (coefficient, -0.351; P < 0.001), and the mean daily maximum UV index (coefficient, -0.001; P = 0.012) which indicated that Covid-19 incidence decreased significantly as air temperature, air pressure, and UV increased. In conclusion, higher air temperature, air pressure, and UV may be associated with less Covid-19 incidence.",
