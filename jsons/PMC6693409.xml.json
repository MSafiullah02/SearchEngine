The recent upsurge of measles in Europe is an impressive example. Anti-vaccinationists argue that possible side effects weigh out the benefits (2). Especially sequelaes such as autism, multiple sclerosis (MS) and various neurological syndromes have been emphasized by the anti-vaccination lobby (3, 4). This alarming development is even partly supported by health-care providers including some MS neurologists, who are afraid of iatrogenic deterioration of pre-existing MS. Indeed, studies linking vaccination and disease onset have been published. Although these studies were often underpowered and lacked an adequate design in order to provide evidence of the suspected link, they caught public awareness leading to a drop of public vaccination coverage rates (5, 6).",

Although saving countless lives it was recognized that active sensitization with neuronal tissue could occasionally lead to neuroparalytic autoimmune complications (29) with self-limiting autoimmune encephalomyelitis that fulfilled the pathological criteria of MS (29, 30). Advances in processing techniques and increasing insights in immunology led to modern vaccines devoid of neuronal tissue. MS is a chronic disease thought to be caused by immune-mediated mechanisms. Thus, immune responses caused by vaccinations will affect the immune system. However, their effects on immunology per se, but especially those in MS patients, are scarcely understood.",

Possible structural similarities between microbial epitopes and epitopes of the CNS could lead to cross-reaction of antibodies via molecular mimicry as shown for streptococcal antibodies in heart tissue (31). Additionally, epitope spreading is a mechanism leading to a broadening of the immune response from the dominant epitope to cryptic (intramolecular) or neighboring molecules (intermolecular) resulting in an increased antibody repertoire and cellular response (32). Moreover, bystander activation, a process in which activated APCs stimulate autoreactive T cells, can occur (33). Bacterial and viral infections can trigger relapses and MRI activity in MS; vaccination has been proven to protect from or weaken infections, thus providing an \u201cindirect\u201d protection against MS disease activity (34).",

Immunization against rubella was associated with diffuse myelitis and recurrent relapses with optic neuritis, paraparesis and impaired motor function (39, 40). Transverse myelitis (41) as well as optic neuritis (42, 43) were reported in patients vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella. Further cases with symptoms suggestive for disseminated encephalitis were reported after vaccination against diphtheria-tetanus-poliomyelitis (DTP) (44) and after immunization against smallpox, rabies or typhus (45). Exacerbations of MS and demyelinating lesions were reported in MS patients and patients without a history of neurological conditions after immunization against hepatitis B (46).

While Hernan came to same results for immunization against influenza or tetanus in a case-control study (evidence class II), active immunization against hepatitis B was reported to pose a higher risk for MS (50). The latter finding could, however, not be confirmed by Confavreux in a large case-crossover study. Additionally, no increased risk was seen for vaccination against tetanus and influenza as well (51). Similarly, other class II case-control studies did not report on an increased risk for MS after hepatitis B vaccination (52\u201354). An even decreased risk for MS was reported after tetanus immunization (8). In a large class I study, a patient register including 789,082 females vaccinated with the quadrivalent HPV vaccine was analyzed. Thereof, 4,322 patients with MS and 3,300 patients with other demyelinating disorders were studied and no increased risk for CNS manifestations was seen in this large cohort (55).",

Several cases of ADEM have been reported to be timely related to vaccinations against rabies (69), HPV (70, 71), hepatitis A and B, diphtheria, tetanus and poliovirus (72), measles, rubella and booster immunization for Japanese encephalitis (73). ADEM has been reported following vaccination against influenza, including eight cases after vaccination against H1N1. Also, four ADEM cases after vaccination against YF can be found in literature (74, 75). Besides case reports, there have been some observational studies, albeit all having their limitations. In 26 out of 35 reported cases of ADEM, patients had infections or vaccinations prior to disease onset (76). Also, Pellegrino et al. concluded a possible relation between post-vaccination ADEM in children and adults. Four hundred four cases of ADEM were analyzed based on the data of the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database and the EudraVigilance post-authorization module (EVPM) (77). About 60% of the cases occurred between 2 and 30 days after vaccination, most commonly against influenza and HPV. A case-control study on vaccination against hepatitis B, influenza, polio, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella, Japanese encephalitis, meningitis, hepatitis A, varicella and rabies did not reveal an increased risk for the onset of ADEM in the time spans of 0\u201330 days and 61\u2013180 days after vaccination, but between 31 and 60 days (78).

In some situations, risks and benefits of a live vaccine have to be weighed against each other, e.g., in varicella zoster virus (VZV)-negative MS patients under fingolimod treatment, varicella vaccination may be considered, since severe complications from natural varicella infection may outweigh the risk from this live vaccine. However, recommendations vary between different institutions even within the same country (80, 82, 83). A recent case report on a lethal VZV infection in an immunocompromised patient after VZV live vaccination drives the discussion on this issue (87).",

Importantly, the refractory period after immunosuppression has to be considered as well, which may be up to 1 year depending on the type of medication (e.g., rituximab or alemtuzumab) (81). Vaccines will have various effects on the immune system, which greatly depend on the cell types typically engaged by the respective vaccines. The impact of immunosuppression on the various cell types (and possible mitigation of effects) should be taken into consideration. Protective efficacy is mostly mediated by antibodies for the following vaccines: cholera, diphtheria toxoid, hepatitis A and B, haemophilus influenzae type b, influenza, Japanese encephalitis, meningococcal PS and conjugates, papillomavirus, pneumococcal PS and conjugates, polio (Sabin and Salk), rabies, rotavirus, rubella, tetanus toxoid, typhoid PS, and YF. Effects are solely born by T cells for tuberculosis (BCG), or by a combination of antibodies and T cells for measles and intranasal influenza vaccination. Besides antibody-mediated protection, effects of T cells are discussed for pertussis (9).",

For diphtheria, TBE (with caution), hepatitis A, B, haemophilus influenzae type b, measles, mumps, pneumococcus, polio, rubella, tetanus, rabies and varicella, standards are available and recommended to be tested. In general, to increase the validity of vaccination control, titers should be assessed in paired samples (before and after immunization) via the same method and at high-quality standards (81). In general, patients should have received their recommended standard vaccines according to their region-specific vaccine guidelines. Before certain immunosuppressive treatments are initiated, it is mandatory to exclude former infections and if necessary, vaccination should be considered according to the regulatory agencies. Table 2 provides an overview on necessary vaccinations according to FDA/EMA guidelines (extended vaccination reflects the authors' suggestion). For many immunotherapies, a prior exclusion of an ongoing VZV infection is required and vaccination should be offered to those, who haven't gained any immunity yet. Additionally, VZV-seropositive patients undergoing immunotherapy should be offered vaccination as well to prevent zoster reactivation and late effects. Recently, a non-live subunit vaccine has been authorized for VZV-seropositive patients. It possesses a better risk-benefit profile compared to the live vaccine and has already been approved by many countries (88).",
