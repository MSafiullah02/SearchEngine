High-density living in high-rate urbanization enables cities to utilize resources more efficiently by decreasing traffic cost and other energy usage [3]. However, designing high-density cities should also provide solutions to serious environmental problems caused by congested urban conditions [4].",

Stagnant air in outdoor urban spaces worsens outdoor urban thermal comfort and urban air pollution dispersion. In summer, a decrease in wind speed from 1.0 m/s to 0.3 m/s is equal to 1.9 \u00b0C temperature increase, and outdoor thermal comfort under typical summer conditions requires 1.6 m/s wind speed [5]. Wind data from an urban observatory station of Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) indicate that the mean wind speed at 20 m above the ground level in urban area, Tseung Kwan O, has decreased by about 40%, from 2.5 m/s to 1.5 m/s over the last 10 years [6]. The frequent occurrence of high concentrations of pollutants, such as NO2 and respirable particles (RSP), in urban areas like Mong Kok and Causeway Bay has been reported by The Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department because of poor dispersion [7]. After the outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government strived to improve the local wind environment for better urban living quality. Relevant studies, policies, and technical guidelines, such as Air Ventilation Assessment (AVA) and Sustainable Building Design (SBD) Guidelines (APP-152), have been conducted on the urban planning and design process [8].",

The layer structure of the air flow above the urban areas has been widely discussed [9], [14], [15]. As shown in Fig. 4\n, Oke [9] provided the logarithmic wind profile in a neutral atmosphere, which is a semi-empirical relationship acting as a function of two aerodynamic characteristics, namely, roughness length (z0) and zero-plane displacement height (zd). Grimmond and Oke [11] suggested a physical phenomenon to explain the need for zd in the function. With more and more new roughness elements being added to the surface, the new roughness elements decrease the drag force of those already on the surface because of mutual sheltering. The effective height of the canopy for momentum exchange is reduced. Therefore, to validate the logarithmic wind profile formula in urban areas, a new \u201cground surface\u201d (zero velocity in the wind profile) is set to zd + z0 [16], as shown in Fig. 4. The height of the zero velocity level is found to be about 1.5\u20132 m below the mean height of buildings; below this level, any wind velocity profile is possible [14].",

To comply with the AIJ guidelines, four layers (layer height: 0.5 m) are arranged below the evaluation height (2.25 m above the ground). The maximum grid size ratio is set to 1.2, as shown in Fig. 5.",

The earliest study on wind speed classification is by Beaufort (cited in [41]).

Unlike the abovementioned classifications in which wind is a kind of \u201cnuisance\u201d, the current study considers wind as a benefit. Therefore, this classification is based on the outdoor thermal comfort and not on the wind force on pedestrians or buildings. Ng et al. [43] conducted a survey to obtain the pedestrian-level wind speed threshold values, especially for outdoor thermal comfort in Hong Kong, using physiological equivalent temperature (PET) [44]. In a typical summer day when air temperature is 27.9 \u00b0C and relative humidity is about 80%, wind speed of 0.6\u20131.3 m/s is required to achieve neutral thermal sensation (neutral PET: 28.1 \u00b0C). In another survey on thermal comfort in Hong Kong [5], the wind speed settings with and without wind break are 0.3 m and 1.0 m, respectively, which is equal a 1.9 \u00b0C air temperature difference.",

The randomized cubic buildings prevent input air flow from directly entering into the gaps between two parallel buildings, enabling a more similar simulation results with the wind environment in real urban areas. As shown in Fig. 12, the accelerated wind speed is found at street canyons along with the wind direction. However, other than these areas, wind speed is significantly decelerated, especially in deep street canyons across the wind direction. When the input wind direction is changed from 90\u00b0 to 45\u00b0, air flow can enter into the streets from both directions (Fig. 13). Therefore, areas with stagnant air are decreased. In the input wind direction of 0\u00b0, as shown in Fig. 13, air flow can penetrate more deeply into the streets than those in the prevailing wind direction (90\u00b0). The wind environments in three input wind directions are consistent with the statement in the AVA study: \u201cAn array of main streets, wide main avenues and/or breezeways should be aligned in parallel, or up to 30 degrees to the prevailing wind direction, in order to maximize the penetration of prevailing wind through the district.\u201d [6]\n",

            "text": "Based on the result analysis in Section 5, a number of understandings that are significant to urban planning and design can be stated as following:1)Street grid orientation in grid planning is a significant parameter in urban natural ventilation performance. Main streets should be arranged along the prevailing wind direction. The efficiency of the design issues also depends on the prevailing wind direction, as demonstrated in the results in Section 5.3.2)The mean building height decides the z0 + zd value in high-density urban areas. However, to pedestrians, urban ventilation performance mostly depends on the pedestrian-level building porosity.3)On the whole, decreasing the site coverage ratio helps increase the pedestrian-level natural ventilation performance. Comparison among Cases 3\u20135 provides a more detailed understanding. Wind profiles in Cases 3 and 4 suggest that, in high-density urban areas, building setbacks along the street across the prevailing wind direction (Case 3) are less useful than building separations along the prevailing wind direction (Case 4). On the other hand, the Case 5 (Fig. 18b) profile suggests that, if building separation is incorporated with building setback, the pedestrian-level wind speed on the leeward outdoor space can be further improved.4)Wind permeability in the podium layer is very useful in leading air flow to deep street canyons. In Case 6, the building void between towers and podiums significantly accelerates turbulent flows in the podium layer, and the stepped podiums lead air flow to the pedestrian level. Air flow across the building void (10 m) are numerically presented as red lines in Fig. 18b. The mean wind speed on the leeward outdoor space can be improved to approach the condition in 1903.5)Air passages should be arranged as close as possible to the ground level. Poor wind performance in Case 7 indicate that wind permeability in towers does not improve the pedestrian-level wind environment. On the other hand, compared with the profiles of case 6, it is known that the wind passage in the podium layer should incorporate the stepped podium to benefit the pedestrian-level wind environment, or the openings on the facade should be opened from the ground.6)Building setback, separation, and building permeability are helpful in improving the pedestrian-level wind environment. However, the levels of efficiency of these strategies differ. Natural ventilation performance in urban area results from the integral effects of buildings, therefore, considering the urban area as a whole is important. As such, air paths in the areas can be efficiently established and organized by applying different strategies to improve building porosity. Combining several strategies (urban planning + building design) is recommended because it is usually more efficient than any single strategy. Planners and architects should choose appropriate strategies based on the actual design requirements and insights from this section.7)The current study gives some scientific insights into the urban ventilation section of the Hong Kong Planning Standards and Guidelines (HKPSG) [45], as it stresses the importance to design into the urban plan breezeways and air path with non-building areas and building setbacks from streets. Aligning of the streets properly and leaving sufficient open spaces that can be interlinked are equally important, as well as complimenting the urban planning efforts with building level designs. Building gaps, separations, and porosity close to the pedestrian levels are extremely useful in improving air space for urban air ventilation circulation.8)Increasing urban density has gained attention in recent worldwide discussions. Traditional wisdom attributes the decline of urban air ventilation to increasing urban density because of high urban frontal area density (FAD). This understanding is generally correct, and balancing the need to reduce land resource demand with designing more compact cities is also useful. The current study suggests that more insights should be gained to fine tune and design urban morphologies and building forms that \u201coptimize\u201d urban air ventilation. The optimization process can consider further the bio-meteorological needs of air ventilation in different climatic zones [5].9)Evidence-based decision making is important, especially for market or policy transformation [46], [47]. This understanding is only possible with scientific and parametric studies that examine the sensitivity and performance of various design and planning options. The parameters should be defined carefully and practically to arrive at \u201crealistic\u201d results.\n",

Results of the comparison between CFD simulation results and wind tunnel data suggest that the \u03ba\u2013\u03c9 SST turbulence model is accurate enough to simulate the turbulent flows caused by shape-edged buildings. Unlike the wind field studies in real urban areas, the current study designs a number of parametric models to test the different modification effects on pedestrian-level air flow in street canyons. Compared with other parametric studies in which only one or two buildings are included, this study employs computational modeling in the urban scale to include the effects of the urban context. This study derives a wind speed classification based on the outdoor thermal comfort, as well as uses the relative frequency of the pedestrian-level wind speed and the vertical profiles of the mean wind velocity to evaluate the natural ventilation performance in street canyons. Cross-comparison results suggest that the sensitivity of the wind performance is not same to different modifications of building morphology.
