            "text": "Repeated cycles of infection-associated lower airway inflammation drives the pathogenesis of persistent wheezing disease in children. Tracking these events across a birth cohort during their first five years, we demonstrate that >80% of infectious events indeed involve viral pathogens, but are accompanied by a shift in the nasopharyngeal microbiome (NPM) towards dominance by a small range of pathogenic bacterial genera. Unexpectedly, this change in NPM frequently precedes the appearance of viral pathogens and acute symptoms. In non-sensitized children these events are associated only with \"transient wheeze\" that resolves after age three. In contrast, in children developing early allergic sensitization, they are associated with ensuing development of persistent wheeze, which is the hallmark of the asthma phenotype. This suggests underlying pathogenic interactions between allergic sensitization and antibacterial mechanisms.",

They are a major cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in infants and young children whose immune systems have not yet matured (Ferkol and Schraufnagel, 2014; Zar and Ferkol, 2014) , and are the most common reason for antibiotic use in children (Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care, 2017). The upper airway is a reservoir for microbial communities including viruses, bacteria and fungi, and these have implications for respiratory health and disease. However, current research into the aetiology of ARIs focuses primarily on viruses, most notably respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinoviruses (RV). The bacterial microbiome is increasingly recognised as playing an important role in the susceptibility and severity of ARIs, as well as non-communicable respiratory diseases such as asthma (de Steenhuijsen Piters et al., 2015; Durack et al., 2016; Man et al., 2017; Vissers et al., 2014) . Infancy is a critical time when microbial colonization may influence an individual's future respiratory health or disease; indeed, epidemiological data show that repeated ARIs during early childhood are a major risk factor for wheeze and asthma that persist into adulthood (Holt and Sly, 2012) .",

These independent studies in different human populations have reported strikingly similar findings. Firstly, the NPM appears to be simple in structure, with distinct profiles dominated by a single bacterial operational taxonomic unit (OTU) or genus. A Staphylococcusdominated profile can be observed in early infancy (from one week) but its prevalence decreases sharply over the first year, to be replaced by Corynebacterium, Alloiococcus (Dolosigranulum) or Moraxelladominated profiles, with transient incursions of Streptococcus or Haemophilus-dominated profiles during ARIs. Secondly, NPM composition influences both microbiota stability and ARI risk and severity. One study of 60 infants from Netherlands in the first two years of life reported a Moraxella-dominated or mixed Corynebacterium/Dolosigranulum profile at 1.5 months of age was associated with high NPM stability and low frequency of parent reported ARIs in the subsequent period (Biesbroek et al., 2014) . Our study of 234 infants from Australia in the first year of life also found that Moraxella-dominated and Alloiococcus-dominated profiles were more stable than others, but a Moraxella-dominated NPM at two months of age was associated with earlier onset of first ARI (Teo et al., 2015) . There were also common environmental correlates of the NPM which differed slightly across studies but included mode of delivery, infant feeding, season, crowding or exposure to other children, recent antibiotic use, and prior infections. Many of these studies, however, were limited to samples collected either during illness or during periods of health, and none have yet elucidated the dynamics of the NPM over the entire preschool period.",

In this study, we performed a comprehensive characterization of the largest longitudinal collection of nasopharyngeal samples reported to date -over 3,000 samples from 244 children collected during periods of respiratory health and acute illness over the first five years of life, as part of the prospective Childhood Asthma Study (CAS) (Kusel et al., 2008; Kusel et al., 2006; Kusel et al., 2007; Kusel et al., 2012; Teo et al., 2015) . We have previously reported an association between viral-associated lower respiratory infections (LRIs) in infancy, especially those accompanied by fever, and the development of persistent wheeze and asthma in later childhood at five and ten years of age in this cohort, particularly for infants who developed allergic sensitization by age two (Kusel et al., 2007; Kusel et al., 2012) . In addition, we recently reported patterns of bacterial colonization in samples collected during the first year of life, and found that specific NPM profiles were associated with ARI symptom severity, independent of the effect of common respiratory viruses (Teo et al., 2015) . Here, we address several major research gaps: (i) we examine the relationships and longitudinal dynamics of NPM colonization within children, in health and during ARI episodes, across the first five years of life; (ii) we investigate changes in the association of ARI symptoms with specific NPM taxa over the preschool years; (iii) we address whether the appearance of viral pathogens in the NPM is a harbinger of change in local bacterial populations, or vice versa; and (iv) we investigate the relationship between NPM colonization, early allergic sensitization and future persistent wheeze at five years of age.",

However, these associations were age-dependent and appeared to shift following the increase in within-sample diversity observed from two years of age. Comparing the time periods before year two and on or after the second birthday, a total of 310 OTUs were found to be significantly associated with ARI in at least one interval (absolute difference >1.5-fold and FDR adjusted p-value <0.025; see Figure S4A ). The majority of Moraxella, Haemophilus and Streptococcus OTUs were consistently positively associated with ARI in both time periods. Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium and Alloiococcus OTUs were negatively associated with ARI in the first 2 years, but these associations waned after 2 years, particularly for Corynebacterium and Alloiococcus ( Figure S4A ). Interestingly, we found two Streptococcus OTUs that were negatively associated with ARI (OTUs 4365744 and 509773, which show closest match to species gordonnii and thermophilus / salivarius / vestibularis, respectively; see Table S2 , Figure S2A ).

Correlations were calculated separately for samples collected before two years of age and on or after the second birthday; values for the eight most common OTUs are shown in Figure 4A . Illnessassociated OTUs of Moraxella, Haemophilus, and Streptococcus formed a group that were all positively correlated with one another in both time periods, and negatively correlated with the health-associated Streptococcus OTU 509773 and Staphylococcus ( Figure 4A ). Corynebacterium and Alloiococcus were strongly correlated with one another in both periods (SparCC correlation=0.68, p = 0.001). Surprisingly, the relationship between these OTUs and those in the illness-associated group (Figure 4A ) was complex and changed over time, becoming significantly more positively correlated with age ( Figure 4B ). Corynebacterium and Alloiococcus were positively correlated with Moraxella throughout, with correlation strength increasing significantly over time ( Figure 4A ; Fisher's r to Z transformation comparing Moraxella-Corynebacterium and Moraxella-Alloiococcus correlations before and after 2 years: p = 9 x 10 -14 and p = 7 x 10 -16 respectively). Corynebacterium and Alloiococcus were negatively correlated with the illness-associated Haemophilus and Streptococcus OTUs in early years, but became positively correlated (Streptococcus) or uncorrelated (Haemophilus) in later samples ( Figure 4A -B). We hypothesised the increasing co-occurrence with Moraxella might explain the increasing association of Alloiococcus with ARI symptoms in later years; indeed, adjusting for the abundance of Moraxella OTU 4398454 resulted in attenuation of the positive association of Alloiococcus with ARI after two years, but not the negative association with ARI prior to two years ( Figure S6) . Staphylococcus was positively correlated with the health-associated Streptococcus 509773 (SparCC correlation=0.22, p = 0.001) but negatively correlated with the illness-associated group as well as Corynebacterium and Alloiococcus.",

Overall, the probability of the next consecutive healthy sample sharing the same (non-mixed) MPG as the current sample (i.e. a stable transition) was greater than expected by chance (31% vs 18% for samples collected <6 months apart, binomial test p = 2.3 x 10 -7 ; 23% versus 18% for samples collected 6-12 months apart, p = 0.011), indicating some degree of stability of the microbial communities within individuals over time. This stable transition probability was highest for the Moraxella (45%) and Alloiococcus-Corynebacterium (32%) MPGs, which were the most common states for healthy NPM samples ( Figure 4C ). Where a sample was assigned to the mixed1 MPG, the probability of the next sample also being designated mixed1 was high (30%). However, the composition of such samples can vary widely, and Bray-Curtis distances between consecutive mixed1 MPG samples were close to the distances between distinct MPGs (Figure S8) , indicating that the majority of consecutive pairs assigned to mixed1 MPG represent significant shifts in NPM composition rather than stable transitions. The probability of a stable transition to the next time point was significantly lower at 2 months of age than at 6, 12 18 or 24-month time points (Figure 4D ; 20% vs 31%; Fisher's exact test p = 0.03), consistent with the observation of a distinct NPM profile at 2 months ( Figure 1B) . Transition stability declined after 2 years, and an increasing proportion of transitions involved consecutive samples assigned to the mixed1 MPG ( Figure 4D) , consistent with the observed increase in diversity after age 2 (Figure 2A) . The frequency of persistence of the Staphylococcus MPG dropped after 6 months and increased again in the fourth year, consistent with prior observations that maternally-transferred S. aureus can be detected in infants, but stable colonisation is not established until the pre-school years (Brown et al., 2014; Jimenez-Truque et al., 2012; Schaumburg et al., 2014) . Taken together, these results show the NPM is highly variable in early childhood. Stability of health-associated MPGs was significantly disrupted by the occurrence of LRI during the sampling interval, however antibiotic use did not significantly alter the probability of stable transitions ( Table 1) .",

Here, we investigated whether presence of the illness-associated Moraxella, Streptococcus and Haemophilus MPGs during the first four years of life was predictive of LRI intensity during the same period, and/or wheeze at age five. For each child, we calculated the combined frequency of these MPGs amongst healthy NPM samples over different time periods (Methods). Among children with early allergic sensitization (defined as allergen-specific IgE > 0.35 kU/L by two years of age, see Methods), frequent ARI-associated MPGs (\u226550% of healthy NPM samples) during the first two years of life was significantly positively associated with the number of LRIs experienced in the same period (Table 2) . Importantly, among these early sensitized children, the frequency of illness-associated MPGs in the first two years of life was independently associated with chronic wheeze at five years of age ( Figure 6A) , even after adjusting for LRI frequency and type (Table 3) . Notably, among non-sensitized children, the frequency of illness-associated MPGs was not associated with chronic wheeze at five years but was significantly positively associated with the transient wheeze phenotype (defined as any wheeze in the first three years of life but no wheeze in the fifth year) (Figure 6, Table 3 ).",

We found the NPM from birth to five years of age remains dominated by six common genera (Figure 1) and has yet to converge to an adult-like NPM, which is characterised by much greater alpha diversity, lack of Moraxella and Corynebacterium, and much lower biomass (Stearns et al., 2015) . This is in contrast to the oropharynx (Stearns et al., 2015) , or the gut microbiome, which matures to an adult-like state by three years of age (Yatsunenko et al., 2012) . Consistent with previous observations (Biesbroek et al., 2014), we found a constant level of NPM diversity over the first two years of life, followed by a period of increasing diversity -in terms of both number and equitability of OTUs -for at least three years (Figures 2A, S2) . This increasing diversity coincided with a change in the relationship between the NPM and respiratory disease, whereby negative associations between MPGs and ARI became attenuated (as in the case of Corynebacterium) or changed direction to become positively associated with ARI (Alloiococcus) (Figure 3) . In the latter case, this appears to be driven by an increasing alliance with Moraxella (Figures 4, S6) , which itself was ARIassociated. Moraxella establishes biofilms that enhance the co-survival of pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae (Pearson et al., 2006; Perez et al., 2014) . It is not yet clear whether the negative associations of certain taxa with ARI denote active protective effects, or simply the lack of pathogenic drivers of symptoms; however there is some evidence from murine models that pre-exposure to Corynebacterium can provide some resistance against RSV infection (Kanmani et al., 2017) .",

However there was some stability even between samples collected 6 or 12 months apart ( Figure 4C-D) , especially for the MPGs dominated by Moraxella or Alloiococcus and Corynebacterium, which appear to be stable colonizers of the nasopharynx of children. Notably, stability of the Alloiococcus-Corynebacterium MPG was significantly reduced by LRI episodes, which are typically associated with an influx and/or overgrowth of Moraxella, Streptococcus or Haemophilus that can presumably destabilise the bacterial community. This is consistent with a recent study that reported reduced stability of the NPM during infancy among children who experienced more than two ARIs in the first year of life (Bosch et al., 2017) . Ultimately, more comprehensive description of natural NPM dynamics, including detailed assessment of resilience to exogenous agents, will require higher resolution sampling (weekly or daily) and would also benefit from larger cohorts.",

The relative abundances of these OTUs were significantly correlated with one another ( Figure 4A) ; we hypothesise this is related to the protection provided by the Moraxella biofilm (Tan et al., 2007) , which can release outer membrane surface proteins that protect other bacteria from complement-dependent killing. Other groups have previously reported reduced upper airway microbial diversity during or prior to ARIs (Frank et al., 2010; Santee et al., 2016; Yi et al., 2014) ; our data supports this, both in terms of enrichment of a small number of community profiles (MPGs) during ARI, and a higher abundance of ARI-associated OTUs and lower alpha diversity within these MPGs compared to that observed in the absence of ARI symptoms (Figures 2B, S3 ; Tables S1, S3). We therefore propose that overgrowth of these particular taxa may tip the balance towards respiratory symptomatology, either by direct action as invasive pathogens or via indirect dysregulation of the local immunological milieu. Such dysregulation may increase the likelihood of a primary viral infection of the nasopharyngeal mucosa, or subsequent spread of infection to the lower airways, as suggested in our earlier study on this cohort during infancy (Teo et al., 2015) . This is further supported by the increased prevalence of Moraxella in asymptomatic samples collected 1-2 weeks before an LRI (Figure 5C ). Most LRIs (>80%) had a known respiratory virus present, and this is likely the trigger for acute symptoms. However, the lack of enrichment for viruses, but enrichment for Moraxella, in the 1-2 weeks preceding LRI suggests that having the bacteria present when the virus is encountered increases the likelihood of severe respiratory illness. While our study had insufficient power to detect similar effects for Streptococcus and Haemophilus, due to low colonization frequency in our cohort, there is a large body of evidence accumulating around specific mechanisms of interaction between human respiratory viruses (mainly RV, RSV and influenza) and Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis; including both viral promotion of bacterial colonization and outgrowth (for which we see evidence in the form of increased abundance of pathogenic genera in ARIs), and bacterial promotion of viral receptor expression on host cells (Bosch et al., 2017; Brealey et al., 2015) . While the present study cannot address specific mechanisms, it provides evidence for interactions in both directions, and demonstrates that bacterial colonization influences subsequent ARI throughout infancy and early childhood.",

In early sensitized children, asymptomatic colonization of the upper airways by illness-associated MPGs increased risk of chronic wheeze at five years of age; however, in children who had not developed early allergic sensitization, it was associated only with transient early wheeze, which resolved by the fourth year of life. Furthermore, in the early sensitized children, the frequency of asymptomatic colonization with illnessassociated MPGs was also associated with recurrence of LRIs, particularly those accompanied by fever, throughout the first 4 years of life ( Table 2) . Notably however, whilst frequency of LRI is associated with five-year chronic wheeze (Kusel et al., 2007; Teo et al., 2015) , the effect of bacterial colonization on fiveyear wheeze remained after adjusting for LRI (Table 3) . It has been suggested that the pathogenic bacterial species S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis induce local immunoinflammatory responses in the upper airways of neonates, which in the case of M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae include upregulation of a mix of Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines (Folsgaard et al., 2013) . However, how these immune responses differ between sensitized and non-sensitized children is incompletely understood. We have suggested, based on previous studies in this and other asthma-risk cohorts (Holt & Sly 2012), that the increased severity of these episodes in children with allergic sensitization is due in part to interactions between infection-associated Type 1 IFN-mediated and allergy-associated Th2-mediated inflammatory pathways which compromise their capacity to efficiently clear respiratory pathogens, thus worsening ensuing airway inflammation and resultant immunopathology. Conversely, host immune defense mechanisms in those who are non-sensitized are not compromised by these interactions, and they accordingly experience only transient illnesses.",

In conjunction with early allergic sensitization, the dominating presence of illness-associated MPGs (Streptococcus, Haemophilus, and Moraxella) in the upper airways is a significant risk factor for persistent wheeze in school-age children, which is the hallmark of the asthmatic phenotype. This observation is of potential importance in relation to early detection and prevention of asthma. In particular, sensitized children in this cohort already showed elevated levels of allergen-specific IgE production from six months of age (Holt et al., 2010) , suggesting a high-risk group could be identified in infancy. Airway microbiome monitoring and potentially modification might be beneficial for this high-risk group, in reducing the risk of lower respiratory infection, the repeated occurrence of which is closely linked to asthma development.",

Healthy nasopharyngeal (NP) samples were collected at planned half-yearly visits (first sample from about 2 months of age, subsequently at 6 months, 1 year, and so on), in the absence of any symptoms of acute respiratory illness (ARI) for at least 4 weeks. In addition, parents were to contact a study clinician at the onset of any ARI symptoms, at which point a study nurse visited the family within 48 hours to collect a NP sample from the child and interview the parents on the symptoms and medications used in relation to the illness. ARIs were classified as a lower respiratory illness (LRI) if accompanied by wheeze or rattly chest; or an upper respiratory illness (URI) otherwise. A total of 1943 healthy samples, 2579 URI samples, and 1056 LRI NP samples were collected and divided into aliquots that were cryofrozen for later analysis. Parents kept a daily record of any medication used, from which antibiotic exposure information was extracted, and completed yearly questionnaires during face-to-face interviews. Blood samples were collected from each child at 6 months, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years of age, and positive sensitization status at each timepoint was defined as serum IgE levels > 0.35 kU/L to house dust mite, cat epithelium and dander, peanut, foodmix, couch grass, rye grass, mould mix, or infant phadiatop (details of which were described in (Holt et al., 2010) ).",

DNA extraction, amplification of the V4 rRNA region, and amplicon sequencing via Illumina MiSeq were performed as previously described (Teo et al., 2015) . Paired end reads were merged using Flash version 1.2.7 (Magoc and Salzberg, 2011) with read length 151 base pairs (bp) and expected fragment length 253 bp. The merged reads were quality filtered as follows: \u22643 lowquality bp (Phred quality score < 3) allowed before truncating a read, \u2265189 consecutive high-quality bp, sequences with any N characters were discarded. Reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using the closed reference OTU picking method in QIIME v1.7 using the Greengenes 99% reference database version 13_05. Mean of 1% of reads per sample had no match to the Greengenes database and were excluded from further analysis (except for alpha diversity calculations, as described below). Negative control samples had a median of >1500 (taxonomy-assigned) reads (interquartile rage 900 -2300), while NP samples had a median of >147K reads (IQR 45K -230K). We therefore removed 142 NP samples with <3000 taxonomy-assigned reads, and also 226 healthy samples that did not fulfil the criterion of >4 weeks after an illness episode, leaving 3014 samples (1018 healthy samples and 1996 ARI samples) for further analysis. Because entries in the Greengenes database may be identical in the V4 subregion that we sequenced, it is possible for identical read sequences to be assigned to different Greengenes OTUs. We therefore merged counts for OTUs that were identical in the sequenced V4 region (identified by extracting the sequence between the forward and reverse primer sequences), as shown in Figure S2 . Read counts were corrected for OTU-specific copy number using Picrust v1.0 (Langille et al., 2013) using the pre-computed copy number estimates for Greengenes OTUs version 13_05; and relative abundances were calculated by normalising to the total taxonomy-assigned reads for each sample. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted by BLAST searching the NCBI 16S rRNA database using representative V4 region sequences from the common taxa ( Figure S1B) to identify similar sequences. For each genus, the sequences were aligned using Muscle and a maximum-likelihood tree constructed using PhyML ( Figure S2) ; these were used to identify the closest known species for each common OTU (Table S2) .",

Next, the closed reference OTU picking was applied on the filtered sequences. All sequences that did not match a reference at the closed reference step were then de novo clustered at 97% similarity. Singleton OTUs (i.e. sequences observed only once across the whole dataset) were discarded. Samples were rarefied to 3000 reads prior to diversity calculations; rarefaction was performed 10 times, and we report the mean Shannon diversity index for the 10 independent runs for each sample.",

SparCC uses a log ratio transformation and calculates correlations between OTUs in an iterative manner, under the assumption of a sparse network. Statistical significance of the correlation was assessed using 1000 bootstrap samples with exact p-value calculations based on the permp function in R package statmod (Phipson and Smyth, 2010) . Correlation networks were generated across all samples, as well as separately for samples before and after 2 years of age, samples within each half yearly time periods, and samples with low abundance (<1%) of Moraxella OTU. We assessed differences in correlation before and after two years using the Fisher's r-to-Z transformation (cocor R package).",
