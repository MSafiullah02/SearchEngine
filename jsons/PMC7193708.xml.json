            "text": "Nucleic acids have been conventionally extracted by one or a combination of the following methods:Extraction with phenol and phenol/chloroform mixtures for purification of DNA and RNA. Proteins and restriction enzymes are removed by phenol and chloroform in disrupting protein secondary structure causing proteins to denature and precipitate from solution. Although each of these solvents is capable of performing this function alone, the two materials together remove proteins from solution much more effectively. Nucleic acids are recovered in the liquid phase.Nucleic acids are released by means of strongly denaturing and reducing agents, including hydrolytic enzymes (e.g. protease, lysozyme, lyticase), from cells and tissues and subsequently extracted and purified with a mixture of chloroform and phenol. The nucleic acids are finally obtained from the aqueous phase by ethanol precipitation or narrowing down by means of dialysis [63] or capturing via silicon resins or magnetic particles.Proteinase K1/phenol method, in which a proteolytic enzyme such as proteinase K or a surfactant is added to disrupt the cell membrane or wall and the protein of a complex of interest is degraded to free nucleic acids; then phenol/chloroform are added and the mixture is centrifuged to have the nucleic acids transferred into the aqueous phase; the aqueous phase is recovered by separation and ethanol, isopropanol or the like is added to the recovered aqueous phase, thereby rendering the nucleic acids insoluble [63].The AGPC method, in which a liquid mixture of guanidinium isothiocyanate and phenol is added to a sample of interest to disrupt the cell membrane and wall, so that the protein of the complex is denatured to become soluble; nucleic acids are then freed and chloroform is added to transfer the nucleic acids to the aqueous phase; the aqueous phase is recovered by separation and thereafter, ethanol, isopropanol or the like is added to the recovered aqueous phase, thereby rendering the nucleic acids insoluble [15]. This method often uses a proprietary formulation of this reagent called Trizol (TRIzol is a chemical solution used in RNA/DNA/protein extraction and is the brand name of the product from Invitrogen).The guanidinium method, in which guanidinium hydrochloride or guanidinium thiocyanate is added to a sample of interest to disrupt the cell membrane and wall, so that the protein of the complex is denatured to become soluble and to remove dissolved impurities; nucleic acids are then freed and ethanol or isopropanol is added to render the free nucleic acids insoluble. Elution of any bound nucleic acids from the supporting material is with water or low-salt buffers such as 10 mmol/l Tris or TE (10 mmol/l Tris, 1 mmol/l EDTA). An advantage of this method is that chaotropic salts ensure the irreversible denaturing and thus inactivation of nucleases. Essential disadvantages of the method are that the concentration of the chaotropic salts to some extent have to be strongly adjusted to the material used, and also the lysis of biological material, such as fungal or plant tissue, is sometimes only very inefficient (these may require initial protease inclusion to dissolve these thicker cell walls). If enzymes (proteinase, RNase) are used in the purification methods, the concentration of chaotropic agents must be reduced below values which otherwise bring about inactivation of nucleases [15, 63].The sodium iodide method, in which sodium iodide containing glycogen which has affinity for the nucleic acid to be extracted is added to a sample of interest, whereby the cell membrane and wall are disrupted and the protein of the complex is denatured, so that it becomes soluble; nucleic acids are then freed and isopropanol is added to render the free nucleic acids and glycogen insoluble [32].\n",

An advantage of such a commercially available method is that nucleic acids can be extracted even from materials with very small nucleic acid content with a universal protocol. A disadvantage is that the nucleic acid preparations may not meet high quality standards (including photometric measurement-absorption ratios of less than 1.70 at 260 nm to 280 nm) and this may increase the potential of inhibition within the PCR reaction. It is possible that PCR inhibitors (heme protein, anionic surfactants, cationic surfactants, non-ionic surfactants and zwitterionic surfactants) can sometimes interfere with subsequent PCR amplification. These inhibitors may therefore be present in the extraction solution or obtained as part of the extraction process from the biological sample or from some other source. The presence of PCR inhibitors in the extraction solution would result in little or no amplification of nucleic acids and this would be deemed to constitute absence of effective extraction from the sample. That is where the inclusion in the PCR of some form of internal control is of importance and why standards push for their inclusion.",

These systems may use magnetic particle-based extraction (the majority of high through-put systems) or silica resin based extraction systems. These systems may extract up to 96 samples per run but some use more plastic disposables than others and some may be used coupled with a liquid handling system for higher throughput of PCR testing. This then also becomes a budgetary decision.",

It is still used in some laboratories and for specific assays fully evaluated for the use of such a procedure. However it is the potential existence of other factors within the sample itself which may inhibit the actual PCR method used. This may be cellular or histone proteins, lipids, cell wall components or heme proteins derived from blood which has been shown to be inhibitory to some PCR methods. This inhibition is most often seen with the extraction of DNA from faecal samples. The extraction of the more labile RNA from stools also requires methods more suitable to extraction, stability and avoidance of inhibition. Some commercial kits have been designed with inhibitor removal buffers or tablets for these specific applications.",

These can eliminate the time-consuming and labor-intensive deproteinisation, organic extraction, dialysis, and alcohol precipitation protocols required in traditional DNA purification procedures. Additionally, in many instances, they can replace robotic extraction procedures and save valuable time:Bio-Rad Laboratories has a 20 ml Chelex-based resin solution for PCR-ready DNA purification from blood, cultured cells, or bacteria. The procedure is rapid: incubate sample with InstaGene\u00ae matrix at 56\u00b0C for 15\u201330 min, then boil for 8 min. and microcentrifuge for 2 min to pellet the resin. DNA in the supernatant is ready for PCR. InstaGene\u00ae matrix is made with a specially formulated 6% w/v Chelex resin and it makes DNA sample preparation fast, easy, and cost-effective. The Chelex matrix binds to PCR inhibitors and adsorbs cell lysis products rather than DNA, preventing DNA loss due to irreversible DNA binding and produces an improved substrate for PCR amplification.\nhttp://www.bio-rad.com/prd/en/US/adirect/biorad?cmd=BRCatgProductDetail&productID=111001\nApplied Biosystems has a 20 ml PrepMan\u00ae Ultra Preparation reagent and is applicable for a variety of different sample preparation applications. It has been used successfully to prepare DNA template from bacteria, yeast, filamentous fungi, both from a plate or from tissue smears, human cells (buccal swab), mammalian whole blood and from Gram-negative food-borne pathogens for use in PCR amplification reactions. Using a simple boil and spin protocol, PrepMan\u00aeUltra Reagent efficiently inactivates PCR inhibitors and significantly reduces the need to repeat the template preparation step. PrepMan\u00aeUltra Reagent is a novel formulation, developed entirely at Applied Biosystems, and is a homogeneous solution that does not contain Chelex or any other type of resin or matrix. It is based on ethyl glycol monobutyl ether with hydroxylated organoamine. The protocol is rapid and easy: resuspend the sample in 200 \u03bcl PrepMan\u00ae Ultra reagent or add the sample directly to 200 \u03bcl PrepMan\u00ae Ultra reagent, boil for 10 min, cool for 2 min, microcentrifuge for 2 min, transfer 5 \u03bcl of the supernatant to the assay.https://products.appliedbiosystems.com/ab/en/US/adirect/ab?cmd=catNavigate2&catID=602362&tab=OverviewEPICENTRE Biotechnologies has a range of rapid extraction procedures depending on sample type and \u201ctarget\u201d of extraction \u2013 be it DNA or RNA. http://www.epibio.com/main.asp\n\n",
