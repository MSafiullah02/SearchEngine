Such events of reconnection and secondary contact of previously isolated populations are widely observed at different time scales. For example, during the quaternary glaciation, sea water level fluctuations caused temporal isolation of populations, often to be followed by secondary contact. At shorter time scales, population isolation and reconnection of viruses are commonly observed, and such events are often associated with epidemics and pandemics. Here, using coalescent theory and simulations, we describe the temporal impact of population reconnection after isolation on nucleotide differences and the site frequency spectrum, as well as common summary statistics of DNA variation. We identify robust genomic signatures of population reconnection after isolation. We utilize our development to infer the recent evolutionary history of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) in Asia and South America, successfully retrieving the successive HIV subtype colonization events in these regions. Our analysis reveals that divergent HIV-1 subtype populations are currently admixing in these regions, suggesting that HIV-1 may be undergoing a process of homogenization, contrary to popular belief.",

For example, a population bottleneck increases the variance of coalescence times and reduces the number of variants at low frequency in the site frequency spectrum (SFS) (Tajima 1989) . Population expansion creates star-shaped genealogies and increases the mean number of variants at low frequency in the SFS (Tajima 1989; Slatkin 1996) . Population sub-division leads to long internal branches in the genealogy and increases the number of fixed variants (Harpending et al. 1998 ). It also results in \"structured\" genealogies in which the means and variances of coalescence times (e.g., time to the most recent common ancestor) are large, resulting in an excess of intermediate frequency variants in the SFS (Wakeley 1999) . Balancing selection leads to a similar structure, and to an excess of variants at intermediate frequency (Tajima 1989; Fay and Wu 2000; Barton and Etheridge 2004; Zeng et al. 2006) . Directional selection leads to genealogies with both star shapes (leading to the common ancestor of the selected lineages) and long branches (due to remaining ancestral lineages and/or recombination with the selected haplotype), and generates an excess of variants at both low and high frequency (Barton 1998) .",

            "text": "Consequently, DNA sequence polymorphisms are increasingly used to infer past demographic events and have successfully reconstructed past histories of many organisms, including humans (Gravel et al. 2011; Reich et al. 2012) . Some of the first methods proposed were developed to infer population growth rates (Slatkin and Hudson 1991) or for specific demographic scenarios (e.g., Nielsen and Wakeley 2001 ; Hey diverged populations after isolation remains difficult, as models of past isolation with recent contact are challenging to distinguish from models of ancient population separation with a continuous exchange of migrants. Also, parameter inference requires a priori knowledge of a population split (Hey 2010) , and the time at which migration event(s) occurred has thus far been difficult to estimate (Sousa et al. 2011; Strasburg and Rieseberg 2011) . Nielsen and Wakeley (2001) first proposed a method to infer time of divergence (IM model), the migration rate between the two populations, as well as the relative sizes of the populations. This approach was extended to account for the divergence of multiple populations (Hey 2010) and temporal reduction of gene flow following an initial population split (Wilkinson-Herbots 2012). Though others have discussed the expected signature of a reconnection event following a past isolation period (Becquet and Przeworski 2009; Sousa and Hey 2013) , detailed theoretical formalization is still lacking. Besides this, the use of the aforementioned methods for general inference is also challenging as they are difficult to apply when the number of sampled populations is large (Beaumont et al. 2002; Drummond et al. 2005; Gutenkunst et al. 2009; Lohse et al. 2011; Excoffier et al. 2013) , and when multiple sampled time-points are available (Excoffier et al. 2013; Foll et al. 2014) . Further, they often rely on a specific evolutionary model, such as the Wright-Fisher model (e.g., Gutenkunst et al. 2009; Lohse et al. 2011; Excoffier et al. 2013 ) which might not be representative of, for example, the skewed offspring distributions found for marine species or viruses (Tellier and Lemaire 2014) Past population isolation and subsequent reconnection or secondary contact are common in natural populations and can have a drastic impact on species' evolutionary histories. Anatomically, modern humans are thought to have admixed with Neanderthal populations after a period of isolation between the African and European continents (Green et al. 2010; Patterson et al. 2012; Sankararaman et al. 2012) . Similarly, African and non-African populations of Drosophila melanogaster also experienced a period of isolation, followed by subsequent admixture (Pool et al. 2012) . Domesticated species of both plants and animals are isolated from their wild relatives, and often experience subsequent genetic exchange (e.g., in crops; Ellstrand et al. 1999) . Importantly, isolation and subsequent reconnection events are also common features in viral histories, including the Influenza A virus, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV; Renzette et al. 2013) , where dependency on the host cell and other features of the life cycle isolate viral populations within hosts, groups of hosts, or host species inbetween infections. For example, reassortment between avian and human influenza viruses caused the pandemic outbreaks in 1957 and 1968, and a reassortment of swine, avian and human influenza viruses was responsible for the 2009 pandemic (Hsieh et al. 2006; Garten et al. 2009; Flahault and Zylberman 2010) .",

            "text": "As in influenza, events of HIV isolation and reconnection are common and can be observed at different spatial and temporal scales. Indeed, tracing the origin of HIV has confirmed that cross-species transmission of SIVs from other primates to humans, acting as sources of HIV, occurred several times over the past 100 years (Li\u00e9geois et al. 2014) . The virus remained isolated for a very long period and adapted rapidly in humans, which ultimately rose to epidemic levels (Korber et al. 2001; Tebit and Arts 2011) . Circulating HIV populations in humans are strongly divergent. Two major types of HIV exist (HIV-1 and HIV-2) and both have diversified into several groups or subtypes (Robertson et al. 2000) . The HIV pandemic is mainly caused by HIV-1 Group M, which is composed by divergent (up to 35% sequence divergence) subtypes (named A-D, F-H, J, and K, Gaschen et al. 2002) . The HIV epidemic is associated with the worldwide movements of people that allowed HIV-1 subtype colonization events (Tebit and Arts 2011; Hamelaar et al. 2011) . In the course of their evolution in human populations, HIV-1 subtypes experienced several large-scale isolation events within both transmission risk groups (Su et al. 2000; Pang et al. 2012; Han et al. 2013; Li et al. 2013 ) and countries (Bello et al. 2011; Castro-Nallar et al. 2012) . Subsequent reconnection then occurred through coinfection, superinfection, and recombination (Tebit and Arts 2011; Vuilleumier and Bonhoeffer 2015) . Those reconnection events are the source of emergence of many new recombinant forms which constitute a major challenge for vaccine development and are at the origin of new epidemics (Tebit and Arts 2011; Feng et al. 2013) . The multiple colonization events of HIV-1 that occurred in Asia and in South America are representative of this trend (Hamelaar et al. 2011) . Indeed, with an estimated 4.8 million people living with HIV as of 2011, Asia is the second most HIV-affected region worldwide (Zhang et al. 2013) . Historical epidemics in Asia are associated with transmission events to various risk groups; HIV-1 subtypes B and C were first detected in the mid-1980s and early 1990s, respectively, in the Injecting Drug Users (IDUs) risk group (Lu et al. 2008) , and then spread to other populations. Subtype CRF01_AE was first detected in the Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) risk group in the 1990s, then spread to other groups and became the most prevalent HIV-1 subtype in many parts of China. Similarly, the epidemic clade circulating in South America is derived from subtype B viruses that migrated out of Haiti around 1969 Haiti around (1966 Haiti around -1972 and spread through the world (Bello et al. 2011) . Later, a single-founder subtype F1 strain, introduced in Brazil, spread and recombined with local subtype B viruses to form the HIV-1 BF1 and F1 epidemics (Aulicino et al. 2007) .",

The scaled migration rate M between populations (i.e., twice the number of migrant genes per population per generation) is the same before and after the isolation period and mutations follow a Poisson process of rate u=2 (Kimura 1969) . We used an infinite sites model for the analytical investigations, and for the simulations we considered a finite sites model with a number of sites corresponding to HIV-1 genome size (9719bp, from the reference HXB1 sequence). Our developments are based on the Wright-Fisher model (Fisher 1930; Wright 1931) , where each population has a constant size N. For analytical simplicity, we considered that times T iso and T reco are scaled in units of N generations, so T iso \u00bc 1 corresponds to an isolation event that occurred N generations ago. We derived an exact theoretical formula for the distribution of pairwise nucleotide differences in nonrecombining genomic regions (Appendix A), and simulated this distribution using coalescent simulations (software ms; Hudson 2002) in the case of recombining regions. We computed the power to sample sequences from each mode of the distribution using equations A.6a-A.6b (Supporting Information, Figure A in File S1).",

To account for repeated bottlenecks (e.g., during transmission events), extinction-recolonization dynamics, and rapid adaptation, we simulated the distribution of pairwise nucleotide differences under a scenario of reconnection of isolated populations under a beta-coalescent model. Beta-coalescent models have recently been proposed to model the genealogies of many organisms with a large variance in the number of offspring per individual (Birkner and Blath 2008; Tellier and Lemaire 2014) , in particular viruses (Neher and Hallatschek 2013) . We extended the algorithm from Birkner and Blath (Birkner and Blath 2008)which generates samples under a beta-coalescent at equilibriumto include an island model of migration (each lineage migrates to another population at rate M) and an isolation period. We assumed that coalescence processes follow the beta-coalescent at all times: before isolation, during isolation and after reconnection. In addition to mutation and migration rates, beta-coalescents rely on a parameter a (0 # a # 2) that gives the probability of multiple lineages coalescing at the same time. We present the results for four different parameter values: a \u00bc 0 (equivalent to the classic Kingman coalescent), a \u00bc 0:5, a \u00bc 1 [corresponding to the Bolthausen-Sznitman coalescent, used to model strong positive selection (e.g., Neher and Hallatschek 2013)], and a \u00bc 1:5.",

Gaussian distributions are used to estimate positions of the mode as distributions are symmetric (the 5% and 95% quantiles of the skewness of all components are -1.05 and 1.05, respectively). The algorithm also provides posterior probabilities of membership into modes, which is used to identify genomes that have bimodal distribution (i.e., indicating admixture).

Bimodality was observed in these distributions (both within and between populations, p w and p b ) only when a population reconnection occurred ( Figure 1A ). This bimodality reflects the different possible origins of the two sequences sampled: the two sequences either have a recent common ancestor (i.e., after the reconnection event; first mode in Figure 1A ) or an ancient common ancestor (before the isolation event; second mode in Figure 1A ). Bimodality was also observed in the distributions of total pairwise nucleotide difference (considering all populations, p) after a reconnection event but, in this case, bimodality was also observed when populations were completely isolated (T reco \u00bc 0, Figure 1 , B and C). To differentiate a connection from an isolation event, bimodality needs to be associated with a temporal increase of the variance of the modes in the distribution (which depends on the recombination rate; see Figure 1 ).

Power to detect bimodality, with high probability (95%) ( Figure A in File S1), depends on the sample size, the duration of the reconnection period, and the amount of gene flow among populations (scaled migration rate). As shown in Figure A in File S1, it is easier to detect a reconnection event from the distribution of pairwise nucleotide differences between populations than within populations. Indeed, the second mode in the distribution of pairwise nucleotide differences was larger between population (p b ) than that of within population (p w , Figure  1A ). This difference in mode size increases when migration is weak or intermediate (M # 1) and the reconnection event is not recent ( Figure A in File S1). Ancient reconnection events can be detected even with small sample sizes (n\u224310) when migration is moderate or strong (M $ 1; Figure A in File S1).

Consistent with the expectation, we found a large excess of variants at intermediate frequencies on the SFS following reconnection events between previously isolated populations ( Figure 2 ). This excess was due to exchanges of variants among populations that were once fixed in one or several populations during isolation. The size and the position of this excess is indicative of the number of populations that have reconnected and of the timing of the reconnection event (Figure 2A) , and can be identified by the visual test of equilibrium neutrality proposed by Nawa and Tajima (2008) . We predict that in the total SFS (SFS obtained with merged samples from all populations), shortly after a reconnection event one would expect narrow, high peaks of specific variants. These peaks are found at frequencies i=d, where d is the number of sampled populations and 1 # i , d, when populations have equal sample sizes. In Figure 2A , peaks can be seen at frequencies 1=d and 2=d (d \u00bc 3). With unbalanced sample sizes, the number of observed peaks can be higher (up to 2 d 2 2 peaks; see Figure B in File S1).",

Subtype J is used as an outgroup (see Figure K in File S1, results for alternative outgroups). Original subtypes (subtypes found early in the epidemics in Africa; at the corners) are used to define a triangle in the PCA space. The position of the HIV-1 genomes on the straight edges of the triangle suggests strong admixture between subtypes. For the total and joint SFS, we consider the mean value of 500 random samples of sequences in each subtypes cluster (see Figure J in File S1 for the different clusters). A sample of 16 sequences per subtype cluster is considered in China, and of eight sequences per subtype cluster in South America. The significance of the trends in the dynamics is tested using the optimal test statistic T V derived in the SI ( Figure L in File S1).",

Such events modify the expected signature only by presenting an excess of low frequency variants compared to what is expected with populations of constant size (as expected from the results of Tajima (Tajima 1989 ) in a single panmictic population). Replacing the classic Kingman coalescent model (Wright-Fisher model) with a beta-coalescent model does not alter our results for values of the model parameter a (Figure H in File S1). Beta-coalescent models account for large variance in the number of offspring per individual, as expected under repeated bottlenecks, fast extinction-recolonization dynamics, or recurrent beneficial fixations (Neher and Hallatschek 2013; Tellier and Lemaire 2014) . Such variance leads to an excess of low frequency variants and smaller peaks in the total SFS compared to Kingman's coalescent model; this effect is larger for small a values (light-gray lines Figure H in File S1). However, having an excess of variants at low frequency does not alter the identified signature of reconnection on the total SFS (dynamics of the peaks). Also the temporal dynamics of the signature distinguish this pattern from that of an IM model. Indeed under the IM model, the size of the peaks in the SFS increases with time ( Figure I .B in File S1), whereas the signature of a reconnection of isolated populations is characterized by a decrease in peak size with time ( Figure 2A) .",

We found that a large proportion of the genome of HIV-1 displays bimodality (Figure 4 ). In China, this proportion was initially low but rapidly increased through time. Between 2006 and 2007, the proportion of bimodality increased fourfold (Figure 4) , and increased a further 40% between 2008 and 2009. This suggests that the time series analyzed here captures a burst of HIV-1 subtype admixture. The dynamics of genomic admixture between HIV-1 subtypes in China is also highlighted by the temporal changes in the distribution of pairwise nucleotide differences and the SFS. The peaks formed by the excess variants (resulting from population admixture in the total SFS) decreased in size, and the values of optimal test statistics T V significantly decreased ( Figure L in File S1). We find a significant increase in the variance of the first mode in the distribution of pairwise nucleotide differences between 2005 and 2009 (p , 0:01 two-sided Bartlett test). The joint SFSs for the two time points also indicate that the reconnection event and genome admixture is either recent or that genome admixture is limited but ongoing. Indeed, we can observe the excess of variants along the axes of the joint SFS shifting to the diagonal (Figure 3, C and D) . In South America, the proportion of bimodality in HIV-1 samples from 1999 is large (60%) and remains approximately Table B in File S1) and South America (see Table B in File S1). As expected under genomic admixture (Figure 1 ), the proportion of bimodality detected in the pairwise nucleotide differences between populations in HIV-1 genomes increased, and the variance of modes significantly increased with time in China (p , 0:01, two-sided Bartlett test) .

Consistent with the observations for Chinese and South American samples, we observed that HIV-1 genomes are positioned on the straight edges of the triangle formed by original subtypes, positioned at the corners, forming a continuum along the axes rather than discrete clusters within. Very few genomes are localized outside the edges of the triangle defined by the 3 original subtypes. This pattern not only signals that most of the circulating HIV-1 genomes experience constant gene flow from other subtypes but also represents the current spatial distribution of HIV-1 populations.

Our theoretical investigations identify specific genomic signatures of past population isolation. We show, for example, that the number, size, and dynamics of modes in the distributions of the pairwise nucleotide differences in populations are informative on the existence of past isolation. Our results extend previous work on the distribution of pairwise coalescence times and pairwise nucleotide differences under a model of population split with or without migration (IM model). We show, for example, that under the reconnection model, the distribution of pairwise nucleotide differences has a temporal evolution which is distinct from the one expected under an IM model (Takahata 1995; Wakeley 1996; Rosenberg and Feldman 2002) : the distribution is first bimodal and then tends to become unimodal with time. We also found that in the Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS), the presence, the position and the value variants in excess are informative as to the numbers of previously isolated populations, and the joint SFS characterizes the amount of genetic overlap between populations. Signatures identified here are robust to the presence of recombination, extinctioncolonization processes, population bottlenecks, and expansion as well as skewed offspring distributions. Our developments add to the current literature in the field as we demonstrate that population reconnection after isolation is not fully captured by commonly used test statistics based on SFS classes of variants at high and/or low frequencies such as D, H, and E (Ferretti et al. 2010) . Taken together, this provides critical information on the evolution of the genomic composition of populations.",

In both regions, we reconstruct the successive colonization of HIV-1 subtypes, and find that they are followed by strong HIV-1 subtype admixture. We find, in these regions, that HIV diversification is followed by a temporal homogenization of HIV-1 genome composition. Our analysis highlights a large degree of admixture between circulating HIV-1 subtype genomes in China and South America, and most probably worldwide. These results suggest that genomic exchanges may indeed be relatively strong, and that HIV-1 is currently in a process of homogenization subsequent to isolation and diversification. HIV genome homogenization may seem to contradict the idea that HIV is undergoing a diversification process (Hamelaar et al. 2011; Tebit and Arts 2011; Feng et al. 2013) . However, this homogenization is consistent with observed diversity in the HIV-1 population and the increased number of new HIV recombinant forms described worldwide (Hamelaar et al. 2011; Tebit and Arts 2011; Feng et al. 2013) . Indeed, when isolated and diverged populations reconnect, a transient excess of genetic diversity is predicted in the resulting population (Alcala et al. 2013; Alcala and Figure 5 Projection of worldwide distributed HIV-1 sequences from subtypes B, C, CRF01_AE and F1, and URF and CRF recombinant forms between these subtypes. 1646 genome sequences (see Table A Vuilleumier 2014) as all the genetic material that accumulated during the isolation phase is shared among populations. However, this excess of genetic diversity is transient and with time, the diversity decreases (Alcala et al. 2013) . In HIV-1, such processes occur through multiple recombination events among subtypes through coinfection or superinfection and are the source of novel recombinant forms. In the long term, successive recombination events will ultimately lead to the homogenization of the genomic composition of HIV-1. Homogenization might be further enhanced by selective forces imposed by the immune response or treatment acting on the HIV genome (Fellay et al. 2007; Pelak et al. 2011; Chikata et al. 2014) . As many world regions are currently being newly colonized by different HIV-1 subtypes, it is expected that new recombinants may still emerge and HIV diversity will further increase. However, as demonstrated here, this is expected to be a transient state toward global homogenization.",

To confirm this, we identified the genome sequences that signal the reconnection event. As expected, they reflect first the HIV outbreak in China in 1989: colonization of B and C subtypes (variance of the first peak in the SFS is generated by B and C subtypes). The subsequent colonization of CRF01_AE at the origin of the HIV outbreak in the late 1990s is also signaled in the SFS (a high proportion of CRF01_AE in the highest mode). We obtained similar concordance for the origin of the sequences forming the peaks and the successive subtypes' colonization events in South America.",

It is also under strong selective pressure from the immune system (e.g., Snoeck et al. 2011 ) and undergoes frequent bottlenecks followed by population expansion [during transmission (e.g., Keele et al. 2008) ]. Nevertheless, the signature observed here in the distributions of pairwise nucleotide difference and on SFS only slightly deviates from theoretical expectations. The robustness of these results may have a simple explanation: a separation of time-scales of the processes involved. Selection and population demographic changes drive divergence of populations during isolation. Migration and recombination during population reconnection allows a rapidrelative to divergencegenome admixture. Both impact genome polymorphism, but the latter does so more drastically and at much shorter time-scales.",

These events are common features of pathogens (Karlsson et al. 2014 ), but also occur in numerous other species, including humans and domesticated plants and animals (Ellstrand et al. 1999; Lecis et al. 2006; Caicedo et al. 2007; Green et al. 2010; Patterson et al. 2012 ). Reconnection following a period of isolation is increasingly recognized as an effective mechanism to trigger fast and complex adaptation (Seehausen 2002 (Seehausen , 2004 Aguil\u00e9e et al. 2013) . Following reconnection, accumulated diversity (from previously isolated populations) is shared, and the resulting high level of genetic diversity may increase the potential for adaptation (Alcala and Vuilleumier 2014) . Admixture among divergent populations may also promote complex adaptation by bringing together new functions acquired in different environments that have evolved independently but are compatible with the genome. Such processes have been observed in influenza and in HIV, for example. Indeed, recombination between strains previously isolated in their nonhuman hosts preceded the HIV epidemic in humans (Bailes et al. 2003; Sharp and Hahn 2010; Vuilleumier and Bonhoeffer 2015) . Such events are expected to be more frequent in the future due to the increase in human mobility (Karlsson et al. 2014) . Finally, our analytical framework could also be applied to evolutionary trajectories of other zoonotic viruses, such as Ebola virus, coronaviruses, hantaviruses, or henipaviruses.",

This has been demonstrated for HIV (Schnell et al. 2011; Buz\u00f3n et al. 2011) as well as human cytomegalovirus (Renzette et al. 2011 (Renzette et al. , 2013 (Renzette et al. , 2014 (Renzette et al. , 2015 .

These coalescence times T w and T b correspond to the time to the most recent common ancestor of two lineages sampled in the same and in different populations, respectively, scaled by the number of genes per population N.The coalescence of two genes under the finite island model can be described by a three states continuous time Markov chain (Notohara 1990 ): the two genes can be present (1) in the same population, (2) in different populations or (3) be coalesced. The transition probabilities from one state to another depend on the scaled migration rate M between populations and on the number of populations d. Time T is counted in units of N generations. The corresponding Markov chain can be summarized by the following transition rate matrix (Notohara 1990) :The probability that two genes were in state (1), (2) or (3) T generations ago (row vector P T ), given that they are in state (1), (2) or (3) at the current generation is given by P T \u00bc P 0 e QT (P 0 at generation 0), where e QT is a 3 \u00b7 3 matrix. The elements of matrix e QT are denoted q i;j \u00f0T\u00de and represent the probability that a gene in state i at the current generation was in state j T generations ago (cumulative distribution function). Thus, the probability distribution (or probability density function) of within-population and between-population pairwise coalescence times are given by the derivatives of corresponding q i;j \u00f0T\u00de functions: f w;coal \u00f0T\u00de \u00bc d dT q 1;3 \u00f0T\u00de and f b;coal \u00f0T\u00de \u00bc d dT q 2;3 \u00f0T\u00de. Populations are considered isolated when T reco , T , T iso and no migration occurs, with M \u00bc 0 in the transition matrix Q. Populations exchange migrants when T , T reco and T . T iso , thus M . 0 in the transition matrix Q. Consequently, the distributions of within-and between-population pairwise coalescence times, f Tw \u00f0T\u00de and f Tb \u00f0T\u00de, following a past isolation event, are:T , T reco q 2;1 \u00f0T reco \u00dee 2\u00f0T2Treco\u00de ; T reco , T , T iso q 2;1 \u00f0T reco \u00dee 2\u00f0Tiso2Treco\u00de f w;coal \u00f0T 2 T iso \u00de \u00feq 2;2 \u00f0T reco \u00def b;coal \u00f0T 2 T iso \u00de; T iso , T:These distributions have a simple interpretation. In the most recent period, the reconnection period, when T , T reco , f Tw \u00f0T\u00de and f T b \u00f0T\u00de correspond to the probability of coalescence of 2 lineages under the finite island model, f w;coal \u00f0T\u00de and f b;coal \u00f0T\u00de. During the past isolation period, T reco , T , T iso , two lineages can only coalesce if they are in the same population after T reco generations of connection (probabilities q 1;1 \u00f0T reco \u00de and q 2;1 \u00f0T reco \u00de within-and between-populations, respectively). Their probability of coalescence at generation T in an isolated population is e 2\u00f0T2Treco\u00de . During the older connection period, T . T iso , two genes can coalesce if they were in the same population during isolation (probabilities q 1;1 \u00f0T reco \u00de and q 2;1 \u00f0T reco \u00de, within-and between-populations, respectively) and if they did not coalesce during isolation (probability e 2\u00f0Tiso2Treco\u00de ). Their probability of coalescence at generation T is f w;coal \u00f0T 2 T iso \u00de. Alternatively, they could have coalesced if they were in different populations during isolation (probabilities q 1;2 \u00f0T reco \u00de and q 2;2 \u00f0T reco \u00de). Their probability of coalescence at generation T isFunctions f w;coal \u00f0T\u00de, f b;coal \u00f0T\u00de, q 1;1 \u00f0T\u00de, q 1;2 \u00f0T\u00de, q 2;1 \u00f0T\u00de and q 2;2 \u00f0T\u00de all depend on the eigenvalues of matrix Q,We obtain:(A.3b) l 2 2 l 1 , A w;2 \u00bc 2 \u00f01 \u00fe l 1 \u00de l 2 2 l 1 , A b;1 \u00bc l 2 l 2 2 l 1 , A b;2 \u00bc 2 l 1 l 2 2 l 1 and B \u00bc M l 2 2 l 1 .Derivation of the distribution of pairwise nucleotide differences: From equations A.2a and A.2b, we can derive the distributions of within-(p w ) and between-population pairwise nucleotide differences (p b ). Given that mutations follow a Poisson process of mean u, we havewhere k is a positive integer and G is the length of the sequence (under the infinite size model, we assume that G is much larger than the number of segregating site). We can decompose P\u00f0p w \u00bc k\u00de into a sum of smaller integrals (respectively for P\u00f0p b \u00bc k\u00de): , we obtain:The resulting distributions of pairwise nucleotide differences (from equation A.5) are presented in Figure 1A . Further assuming that T iso 2 T reco . 3 (thus e 2Tiso\u00feTreco \u22430) leads to: (resp. p b ) under the finite island model at equilibrium, while terms 1 2 e \u00f0li2u\u00deTreco P k j\u00bc0 T l reco \u00f02li\u00feu\u00de l l! are due to the truncation of the distribution between T reco and infinity. The second term corresponds to sequences that coalesce during the isolation period. Indeed, with probability q 1;1 \u00f0T reco \u00de (resp. q 2;1 \u00f0T reco \u00de), sequences did not coalesce during the reconnection period and were in the same population during isolation; u k \u00f01\u00feu\u00de k\u00fe1 correspond to the distribution of p w in an isolated population, and the term e 2uTreco P k l\u00bc0 T l reco \u00f01\u00feu\u00de l l! is due to the truncation between 0 and T reco . Finally, the third term corresponds to sequences that coalesce during the prior connection period. With probability q 1;2 \u00f0T reco \u00de (resp. q 2;2 \u00f0T reco \u00de), sequences coalesce during the prior connection period (as they did not coalesce during the reconnection period and were in different populations during isolation). Then,\u00c1k\u00fe1 corresponds to the distribution of p b under the finite island model at equilibrium, while terms e 2uTiso P k j\u00bc0 T l iso \u00f02li\u00feu\u00de l l! are due to the truncation of the distribution between 0 and T iso .Derivation of the power to detect bimodality: We can derive the power to detect bimodality from the distributions of p w and p b by computing the probability that, in a sample of n independent pairwise differences sequences, at least one is from the first mode and at least one is from the second. Given that the probability for a difference p w to be drawn from the second mode of the distribution is q 1;2 \u00f0T reco \u00de, the probability that among n differences, at least one is from the first mode and one from the second mode is 1 2 q 1;2 \u00f0T reco \u00de n 2 \u00f012q 1;2 \u00f0T reco \u00de\u00de n . Similarly, the probability to observe a bimodal distribution of p b from a sample of size n is 1 2 q 2;2 \u00f0T reco \u00de n 2 \u00f012q 2;2 \u00f0T reco \u00de\u00de n . These results are used to draw Figure A in File S1. Note that with n sequences, we can only compute n 2 1 independent pairwise differences, although the total number of pairwise differences we can compute is n\u00f0n 2 1\u00de",
