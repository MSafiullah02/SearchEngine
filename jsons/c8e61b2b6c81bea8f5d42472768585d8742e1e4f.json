We present a method in which the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is converted into a library of peptide antigen-Major Histocompatibility Complexes (pMHCs) as single chain trimers that contain the peptide antigen, the MHC HLA allele subunit, and the \u03b2-2 microglobulin subunit. This library is used to detect the evolution of virus-specific T cell populations in four COVID-19 study participants two of which share one HLA allele, and the other two a second HLA allele, at two time points over the initial course of infection. HLA-matched participants exhibit similar virusspecific T cell populations, but very different time-trajectories of those populations. This strategy can be used to track those virus-specific T cell populations over the course of an infection, thus providing deep insight into the SARS-CoV-2 immune system trajectories observed in different COVID-19 patients.",

            "text": "In December 2019, an outbreak of unexplained pneumonia was recognized to be associated with an open market in Wuhan, China and reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) by mid-January. The causative agent of the disease outbreak, termed COVID-19, was noted to be a novel coronavirus. 1 Clinical features include fever, cough and dyspnea with a proportion of persons progressing to viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. 2,3 A high mortality rate was noted in persons requiring mechanical ventilation. 4, 5 A larger case-series of >70,000 participants from the CDC China reported that the majority of cases (81%) were mild, with 14% requiring hospitalization, 5% requiring intensive care and an associated 2.3% proportional mortality. 6 The case fatality rate is estimated at between 1% and 5%, but varies with age and comorbidities. Elderly individuals are particularly at risk, with the China experience demonstrating 8% mortality in persons aged 70 -79, and 15% in those aged 80 or older. 6 Little is known about specifics of host T cell defense responses against SARS-CoV-2, although it has been reported that the severity of the COVID-19 infection correlates with a depletion in both CD4 + and CD8 + T cell populations, as well as an upregulation of exhaustion markers in those remaining T cells. 7 One important step towards tracking down the root causes of such immune dysfunction is to identify those T cell populations that are specifically activated by exposure to SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Here we describe a set of measurements in which we identify CD8 + T cell antigens arising from the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as presented by the most common HLA Class I allele A*02:01. Antigen-specific T cell populations were identified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from serial draws from two COVID-19 study participants. Similar antigen-specific T cell populations, but very different time-dependent population evolutions, were observed in the two participants.",

These matched reasonably well with published lists of putative antigens. [10] [11] [12] We then utilized standard plasmid cloning techniques, followed by mammalian cell transfection and expression, to build a library of soluble, secreted peptide-major histocompatibility complexes (pMHCs), in which each library element is a single chain trimer (SCT) that contains the peptide antigen covalently linked to the \u03b2-2 microglobulin subunit linked to the HLA subunit (Fig. 1A) . [13] [14] [15] [16] These SCT libraries can be biotinylated and incorporated into standard pMHC tetramer scaffolds. The SCT tetramers can then be assembled onto the surface of magnetic nanoparticles (to form pNP libraries) for hemocytometry fluorescence microscopy assays (Fig. 1B) , similar to our previous reports, 17, 18 or they can be used for standard flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell-sorting (FACS) assays (Fig. 1C) . For the analysis of COVID-19 participant samples, the pNP libraries have the advantage that all analysis is done in solution, thus avoiding potential risks from aerosolized COVID-19 participant biospecimens.",

            "text": "Our approach to pMHC SCT library synthesis utilized mammalian protein expression systems, as previously reported for individual pMHC constructs. 19 The application of the platform for library assembly of a diverse set of antigens greatly extends the utility of these reagents. In order to validate our library approach, we first expressed a small SCT library consisting of bacterial and viral antigens (Supplementary Table S2 ) bound to the MHC by a cysteine-modified glycine linker (Fig. S1A ). [20] [21] [22] The transfection experiment to produce these SCTs was performed in triplicate, to demonstrate that SCT protein yield was highly variable in a consistent, antigen-dependent manner (Fig. S1B ). Unique to the SCT platform is the expression of pMHCs containing N-linked glycosylated peptides, as evidenced by the increased mass of the library element KLIANNTRV (Fig.  S1A ). To validate the functionality of SCTs, we expressed an SCT that incorporates an immunogenic peptide derived from human cytomegalovirus hCMV-pp65 protein (NLVPMVATV) for use in antigen-specific T cell capture and analysis (Fig. S1 ). For A*02:01 haplotype participants with pre-exposure to CMV, T cell populations with specificity to this antigen are readily detected. We compared antigen-specific T cell capture using this CMV SCT construct and its folded pMHC counterpart as a positive control. Flow cytometry results (Fig. 1C) indicated similar efficiencies of cell labeling from both reagents when applied to a healthy A*02:01 donor sample with known reactivity to the CMV epitope. The FACS-sorted cells were sequenced using 10X T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing technologies, demonstrating that the spectrum and frequency of antigenspecific clones captured by the two reagents are similar. As seen in the table in Figure 1D , Levenshtein distances (LD) of the CDR3\u03b1 and CDR3\u03b2 chains against a public database (VDJdb) were low, indicating high similarity between our detected CMV-specific TCR chains and those previously reported. 23 Two paired clones (red and light orange wedges in the pie graphs of Fig.  1D ) contained CDR3\u03b1 chains that exactly match those found in the literature (LD = 0). 24, 25 An additional clone (light green wedge) contained an \u03b1/\u03b2 pair for which both chains have been reported as specific to the CMV antigen, 24, 26 and was captured by the SCT pMHC variant at a 10fold higher frequency than by the folded pMHC. These data gave us confidence that the SCT platform could be used to present a library of putative SAR-CoV-2 antigens for antigen-specific T cell capture. We further assessed previously published cysteine linker SCT designs and an intra-pocket mutation (H74L) to identify an optimal SCT variant that would bind to T cells with cognate TCRs (Fig. S2A and S2B ). 21, 27 In addition, disulfide bonds designed to stabilize \u03b11 and \u03b12 helices of the HLA peptide binding pocket [28] [29] [30] (Y84C and A139C) were incorporated to generate a new disulfide SCT (DS-SCT) template. Flow cytometry assays were performed in which six SCT mutants containing the A*02:01 Wilms Tumor 1 (WT1) antigen (RMFPNAPYL) were used to target T cells transduced with the cognate C4 TCR (Fig. S2C ). 31 WT1 DS-SCT tetramers displayed the best performance against the WT1-specific C4 TCR, capturing up to 94% of the total cell population (Fig. S2D ). This design was implemented as the standard template for spike protein derived SCTs. for full dataset). Note, for example, that #'s 2, 5, and 12-14 are strongly expressed, but that there are variable degrees of expression for most SCT epitopes. The majority of the SCT epitopes with little or no expression (for example #3 and #9) can be traced to similar regions of the protein, such as the hydrophobic transmembrane region near the C-terminus ( Fig. 2A) . Out of 96 attempted SCTs, 60 yielded usable product, of which we tested the top 30 (ranked by relative SCT epitope expression). A comparison of the relative expression yield for each SCT demonstrated no relationship with predicted binding affinity ( Fig. 2C & S3B ). Peptide 9-mers and 10-mers were more likely to result in expressed SCT epitopes, but the relationship with yield was non-significant (Fig. S3C ). The full list of putative antigens and their relative expression yields as SCTs is provided in Supplementary Table S1.",

CD8 + T cell populations specific to these antigens were still observed at T2, but with an average 3-fold drop in frequency. For participant InCov002 at the T1 time point, CD8 + T cell analysis shows that five of the six populations seen in participant InCov005 were detected above 1-2 counts per 10 4 cells, although at slightly lower frequencies relative to participant InCov005. Vertical dashed lines on the graph show these shared responses between the participants. The kinetic trend for participant InCov002 is opposite that of participant InCov005. At the later time point, the five populations exhibited an approximately 2-fold increase. Notably, T cells specific to the RBD, FP, and CH/S2 derived antigens are detected in the healthy donor, but at 10-20-fold lower frequencies than in the COVID-19 participants. This is consistent with published reports that similar haplotype healthy donors can exhibit measurable, but low frequencies of antigen-specific CD8 + T cell populations relative to what is seen in diseased individuals. 35 It may also imply a level of genetic encoding of the T cell responses shared among similar haplotype individuals. Additional HLAmatched control participants will need to be investigated to resolve this.",

From these 60, only the 30 most highly expressed SCTs were tested. While these SCTs broadly sampled the range of predicted antigen-MHC affinities, the majority of T cells detected were specific to antigens characterized by a binding affinity stronger than 100 nM (Fig. S6) . Thus, it is likely that a thorough search would reveal additional immunogenic antigens. A second bias is in the A*02:01 allele, which does not permit sampling of certain parts of the spike protein, such as the S1/S2 cleavage domain. That domain does yield putative antigens that are sampled by other HLA alleles, and next steps will be to create additional SCT libraries for different HLA alleles. One possibility is that the different immunogenic epitopes of the spike protein confer differing levels of immune protection, based upon factors such as epitope-dependent genetic stability. Understanding the scope of immunodominant epitopes across common and rare HLA haplotypes will be important to understand population response to peptide vaccines.",

In parallel, the SCT monomer library was added to SAC-DNA at a 4:1 ratio to form the SCT tetramer-DNA. To generate fluorescent pNPs, equimolar amounts (in terms of DNA ratio) of NP-DNA and pMHC tetramer-DNA were hybridized at 37\u00b0C for 20 min, along with 0.25 \u03bcl of 100 \u03bcM ssDNA bound to AlexaFluor 750, AlexaFluor 488, or Cy5 (IDT-DNA), and washed once with buffer (0.1% BSA, 2 mM MgCl 2 PBS).

The construction and demonstration of single-chain trimer libraries for antigen-specific T cell capture and analysis. A. Process flow for SCT library development. A list of peptide candidates are converted into DNA oligonucleotides for cloning into a plasmid template. The SCT plasmid library is transfected into HEK293 mammalian cells for 4-day incubation and protein expression. Expression of WT1 (RMFPNAPYL) SCT is shown in SDS-PAGE reducing conditions (right). SN, supernatant from transfection; P, HisTag-purified SCT. Numbers on gel denote kDA mass of protein ladder bands. Expressed SCTs are biotinylated for assembly into pMHC tetramers which are then either assembled onto fluorophore-labeled nanoparticles to make a pNP library (B) or used as fluorophore-labeled tetramers for flow cytometry type assays (C). B. Use of an SCT-based pNP library to capture antigen-specific T cell populations, with measurements done on a hemocytometer chip using fluorescence microscopy. The data shown are from a 4-color analysis of PBMCs containing MART-1 specific CD8 + T cells spiked in as a positive control. A second color is used for a live cell stain, while the 3 rd and 4 th colors are for two SCT library elements. The cells, when surrounded by a single color pNP, appear as fluorescent donut-shaped structures in the micrograph. C. Comparison of a CMV antigenpresenting SCT library element and the analogous pMHC structure prepared via refolding of the separate components. The flow cytometry assays show a similar labeling efficiency for both the SCT and the folded pMHC. D. TCR CDR3\u03b1/\u03b2 gene sequencing analysis of CMV-specific T cells captured by SCT and folded pMHC. Pie charts reveal similar clonotypes captured using both reagents. The light green clonotype (offset wedge in both charts and indicated by arrow for folded pMHC) is seen at higher frequency using the SCT tetramer, and corresponds to published CMV-specific CDR3\u03b1 and CDR3\u03b2 chains. Table (right) contains CDR3\u03b1 and CDR3\u03b2 sequences of the twelve most frequently captured clonotypes from SCT tetramer along with their Levenshtein distance to publicly reported CMV-specific clonotypes from VDJdb. 23 .
