The inhaled air is neither sterile nor free of particles/macromolecules, and it potentially contains pathogens as well as allergens. Accordingly, the respiratory system has developed several safety mechanisms (e.g. mucus production by goblet cells, secretion of a plethora of antimicrobials, mucociliary transport by ciliated epithelial cells, coughing, etc.), which all together protect the body from harmful intruders at the alveolar\u2013air interface [1]. Besides immune cells homing to this important organ, the cells lining the airways, that is airway epithelial cells, significantly contribute to host defence by expressing, amongst several other classes of antimicrobials, a multitude of pattern recognition receptors (PRR), which enables them to quickly respond to dangerous cues.",

            "text": "In the literature, PRRs are classically described as cytoplasmic (nucleotide\u2010binding oligomerization domain\u2010like receptors/retinoic acid\u2010inducible gene\u2010like receptors) or cell surface expressed (i.e. C\u2010type lectin\u2010like receptors and Toll\u2010like receptors) receptors. Less well known is the role of soluble pattern recognition receptors (sPRRs), which represent a group of several other evolutionarily ancient but secreted molecules. Soluble PRRs are key players of the humoral arm of innate immunity [2, 3]. Under physiological conditions, these molecules are expressed constitutively at low levels in the liver by hepatocytes [4] and by a variety of immune cells, but their production rapidly increases in response to pathogens, initiating innate immune responses that modulate mucosal immunity in extracellular compartments such as the bronchial and alveolar airspace [2, 5, 6]. Notably, in the respiratory tract of mice and men, airway epithelial cells (AECs) are a major source of sPRRs (Fig. 1) and protect this barrier tissue from potential injuries (Table 1). Moreover, cells of the macrophage lineage [7] but also T cells, monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs) and granulocytes contribute to protection of the respiratory tract, by locally secreting sPPRs [8, 9] (Table 1). Soluble PRRs share the capacity to bind various microbial and environmental proteins and eliminate them through common mechanisms including agglutination, neutralization, opsonization followed by phagocytosis, with some of them having the capacity to activate complement [10, 11, 12]. As such, sPRRs possess antibody\u2010like features and might, in fact, represent their functional ancestors [13]. In addition, they also interact with and regulate the function of membrane\u2010bound PRRs, which cooperate at the level of the recognition of environmental patterns and the regulation of inflammation [12]. Accordingly, innate humoral immune responses at the respiratory mucosa are shaped by the presence of (i) sPRR with the ability to activate complement, that is, the pentraxins PTX3, CRP; the collectin mannose\u2010binding lectin (MBL); the ficolins ficolin\u20102 and \u20103; (ii) sPRR unable to activate complement (SAA) and (iii) complement components themselves (C3).",

Airway mucosal inflammation in response to foreign antigens is an essential effector arm of innate host defence; however, the involvement of sPRRs in the regulation of the intensity and persistence of airway inflammation remains poorly understood. For instance, some of these sPRR, such as the collectin MBL [17] and the pentraxin PTX3, seem to inhibit, while others, like complement [18, 19], appear to aggravate infectious lung diseases triggered by deadly coronaviruses well known to induce severe acute respiratory syndrome and middle east respiratory syndrome [20].",

PTX3 exists as a homo\u2010oligomer formed by eight identical, covalently linked subunits [44]. Protein oligomerization seems to be essential for PTX3 activity as other oligomeric forms of PTX3 have decreased functionality [45]. In addition, PTX3 function can be regulated by elastase and Aspergillus fumigatus proteases [46]. This indicates that PTX3 is capable to serve pleiotropic functions depending on its oligomeric and proteolytic state. As a sPRR, PTX3 has opsonic activity with a nonredundant protective role against selected pathogens, such as fungi, bacteria and viruses [2, 10, 13, 47]. PTX3 binds with high affinity to the outer membrane protein A from Klebsiella pneumoniae (KpOmpA) but does not interact with cellular receptors that bind this bacterial molecule. PTX3\u2212/\u2212 mice show reduced local inflammation in response to KpOmpA, indicating that PTX3 might amplify KpOmpA\u2010induced responses [48].",

            "text": "Most recently, PTX3 was shown to be a critical positive regulator for inflammatory responses during pneumococcal pneumonia [49]. While PTX3 deficiency renders mice more susceptible to pulmonary aspergillosis due to a defective recognition of conidia by antigen presenting cells and an inappropriate induction of an adaptive type 2 response [50], administration of exogenous PTX3 is able to rescue antifungal resistance early in infection [51]. Similarly, transgenic overexpression of PTX3 is responsible for resistance to viruses (e.g. influenza virus, cytomegalovirus), pathogenic (e.g. Neisseria meningitidis) and opportunistic (e.g. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria, including preclinical models of bacterial sepsis induced by cecal ligation puncture [52, 53, 54]. PTX3 also takes part in extracellular matrix formation [45, 47] and interacts with recognition molecules of the classical and lectin complement pathway, Fc\u03b3 receptor, fibroblast growth factor 2 and P\u2010selectin [10, 50, 55, 56]. A number of clinical studies have pointed to the important role of PTX3 in lung and bone marrow transplant recipients [57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62]. In fact, patients with elevated pretransplant PTX3 plasma levels are more likely to suffer from ischemia reperfusion injury leading to primary graft dysfunction after lung transplantation [57, 58, 59]. In contrast, genetic deficiency of PTX3 predisposes to invasive lung aspergillosis in patients who underwent bone marrow transplantation [61]. Elevated bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) PTX3 levels might be indicative of invasive aspergillosis in lung transplant patients [62] and represent a more reliable biomarker than determination of galactomannan, which gives a high rate of false positive results [60]. Moreover, serum PTX3 levels were found to be higher in patients with lung cancer as compared to cancer\u2010free heavy smokers [63]. In the airways, several innate immune cells have been found to produce PTX3 locally including macrophages, DCs [64] and neutrophils that store and secrete PTX3 as part of neutrophil extracellular traps [65], highlighting its critical role in the humoral arm of innate immunity. Besides infiltrating inflammatory cells, also structural cells, particularly bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells [66, 67] and smooth muscle cells, are main sites of PTX3 expression, which is absent in resting and activated T or B lymphocytes and NK cells [41, 68, 69].",

            "text": "In human patients, PTX3 levels in BALF and sputum significantly correlate with disease severity [21, 22] and have been associated with allergic asthma in adults [14, 21, 22, 41, 70] and children [14]. Moreover, patients with allergic asthma show significantly higher PTX3 expression in airway smooth muscle cells as compared to healthy donors [41]. PTX3 enhances smooth muscle cell eotaxin\u20101 release, which contributes to eosinophilic airway inflammation and airway remodelling [41]. In children, a positive correlation was identified between high sputum PTX3 levels and decreased pulmonary function. Similarly, significant positive correlations were identified between PTX3 sputum concentrations and eosinophil counts in sputum and blood as well as total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels [22]. These findings have been confirmed recently in an independent study in a group of over 100 children with allergic asthma [71]. Notably, there is also a role for PTX3 in children with allergic rhinitis [37]. Children monosensitized to seasonal or perennial allergens and those with allergic rhinitis presented higher PTX3 plasma levels which also correlated with symptom severity [37]. Interestingly, the human PTX3 gene is located on chromosome 3q24\u201328 [42], a region associated with sensitization to Der p 1, a major allergen from house dust mites, and total serum IgE levels in humans [72]. A connection between PTX3 and type 2 immune responses was also established in an experimental model of ovalbumin\u2010induced allergic asthma in mice [21]. PTX3\u2010deficient mice exhibited enhanced type 2 inflammation in the lungs after ovalbumin sensitization and challenge with increased airway hyperresponsiveness, mucus plugging of the airways as well as BALF and lung eosinophilia [21]. The allergic phenotype was associated with a Th17\u2010dominant inflammatory response with an enhanced recruitment of granulocytes, particularly eosinophils and neutrophils, and increased IgE/IgG2a secretion [21]. Mechanistically, the Th17\u2010dominant allergic response in these mice was supported by the Th17\u2010polarizing cytokines IL\u20106 and IL\u201023 from DCs [21]. In summary, serum PTX3 levels might be a valuable marker to demonstrate the presence of low\u2010grade inflammation in asthma [71]. However, serum PTX3 levels seem to be inadequate as marker for asthma management, and it remains a matter of debate whether PTX3 might be directly involved in the etiology of allergic airway inflammation.",

By contrast, interferon \u03b1 significantly inhibits IL\u20106\u2010induced CRP expression in hepatocytes [83], explaining why viral infections cause only modest elevations of CRP. Notably, the small molecule hypolipidemic drug Gemcabene not only lowers cholesterol but also CRP levels alone and synergistically with statins [84], and this is accomplished by interference with C/EBP\u2010delta and NF\u2010kB [85]. Once translated, monomeric CRP (mCRP; 21 kDa) assembles to pentamers in human plasma, which, in fact, might be in equilibrium with a decamer form under physiological conditions [86]. Mechanistically, CRP has homologous regions found in immunoglobins G (IgGs) and can therefore bind to Fc\u03b3RI and Fc\u03b3RIIa but also activate the complement cascade via C1q [87]. Moreover, an interesting dissociation mechanism has been described for pentameric CRP in the presence of bioactive lipids recently, suggesting that pentameric CRP which gives rise to mCRP [88, 89, 90, 91]. mCRP, formed on the surface of activated platelets, shows increased inflammatory properties and is rarely found in circulation, suggesting its predominant role in local inflammation that likely serves as a contributing factor atherosclerotic plaque formation [92]. However, mCRP also mitigates distinct immune reactions, for example, when bound to neutrophils via the Fc\u03b3RIII, mCRP was shown to inhibit fMLP\u2010triggered chemotaxis [93], while aggregated CRP appeared to enhance reactive oxygen species production in response to aggregated IgG but not other stimuli, such as phorbol myristate acetate or opsonized zymosan [94]. Moreover, by recruiting factor H, mCRP also seems to be involved in blunting C3b activity, thereby contributing to the safe removal of opsonized bodily material [95].",

Indeed, elevated serum CRP levels have been correlated with decreased pulmonary function and increased sputum eosinophilic cationic protein levels and eosinophil numbers in steroid na\u00efve asthma patients [34, 35, 39, 98, 99, 101, 102]. These studies were the first to indicate an association of systemic inflammation with airway inflammation. Similarly, studies in Danish school children as well as cohorts of U.S. children and adolescents reported that increased CRP levels were significantly associated with allergic sensitization and an elevated risk of concomitant allergic airway inflammation (rhinitis, asthma), however, independently of allergen type or clinical allergy symptoms [103, 104]. Yet, CRP cannot be used as a predictive biomarker in allergy as no associations were observed between CRP levels at 6 months of age with later development of allergic diseases [104]. Therefore, it was concluded that the low\u2010grade inflammation seen in children with allergic sensitization may be host intrinsic and part of a systemic inflammatory disorder rather than an isolated type 2 immune response or indirectly linked to sensitization through shared environmental risk factors (diet, microbiome) [104].",

Indeed, MBL protects from infections and prolongs life expectancy in patients with congenital lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, in which low MBL levels reduce life expectancy by 8 years [121]. The disease\u2010modifying role of MBL2 has been also correlated with the frequency of respiratory infection\u2010associated hospital admissions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients [122], implicating a putative beneficial role for MBL replacement therapy in this disease entity [123]. Paradoxically, a recently performed long\u2010term follow\u2010up study showed that MBL\u2010deficient COPD patients had more polymorphic microbiota and less risk for infectious exacerbations when compared to patients with fully functional MBL. This was attributed to the fact that no oxidized and thus no macrophage\u2010inhibitory MBL could be formed in the collective of MBL\u2010deficient patients studied [124]. Hence, lung MBL can be regarded a double\u2010edged sword in situations of chronic inflammation, since oxidized forms of MBL might interfere with MBL\u2010oligomer formation and thus clearance of distinct microorganisms [125]",

Target cell bound MBL is recognized by calreticulin (the cC1qR), which is associated with CD91 (the \u03b12 macroglobulin receptor), an endocytic receptor expressed on many cell types (hepatocytes, neurons, fibroblasts) including blood monocytes [127]. While the role of calreticulin for the uptake of MBL immune complexes is undisputed, some reports question a firm association of endocytosing calreticulin with CD91 [128]. This might indicate that other cell surface receptors are involved in calreticulin\u2010dependent endocytosis and thus require a redefinition of the clearance pathway for MBL bound. Intriguingly, the high frequency of MBL deficiency, amounting to 5% in the general population, represents a constant matter of debate, since only a selective advantage is able to establish such a high degree of \u2018deficiency\u2019 for a single protein playing otherwise an important role in humans. One could speculate that MBL deficiency potentially protects from autoimmunity, because in the absence of MBL the likelihood that the immune system becomes primed against constituents of apoptotic cell bodies or serum components is much lower [129]. Moreover, the absence of MBL might protect from intracellular parasitism/infections, since MBL might favour infection with mycobacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae) [111]. However, also the exact opposite has been hypothesized, by showing that coincubation of T cells with MBL inhibits T cell activation, while the absence of functional MBL has been implicated to promote T cell driven autoimmune processes such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis [130].",

Similar to C1q, SP\u2010A proteins form a bouquet\u2010like structure [139]. Within the alveolar compartment, SP\u2010A is tightly associated with phospholipids. SP\u2010A opsonizes Staphylococcus aureus but also Herpes simplex particles for uptake by alveolar macrophages [140, 141]. In contrast, SP\u2010D obtains a cruciform structure, which links its trimeric subunits [142]. In addition, SP\u2010D also exists as a nonlipid bound free form, especially in alveoli. Apart from saccharides, SP\u2010D also binds to phosphatidyl\u2010inositol and glucosylceramide [143, 144, 145]. SP\u2010D plays an important role in the microbicidal activity within the alveolar space, since it opsonizes a number of Gram\u2010negative bacteria including Escherichia coli, activates the respiratory burst in alveolar macrophages [146] and leads to uptake of E. coli particles by DCs followed by T cell activation [147].",

Although primarily functioning as opsonins, orchestrating the phagocytosis of fungi, ficolins also contribute to the activation of the lectin pathway by interacting and activating the MBL\u2010associated serine proteases [163] and trigger the production of inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide by macrophages [164].",

Notably, the latter can be also produced and secreted by bronchial and alveolar type II epithelial cells [167]. Ficolin\u20103 becomes increasingly produced by AEC upon systemic challenge with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) [168]. In addition, a membrane\u2010bound ficolin, M\u2010ficolin, for which binding to Escherichia coli has been described [169], is primarily expressed on monocytes [170]. While there is clear\u2010cut binding of ficolin\u20103 to Aspergillus fumigatus conidia, its binding affinity is much lower than that of serum\u2010derived ficolin\u20102. Moreover, low ficolin\u20102 serum levels identify patients suffering from common variable immunodeficiency who are at risk to develop bronchiectases, a serious life\u2010shortening sequela of the disease [171]. Ficolin\u20103 bound to sialylated glycans scavenges influenza A virus, which leads to the block of infectivity and hemagglutination activity of influenza A virus and its complement mediated destruction [172]. Ficolin\u20103 deficiency due to mutations at position 1637 of the gene (1637delC) leads to immunodeficiency with recurrent lower respiratory infections, septicemia and warts [173], which can even lead to sudden death due to acute meningitis [174]. Interestingly, individuals heterozygous for the 1637delC mutation present with lower serum ficolin\u20103 concentrations [175]. Moreover, ficolin\u20103 has been shown to be responsible for the removal of late apoptotic cells [176]. This salient function might also be one of the reasons why ficolin\u20103 is also a prominent target for autoantibodies (with DNA and other factors acting as adjuvant). Of note, anti\u2010ficolin\u20103 antibodies are frequently (in one third) observed in systemic lupus erythematosus patients and currently have the strongest association of all autoantibodies with active lupus nephritis [177].",

More recently, SAA1 was found to directly bind LPS to form a complex that promotes LPS clearance by macrophages, which offers partial protection against LPS\u2010induced inflammation and acute lung injury [186]. In addition, SAA proteins can bind and transport retinol during bacterial infection [187], thereby restricting their optimal growth and expansion. Moreover, mice lacking Saa3 express lower levels of retinoic acid receptors than their wild\u2010type littermates, which inhibits their ability to respond to retinoic acid and may lead to an incapacity to develop immune tolerance [188]. In humans, there are three SAA proteins that are encoded by the inducible genes, SAA1 and SAA2, and the SAA4 gene that is constitutively expressed [180, 189]. SAA3, which is a pseudogene in humans, encodes an additional inducible form of SAA in mice with high structural similarities to other SAA proteins [180, 189]. Locally produced, lipid\u2010free SAA1 can act through a number of potential SAA receptors [190] and has pleiotropic effects on the immune system including the recruitment of immune cells [191, 192, 193], epithelial wound repair [194] and proinflammatory cytokine production [185, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200]. Considering the dramatic increase in SAA levels at sites of inflammation, the biological activities of SAA1 need to be tightly controlled, for example, by factors present in specific tissue microenvironments or by the ability of SAA1 to adopt different oligomeric states [187, 201, 202, 203, 204]. The structure of SAA, however, is different from chemokines and cytokines, and SAA seems to require ligand\u2010induced activation, which is not observed under physiological conditions [186, 205, 206]. For example, binding to plasma high\u2010density lipoprotein abrogates the cytokine\u2010like activities of SAA proteins [206].",

One such study analysed a fraction of the SARP\u20103 study population (i.e. adult participants suffering from severe and nonsevere asthma), an NIH\u2010sponsored multisite cohort study conducted to investigate mechanisms of severe asthma. Notably, it was found that patients with severe asthma showed increased pruning of the pulmonary vasculature that was associated with decreased lung function, greater peripheral and sputum eosinophilia, and higher BAL SAA/lipoxin A4 ratio [87]. Moreover, there is a strong correlation between elevated blood as well as sputum SAA levels and asthma prevalence and/or allergic rhinitis and disease severity [23, 24, 212]. As described above, the ability of SAA1 to adopt different oligomeric states (monomers and oligomers) [202] or to transport retinols and related molecules [187, 188] might serve to scavenge and sequester essential vitamins (or even nutrients) to deter pathogen growth at mucosal surfaces [215] and may thus have important functional implications for promoting local inflammation. Considering that SAA is increased in allergic asthma [23, 24], it remains to be established whether SAA functions as an adjuvant and/or interacts directly with environmental airborne proteins to promote allergic sensitization. Preliminary evidence of the authors (Smole et al., in revision) suggests that a component within house dust mite extracts can lead to active forms of SAA which impact on AEC and the induction of type 2 immunity, thus contributing to the priming of exposed individuals for sensitization and allergic disease (Smole et al.). A better understanding of the diverse immune protective mechanisms of acute phase SAA at mucosal surfaces may help to develop novel therapies for infectious but also inflammatory diseases such as allergic asthma and rhinitis [186].",

Serine protease activity converts the evolutionary conserved C3 molecule, which is molecularly related to alpha\u20102\u2010macroglobulin and highly abundant in human serum (1.2\u20131.3 g/L), into the small (10 kDa) and diffusible anaphylatoxin C3a and the larger opsonin fragment C3b [224, 225]. Similarly, C5 is converted into the small anaphylatoxin C5a (11 kDa) and the larger C5b fragment. The latter associates with C6 and C7, attaches to membranes (microbial or bodily) and completes the formation of the membrane attack complex by binding of C8 and C9 [223]. C3b\u2010dependent opsonization occurs upon conformational change of C3b and exposure of the hidden internal thioester bond which is highly reactive and covalently binds to nucleophils such as OH\u2010 or NH2\u2010groups in its immediate surroundings.

However, it has been clearly demonstrated that apart from other nonliver cells, such as endothelial cells and immune cells (granulocytes, monocytes, DCs, T cells), also airway epithelial cells, such as BEAS\u20102B cells, constitutively synthesize and release C3 under serum\u2010free conditions which can be significantly upregulated by IL\u20101 or TNF\u2010\u03b1 but not IFN\u2010\u03b3 [226, 227]. In addition, lung cancer cells substantially generate and release C5a, which is believed to create a milieu favourable for tumour cells and thus contributing to lung cancer progression [228]. Intratracheal instillation of C3a or peptides thereof induces respiratory distress, which is accompanied by C3\u2010dependent bronchial smooth muscle contraction in bronchioles and hemodynamic effects due to C3a\u2010induced platelet aggregation in pulmonary arteries [229, 230]. AEC (and airway smooth muscle cells) can sense complement, since both human and murine AEC express C3a\u2010 and C5a\u2010receptors under steady\u2010state conditions, which become upregulated in situations of endotoxinemia and allergen\u2010induced asthma [231]. Targeting of these receptors on AEC by intratracheal instillation of antibodies has been shown to reduce pulmonary oedema and lung injury [232, 233]. Apart from soluble complement components, AEC under steady\u2010state conditions also express transmembrane complement regulatory proteins such as Membrane cofactor protein (CD46), Decay accelerating factor (CD55) and protectin (CD59), with IFN\u2010\u03b3 able to significantly upregulate DAF levels [226]. It is therefore not surprising that complement proteins can also be detected in the BALF of healthy individuals [234] and that complement levels are increased upon exposure to bacterial danger signals such as LPS [235]. Some of these complement regulatory proteins might also contribute to the overall reduction of inflammation, such as CD46, which was shown to downregulate IL\u20101\u03b2 levels induced by H2O2\u2010activated AEC due to induction of autophagy and associated downregulation of inflammasome components like pro\u2010IL\u20101\u03b2 and NLRP3 [236]. Moreover, AEC were shown to scavenge (actively take up) C3 from their surroundings, very similar to CD4 T cells. In its intracellularly stored form, C3 is supposed to play a cytoprotective role by potentially influencing oxidative stress of AEC [237]. Production but also storage of C3 by AEC might have important implications also for end\u2010stage lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in which C3 stores in AEC are found to be increased. C3 is stored within the endoplasmic reticulum and late endosomes in its mature form, ready to become activated by cleavage. Other cell types known to not only synthesize but also store large amounts of C3 are neutrophils [238] and monocytes [239]. Moreover, T cells are not only activated by complement split products but also contain C3 and C5 intracellularly [240]. Whether T cells express and are able to activation\u2010dependently upregulate C3 and C5, or rather accumulate preformed C3 and C5 proteins present in large amounts in bodily fluids is a matter of intense discussion and might critically depended on APC\u2010T cell interaction [8, 241]. However, it has been clearly shown that T cells have complement convertase activity and can activate intracellular C3 by virtue of T cell\u2010expressed cathepsin L [9]. Secretion of such activated C3 (C3a) contributes to T cell\u2010mediated inflammation in target tissues including the lung. This also fits to the recent finding that intracellular pools of C3 become reduced upon T cell activation [8].",
