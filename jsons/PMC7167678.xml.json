To elicit support of these institutions, the first author met with the managers and different groups of Chinese elderly in the three organizations to explain the purposes of the study and invited them to participate. Informed consent was obtained from all participants before data collection. Demographic data were obtained and included age, gender, marital status, a brief medical history, current medications, religious beliefs, recent travel to Hong Kong or other SARS\u2010infected countries. Further, the researchers ensured that participation was voluntary by ensuring that the participants had adequate time to ask questions. To ensure anonymity, each participant was assigned a number on the demographic data collection tool, the cassette tapes, and the transcripts. Only the investigators had access to the tapes and demographic data. Interviews were conducted either in participants' homes or in a room provided by one of the participating organizations.",

The constant comparison method was used to compare incidents within the transcripts. Using this method, incidents were compared and patterns identified until a core variable was identified. Initially, open coding using vivo codes in the participants' words were assigned to the data. These codes were later clustered into categories and the researcher described how the different categories related to each other. Once the core variable was identified, the researcher continued to code data around the core variable to develop a parsimonious theory that could be used to explain how the Chinese elderly protect and prevent SARS.",

Fifteen of the 19 participants in this study lived with either their children or their spouses, and these living arrangements prompted them to take the responsibility to protect their family members by learning everything about protection and prevention against SARS. Further, the concept of filial piety goes beyond the obligation of showing respect to one's parents. It is seen as an ethical principle that directs one's interpersonal relationships toward one's family and others in the community. In this case, filial piety suggested the \u201cright and humane\u201d way to act toward one's family and others in the community, and guided the Chinese elderly in their use of strategies against SARS. Therefore, filial piety was two\u2010tiered: what is expected of the participants at a personal level (to protect their families) and at a societal level (to undergo voluntary isolation upon return from Hong Kong). These actions were understandable because of the serious consequences of contracting SARS. There is no question that the use of protective and preventive strategies against SARS among Chinese elderly was clearly driven and influenced by filial piety, and that concept was central to this study. The Chinese elderly were so frightened of spreading SARS to their families and others that they took all effort to make sure they would not spread the disease, as they would not be able to live with themselves. In addition to using Confucianism, participants utilized fatalism and destiny to explain the unexplainable events. This provided explanation and comfort to the participants to explain the deaths of health care professionals. Participants were all proactive and engaged in all strategies against SARS, but enlisted extra protection from deities at the same time. Their main concerns were for the well being of family and community, and these were the motives behind the initiation of all protective and preventive strategies against SARS.",

The use of food is influenced by TCM, where foods are categorized either ying () (cool) or yang () (hot) class based on the food constituents. This explained the consumption of liang () (cool) foods by the participants during the SARS outbreak, as it was believed that SARS virus proliferated more rapidly under the yang () (hot) body system. There were also differences on the types of herbs used by the participants. Those who were in Hong Kong during the SARS outbreak consumed ban lan gen () (Isatis indigotica), a herb that is considered extremely liang () (cool) in nature. Ban lan gen () (Isatis indigotica) was recommended by traditional Chinese practitioners in Hong Kong (Leung, 2004; Leung & Ooi, 2003) for the prevention of SARS. However, individuals who were in Edmonton used herbs that were less liang () (cool) in nature such as chrysanthemum and kam gan fa (), because ban lan gen () (Isatis indigotica) might not be suitable for everyone. The use of different types of herbs is based on the knowledge of contagion of SARS as a type of Wan Bing () (febrile disease) from the TCM perspective. SARS was considered a reemerging disease that often occurred during (cusp) seasonal changes with extreme weather. Although the use of herbal medicines was recommended by TCM practitioners for the prevention of SARS, only participants who were in Hong Kong at the time of the epidemics actually consumed them. All other participants in the study consumed foods that possessed cooling effects and that were believed to place the body in a better position to fight the disease. The consumption of herbs or foods by the participants depended entirely on whether or not they had been abroad in a SARS\u2010infected country. The use of herbs was discussed with TCM practitioners, and this again reflected participants' concern about the benefits and risks of the use of herbs versus the use of food for prevention of diseases including SARS. Knowledge about the use of herbs and food to prevent diseases had been culturally acquired by these Chinese elders. They were not able to explain how they attained the knowledge, but tended to believe that it was part of their experience when they were growing up. Participants were knowledgeable about the use of both Western and TCM strategies against SARS, based on the recommendations of the various health authorities and their own knowledge of food therapy. Participants' use of both Western and TCM strategies was a course of action aimed at putting themselves in the best position to combat the disease.",

In particular, public health nurses should explore the cultural components of minority groups to better understand and support the use of additional disease prevention strategies based on the health beliefs of these groups. Understanding the contagion of diseases from the individual's cultural perspective is vital if one is to provide education about the use of specific strategies in preventing the spread of diseases. Strategies recommended by health authorities must be congruent with the health beliefs of the minority group in order to encourage adherence to protocols for control of infectious diseases in the future. We trust that this study exemplifies the importance of incorporating culture as a means of revealing and interpreting responses to an urgent and immediate threat to health.
