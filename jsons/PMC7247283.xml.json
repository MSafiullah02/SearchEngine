It is based on the idea of redistribution of heat flux at the solid\u2013fluid interface. When constant heat flux is applied at the outer wall of the diverging microchannel with solid to fluid thickness ratio greater than two, then redistribution of heat flux occurs at the inner wall of the microchannel.",

This leads to a more uniform temperature in diverging microchannel compare to that in uniform cross-section (see Fig. 1d). The effect of various geometrical and flow parameters along with the thermophysical properties on constant wall temperature conditions were studied in detail and presented earlier (Duryodhan et al. 2016, 2017). This study also proposed the analytical model which can help in designing the different diverging microchannels leading to different constant temperatures as per requirement.",

            "text": "In several pathological processes, biological samples required to maintain above the room temperature (Hung et al. 2005; Wan et al. 2013; Regan et al. 2008). At conventional scale, this can be done by keeping the samples in an incubator, thermal cycler or employing phase change materials etc. However, large sample size, loss of samples, large reaction time are some of the disadvantages associated with the conventional methods which creates the hindrances in diagnosis. On the contrary, working with the small sample size provides the advantage of quick diagnosis at minimum cost. Microdevices are used to harness the advantages of using small sample volume. Integration of these portable microdevices with conventional heating systems is cumbersome. Therefore, heating of microdevices can be achieved by using microheater (Selva et al. 2010). Fundamentally, microheater-based heating is equivalent to provide constant heat flux and therefore, non-uniformity in the temperature distribution is inherently associated with this method. Various designs of microheaters have been explored by the research community in order to achieve the constant temperature as summarized by Miralles et al. (2013). Novelty of this design lies in the fact that a constant temperature boundary condition is achieved while constant heat flux is supplied at the bottom wall. Otherwise, this would require the outer chamber with phase change material and a mechanism to liquefy/solidify the material in order to use the same in closed loop. This method was developed and proposed to use for heating biological samples where constant temperature requirement is the matter of utmost important. A proof of concept for of this technology have been presented earlier using numerical simulation (Duryodhan et al. 2016).",

RT-PCR is a cyclic process of DNA amplification where each cycle consists of three steps namely denaturation, annealing and extension for which the sample is required to be maintained at constant temperatures of 95, 55 and 72 \u00b0C respectively. The technology discussed above can be used to design diverging microchannels of different geometrical configuration so that each will provide different constant temperatures as mentioned earlier. One can use the analytical model proposed by Duryodhan et al. (2016) to decide on geometrical and flow parameters. It can be fabricated on thermally conducting substrate such as silicon, glass or quartz wafer. We propose to fabricate the channel in PDMS using soft lithography which can be covered with microheater deposited silicon wafer. Care should be taken to insulate one zone from the other by etching the silicon from the interface region of two subsequent zones as shown in Fig. 2a. This will reduce heat conduction from one zone to other thereby maintaining the constant temperature in each zone.",

A limited number of DNA along with primer and reagents will then pumped through the microdevice consist of three zones of constant temperatures as shown in Fig. 2b. The sample needs to recirculate through zone 1 as indicated by dashed line in Fig. 2b. Number of cycles will be decided based on the amount of amplification required for the further processing of the sample. A diagnosis methodology recently proposed by Corman et al. (2020) can be employed for further processing of sample. Conventional methods will require separate post processing to provide the qualitative results and also costly, whereas microdevice based RT-PCR method will have the advantages of less sample size, speed, portablity and cost-effectiveness (Walker-Daniels 2012).",
