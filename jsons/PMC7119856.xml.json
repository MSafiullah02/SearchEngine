Prophylactic vaccination against IBV infection is practiced using both live and inactivated vaccines (Cavanagh and Naqi, 1997). Live IBV vaccines are administered to chickens through spray or drinking water, often as early as 1 day of age, whereas inactivated vaccines are injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly before the onset of the egg-laying cycle (Cavanagh and Naqi, 1997). IBV antibody can be detected in the serum and respiratory passages of vaccinated birds by various serological tests (Gelb, 1989).",

Such antibody has been shown to protect chicks against IBV challenge for 4 weeks depending on the methods used for challenge and subsequent evaluation of protection (Darbyshire and Peters, 1985, Mockett et al., 1987). Vaccination of 1-day-old commercial broiler chickens against IBV is widely performed. This practice raises two important concerns: (1) influence of maternal antibody (Mab) on the development of active immune response to the vaccine, and (2) effect of vaccine virus on the rate of depletion of Mab. Another basic concern is whether neonatal administration of IBV to chicks via spray or drinking water could induce an immunologic tolerance to one or more IBV antigens. The latter is a logical concern based on studies conducted in mammalian species where tolerance has been demonstrated to mucosally administered antigens (McGhee et al., 1992, van Wilsem et al., 1995, Galliaerde et al., 1995, Lamm, 1997, Weiner, 1997). In the present study, day-old vaccination did not induce \u201ctolerance\u201d to IBV, nevertheless, it was found to: (a) hasten depletion of Mab, and (b) interfere with antibody responses to both primary and secondary immunizations.",

Blood was collected either from the jugular vein or brachial vein, and chickens were subsequently euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation. In Experiment 1, the respiratory tracts of chickens were washed as described by Thompson et al. (1997). Briefly, tracheae were exposed just below the glottis and cannulated. The respiratory system of each bird was flushed three times with a total of 10 ml of warm (37\u00b0C) PBS, and the three washes from each bird were pooled. Respiratory lavage fluids in Experiments 2 and 3 were collected as described by Mockett et al. (1987) with slight modification. In this case, tracheal segments were washed between a point immediately distal to the rima glottis and immediately proximal to the point where the trachea enters the thoracic cavity. Using a micropipett with disposable tips, 0.8 ml of PBS was used to flush the trachea three times with the same fluid. The collected lavage fluids were then passed through a fine mesh (60 \u03bcm) screen, and centrifuged. The supernatant fluids were removed and used for the assessment of IBV-specific local antibody. Sera as well as lavage fluids were heat inactivated (56\u00b0C for 30 min) before use in the virus neutralisation test described below.",

At hatching, Mab+ chicks had significant levels of antibody in serum and the respiratory tract, as represented by the logarithm (log10) of geometric means, 5.2 log and 2.7 log, respectively. When challenged with IBV through the intraocular route at 1 day of age, these chicks had excellent protection with only 1 of 19 chicks yielding the challenge virus (>95% protection) 4 days post-challenge. At 7 days of age, while no remarkable change was observed in serum antibody titer, that in the respiratory system had dropped to approximately half (1.5 log) of the level recorded at day 1. This coincided with a drastic drop (<30%) in protection to virus challenge at day 7. During the remaining period (10\u201317 days), the serum-antibody levels declined gradually, remaining at an appreciable level until day 17 (>3.0 log), whereas, respiratory antibody levels fell below 1.0 log during the same period. There was no protection to IBV challenge on days 14 and 17. One hundred percent of the Mab\u2212 control chickens yielded virus at 4 days post-challenge at each of the 5 periods (data not shown).",
