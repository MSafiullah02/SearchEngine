In 400 B.C., Hippocrates suggested that the environment, including water and air, were important, and in the second century A.D., Galen suggested that outbreaks of illnesses were caused by inhaled air. For centuries thereafter, the prime theories proposed that illnesses arose from mystical influences and noxious effluvia borne by air [1]. The widespread devastation inflicted by plagues was thought to result from inhaling the putrescent vapors of decaying corpses. This belief in \u201cmiasmas\u201d (derived from the Greek word for pollution) engendered perhaps the first infection-control procedures. The unfortunate souls assigned to handle the corpses were gowned in long robes with hoods to which were attached beaks stuffed with herbs, which were intended to filter the miasmas from the air (figure 1).",

Indeed, our current term \u201cinfluenza\u201d may be traced to the Italian \u201cinfluenza coeli\u201d or \u201cinfluenza del diavolo\u201d (i.e., influence of celestial bodies or of the devil). Even in the mid-1800s, when John Snow conclusively demonstrated, during his famous investigation of the 1848\u20131854 cholera epidemic, that the disease was spread by contaminated water, the English Board of Health officially decreed that the cause was noxious vapors arising from the Thames River. Not until 1910, when Charles Chapin challenged the dominance of the airborne route by proposing that most common infectious diseases were acquired by close contact with an infected individual, was the current alternative paradigm accepted that organisms may have >1 mechanism of spread [2, 3].",

The envelope of Paramyxovirinae respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenzavirus, and influenzaviruses, is studded with the major glycoproteins, which are integral for attachment and infection of the host cell. The cellular tropism of the virus is also instrumental with regard to whether infection occurs. Most common cold viruses, such as rhinovirus, parainfluenzavirus, influenzavirus, and RSV, readily infect the epithelium of the upper airway, thus allowing infection to occur via direct contact with infectious secretions by large droplets or contaminated hands. Some organisms, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, however, require settling in the lower respiratory tract for infection to occur [6, 8].",

Among 11 subjects examined, the number of respiratory particles generated by quiet breathing varied bimodally and by individual. Over a 6-h period, 5 subjects produced only 14\u201371 particles per liter of expired air, whereas 6 volunteers exhaled 10 times that number (mean quantity, 500 particles per liter of expired air). One superlative shedder generated >3000 particles per liter of expired air during quiet breathing.

Thus, I and our staff conducted a study that examined the transmission of nosocomial influenza on our infant ward as part of our ongoing viral nosocomial studies during 2 respiratory infection seasons (November\u2013April). The aim was to determine whether nosocomial influenza resulted primarily from close contact or airborne spread in the \u201creal world\u201d of a ward housing influenza-naive infants, who would be at high risk for nosocomial infection during the busy respiratory season.",

Recognition of the pivotal role of clean hands for the control of infections may be credited to Ignaz Semmelweis. In the 1840s, he observed that fewer puerperal infections occurred in his obstetrical clinic in Vienna when he required physicians to clean their hands with a chlorine-containing solution between visits with patients. Despite the recognized importance of hand cleansing in diminishing nosocomial infections, compliance with hand hygiene procedures by health care personnel is singularly poor [3637\u201338]. This situation may be improved by the recent recommendation for the preferential use of alcohol-based hand-sanitizing products [36]. This recommendation is based on the fact that their efficacy is greater than that for soap-and-water washing in reducing the number of organisms on the skin, on the low occurrence of adverse effects, and on the resulting increased compliance by health care workers. Although use of hand sanitizers has been correlated with diminished occurrence of nosocomial infections in general, evidence that they decrease the spread of and illness associated with specific viruses is limited. Alcohol-containing products have been demonstrated in vitro to have greater efficacy against enveloped respiratory viruses than against nonenveloped viruses, including picornaviruses, parechoviruses, adenoviruses, and rotavirus. Inactivation of these latter, more-stubborn viral agents may be enhanced by higher concentrations of alcohol or by increasing the time and thoroughness of the scrubbing during hand washing.",

A review of 236 articles about the practice of using chemical disinfectants in health care facilities, however, concluded that use of these products was no more beneficial in reducing nosocomial infections than was usual cleansing with soap or detergent [39].
