These quandaries fall into two distinct categories. The first reflects human dynamics, and issues in this class include socioeconomic vulnerabilities, human rights and human dignity, harm, rationing/ triage\nand local and global justice. Central to them is what a single individual or a group of individuals within or outside the location of a disaster may do or fail to do in response to the challenges and needs of other human beings during a public health disaster.",

In the African context, this is particularly significant because most health and social institutions were established without genuine local interests in mind and with goals alien to the local logic and interests.4 As such, policies tainted by this background or other kinds of policies, poor or good, or badly implemented ones, will shape social realities by influencing the actions and inactions of different sets of people. O\u2019Hare recently observed that the minimal expenditure on health historically contributed to the crippling of the Sierra Leonean healthcare system. He noted that the country (where 53% of the population live below the poverty line) spends $25 million on health and $244 million to give tax incentives to foreign companies and organizations.5 In other words, a more rational and need-based spending would have enhanced the capacity of health institutions to mount a better response to the Ebola incident.

In this vein, Kentikelenis et al. argue that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) contributed to the circumstances that enabled the crisis to arise and/or worsen in the west African region through their prior policies that had partly weakened the health systems in countries like Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone,7 Specifically, the conditionalities of the IMF which mandated recipient governments to adopt policies that prioritize short-term economic objectives over investment in healthcare and education8 may be fingered because Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have received IMF support since 1990.9 This clearly suggests that the vulnerability of people to health disasters such as Ebola in these regions and the attendant trans-border health risks posed to nearby nations and the global village may begin prior to any specific incident.",

Some policy deficits which may facilitate PHDs, are however, found in several nations, hence, are global in nature. Whereas cases of atypical drug-resistant TB have been identified in fifty different countries,13 diagnostic capacities are generally poor across the globe. Lack of policy in this direction is worrisome because drug-resistant TB is one of the most profound challenges facing global health.14\n",

These cases underscored how an infectious disease outbreak in just a place poses a significant risk everywhere15 and the capacity of trans-national infectious diseases to get out of control if not handled properly. This notion was exemplified in China\u2019s slow reaction to the 2003 SARS outbreak and how the country restricted international access to patients and information which is believed to have contributed to the global intensity of that crisis.16 In other words, how a local public health disaster is handled determines and influences local severity, and how it spreads elsewhere. On the other hand, well-handled local health crises positively shape the possible impacts on contiguous nations as was demonstrated by Canada\u2019s rapid and coordinated response to the SARS outbreak which limited its spread and impact in the United States.17\n",

Socioeconomic vulnerabilities, for instance, facilitate poor health and biological vulnerability to diseases such as pandemic influenza, tuberculosis, and Ebola infections, and is often borne out of the absence of state-financed subsidizing of health for the indigent. People who have never cared for the rights of others can hardly be counted upon to respect the rights of victims of disasters. Indeed, victims of disasters who have been brought up in contexts bereft of an understanding of rights will hardly know when their rights are violated by public health measures such as forced quarantine. In addition, those who associate some rights violation with quarantine measures and whose input has not been sought prior to the implementation of such measures will likely resist or not comply. This played out significantly during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.18 Such contextual social resistance may inadvertently bring about positive outcomes. For instance, protests at the location of Ebola quarantine center in a crowded hospital in Abuja, Nigeria compelled the government to relocate it to a safer place, thus, potentially preventing infection transmission. However, they may also bring about negative outcomes. For example, public outcry and social resistance led to the suspension of an Ebola trial in 2015.19\n",

It also suggests the possibility that responses to the quandaries and challenges associated with such natural disasters may not be adequately engaged through human-based ethical reasoning and responses alone. Thirdly, it implies that ignorance of the \u201cdivine will\u201d or disobedience to it will exert tangible effects on personal and social life in the form of divine retribution.

One-time events and metaphysical realities are outside the purview of scientific investigations because they are non-replicable. Secondly, there are several transcultural accounts of how the supernatural has causally influenced human behavior and experiences, as well as the course of natural events. For instance, there are verifiable miracles that have occurred within the Christian tradition that defy scientific explanations.25 Divine interventions have also been recorded in several traditional religions across the globe.26 Similarly, religious relics have been used in Sicily to thwart earthquakes.27\n",

Beyond offering a descriptive account, such an approach should also provide some normative template that bears a relationship to the scientific as well as the religious. Without a doubt, public health disasters foster suffering. But they also create the atmosphere for sober reflection which may facilitate personal ratiocination vis-\u00e0-vis the individual relationship (if any) to the divine.

These dynamics cannot be adequately addressed by each of the context-specific moral approaches developed for specific PHDs in Chaps. 10.1007/978-3-319-92765-7_2 through 10.1007/978-3-319-92765-7_5, that is, the Ubuntu ethic, care ethics, communitarianism, anthropo-ecological ethics and solidaristic moral lens. While each of these may have limited normative power in engaging the broader ethical issues that public health disasters generate, they clearly underscore the relevance of an other-centric orientation, the importance and contexts of solidarity as well as the need to incorporate microbial as well as religious or metaphysical metrics into a useful normative approach to public health disasters.",

Therefore, to properly engage these quandaries as well as the other practical challenges, it is important to understand the complex human, biological and, possibly, metaphysical variables that resonate around them. On this note, the chapter developed a global ethical framework based on five relational moral nuggets. These are respect for transnational values, respect for biological relatedness, respect for spiritual/metaphysical causal appeals and diversity, responsiveness to vulnerabilities, and responsibility.",

            "text": "The chapter also highlighted how a relational-based global ethic may be applied to public health disasters as an important contemporary global problem . Because personal morality often differs from public morality, and because other-centricity is hardly a norm in contemporary society, it is important to seek creative ways to create some level of other-centricity in the populace prior to the occurence of a PHD. Social and formal education and a right psychological mindset158 are essential to realizing this goal. Finally, this chapter offered four levels of justification for the proposed global ethic. In this vein, it argued that the proposed ethic is justified for engaging public health disasters as a class of global problems because it is responsive and sensitive to local realities, global realities, microbial as well as spiritual realities and scientific concerns. By reflecting these four values, the GEF is sufficiently nuanced to engage different Western and non-Western contexts. This is important because nuances permit challenging and unusual scenarios to be flexibly engaged using the same frame of reference.159\n",
