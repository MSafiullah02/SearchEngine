The proposed work aims to extract and evaluate the Coronavirus disease caused pneumonia infection in lung using CT scans. We propose an image-assisted system to extract COVID-19 infected sections from lung CT scans (coronal view). It includes following steps: (i) Threshold filter to extract the lung region by eliminating possible artifacts; (ii) Image enhancement using Harmony-Search-Optimization and Otsu thresholding; (iii) Image segmentation to extract infected region(s); and (iv) Region-of-interest (ROI) extraction (features) from binary image to compute level of severity. The features that are extracted from ROI are then employed to identify the pixel ratio between the lung and infection sections to identify infection level of severity. The primary objective of the tool is to assist the pulmonologist not only to detect but also to help plan treatment process. As a consequence, for mass screening processing, it will help prevent diagnostic burden. respiratory system and the untreated lung disease will lead to death. The major causes of lung defects are due to diseases, such as tuberculosis, lung-cancer, and pneumonia [1, 2] . Further, the infection in lungs due to microorganisms, such as bacteria, virus and fungi may cause mild to harsh illness; which may require instantaneous medical support to cure the disease.",

The laboratory tests include common procedures, like complete-blood-count, blood-gas-analysis and pleural-fluid-analysis [3, 4] . The nonlaboratory tests are mainly the image assisted techniques used to record or inspect the lung regions using chest radiography (X-ray), Computed-Tomography (CT) scan and bronchoscope. Due to its non-invasive nature, the chest X-ray and CT are commonly used to record the digital images of the lungs, which can be further examined by an experienced doctor or a computer-supported system to identify the severity of the infection. Compared to the chest X-ray, the CT Scan Images (CTSI) is widely preferred due to its merit and the three-dimensional view of the lung; which further can be used to provide 2D images of axial, coronal and Sagittal-View for the better diagnosis. The recent studies also confirmed the merit of the CT in detecting the infection in the respiratory tract and pneumonia [5] .",

The recent studies on COVID-19 infection confirmed that, the assessment of disease severity rate is essential to plan for the appropriate treatment to cure the patients. In real-time scenarios, infected regions from the bio-imaging methods, such as CT and chest radiographs are assessed by an experienced doctor and based on the recommendation; possible treatment procedures are suggested and implemented to reduce the infection level. The personal detection with an experienced doctor will be a tedious task when the number of patients is large and hence, it is necessary to develop an automated/semi-automated image processing procedure to assist the doctor to examine the lung images of the patients. This procedure will considerably reduce the diagnostic burden of the doctor by segregating the lung CTSI based on the severity level. Further, this procedure also will assist the doctor to track the changes in infection rate (reduction/progress in infection) when the treatment is implemented.",

Further, the work of Li et al. [6] also suggested that, visual quantitative analysis using the CTSI provided good reliability and better diagnostic capability.

In this work, Harmony-Search-Optimization (HSO) algorithm is implemented to find the optimal threshold due to its simplicity and lesser tuning parameters. Initially, the threshold selection is done using the entropy techniques [35, 36] and Otsu between-class function [37] and the enhancement achieved with Otsu is superior compared to other technique.
