Like other neonates, the foal is probably born with an immature intestinal tract39 that is well adapted for a milk diet. The large intestine receives little ingesta that requires bacterial fermentation before absorption. Buffering mechanisms for colonic fermentation (ileal chloride/bicarbonate exchange) and for absorption of fermentation by-products are probably poorly developed and are certainly not needed in a foal on a milk diet. However, as the foal explores its environment and begins to eat less digestible material, such as grain, hay, and straw, its large intestine must adapt by developing the necessary flora for bacterial fermentation and the mechanisms needed for efficient absorption of the byproducts. If the colon contains a relative excess of such substrate before the absorptive mechanisms are fully developed, diarrhea may result. The transient nature of the diarrhea may reflect rapid functional maturation of the large intestine. The period of diarrhea is approximately equal to the epithelial generation time.",

Because lactose is the primary milk sugar, lactose intolerance will cause significant diarrhea in foals. Lactase deficiency can be demonstrated by comparing glucose and lactose absorption curves.37 The standard glucose absorption test (1 gm per kg after a 12-hour fast) should be performed. If a normal peak is found, the same procedure should be followed replacing glucose with twice the weight of lactose, for lactase enzymatically splits lactose into glucose and galactose.

However, because most foals have repeated exposure, these changes are not usually evident. A therapeutic trial with thiabendazole (440 mg per kg on two consecutive days), fenbendazole (10 mg per kg on five consecutive days), or ivermectin may be rewarding in suspicious cases. Occasionally, repeated larvicidal therapy appears to be helpful. Although most of the damage can be repaired leaving only fibrosis,19 the repair process may take a month to 6 weeks.",

The source of the virus in such outbreaks is probably adult subclinical shedders.15., 56., 77. The virus can also be shed subclinically in foals for up to 8 months.14 Because of its ability to survive up to 9 months in the environment15 and its widespread prevalence in the equine population, epidemics are most likely to occur when population pressures and management practices favor heavy contamination of the environment. Because of the widespread nature of the pathogen, it is likely that most mares produce some protective antibodies in their colostrum; however, this antibody will not be protective against an overwhelming infective dose.77 Although only a small percentage of foals will show clinical signs, it is very likely that 100 per cent of the foals on the property are infected during epidemics.77\n",

Thus, there is not only a loss of absorptive epithelial cells but also a hypertrophy of crypt secretory cells with the net result of decreased absorption of substrates and increased secretion.41 Although the villus-to-crypt ratio may be decreased for up to 21 days, signs usually do not persist for this period of time.77 With the loss of function of the small intestine, the neonate whose large intestine has not developed to a point where it could compensate would be likely to show more severe signs than a weanling.4\n",

This test takes advantage of a group-specific antigen common to rotaviruses from all species (except pararotaviruses). Thus, it can be used to identify rotavirus from numerous species.

Conversely, it is assumed that if a pathogen is not found in the feces of an animal with diarrhea, it is not causing the problem. Neither is true. Because of the apparent high incidence of subclinical infection,77 the virus may be detected even though it is not causing clinical signs. A further complicating factor is infection by multiple pathogens. In calves and pigs, rotavirus infections are often complicated by concurrent infections with bacteria such as E. coli, Salmonella, or other viruses, such as coronavirus.77 In foals, infection has been concurrent with Salmonella infection.23., 69. Thus, the search for possible pathogens should not stop with the detection of one. Diagnostic attempts should be made during the first few days of illness, because viruses are often shed only early in the disease, even before the onset of diarrhea.56., 63.\n",

Increased transit rate of ingesta through the gastrointestinal tract is a natural defense mechanism of the host; it effectively removes toxins and agents before they are absorbed or can invade. Thus, diarrhea in itself may be therapeutic, and it may be contraindicated to interfere with transit rate. The problem arises when there is massive fluid loss leading to dehydration along with the increased transit rate. Our efforts should focus on decreasing this fluid output, changing net secretion to net absorption. Antimotility and anticholinergic agents should be avoided, but drugs such as bismuth subsalicylate, which may be antisecretory, may be helpful. Bismuth subsalicylate at a dose of 6 oz per 45 kg given two to four times a day, has decreased diarrhea in some cases. Other agents, such as activated charcoal or kaolin and pectin, may also be helpful. If these agents do not produce a change in the diarrhea within 48 to 72 hours, continued use is not indicated. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be beneficial in decreasing the secretory component of the diarrhea, but because of their potential toxicity, which may be manifested by gastrointestinal signs, they should be used with caution and moderation.",

For this reason, most manufacturers use combinations. The most effective antacids on the market today are combinations of aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide.7., 52.\n",
