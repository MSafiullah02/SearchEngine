The economic losses associated with this disease are due not only to the resulting mortality, but also to the retarded growth of the animals, the cost of both the veterinary care and the drugs used to treat the infection, and the increased labor involved (de Graaf et al., 1999). Several enteropathogens are associated with diarrhea in neonatal calves, the most prevalent being Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella spp., Cryptosporidium spp., and rotavirus and coronavirus, with their relative importance varying by geographic region (Snodgrass et al., 1986, Younis et al., 2009).",

Phage therapy is considered a potentially low-cost treatment modality and was first implemented by Felix d'Herelle more than 90 years ago. However, the development of antibiotics in the 1940s put a halt to commercial production of therapeutic phages in most Western countries whereas in the Soviet Union, enteric diseases, nosocomial infections, burn and wound infections continued to be treated with phage preparations on a very large scale and apparently with some success (Sulakvelidze, 2005). Therefore, our objective was to evaluate the effect of oral administration of bacteriophages on fecal E. coli CFU. Additionally, it was also our objective to assess the survivability of the phages and the impact of oral phage administration on calf health. Our one-sided hypothesis was that oral administration of E. coli bacteriophages would cause a reduction in fecal E. coli CFU.",

Additionally, the log CFU of the phage-treated group decreased quickly after the first phage treatment was administered, indicating a potential treatment effect. Nevertheless, despite the known in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of the phage cocktail against E. coli strains (Bicalho et al., 2010), repeated oral application of high titers of phage cocktail did not significantly reduce fecal E. coli CFU. However, the statistical power of our study was limited, given that only 10 calves were enrolled. To evaluate the susceptibility of phages to acidity, an in vitro experiment was carried out in which the phages were exposed to a range of pH values. Dilutions of 10\u2076 and 10\u2077 showed higher lytic action among all the serial dilutions made in our laboratory. Relative viability was estimated by comparing the phage titer in acidic SM buffer with that in neutral SM buffer, pH 7.5. Phages were nonviable at pH 1 and 2. The effects of higher pH (pH 3\u201311) on the viability of all 4 phages used in this study were not evident (Fig. 2\n).",

In that study, when the populations of E. coli O157:H7 in waste-water streams increased so did the populations of bacteriophage that were active against E. coli O157:H7. This is because the host specificity of each phage depends on its ability to recognize specific cell-surface receptors (Tanji et al., 2003). Such strain specificity could be an explanation for the observation that the stool samples of the control group did not present any phages (environmental in origin), because the host used for phage enumeration was an E. coli strain isolated from the uterus of a metritic dairy cow.",

Bacteriophage survived in vitro exposure to pH levels as low as 3 and as high as 11 and a complete absence of phage was observed at pH \u2264 2. No side effects of oral phage therapy were observed on the health of the study calves throughout the study period. Further study of oral bacteriophage therapy is warranted in field trials, using larger number of animals, as a potential non-antibiotic therapy against newborn colibacillosis.",
