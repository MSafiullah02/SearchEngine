Jing Liu et al[6] demonstrated a significant reduction in CD8 cell counts with an insignificant decrease in CD4 counts in peripheral blood in severe cases when compared to mild cases. The T cells, although reduced in number, show hyperactivity as evidenced by the high proportions of HLA-DR and CD38 expression. Additionally, CD8+ cells contain higher concentrations of cytotoxic granules of perforin and granulysin but are grossly reduced in number.[4], [6] This implies an over-activation of T cells, and high cytotoxicity of CD8 T cells leading to an exaggerated immune response. This is substantiated by the increased expression of IL6, IL10, IL2 and IFN-\u03b3 in the sera of severe cases when compared with that of the mild cases.[6]\n",

This makes it well suited for therapeutic interventions using allogenic transfers without HLA matching.[17] In the presence of an exaggerated immune response as seen in COVID 19 patients with cytokine storm and ARDS the pro-inflammatory cytokines bring out an anti-inflammatory effect on the MSCs. The MSCs secrete several soluble factors such as Nitric oxide (NO) Transforming growth factor (TGF) beta Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) indoleamine 2 3-dioxygenase (IDO) HLA -G5 and soluble interleukin 6 . These molecules then inhibit the proliferation and activation of TH1 and TH17 cell lines thereby decreasing the production of interferon-gamma and interleukin 17. They also inhibit the activation of cytotoxic CD8 +cells thereby reducing direct injury to lung parenchyma. The activity and maturity of dendritic cells are also reduced via PGE2 pathways hence decreasing TNF alpha and increasing IL10 which is anti-inflammatory. This then activates T reg cells that regulate the T cell activity and further increase the production of IL10. The NK cells are suppressed both by the secretion of these soluble molecules as well as contact-mediated communication with MSCs. MSCs also bring about increased mobilization and decreased chemotaxis of neutrophils. [12], [13], [14]\n",
