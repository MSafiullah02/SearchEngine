Modeling approaches were increasingly used during the first two decades of the AIDS pandemic for predicting the further course of the epidemic and for trying to identify the most effective prevention strategies. But the real impact of mathematical modeling on public health came with the need for evaluating intervention strategies for newly emerging and reemerging pathogens. In the first instance it was the fear of a bioterrorist attack with smallpox virus that sparked off the use of mathematical modeling to combine historical data from smallpox outbreaks with questions about vaccination in modern societies (Ferguson et al. 2003) . Later the outbreak of the SARS virus as a newly emerging pathogen initiated the use of mathematical modeling for analyzing infectious disease outbreak data in real time to assess the effectiveness of intervention measures (Wallinga and Teunis 2004) .",

This mechanistic description makes it possible to describe the time evolution of an epidemic in mathematical terms and in this way connect the individual level process of transmission with a population level description of incidence and prevalence of an infectious disease. The rigorous mathematical way of formulating these dependencies leads to the necessity of analyzing all dynamic processes that contribute to disease transmission in much detail. Therefore, developing a mathematical model helps to focus thoughts on the essential processes involved in shaping the epidemiology of an infectious disease and to reveal the parameters that are most influential and amenable for control.

The number of infected persons that will try to cross the border from an infected country into a country that is not yet infected will increase exponentially with a growth rate r. Closing the borders will stop most infected persons, but a proportion p might slip through. Therefore, closing the borders will result in a reduction by a factor p of the exponential growth of number of imported cases. This reduction corresponds to a delay in the exponential growth of the number of imported cases (specifically, the delay is at most (-ln p /ln R) T). Therefore, border closure will only postpone the import of cases for a few generations of infection. For example, if closure was to reduce all of those infected travelers who would ordinarily have crossed the border to 1%, the introduction of an influenza epidemic may be delayed by about a month, and the introduction of a smallpox epidemic may be delayed by about 2 months.",

If a novel infection starts spreading, such as SARS in 2003, these key variables are unknown. But even if an outbreak of a more familiar infection occurs, such as norovirus, we might be groping in the dark about the precise values of these key variables. Yet, if modeling is to be helpful in infectious disease control, it is crucial to have the best possible estimates for the generation time and the reproduction number, along with other quantities such as the incubation time and hospitalization rate. Estimation would be easy if we had perfect information about the outbreak. If we would know exactly who had infected whom, and if we know precisely who was infected when, we could simply measure the duration of each time interval from infection of a case back to time of infection of its source, and the distribution of the length of these time intervals would inform us about the generation interval. Similarly, we could simply count for each infected individual how many others were infected by this individual, and the distribution of such counts would inform us about the reproduction number. Of course, in a real world such information is not available and we have to deal with incomplete observations, proxy measures, and reporting delays. But real-time estimating procedures have been proposed that attempt to reconstruct the likely patterns of who infected whom, and who was infected when, from the incomplete data and proxy measures, using standard statistical techniques for dealing with missing data and censoring (Wallinga and Teunis 2004; Cauchemez et al. 2006) . The main message is that during an outbreak it is important to collect data on cases (time of symptom onset) and about the relation between cases (existence of an epidemiological link). The more accurate this data is, the more useful it is to estimate the key model ingredients, the generation time T and the reproduction number R, and the more helpful this data can be in predicting the likely future course of the epidemic without intervention and the required control effort to curb the epidemic.",

            "text": "Many of the above ideas can be formalized mathematically in the so-called SIR model that describes the dynamics of different states of individuals in the population in terms of a system of ordinary differential equations. The variables of the system are given by the compartments described above: the group of susceptible persons (denoted by S), the group of infected persons (denoted by I), and the group of removed persons (removed from the process of transmission by immunity) (denoted by R). The mathematical model provides a precise description of the movements in and out of the three compartments. Those movements are birth (flow into the compartment of susceptible individuals), death (flow out of all compartments), transmission of infection (flow from S into I), and recovery (flow from I into R) ( Transitions between compartments are governed by rates, which in the simplest version of the model are assumed to be constant in time. The birth rate \u03bd describes the recruitment of new susceptibles into the population, the death rate \u03bc the loss of individuals due to a disease-unrelated background mortality, and \u03b3 denotes the recovery rate of infected individuals into immunity. The key element of the model is the term describing transmission of infection according to a rate \u03b2 using a mass action term. The idea behind using a mass action term to describe transmission is that individuals of the population meet each other at random and each individual has the same probability per unit time to meet each other individual. Therefore, for a susceptible person the rate of meeting infected persons depends on their density or prevalence in the population, or in mathematical terms \u03bb = \u03b2I, where \u03bb is the so-called force of infection. The force of infection is a measure of the risk of a susceptible person to become infected per unit time. It depends on prevalence, either in an absolute sense on the number of infected people in the population, or in a relative sense on the fraction of infected people in the population. In the latter case we would get \u03bb = \u03b2I / N with N denoting the total population size. The parameter \u03b2 is a composite parameter measuring the contact rate \u03ba and the probability of transmission upon contact q, so \u03b2= \u03baq.

            "text": "The most important concepts of epidemic models can be demonstrated using the SIR model. Let us first consider an infectious disease which spreads on a much faster time scale than the demographic process. Then, on the scale of disease transmission the birth rate \u03bd and the death rate \u03bc can be considered to be close to zero. When can the prevalence in the population increase? An increase in prevalence is equivalent with dI/dt > 0, which means that \u03b2SI/N > \u03b3 I. This leads to \u03b2S/N > \u03b3 or equivalently to \u03b2S/(\u03b3 N)>1. In the situation that all individuals of the population are susceptible we have S = N; this means that an infectious disease can spread in a completely susceptible population if \u03b2/\u03b3 >1. The quantity R 0 = \u03b2/\u03b3 is also known as the basic reproduction number and can in principle be determined for every infectious disease model and can be estimated for every infectious disease. In biological terms the basic reproduction number describes the number of secondary infections produced by one index case in a completely susceptible population during his entire infectious period (Diekmann et al. 1990; Diekmann and Heesterbeek 2000) . The effective reproduction number R -as mentioned in Section 12.2-describes the number of secondary cases per index case in a situation where intervention measures are applied or where a part of the population has already been infected and is now immune. If R 0 > 1 the infection can spread in the population, because on average every infected individual replaces himself by more than one new infected person. However, this process can only continue as long as there are sufficiently many susceptible individuals available. Once a larger fraction of the population has gone through the infection and has become immune, the probability of an infected person to meet a susceptible person decreases and with it the average number of secondary cases produced. If -as we assumed above -there is no birth into the population, no new susceptible individuals are coming in and the epidemic outbreak will invariably end. Analysis of the model shows, however, that the final size of the outbreak will never encompass the entire population, but there will always be a fraction of susceptible individuals left over after the outbreak has subsided. It can be shown that the final size A (attack rate in epidemiological terms) is related to the basic reproduction number by the implicit formula A = 1 -exp(-R 0 A). In other words, if the basic reproduction number of an infectious disease is known, the attack rate in a completely susceptible population can be derived.",

Now if R 0 > 1 the system can develop into an equilibrium state where the supply of new susceptible persons by birth is balanced by the transmission process and on average every infected person produces one new infection. This so-called endemic equilibrium can be computed from the model equations by setting the left-hand sides to zero and solving for the variables S, I, and R in terms of the model parameters.

This means we can compute the critical vaccination coverage p c , i.e., the threshold coverage needed for elimination from 0 = 1-1 / R 0 -p c as p c = 1 -1 / R 0 . As we would expect intuitively, the larger the basic reproduction number, the higher the fraction of the population that has to be vaccinated in order to eliminate an infection from the population. However, it also follows that elimination can be reached without vaccinating everybody in the population. The reason is that with an increasing density of immune persons in the population, the risk for those who are not yet vaccinated to be exposed decreases. This effect -the indirect protection of susceptible individuals by increasing levels of immunity in the population -is known as herd immunity. Besides the positive effect of decreasing the risk of infection for non-vaccinated persons, herd immunity has the sometimes adverse effect of increasing the mean age at first infection in the population. This can lead to an increased incidence of adverse events following infection, if the coverage of vaccination is not sufficiently high.",

Compartments describing a latent period, the vaccinated population, chronic and acute stages of infection, and many more have been described in the literature (Anderson and May 1991). Another important refinement of compartmental models is to incorporate heterogeneity of the population into the model, for example, by distinguishing between population subgroups with different behaviors or population subgroups with differences in susceptibility or geographically distinct populations. Heterogeneity in behavior was first introduced into models describing the spread of sexually transmitted infections by Hethcote and Yorke (Hethcote and Yorke 1994) . Later, during the first decade of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, models were proposed that were able to describe population heterogeneity in sexual activity and mixing patterns between population subgroups of various sexual activity levels (Koopman et al. 1988 ). Models of this type are used frequently for assessing the effects of intervention on the spread of sexually transmitted infections. Age structure has also been modeled as a series of compartments with individuals passing from one compartment to the next according to an aging rate, but this requires a large number of additional compartments to be added to the model structure. This also shows the limitation of compartmental models: with increasing structure of the population the number of compartments increases rapidly and with it the necessity to define and parameterize the mixing between all the population subgroups in the model. The theory of how to define and compute the basic reproduction number in heterogeneous populations was developed by Diekmann et al. (1990) . Geographically distinct population groups with interaction among each other have been investigated using the framework of meta-populations for analyzing the dynamics of childhood infections (Rohani et al. 1999 ).",

In reality this is not always the case. For example, when analyzing epidemic outbreaks in small populations such as schools or small villages, typical stochastic events can occur such as extinction of the infection from the population or large stochastic fluctuations in the final size of the epidemic. In contrast to deterministic models, stochastic models are formulated in terms of integers with probabilities describing the transitions between states. This means that outcomes are given in terms of probability distributions such as the final size distribution. Questions of stochastic influences on infectious disease dynamics have been studied in various ways, starting with the Reed-Frost model for a discrete time transmission of infection up to a stochastic version of the SIR model introduced above (Bailey 1975; Becker 1989) . Finally, stochastic models have been investigated using simulation techniques also known as Monte Carlo simulations. An important theoretical result from the analysis of stochastic models is the distinction between minor and major outbreaks for infectious diseases with R 0 >1. While in a deterministic model a R 0 larger than unity always leads to an outbreak if the infection is introduced into an entirely susceptible population, in a stochastic model a certain fraction of introductions remain minor outbreaks with only a few secondary infections. This leads to a bimodal probability distribution of the final epidemic size following the introduction of one infectious index case. The peak for small outbreak sizes describes the situation that the infection dies out after only a few secondary infections, the peak for large outbreak sizes describes those outbreaks that take off and affect a large part of the population. The larger the basic reproduction number, the larger the fraction of major outbreaks in the susceptible population (Andersson and Britton 2000) .",

In the context of the spread of sexually transmitted diseases models were developed that take the duration of partnerships into account, the socalled pair formation models (Hadeler et al. 1988) . Extending those models to also include simultaneous long-term partnerships leads to the class of network models, where the network of contacts is described by a graph with nodes representing individuals and links representing their contacts (Keeling and Eames 2005) . Different network structural properties have been related to the speed of spread of an epidemic through the population. In the so-called small world networks, most contacts between individuals are local, but some long-distance contacts ensure a rapid global spread of an epidemic (Watts and Strogatz 1998) . Long-distance spread of infections is becoming increasingly important in a globalizing world with increasing mobility -as the example of the SARS epidemic in 2003 demonstrated. Recently the concept of scale-free networks where the number of links per node follows a power law distribution (i.e., the probability for a node to have k links is proportional to k -\u03b3 with a positive constant \u03b3 ) was discussed in relation to the spread of epidemics. With respect to the spread of sexually transmitted diseases a network structure where some individuals have very many partners while the majority of people have only few might lead to great difficulties in controlling the disease by intervention (Liljeros et al. 2001) . Network concepts have also been applied to study the spread of respiratory diseases (Meyers et al. 2003 ).",
