Forterre, the cellular Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) had an RNA genome and harbored a variety of already created RNA-containing viruses. During the next step, DNA and DNA viruses had been invented. Three distinct DNA viruses, which had infected RNA genome-containing cells, gave rise to the three distinct domains of life, bacteria, archea, and eukarya (Forterre, 2006) . A detailed hypothetical evolutionary scenario was described by E. Koonin and colleagues (Koonin and Martin, 2005; Koonin et al., 2006) . The authors suggest that life has originated in inorganic compartments serving as surrogate cells. RNA molecules with enzymatic activities (ribozymes) could attain there relatively high concentrations and could move between compartments and \"infect\" them. At this precellular stage, several fundamental inventions had been consecutively made. The invention of proteins led to the appearance of viruses with positive single-strand and with double-strand RNA genomes. The invention of DNA resulting from RNA-dependent DNA synthesis led to the appearance of retroviruses, retroid viruses and retroposons. Finally, DNA-dependent DNA synthesis had been invented, giving rise to the appearance of viruses with double-strand DNA genomes and DNA plasmids. Only after achieving such genetic variability and richness, the \"pre-archeal\" and \"pre-bacterial\" inorganic compartments had been replaced by cellular forms, which retained numerous ancient viruses. The engulfment of a bacterium by an archaeon was the starting point of eukarya, which acquired viruses of both of their \"parents\". According to Koonin, the major classes of viruses do not have a common origin in the traditional sense but neither are they unrelated. On the other hand, a very significant proportion of the cellular genetic material has evolutionary relatedness to the genetic composition of the ancient world of RNA viruses. It is estimated that well over a half of mammalian genome is inherited from viruses. In other words, \"the tree of life and its root are immersed in a viral ocean\" (Bamford, 2003) .",

The frequency of mutations in DNA viruses may be several orders of magnitude lower than in RNA viruses, whose replicative enzyme, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, lacks proof-reading activity. The error frequency in RNA viruses is also variable, and, in some of them, any newly synthesized genomic RNA molecule contains on an average a mutation. Such viruses exist on the edge of mutational catastrophe: even a few-fold increase in the error frequency may result in population extinction. Nevertheless, a certain level of replicative infidelity is highly advantageous for viruses since it confers a potential for changing and adaptation. For example, replicative errors are one of the major factors contributing to the development of drug-resistance and hence to the scarcity of efficacious antiviral drugs. Interestingly, a single point mutation in the poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase increases its fidelity several-fold. However, the more accurate mutant is less fit: not only it develops drug-resistance less readily, but is also less neurovirulent Kirkegaard, 2003, 2005; Vignuzzi et al., 2006) . A heterogeneous population, as a group, may have advantages over a more homogeneous population. The advantages may be due not only to a greater potential for adaptation but also to the possibility of mutual cooperation.",

However, despite their intrinsic instability, viral genomes, even in the extreme case of RNA viruses, are remarkably robust. Several factors contribute to the genetic stability of viruses in nature. Adverse mutations are eliminated by negative selection, whereas fitness-increasing mutations are nearly not-existing in constant environment. Adaptive mutations may be positively selected upon environmental changes (including infection of a novel host species). The only major factor favoring accumulation of neutral mutations is bottlenecking (stochastic picking up a single viral particle, or a few of them, from a heterogeneous population), which is quite common during natural transmission of viruses. Consecutive bottlenecking events may result in a more or less marked decrease in viral fitness (the so called Muller's ratchet) because viral genomes picked up by chance from a heterogeneous population may well harbor detrimental mutations.",

For efficient viral reproduction in the brain, interaction of a translational control element (IRES) in the 5 -noncoding region (5NCR) of the viral RNA with a host protein, neural polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (nPTB), is essential (Pilipenko et al., 2001) . A single point mutation in one of the nPTB-binding sites of the viral RNA led to a dramatic decrease in viral neurovirulence: \u223c10 4 more mutant particles were now needed to kill a mouse. However, wild-type level of neurovirulence could readily be restored by either reversion or pseudoreversions during viral reproduction, e.g., by generation of a new nPTB-binding site in the viral 5NCR due to a compensating point mutation (Pilipenko et al., 2001 ). An 8-nt deletion in the 5NCR of poliovirus RNA severely impaired viral fitness and nearly killed the virus. However, this defect could be readily fixed by natural pseudoreversions of at least three different kinds, including point mutations, insertions and extended deletions (Pilipenko et al., 1992; Gmyl et al., 1993) .",

It is well known that specific viruses can infect only specific organisms and can damage in these organisms only specific organs and tissues. An important factor contributing to this specific pathogenicity is the viral host range, i.e., the ability or inability to infect a given type of cells. Main factors controlling the host range are availability of appropriate receptors on the cell surface, appropriate intracellular milieu, and status of the innate immunity. Virus-induced damage to cells may be caused by many factors and among them by competition for resources and for cellular infrastructure.

To control the enormous population of imported European rabbits, which became major pests for agricultural industry, it was decided to use the fibroma/ myxoma virus. This virus induces benign tumors in American rabbits but causes severe generalized lethal lesions in European ones. As expected, virus introduction resulted in mosquito-borne (summer) epizootics, with >99% of the infected rabbits dying in less than 2 weeks. Naturally occurring less virulent virus variants had more chances for overwintering, the circumstance resulting in selection of attenuated viruses.

In fact, influenza virus is in most cases a nonpathogenic or slightly pathogenic avian enteric virus. To infect a human, an avian flu virus should change its receptor specificity, which depends on the interaction of viral hemagglutinin (HA) with a cellular membrane glycoprotein receptor. Generally, it is sufficient to change only two amino acid residues in the avian HA to allow it to efficiently recognize the human receptor. Such a change in the host range may be achieved by either mutations in the avian HA or acquisition by an avian virus of the HA gene from human influenza virus as a result of genetic exchange (reassortment) between these viruses during mixed infections. Adaptation of flu viruses to humans may also require mutations in other viral genes.

Qualitatively new variants are emerging from time to time, primarily through reassortment (\"antigenic shift\"). The Spanish (1918) flu was just one of such \"shifted\" variants, as judged by the nucleotide sequence of its genomic RNA determined from archival formalin-treated paraffin-embedded as well as permafrost samples (Tumpey et al., 2005) . It was established that the deadly virus was indeed of avian origin and that the \"jump\" into humans was associated with alterations in the HA and some other genes. The virus was reconstructed on the basis of known nucleotide sequence of its genome, and its pathogenic properties were confirmed and further investigated. The causative agents of the two next influenza pandemics, the \"Asian\" (1957) and \"Hong-Kong\" (1968) viruses, also resulted from reassortment between avian and human viruses. Currently newly emerging, highly pathogenic avian virus (H5N1) presents a potential threat of a new pandemic. Although cases of human-to-human transmission of this virus are so far extremely rare and only occur during close family contacts, the possibility of acquisition of ominous mutations cannot be ruled out.",

SIVs are viruses that infect some 40 different nonhuman primate species in sub-Saharan Africa. Primates naturally infected with SIV do not appear to develop immunodeficiency. The immediate precursor of HIV-1 was a virus, SIVcpz, which infects chimpanzees of the subspecies Pan troglodytes troglodytes in West Central Africa. Interestingly, SIVcpz strains have been transmitted from chimps to humans on at least three independent occasions, with the current HIV-1 group M pandemic strain (>60 million people infected, >20 million deaths) resulting from just one of these transmissions. The trans-species transmission appeared to require multiple adaptation events, such as changed transmission mode (from bite/wounds to sexual), adaptation to receptors and overcoming some post-entry barriers (Gao et al., 1999; Heeney et al., 2006) . In human populations and individuals, HIV is rapidly evolving by mutations and recombination, making antiviral therapy a very difficult job.",

New human pathogenic viruses are usually originating from relatively low pathogenic animal viruses by changing host range (crossing interspecies barrier). They may become highly pathogenic in humans, in particular, because they, as unknown invaders, are met with a hyper-reactive defense reaction leading to extensive host damage, whereas the viruses carelessly employ in full their anti-defensive tools. Further rapid evolutionary rates may contribute to difficulty in combating these infections. On the other hand, long-term evolution of such viruses may lead to a decrease in their pathogenicity and human evolution may probably result in an increased resistance to such viruses.",
