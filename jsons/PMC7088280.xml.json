Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were obtained from all the patients.

In brief, RNA was extracted from 250 \u03bcl of each viral sample using Isogen-LS (NipponGene, Tokyo, Japan; an acid guanidinium thiocyanate kit). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 3 \u03bcl of resuspended RNA, using 2.5 U of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). A 10-\u03bcl aliquot of the cDNA product was the template in the amplification with Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin\u2013Elmer, Norwalk, CT). Primers targeted the 5\u2032 non-coated region of mumps virus and enterovirus sequences. A list of the primer sequences used is given in Table 2. The PCR product was run on a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide, and the gel was photographed under ultraviolet light. A positive PCR reaction was expected to produce a 223-base pair (bp) band for mumps virus and a 155-bp band for enterovirus. The sensitivity of PCR-FMU calculated from extraction of serial dilutions of titrated reference viruses was 10-2 TCID50 /ml for mumps virus, and 10-3 TCID50 /ml for enterovirus.\n",

            "text": "The mumps virus, a member of the Rubulavirus genus of the family Paramyxoviridae, consists of single-stranded negative-sense genomic RNA with a virion [28]. The virus usually causes a benign childhood infection. Parotitis is the most common clinical symptom, and the most common complication of infection is aseptic meningitis. Other central nervous system complications include acute and chronic encephalitis, transverse myelitis, hydrocephalus and acute cerebellar ataxia [27]. Transverse myelitis [29, 30] and optic neuritis [31], both symptoms of NMO, have been reported subsequent to mumps infection or mumps virus vaccination. Some reports have suggested an association of optic neuritis [22, 32] with mumps virus. Because patients with NMO often have optic neuritis or transverse myelitis as the initial symptom [12], cases of NMO might be included in those reports. No reports have described an association between NMO and mumps virus, but one case report has described a patient who presented transverse myelitis and optic neuritis after mumps virus meningoencephalitis [33].",
