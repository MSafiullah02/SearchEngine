A much steeper linear increase in minute ventilation is seen during hypercarbic challenge. Thus, for every 1 mmHg rise in pCO2, ventilation increases by 2.5\u20133 L/min. This normal predictable increase in minute ventilation in response to hypoxia and hypercapnea may be altered in certain neuromuscular disorders. In addition to a decrease in central neural drive, a blunted ventilatory response to hypoxia and/or hypercapnia may be related to other factors such as respiratory muscle dysfunction and/or abnormal chest wall and lung mechanics.Mouth occlusion pressure, or Pm100, is the maximum amount of negative pressure generated during early inspiration and is an index of central neural drive.A better test of the central respiratory drive, one that is independent of respiratory mechanics, is the mouth occlusion pressure, or Pm100. Pm100 refers to the maximum negative mouth pressure generated during the first 100 ms of inspiration with complete airway occlusion. Because the Pm100 is obtained during early inspiration with only a fraction of total inspiratory time, it is not influenced by a conscious alteration in respiration. Similarly, because the Pm100 is only a fraction of the maximum inspiratory muscle strength, the result may remain valid even in the presence of moderately severe respiratory muscle weakness.",

These patients can present in the ICU with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, which is often associated with community-acquired pneumonia. Since these patients do not have prior respiratory complaints, respiratory muscle weakness is often not suspected until difficulty weaning from the ventilator is encountered. In one study, 27% of patients with moderately advanced neuromuscular disease who had severe reductions in both inspiratory and expiratory muscle function had no prior respiratory complaints.4 In another report, 50% of patients with severe respiratory muscle weakness due to chronic neuromuscular disease were asymptomatic.5 It is unclear why respiratory muscle weakness correlates so poorly with patient reported symptoms.

Lung volume studies typically reveal a moderate reduction in total lung capacity and functional residual capacity with a normal or elevated residual capacity. A moderate fall in both inspiratory and expiratory reserve volume occurs. The decline in FVC is mainly caused by respiratory muscle weakness, and the decrease in FVC, in the absence of obstructive lung diseases, parallels the progression of the underlying respiratory muscle function. Thus, serial FVC measurement can be performed in the ICU setting to detect impending respiratory failure. However, a significant reduction in lung compliance may also contribute to decreased FVC in patients with chronic neuromuscular disease. The exact causes of reduced lung distensibility are unclear, but may be due to failed maturation of normal lung tissue in congenital neuromuscular diseases, the presence of micro or macroatelectasis increases in alveolar surface tension caused by breathing chronically at low tidal volumes, and alterations in lung tissue elasticity.",

Riluzole, an antiglutamate drug, is FDA-approved for the treatment of ALS. Riluzole is the only treatment that has been shown to prolong survival in ALS or mechanical ventilation by approximately 3 months. It should be given to patients once a diagnosis of ALS is made. Therefore, despite optimal medical therapy, disease progression invariably occurs, resulting in respiratory insufficiency requiring some form of ventilatory assistance. The onset of respiratory failure often signals a rapid decline in global functional status as well. The need for mechanical ventilation should be discussed by the clinician with the patient and family early on in the disease course to prevent a rapid decline in the clinical symptoms of respiratory failure due to a rapid decline in lung function. In a survey of ALS patients, patients with early disease are more receptive to long-term ventilatory support compared to patients with advanced disease. ALS patients who develop respiratory symptoms, or who have a moderate reduction in lung function or a rapid decline in lung function, should be offered noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) with techniques such as Biphasic (inspiratory and expiratory) positive airways pressure (BIPAP). In patients who can tolerate NPPV, the risk of death is decreased. In one study, 122 patients with ALS were offered BIPAP therapy once they developed dyspnea, or FVC less than 50%, or a fall of more than 15% in FVC in 3-month follow-up. Those patients who used BIPAP more than 4 h/day not only showed a slower decline in lung function, but also had decreased mortality rates.9\n",

A randomized controlled trial assessed the effect of noninvasive mechanical ventilation versus standard care on survival and quality of life in a cohort of patients with ALS. Ninety-two patients were randomly assigned to noninvasive ventilation or standard care when they developed orthopnea with MIP of <60% or in the presence of hypercarbia. NPPV improved survival and improved the quality of life in patients with no bulbar, or at most, only mild bulbar symptoms.10 In patients with severe bulbar symptoms, NPPV only improved the quality of life. In the ICU setting, NPPV should be tried first in ALS patients who experience acute-on-chronic respiratory insufficiency especially in the absence of significant bulbar symptoms. Patients with significant bulbar symptoms usually cannot tolerate NPPV because of difficulty handling oral secretions. Theophylline may improve respiratory muscle strength and can be used in the absence of tachyarrhythmias. In patients with ALS, theophylline improved the negative inspiratory pressure, FVC, and peak inspiratory flow by 28%, 10%, and 12%, respectively.11\n",

On routine pulmonary function testing, bilateral diaphragm paralysis reveals a restrictive ventilatory defect characterized by a decrease in FVC, RV, and TLC. The VC is typically reduced to less than 50% of that predicted in the erect posture and is further reduced in the recumbent posture. In the upright posture, contraction of the abdominal muscles during expiration and relaxation during early inspiration results in an outward motion of the abdomen and facilitates passive descent of the diaphragm. In the recumbent posture, diaphragm function is further impaired by the increase in the inspiratory workload imposed by cephalad displacement of the abdominal viscera. As in any other neuromuscular disease, chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure may be seen in moderate-to-severe bilateral diaphragm weakness.Elevated unilateral or bilateral diaphragms may be seen on chest X-ray.

A fluoroscopic technique to evaluate diaphragmatic excursion known as the sniff test is helpful to further evaluate the presence of diaphragm paralysis.

The sniff test is not useful in the evaluation of bilateral diaphragm paralysis and may result in an apparently false-normal study. A false negative test may result when both hemidiaphragms appear to descend normally during a sniff maneuver, despite profound weakness, due to a sudden relaxation of the abdominal muscles (i.e., passive inspiration). In addition, a positive sniff test should also be interpreted with caution because this can be seen in up to 6% of normal individuals.

Involvement of the bulbar and respiratory muscles may lead to swallowing dysfunction, increased risk of aspiration, and respiratory failure. Although the exact etiology is unknown, in approximately 70% of cases an antecedent viral or bacterial infection, 1\u20134 weeks prior to presentation, can be identified from the history. The current concept suggests that GBS is a self-limited, reactive autoimmune disease in which an aberrant immune response is directed against bacterial lipopolysaccharides that share similar epitopes with the myelin sheath or Schwann cell basement membrane. Viral infections associated with GBS include Cytomegalovirus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and Varicella-zoster virus. Cytomegalovirus is the most frequently identified viral infection; it has been documented to precede GBS in 11\u201322% of cases.12 In such cases, serologic testing may reveal positive anti-CMV immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody, high serum antibody titers to GM2 gangliosides or to sulfated glycolipids of peripheral myelin. GBS associated with CMV infections has the predilection to affect female and younger patients, and is commonly associated with facial and bulbar palsies, respiratory failure, and severe sensory loss. Campylobacter jejuni is the most frequent bacterial infection preceding the diagnosis of GBS. In 23\u201345% of sporadic cases of GBS, recent C. jejuni infections can be documented by serologic testing or bacterial culture. The actual risk of developing GBS following C. jejuni is 1 in 1,000, suggesting that host susceptibility plays an important role in the pathogenesis of GBS. Unlike GBS preceded by CMV infection, C. jejuni associated GBS often presents as pure motor axonal neuropathy, and seldom involves the cranial nerves. However, it can present as Miller-Fischer syndrome characterized by opthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia. Serum from such patients often contains high titers of antibodies against gangliosides. High serum GQ1b titer is considered pathognomonic of Miller-Fischer syndrome. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection is the second most common cause of bacterial infection linked to GBS occurring in approximately 5% of GBS cases. Some cases of GBS have been linked to influenza vaccination, recent surgery, trauma, and malignancy (lymphoma).Cytomegalovirus is the most common viral infection linked to GBS. Campylobacter jejuni infection is the most common bacterial infection associated with GBS.\nCMV-related GBS predominantly affects female and younger patients. Clinical presentation often includes facial and bulbar palsies, respiratory failure, and unusually severe sensory loss.\n\nC. jejuni-related GBS often present with pure motor axonal neuropathy, which often spares the cranial nerves.\n",

Serial FVC is the most useful test in predicting the need for mechanical ventilation and should be performed once or twice daily depending on the clinical condition of the patient. Figure 29-5 shows the changes in respiratory function with the progressive decline in FVC and its suggested treatment. Several studies have shown that a FVC of 12\u201315 mg/kg is a sign of imminent respiratory failure.13,14 In patients who develop respiratory failure due to Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, FVC measured serially decreased from a mean of 2.5\u20130.9 L within 2 weeks. In a recent study of 81 GBS patients who required mechanical ventilation, the average FVC at the time of intubation was 33 \u00b1 11%.13 Other indications for intubation and ventilatory support include respiratory distress, inability to handle oral secretions, hypoxemia (PaO2 < 70 mmHg on room air or alveolar\u2013arterial O2 difference >300 mmHg while inspiring 100% oxygen), and hypercapnia. Blood gas analysis is used to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Hypercapnia is a late sign of ventilatory failure and should not be relied upon as an indication for when to start mechanical ventilation. The average PaCO2 at the time of intubation when FVC is less than 12 mL/kg was 43 mmHg in two large series of GBS patients.13 Other predictors of the need for mechanical ventilation include time between onset of disease and hospital admission of \u22647 days, inability to lift head, presence of bulbar dysfunction, and the presence of anti-GQ1b antibodies.15-18 A recent study suggests that neurophysiological testing is helpful in predicting the need for mechanical ventilation. Of the 154 patients included in this study, patients with the demyelinating form of GBS required mechanical ventilation more often than patients with axonal or equivocal findings on electrophysiology.19 The risk of acute respiratory failure was only 2.5% if the proximal/distal compound muscular amplitude potential (p/dCMAP) ratio was >55.6% and a forced vital capacity was >81%.\n\n",

These include severe systemic inflammation especially due to sepsis, sepsis syndrome, multisystem organ failure, use of corticosteroids and neuromuscular blocking agents, hyperglycemia and hyperosmolality, immobility, use of aminoglycosides, and duration of mechanical ventilation. Indices that measure the severity of critical illness, such as the Acute Physiology, Age, and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III, or the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score (SOFA), are also important predictors of the occurrence of CIPNM.31 The detrimental effect of hyperglycemia on neuromuscular function is supported by a recent study showing that intensive insulin therapy to maintain normoglycemia (blood glucose levels between 80 and 110 mg/dL) decreases the incidence of critical illness polyneuropathy by 44% compared to conventional insulin therapy (blood glucose level between 180 and 200 mg/dL).32-35 In addition, the cases of CIPNM in the intensive insulin treatment group resolved faster. The risk of CIPNM was linearly correlated with the mean blood glucose level. In multivariate analysis, independent predictors of polyneuropathy include conventional insulin treatment (odds ratio 2.6; 95% confidence interval 1.6\u20134.2), vasopressor support of more than 3 days (odds ratio 2.5; 95% confidence interval 1.4\u20134.2), bacteremia (odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.3\u20134.1), and dialysis (odds ratio 1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.0\u20133.8). Similarly, intensive insulin therapy decreased the incidence of CIPNM in patients who required mechanical ventilation for more than 7 days in the medical ICU compared to conventional treatment with an absolute risk reduction of \u201311.6%. Moreover, the cumulative risk of CIPNM over time was also significantly reduced compared to conventionally treated patients, partially explaining the decrease in the duration of mechanical ventilation.36\nInsulin therapy to control hyperglycemia to euglycemic levels can decrease the risk of critical illness polyneuropathy.\nSepsis and multisystem organ failure are the two most common causes of acquired acute weakness syndrome in the ICU.\n",

Since the systemic inflammatory response and multisystem organ failure almost always precedes CIPNM, an exaggerated immune response to injury is thought to be the main pathogenic pathway leading to nerve and muscle injury. The resulting unmitigated systemic and local inflammatory response, in particular, the release of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1 and 12, and the recruitment of T-helper 1 cells, monocyte, macrophages, and neutrophils, leads to endothelial cell injury. This causes increased microvascular permeability and endoneural edema that decreases blood flow to the nerve and muscle tissue. The end result of this inflammatory cascade is primary axonal degeneration of the sensory and motor fibers and muscle atrophy with loss of contractile proteins and membrane inexcitability. An animal model of sepsis showed that sepsis triggers enhanced muscle protein proteolysis through the ubiquitin-proteosome and calpain system causing myofibillar degradation and disruption of the sarcomere. Recent studies suggest that critical illness myopathy is not only due to selective myosin loss, but also due to muscle fiber membrane electrical inexcitability caused by defective sodium channel regulation.37 Animal models of critical illness myopathy reveal altered membrane expression and function of the sodium channels.38\nCritical illness polyneuropathy should be suspected in patients who fail weaning from mechanical support, develop areflexic limbs weakness, or have a complicated ICU course as a result of sepsis.\n",

These patients usually have no prior history of neuropathy or myopathy. The muscle weakness is most prominent in the lower extremities and is accompanied by muscle wasting and reduced or absent tendon reflexes. Facial muscle weakness, presence of asymmetrical weakness of the limb, or pyramidal signs should prompt further workup to rule out other neurologic causes of weakness. Assessment of peripheral muscle strength can be difficult because of sedation, delirium, or the presence of metabolic encephalopathy. Nevertheless, if motor strength assessment is possible, a standardized muscle examination can be used to assess the degree of weakness in individual muscle groups. The Medical Research Council (MRC) Scale for muscle examination includes strength assessment of three different muscle groups on each limb and ranks them on a scale from 0 to 5 as seen in Table 29-11.23 The MRC score is easy to use, and reproducible even in mechanical ventilated patients. Three muscle functions are evaluated in the upper and lower limbs. Each function score ranges from 0, which denotes no detectable movement, to 5 denoting normal power. The total score ranges from 0 to 60. A score of less than 48 reflects significant weakness.\n",

The EMG finding in critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) is primary axonal polyneuropathy.The diagnosis of CINM can often be made based on typical clinical presentation. Nerve conduction studies and electromyography are useful in detecting the presence of sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy and associated myopathy. In axonal polyneuropathy, ENMG testing shows a reduction in the amplitude of the compound action potential with normal conduction velocity on motor nerve stimulation, and spontaneous electrical activity on muscle needle recording. This EMG pattern can be seen in 70\u2013100% of ICU with severe sepsis and after 5\u20137 days of mechanical ventilation. A myopathic pattern on ENMG is suggested by the presence of a prolonged compound muscle action potential and a short duration and low amplitudes of motor unit potentials on voluntary activation. Creatine phosphokinase levels (CPK) are either normal or slightly elevated in CIPNM. Muscle and nerve biopsy can be used to confirm the diagnosis, but are not routinely indicated. Muscle biopsy usually shows type II fiber atrophy and occasionally type I atrophy and muscle necrosis. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy show a loss of myosin thick filaments. In the right clinical setting, extensive neurologic testing or biopsy of the nerve or muscle are not required to make a confident diagnosis of CIPNM.

A positive Tensilon test highly suggests myasthenia gravis, but a positive test has also been reported in patients with Lambert\u2013Eaton syndrome, botulism, and ALS. In patients with moderately generalized myasthenia gravis, pulmonary function testing reveals a mild reduction in FVC and a moderate reduction in both inspiratory and expiratory strength, indicating respiratory muscle weakness. Treatment with pyridostigmine, both available in IV and tablet formulation, may improve FVC, MIP, and MEP, although respiratory muscle strength does not normalize. As in other chronic neuromuscular diseases, the breathing pattern is rapid and shallow. Arterial blood gas examination is frequently normal even with severe impairment of transdiaphragmatic pressures (P\ndi). Arterial blood gases are, therefore, not useful in monitoring the severity of respiratory muscle dysfunction.",

Approximately 15\u201320% of myasthenia gravis patients will experience myasthenic crises, often within the first year of illness. Thymomas are associated with a more fulminate course of MG and are present in one third of patients who experienced myasthenic crises. Acute respiratory failure has been reported as the initial presentation of MG.45 The most common causes of myasthenic crises are respiratory infections (including aspiration) and surgery. Other precipitating factors include discontinuation or decreased dosage of anticholinergic or immune modulating medications, or the administration of new medications that precipitate MG. Commonly used medications such as corticosteroids, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones class of antibiotics, neuromuscular blocking agents, and neuropsychiatric drugs may precipitate myasthenic crises and should be avoided if possible. The initiation of corticosteroid therapy can paradoxically cause a transient increase in muscle weakness during the first or second week of therapy, especially in patients with severe bulbar symptoms and generalized myasthenia gravis. Cholinergic crisis due to excessive dosing of an anticholinesterase medication can mimic myasthenic crisis; this is thought to be due to a depolarization blockade at the neuromuscular junction. Other clinical signs of cholinergic crisis that are not present in myasthenic exacerbations include the presence of muscarinic symptoms such as miosis, hypersalivation, increased bronchial secretions, bradycardia, gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), sweating, and muscle fasciculation. The Tensilon test has been used routinely in the past to differentiate myasthenic from cholinergic crises. However, this practice is currently not recommended because of the potential for respiratory arrest due to cholinergic weakness and increased secretions and mucus plugging, especially in patients with renal insufficiency. Moreover, it is now common practice to avoid dose escalation of cholinergic agents during myasthenic crises, to discontinue the use of cholinesterase inhibitors following intubations, and to reduce muscarinic complications.Cholinergic crisis is a worsening of the neurologic symptoms of myasthenia gravis due to an excess of anticholinesterase medications.\n",

Both maximum static pressures and MVV correlated with clinical worsening of myasthenia gravis in a relatively stable outpatient setting. The dosing schedule of anticholinesterase medications will affect the measurement of these respiratory parameters. The maximum improvement in respiratory muscle strength occurs about 2 h after the drug is given and slowly declines until the next dose is given. Consequently, FVC, PImax, and PEmax should be measured 30 min before the next dose of anticholinesterase agents. When FVC is below 15 mL/kg and the maximum static respiratory pressures are less than \u00b130 cm, assisted ventilation is likely required. No single respiratory parameter reliably predicts the need for mechanical ventilation. Other clinical signs of impending respiratory failure include upper airway obstruction due to vocal cord paralysis or the inability to handle oropharyngeal secretions due to severe bulbar involvement. Flow\u2013volume loops may show variable extrathoracic airway obstruction with the characteristic inspiratory plateau. Bilateral basal atelectasis on chest radiograph signifies poor clearance of airway secretions due to a weak cough and is often accompanied by a rapid shallow breathing pattern.

Anticholinesterase agents are the first line of treatment. Although anticholinesterase agents do not alter the natural course of the disease, most patients improve significantly with this treatment, but only a few patients regain normal function. Remission can be induced in up to 80% of patients with corticosteroids. However, initiation of corticosteroids therapy may cause temporary worsening of muscle weakness, usually on the 6th to 10th day of therapy. Thymectomy has also been shown to improve survival and clinical symptoms in patients with myasthenia gravis compared to patients who were treated medically, even in the absence of thymoma. Thymectomy can lead to clinical improvement and myasthenia gravis remission even in the absence of thymoma. Thymectomy is indicated in young patients (<55 years old) and in patients with thymoma because of the risk of malignant transformation. Because there are no randomized controlled studies documenting the benefit of thymectomy in myasthenia gravis, and given the presence of confounding variables such as age, gender, and severity of myasthenia gravis, the American Academy of Neurology recommends thymectomy in patients with nonthymomatous autoimmune myasthenia gravis only as an option to increase the probability of remission or improvement.",

Noninvasive mechanical ventilation is an alternative ventilatory strategy in patients with severe myasthenia crises with early respiratory failure even in the presence of bulbar symptoms. In a retrospective study of 60 episodes of acute respiratory failure in 52 patients, bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and invasive mechanical ventilation were the initial method of ventilatory support in 24 and 36 episodes acute respiratory failure, respectively. In the BiPAP group, 14 (58%) were successfully treated with BiPAP alone and 10 eventually required invasive mechanical ventilation.49 The use of BiPAP avoids the need for airway intubation, decreases the duration of mechanical ventilation, and decreases both ICU and hospital length-of-stay. The only predictor of failure of using NPPV to initially treat respiratory failure in MG was a PaCO2 of >45 mmHg. Thus, NPPV should be used early in acute respiratory failure before the onset of hypercapnia. In patients who required invasive ventilatory support, aggressive respiratory management including the use of sighs, positive end expiratory pressure, frequent suctioning, chest physiotherapy, turning in bed, and the use of antibiotics decreased the prevalence of both atelectasis and bronchopneumonia.50 Weaning trials can be initiated once an improvement in respiratory status is documented. This includes a maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) < \u221220 cmH2O, maximum expiratory pressure > 40 cmH2O, and FVC > 10 mL/kg.51 In a retrospective study of 46 episodes of acute respiratory failure due to myasthenia gravis, extubation failure defined as the need for reintubation, or tracheostomy and death while on the ventilator occurred in 44% of cases.

Those patients who had lower pH, lower FVC, the presence of atelectasis, and the need for BiPAP support had a higher risk for reintubation.52 These data suggest that other factors such as respiratory muscle fatigue, the presence bulbar weakness, and the inability to handle upper airway secretions are not measured by standard weaning parameters and should be considered before attempting extubation.",

Steroid myopathy usually presents subacutely as proximal limb weakness, although high-dose corticosteroid therapy can induce clinically important weakness within 2 weeks of therapy. High-dose glucocorticoids given in conjunction with neuromuscular blocking agents may lead to critical illness myopathy as previously discussed (see 10.1007/978-0-387-77452-7_58). Myopathy can occur with any glucocorticosteroid preparation, but is unusual in patients treated with less than 10 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent. Muscle enzymes are usually normal. EMG is either normal or reveals slight myopathic changes. In contrast to critical illness myopathy, a steroid-induced myopathy biopsy usually shows loss of type IIa muscle fibers with no evidence of inflammation or fiber necrosis. There is poor correlation between the total dose of steroids administered and the severity of muscle weakness. However, a gradual improvement in muscle strength follows discontinuation or reduction of administered corticosteroids.Acute myopathy is the most common acquired neuromyopathy in the ICU.\nRisk factors for the development of acute ICU myopathy include sepsis, multisystem organ failure, and prolonged use of neuromuscular drugs.\nCharacteristics of chronic steroid myopathy include proximal muscle weakness, normal muscle enzymes, mild myopathic changes on EMG, and loss of type IIa muscle fiber on muscle biopsy.\n",

Some features that are available on standard ventilators that are useful in the acute clinical setting are the ability to monitor respiratory pattern and to supply variable amounts of enriched oxygen. In patients with acute or chronic respiratory failure who are otherwise hemodynamically stable, small pressure-limited, flow- or time-cycled portable ventilators (bilevel positive airway pressure) have been used with success. These devices are particularly useful in partial chronic ventilator support in patients with progressive neuromuscular dysfunction once the acute illness that requires ICU care has resolved.",

The expiratory airway pressure on BIPAP is usually set at 4 cm to ensure continuous flow of gas during expiration, thereby flushing out the expired gas. If supplemental oxygen is required, oxygen tubing is connected to the ventilator tubing using a T-connector. The expiratory airway pressure may also be titrated up to increase FRC and improve gas exchange. The initial duration of ventilatory assistance depends on the severity of respiratory failure and patient tolerance. In an acute setting, ventilatory assistance of 20 h/day may be needed. In a chronic setting, we allow the patient to use NPPV during the daytime for a few hours, followed by nocturnal use of 6\u20138 h once they are accustomed to NPPV.",

In patients with rapidly worsening respiratory weakness, FVC less than 12\u201315 mL/kg indicates impending respiratory failure and the need to initiate ventilatory support. Other indications for ventilatory support include upper airway dysfunction, abnormal gas exchange, and hemodynamic instability. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation may be used to provide partial ventilatory support in neuromuscular patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure who are awake, cooperative, hemodynamically stable, and with preserved upper airway function. The prognosis of patients with neuromuscular dysfunction who require ICU admission depends on the type and clinical stage of the neuromuscular disease, the nature of the precipitating illness, and the therapeutic response of the patient to medical interventions. In many cases of neuromuscular disorder, therapy is primarily supportive; avoidance of complications arising from the chronic illness is also crucial to patient recovery.",

            "text": "ANSWERS\nThe answer is E. Serial measurement of FVC is a useful test to detect impending acute respiratory failure. Early intubation should be strongly considered once the FVC is < 12 mL/kg. other signs of impending respiratory failure include severe bulbar symptoms, inability to hold the head up, hypoxemia, and inability to handle oral secretions. The presence of anti-GQ1b and demyelinating form of GBS have also been reported as predictors of acute respiratory failure.The answer is C. Except for some form of congenital myopathies, central respiratory is usually normal or slightly elevated in patients with neuromuscular disease. There is a linear increase in minute ventilation with every 1% decrease in oxyhemoglobin or 1 mmHg increase in PaCO2. The linear relationship between hypercapnia and minute ventilation can be used to assess central respiratory drive. However, significant respiratory muscle weakness makes the test inaccurate. P100, by measuring the pressure generated very early during the inspiratory effort, is a more accurate test of the central respiratory drive since it is unaffected by the degree of respiratory muscle weakness.The answer is D. Aminoglycosides may potentiate muscle weakness in susceptible patients with neuromuscular disorders. Acquired weakness in the ICU is most commonly the result of acute myopathy and critical illness polyneuropathy. Risk factors commonly associated with these conditions are sepsis, multisystem organ failure, shock, and prolonged use of neuromuscular blocking agents, especially in the presence of renal and hepatic failure.The answer is E. Plasmapheresis is the treatment of choice in patients experiencing myasthenic crisis. IVIG can be used in lieu of plasmapheresis in patients who have hemodynamic instability or difficulty with central venous access. It is prudent to discontinue the anticholinergic agent during myasthenic crisis because of the possibility of concomitant cholinergic crisis. Corticosteroids can cause paradoxical weakness 5\u20137 days after starting corticosteroid treatment and should be withheld until clinical improvement is documented following plasmapheresis. NPPV decreases the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, and decrease the duration of ICU and hospitalization.The answer is E. All have been identified as risk factors in ICU-acquired weakness. Approximately 70 to as high as 100% of patients with sepsis develop varying degrees of critical illness polyneuropathy. Prolonged use of mechanical ventilation; the need for vasopressor support for more than 3 days. Aggressive control of stress-induced hyperglycemia with intravenous insulin therapy has been done to decrease the incidence of critical illness polyneuropathy.\n",
