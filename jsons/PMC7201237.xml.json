With very high polarization, large, separate clusters of the population endorse ideologically consistent stances across all issues, and love their own party while loathing the other(s).",

In the last half century, members of both parties have reported increasingly extreme ideological views [8], a trend more pronounced among Republicans than Democrats, especially in the last decade [9, 10, 11]. More than ever, Americans endorse their party\u2019s stance across all issues [7]. Since the 1990s, Americans\u2019 liking for their own party and dislike for opponents have both increased [5\u2022,12]. For example, 80% of Americans today feel unfavorable towards their partisan foes, and the portion feeling very unfavorable has nearly tripled since 1994 [13]. These trends have led scholars to speculate that politics is a unique intergroup domain wherein people\u2019s hate for opponents exceeds their affinity for co-partisans [12,14].",

It encourages civic engagement: Polarized citizens more often vote, protest, and join political movements, all of which are necessary for functioning democracy [15] and help disrupt undesirable status quos [16]. Polarization also entails pluralistic policy alternatives [17]; this is crucial for democracies, which rely on citizens being able to consider multiple policies and have thorough, constructive debates between them [18]. Ideally, this kind of engagement and pluralism ultimately produce effective, stable government: It helps societies identify policies that are both optimal for solving their biggest problems [89], and unlikely to be overturned when a new party takes power since they are mutually agreed-upon [85].",

For example, if one half of a society begins to embrace morally abhorrent ideas (i.e., white supremacy; Neo-Nazi ideologies), the other half might be justified in polarizing away from them, refusing to engage with or consisder their views. A full philosophical discussion of the morality of polarization falls beyond the scope of this paper (see Refs. [20, 21, 22]). Nonetheless, in a world where one half of a population refuse to engage with the other, even if this is the most morally correct choice, democratic processes can no longer operate effectively [23,24]. The only policies considered are those loved by one party and despised by the other; one side eventually ekes out a narrow victory, leaving the other desperate to delegitimize it [25].
