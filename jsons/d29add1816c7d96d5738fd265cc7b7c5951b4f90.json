As of February 13, 2020, over 59,000 confirmed cases of the 2019 novel coronavirus infection in China have been reported, and more than 440 cases in many other countries, with an approximately 2% mortality rate 2 . Evidence pointing to the person-to-person transmission in hospital and family settings has been accumulating, but the modes of transmission are incompletely defined, with no effective treatments or vaccines till now 3-5 . According to the previous studies [6] [7] [8] [9] , pregnant women are at high risk of developing viral infection, such as influenza-A, H1N1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and Ebola virus, and appear to have worse clinical outcomes including maternal mortality, stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, and preterm delivery compared to non-gravid women. However, there is only limited data about the clinical features of COVID-19 during pregnancy. In this study, we reported a case of a 30-week pregnant woman with COVID-19 and gave birth a baby with no evidence of COVID-19.",

She disclosed that she had returned to Suzhou on January 24 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan 3 weeks ago. Given the patient's travel history and fever, two throat swab samples were collected and tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended Kit (BioGerm, Shanghai, China), following WHO guidelines for quantitative RT-PCR. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan on February 4 demonstrated left-sided subpleural patchy consolidation and right-sided ground-glass opacities ( Figure A) . Then she went into isolation at that hospital. On February 6, the second SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results of her sputum came back positive, so she was then transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) in a negative pressure isolation room of the Affiliated Infectious Hospital of Soochow University, the designated medical center for COVID-19 in Suzhou.",

Treatment with Arbidol (0.2g administered orally every 8 hours), Lopinavir and Ritonavir Tablets (400/100mg administered orally every 8 hours), Cefoperazone Sodium and Sulbactam Sodium (3.0g administered intravenously every 8 hours), and Human Serum Albumin (20g administered intravenously every day) were initiated, dexamethasone and magnesium sulphate as prophylaxis for the fetus were given and an emergency cesarean section was prepared. On hospital day 3 morning (February 8), a repeated chest CT scan showed bilateral multiple ground-glass opacities ( Figure B) , a finding consistent with severe atypical pneumonia. In the afternoon, this patient had disappeared fetal movement and no variability of fetal heart rate monitoring, and no improvement was made on maximal ventilator support for four hours.",

A preterm male infant weighing 1.83 kg was delivered uneventfully, with Apgar scores of 9 and 10 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. And he was kept in the isolation ICU of the neonatal nursery for observation without any contact with his mother after birth. The newborn was given formula instead of breast milk ever since. During the delivery, samples of amniotic fluid, placenta, umbilical cord blood, gastric juice and throat swabs of the infant were obtained for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests, and all results were negative. On day 3 after cesarean section (February 11), RT-PCR analyses of the neonatal throat swab and stool samples were negative. On February 15 and 17, throat swab RT-PCR tests of the mother and the infant were negative.

First of all, this patient was a healthy young woman without special medical history, and regular follow-ups in obstetrics clinic reveled that she and the fetus were healthy before this infection. And early detection of COVID-19 and late stage of gestation were also essential. Secondly, our medical center was a designated hospital for COVID-19 in Suzhou since the virus outbreak in China, and all the health care workers received systemic training for strict isolation and protection measures, such as use of protective equipment, hand hygiene, safe waste management, environmental cleaning, and sterilization of medical equipment, and followed the correct procedures during medical practice. Much experience has been accumulating in the past few weeks from dozens of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2, including a 19-month old boy, the youngest patient in Suzhou to date. The patient in our case was ideally cared for by a multidisciplinary medical team, including obstetrics, pediatrics, infectious diseases, anesthesia, ICU, nosocomial infection control expert, and administrative staff. Timely and effective consultations were obtained to discuss her case. Last but not least, careful transmission precautions to the infant, including contact, droplet, and airborne seem to be of great significance. Given the high infectivity and undefined transmission mode, some infection-control protocols applicable for the operating room were developed for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Some infected cases in China demonstrated viral shedding in feces, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 might be present in other body parts, so those precautions during delivery were necessary in case transmission during delivery exists.",
