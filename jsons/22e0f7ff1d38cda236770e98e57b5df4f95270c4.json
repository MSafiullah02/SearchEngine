That is, whilst the approach may well offer a therapeutically life-saving solution for transplant patients facing end stage organ failure, it potentially provides a means of transferring contagious diseases across species barriers. Such xenozoonotic events can be potentially devastating within a species not immunitarily prepared to cope with exposure to novel non-endogenous pathogens. There is a profoundly troubling contradictory paradox here. The more effort taken to level or reduce immunitary differences between species, in order for such therapies to be possible, the greater the likelihood of transpecies infectivity.",

To what extent is it possible to re-engineer immunitary differences between humans and other species in order to radically increase access to compatible tissues, cells and organs? What measures are considered necessary, and by whom, to restrict and limit the potential for transpecies disease outbreaks? What lifestyle and biosecurity restrictions, including abstinence from unprotected sex, social isolation, can reasonably be placed on the human recipients of animal-based transplant therapies? How might it be possible to produce 'disease free' source animals through practical biosecurity measures including, for example, sterile confinement, sanitary isolation, birth by hysterectomy, and so on? Under what kinds of circumstances does it become possible to declare that another animal's tissues pose no threat, that they are clean, pure and free from contagion? When a non-human tissue is transplanted into a human, what are the implications of assuming that the tissues remain discrete, separate and apart immunitarily from the bodies into which they are transplanted? Or that the boundaries between the human recipient and the animal remain secure? The answers to these questions are necessarily highly contingent and partial. Nevertheless, as Esposito points out, 'never before have we had such an accurate perception of this community of bodies\u2026 the endless contagion that combines, overlaps, soaks, coagulates, blends and clones them' (2011, 151) .",

As we have seen, for Derrida, autoimmunity is a surplus, the excess that emerges from those measures we institute against risks yet to be realised.

For Derrida, catastrophic events linger on the horizon, in the dystopian imaginary, but guiding actions in the present. Systems of protection, the logics of securitisation, proportionally reflect these imaginaries. So, for example, what might it mean to place trust in, or have confidence in, biosecurity measures that make the realisation of a threat (pandemics, xenozoonotic disease outbreaks, etc.) more possible, not less so? To what extent is immunitary innovation, flow and mobility across species boundaries at the centre of a new regulatory politics of biosecurity? To what extent are guarantees of biosecurity premised on beliefs in the workable attainability of pathogenfree purity? And how do the balances between purity and impurity, cleanliness and pollution, play out across the biotechnological re-engineering of species-specific immunological boundaries?",

Nancy's experience of 'intrusion' is probably, Esposito writes, 'the most radical and at the same time the most sobering state of awareness regarding the meaning of the technicity of one's body ' (2011, 151-2) . Nancy is famously unromantic and ambivalent about the sentiments of mutual solidaristic reciprocity that are now somehow supposed to connect him to his donor. He is instead preoccupied with his own loss, with the loaded debt of the recipient. L'Intrus is uniquely experienced by the recipient rather than the 'donor'. Communitas becomes an intrusion, an incursion into the very corporeal fabric of the recipient's body: 'the whole dubious symbolism of the gift of the other-a secret, ghostly complicity or intimacy between the other and me-wears out very quickly ' (2008, 166) .",

Instead, the role of an affirmative immunitary analysis lies in recovering the intimately entwined intrusion of one upon the other.

Christian Bernard performs the first 'successful' heart transplantation in late 1967 and repeated the following year in a far more contentious expression of apartheid racial biopolitics. The recipient, a European Jewish dentist, is transplanted with the heart of Clive Haupt, a legally designated 'coloured' twenty-four-year-old male. It is deeply significant that the white recipient had to give specific consent given that the heart in question was not 'white'. Nor could it be guaranteed that the heart in question was straightforwardly 'human', given that Haupt's ancestry might conceivably be traced to the 'Hottentot'.

A now infamous intervention by a member of the Nationalist Party made just this point: 'The relief of suffering knows no colour bar\u2026 The heart is merely a blood-pumping machine and whether it comes from a white, black or coloured man-or a baboon or giraffe, for that matter-has no relevance to the issue of race relations in the political or ideological context. The question of colour is not at issue here' (Malan 1968, 115 ; see also Imma 2011) .",

There is also something deeply significant here in the fact that Barnard would briefly, a decade later, experiment with xenotransplantation. In 1977, he reported transplanting a middle-aged male with the heart of a chimpanzee and a young woman with a baboon's heart (Barnard et al. 1977 ; see also Fox and Swazey 1992, 213; Cooper 2001) .",

            "text": "But the point to take from the Haupt event is the way processes of socio-cultural othering and distancing paradoxically make way for immunitary entanglement and interpenetration. The biopolitical event of Haupt's transplantation across the racial bar marks a moment of paradox. But it is also an event made possible and legitimised because of the way social community and biological immunity are made to depart from one another. The former sustains a striation of biopolitical difference unequally segregating and demarcating members of the community. The latter, biological immunity, introduces a new register of sameness. This cleaving apart of politics from biology occurs in such a way that the immunitary similarity of transplantation comes to depend upon the biopolitical segmentation of community. For Opondo, the Haupt event is expressed through a complex 'dialectics' between otherwise opposed dimensions of sameness and difference, between immunity and community, between the indispensable and the expendable: the imperative to save specific human lives and the recognition of the entanglement of human lives erases certain bodily boundaries while enabling forms of bodily fragmentation, appropriation, and commodification that create a \"sense of ontological insecurity\" for those whose bodies are considered a reservoir of spare parts or a depository or conduit for trial drugs. (2015, 9) It is then, in these terms, that immunitary life becomes and makes possible an interlocking dynamics of utility and even exploitability within the new economies of tissue transplantation. Scheper-Hughes (2002) makes much of the emergence of a 'medical apartheid' that globally differentiates between structurally and racially located bodies, some of whom become a 'source' for tissue beneficiaries. Organ trafficking and transplant tourism globally extends the way biologically defined immunitary wholes come to depend on segmented communitary parts. One expresses an immunitary universalism cutting across socially and economically entrenched racial divisions. The other articulates the communitary segmentation separating North from South and advantage from disadvantage. In the highly polarised economies of advanced global capitalism, very few are positioned to take advantage of the differences of value to which the majority are oppressively subject.",

The 'price' paid varied between 1200 and 1600 US dollars for kidneys bought for a mere fraction of that value from mainly Romanian and Brazilian nationals. It goes almost without saying that the case expresses many of the undercurrents of what Scheper-Hughes chooses to call gourmet 'neo-cannibalism'.

But the crucial point for this analysis of immunitary life is to better understand the pragmatic separation of immunity from community, the biomedical from the biopolitical. It is also critical to understand the way in which this separation is subsequently redeployed in the advancement of sometimes culturally troubling immunitary biosciences. Immunological innovation in transplantation and related fields is one fundamentally characterised by, within certain limits, a qualified erasure of difference, the creation of a kind of questionable commonness. Transplantation is continually cited as illustrative of this blurring of immunitary boundaries between bodies and across species. When Tauber (1998) writes of the ascendency of a more dynamic and permeable perspective on the immune system in immunology, he rightly cites the influence of 1970s and 1980s transplant 'pioneers' like Tom Starzl amongst others. Fittingly for the discussion that follows below, Starzl played a leading early role in championing the promise and potential of xenotransplantation using non-human primates, pigs and other species. The idea that 'we' now share a new inter-humanness or interspeciesness is a pervasive, but not unproblematic, trope in the immunitary biosciences and in biopolitical scholarship. That levelling rips its way through, for example, metric discourse in genomics in which other species are said to share x-number of genes or mutations or whatever with humans (see Marks 2003; Holmberg 2005; Brown 2009 ).",

The use of Haupt's heart to extend the life of Blaiberg should not, Imma (2011, 143) warns us, 'be read as the dramatic demise of scientific racism', as some had optimistically suggested. Rather than shaking the very foundations of apartheid, it arguably made the unthinkable more possible. Of the Haupt event, Opondo (2015) usefully points to Esposito's reflections on a modern immunitary paradigm which ultimately dehumanises through the fusion of the human and with other species. We might usefully think of this as a process of biopolitical 'beasting' (Brown 2009) or 'bestialising' (Esposito 2011, 81) in which immunitas plays a role in reducing life to its bareness, to raw matter (Agamben 1998) . As beasting progresses, 'humanitas' becomes the untainted remnant or exclusive residual purity left over once the vast majority of the world has been designated impure: Nazism itself never renounced the category humanitas \u2026 more than 'bestializing' man, as is commonly thought, it 'anthropologized' the animal enlarging the definition of anthropos to the point where it comprised animals of inferior species. He who was the subject of persecution and extreme violence wasn't simply an animal \u2026 but was an animal-man: man in the animal and the animal in man. (Esposito 2008a , 111 in Opondo 2015 The traffic in tissues between bodies and between species clearly incites hybrid anxieties in which categorical differences collide in newly embodied realities. That potential for pollution becomes more acutely profound in the shift from allotransplantation (between the human) to xenotransplantation (between humans and non-humans). But the point being made in much of the critical sociological commentary is that there are strong cross-currents between racism and speciesism in the political and moral economies through which transplantation has developed.",

Questions of sameness and difference, for me, articulate themselves most strongly in debates about which source species would be more appropriate than another for transplantation into humans. What I called the 'which species debate' in the science and policy of xenotransplantation focused, at various times, on a number of closely or distantly related species including varieties of primates, pigs and other species. Themes of species desirability and undesirability remain enduring biopolitical issues in the still advancing fields of transpecies biomedicine (Cook 2013) .

Xenotransplantation also extends and focuses long-standing controversies about the use of animals as model proxies for humans in medical research, let alone as novel sources of immunologically 'humanised' cells, organs, tissues and biodevices. In historical terms, dating back centuries even, humans have been the recipients of blood and tissues from an eclectic menagerie of animals including other primates and 'higher' simians (apes, baboons, macaques, rhesus monkeys, chimpanzees, etc.) and 'domesticated' animals (guinea pigs, dogs, rabbits, goats, sheep, cows and pigs, etc.).",

This fundamental requirement for sameness relies on certain relations of species affinity, possibly even some kind of ancestral resemblance and 'kinship' amongst relatively distant or proximal evolutionary 'cousins'. And yet, it is that very requirement for similarity and sameness that brings xenotransplantation into conflict with cultural norms forbidding the 'exploitation' of animals 'like us' or animals which are 'human-like'. What often makes animals 'useful' or usable are those attributes that are seen to distance them from 'us', animals whose anthropomorphic status is less secure.

Chimpanzees were used in a number of kidney transplants in 1963 performed by Hitchcock and Reemtsma, and in the very first heart transplantation performed in 1964 by Hardy. With poor evidence of therapeutic efficacy, xenotransplantation procedures dropped away considerably from the late 1960s and into the early 1980s. It is however important not to lose sight of the extent to which the politics of race continues to define xenotransplantation throughout this period (see Opondo 2015; Kierans 2015) . With parallels to Barnard's work in South Africa, much of the early work on xenotransplantation takes place in the Southern states of the US especially Virginia, Mississippi and Louisiana. Reemtsma's early clinical transplantation work was conducted at Tulane in Louisiana where it could be argued both primates (chimpanzees) and black patients were seen to share an adjacent cultural locus as experimental objects. Implicit in a number of programmes was the idea that therapeutic success would be more likely between non-whites and primates than with Caucasoids. As Sharp points out, 'vulnerable Blacks apparently served at key moments as human species proxies during the provisional and transitional testing of inter-species kinship. If a chimp's heart or kidneys could function in a black body, perhaps these organs might function in the bodies of any human being' (Sharp 2011, 26) . Reemtsma was also institutionally located at a charity hospital where there was a much greater likelihood of treating deprived black populations.",

You see, I don't believe in evolution' (Gould 1988) . For the evolutionary biologist Stephen J. Gould, Bailey's 'chilling' remark highlighted profound confusion in what it means to be evolutionarily 'homologous' or merely 'similar'. For Gould, the very idea of homology fell between at least two meanings. For biochemists, it meant sharing similar sequences of DNA. But for evolutionary biologists, it meant descendance from a common ancestor. It is, he writes, the 'quality of relationships based on evolutionary descent' that should be taken as the measure of our relationships to other species (ibid., 30). Genetic homology was not, he argued, the same as evolutionary homology. Bailey, Gould suggested, had confused mere 'similarity' with 'homology', mistakenly placing trust in genetics over that of evolution. More polemically, Gould pointed out that just because 'birds, bats, and pterodactyls all bear wings with common aerodynamic properties', it does not follow that they share an ancestry (ibid.). More obviously, 'the greater the evolutionary distance between two species' he wrote, 'the less the hope that a xenograft can survive rejection' (ibid.).",

Success would come to depend, it was argued, on the closest possible immunitary and evolutionary homology between source and recipient species. It is this naturalised biological affinity which makes other simians so compelling in the twentieth century scientific imaginary (Haraway 1989) . Simians are thus positioned, in the physiological and behavioural disciplines, as proxies par excellence for humans. The very legitimacy and success of those enterprises comes to rest equally upon the erasure of difference and the assertion of sameness. It is that very same 'proximal imaginary' in the wider natural sciences that guides and structures the simian species preferences of xenotransplantation into the 1980s.",

I want to explore this further below, but this sense of being too close is not at all confined to cultural or moral transgression. One of the key developments that negatively defines the use of other primates in xenotransplantation arises in response to increasing knowledge of the etiological origins of AIDS/HIV.

In 1995, the AIDS patient Jeff Getty is transplanted with the bone marrow cells of a baboon in an attempt to reinvigorate his failing immune system. Putting aside the pejorative references to 'baboon boy' in the press (Cooper and Lanza 2000, 201) , baboon haematopoietic stem cells were known to be resistant to HIV infection. In other words, what made the approach conceivably possible were the very same homological differences that had made Bailey's baboon transplant impossible. Both events sparked increasing awareness amongst virologists beyond the worlds of clinical transplantation that xenografting might in fact replicate the very same species intimacies that had given rise to HIV in the first place. As one of the key virologists in the debate put it: 'simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) appear to have low if any pathogenicity in their natural African primate hosts, but lead to fatal acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in Asian macaques and, sadly, after adaptation to become HIV in humans' (Weiss et al. 2000) .",

As I note above, it is critical to understand the way in which fascination about other primates in twentieth century natural history and behavioural sciences is that which also makes them so obviously both attractive and problematic as experimental objects and sources of tissues and organs. Apes and monkeys embody the rehearsal of humanness itself in both popular and expert representation (Strum and Latour 1987; Haraway 1989; Schubert and Masters 1991) . Indeed, primate imaginaries, as Haraway notes, routinely involve the rehearsal of cultural concerns surrounding race, segregation, class, gender and social taboo. Much of the biomedical discourse surrounding the problematic use of other primates in xenotransplantation refers to their rich emotional lives, their complex sociality, and so on. One of the first influential advisory reports on xenotransplantation makes the point that other primates share many of 'the features qualifying human beings for person-hood\u2026 including self-awareness, complex social relationships and many of the other characteristics that have often been supposed to make human beings unique' (Nuffield 1996, 39) .

By the late 1990s, a growing number of regulatory authorities were placing greater restrictions on the use of other primates in biomedicine. However, debates about species desirability are also shaped by the fact that other primates are also unfamiliar and seldom encountered directly. Very rarely do they become companions, pets or sources of meat. Instead, our 'closest cousins' occupy a distantly remote mythical space in our interspecies imaginary. For this reason, the Nuffield report (1996) drew a distinction between 'relatedness' and 'relationship'. In other words, relationships or affinity with other species does not necessarily follow from being related or evolutionarily linked to them. The moral communitas of the human might be expected to apply more directly to other baboons and chimpanzees. But, the report pointed out, we may instead 'be more ready to include familiar, domestic animals than unfamiliar primates, even though the latter are much closer to human beings in a biological sense ' (ibid., 42) . The patterning of closeness is always therefore situated and context-dependent upon relationships in which it is conceivable that some animals, like pets, 'or indeed farm animals such as pigs, may well seem more person-like than baboons or chimpanzees' (ibid.). Having explored this patterning of sameness and difference in the context of humans and other simians, I now want to pursue the field as it turns towards pigs as a potentially desirable tissue source.",

What is fascinating here is the constant rehearsal of the case for pigs, the incessant need to explain, justify, rationalise and defend. It is this uninterrupted rearticulation that is at once a witness to deeper ambivalence about the place of pigs as ongoing sites of cultural and scientific risk. In what follows, it becomes possible to see into the intense material and discursive work still required to diffuse or normalise those risks. Again, what is most significant is the creation of a particular contrasting patterning of sameness and difference constructed between pigs and humans. In the first place, a shared immunitas, or sameness-making, between source and recipient species has come to depend on a natural/scientific/functional repertoire. But at the same time, a cultural, social or moral repertoire of difference-making is intended to exile the pig from the communitas of the human.",

In both material and discursive terms, pigs have been bred and domesticated over millennia to have a considerable body mass making them anatomically not dissimilar to humans. They are represented therefore as 'about the right size morphologically' and 'physiologically' in comparison to the smaller anatomies of baboons and chimpanzees. Processes of rapid reproductive domestication have resulted in frequent cycles of breeding with large litters. They therefore lend themselves to biotechnology's requirements for an accelerated accumulation of 'breedwealth' (Franklin 1997) over relatively short generational durations. That accumulation extends to the creation of particular 'designer' immunities, the 'humanisation' of a 'generation' of chimera human-porcine bodies. It even becomes theoretically possible to breed litters to exhibit particular patient-specific immune system characteristics, and so on. Pigs have more recently been positioned as 'ideal incubators' for 'essentially human organs' in tissue-specific gene 'transfer' and 'editing' programmes. The following illustrates just some of the ways in which this sameness-making has been publicly rehearsed:",

They breed relatively quickly with large litters, so a large number of life-saving organs could potentially be generated quickly when necessary. (Imutran press release, 14 August 1994) [Geneticist, Steve Jones:] There is a transgenic pig, perhaps the first of many, which contains some of the human genes for cell surface variation. The pig looks, of course, just like a pig. But to our immune system its tissues-heart or kidney, say, which are about the right size for transplantation-are more acceptable to a human patient than they otherwise would be. (Red Pepper, January 1995) Although baboons are genetically closer to humans than pigs, their hearts and lungs are too small to transplant into adults. While pigs' organs are of similar size to those of humans, the problem previously has been to make them \"friendly\" to the immune system. (Sunday Times, 5 July 1992) \u2026 professor in the department of neurosurgery, University of Minnesota, said pigs were an ideal \"biological incubator\" for growing human organs, and could potentially be used to create not just a pancreas but hearts, livers, kidneys, lungs and corneas. He said if the iPS [induced Pluripotent] cells were taken from a patient needing a transplant then these could be injected in a pig embryo which had the key genes deleted for creating the required organ, such as the liver: \"The organ would be an exact genetic copy of your liver but a much younger and healthier version and you would not need to take immunosuppressive drugs which carry side-effects.\" (BBC June 2016) In effect, clinical effectiveness depends upon the capacity of porcine xenografts to go 'unrecognized' by the host immune system. Recognition of a 'discordant species' as 'foreign' results in the adherence of host antibodies to the graft's antigens triggering 'complement cascade', a chain reaction in which blood proteins (complement) 'puncture' the cells of a transplanted graft. Most of the techniques employed over the course of several decades seek to achieve a degree of immune system 'invisibility', or 'concordance', by genetically substituting porcine complement with human complement. The first transgenic pig developed for xenotransplantation was announced as a 'breakthrough' (Brown 2000) in the early 1990s. Named Astrid, she was biotechnologically engineered with the gene for human decay-accelerating factor (hDAF).",

The xenograft vision also assumes new advances and improvements on an older generation of immunosuppressive agents like cyclosporine first introduced in the 1980s. Other approaches seek to 'condition' the human immune system prior to xenografting. This includes, 'induced chimerism', the bone marrow 'ablation' of host immunity and then reconstitution with a hybrid immune system.

Much of the discourse around pigs in this context centres on their use as meat, their instrumentalisation as a source of food to be ingested, to be embodied nutritionally. As one of the prominent UK advocates expressed it early in the debate: 'How can you criticise the use of pig tissue for therapeutic procedures that save lives while at the same time accepting the existence of a ham sandwich?' (Imutran director; Sunday Times, 5 July 1992). And yet, 'meat' itself evinces so many disparate and contested meanings, not least in the context of a metaphor in which ingestion is awkwardly likened to the living surgical embodiment of another species (Michael and Brown 2004) .

As C and B put it above, the intestinal wall is seen to keep meat in its place, 'outside' the body, whilst also 'within'. Meat 'passes through' the gut of the body, but without entering it. It is rapidly broken down into something else from which can be derived nutrition before leaving the body as excreted faecal waste. Contact with meat is transitionally time-bound, an impermanent state of affairs. Many of the respondents in our study distinguished between the use of pigs as food and xenografts in exactly these terms (Michael and Brown 2004) . The body's genuinely internal space remains therefore a zone of acute risk in the politics of xenotransplantation. Incipient threats are seen to come from an othered immunitary without (Martin 1994) , but in truly entering the body the xenograft becomes united with the body in a way that food does not.",

The xenograft imaginary, even in pursuing the more distant porcine route, remains locked into the logical contradictions of risk arising from interspecies closeness. Immunosuppression of the host, together with efforts to level immunitary differences between humans and pigs, replicates the same disease risks that seem to have ruled non-human primates out as a source of tissues. However, in the case of pigs, much of the debate has centred on the presence of, and likely pathogenicity of, Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus (PERVs). Evolutionarily familiar, and folded into the genome of all mammals over the course of millennia, such pathogens are harmless unless reactivated in ideal conditions of intimacy with other species. One of our interviewees, a leading virologist in the debate puts it like this: if you've got a closed barrier herd of pigs specially derived.. screening them, you could argue they should be a damn site cleaner than the average human \u2026 it's those few pig viruses and microbes that we don't know about still lurking there, or we can't get rid of, like PERVs. \u2026 however many times you deliver piglets by caesarean section and raise them behind filters and things where they can't pick up infections from their mothers or the field, they've inherited these viruses. (V1 2001) By 1997, a number of leading researchers in virology had begun to publically voice their concerns about PERV transmission. Patience et al. (1997) published their findings empirically demonstrating in vitro transmission of two porcine retroviruses to human cell lines. Their findings were then replicated by an FDA study (Wilson et al. 1998) . The following year, one of the main US researchers leading the programme at Harvard, Fritz Bach, had announced a self-imposed moratorium on his porcine research citing the risks of PERVs. That prompted the FDA to look more closely at xenozoonotic risk resulting in their formal statement in 1999 ruling out the use of other primates (see above). Their position, reflected by a number of national regulatory agencies around the world, was taken as a gravely discouraging sign for the porcine route too. The terms of debate were by now seen to have largely shifted radically from questions of clinical potential to biosecurity risk.",

However, twenty-three patients had porcine DNA circulating in their blood ('microchimerism') and four showed a PERV-stimulated antibody response. Here then, advocates for xenotransplantation were seen to manage this evident contradiction by creating a division in the disciplinary basis of the scientific debate about porcine infectivity, a division between immunology and virology.

Indeed, national regulatory borders have been seen to offer insufficient protections in the prevention of simultaneously transnational and transpecies infections. Early in the xenozoonotic debate, concerns had been expressed that global variation in biosecurity measures would naturally lead to pockets or 'havens for the performance of less regulated, and therefore more dangerous, xenotransplantation procedures' (Collingnon 1998, 519) . That prospect has since been borne out. In the early 2000s, news began to emerge of xeno-trails undertaken in Mexico City. Rafael Valdes Gonzalez had, together with collaborators in New Zealand and Canada, implanted porcine pancreatic islet xenografts into children with Type 1 diabetes.",

This and similar events have been taken as expressions of contrasting biopolitical conditions distributed between 'core' and 'peripheral' regulatory spaces. The Montreal-based International Xenotransplantation Association was vocal in taking the opportunity to endorse its own standards of biosecurity, whilst censuring those of others: 'Without organised international cooperation, the best efforts at minimizing these risks in countries with appropriate regulatory oversight may be thwarted by the free travel of individuals undergoing unmonitored XTP in countries lacking such regulation' (Sykes et al. 2004, 119) . The episode also drew attention to the disproportionate exploitability of different racial and economic populations. Disadvantaged children whose families, it was argued, found it difficult to pay for insulin had been recruited to the study (Persson and Welin 2008) . It also highlighted the iniquitous dimensions of 'xenotourism' between rich and poor countries already touched upon above. A number of those treated had travelled and paid considerable sums for inclusion in a trial which was seen to put individual privilege above population protection. In this way, xenografting operates through an uneven and exploitable 'spatiality of biopoliticised flesh' as Esposito puts it (2008a, 160) , resulting in the production of highly unstable 'pathogenic spaces' (Bewell 2003) . Whereas communitas implies a certain distributed boundlessness, an undifferentiated vulnerability, the immunitary exemptions found in xenotransplantation threaten to negate the protection of the communitas.",

In this context, risks to wider populations are seen to extend across the lengthy legacy periods of the lifecourse or even transgenerationally into remote futures. A number of national and international regulatory measures have evolved to explicitly require the lifelong surveillance of xenograft recipients. Not without precedent, biosecurity here comes into conflict with established conventions protecting civil liberties including the right to withdraw from clinical trials enshrined in the Declaration of Helsinki. US Guidelines on xenozoonotic infectious diseases mandate recipient compliance with 'lifelong surveillance necessitating routine physical evaluations and the archiving of tissue and/or body fluid specimens for public health purposes even if the experiment fails and the xenotransplantation product is rejected or removed' (FDA 2001, 21) . Arrangements would need to be made for the archiving of such specimens for a minimum, it is stated, of fifty years. Recipients would be further required to consent to 'the responsibility to educate his/her close contacts regarding the possibility of xenogeneic infections' (ibid.). 'Close contacts' are defined as those with whom a recipient may, as a matter of routine, share intimate contact resulting in the exchange of bodily fluids. They would therefore be obliged not to engage in 'unsafe' sexual practices and be subject to the same criminal liabilities that apply in some cases of HIV transmission. Clinical trial sponsors would be forced to document the identities of sexual contacts and immediate intimates for the purposes of subsequent tracing and monitoring. Monitoring would extend beyond death to include the compulsory autopsy of recipients. In these and other intricate respects, the FDA's guidelines are very detailed in the minutiae measures involved in the containment of an otherwise boundless pathogenic riskiness.",

That protection, or the fragile appearance of it at least, necessitates a retreat, a form of custody or capture within the bureaucratic administrative apparatus of surveillant traceability. The illimitability of flesh and the unruliness of its microbiological intimacies are in this way catalogued, recorded and archived. In denying the right to withdraw from the clinical trial, the recipient becomes permanently fixed within it. And yet it does not take a great leap of imagination to appreciate the practical contingencies upon which this brittle security depends. Much has to be taken on trust including 'compliance' with containment, with restrictions of movement, sex, intimacy and scrutiny. To what extent is this immunitary framework capable of forever guaranteeing against subsequent violation, regret, refusal, withdrawal from confinement, intended or unintended intimacies? Esposito conceives of such limits as the end of sovereignty, the point at which biopolitics is pushed beyond the bounds of its self-defined capacities for containment and control (2008a, b) . He aptly recalls Foucault's prescient thoughts on the paradoxical tension between the will towards the innovative management of life, which finally subverts control and manageability:",

This formidable extension of biopower, unlike \u2026 atomic power, will put it beyond all human sovereignty. (Foucault, in Esposito 2008a, 42) Here, we are presented with the logical contradictory collision between the immunitas of the individual and that of the communitas, the population. So profound is this paradoxical collision, it could be argued, that neither becomes possible and both are negated. The biomedical protection of an individual life, the xenograft recipient, cannot be achieved without, at the same time, its biopolitical denial. In Derrida's terms, we are able to see into the deconstructive undoing of competing immunitary mandates, principally that of the individual in conflict with that of the population. Clinical benefit comes to depend on the sacrifice of other protections including the imaginary of the sovereign self enshrined in codes of 'consent', 'autonomy' and 'self-determination'.",

In thinking through the limits of affirmative and negating immunity, Esposito writes of the collapsing fate of the inner and outer body. Immunity risks the negation of life when it 'increases to the point' such that it passes a 'threshold' turning into 'its opposite'. In xenozoonosis, it could be argued, 'the negative protection of life will end up destroying, along with the enemy outside, its own body' (Esposito 2012, 64) . Esposito and Derrida have in mind the way inner protections destroy themselves in the process of destroying that which lies in an outer beyond. Here, however, it is the selective preservation of life 'within' which indiscriminately now threatens the 'without'. There is therefore something deeply poignant in Esposito's scepticism of life immunised against death. As he puts it, 'the only way for life to defer death isn't to preserve it as such (perhaps in the immunitary form of negative protection) but rather to be reborn continually in different guises ' (2008a, b, 181) . The object of critique here is that tendency in immunitary life towards the extremes of frozen self-preservation, of life immunised against death. Clearly immunitary technologies like that of xenotransplantation are premised on profound immunitary plasticity and innovation across species boundaries. But they also come to depend on negating and contradictory stances towards newly embodied interspecies intimacies.",

Conceivably, in this case it is an over-determined bureaucratic biosecurity that makes possible couplings which jeopardise biosecurity itself. As we have seen, for Derrida, it is the denial and repression of threat through immunity which makes those threats all the more dangerous. Immunitary protections eviscerate the enemy from awareness, without ever really overcoming the underlying fretful anxiety of danger. The denied other is already within and literally so in the case of the xenograft. The sequestration of the recipient, their fixing within immunitary space, can never be wholly guaranteed. Instead, the measures outlined by the FDA above may be taken as an unwelcome reminder of a recurring dread, of a dangerous recoiling excess returning to unravel protection. In these kinds of terms, Derrida reminds us of our need for protection from self-protection, or as Rottenberg has put it 'protection beyond self-protection' (Rottenberg 2006, 13) . In deconstructive autoimmunity, there are opportunities for critical re-examination, for more productive and potentially affirmative openings. In this case, critical reflection on possibly na\u00efve biosecurity measures may potentially make way for re-examined acknowledgement of limits and contingencies.",

For Latour, rapidly reproducing and systemic hybrids can be dangerous, even catastrophic (climate change, BSE, nanoparticles, recombinant organisms, etc.) and are evidence of the underlying hidden connections between humans and non-humans, and especially false separations between 'objective' science and 'subjective' politics. Here, sometimes dangerous hybrids proliferate in the disconnected spaces between politics (institutions, bureaucracies, administrations, etc.) and science (biotechnologies, natures, life, etc.) . The boundaries of the modern constitution are premised upon forms of purification and cleansing in which lines, boundaries, limits and borders are drawn. Laws, guidelines and institutions may seek to regulate the movement of risky agents, capricious microbes and unruly practitioners. And yet it is the very act of purification itself that leads to the confounding and disruptive proliferation of a whole universe of complex hybrids and novel risks. Purification provides its own subversion. Purity begets translation and therefore hybridity. Such monsters are dissident creatures expressing the unsettled irreducibility of things. Hybrids may, sometimes, hold positive potential in forcing we moderns to recognise the contradictions of our modern constitutional arrangements. For example, those contradictions embodied in post-xenograft biosecurity arrangements. Hybridity in turn negates purity. But on the other hand, hybrids evidently harbour profound risks in terms of damage, violence, rejection and contagion. Xenografts have the potential to come apart both biologically and therefore also institutionally and constitutionally. Given these and other dystopic prospects, Latour calls for a slowing down of the proliferation of hybrids, a deceleration whereby space is created for hybrids to be acknowledged and represented 'officially' within the 'parlia-",
