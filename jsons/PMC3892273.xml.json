Their appeal is due in large part to good safety profiles, clear development paths and robust manufacturing processes. Improvements in cell culture engineering have led to yields of >10 g/L [2], while protein engineering has allowed tailoring of key characteristics such as ligand binding affinity, in vivo half-life and immunogenicity [3]. Nevertheless, engineering of a single antibody does not always result in improved clinical efficacy, as was seen with Motavizumab, a highly engineered Palivizumab variant with 70-fold improved affinity for the respiratory syncytial virus F protein that conferred no additional clinical benefit [4].",

Targeting multiple epitopes offers broad strain protection and, unlike a monotherapy, is less likely to provide selective pressure for escape mutants already present in the population [5]. Development of resistance to hyperimmune immunoglobulin by a previously sensitive pathogen has, to our knowledge, never been described, while escape variants to individual antibodies are readily generated in lab settings [6]. As blood-derived products, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) have limited availability, carry the risk of blood-borne disease transmission and batch-to-batch variability [5]. More critically, even in high-titer immunoglobulin preparations isolated from immunized volunteers, only a small fraction of antibodies bind the target of interest and of these, only a fraction will exert the desired effect (Figure 1\n). This results in a low specific activity and relatively high doses to observe a clinical effect.",

For instance, disregulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is involved in many cancers. Two approved anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (Cetuximab and Panitumumab) bind EGFR domain III, blocking ligand\u2013receptor activation and downstream signaling. Recent studies have demonstrated that combinations of antibodies binding non-overlapping epitopes are more effective than a single antibody at inhibiting tumor growth by triggering EGFR internalization and degradation [8]. Antibody combinations may also access novel mechanisms, such as complement-dependent cytotoxicity and potentiate otherwise non-protective antibodies [9]. A recently approved biclonal combination consisting of the monoclonal antibodies Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab, which target different epitopes on the HER-2 growth factor receptor, was effective in reducing progression rates in breast cancer patients who had shown progression with Trastuzumab treatment alone [10, 11]. In a remarkable feat of protein engineering, a single antibody binding site was engineered to bind both VEGF and HER2 with high affinity (K\nds of 3 and 0.2 nm, respectively) and enhanced in vivo efficacy, creating a new type of bispecific antibody in which each binding site can bind one of two distinct antigens [12]. This approach confers the advantages of bivalency to bi-specific antibodies.",

[13, 14\u2022\u2022] systematically tested combinations of two or three antibodies from a pool of 88 murine anti-EGFR antibodies for tumor inhibition activity. The most potent mixture, a 1:1 combination of antibodies 992 and 1024, showed maximal tumor inhibition, which correlated with EGFR downregulation. The antibodies bind non-overlapping epitopes on EGFR domain III; indeed antibody 992 exhibited synergistic growth inhibition with all antibodies tested that bind non-overlapping epitopes. Suggesting this may be a common strategy, Spangler et al. examined pairwise combinations of six murine anti-EGFR antibodies, with the pair most potently reducing surface EGFR levels binding non-overlapping domain III epitopes, leading to reduced receptor recycling [15]. Treatment with 50 mg/kg of Sym004 led to complete tumor regression in all mice, while Cetuximab alone or the individual antibodies exhibited only partial suppression. Sym004 performed well in preclinical studies and is currently in Phase II trials [16].",

These therapeutics may be more viable as combinations of antibodies binding potently neutralizing epitopes and triggering appropriate effector functions. Since polyclonal antibodies were first used to treat toxin-mediated diseases, early efforts to deconvolute the polyclonal response into a mixture of specific monoclonal antibodies centered on these pathogens. One study showed that antibodies elicited by murine immunization bound 20 distinct epitopes on the tetanus toxoid heavy chain [17], while in humans 17 unique epitopes were observed [18]. Quaternary combinations of the murine antibodies were 200-fold more protective in a mouse model than the individual antibodies [17]. In another study, two human anti-tetanus toxin antibodies provided similar protection as a polyclonal preparation at >100-fold lower dose (0.7 mg versus 100 mg) [19].",

Analysis of the detailed pharmacokinetics of BoNT/A in the presence of a similar set of antibodies identified therapeutic windows for passive immunization postintoxication [21\u2022\u2022]. The antibodies are thought to block receptor binding and toxin internalization, followed by Fc-dependent hepatic clearance of antibody-toxin complexes [22]. Engineered, human versions of these antibodies are in development as Xoma 3AB, an equimolar mixture of three antibodies, which is over 500-times more potent in mouse potency tests than the equine IVIG. While this product can treat only one of the seven BoNT serotypes (encompassing sub-types A1, A2 and A3) [22], analogous cocktails are in development for other serotypes. In another protein engineering feat, individual antibodies have been engineered to bind the same epitope as presented by multiple sub-types or even multiple serotypes with high affinity and specificity and could potentially be combined to create a single cocktail with broader strain coverage [23\u2022, 24\u2022\u2022].",

Crucell Holland BV identified two human antibodies, CR57 and CR4098 from immunized humans that bind non-overlapping epitopes on the rabies glycoprotein with high affinity (2.4 and 4.5 nm, respectively) [25]. While most antibodies neutralizing rabies virus bind conformational epitopes in antigenic site II, CR57 binds a linear epitope in site I (residues 226\u2013231) and CR4098 binds a conformational epitope within site III. Each monoclonal antibody alone was shown to neutralize 24 of 26 street isolates, similar to rabies IVIG. However, the binary combination neutralized all 26 strains and was at least as potent as IVIG in a hamster model [26]. Critically, escape variants with mutations in the CR57 epitope are neutralized by CR4098 and vice versa, while in vitro selection for variants escaping both antibodies was unsuccessful [6]. This binary cocktail is safe in humans [27\u2022], can be administered in conjunction with the rabies vaccine and is now in Phase II clinical trials as CL184.",

A triclonal mixture of broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies binding the fusogenic gp120 (2G12) and conformational epitopes within the membrane proximal region of gp41 (4E10, 2F5) has been assessed in a Phase II trial, with six of fourteen volunteers showing partial or complete control of viremia [32, 33]. A binary mixture of antibodies binding the non-overlapping CD4 binding site (VRC01) and a glycan-dependent epitope in the V1V2 region of the viral spike trimer (PG9) demonstrated neutralization of 98% of 208 HIV strains in vitro [34].",

In ITP, platelets are opsonized by auto-antibodies and destroyed by Fc-mediated phagocytosis. IVIG and RhIG are speculated to protect against ITP by opsonizing red blood cells, which then bind macrophage Fc\u03b3RIIIa receptors, outcompeting antibody-bound platelets. This notion is supported by evidence that red blood cell clearance correlates with anti-RhD coverage [36\u2022]. Since RhIG is currently purified from the serum of immunized male volunteers, experiences periodic supply shortages and recognizes a single antigen, it has been the target of efforts to develop recombinant antibody therapies.",

To provide coverage for these possibilities, Sym001 was designed as a combination of 25 individual anti-RhD antibodies, binding 99% of observed RhD variants. These antibodies were derived from the lymphocytes of eight RhD\u2212 women with high anti-RhD titers [37]. The product was recently tested in a Phase I/II dose-escalation study from 75 to 300 \u03bcg/kg with 61 subjects.

In spite of broad vaccine coverage, disease persists and incidence has increased dramatically in recent years, with high infant morbidity and mortality rates. However, treatment with high-titer anti-pertussis toxin IVIG has been shown to reverse disease symptoms up to seven days after infection in mice [45] and in Phase II trials with infants, shown to reduce the number of whoops [46, 47, 48]. There are also several examples in the literature of synergistic antibody combinations with potencies surpassing that of polyclonal antisera in mice [49]. Since the key antigens are well-characterized with, in most cases, neutralizing antibodies and protective epitopes already identified [49, 50, 51], antibodies could be rationally combined to identify a potently protective cocktail. The antibodies could be individually engineered for traits likely to correlate with protection, including high affinity, recognition of all circulating clinical strains with characterized mechanisms of protection [50, 52].",

What minimal collection will be synergistic and potently protective yet robust against antigenic variation? The answer may lie in defining antibody repertoires responding to the different epitopes present on an antigen; from this comprehensive collection, protective antibodies binding different epitopes can be selected for further characterization and engineering. Older work used phage libraries generated from donor PBMCs, but this approach suffers from loss of native light-heavy chain pairing and heterologous expression constraints [53]. Exciting newer technologies have been developed to isolate and sequence the variable regions present in antigen-specific plasmablasts [54, 55, 56, 57], which correlate with serum antibodies observed proteomically [58\u2022\u2022, 59\u2022\u2022].",

These are then expanded, expressed and purified separately before combining in defined ratios [32, 67\u2022]. Theoretically, bi-and triclonal mixtures are not complicated, thus manufacturing them as monoclonals avoids overhauling established manufacturing platforms with the main concern being undesirable interactions between the component antibodies upon combination. For instance, the XOMA 3AB anti-BoNT triclonal cocktail is produced in this way, with the presence and integrity of each component antibody monitored by HPLC chromatography (hydrophobic interaction and reverse phase) and ELISA, using toxin domains specifically engineered to bind a single antibody in the mixture [67\u2022]. This cocktail can be stored at 2\u20138\u00b0C for two years and is robust to lyophilization, retaining full-antigen-reactivity after five months at 50\u00b0C [68]. However, as the number of unique molecules increases above two or three, the manufacturing costs rise precipitously, since each molecule sequentially monopolizes facilities and requires individual characterization. Moreover, as each batch is subject to failure, producing multiple small batches eliminates the savings achieved by economies of scale in larger recombinant protein production facilities [69] (Figure 3\n).",

Merus solved this by generating Oligoclonics\u2122, a single PER.C6\u00ae stable cell line expressing one light common chain and three heavy chains, producing a consistent antibody mixture with three unique binding sites at 15\u201320 pg/cell/day for up to 67 cell divisions [70\u2022\u2022]. The process works since in many cases, light chains are promiscuous, forming functional binding sites with a variety of heavy chains [18]. In this case, ligand-specific heavy chains were selected from a human Fab phage library containing a single rearranged light chain, although Merus has now developed a transgenic mouse with a single human light chain and diverse human heavy chains to further develop the technology [71].",

Equal numbers of 25 unique cell lines were combined to yield the Sym001 working cell bank, with the resulting polyclonal antibody mixture showing similar composition as measured by the ion exchange profile and activity in four 400 L bioreactor lots. This consistency was achieved in spite of up to 10-fold different expression levels. In addition to the standard analyses used to characterize monoclonal antibodies, a robust product-specific liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry method was developed to unambiguously quantify antibody ratios based on the light chain [73\u2022, 74\u2022\u2022].

The polyclonal preparation produced \u223c13 pg/cell/day with stable antibody compositions as assessed by ion exchange chromatography over \u223c27 cell generations [75]. In a third approach, the adeno-associated virus rep protein mediates stable integration of antibody genes into HEK cells. While early, this appears to be rapid yet provides control over the final antibody ratios. Mixtures of five lines have shown consistent expression levels and stable antibody ratios for up to 100 days [76].",

Given that these are recombinant biologics, they are likely to fall under the regulations made by CDER, including the combination drug rule, Title 21 in the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR 3.2), which indicates that each component be assessed for safety and efficacy individually as well as in combination [66]. Thus, for a mixture of two antibodies, three clinical trials may be required (antibody 1, antibody 2 and the binary combination). This quickly becomes cost-prohibitive as the number of antibodies increases, unless only previously approved antibodies are considered, such as an anti-HER2 and anti-EGFR combination. Additionally, consistent production and the lack of lot-to-lot variability must be ensured. For antibody cocktails that are combined postpurification, each antibody in the mixture must adhere to the same product quality and consistency requirements as for a single monoclonal. Given that most monoclonals are produced in CHO cells, with glycosylation variation and other micro-heterogeneities affecting efficacy and long in vivo half-lives, the regulatory requirements are strict [77]. For instance, HepeX-B, a combination of two monoclonal antibodies against hepatitis B, or HBV, reported positive results of a Phase IIb study but was terminated, reportedly due to operational and economic challenges surrounding design of a Phase III trial [78].",

It depends on perspective: are recombinant polyclonals merely antibody cocktails produced in a single bioreactor? If so, then each component would be expected to be well-characterized and contribute to efficacy. If it is possible to produce each component individually, they can be considered a monoclonal antibody derivative regulated by CDER. Alternatively, are recombinant polyclonals a highly potent, less complex variant of IVIG? In this case, not all individual antibodies would be expected to contribute to the pharmacological effect, as long as the product is efficacious, safe and reproducibly manufactured. For instance, Symphogen's lead anti-RhD product Sym001 includes 25 unique molecular entities. Phase II trials demonstrated similar activity for Sym001 at much lower doses than anti-RhesusD IVIG [40\u2022\u2022]. The key question is, are all 25 antibodies are essential [79\u2022\u2022]? Whether 25, 24, or only three antibodies provide the pharmacological effect is relevant primarily for its effects on manufacturing complexity and dose. For infectious diseases, the more complex the polyclonal, the less important any single antibody becomes and the smaller the chance that a point mutation or combination of point mutations will render an organism completely resistant.",

Advances in antibody repertoire characterization are facilitating deconvolution of the polyclonal immune response to a minimal set of antibodies recognizing complementary epitopes with characterized mechanisms of protection and will prove key to selecting antibodies for inclusion in these cocktails. Similarly, transformative new technologies are emerging in terms of highly polyclonal recombinant antibody therapeutics, led by the pioneering anti-RhD product, Sym001.
