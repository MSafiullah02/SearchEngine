The etiological agent, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), induces reproductive disorders (embryonic death, abortion, reduced fertility), immunosuppression, respiratory problems, diarrhea, and persistently infected (PI) calves that are immunotolerant to the virus [1\u20133]. According to a review by Yarnall and Thrusfield published in 2017, the economic impact of BVDV can vary between 0 to 710 dollars per cow per year. This range considers the subclinical disease, generally observed in herds with endemic BVDV infection, as well as epidemic or acute clinical infections that are seen more frequently in naive herds [4].",

Currently, the 5\u2019UTR is the main genomic region used for this purpose. Analysis of this genomic region has allowed the demarcation of BVDV species. However, due to its short length and high nucleotide conservation level, BVDV-1 subtypes usually cannot be easily defined, sometimes leading to incorrect subtype assignment [17, 18]. The use of 5\u2019UTR/Npro allows proper assignment of BVDV strains to the different species and subtypes of BVDV [19]. Alternatively, the E2 glycoprotein, which is 1122 nucleotides in length, has been also used for this purpose. E2 is a less-conserved genomic region, and the most variable region of E2 is the amino-terminal end. The DA and DB domains of the E2 protein (residues 4-87 and 88-164, respectively), are the most exposed on the virus surface and therefore contain the main antigenic sites of the virion [20, 21]. Due to its variability, phylogenetic studies carried out with E2 have shown higher resolution than those based on other genomic regions. Additionally, comparative analysis of field and vaccine strains has been useful for discovering strains that are capable of escaping neutralizing antibodies [22].",

Research studies carried out in Uruguay in 2000 revealed that only 3% of farmers vaccinated cattle against BVDV. BVDV was found on 100% of the farms studied, and a seroprevalence of 67% was found in cattle [39]. These data were updated recently with similar values of seroprevalence at the farm level (98.8%) and higher seroprevalence at the herd level (approximately 80%, Dr. Federico Fern\u00e1ndez, Ministerio de Ganader\u00eda, Agricultura y Pesca, MGAP, personal communication).

The amino-terminal region of E2 is the most exposed region on the surface of the virus and therefore is the most antigenic region of this protein [20]. In the E2 region, most of the nucleotide changes are non-synonymous and lead to amino acid changes (see Table 2). In this region, 11 amino acid changes were found when comparing the two Uruguayan lineages of BVDV-1a and the NADL strain, revealing a significant degree of genetic variability among vaccine strain and strains circulating in Uruguay (Table 3b, Fig. 4). Substitutions at residues 71, 87, 88 and 90 found in the two BVDV-1a lineages circulating in Uruguay relative to the NADL strain are part of two epitopes of E2 [20, 35]. Therefore, these substitutions in glycoprotein E2 of the Uruguayan strains could lead to a protection/neutralization failure in animals vaccinated with the NADL strain.

Although the amino acid changes at residues 38, 68 and 81 were not within previously reported antigenic sites, they might cause changes in the properties of the E2 protein. The mutation at residue 54 of BVDV-1a lineage 1 UY resulted in a smaller R group in the valine residue than in the methionine residue shared by the NADL vaccine strain and members of BVDV-1a lineage 2 UY. More studies are needed to determine whether these amino acid changes are relevant for the fitness of the Uruguayan strains with this amino acid fingerprint.",
