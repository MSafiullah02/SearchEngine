            "text": "Two obligate template switches, minus and plus strand transfer, occur during the synthesis of every retroviral DNA.1., 2. Minus strand synthesis initiates from the primer binding site (pbs) near the 5\u2032 end of viral RNA and continues to the genome's 5\u2032 end, generating a replication intermediate called minus strand strong stop DNA (\u2212sssDNA; Figure 1(A)). Transfer of \u2212sssDNA to the U3/R junction at the 3\u2032 end of viral RNA allows continued minus strand synthesis. This transfer is aided by complementarity between \u2212sssDNA and repeated regions called R, which are present at both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of genomic RNA. Retroviral R repeats differ in length from 247 nt for human T-cell leukemia virus type 2 to only 16 nt in mouse mammary tumor virus.3 Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) have 97 and 69 base R regions, respectively. Even for viruses with short Rs, minus strand transfer is apparently very efficient, since no detectable abortive \u2212sssDNA accumulates in infected cells unless variants defective in strand transfer, such as RNaseH mutants, are studied.4., 5., 6. Short Rs suffice for some retroviruses, and incomplete Rs can support minus strand transfer.7., 8., 9., 10., 11. Thus, the whole length of complementarity present in most viral Rs is not necessary for minus strand transfer.",

Although this later type of template switching has been viewed as non-essential, emerging data suggest that recombinogenic switching ordinarily occurs during most rounds of viral DNA synthesis.15., 16. It has been suggested that the reason reverse transcription is highly recombinogenic is that the need to perform replicative template switches provided a selective advantage for reverse transcriptase (RT) to become prone to recombinogenic switching as well.17., 18. Although some sequences may serve as recombination \u201chot\u201d or \u201ccold\u201d spots, recombinogenic switching occurs at essentially random positions throughout templates.19., 20., 21., 22. Recombination frequency increases in rough proportion to the length of identical sequence on donor and acceptor templates23 and declines with decreasing extents of sequence similarity.15 Thus, sequence complementarity between the DNA synthesized on a donor template and the acceptor template region to which switching occurs is an important determinant of recombinogenic template switching.",

This new assay system was next used to study mismatch extension during minus strand transfer, and to assess the effects of limited primer-terminal complementarity on acceptor template use. Separate vectors were developed to examine plus strand transfer and recombinogenic transfer, and homology requirements for minus strand transfer were compared to those for recombinogenic switching. The data indicated that minus strand transfer and recombinogenic template switching are not equivalent events in terms of homology requirements. The findings demonstrated that targeting of minus strand transfer to the U3/R junction is aided by cis-acting determinants that allow accurate and efficient template switching in the presence of far less complementarity than that which is required during recombination.",

The nature of minus strand transfer could be addressed by restriction analysis because the MLV U3/R junction contains a fortuitous AscI site (see Figure 3(A)). If strand transfer occurred precisely at the U3/R junction, an AscI site would be regenerated. If anomalous transfer occurred, the AscI site would be destroyed. For both MLVpuro and RSVpuro, >99% of the PCR products were digested with AscI (Figure 3(B), lanes 2 and 4), indicating that both constructs supported accurate minus strand transfer. However, products of the mismatched derivatives, MLV5TMM and RSV5TMM, differed significantly. The MLV5TMM construct contained a single point mutation 5\u2032 of the U3/R junction in the upstream LTR, which converted the AscI site to an SfoI site (Figure 3(A)). Thus, digestion of integrated products with SfoI was diagnostic of MLV5TMM read-in or plasmid recombination-generated artifacts (Figure 2(C)) while digestion with PstI indicated premature jump (strand transfer occurring before minus strand strong stop DNA was completed: see Figure 2(B)), and digestion with AscI would indicate mismatch extension. For MLV5TMM, none of the product was digested by AscI while approximately 50% was digested with PstI and 50% was digested with SfoI (Figure 3(B), lanes 6\u20138). In contrast, products of RSV5TMM showed nearly 100% cleavage with PstI and no detectable cleavage with AscI or SfoI (Figure 3(B), lanes 10\u201312). This indicated that a significant portion of the MLV5TMM products were artifacts with the remainder premature jump, while premature jump occurred in nearly all the strand transfer events observed for RSV5TMM. No mismatch extension (digestion with AscI) was evident among products of either vector.",

Instead, AscI digestion of RSVpuro and MLVpuro products, which indicated the absence of +1G mutations, was essentially complete (see, for example, Figure 3(B), lanes 2 and 4, and Figure 3(C), lane 2). We therefore conclude that the +1G product should not significantly diminish the extent of AscI cutting, which was used to diagnose precise transfer at the U3/R junction in this report.",

This series of vectors was designated \u201cTMM\u201d, for terminal mismatch.

It was anticipated that one or more of the outcomes described in Figure 2(B) would result from minus strand transfer between mismatched donors and acceptors. These include mismatch extension, strand transfer prior to the completion of \u2212sssDNA (premature jump), or no extension resulting in abortive synthesis. If mismatch extension occurred, the U3/R Asc I site would be generated from transfer of the 5\u2032R sequences. If premature jump occurred, the restriction site that tagged the mutant sequence present in the 3\u2032R would be present in the reverse transcription product.

To do this, each mutant construct was individually co-transfected into packaging cells at varying molar ratios with pRSVpuroM/B, a derivative of pRSVpuro that maintained wild-type titer but contained diagnostic restriction sites (MfeI and BamHI). Media harvested from co-transfected packaging cells was presumed to contain viral particles with mutant and RSVpuroM/B internal standard RNAs present in the same ratios as the mutant to internal standard plasmid ratios transfected. The relative success of reverse transcription and integration for mutant vectors was evaluated by PCR amplifying proviral sequences from pooled genomic DNA after selection with puromycin, followed by restriction analysis to quantify ratios of mutant versus internal standard products. This method's accuracy and reproducibility were assessed using vectors with known titers (data not shown). Table 1 shows titers determined using this approach, which are presented as order of magnitude reduction compared to the internal standard. A wild-type titer (10\u00b0) indicates that the mutant competed with the internal standard when transfected at a 1:1 ratio. One order of magnitude reduction (10\u22121) means that mutant titers were approximately 10% and that the mutant could compete with the standard when transfected at a ratio of 9:1. Two orders of magnitude reduction (10\u22122) means that vector titers were approximately 1% and that the mutant could compete when transfected at a ratio of 99:1. Three orders of magnitude reduction (10\u22123) represents a more than a 1000-fold decrease in titer. When the terminal mismatch vectors were tested, all displayed one order of magnitude reduction in titer (Table 1). More precise determinations indicated a titer of approximately 40% for the 1TMM vector while 4TMM and 5TMM had titers approximately 5% that of the internal standard. Restriction analysis of the proviral junctions of the 4TMM and 5TMM vectors (Figure 4(C)) revealed that no detectable mismatch extension occurred, only premature jump or mistargeting to another location, indicating that strand transfer prior to the completion of \u2212sssDNA occurred at a rate of less than 5%. This level of premature jump is similar to a previous study in our laboratory using the MLVpuro system.30 That study determined premature strand transfer rates of 1\u20132%, which is likely an underestimation due to the plasmid recombination/read-in transcription artifacts we described above.",

Similarly, the TM3 vector targeted to the U3/R junction 12% of the time despite the availability of more extensive complementarity at the nearby BssHII site, and did not detectably utilize either of two other fortuitous 3 nt targets in U3.

Based on their abundance among detected products and the titers of the vectors that generated them, these rare products likely arose at frequencies roughly five orders of magnitude lower than matched donor/acceptor products. To determine the origins of some of these rare products, bands were excised from dried gels, eluted in TE, and re-amplified by PCR. Four alternate products were sequenced. One resulted from transfer of full length R to an alternate site, two products resulted from transfer from read-in transcripts, and one resulted from premature jump before completion of \u2212sssDNA. The minor alternate target for full-length R transfer was located in the SV40 polyadenylation region. The point of transfer for this product contained three primer terminal complementary nucleotides, followed by one mismatch, and then three additional complementary nucleotides. One of the read-in transcripts transferred with 8 nt of fortuitous complementarity present within the SV40 polyadenylation region. The second read-in transcript transferred to a region with no sequence complementarity. Finally, the viral RNA that templated the premature jump product apparently contained plasmid sequences downstream of the SV40 polyadenylation site. These additional 3\u2032 end sequences served as a region of extended (>20 base) complementarity between the point of premature transfer and a fortuitous acceptor in the lengthy polyadenylation read-through RNA. None of the analyzed minor products were premature transfer from within \u2212sssDNA to any of the dozens of potential premature transfer product four base matches located in U3, thus further supporting previous work that suggests premature transfer is rare.30\n",

Previous work has shown that experiments that use two-LTR vector constructs are prone to artifacts that can limit assay sensitivity.9., 12., 28., 32. Thus, our initial effort focused on developing a new assay system that removed repeated elements unnecessary to the experiments here, and demonstrating that levels of previously described read-in and plasmid recombination artifacts were reduced to below detectable levels. We used the improved vectors to re-examine some of our own results which hindsight suggested may have suffered from artifacts.28 In particular, we assessed how much mismatch extension was detectable during minus strand transfer. The new results demonstrated that while up to three bases of mismatch were extended during minus strand transfer, extension products were not detectable for four and five base mismatches. We now attribute our previous suggestion that five bases of primer-terminal mismatch could be extended during minus strand transfer28 to transfection-related and/or read-in transcript artifacts that were minimized in the new assay system.",

Thus, the present observations are probably more accurate than the previous reports,12 and it seems likely that three mismatches cannot be extended appreciably during gammaretrovirus plus strand transfer. This plus strand result differed from those for minus strand transfer, since mismatch extension generated 12% of the minus strand transfer products for vectors with three mismatches in the present study. This may be due to inherent differences between plus and minus strand transfer, or it may reflect differences in homology lengths.

Our findings confirmed previous reports that efficient recombinogenic transfer requires 12 or more bases of primer-terminal homology.29 However, efficient and accurate replicative transfer to the U3/R junction was observed with only five bases, and even 3 nt targeted transfer to a limited extent. The notion that something other than primer/template complementarity contributes to U3/R targeting was further supported by tandem R studies, which revealed a remarkable bias for the U3/R junction when two acceptors with equivalent homology competed. In addition, significant targeting to minimal U3/R junction acceptors was observed even when lengthier alternate regions of homology were available at a distal acceptor site. The preference for the U3/R junction over the distal acceptor site cannot be attributed to titer inhibition by the lacZ spacer sequences, since titers for all the decoy constructs, except the 5Lac5 construct, were nearly wild-type.",

Therefore, we suggest the possibility that the findings based on a vector that lacks U3 sequences9 may be a better model for recombinogenic switching than for minus strand transfer. If that interpretation is adopted, the results presented here are consistent with the earlier findings. For example, our experiments demonstrated that even for native R sequences, if the sequences are placed outside their native context (as in Figure 6, Figure 8 experiments) targeting does not occur when less than 12 bases are retained. In the present work, even when 30 R nucleotides were retained at an ectopic site, there was no detectable use of these sequences when they were placed in competition with an acceptor of equal length in an authentic U3/R context. In contrast, even three R nucleotides in the U3/R context were sufficient to direct limited accurate minus strand transfer.",

As is the case for retroviruses, hepatitis B reverse transcription involves template switching. However, although complementarity is present at hepatitis B template switch acceptor sites, there is much less complementarity present (2\u201318 bases) than in retroviral genomes. These limited base-pairing interactions are clearly far less important to specifying the correct site for hepatitis B DNA re-initiation than are genetically-defined distal sequence elements in that virus.31., 43. A recent study44 demonstrated that base-pairing between cis-acting sequences in duck hepatitis B virus facilitates strand transfer presumably by bringing donor and acceptor sites, present at opposite ends of the genome, into close proximity. Somewhat similar stories of cis-acting elements that specify priming specificity are emerging for RNA viruses such as coronaviruses and picornaviruses.45., 46. Although alternate mechanisms may also exist,47 3\u2032 end recognition for these viruses appears to rely on host proteins that bind specifically to genetic elements in viral RNAs' 3\u2032 ends. Initiation site selection mediated by cross talk between genome 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends functions in the replication of LTR-retroelements, mouse hepatitis virus, and dengue virus.48., 49., 50. Thus, in several RNA virus systems, cis-acting elements and/or proteins which bind them contribute to specifying replication product initiation sites, and it would not be surprising if similar factors functioned in the replication of retroviruses.",

Context-dependent retroviral template switching \u201chot spots\u201d that do not reside at strong stop transfer points have been reported.51., 52. Presumably, switching at these sites is not mediated by the putative factors that contribute to replicative switching, unless such factors are present throughout genomic RNA. Precedence for factor-independent targeting signals also comes from the observation that for at least some retroelements, partially purified RTs alone appear to recognize context-dependent initiation elements in naked RNA.53\n",

Our results confirm that minus strand transfer efficiency to the U3/R junction is enhanced with increasing homology length until efficiency, as measured by titer, reaches parental levels at 12 bases, and that extensive regions of homology at ectopic sites are sufficient to misdirect strand transfer to those sites. However, the accurate targeting of \u2212sssDNA with wild-type efficiency to a 12 base R in the U3/R context differs markedly from our observed >100-fold reduced efficiency and incomplete accuracy of targeting observed for 12 base acceptors during recombinogenic template switching. We hypothesize that the U3/R junction resides in a region with primer/template complementarity-independent targeting determinants that contribute to minus strand transfer, and which have been retained in MLV in addition to the R regions of primer/template complementarity.",

Fragments containing the RSV U3 and the MLV R regions were PCR amplified from pREP8 (Invitrogen) and pMLVpuro (also called pAM86-554), respectively. These were fused by PCR using complementary overlapping primers to generate an RSV U3/MLV R fragment. This fragment replaced the upstream LTR between the SalI and SpeI sites of pMLVpuro47 to generate pRSVpuro. Variant R sequences were constructed by PCR using mutagenic primers and cloned into the downstream LTR using standard techniques. Pbs mutants were constructed by amplifying the pbs region using mutagenic primers and subcloning into pRSVpuro. pRSVpuroM/B was the parental clone for this series of mutants: as presented in Figure 7(A), this construct contains one point mutation on either side of the pbs, introducing an MfeI site upstream of the pbs and a BamHI site downstream. For constructs with 493 nt of lacZ downstream of R in the 3\u2032 LTR, R1-lacZ-R2 sequences were PCR amplified and inserted into pRSVpuro. Sequences extend from nucleotides 21 to 514 of the lacZ coding region. PuroIntron clones were pRSVpuro derivatives subcloned from a plasmid, pJPE657-13, which contained an artificial intron that was based on intron consensus sequences55 inserted into the puromycin resistance gene of pMLVpuro. The intron was constructed by PCR amplifying pUC sequences with flanking primers containing intron consensus sequences and subcloning into pMLVpuro. The donors used in PuroIntron clones were derived from the first 30 nt of the MLV R and 5 nt, 12 nt, or 30 nt of the MLV R, located in the context of non-U3 intron sequences, served as the acceptor sequences. Note that the acceptor for the 30TMintron clone was subcloned from the 30Rlac30R construct and thus contained the 493 nt lacZ spacer downstream of the 30 nt acceptor. All PCR-generated fragments were sequenced to verify that all clones contained the intended sequences.",
