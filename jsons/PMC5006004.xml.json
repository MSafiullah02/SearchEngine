This is, to our knowledge, the largest study to examine both the burden and impact of respiratory virus co\u2010infection in subjects with severe influenza A infection requiring ICU admission during the first wave of the 2009 pandemic. In contrast, viral co\u2010infection was observed in seven of 39 (17\u00b79%) patients with severe influenza A/H1N109 infection (defined as infection resulting in hospitalisation or death) in Argentina by Palacios et al.\n\n14\n RSV was identified in 6/39 of patients with severe disease (15\u00b74%) compared with 5/160 (3\u00b71%, P < 0\u00b701) with mild disease.

Estenssoro et al. demonstrated that S. pneumoniae co\u2010infection was an independent predictor of hospital mortality yet this study and that by Martin\u2010Loeches et al. failed to identify any significant difference between co\u2010infection and ICU mortality.\n12\n, \n13\n Martin\u2010Loesches et al.\n\n13\n found that co\u2010infected patients were older and had higher APACHE scores, yet no differences in co\u2010morbidities were noted. Our data demonstrate that those with co\u2010infection were younger and had fewer co\u2010morbidities normally associated with an increased need for ICU admission. This association was particularly strong for obesity. The significance of this finding was preserved if children were included or excluded from the analysis. Martin\u2010Loesches et al. demonstrated that subjects with bacterial co\u2010infection were more likely to require invasive ventilation and vasopressors. This was not demonstrated in this study. Despite the failure to identify differences in the severity of illness in subjects with and without co\u2010infection, it is still possible that co\u2010infection was a contributory factor to severe disease. As enrolment in this study required severe influenza requiring ICU admission, it is possible that co\u2010infection was the precipitant that led to ICU admission in younger people without co\u2010morbidities. To explore this hypothesis further, a clinically well\u2010characterised control group not requiring ICU admission would be required.",

All subjects with staphylococcal co\u2010infection in our study had community\u2010acquired infection. Similar rates of co\u2010morbidities were observed in patients with S. aureus co\u2010infection compared with patients co\u2010infected with other organisms.

Despite a uniform approach to diagnosis of CAP, a pathogen is identified in <50% of cases.\n31\n The observational nature of this study means that the diagnostic approach varied between different patients and ICUs. These limitations existing in other comparable studies.\n12\n, \n13\n Adequate lower respiratory specimens and samples for culture\u2010independent laboratory tests (e.g. pneumococcal urinary antigen) were not routinely submitted for microbiological analysis. In addition, it is likely that many subjects were administered antibiotics prior to specimen collection. It is therefore possible that the true burden of bacterial and viral co\u2010infection is underestimated. Despite the use of quantitative and/or semiquantitative laboratory methods, co\u2010infecting and colonising bacteria remain difficult to differentiate. We have attempted to overcome this by further analysing lower respiratory tract specimens using quantitative nucleic acid amplification techniques, a test not routinely used for the diagnosis of CAP. This approach was hampered by limited lower respiratory sampling in the 14 ICUs enrolling subjects. It is possible, however, that the detection of bacteria colonising the lower respiratory tract at high concentrations may falsely elevate the observed rate of bacterial pneumonia. It is possible that delays in processing samples led to nucleic acid degradation. Furthermore, viral co\u2010infection may have been underestimated as emerging viral pathogens, such as human bocavirus and coronaviruses, were not tested for. Upper respiratory tract samples were most frequently examined for viral pathogens. Additional pathogens may have been detected if upper and lower respiratory samples were available for analysis on all patients.\n32\n Radiology data and timing of antibiotic administration data were not collected in the study. It is probable that the burden of co\u2010infection would be higher in subjects with radiologically confirmed pneumonia and those examined prior to receipt of antibiotics.",

Co\u2010infection had little impact on severity of illness or outcome in those admitted to intensive care but may have contributed to the need for ICU admission in those without other risk factors.
