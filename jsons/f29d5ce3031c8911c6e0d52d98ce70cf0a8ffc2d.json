Thus, the overall contribution of HBoV to all detected respiratory viruses lies well below that of RSV. High prevalence does not necessarily mean high clinical relevance, and proving its causative role has been diffi cult because the virus is often detected along with other viruses; co-detection rates are as high as 75% (11, 12) .",

HBoV is the most probable cause of respiratory tract disease if the patient has a high viral load in nasopharyngeal aspirates accompanied by viremia, if HBoV is the only pathogen detected, and if an acute primary HBoV infection is diagnosed by serologic testing (5, 11, 13) . We detected HBoV DNA in nasopharyngeal aspirate and serum. The serologic results strongly suggest that this child had an acute primary HBoV infection. The serologic assay developed earlier was validated in a series of studies and shown to reliably measure serologic response against HBoV (5) (6) (7) (8) . Infl ammatory markers were not elevated, thereby indicating no bacterial infection. However, the contribution of bacteria to the course of the disease cannot be completely ruled out.",
