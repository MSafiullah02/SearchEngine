However, immunity is incomplete and reinfection can occur [2]. PIV infection in immunocompromised patients, particularly in the setting of hematologic malignancy, solid organ transplantation, or HSCT [3], is increasingly recognized and can be associated with a wide spectrum of disease, ranging from mild upper respiratory symptoms to pneumonitis and severe respiratory failure. The mortality rate of PIV lower respiratory disease has varied among studies, reaching more than 50% in some reports [2, 3].",

Viral culture is also used, but it may take several days to return positive. PIV PCR is highly sensitive and specific, but it may not be readily available or may take more time than antibody assays [4]. Recently multiplex PCR testing has become available for multiple respiratory pathogens including parainfluenza viruses. The University of Chicago lab currently performs the PCR amplification method with analysis by automated nested multiplex PCR by a commercially available assay. The test is performed in house everyday with a 6- to 8-h turnover, and it detects the important respiratory viruses (influenza A; influenza A subtypes H1, H3, and H1-2009; influenza B; respiratory syncytial virus; parainfluenza viruses types 1\u20134; adenovirus; human metapneumovirus; coronavirus HKU1, NL63, and 229E; and enterovirus/rhinovirus) and three bacterial pathogens (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Bordetella pertussis).",

Small studies and cases reports have shown mixed results regarding the clinical benefit of aerosolized or systemic ribavirin, with or without IV gamma globulin. The majority of studies to date have failed to demonstrate improved outcomes in treated patients in terms of progression to pneumonia, need for mechanical ventilation, duration of illness, or mortality [3, 8]. Many of the patients in these studies had other respiratory co-pathogens, which was associated with higher mortality. Organisms identified included mixed viral infection (e.g., CMV, adenovirus, or respiratory syncytial virus), superimposed bacterial or fungal infection (particularly aspergillosis), and mycobacterial infection [3, 8]. Dual infection with P. jirovecii and a respiratory virus has also been reported [9]. Recently, DAS181, a sialidase fusion protein that cleaves Neu5Ac alpha (2,3) and (2,6)-Gal linkages of sialic acid from respiratory endothelial cell surfaces, has been used in 16 HSCT recipients with PIV infection (14 with pneumonia), with complete clinical response in 9 patients and partial in 4. There was no control group in the study. The drug is administered either by oral inhalation using a dry powder inhaler or by nebulizer for intubated patients. It targets a host protein to which PIV binds rather than a viral structure [10].\n",

            "text": "\nP. jirovecii cannot be cultured, and the diagnosis requires identification of the organism by staining of fluid from an induced sputum, BAL, or lung biopsy specimen by microscopy. DFA staining has become the most commonly used method. In some studies among immunocompromised patients without HIV there was a lower organism burden and a poorer diagnostic yield of conventional staining of a specimen from induced sputum or BAL [15]. Although the P. jirovecii real-time PCR has a higher sensitivity and specificity than DFA and can be particularly useful in this population [16], the test may not be able to differentiate colonization from true infection. Therefore, tissue sampling for diagnosis may be necessary to confirm PJP in non-HIV-infected patients [17].\nKey Points/PearlsThe differential diagnosis of pulmonary infiltrates in the immunocompromised host is broad, and a detailed history and workup are essential to establish a specific etiology.Tissue sampling is frequently needed to establish a definitive diagnosis of PJP in non-HIV-infected immunocompromised patients.Multiple simultaneous infectious and noninfectious pathologic processes are common in immunocompromised patients.PJP should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with HIV, as well as immunocompromised patients without HIV who are presenting with pneumonia.The mainstay of therapy for PIV infection remains supportive, given the lack of evidence supporting the use of ribavirin or IV gamma globulin, although DAS181, a sialidase fusion protein that cleaves Neu5Ac alpha (2,3) and (2,6)-Gal linkages of sialic acid from respiratory endothelial cell surfaces, has been used in 16 HSCT recipients with PIV infection, with good response in 13 patients.Multiplex PCR testing has become available for multiple respiratory pathogens including influenza A; influenza A subtypes H1, H3, and H1-2009; influenza B; respiratory syncytial virus; parainfluenza viruses types 1\u20134; adenovirus; human metapneumovirus; coronavirus HKU1, NL63, and 229E; enterovirus/rhinovirus; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; Chlamydophila pneumoniae; and Bordetella pertussis.\nIn AIDS patients with PJP, the addition of steroids is recommended if the A-a gradient is >35 or PaO2 < 70; the use of steroids in other immunocompromised patients with PJP who meet these criteria is also recommended.The most effective drug to treat PJP is high-dose trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole; alternatives are clindamycin plus primaquine (test for G6PD deficiency) or pentamidine (much more toxic).The prognosis of PJP in non-HIV-infected immunocompromised patients is worse, most likely due to a delay in diagnosis and a more acute presentation.\n",
