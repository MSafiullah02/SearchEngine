PEDV strains were divided into two genotypes, the G1 genotype (CV777 strain) and the G2 genotype (new variant strains) based on their genome sequences (Lee and Lee, 2014; Wang et al., 2016) . In the present study, three PEDV strains, LNCT2, LNSY, and Hjms, belonging to the G2 genotype were used in a phylogenetic analysis (Suppl. Fig. S1 ). To understand the differences in the PEDV G1 and G2 strains, apart from their genome sequences, we studied the immunogenicity of the newly emerged Chinese strains LNCT2, LNSY, and Hjms, and we compared these G2 strains with the prototypical G1 vaccine strain CV777. Purified PEDV LNCT2 particles were used to immunize BALB/c mice, and a mAb, 1B9, was obtained. Because mAb 1B9 completely neutralized the LNCT2, LNSY, and Hjms strains, while it did not neutralize the CV777 strain, whose S protein sequence differs from that of the G2 strains (Suppl. Fig. S2 ), we inferred that the epitope recognized by mAb 1B9 lies within the S protein or the S1 portion of the S protein. However, because PEDV particles consist of S, membrane, nucleocapsid, and envelope proteins, we were unsure which protein was recognized by mAb 1B9. It is known that the S protein of coronaviruses plays a crucial role in the induction of neutralizing antibodies, and it has been used to prepare effective vaccines (Tuboly Fig. 2 .

To improve the expression level of the S protein, the S gene sequences of the CV777 and LNCT2 strains were codon optimized using a 'one amino acid-one codon' strategy, without changing their amino acid sequences (Wang et al., 2016; Zylicz-Stachula et al., 2014) . The results showed that mAb 1B9 only reacted with cells that were transfected with pcDNA3.1(-)-CV777-S or pcDNA3.1 (-)-LNCT2-S. These results suggested that the epitope recognized by mAb 1B9 lies within the S protein. To determine whether the epitope lies within the S1 or S2 regions of the S protein, the plasmids pcDNA3.1(-)-CV777-S1, pcDNA3.1(-)-CV777-S2, pcDNA3.1(-)-LNCT2-S1, and pcDNA3.1(-)-LNCT2-S2 were transfected into HEK293T cells, and then mAb 1B9 binding to cells. However, only a polyclonal antibody reacted with the S1 and S2 regions. To exclude the possibility that the epitope lies at the junction of the S1 and S2 regions, we designed 150-bp repetitive sequences in the S1 and S2 portions of the LNCT S gene, and 114-bp repetitive sequences in the S1 and S2 portions of the CV777 S gene (Table 1) . Based on these results, we are sure that the S protein is the target of mAb 1B9. Furthermore, the epitope recognized by mAb 1B9 is a conformational epitope, because it did not react with viral particles by Western blot or with the partial S proteins expressed by the transfected cells by IFA. And the partial S proteins expressed by the transfected cells might alter the conformation of the epitope. Although mAb 1B9 recognized the S protein of the CV777 and LNCT2 strains, it did not neutralize the CV777 virus, suggesting that differences in the S protein sequence between CV777 and LNCT2 might play an important role in epitope recognition or neutralization. Such differences in the S protein sequence likely alter the immunogenicity of S protein, thereby resulting in a different neutralization profile. Thus, the PEDV G1 and G2 Fig. 3 .
