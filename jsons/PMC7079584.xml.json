            "text": "Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is a causative agent of diarrhoea in neonatal calves, winter dysentery in adult cattle and respiratory tract illness in cattle of all ages, leading to serious economic losses [1]. In addition to infecting cattle, BCoVs have the potential for interspecies transmission to wild ruminant animals [2\u20134], including caribou [5], white-tailed deer [6], waterbuck [6], elk [7], alpaca [8], giraffe [4] and sambar deer [9], given that wild ruminant coronaviruses (CoVs) are biologically, antigenically and genetically similar to bovine CoVs from domestic cattle [8\u201310]. Additionally, a CoV strain named HEC 4408 was isolated from a diarrhoeic sample from a child in Germany, the genome of which revealed that the strain was more closely related to BCoVs than to other human (H)CoVs, indicating that the strain might have originated from BCoV [11]. Dual pneumoenteric tropism is a common feature of BCoV [12]; a recent study also suggested that human nasal mucosa can temporarily carry BCoV RNA after exposure to virus-shedding calves [13]. These results indicate that the public health impact of BCoVs needs to be further investigated.",

Host species-specific mutations involving deletion in the variable region of the S1 subunit (from amino acid 543 to amino acid 547) were detected in giraffe CoV [14], but the genomic features of CoV detected in other wild ruminants could not be discriminated from BCoV [2, 10]. The BCoV virion contains five structural proteins: the spike (S) protein, the haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein, the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the transmembrane (M) protein and the small envelope (E) protein [15]. The S protein is important for viral entry and pathogenesis, and it is divided into the S1 (N-terminus) and S2 (C-terminus) subunits. S1 is the globular subunit; it is responsible for virus binding to host cell receptors and the induction of neutralizing antibody expression and haemagglutinin activity. S2 is the transmembrane subunit; it is required to mediate the fusion of viral and cellular membranes [16]. The HE protein has been shown to possess an esterase receptor-destroying activity that may be important for virus entry, and it may also serve as a second viral attachment protein (in addition to the large S protein) for the initiation of infection [17]. The evolution of CoVs is facilitated by their high mutation rates, inter- and intra-host selection and recombination frequency, as well as by selection pressure on genetic diversity and genetic drifts during transmission bottlenecks [18\u201320], all of which may lead to changes in the virulence, tissue tropism and host range of these viruses [21, 22].",

The yak is an indispensable animal for the local people in the Qinghai\u2013Tibet Plateau, providing meat, milk, skins, transport and fuel (faeces) [24]. Diarrhoea is a common disease in yaks; however, there is still limited information on diarrhoea pathogens in these animals because of the harsh natural environment, inconvenient travel and fragmented veterinary services in the Qinghai\u2013Tibet Plateau [25].

In this study, approximately 69.05 % of diarrhoeic samples were detected as BCoV-positive by RT-PCR, which indicates that BCoV plays an important role in yak diarrhoea in the Qinghai\u2013Tibet Plateau. Furthermore, BCoV-positive samples were distributed across all 29 farms located in the 4 main yak-production areas in China (the geographical distance between the two furthest farms is >1500 km), which suggests that BCoVs have been circulating widely among yaks in China. Although the epidemiological data for BCoV in cattle in China are still not clear, the presence of BCoV in dairy cattle in China has been confirmed (GenBank accession numbers KU886219.1 and KM985631). Thus, it is possible that the BCoV in yaks was transmitted from BCoV in dairy cows.

Interestingly, unique amino acid variations were observed at three sites (P501A, T540I, and T544A) in the S gene of strain YAK/HY24/CH/2017, and these may be a means by which BCoV adapts to using yaks as a host.

To date, in the genus Betacoronavirus, only MHV had reportedly undergone a nonhomologous recombination event in the HE gene, and this recombination may affect its function [36]. Recombination has also been observed in the HE gene of influenza C virus and toroviruses [37, 38]. Recombination in the HE gene may be a strong driving force for the generation of strains with new genotypes, host spectra and tissue tropisms [36\u201338]. Interestingly, a recombination event was predicted between the esterase and lectin domains of the HE gene of the isolated BCoV strain YAK/HY24/CH/2017. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of a recombination event in a BCoV HE gene. Further analysis of the 40 partial HE genes cloned in this study showed that four strains (GenBank accession numbers MH741325, MH741328, MH741329 and MH741332), including strain YAK/HY24/CH/2017 from Sichuan province, were predicted as recombinant strains. Thus, the prevalence of HE-recombination BCoV strains should be monitored going forward. Additionally, an identical HE recombination event was also predicted in strain AKS-01 from a Chinese dairy cow in this study. It is possible that the BCoV strain with HE recombination found in yaks was originally transmitted from BCoV in dairy cows.",
