Disease is mostly limited to the upper airways and is self-limiting, but a small percentage can progress to lower respiratory tract infections as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Children and elderly people are at increased risk, especially in developing countries. Childhood pneumonia is the leading single cause of mortality in children aged less than 5 years. The incidence in this age group is estimated to be 0.29 episodes per child-years in developing countries and 0.05 episodes per child-years in developed countries. This translates into about 156 million new episodes each year worldwide, of which 151 million episodes are in the developing world. Pneumonia is responsible for about 19% of all deaths in children aged less than 5 years, of which more than 70% take place in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. On the other side of the age spectrum, pneumonia is also a major cause of morbidity and mortality in older people, with an annual incidence for non-institutionalized patients estimated at between 25 and 44 per 1000 population \u2013 up to four times that of patients younger than 65 years of age.",

Key amino acids in these proteins, particularly in HA, are associated with host specificity and transmissibility in humans. Aquatic birds are the natural reservoir of influenza A viruses, harboring all possible subtypes. A selection of subtypes has established endemicity among a range of land and water mammals (e.g. humans, pigs, horses, seals; Fig. 29.1\n). Influenza B and C viruses are mainly human pathogens, with rare reports of influenza B virus infection in dogs, cats, swine and seals. Influenza C rarely causes human infections and will not be further discussed.",

One exception was the re-introduction of H1N1 in the human population in 1977, which was possibly caused by an escape from a research laboratory. Since 1977, two lineages of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A viruses have been co-circulating among humans, causing yearly seasonal epidemics worldwide (Fig. 29.2\n).

In contrast, H5N1 avian influenza viruses have caused severe human respiratory illness in Asia and North Africa, with a mortality of over 50%. Highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses were first detected in birds in 1996 in China. Transmission to 18 humans occurred in Hong Kong, six of which were fatal. During the next 6 years, no human or animal cases were recorded. In 2003, the virus re-emerged in China. Since then, it has become panzootic among poultry and wild birds and, at the time of writing, has caused 584 sporadic infections (345 fatal) in humans, most of whom reported close contact with wild birds or domestic poultry. Despite their worldwide presence for many years, and the huge human\u2013animal interface in Asia, no efficient human-to-human transmission episodes have been recorded.
