Approximately half of the mortality in dairy calves up to 1 month old has been attributed to diarrhoea (Brickell et al., 2009). Diarrhoea in calves has many causes including infectious agents. The four pathogens most often associated with the disease are the protozoal parasite Cryptosporidium parvum, the viruses rotavirus and coronavirus, and enterotoxigenic strains of the bacteria Escherichia coli (Cho and Yoon, 2014). Other viral pathogens which have a less well defined association with calf diarrhoea include bovine torovirus, bovine calicivirus and bovine astrovirus.",

The family is divided into the two genera Mamastrovirus and Avastrovirus based on their mammalian and avian host species, respectively. Astroviruses have long been recognised as an important cause of paediatric diarrhoea in human infants (reviewed in (Moser and Schultz-Cherry, 2005)); however, their role in enteric disease in other species is less clear. A diverse range of AstVs have been detected in faecal samples from diarrhoeic (Englund et al., 2002; Snodgrass et al., 1979; Toffan et al., 2009; Xiao et al., 2013) and healthy animals (Luo et al., 2011; Ng et al., 2013; Reuter et al., 2011; Tse et al., 2011) from a wide variety of species; however, their presence has only been convincingly linked with enteritis in mink and turkeys (Behling-Kelly et al., 2002; Englund et al., 2002). Further studies are required to define the role of AstV as a causative agent of diarrhoea in other species.",

There have also been reports that particular AstVs differ in their tissue tropism with some being associated specifically with neurological disease in humans (Quan et al., 2010), mink (Blomstrom et al., 2010), and cattle (Bouzalas et al., 2014; Li et al., 2013).",

Early studies suggested that these viruses were non-pathogenic in calves upon challenge (Bridger et al., 1984) but could exacerbate disease when calves were co-infected with rotavirus (Woode et al., 1984). Recent studies have described detection of AstV at a low prevalence in the faeces of adult cattle in Hong Kong (Tse et al., 2011) and calves in Korea (Oem and An, 2014). The latter study re-raises the potential pathogenic role of these viruses as detection was restricted to diarrhoeic samples. In order to examine the prevalence, diversity and disease associations of bovine AstV we analysed faecal samples from healthy calves, diarrhoeic calves and healthy adult cattle from farms in South West Scotland.",

The presence of AstV was tested for using a nested RT-PCR which amplifies the AstV RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. Faecal samples were collected from 45 healthy calves from 5 dairy farms with no reported calf diarrhoea at the time of sampling and 70 calves with clinical signs of diarrhoea from 36 dairy farms. Faecal samples were also collected from 20 adult cattles with no recent history of diarrhoea. AstV was detected in a high proportion of both healthy and diarrhoeic calves (29 out of 45 (64.4%) and 56 out of 70 (80.0%), respectively). In contrast to the results from calves, AstV was uncommon in older cattles from the herds examined, being detected in only 3 out of 20 adult cattles (15.0%) none of which had signs of diarrhoea (Fig. 1(a)). We also investigated the presence of rotavirus Group A (RVA), a common cause of calf diarrhoea (Dhama et al., 2009), by analysing the faecal samples from healthy and diarrhoeic calves for RVA using PCR directed against highly conserved sequences in the RVA segment VP1. RVA RNA was detected in 8 out of 45 healthy calves (17.8%) and 54 out of 70 diarrhoeic calves (77.1%) (Fig 1(a)) revealing, as expected for this well characterised enteric pathogen (Castrucci et al., 1994; Holland, 1990), an association between RVA and diarrhoea.",

However, AstV was also found to be strongly associated with RVA (Fig. 1(b)), which could therefore be acting as a confounding factor. Indeed, after adjusting for the presence of RVA using a Mantel\u2013Haenszel adjusted odds ratio the relationship between AstV and diarrhoea was no longer statistically significant (Fig. 1(b)). To examine this further a multivariable model was developed to estimate the association between AstV and diarrhoea after adjusting for both RVA and animal age using a Firth logistic regression model (Table 1). The model suggests that adult animals have a lower odds of having diarrhoea (OR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.004\u20130.459) and that animals with RVA presence have \u223c15 (OR = 14.6: 95% CI 5.80\u201341.2) times the odds of having diarrhoea compared to those without. After adjusting for age and the presence of RVA there was no statistically significant association with the presence of AstV (p-value = 0.855). We also tested for any evidence of a statistical interaction/effect modification between the two viruses but this was not significant and not included for simplicity. Importantly, the multivariable model is in agreement with the Mantel\u2013Haenszel adjusted odds ratio, revealing that after adjusting for RVA and age, there is no statistically significant association between diarrhoea and AstV.",

In order to determine if particular bovine AstVs are differentially associated with calf diarrhoea, amplicons from AstV PCRs selected to represent all positive farms and a variety of amplicon intensities were cloned and sequenced. A total of 209 individual clones from 48 amplicons (1\u20138 clones per amplicon from 28 diarrhoeic calves, 17 healthy calves and 3 healthy adults) were sequenced. Primer sequences were trimmed and a 220 nucleotide region equivalent to nucleotides 3316\u20133535 in the bovine AstV sequence HQ916313 was used for further analysis. 76 unique sequences were identified from the 209 clone sequences analysed. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences revealed the presence of three distinct viral lineages (Fig. 2) with varying degrees of relatedness to previously described AstV from cattle, deer and pigs. The overall diversity of clones from healthy and diarrhoeic calves was similar with comparable numbers of clones from these two sample sets in the three viral lineages identified. The sequences in each of the three groups were diverse, with those classified as lineage 2 showing the highest variability with a mean pairwise nucleotide divergence across the analysed region of 18.1% compared to 11.9% and 6.2% in lineages 1 and 3, respectively. Pairwise distances between lineages were 30.0% (lineage 1 vs 2), 23.3% (lineage 1 vs 3) and 28.8% (lineage 2 vs 3). While the majority of AstV clones from a single individual contained identical or closely related sequences, there were three cases (Fig. 2, nodes marked *, + and #) where sequences of multiple lineages were cloned from a single individual\u2019s PCR amplicon indicating concurrent infection with multiple, diverse AstVs. Overall, many different AstVs were found in the faeces of calves; however, no association of a particular lineage with calf diarrhoea was identified.",

Two calves (calves A and B) died from diarrhoea during the study while the third calf (calf C) survived. All 3 individuals remained AstV PCR positive over the sampling time. The relationship between the most prominent viruses detected at each time point was determined by phylogenetic analysis of 4\u201315 clones per sample (Fig. 3). In calf B, viral sequences detected at initial sampling and at time of death (15 days after initial sampling) were highly similar differing in, at most, 1 out of 223 nucleotides. Calf A, however, showed a complete change from detecting lineage 3 sequences on initial sampling (15 out of 15 clones) to detection of lineage 1 sequences at time of death (8 out of 8 clones). Calf C survived throughout the sampling period. No significant change was seen in viral sequences detected from samples on the 29th November, 17th December and 20th December with all being within lineage 3 and differing at most by 5 out of 223 nucleotides. However, from the sample taken on the 28th of December, lineage 1, 2 and 3 sequences were detected, demonstrating a clear mixed infection. From the sample collected on the 10th of January only lineage 2 sequences were detected. Overall these results show marked variation in the AstVs in the faeces of a single animal over time, with different AstVs present at different times and presence of multiple AstV lineages at the same time.

By sequencing sequential samples from the same animals, we have shown AstV infection to be highly dynamic with different AstVs present in the same animal concurrently and sequentially. It is unclear whether this absence of genotypic consistency is due to constant re-infection with viruses from different lineages, differential shedding of certain lineages over time or detection of non-infecting viruses acquired through dietary contamination. Our ability to classify the viral sequences detected was restricted by the limited size of the screening amplicons; however, further characterisation of complete genomes from these viruses will better inform classification and investigate the potential for recombination given the detection of concurrent infection with multiple AstV lineages. The use of the more specific PCR in this study compared to the published pan AstV assay (Chu et al., 2008) may have resulted in a restriction of viral lineages detected although the diversity of sequences reported here and obtained in an initial screen of these samples with the published assay was comparable (data not shown). Importantly, no sequences identified in the initial screen were shown to cluster with the recently described bovine neurotropic AstV (marked with red node labels in Fig. 2) (Bouzalas et al., 2014; Li et al., 2013) indicating that this lineage of viruses may have a more restricted prevalence or different tissue tropism.",

Co-infection with AstV and other enteric pathogens has been reported previously in calves (Oem and An, 2014; Woode et al., 1984) and humans (Afrad et al., 2013; Li et al., 2010), and our study found that presence of AstV and RVA in calf faeces were strongly associated. We were unable to determine if this association is causal, for example if AstV presence predisposes calves to RVA infection or vice versa, or the clinical significance of the association for example if AstV potentiates the severity of diarrhoea caused by RVA, as has been reported experimentally (Woode et al., 1984). Definitive determination of bovine AstV as an enteric pathogen, either singly or in combination with another pathogen such as RVA, would require viral isolation and experimental infections under natural conditions. However, our study, with the important inclusion of age and geographically matched controls, found no evidence that detection of AstV, or even specific AstV lineages, in the faeces of calves is associated with diarrhoea.",
