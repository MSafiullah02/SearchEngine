Chlamydia trachomatis, a sexually transmitted disease passed on during birth, is also important (2, 3) . Recently, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panels that include other respiratory bacteria have been implemented in clinical practice. Several studies have indicated that the atypical pathogens Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae can cause community-acquired LRTIs in older children (4, 5) , but their role in young infants remains largely unknown.",

They were treated in the paediatric emergency room at Oulu University Hospital, Finland, from December 7, 2016 to December 6, 2017. The Regional Ethics Committee of Northern Ostrobothnia Hospital District, Oulu, Finland, provided ethical consent (EETTMK 98/2016), and written informed consent was obtained from the children's legal guardians. They completed a standard questionnaire about the infant's current illness and clinical characteristics, and laboratory data were collected from hospital records. Pregnant women did not undergo universal Chlamydia trachomatis screening during the study period or routinely receive the acellular pertussis vaccines. We regarded it as clinically significant, that is, that testing for both Chlamydia trachomatis and Bordetella pertussis would be clinically indicated in all young infants with an LRTI, if 5%, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 2.5-7.5%, were caused by these pathogens. The study sample size, with a two-sided alpha error of 0.05, was 169 infants, but we decided to collect samples for at least 12 months to represent a complete epidemiological year. The study comprised 228 infants with LRTIs with a median age at presentation of 70 days (range: 6-174). Most (89%) had viral respiratory tract infections (95% CI: 84-93%), notably respiratory syncytial viruses (34%), rhinoviruses (29%) and parainfluenza viruses (11%; Table 1 ).",
