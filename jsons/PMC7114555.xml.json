Four genera have thus far been described in the subfamily Coronavirinae and these include: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus (Masters and Perlman, 2013). Five porcine CoVs have been recognized: transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in the Alphacoronavirus genus; porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) in the Betacoronavirus genus; and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) in the Deltacoronavirus genus.",

But the clinical significance of PDCoV was not addressed in that study. In February 2014, emergence of PDCoV in U.S. swine was reported and the virus rapidly spread to multiple states in the U.S. (Li et al., 2014, Marthaler et al., 2014a, Marthaler et al., 2014b, Wang et al., 2014a, Wang et al., 2014b, Wang et al., 2014c). Shortly thereafter, PDCoV was detected in the South Korean swine population (Lee and Lee, 2014). Recently PDCoV has also been detected in mainland China and Thailand (Chen et al., 2015a, Janetanakit et al., 2016, Song et al., 2015, Wang et al., 2015). PDCoV was reported to be associated with naturally infected clinical cases that were presented with severe diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration in piglets (Janetanakit et al., 2016, Li et al., 2014, Song et al., 2015, Wang et al., 2014a) together with histopathological lesions typical for atrophic enteritis (Wang et al., 2016). Experimental infection studies have confirmed that conventional and gnotobiotic piglets inoculated with PDCoV developed mild to severe diarrhea, gross and microscopic intestinal lesions (Chen et al., 2015b, Jung et al., 2015, Ma et al., 2015).",

            "text": "PDCoV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a genome of appropriately 25 kb in length. The PDCoV genome organization and nucleotide locations are depicted in Fig. 1\n. The genome arrangements are in the order of: 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), open reading frame 1a/1b (ORF1a/1b), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nonstructural protein 6 (NS6), nucleocapsid (N), nonstructural protein 7 (NS7), and 3\u2032 UTR. The functions of PDCoV individual proteins have not been elucidated. But according to studies on other CoVs, the replicase polyproteins 1a (pp1a) and pp1ab are generally cleaved by virus-encoded proteases into 16 non-structural proteins involved in viral transcription and replication (Masters and Perlman, 2013). Among the structural proteins, the S glycoprotein of CoVs generally functions in receptor binding, cell membrane fusion and entry; in addition, the S protein is postulated to harbor epitopes to induce neutralizing antibodies. In regards to molecular characterization of PDCoV, the whole genome sequences and/or S and N gene sequences have been frequently used for phylogenetic analysis (Homwong et al., 2016, Janetanakit et al., 2016, Lee et al., 2016, Song et al., 2015, Wang et al., 2014a). The S, M and N protein genes have also been targeted for the development of virological and serological diagnostic assays for PDCoV (Chen et al., 2015b, Ma et al., 2015, Marthaler et al., 2014b, Song et al., 2015, Su et al., 2015, Thachil et al., 2015, Wang et al., 2014a).",

Diarrhea occurred on 1 DPI and persisted for 7\u201310 days and all four pigs recovered from disease on 10 DPI.

My group has recently performed an experimental infection study where fifteen 3-week-old conventional pigs were orally inoculated with 105 TCID50 of PDCoV USA/IL/2014 isolate and monitored through 42 DPI with viral RNA shedding levels examined in individual fecal swabs (fecal swabs were collected from each pig at each time point), pen-based feces (two feces were collected at each time point from the floor of the room housing all PDCoV-inoculated pigs), and pen-based oral fluids (two oral fluids were collected at each time point from the room housing all PDCoV-inoculated pigs) (unpublished data). A schematic diagram presenting PDCoV infection dynamics in nursery pigs is summarized in Fig. 2\n. Clinical signs generally did not last over 10 days. Viral RNA shedding peaked on 7 DPI and gradually decreased thereafter no matter in individual fecal swabs, pen-based feces, or pen-based oral fluids. However, duration of viral RNA shedding in these specimen types are different. PDCoV RNA was detected through at least 14 DPI (negative on 21 DPI) in pen-based feces, at least 28 DPI (negative on 35 DPI) in individual fecal swabs, and at least 35 DPI (negative on 42 DPI) in pen-based oral fluids.

            "text": "Based on aforementioned experimental studies, recommendations on sample collections for PDCoV diagnostic testing are provided below.\u2022\nCollection of fecal samples and oral fluids. PDCoV-infected pigs shed high-levels of virus during the acute infection periods (1\u201310 DPI); individual fecal swabs, pen-based feces, and/or pen-based oral fluids can be collected for PDCoV PCR or virus isolation (VI) testing. Oral fluids and individual fecal swabs appear to be better specimen types than pen-based feces for PCR testing when PDCoV infection is already over 10-14 days.\u2022\nSerum samples for PDCoV PCR and VI testing or not? PDCoV infection can induce acute viremia (Chen et al., 2015b, Ma et al., 2015) but viremia is transient and at low-level; thus serum is not the best choice for PDCoV PCR or VI testing.\u2022\nTissue sample collections for PDCoV testing. For sick (clinical) pigs euthanized and necropsied during the acute infection phase (1\u201310 DPI), the small intestines especially the jejunum and ileum sections can be collected freshly for PDCoV PCR and VI testing or can be collected in 10% buffered formalin for histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) examinations. Low-levels of PDCoV RNA has been detected in other non-enteric tissues by PCR but PDCoV antigen has not been consistently detected in those non-enteric tissues by IHC or immunofluorescence staining (Chen et al., 2015b, Jung et al., 2015, Ma et al., 2015); therefore, non-enteric tissues are not the best choice for PDCoV diagnostic testing.\u2022\nFeed or environmental samples for PDCoV testing. A number of PEDV studies have shown that contaminated trailers and feed/ingredients can serve as a vehicle to transmit PEDV (Bowman et al., 2015a, Dee et al., 2014a, Lowe et al., 2014, Pasick et al., 2014, Pillatzki et al., 2015). Since PDCoV probably has the similar transmission routes to PEDV, environmental samples and feed are occasionally submitted for PDCoV PCR testing.\u2022\nSamples for PDCoV antibody testing. No information has been published regarding dynamics of antibody responses against PDCoV infection. According to our unpublished data, PDCoV-inoculated weaned pigs started to develop low-level virus neutralizing (VN) antibody in serum on 7 DPI and VN antibody titers increased from 14 DPI and were maintained through the end of the study (42 DPI; Fig. 2). For PEDV, serum, oral fluid, colostrum and milk samples can be used for antibody detection; it is assumed that these specimens can also be used for PDCoV antibody detection although more research is definitely needed in these areas.\n",

Two EM techniques are commonly used in diagnostic laboratories: negative-stain EM for detection of virus particles in a fluid matrix; ultrathin-section EM for detection of virus particles in fixed tissues or cells. Based on characteristic morphology and size of virus particles observed under EM, viruses can be assigned to appropriate family, e.g. coronavirus-like particles were observed in some feces during initial investigation of diarrheic cases caused by PDCoV. Although EM cannot identify viruses to the species level, identification to the family level can still facilitate next-step testing to achieve definite diagnosis. However, EM generally is less sensitive and needs presence of sufficient amount of virus (about 105\u20136 virions per milliliter) in examined specimens. In addition, EM requires expensive equipment and highly skilled microscopist. EM is not a tool routinely used for PDCoV diagnostic testing.",

Electron microscopy together with pan-coronavirus RT-PCR followed by genetic sequencing played an important role in identifying PEDV and PDCoV during the early stage of investigating diarrheic swine cases in the United States (US) (Li et al., 2014, Stevenson et al., 2013). However, pan-coronavirus RT-PCR is not PEDV- or PDCoV-specific and genetic sequencing of the amplified product is needed to determine virus identity. This property together with the relatively lower sensitivity make pan-coronavirus RT-PCR not suitable for routine PDCoV diagnostic testing.",

Following PCR amplification, electrophoresis on agarose gels and visualization of amplicons under UV light are generally performed to determine the RT-PCR results. The limit of detection of these standard PDCoV RT-PCR assays was not defined in the papers (Song et al., 2015, Wang et al., 2014a). Due to two steps of reaction set up, nested RT-PCR is more prone to contamination and special attention needs to be paid when performing nested RT-PCR.

These rRT-PCR assays target the conserved regions of PDCoV M or N genes with the limit of detection (LOD) of 2 viral RNA copies per reaction for the assay described by Marthaler et al. (2014b) and LOD of 0.056 TCID50 per reaction for the assay described by Chen et al. (2015b) and Zhang et al. (2016) (Table 2). Because of the similarity in clinical symptoms caused by PDCoV, PEDV and TGEV, there is a value to simultaneously detect and distinguish these swine enteric coronaviruses. Zhang et al. (2016) described a duplex real-time PEDV/PDCoV RT-PCR targeting M genes for simultaneous detection and differentiation of PDCoV from PEDV. The LOD of this duplex rRT-PCR is 7 RNA copies per reaction for PEDV and 14 RNA copies per reaction for PDCoV (Table 2). The performance of this duplex PEDV/PDCoV rRT-PCR on testing 170 clinical samples (86 fecal swabs, 24 feces, 19 intestines, and 41 oral fluids) was comparable to that of singleplex PDCoV rRT-PCR and singleplex PEDV rRT-PCR (Zhang et al., 2016). Some commercial multiplex rRT-PCR assays for simultaneous detection and differentiation of PDCoV, PEDV and TGEV have been developed (e.g. EZ-PED/TGE/PDCoV MPX 1.0, Tetracore Inc., Rockville, MD) and used by some veterinary diagnostic laboratories for routine diagnostic testing.",

Some key points about PDCoV rRT-PCRs are listed below.\u2022A variety of specimen types such as feces, rectal swabs, intestinal tissues or contents, oral fluid, environmental samples, feed and so on can be tested for presence of PDCoV RNA by rRT-PCR. Magnetic bead-based reagents and automated extraction on various magnetic particle processors such as Thermo KingFisher, Qiagen BioSprint, and Life Technologies MagMAX Express have been used in many laboratories for high throughput nucleic acid extraction. But nucleic acid extraction procedures need to be optimized based on specimen types.\u2022Proper controls should be included in nucleic acid extraction and PCR reaction setup. For example, positive extraction control (a PDCoV-positive sample that undergoes nucleic acid extraction and PCR reaction), negative extraction control (phosphate buffered saline that undergoes nucleic acid extraction and PCR reaction), positive amplification control (PDCoV-positive RNA for PCR reaction), and negative amplification control (nuclease-free water for PCR reaction) are generally included. In addition, an internal positive control (IPC) such as Xeno\u2122 RNA is recommended to be included. An IPC can be added to every reaction either at the nucleic acid extraction or at the PCR reaction setup step. The rRT-PCR master mix contains primers and probes for the IPC target, thus theoretically the IPC should amplify in every reaction. The absence of IPC amplification may indicate presence of PCR inhibitors in the sample. If both PDCoV and IPC fail to amplify in a sample, PDCoV PCR result is inconclusive and additional testing or resubmission of the sample is recommended.\u2022When rRT-PCR assays reach their limit of detection, interpretation of PCR results could be a challenge.\u2022rRT-PCR has many advantages such as rapid turnaround time between sample receipt and obtaining results, high sensitivity and high specificity, high throughput, multiplexing capability, and capability for genomic quantitation. However, PCR detects viral nucleic acid and does not distinguish live from dead virus in a sample.\n",

The National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) under USDA has isolated PDCoV USA/IL/2014 strain and Michigan/8977/2014 strain in swine testicular (ST, ATCC CRL-1746) cell line (Chen et al., 2015b, Ma et al., 2015); however, detailed isolation protocols have not been published. To present, only one published paper has described primary PDCoV isolation from clinical samples in cell cultures in detail (Hu et al., 2015). They reported successful isolation and propagation of PDCoV OH-FD22 strain in LLC-PK1 cell line (ATCC CCL-101) and ST cell line. PDCoV cytopathic effects (CPE) in LLC-PK1 and ST cells are similar and are characterized as enlarged, rounded, granular cells followed by cell detachment (Hu et al., 2015). It was found that PDCoV OH-FD22 replicated in LLC-PK1 cells in the absence of trypsin, but virus titer was about 10,000-fold lower than that with trypsin (5 log10 PFU/ml vs 9 log10 PFU/ml); also, no visible CPE was observed without trypsin (Hu et al., 2015). Addition of small intestinal contents (SIC) from Gn pigs together with trypsin (SIC + trypsin) or addition of pancreatin alone to the culture medium resulted in PDCoV titer of 7 log10 PFU/ml which was about 100-fold lower than that with trypsin (9 log10 PFU/ml) (Hu et al., 2015). Therefore, the optimized culture conditions for PDCoV OH-FD22 propagation in LLC-PK1 cells are advanced MEM (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibo), 1% nonessential amino acids (Gibo), 1% HEPES (Gibo), and 10% trypsin (Gibco) (Hu et al., 2015). Interestingly, it was found that trypsin did not support PDCoV OH-FD22 propagation in ST cells; in contrast, PDCoV propagated efficiently in ST cells when 10% Gn pig SIC or 1% pancreatin was added (Hu et al., 2015). The optimized culture conditions for PDCoV OH-FD22 propagation in ST cells are advanced MEM supplemented with 1% antibiotic-antimycotic, 1% HEPES, and 1% pancreatin (Sigma, USA) (Hu et al., 2015). The mechanisms of beneficial effects of trypsin or pancreatin on PDCoV propagation in LLC-PK1 or ST cells remain unknown. However, it is noteworthy that the PDCoV USA/IL/2014 strain and Michigan/8977/2014 strain propagate well in ST cells grown in MEM containing 5 \u03bcg/ml trypsin 250 (BD Biosciences) or DMEM containing 0.2 \u03bcg/ml TPCK-trypsin (Invitrogen) (Chen et al., 2015b, Ma et al., 2015).",

In fact, the low success rate of PDCoV VI is similar to what has been observed for PEDV VI. In two studies (Chen et al., 2014, Oka et al., 2014 Oka et al., 2014), PEDV VI was successful in 2 out of 50 and 9 out of 88 PEDV PCR-positive samples, respectively; in addition, PEDV was only successfully isolated from intestinal homogenates or contents but not from fecal samples in those two studies. However, in a recent study, 3 PEDVs were successfully isolated in cell culture from feces (Chen et al., 2016a). In another study, PEDV VI from 68 clinical samples was unsuccessful; but after one clinical sample (intestinal homogenate) was inoculated into pigs, PEDV was successfully isolated from fresh intestinal homogenates and cecum contents collected from the inoculated pigs (Chen et al., 2016b). It is speculated that high concentration of virus and immediate VI attempts on the fresh samples are the key to success of VI in cell culture. This approach can be considered for PDCoV VI as well when there is a difficulty to isolate PDCoV directly from clinical samples.",

For PEDV, swine bioassay has been commonly used to assess infectivity of PEDV present in various samples, including feed and feed ingredients after disinfectant or other treatments (Bowman et al., 2015b, Dee et al., 2014b, Dee et al., 2015). Notably, some samples were PEDV VI negative after treatment but swine bioassay positive (Dee et al., 2015), emphasizing the importance and necessity of performing swine bioassay to reliably determine virus infectivity of a sample. Based on some PEDV study, a neonatal pig bioassay is more sensitive than a weaned pig bioassay to assess PEDV infectivity and a 7-day duration would be appropriate for PEDV swine bioassay (Thomas et al., 2015). There have not been reports on PDCoV swine bioassay, but experience and knowledge learned from PEDV studies could possibly be applied to PDCoV.",

Then serum samples to be tested are added to the plates to bind to the virus antigen followed by addition of fluorophore-conjugated anti-swine secondary antibody and visualization under a fluorescence microscope. IFA assay can be used for detection of PDCoV antibody in a qualitative manner (determination as positive or negative) or in a quantitative manner (determination of antibody titer). To determine PDCoV antibody titer, test serums are serially two-fold diluted and incubated with PDCoV-infected cell plate(s); the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum that still gives positive fluorescent staining is considered as the antibody titers. Theoretically, IFA antibody isotype can be determined by using different types of secondary antibody; however, for most occasions, IFA assay is used to determine IgG antibody. IFA assay is not automated and is subjective with respect to result reading and reporting. Dynamics of PDCoV IFA antibody production and duration has not been well defined and correlations of PDCoV IFA antibody to other serological assays are unknown at this point.",

Subsequently, the virus-serum mixture is added to ST or LLC-PK1 cells and incubated at 37 \u00b0C. The endpoint determination of neutralizing antibody can be based on viral CPE development (conventional VN test) or based on fluorescence staining (this format of VN test is also called fluorescent focus neutralization [FFN] assay). CPE-based VN test needs to wait until a viral CPE has fully developed in the virus control wells and generally takes 3-4 days. Sometimes serum cytotoxicity can be mistaken as viral CPE, making it difficult to interpret the results. For FFN assay, the cell plates inoculated with virus-serum mixture are generally incubated for 24\u201348 h and then stained with a FITC-conjugated monoclonal antibody against PDCoV N protein (Medgene labs). The reciprocal of the highest serum dilution resulting in >90% reduction of fluorescent staining as compared to the negative serum control is considered as the neutralizing antibody titer of the serum sample. For another closely-related swine enteric coronavirus, PEDV, virus neutralization assay in the FFN format has been frequently used (Okda et al., 2015, Thomas et al., 2015). VN assays (both conventional CPE-based and FFN) are labor intensive, requiring manual reading and interpretation of the results. VN assays detect neutralizing antibodies but do not determine the antibody isotypes. So far, there have been no publications describing dynamics of PDCoV VN antibody production and duration. We have some preliminary data showing that PDCoV VN antibody was detected from 7 DPI through 42 DPI (the end of the study) in PDCoV-inoculated weaned pigs (unpublished). But correlations of PDCoV VN antibody to other serological assays have not been determined yet.",

The PDCoV S1 protein-based ELISA was validated using 210 field serum samples and had a diagnostic sensitivity of 90.6% and a diagnostic specificity of 94.8% when the clinical exposure history and PDCoV PCR testing on fecal samples were used to reflect the true PDCoV serological status of those farms from which serum samples were collected (Thachil et al., 2015). The PDCoV N protein-based ELISA was validated using 62 serum samples and had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 90.4% when compared to the Western blot results on the same 62 serum samples (Su et al., 2015). The PDCoV whole virus-based ELISA was validated using a few immune sera generated from Gn pigs that were immunized intramuscularly twice with inactivated PDCoV; diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were not provided in the paper (Ma et al., 2016). The optical density (OD) of ELISA is determined using ELISA plate reader and the sample-to-positive (S/P) ratios are calculated accordingly if S/P ratios are used to determine ELISA results. ELISA is considered a relatively objective assay. ELISA is a high throughput assay and is suitable for testing a large number of samples. In addition, ELISA can be used to measure antibody isotypes (e.g. IgG, IgA, and IgM) in various specimen types. For example, PEDV ELISAs have been used to detect IgG and/or IgA antibodies in serum, oral fluid, and feces samples (Bjustrom-Kraft et al., 2016, Gerber et al., 2014, Gerber and Opriessnig, 2015).

For the FMIA, up to 100 color-coded bead sets (fluorescent microspheres) can be used and each bead set can be conjugated to individual antigens for the detection of antibodies in biological samples. One apparent advantage of FMIA is that it allows simultaneous detection of antibodies to multiple pathogens present in a single sample. A FMIA based on PEDV N protein has recently been developed for the detection of PEDV antibody in serum samples (Okda et al., 2015). The FMIA for the detection of PDCoV antibody has not been reported but it is expected that the FMIA technology can be successfully applied to detect PDCoV antibodies.",

Distribution and prevalence of PDCoV in China have not been determined nationwide but some local prevalence data have been reported. In one study, among 356 samples (170 fecal samples from sows or piglets less than 10 days old and 186 intestinal samples from piglets less than 10 days old) that were collected during November 2012 to March 2015 from diarrheic pigs on 51 farms in Jiangxi province, China and tested by PCRs, 120 (33.71%) samples were PDCoV positive, 231 (64.89%) were PEDV positive, 0 were positive for TGEV, and 70 (19.66%) were positive for both PDCoV and PEDV (co-infected); of the 120 PDCoV-positive samples, 70 (58.33%) were co-infected with PEDV (Song et al., 2015). In another study, 215 intestinal or fecal samples collected during 2004\u20132014 from diarrheic piglets in four provinces (Anhui, Guangxi, Hubei and Jiangsu) of China were tested by PCRs; among them, 14 (6.51%) were PDCoV positive, 110 (51.2%) were PEDV positive, 5 (2.3%) were TGEV positive, and 2 (0.9%) were co-infected with PDCoV, PEDV and TGEV; of the 14 PDCoV-positive samples, 7 (50%) were co-infected with PEDV (Dong et al., 2015). These studies suggest that PDCoV prevalence in Chinese swine is lower compared to PEDV infection and PDCoV co-infection with PEDV is common. Interestingly, one study also showed that PDCoV RNA was detected as early as in 2004 from diarrheic pig samples collected in Anhui province, China (Dong et al., 2015). This is the earliest date that PDCoV RNA was detected in pigs worldwide.",

In one study, 293 porcine samples collected during January 6 to February 27, 2014 from 7 U.S. states (Ohio, Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska, Michigan, South Dakota, and Missouri) and Canada were tested by PCRs (Marthaler et al., 2014b). Of 293 samples, 89 (30%) were PDCoV positive and were from Ohio, Illinois, Minnesota, and Nebraska. Of the 89 PDCoV-positive samples, 69 (78%) were co-infected with PEDV, porcine rotavirus A, porcine rotavirus B, or porcine rotavirus C; PDCoV and porcine rotavirus C co-infection was most common (52/89 [58%]) while PDCoV and PEDV co-infection was 29/89 [33%] (Marthaler et al., 2014b). In another study, 435 samples collected during February 7 to April 9, 2014 from 10 U.S. states (Minnesota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Ohio) were tested by PCRs (Wang et al., 2014b). Of 435 samples, 109 (25%) samples from 9 aforementioned states except Maryland were PDCoV positive; of the 109 PDCoV-positive samples, 19 (17%) were co-infected with PEDV (Wang et al., 2014b). Now PDCoV has been present in U.S. swine for over two years since its emergence in February 2014, what is the current prevalence status of PDCoV in U.S. swine? The weekly-updated USDA Swine Enteric Coronavirus Disease (SECD) Situation Report (www.aphis.usda.gov/animal-health/secd), which compiles PDCoV and PEDV PCR testing results from 17 participating National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) laboratories, provides a more accurate and thorough description on swine enteric coronavirus status in U.S. swine. Some key points on PDCoV prevalence based on the report data up to the end of March 2016 are summarized below.\u2022From March 2014 to March 2016, a total of 38,774 biological accessions (not samples; one accession/case could include multiple samples) were tested for PDCoV by PCR and 1092 (2.8%) accessions were PDCoV positive. Distributions of biological accessions tested and the numbers as well as the percentages of PDCoV-positive accessions by month are shown in Fig. 3\nA. During April-September 2014, approximately 1000\u20131500 accessions were tested per month; from October 2014 to March 2016, roughly 1500\u20132000 accessions were tested per month. The percentage of PDCoV-positive accessions ranged from 15.6%-10.2% during March-June 2014; the positive rates dropped to 3.8% in July 2014 and then were kept at low levels ( < 3%) from Aug 2014 to Dec 2015 although slight fluctuation was observed; in January 2016, the PDCoV-positive accession rate increased to 5.5%, consistent with the clinical observations that PDCoV broke on multiple farms in January 2016.\u2022Distributions of 1092 PDCoV-positive accessions by state from where the samples were collected during March 2014-March 2016 are shown in Fig. 3B. The top 7 states that have been PDCoV positive are Iowa (239 positive accessions), Minnesota (199 positive accessions), Illinois (173 positive accessions), Indiana (93 positive accessions), Ohio (77 positive accessions), Michigan (74 positive accessions), and North Carolina (53 positive accessions).\u2022From June 5, 2014, the USDA SECD reports have also included information on premises. During the periods of June 2014 to March 2016, a total of 160, 2523, and 141 premises in the U.S. have been confirmed positive by PCR for PDCoV, PEDV, and PDCoV & PEDV co-infection, respectively. These data indicate that in U.S. swine, prevalence of PDCoV has been much lower than that of PEDV; among PDCoV-positive premises, co-infection with PEDV is common. The confirmed positive premises for SECD (including PEDV, PDCoV, and PDCoV & PEDV co-infection) are further categorized into each production class: 360 SECD-positive Nursery premises, 726 SECD-positive Wean-to-Finish premises, 128 SECD-positive Farrow-to-Finish premises, 786 SECD-positive Finisher premises, 413 SECD-positive Sow/Breeding premises, and 407 SECD-positive premises with Unknown age information.\n",

The 2 Thailand PDCoVs had a 6-nt (TTTGAA) deletion in ORF1a between nt 1738 and 1745 resulting in amino acid changes from SSLKI to SRI as well as a 9-nt (CCGGTTGGT) deletion in ORF1a between nt 2810 and 2820 resulting in amino acid changes from PEPVGKV to PDDV, when compared to Chinese HKU15-44 and U.S. & Korean PDCoVs.

(2007) reported a previously unrecognized coronavirus lineage detected from wild Asian leopard cats and Chinese ferret badgers from samples collected in southern China in 2006. In 2009, Woo et al. (2009b) reported identification of three novel avian coronaviruses in wild birds (bulbul CoV HKU11, thrush CoV HKU12, and munia CoV HKU13). These three novel avian CoVs and CoVs identified from Asian leopard cats and Chinese ferret badgers all belong to the newly established Deltacoronavirus genus (Woo et al., 2010, Woo et al., 2012). In 2012, identification of seven additional novel deltacoronaviruses in pigs and birds were reported (Woo et al., 2012). Among deltacoronaviruses, PDCoV is most genetically similar to CoVs in Asian leopard cats based on available helicase, spike and nucleocapsid gene sequences (Woo et al., 2012). It is unknown how DCoVs were transmitted between small mammals (such as Asian leopard cats and Chinese ferret badgers) and domestic pigs. A model of CoV evolution has been proposed in which bats are the gene source of Alphacoronavirus and Betacornoavirus whereas birds are the gene source of Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus (Woo et al., 2009a, Woo et al., 2012). It is likely that DCoVs are transmitted from wild birds to small mammals and/or domestic pigs. More surveillance and sequence data are needed in order to understand interspecies transmission of DCoVs between wild birds and small mammals, between wild birds and domestic pigs, and/or between small mammals and domestic pigs.",

Rapid diagnosis is critical for the implementation of efficient control strategies against PDCoV. Understanding PDCoV infection dynamics and collecting appropriate specimens at the appropriate time window are also important to obtain reliable diagnostic results. A number of virological and serological methods have been developed and used for PDCoV diagnostic testing. Among the virological methods, PDCoV-specific RT-PCR remains the method of choice for the detection of PDCoV; IHC combined with hematoxylin and eosin staining has also been commonly used to examine histopathological lesions caused by PDCoV; success rate of virus isolation in cell cultures has been low. Serological assays can provide information about previous exposure to PDCoV and also determine antibody responses to infection or vaccination when vaccine(s) are available. So far, kinetics of antibody responses to PDCoV infection and duration of PDCoV antibodies have not been studied in detail; correlations of various serological assays for the detection of PDCoV antibodies have not been established. PDCoV has been detected in several countries e.g. China, US, South Korea and Thailand. Prevalence of PDCoV in these countries is lower compared to that of PEDV. However, among PDCoV-positive samples, co-infection with other enteric pathogen e.g. PEDV is common. PDCoV RNA has been detected in samples collected in 2004 in mainland China. PDCoVs circulating in China have shown some different genetic characteristics as evidenced by phylogenetic and comparative sequence analyses. In contrast, PDCoVs detected in the U.S. and South Korea are genetically closely related and have not shown remarkable genetic changes. PDCoVs detected in Thailand are not very closely related to Chinese, US and Korean PDCoVs. The origin of PDCoV has not been clearly identified. It remains to be determined whether global PDCoVs have the similar pathogenicity.",
