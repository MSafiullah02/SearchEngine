Secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), also known as macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), can similarly result [19]. This is a hyperinflammatory syndrome characterized by a fulminant and fatal hypercytokinemia with multiorgan failure, previously noted in approximately 4% of cases triggered by viral infections [21] and/or sepsis [22]. Cardinal features of sHLH/MAS include unremitting fever, cytopenia\u2019s, low or absent natural killer (NK) cell activity, hepatosplenomegaly, hepatobiliary dysfunction (HBD), coagulopathy, high ferritin levels (\u2265500 ng/ml), fasting triglycerides \u2265265 mg/dl with fibrinogen levels \u2264150 mg/dl; as well pulmonary involvement with ARDS which can occur in up to 50% of patients [19], [23]. This same constellation of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities can be seen in those with fatal complications from COVID-19 [19].",

Pathogenesis is associated with increased activation of macrophages and NK cells [24], where an autocrine loop of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 over-secretion leads to cytokine storm of IL-6, IL-18, ferritin, and interferon-gamma [22]; High ferritin levels have been proposed to be the diagnostic hallmark of MAS, and ferritin measurements within the first 24 hours can be used as a diagnostic biomarker of MAS [25], [26]. Among the cytokines produced, Interleukin-18 also has been shown to diagnostically distinguish and pathogenically promote human and murine macrophage activation syndrome [27]. Among pulmonary involvement in patients with HLH/MAS, dyspnea and cough were the most common symptoms at the onset of the disease, and radiographs revealed interstitial infiltrates with centrilobular nodules, ill-defined consolidation, or localized ground-glass opacities [23]. These are some of the same radiological abnormalities seen in patients who recovered from COVID-19 pneumonia, where initial lung findings on chest CT revealed small subpleural ground glass opacities (GGO) that grew larger with crazy-paving pattern and consolidation up to two weeks after disease onset, eventually being absorbed resulting in extensive GGO and subpleural parenchymal bands [28].",

ARDS is caused by lung inflammation and increased alveolar endothelial and epithelial permeabilities [30] resulting in a protein-rich pulmonary edema with severe hypoxemia and impaired carbon dioxide excretion [31]. The lung injury is primarily due to neutrophil-dependent and platelet-dependent damage to the endothelial and epithelial barriers of the lung, frequently caused by pneumonia [31] Neutrophils can become activated, leading to the release of toxic mediators including reactive oxygen species (ROS), proinflammatory cytokines and procoagulant molecules [31], where further synergistic interaction with platelets increase damage to the lungs [32]. A procoagulant effect with coagulopathy and anti-phospholipid antibodies has recently been reported in patients with Covid-19 [33], and these abnormal coagulation parameters have been shown to be associated with a poorer prognosis in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) [34]. It is therefore important to find ways to decrease free radical oxidative stress (ROS), high levels of inflammatory cytokines and procoagulant pathways triggered by COVID-19 if we are to impact the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with the disease process.",

This would include the constellation of early prodromal symptoms of anosmia, hyposmia, and dysgeusia, along with a fever, sore throat, cough and shortness of breath. There are very few diseases that cause a sudden loss or decreased sense of smell and/or taste. According to the medical literature, approximately 5% of people exhibit functional anosmia primarily caused by senescence[36], where 25% of people above the age of 50 have an impaired sense of smell [37], [38]. Olfactory health can be a measure of the number of medications taken [39], and also directly reflect the overall health of a person, where lowered olfactory abilities seem to be negatively associated with life expectancy and an increased risk of death [40]. This is primarily due to those patients with neurodegenerative diseases, especially Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s disease or Lewy body dementia, who have olfactory loss early on in the course of their disorder, allowing a tentative diagnosis years prior to the arising of motor or cognitive disturbances [41].",

Although the prevalence rates of acute rhinosinusitis with symptoms of nasal obstruction/congestion or nasal discharge (anterior/posterior nasal drip) and facial pain/pressure can range from 6-15% and between 2.7-8% in Western and Asian populations respectively [42], olfactory dysfunction linked to COVID-19 infection seems particular as it is not usually associated with rhinorrhea [43] which is part of the symptom complex of acute rhinosinusitis. Clinical studies from Asia did initially report rhinorrhea along with primary symptoms of a fever, sore throat, cough, dyspnea, sputum production, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, and diarrhea [44], [45], but among a recent case series of 357 COVID-19 patients in Europe, up to 85.6% had olfactory dysfunction and 88% of patients reported gustatory dysfunction related to the infection which was not associated with rhinorrhea [43]. There was also a significant association between both disorders of anosmia and dysgeusia (p < 0.001). Using olfactory and gustatory questionnaires based on the smell and taste component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the short version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements (sQOD-NS) can therefore be useful as an initial screening tool [43] especially when it is linked to a questionnaire evaluating the most prevalent symptoms of COVID-19.

Prevention: Prevention practices that need to be scientifically evaluated are the use of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and ivermectin, which have been shown to have anti-viral effects against COVID 19 in vitro [58], [59], [60], [61] as well as nutraceuticals including zinc, vitamin C and Beta glucan. Zinc-deficiency can lead to an increased susceptibility to a variety of pathogens [62], and zinc supplementation in healthy human subjects has been shown to lower oxidative stress related byproducts [63], inhibit induction of TNF alpha and interleukin 1 beta [64], protect against TNF-\u03b1\u2013induced nuclear factor\u2013\u03ba\u03b2 activation in isolated mononuclear cells [64] and regulate intracellular killing and cytokine production by macrophages [64]. In the immune system, the major role of vitamin C appears to be as an antioxidant, protecting the lungs and host cells against oxidative stress caused by infections [65] as well as helping to increase phagocyte function, the proliferation of T-lymphocytes and the production of interferon, while decreasing the replication of viruses [66], [67]. In one study, Vitamin C was shown to shorten the length of the stay in the ICU and decrease the duration of mechanical ventilation for critically ill patients on respirators [68]. Finally, Beta glucans have been extensively published in the medical literature as having significant immunomodulatory properties [69] and double blind, placebo controlled trials have shown benefit in decreasing the severity of upper respiratory tract infections and lowering monocyte chemotactic protein-1 [70], [71]. For that reason, controlled clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, and/or nutraceuticals including zinc, vitamin C and Beta glucans are needed to evaluate their effects for both prevention and diminishing the severity of clinical symptomatology post exposure. This is critically important since development of a safe and effective vaccine may be months to years away, and effective antiviral approaches could help flatten the curve and prevent infection. Randomized controlled trials of hydroxychloroquine, and or ivermectin, with or without the nutraceuticals zinc, vitamin C, and Beta glucans could be done in association with screening questionnaires/app\u2019s, to potentially detect early symptoms, monitor the clinical course from a distance without using precious hospital resources and upload treatment data to the cloud for large data computing, expediting results.",

Deficiency in red blood cell, serum and alveolar glutathione has been published in ARDS, viral and bacterial pneumonias, resulting from increased levels of free radical/oxidative stress [35], [78]. Oxidative stress can trigger several biochemical pathways including NF- \u03baB, which is a primary target for modulating inflammatory responses [79]. The transcription factor NF-\u03baB regulates multiple aspects of innate and adaptive immune functions, is a pivotal mediator of inflammatory responses, induces the expression of various pro-inflammatory genes, including those encoding cytokines and chemokines, and also participates in inflammasome regulation [80]. In addition, NF-\u03baB plays a critical role in regulating the survival, activation and differentiation of innate immune cells and inflammatory T cells needed to fight viral infections [80]. The pro-inflammatory function of NF-\u03baB has also been extensively studied in macrophages, which are on the front line of an immune response against infections [81], involved in MAS. Prospective randomized, controlled studies are therefore needed to evaluate the role of NFKappaB blockade in order to protect against the effects of COVID-19. Inhibitors to block NFKappaB signaling include N-acetylcysteine (NAC) [82], alpha lipoic acid [83], as well as antioxidants like glutathione [84]. N-acetylcysteine and alpha lipoic acid can help increase production and regeneration of glutathione [85], [86], and deficiency in red blood cell, serum and alveolar glutathione has been found in ARDS [35], as well as viral and bacterial pneumonias [87], resulting from increased levels of free radical/oxidative stress [88]. A randomized controlled trial of blocking NFKappaB and cytokine formation using glutathione precursors (N-acetyl-cysteine [NAC] and alpha lipoic acid) as well as PO/IV glutathione should be performed, along with an evaluation of Nrf2 activators (curcumin, sulforaphane glucosinolate) which have been scientifically proven to lower inflammation [89], [90]. The efficacy of glutathione therapy in rapidly relieving dyspnea associated with COVID-19 pneumonia was recently reported by Horowitz and Freeman in a peer-reviewed journal (under review). Since the Nrf2 pathway plays a pivotal role in inflammation [91] as does the NF-\u03baB pathway and deficiencies in glutathione, these should be explored as part of a multifaceted approach to find effective treatments for COVID-19.",

Randomized controlled trials of using anticoagulant therapy with heparin is urgently required, especially in patients on ventilators who have met certain sepsis induced coagulopathy (SIC) criteria, since anticoagulation treatment has been published to decrease mortality from COVID-19 [92]. The use of acetazolamide also needs to be explored with or without heparin, since increased oxygen delivery to vital organs via carbonic anhydrase inhibition may help improve hypoxia [93], along with the drugs\u2019 ability to reverse metabolic alkalosis and facilitate weaning from mechanical ventilation. Although acetazolamide can improve arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) by increasing ventilation, it is associated with an increased work and cost of breathing. Sildenafil could therefore also be used with acetazolamide to increase SaO2 possibly through a reduction in pulmonary hypertension and interstitial edema, helping to improve ventilation\u2013perfusion matching [94].",

Prevention is especially important since the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated that hundreds of thousands of deaths will occur worldwide [96], with the WHO estimating a global mortality rate greater than 5% [12]. Innovative solutions that have a low risk and high potential yield therefore require scientific validation. A three-part prevention, diagnostic and treatment plan is proposed for addressing the severe complications of COVID-19. Digital monitoring of symptoms to clinically diagnose early exposure and response to treatment; prevention with hydroxychloroquine and/or ivermetin as well as other medications and nutritional therapies that support a healthy immune response; treatment with anti-inflammatory therapies that block NFKappaB and activate Nrf2 pathways, as well as novel therapies that address COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS with DIC, including anticoagulation with or without acetazolamide and sildenafil for those requiring respiratory support. These three hypothetical broad-based clinical interventions have been published in the medical literature to be of potential benefit in those with viral pneumonia and ARDS, with limited data available on their effects on COVID-19. We believe that it is urgent that these hypotheses be tested in a series of randomized, controlled trials to evaluate their ability to flatten the curve and decrease the presently high levels of morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19.",
