            "text": "Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) are considered among the best models of human multiple sclerosis (MS). In both models, clinical disease is characterized by paralysis, while pathological changes consist of inflammatory demyelination. l n both models there is a genetic influence on susceptibilityhesistance to the development of disease. This has been thoroughly studied in TMEV infection, and it has been found to depend on both major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and non-MHC genes. At least four genes have been so far identified. Because of this genetic influence, some strains of mice are more susceptible to both clinical and pathological changes than others, and susceptibility appears to best correlate with the ability of a certain murine strain to develop a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response to viral antigens. We have also observed that even among mice which are equally susceptible clinically, striking differences may be seen under pathological examination. These consist of different gradients of severity of inflammation, particularly in regards to the macrophage component. There is a n inverse relationship between the number of macrophages, and their length of stay in the CNS, and the ability of mice to remyelinate their lesions. The most severe lesions are in SJL/J mice, and remyelination in this strain is extremely poor. The least severe lesions in terms of macrophage invasion are in strains such as NZW and RIIIS/J, and these are able to remyelinate lesions very successfully, Murine chronic relapsing EAE (CR-EAE) shows pathological changes in many ways similar to those in TMEV-infected SJL/J mice, although less severe in terms of degrees of macrophage infiltration and tissue destruction. Mice with CR-EAE have a correspondingly limited ability to remyelinate their lesions. In both models the pathology appears to be mediated through a DTH response. However, while in EAE the DTH response is clearly against neuroantigens, the response in TMEV infection is against the virus itself. The end result in both models would be that of myelin destruction through a lymphotoxincytokine-mediated mechanism. The importance of the DTH response in both models is well illustrated by the effects of tolerance induction in EAE and TMEV infection to neuroantigens and virus, respectively. These are important models of human MS, since the current hypothesis is that a viral infection early in life, on the appropriate genetic background, may trigger a secondary misdirected immune response which could be directed either against myelin antigens and/or possible persistent virus(es). 0 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Viral models such as coronavirus infection in mice and rats, herpes simplex virus types I and I1 infection in mice, canine dystemper in dogs, and visna infection in sheep, among others, are all excellent models, and they have been recently reviewed (Dal Canto, 1990) . In this paper we shall focus on two models we have been studying for the last several years, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)-induced demyelinating disease and murine chronic relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (CR-EAE). These models have similarities as well as differences which we shall try to illustrate. Both models have interesting features, both pathologically and immunologically, that make them among the best models for human MS. We shall develop them in parallel, starting with the TMEV model, and then interweave them as we go along in order to best illustrate some of the most important pathogenetic differences.",

In the wild, it produces an infection of the enteric tract of the mouse and, occasionally, a paralytic disease as well. It is one of the first viruses to be recognized as able to produce a chronic infection, a feature that makes this model a very important tool for investigating mechanisms of viral persistence (Lipton, 1975) . There are two important subgroups of TMEV. One, consisting of GDVII and FA viruses, is highly virulent and produces a fulminant encephalitis resulting in death in less than a week in most animals. The second, called TO group, from Theiler's original, includes the Daniels (DA) and the BeAn 8386 strains, which produce a chronic persistent infection in the CNS, resulting in inflammatory demyelination (Lipton, 1980) . The DA strain also produces an initial, self-limited, distinct phase of grey matter involvement (Dal Canto and Lipton, 1975; Lipton, 1975) , while the BeAn strain involves grey matter in minimal degree. While our initial studies were done using the DA strain, in the last several years we have preferred the use of the BeAn strain, which is tissue culture adapted.",

Multiple genes are involved, both MHC and non-MHC genes, and the loci found to have predominant effects in one strain combination (e.g., C57BL/6 vs. DBA/2) may differ from those in another (e.g., C57BL/6 vs. SWR).

Typical appearance of spinal cord during the acute to subacute phases of demyelination in BeAn-infected SJLiJ mice. Mononuclear inflammatory cells are visible in the leptomeninges (right-hand side of the picture), and a continuous layer of myelin laden macrophages is present in the sub-pial area. Underneath, there is very severe disorganization of the white matter, in which the most striking feature is the presence of very large myelin and lipid-laden macrophages. In the intervening parenchyma, gliosis is observed, and small numbers of naked axons are present (arrow). Acute lesions with this appearance can be observed for many months after infection, since new lesions may form even in the chronic phases of the disease.

In the upper part of the photograph, two axons are observed being demyelinated by the process of vesicular disruption. These axons appear otherwise normal. A macrophage laden with myelin debris is seen in close vicinity of these axons. The macrophage abuts on a greatly expanded extracellular space in which a myelinated axon and some glial processes are immersed. x 28,000. strains have implicated the H-2D locus as well as non-H-2 loci (Bureau et al., 1992) . The reason for difficulties in some of the genetic analyses may be the potential influence of a gene onto another. For example, H-2D exerts an overriding effect over Tmeu-2 near the T cell receptor genes (Kappel et al., 1991) . In some strain comparisons, sex also contributes to differential susceptibility, in that males have a higher incidence of disease than do females (Kappel et al., 1990) .",

(Figs. 1,2). Inflammatory cells aggregate in the subarachnoid space, particularly around meningeal vessels, and extend into the spinal cord by following the perivascular spaces. Eventually, they migrate through the vessel walls and reach the parechyma. These events are very rapid and can generally be observed during the second to third week after infection. Once the inflammatory cells start infiltrating the parenchyma of the spinal cord, severe myelin and considerable axonal compromise begin to appear and quickly worsen thereafter.

            "text": "One feature which is particularly evident in SJL/J mice is the presence of large numbers of macrophages which quickly populate the spinal cord columns (Fig.  2 ). Such macrophages are always present even at the very beginning of demyelinating activity and remain in the parenchyma for extended periods of time. They are generally very large and loaded with lipid droplets as well as more coarse myelin debris. The intervening parenchyma becomes generally hypocellular, with scattered demyelinated axons (Fig. 2) . By light microscopy, one has the impression that the majority of the tissue among the numerous macrophages is mainly consistent of reactive glial processes. By electron microscopy, the process of demyelination is shown to be mainly accomplished by the process of vesicular myelin degeneration, always in close relationship with macrophages (Fig. 3) . As in MS, and in contrast to the DA model, the process of myelin stripping is rather rare, most myelin being apparently dissolved by vesicular destruction (Prineas, 1985; Raine and Scheinberg, 1988) . We and others have interpreted these features as representing myelin destruction by a number of possible soluble effector molecules, liberated by activated lymphocytes and especially by macrophages Hofman et al., 1989; Selmaj and Figs. 9-12. . It is of interest that frequent coated pits and vesicles were observed in monocytic cells (Fig. 4) , closely recalling a process described in MS and EAE (Epstein et al. 1983; Moore and Raine, 1988; Prineas, 1985) . These profiles have been variously interpreted either as the structural representation of receptor-mediated phagocytosis andor a stage in antigen processing. The extracellular space becomes quite expanded, and axons and other structures appear as floating in it. There is very little remyelinating activity in these spinal cords. When present, it is generally carried out by invading Schwann cells (Fig. 51 , although, occasionally, remyelination by oligodendrocytes can be seen (Fig. 6 ). This is another phenomenon paralleling the situation in human MS, where remyelination and demyelination may take place side by side (Prineas, 1985) . In the chronic stage of the disease, the white matter may be severely disorganized, with numerous intersecting glial processes, bundles of collagen fibers, and interspersed scattered demyelinated axons. Macrophages with lipid droplets may be present for months in chronic lesions (Fig. 7) . Interestingly, chronic plaques that may be partially remyelinated, prevalently by Schwann cells, may be side by side with more acute lesions characterized by the presence of numerous macrophages, completely filled with myelin debris (Fig. 8 ). This picture is again strongly reminiscent of the situation in human MS, where, as recently pointed out by Prineas et al. (1993) , new lesions are most often present in or in close proximity to preexisting lesions, a feature of recurrent disease.",

The degree of inflammation is, however, less than in DBA and especially SJL/J mice, and, in particular, macrophages appear to be quickly removed from demyelinated lesions. The end result of this different pattern of lesion production is the presence, on light microscopy, of large aggregates of demyelinated axons, often back to back without intervening glial processes (Fig. 13) . Also, in these mice remyelination is quite active, and, in contrast to the above strains, it is mainly carried out by oligodendroglial cells (Figs. 13-15 ).",

The morphological parameter that seems to best correlate with such pathological differences is the number of macrophages and the extent of time that these cells linger in the diseased tissue. There is in fact a clear gradient in terms of macrophage behavior in these different strains, with the SJL/J mice being the strain showing the most numerous and persistent macrophages in their tissues and, accordingly, the most destructive lesions for both myelin and axons. Remyelination is sporadic in these mice. NZW and RIII/SJ mice are at the other end of the spectrum, with fewer macrophages, which exit the scene more quickly, and with the most purely demyelinating lesions than other susceptible strains. In parallel with less severe destruction, remyelination in these animals is very active. One could argue that macrophages in SJL mice are more numerous and persist longer because lesions are larger. This does not seem to be the case, since lesions showing myelin breakdown and demyelination in both NZW and RIII/SJ mice are at least as large as in SJL mice, often coalescing to occupy entire anterior and lateral columns. It does not appear, therefore, that macrophages are held longer in one strain because of more debris to clear than in other strains; rather, it is possible that differences in immune regulatory responses in different strains may account for different macrophage behavior, which in turn may affect the severity of lesions. These issues are under investigation and are not discussed further in this report. ",

Rodriguez et al. (1985 Rodriguez et al. ( , 1986a Rodriguez et al. ( ,c, 1993 have published extensively on the possible role of CD8' cells in TMEV infection when using the DA strain of the virus. We have focused our attention mainly on the CD4+ T lymphocyte, which in the infection produced by the BeAn strain of TMEV appears to have a central role in pathogenesis. In the following discussion, therefore, we shall limit our comments to the CD4+ cell in BeAn infection. Welsh et al. (1987) found that CBA mice depleted of total T cells or CD4+ cells after infection with the BeAn strain of TMEV but prior to the onset of clinical signs of demyelination exhibited approximately 50% reduced disease incidence. Similarly, studies with SJLIJ mice in our laboratory have shown that monoclonal antibody depletion of CD4 + cells, beginning 10-14 days after infection with the BeAn strain of TMEV, resulted in a decreased incidence of demyelinating disease and a less severe clinical course as well as a slower onset of disease in those mice which eventually became clinically affected (Gerety et al., submitted) . Flow cytometric analysis of the Percoll-purified mononuclear cells in highly susceptible SJL/J mice revealed that approximately half of the cells infiltrating the CNS were macrophages (i.e., esterase positive) and approximately half were T cells (as assessed by staining with anti-CD3 and anti-TcR antibodies) (Clatch et al., 1990) . Fifty to sixty percent of the infiltrating T cells are CD4+ and 40-50% are CD8+. More recently, analysis of the CNS-infiltrating T cells assayed at varying times ranging from 10-120 days post-TMEV infection has revealed that essentially all of the recently activated cells (i.e., those bearing IL-2 receptor) are CD4' (10-20% of the total cells), while less than 1% of the infiltrating CD8+ cells bear IL-2R, suggesting a major role for CD4+ cells in the demyelinating process (unpublished observation).",

For decades, it has also been considered the best experimental model for human MS, although in most species EAE does not reproduce the typical MS features of chronicity and/or relapsing-remitting disease activity. In 1981, a mouse model of chronic relapsing EAE was introduced (Brown and McFarlin, 19811 , and, because of the well-defined immunologic and genetic profiles of the murine system, it has become the most popular autoimmune model for human MS (Brown et al., 1982; Fritz and McFarlin, 1989; Lublin et al., 1981; McRae et al., 1992; Mokhtarian et al., 1984; Pettinelli and McFarlin, 1981; Trotter et al., 1987; Tuohy et al., 1989; van der Veen et al., 1989) As for TMEV, there are murine strains which are susceptible to EAE, as there are strains which are resistant. It is of interest that susceptible mice may respond to different epitopes of either MBP or PLP, the two most effective autoantigens in inducing the disease (Fritz and McFarlin, 1989; Trotter et al. 1987) .

            "text": "After adoptive transfer of CD4 + neuroantigen-specific T lymphocytes, mice come down with initial clinical signs a t 6-8 days after sensitization. The clinical presentation is characterized by a waddling gate, rapidly progressing to ataxia, hind leg weakness, paralysis, and urinary incontinence. This first bout of disease lasts generally 2 weeks, after which time mice recover to a certain degree. The following relapse can be expected after about 4 weeks of injection. More remissions and relapses follow, although less predictably than the first relapse. Pathological Alterations As previously described by Raine et al. (19841, the pathological features of adoptively transferred EAE show less destructive activity than those of active EAE, particularly in regards to axonal pathology (Brown et al., 1982) . However, when compared to other EAE models, such as the chronic guinea pig model (Raine et al., 1974) , CR-EAE in the mouse is generally more destructive to white matter, with resultant more marked reactive gliosis. From this point of view, therefore, the CR-EAE model is intermediate for its severity of destruction between the chronic guinea pig model of EAE and TMEV infection in the SJL/J mouse. Inflammatory infiltrates precede white matter changes and consist of lymphoid infiltrates in meninges, perivascular spaces, and eventually the parenchyma itself. Macrophages are numerous (Fig. 16) , although rarely as numerous as in TMEV infection in SJL/J mice, and, at least in our material, lesions become generally confluent to involve large areas of both anterior and lateral columns. Correspondence with clinical evidence of remitting-relapsing activity is generally good, but pathological changes often precede the clinical presentation of signs by a few days. During the remitting phase of the disease, inflammation subsides and glial processes take much of the space left behind them. Naked axons are present in moderate numbers, and, in our material, they are generally separated by thick collars of glial processes, since, as previously noted, mild to moderate axonal destruction has generally taken place. As in Theiler's infection, macrophages are rather reluctant to leave and remain in the tissues for many weeks, even when lymphoid infiltrates have largely subsided (Fig. 17 ). This is a feature which is also common to human MS, as pointed out by Raine (1991) . It is of interest that Theiler's infection in the SJL mouse al- Fig. 17 .

We first looked at this possibility by comparing the effects of sera and cells from EAE animals and TMEV-infected mice in myelinating and myelinated organotypic cultures (Barbano and Dal Canto, 1984) . Cells were first expanded by culture in the presence of myelin antigens. While EAE sera and cells inhibited myelination and were able to demyelinate organotypic cultures, no effect was noted with sera and cells from TMEV-infected animals. The same sera and cells, in addition, were not able to transfer disease in vivo. These studies strongly suggested that demyelination in Theiler's infection was not due to an EAE-like mechanism.",

Tolerance induction is accomplished by the intravenous injection of spleen cells coupled to the appropriate antigen by the coupling agent ethyl-carbodiamide (ECDI) (Kennedy et al., 1988 ). It appears that ECDI treatment of immune cells interferes with important secondary signals from the antigen-presenting cell to the effector cell, so that the effector cell, rather than being stimulated by contact with antigen, is made anergic. It has been sug-gested that tolerance induction results in a downregulation of IL-2 gene expression in effector T h l cells (Jenkins et al., 1987) . These constitute a subpopulation of CD4+ T cells involved in the development of DTH responses. The state of clonal anergy resulting from the tolerization regimen is long-lasting, antigen-specific, MHC Class 11-specific, and dose-dependent (Kennedy et al. 1988 Miller et al. 1992; Tan et al., 1992) .",

Such downregulatory activity is equally effective in both disease induction and in disease expression. Active EAE, produced by sensitization with whole spinal cord, can be prevented by i.v. injection with spinal cord-coupled spleen cells or with PLP-coupled spleen cells but not with MBP-coupled cells, suggesting that in whole spinal cord homogenates the dominant encephalitogenic epitope is PLP rather than MBP. On the other hand, MBP-induced EAE can only be prevented by tolerization with MBP-coupled spleen cells. Similarly, in passive EAE, tolerization is able to prevent disease only when spleen cells are coupled with either whole myelin or the same antigen against which the cells used to transfer the disease had been induced. Importantly, EAE can be prevented by injecting spleen cells coupled to peptides from myelin antigens, such as MBP 84-104 or PLP 139-151, which are major encephalitogenic peptides in the SJL/J mouse, when adoptive EAE is induced by the respective antigens . Of great interest have also been studies of tolerization in animals with established EAE. They have shown that tolerance induction does not only prevent the induction of EAE, but, once EAE has been established, subsequent relapses may be prevented (Tan et al., 1991) . Interestingly, such tolerization studies in established chronic relapsing EAE have also shown that subsequent relapses of EAE in SJL/J mice may be due to different antigens than the one originally used for disease induction. In other words, these studies have shown that an antigen shift may occur during a demyelinating disease with autoimmune pathogenesis, a finding that may have relevance to human MS as well. Of paramount importance is the fact that tolerance induction prevents the clinical and pathological expressions of disease by abrogating the development of a DTH response to neural antigens. This clearly establishes the role of the DTH response to myelin antigens in the induction of disease. The T h l subset of CD4+ lymphocytes has been recognized as the primary cells capable of mediating such responses.",

DTH in BeAn-infected susceptible SJL/J mice develops within 10-14 days postinfection, preceding the onset of clinical signs, and remains at high levels for a t least 6 months postinfection. TMEV-specific DTH in SJL mice is mediated by CD4+CD8-T cells and is restricted by I-As determinants. Subsequent studies have strongly supported an immunopathologic role for the T h l subset of CD4+ T cells in the pathogenesis of TMEV-induced demyelinating disease. Firstly, TMEV-susceptible mouse strains make an anti-TMEV antibody response which is dominated by the IgG2a isotype, whereas anti-viral IgGl predominates in resistant strains (Peterson et al., 1992 (Peterson et al., , 1993 . The IgG2a and IgGl isotypes are regulated by T h l -and Th2-derived lymphokines, respectively (Finkelman et al., 1990; Mosmann and Coffman, 1989; Snapper and Paul, 1987) . Lastly, we recently demonstrated that the systemic transfer of an SJLIJderived, TMEV-specific CD4+ T cell line resulted in exacerbation of the incidence and severity of disease in mice infected intracerebrally with suboptimal amounts of TMEV, demonstrating the immunopathologic potential of CD4 + cells. This immunopathologic, I-As-restricted T cell line (sTV1) was shown to mediate DTH and to produce IL-2 and proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN-gamma and lymphotoxin in response to antigenic stimulation indicating that it is of the T h l subset (Gerety et al., 1994) .",

As previously noted, autoimmune T cell reactivity against the major myelin proteins, myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP), did not appear to be involved in the induction of demyelination following TMEV infection. Demyelination could not be initiated by transfer of either serum or lymphoid cells from TMEV-infected donors to normal, non-TMEVinfected recipients (Barbano and Dal Canto, 1984) . Neither MBPor PLP-specific T cell responses were detected in SJL/J mice at any time following intracerebral inoculation with TMEV (Miller et al., 1987) . T cells from TMEV-infected mice also do not respond to the peptide fragments of MBP (amino acids 91-104) and PLP (amino acids 139-151) known to define the major encephalitogenic epitopes in SJL/J mice . In keeping with those earlier studies, induction of neuroantigen tolerance in SJL/J mice by using whole spinal cord homogenates (a heterogeneous mixture of myelin and nonmyelin CNS antigens) failed to affect the development of clinical and histologic signs of TMEV-induced demyelinating disease or the accompanying virus-specific CMI and antibody responses . In contrast, as noted earlier, this tolerogenic regimen is extremely effective in reducing the incidence of clinical and histologic signs of MSCH-induced relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and the accompanying neuroantigen-specific DTH responses (Kennedy et al., 1988) . On the other hand, induction of tolerance using intact TMEV virions coupled to syngeneic splenocytes, which specifically anergizes virus-specific T h l responses (Peterson et al., 1993) , results in a dramatic reduction in the incidence and severity of demyelinating lesions and clinical disease in SJLIJ mice subsequently infected with TMEV (Karpus et al., i n press) (Figs. 19, 20) .",

According to this hypothesis, intracerebral inoculation with TMEV leads to a n initial viremia followed by a persistent, low-level CNS infection which can last for virtually the lifetime of the animal (Lipton et al., 1984) . As a consequence of this infectious process, MHC class 11-restricted, TMEV-specific T h l cells clonally expand, either in the periphery andlor locally within the CNS. Subsequent release of proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-gamma and LTITNF-beta) by the T h l cells in the CNS would then lead to the recruitment and activation of monocytes and macrophages which cause myelin destruction by a terminal nonspecific bystander mechanism (Dal Canto and Lipton, 1975) . This hypothesis is also consistent with the characteristic mononuclear cell infiltrates associated with destructive demyelinating lesions and would account for the chronic attraction of host monocyteslmacrophages, the cells in which TMEV is known to primarily persist (Clatch et al., 19901 , to the CNS.",

In human MS, it is not clearly established which antigen(s) is responsible for exciting the immune response eventually leading to myelin destruction. It is hypothesized that a viral infection may indeed initiate the disease process (Poser, 1993) , perhaps in a manner similar to TMEV infection. Whether later on autoimmune responses misdirected against myelin develop is still debated, and there is considerable controversy about a proposed restriction of T cell receptor usage by MBP-specific T cells derived from MS patients (Martin et al., 1992; Chou et al., 1992) .
