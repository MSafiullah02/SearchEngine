Regardless of whether tumours are benign or malignant, if there is rapid progress, severe organ function impairment or a life-threatening situation, such as rupture and haemorrhage of the tumour or severe compression caused by a large tumour, an emergency operation should be considered. A confined operation should be comprehensively evaluated and reasonably arranged according to the local epidemic and hospital situation. Tumour resection after neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be completed in as reasonable an interval as possible if all conditions permit. By contrast, a radical operation should be postponed until the end of the epidemic.",

The prognosis of patients is closely related to how to ensure the standardisation and continuity of chemotherapy and radiotherapy during the pandemic. After chemotherapy, the majority of patients will present with myelosuppression of varying degrees and durations, which will increase the risk of infection. Severe thrombocytopenia may lead to fatal bleeding, and the risk of the patient is even higher due to the blood shortage during the pandemic. Chemotherapy in local hospitals is preferred to reduce population migration. Highdose chemotherapy and other regimens with severe myelotoxicity should be avoided. Dose-reduction chemotherapy is an option if www.nature.com/bjc necessary. In some cases, oral chemotherapy is a feasible choice, especially for palliative treatment. Radiotherapy might cause myelosuppression and increase the risk of infection due to increased exposure. It is recommended that the radiotherapy be postponed if not necessary during the pandemic.",
