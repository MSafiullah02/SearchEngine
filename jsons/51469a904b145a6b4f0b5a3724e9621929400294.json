During the folding process, they are retained in the compartment and their structural quality is checked by the quality control system of the endoplasmic reticulum. A special characteristic that distinguishes viral fusion proteins from most cellular proteins is the extensive conformational change they undergo during fusion of the viral and cellular membrane. Many viral proteins fold in conjunction with and dependent on a viral partner protein, sometimes even synthesized from the same mRNA. Relevant for folding is that viral glycoproteins from the same or related virus families may consist of overlapping sets of domain modules. The consequences of these features for viral protein folding are at the heart of this review.",

For infectivity of enveloped viruses, the primary requirements of viral attachment, fusion and entry need to be fulfilled by at least one of the envelope proteins. For some viruses, all these functions are combined in a single glycoprotein (3 -5) . Examples are the hemagglutinin (HA) of Influenza A Virus (4), Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) G protein (1) and the hemagglutininesterase-fusion (HEF) protein of influenza C (3). Other functions of viral glycoproteins are to destroy the cellular receptor after binding and to mediate immune evasion. In particular, the pox viruses and herpes viruses are known for their numerous strategies to escape the host's immune system (6) . Because RNA viruses have relatively small genomes, they can only afford the essential functions, often merged into even fewer proteins consisting of domains with individual activities.",

Secondary structure elements such as alpha helices and beta strands will start to form as soon as amino acids are strung into a chain. It is not known whether the ribosome channel and the Sec61 translocon allow any conformational changes, but the folding of growing nascent chains in the ER lumen has been well-documented (7, 8) . N-linked glycan chains are added to asparagine residues in consensus glycosylation sequences some 12 -14 residues from the ER membrane (9) , and disulfide bond formation starts early as well. During the folding process, native as well as non-native disulfide bonds may form, a process that is catalyzed by disulfide isomerases in the ER. The unscrambling of wrong cysteine bridges into native ones is assisted by the same enzymes. Competition between disulfide bond formation and glycosylation (10) suggests that folding may start in the translocon. A viral example is the Newcastle disease virus HN protein, in which deletion of cysteines number 13 or 14 allows the use of one additional neighboring glycosylation site (11) .",

The process may take from minutes to days to complete, and during this time the newly synthesized protein is retained in the ER. Purified proteins can fold into the correct conforma-tion in isolation, since the three-dimensional structure is solely determined by the primary amino acid sequence. Correct in vitro folding usually requires low protein concentrations and low temperatures. The crowdedness in the ER at physiological temperatures makes folding assistance invaluable. Folding enzymes such as disulfide isomerases and prolyl-peptidyl cis-trans isomerases catalyze covalent changes that may be rate-limiting to folding. In addition, a large number of molecules act by preventing undesirable interactions between the newly synthesized immature proteins. They are suitably called molecular chaperones (12) .",

The ER folding factors may thus constitute the quality control system of the organelle as well. Up to now, the lectin chaperones are the only ones for which this connection is firmly established (13) . Calnexin and calreticulin themselves serve as retention factors; they do not control the quality of the product they bind. Quality is checked by the enzyme UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, which adds a single glucose to the mannose chain, provided some hydrophobic residues are exposed on the protein in addition to the innermost GlcNAc residue of the glycan (14) . Reglucosylation results in renewed binding to calnexin and calreticulin, which is preceded and followed by glucosidase II-mediated deglucosylation. Alternating glucosidase II and glucosyltransferase activities establish a cycle of binding and release to the lectin chaperones, during which the substrate folds and is checked for structural quality (15) . All proteins with glycan chains that have been examined so far interact with at least one of the lectin chaperones. This suggests that in the choice of a newly synthesized protein for a particular chaperone, the affinity of the lectins for the glycan chain is dominant.",

However, the comparison is difficult to make because literature on the maturation of viral glycoproteins is much more abundant than reports on the folding of cellular glycoproteins. One difference that emerges is the more extensive glycosylation most viral glycoproteins undergo. This could serve to protect the virus and cover potentially immunogenic epitopes. Glycosylation sites are easily added or deleted during viral evolution and the diversity of glycan modifications, which depends on the loca-tion of the site in the protein and on the cell type, adds complexity to these structures (17) .",

Deletion of one of the two carbohydrate chains on VSV G protein still allows an interaction with calnexin, albeit inefficient (19) . The single glycan on SFV E1 protein is different: it allows an interaction with either calnexin or calreticulin (20) . Proteins that are more heavily glycosylated, such as influenza A virus HA (21) and HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (22) , associate with both chaperones. The lectins can bind simultaneously to one folding HA molecule, showing specificity for particular glycans (21) . Of the two glycans in the hepatitis B virus M protein, only one was shown to bind calnexin (23) .

Aside from the lectins, newly synthesized viral glycoproteins may bind BiP and other folding factors. The sequence and timing with which they associate and the particular chaperone that is used first, depend on the substrate molecule that is folding. Whereas HA binds to both lectin chaperones, and only associates with BiP if this firstchoice binding is prevented (25) , VSV G protein associates with calnexin but not calreticulin and requires transfer to BiP to complete folding (18) .

In the same cells, general protein maturation in the ER is not affected.

In addition, the conformation needs to be such that not only oligomeric interactions between polypeptide chains arise, but also that larger complexes can be formed.

Viruses evolve much more rapidly than their hosts do, and recombination events are frequent. As a consequence, protein modules from different viruses may combine into one multifunctional protein. This is a survival strategy of many RNA viruses, because of their small genome. One or two glycoproteins on the viral envelope then need to perform all the essential functions of the virus. A beautiful example is the influenza C virus spike protein HEF ( Figure 2 ). In each domain as well as in the complete proteins, the N-and C-termini are adjacent. The domains basically form loops, sometimes stabilized by a disulfide bond between the N-and C-terminus (31) . Examination of crystal structures of other viral glycoproteins, e.g. of retroviruses, raises the suggestion that this may be a more general phenomenon. The core of the soluble receptor-binding subunit gp120 of HIV envelope has adjacent N-and C-termini; the envelope protein of a mouse retrovirus was shown to tolerate large insertions and deletions in its hypervariable domain (32); the same was seen in a variant of a pseudorabies virus glycoprotein (33) .",

This is the receptor-binding domain, similar to R in influenza C, and the only domain consisting of one continuous polypeptide chain. The stem domain, comparable with fusion domain F in influenza C, folds next, after the folding of the top domain is complete (8, 34) .

This could imply that the N-terminal part of the protein needs to be kept unfolded during synthesis until its partner chain has been synthesized. Chaperone binding might be more important for this type of protein than for proteins with sequential domains formed from N-to C-terminus. Disulfide bond formation in the loop structures may involve transient non-native disulfide cross-links that need to be unscrambled by PDI and its family members. Up to now, however, there is no evidence for a different requirement for folding factors or for a difference in the number of non-native disulfide bridges during folding. This could be due to a shortage of available information, but it is more likely that there is no difference at all, because the folding process of virtually all proteins studied so far occurs mostly posttranslationally. When folding continues for minutes to hours after synthesis, it becomes irrelevant whether contacts in the native protein are local or distant in the polypeptide chain.",

A common theme is the immense irreversible conformational change fusion proteins undergo during the fusion process, sometimes even involving disulfide bond isomerization (53) . The fusion protein is synthesized as an inactive precursor protein. It folds in the ER into a stable conformation and oligomerizes; influenza virus and retrovirus spikes assemble into a homotrimer. At some point before or after incorporation of the protein into the virion, the fusion protein is activated by a proteolytic cleavage which results in a homotrimer of subunits consisting of a disulfide-linked (influenza A HA) or noncovalently associated (HIV Env) dimer.

Rare for cellular proteins, but quite common among viral glycoproteins, is the need for co-translational assembly to reach a proper structure. Relatively well-characterized examples are the envelope proteins from hepatitis C virus and the alphaviruses Sindbis and SFV. The alphaviruses present the genes encoding for the structural proteins on a 26S subgenomic mRNA (43) . This is translated as a precursor polyprotein in which the proteins are separated by co-translational cleavage events. The cytosolic capsid protein folds, cleaves itself off, and the following set of proteins is translocated into the ER lumen and forms the envelope spike [see (20) ]. Essentially, two structural proteins are synthesized next, in addition to one small 6K protein, which has not yet been very well characterized. The p62 and E1 protein of SFV are similar to the pE2 and E1 protein of Sindbis virus. E1 and p62 form a heterodimer. Cleavage of p62 into E2 and E3 in the TGN renders the spike protein fusogenic.

SFV p62 and E1, when expressed from separate mRNAs, display different behavior: p62 folds normally but E1 misfolds and accumulates in aggregates (45) . This implies that E1 needs to associate co-translationally with p62 for productive folding. For Sindbis E1 and pE2, the group of Brown (46 -48) carried out extensive folding studies. The E1 protein proceeds through three differentially disulfide-linked folding intermediates E1a, E1b and E1g before it reaches the native state E1o. Two other species are detected, but these seem to be unrelated to the correct folding pathway. Folding of E1 beyond E1b depends on dimerization with pE2 (46) . E1 associates transiently with BiP, until pE2 takes over. The assembly of E1 with pE2 and its release from BiP coincide with the acquisition of a conformation that is compact enough to be resistant to reduction by DTT, indicative of an important maturation step. pE2, on the other hand, is only found in a complex with BiP when it is misfolded (48) . Neither calnexin nor grp94 have been found to co-immunoprecipitate with the Sindbis glycoproteins. This may be a technical issue, because SFV p62 and E1 both associate with calnexin and calreticulin as well as the disulfide isomerases PDI and Erp57 (20) . Although p62 can fold quite well when expressed from a different mRNA than E1, its 'homologue' in Sindbis virus, pE2, does aggregate when a misfolded E1 is co-expressed (47) . This suggests that in both SFV and Sindbis virus the two envelope proteins associate before folding of p62 or pE2 is complete.",

The hepatitis C virus E2 protein folds rapidly: its folding is virtually complete at the moment of precursor cleavage and is hence independent of E1 (49) . The E1 protein, with which it dimerizes, folds slower; it needs the association with E2 to fold correctly. Both proteins associate transiently with calnexin until some time after dimerization (50), but calreticulin and BiP are found only in complex with misfolded dimers (51) .",

Preference for particular chaperones cannot easily be predicted. In most cases, the absence of a detectable association is likely to have a technical rather than a physiological reason. What makes viral envelope proteins special is the intricate network of functions and associations of which they are part of: the activation of precursor proteins into metastable structures, the changing interactions during 537 Traffic 2000: 1: 533-539 cell attachment and cell entry, the tight regulation of subunit synthesis, making proteins dependent on each other for folding. Moreover, in contrast to cellular proteins, a higher yield of folded viral protein may not always be favorable for the virus, because viral replication and virus production require a relatively healthy host cell for prolonged periods of time. It is clear that more studies on viral envelope glycoproteins are needed to determine whether folding in the ER can be a target for antiviral strategies.",
