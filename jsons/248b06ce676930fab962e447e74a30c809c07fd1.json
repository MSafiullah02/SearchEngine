Although the first epidemic of SARS is under control, its future reemergence is still possible. Therefore, effective strategies to control and treat this disease are urgently needed. Since SARS is an acute disease and the infection is naturally down-regulated during the early stages of the disease, host immunity against SARS-CoV appears to be effective. However, little is known about the immune control of SARS-CoV infection, especially the induced protective immune response in patients with SARS.",

Many CoVs are potent inducers of NAbs, which exhibit protective activities in vivo [10, 11] . The NAb against SARS-CoV has been analyzed recently, by use of a conventional neutralizing assay, in a small number of serum samples from patients with SARS [12] . Such a conventional assay requires culturing of wild-type virus, which is cumbersome and unsafe. In the present article, we describe an improved assay for analyzing NAbs to SARS-CoV based on a newly established SARS-CoV pseudovirus system. This assay measures the expression of luciferase as a result of pseudovirus infection and is, therefore, highly sensitive and reproducible. In addition, the assay is safe and can be performed in a highthroughput fashion. Using our neutralization assay, we analyzed serum samples obtained from 623 patients with SARS in the Beijing area, which was severely affected during the 2003 epidemic, with 125% of the total cases in the world. We found that a great majority (85.9%) of the serum samples from patients with SARS contained high titers of NAbs against SARS-CoV. We report here the characterization of the NAbs and the kinetics of generation of NAbs. Our results have important implications for the development of antibody therapy and vaccine for SARS.",

This result suggests that NAbs may play a role in the clearance of SARS-CoV during the early stages of the disease. A similar correlation has been observed in infections caused by other respiratory viruses. For example, Chargelegue et al. found that the NAbs to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were responsible for the reduction of the viral load in vivo [24] . Moreover, as reported in previous studies, the NAbs to RSV could be successfully used for treating high-risk infants with RSV infection [25] , suggesting that the NAbs to SARS-CoV may have therapeutic potency at an early stage of the disease. Another important characteristic of the NAbs to SARS-CoV is that they are maintained at a high level for at least 5 months (figure 3B), which may provide a protective mechanism and an explanation for the remarkably low rate of SARS-CoV reinfection [26] . On the other hand, we found that there was no clear correlation between the NAb titer and the course of disease (data not shown), suggesting that the NAbs to SARS-CoV did not confer protection against the development of symptoms. This apparent contradiction can be explained, however, by a recent suggestion made by Peiris et al. [20] that the lung damage that occurs during the later stages of SARS may be caused by an overexuberant host immunological response, rather than uncontrolled replication of SARS-CoV [13] .",

            "text": "In conclusion, our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV can elicit a strong humoral NAb response to the S protein, indicating that the S protein of this virus is highly immunogenic. In addition, our data show that NAb titers can be sustained for at least 150 days (figure 3B) and that the NAbs elicited by SARS-CoV S protein are not strain specific ( figure 4) . These findings provide strong support for the feasibility of developing a broadly reactive vaccine against SARS.",
