The explanation is intuitive: if symptoms appear before infectiousness, then contact tracing and isolation strategies will be effective, whereas for post-infectiousness symptom presentation, broader, non-symptom based strategies must be adopted. Consequently, identifying the relative timing as early as possible in an outbreak is imperative to assessing potential for control and selecting a measured response.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a prime example of a disease in which symptoms foreshadow significant levels of infectiousness (Anderson et al., 2004). This played a critical role in limiting mortality and morbidity in outbreaks during 2003, via simple public health measures such as isolation and quarantining (Ksiazek, Erdman, Goldsmith, Zaki, Peret, Emery, Tong, Urbani, Comer, Lim, et al., 2003, Lee, Hui, Wu, Chan, Cameron, Joynt, Ahuja, Yung, Leung, To, et al., 2003, Fraser, Riley, Anderson, Ferguson, 2004, Anderson, Fraser, Ghani, Donnelly, Riley, Ferguson, Leung, Lam, Hedley, 2004, Hsieh, King, Chen, Ho, Lee, Liu, Wu, et al., 2005, Day, Park, Madras, Gumel, Wu, 2006). Smallpox is most similar to SARS in this respect, but must be contrasted with HIV, where a large proportion of secondary infections occur before symptoms (Fraser et al., 2004). For influenza, the relationship is less clear, with symptoms and infectiousness likely coinciding closely, with some transmission possible before symptom onset (Patrozou, Mermel, 2009, Lau, Cowling, Fang, Chan, Lau, et al., 2010). For established diseases, experimental evidence (Charleston et al., 2011) or large-scale detailed case information (International Ebola Response Team et al., 2016) can provide insight into the relative timing of symptom onset and infectiousness; however, this relationship will not be known in an outbreak of an emerging pathogen. Therefore, one must turn to early outbreak surveillance data for insights.",

As an example, First Few Hundred studies are proposed as a first response surveillance scheme following the identification of a novel disease and/or strain as part of national pandemic plans (McLean, Pebody, Campbell, Champerland, et al., 2010, van Gageldonk-Lafeber, van der Sande, Meijer, Friesema, Donker, Reimerink, et al., 2012, AHMPPI, 2014). Following the observation of a first symptomatic individual, their household is enrolled in an intensive surveillance program, so that day of symptom onset for subsequent cases within that household are recorded. Studies of this form were developed for pandemic influenza in 2009 in both the United Kingdom (McLean et al., 2010) and the Netherlands (van Gageldonk-Lafeber et al., 2012); and have been instituted in response to a lack of methods for determining disease epidemiology as required for determining a proportionate response to novel outbreaks. In the Australian Health Management Plan for Pandemic Influenza (AHMPPI), First Few Hundred studies are proposed to be implemented following the first case of a novel influenza strain, with households being tracked nationally (but managed at the state/territory level) (AHMPPI, 2014). Methods have recently been developed to characterise transmissibility and severity of a novel pathogen \u2013 other factors influencing ability to control an outbreak (Fraser et al., 2004) \u2013 based on such data (Black, Geard, Caw, Vernon, Ross, 2017, Walker, Ross, Black, 2017). Currently lacking is a method for accurate determination of relative timing of infectiousness and symptom onset using this data.",

Two compartments for exposed and infectious individuals allows for a broad range outbreak observation dynamics, and allows Erlang-distributed exposed and infectious periods. Under this model, the timing of symptom onset relative to infectiousness is mapped to which transition is observed: symptoms appear either upon infection, between infection and infectiousness, coincident with infectiousness, between infectiousness and recovery, or upon recovery. The challenge is to determine which of these five (observation) models best describes the household-stratified symptom-onset data (Fig. 1\na).",

We assume that the population is large and mixing between households is random, such that after a household is initially infected, the remaining transmission within the household is independent of transmission outside the household (Ross, House, Keeling, 2010, Black, House, Keeling, Ross, 2013). Therefore, transmission dynamics within households can be modelled independently (Black et al., 2017), i.e., with infection only occurring between individuals within a household, rather than between households. Note that this is an assumption which simplifies the simulation process, but it could be modified if necessary. Given this novel etiological agent, we wish to determine if symptom onset occurs at the time of infection, between infection and infectiousness, coincident with infectiousness, after infectiousness, or coincident with recovery (i.e., these are the five candidate models we wish to discriminate). The model behaviours are otherwise assumed identical. To be emphatic, the underlying disease dynamics is identical in all five models, each differing only in when observations are made, corresponding to different timings of symptom onset (Fig. 1a). We focus on selecting between these observation models as the relative timing of infectiousness and symptom onset is critical to effective outbreak management: quarantine can be applied effectively if symptoms occur before (or possibly coincident to) infectiousness.",

Out-of-bag error is an error metric commonly used with random forests, that is calculated using the training data, rather than a separate test set. It relies on the structure of the random forest: in a random forest, only a (randomly sampled) proportion of training data (i.e., simulations) are used to construct each tree, so the remaining training data may be used to test the accuracy of that tree. Aggregating the result across all trees gives the out-of-bag error. In some cases out-of-bag error is prone to bias, so to ensure we are correctly assessing accuracy we instead use a left-out test set. We report accuracy as the proportion of all test samples that are correctly assigned to their generating model. I.e., we test 10,000 left-out training simulations from each model, and count those assigned the correct label. We also count the number that were assigned correctly to pre-infectious or coincident with infectious symptoms, versus symptom onset after infectiousness has begun: we call this the two-class accuracy.

Days 7\u201314 typically had little impact on model discrimination accuracy (i.e., optimal accuracy and two-class accuracy consistently levelled off as design size increased beyond 5; Fig. 1c/d), and the optimal combination of these days varied due to stochasticity in both training and test data. This is consistent with the feature importance used to develop the heuristic (Fig. 1b), i.e., those days that were consistently optimal were those with highest feature importance. When the most important design point is visualised (Fig. 2c) it shows a subtle but clear difference between distributions of observations from the different models; this provides intuition as to how decision trees constructed from many predictors of this form can accurately discriminate models.",

Combining the raw household data to form summary statistics is critical to this: if the raw household data is used rather than the summary statistics, accuracy is substantially lower. While it can be difficult to interpret the classifications made by a random forest-classifier, interrogating key individual predictors (as in Fig. 2c) provides clarity, and elucidates why feature importance provides a useful heuristic for choosing optimal designs (Molnar, 2019).",

Most critically, this model discrimination process assumes that the dynamics of the simulated epidemic model and observation models reflect the actual disease and observation dynamics. It is possible to use this method to select between models that differ in dynamics in addition to the observation process; however any increase in the number of models to classify will likely result in increased computation and potentially decreased accuracy. We have chosen to focus on the timing of symptom onset and infectiousness in one general disease process as an example, resembling influenza in both transmission dynamics and prior distributions on parameters. Useful future work could be to perform similar experiments on diverse disease processes, with different life histories. It would also be valuable to assess the robustness of the method for discriminating timing of symptom onset versus infectiousness when the underlying disease transmission model is misspecified. We note that selection between different transmission models (rather than observation models) for disease outbreaks has been considered in other studies, for example, assessing models of transmissibility over time for Norovirus from household data (Zelner et al., 2013).",

Independence between households is also assumed (i.e., that once a household is infected, all subsequent infection events are due to transmission within that household); this is only potentially valid in the case of a large population of households and the early stages of an outbreak. Household size is uniform across households within the simulation; if household size were allowed to vary, data from each household size would need to be evaluated separately, and more households may need to be observed to obtain suitable accuracy.
