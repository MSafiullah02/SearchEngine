Most baculovirus species have been isolated from Lepidoptera and the majority of nonlepidopteran isolates have not been well characterized. They are DNA viruses with closed, circular, double\u2010stranded DNA genomes ranging from 80 to 180 kbp in size. The genomes are packaged in bacillus\u2010shaped nucleocapsids, and the name \u201cbaculovirus\u201d is in reference to the nucleocapsid shape. Presently, the genomes from 29 baculovirus species have been sequenced providing a database of more than 4000 genes (Hiscock and Upton, 2000).",

This is reference to the occlusion of orally infectious baculoviruses in protein crystals called occlusion bodies (OBs). It is important to study the structure and function of ODVs and OBs because it expands the horizon for the application of baculovirus as insecticides. The ODV is also specialized to exploit the insect midgut which is one of the most extreme biological environments where the viruses are subject to caustic pH and digestive proteases. Understanding the molecular biology of the ODV should reveal new frontiers in protein chemistry. Finally, ODVs establish infection in insect gut tissues that are virtually nonsupportive to virus replication and which are continuously sloughed away. ODVs carry with them a battery of proteins that enable them to rapidly exploit and harness these unstable cells for virus replication. Learning about these proteins will have implications in biocontrol and biotechnology.",

            "text": "Fossil records tell us that terrestrial organisms originated from the sea and one of the earliest groups to venture out on to land was the arthropods, the predecessors of today's insects. Insects have been evolving and diversifying for the past 400 million years (Labanderia and Sepkoski, 1993) and so must have their viruses. Insect viruses of today may be related to the viruses brought onto land by ancient arthropod ancestors. The Baculoviridae is a family of insect viruses with complexity in form and function would suggest a long evolutionary lineage. Baculoviruses are genetically and morphologically distinct from other virus families and have an unusually stringent specificity for arthropod hosts. It has been suggested that baculovirus coevolved with Lepidoptera (Zanotto et al., 1993) given that most baculoviruses are isolated from this order and that there is high species specificity among lepidopteran baculovirus isolates. Baculoviruses isolated from other orders such as Diptera and Hymenoptera are also comparably less complex than the lepidopteran baculoviruses (Afonso 2001, Garcia\u2010Maruniak 2004, Herniou 2003, Lauzon 2004). The Lepidoptera were one of the last insect orders to experience significant species divergence, which occurred in the later half of the Cenozoic age (65 million years ago) (Labanderia and Sepkoski, 1993). If baculoviruses are as old as Lepidoptera, their survival as a virus family today can be attributed to the evolution of the ability of baculoviruses to occlude virions in protein crystals called OBs.",

            "text": "The baculovirus OB is a distinctive structure in virology. The OBs of baculoviruses are large enough to be observed by light microscopy and range from 500 to 2000 nm in diameter (Adams 1991, Bilimoria 1991, Boucias 1998) depending on the virus. This feature led to baculoviruses being the earliest described virus particles. Occlusion is an adaptation to permit baculoviruses to remain in a dormant but viable state in the environment for decades and perhaps even centuries (Bergold, 1963b). Baculovirus virions have lipid bilayer envelopes which normally make viruses susceptible to desiccation and loss of viability outside the host (Cox, 1989). The survival strategy of many enveloped viruses is to persist in living hosts as latent viruses or to infect a reservoir host species. For example, herpesviruses remain latent for decades in human hosts (Efstathiou and Preston, 2005) and the SARS Coronavirus was shown to persist in bats and civets (Li et al., 2005a). Insect viruses cannot rely on latency or reservoir strategies for several reasons. Insects are short lived compared to other animal classes thus limiting the chances for transmission of latent viruses between insect hosts. The dramatic physiological changes that occur in insects as they go from egg to adult also create complications at a cellular level that are not conducive to virus persistence. Probably the most important factor is that insect populations are seasonal and cyclic. There are long periods of time when insect species simply are not around in significant densities to transmit viruses. Insect viruses must persist for long periods in the environment waiting for population surges of their hosts.",

In essence, they have acquired the hardier characteristics of nonenveloped viruses without significantly altering the biology of virion entry and attachment to host cells. Occluded viruses do not infect any species outside of invertebrates suggesting that persistence in the environment is critical for insect viruses. The occlusion strategy has evolved in parallel with some other insect viruses such as entomopoxviruses (Poxviridae) and cytoplasmic polyhedroviruses (Reoviridae) (Adams 1991, Rohrmann 1986). However, baculoviruses have evolved occlusion to several orders of complexity above that of other occluded viruses. First, baculovirus OBs may contain multiple numbers of virions and second, the virions may contain multiple nucleocapsids. A single OB of some baculoviruses species may deliver dozens of virions to a tissue and infect a cell with multiple copies of the viral genome. In the next few sections, we will discuss the advantages of this strategy in baculovirus biology.",

Transmission occurs by the oral or \u201cper os\u201d route when insects inadvertently consume OB\u2010contaminated food. OBs and food particles travel through the foregut and enter the midgut (Fig. 1\n). Lepidopterans have alkaline midguts (pH 10\u201311) (Terra and Ferreira, 1994) and baculoviruses have evolved to tolerate and exploit this extreme microenvironment. The alkalinity of the insect midgut triggers the dissolution of OBs and the release of occluded virions into the midgut lumen. These released virus particles are, therefore, precisely defined as ODVs. Occluded ODVs are released from OBs within 12 min post entry into the insect midgut (Adams and McClintock, 1991) and once released into the midgut, ODVs must breach the peritrophic membrane (PM).",

            "text": "The PM is a net or lattice of chitin and protein that is produced along the length of the midgut such that it forms a hollow tube protecting the delicate midgut epithelium from direct contact with food particles. The PM is the insect equivalent of mucous, providing lubrication for food particle passage. The PM lattice has pore sizes ranging from 21 to 36 nm in diameter (Barbehenn and Martin, 1995). Small particles, such as digestive enzymes, can pass freely through the lattice into the endoperitrophic lumen to liberate peptides, sugars, and nutrients. The PM provides an immune defense by restricting the passage of larger particles such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses. To gain access to midgut tissues, ODVs must breach the PM through chance encounter of lesions or by releasing the PM\u2010compromising viral protease called enhancins (Greenspan 1991, Hashimoto 1991, Hotchkin 1981, Lepore 1996, Ohba 1983, Wang 1997b, Wang 1994). Enhancins are co\u2010occluded with ODVs in the OB matrix (Greenspan 1991, Hashimoto 1991, Hotchkin 1981, Lepore 1996, Ohba 1983, Wang 1994) or are present on ODV surfaces (Slavicek and Popham, 2005). Enhancins are metalloproteases, which cleave mucin\u2010like proteins bridging chitin strands in the PM lattice (Wang 1997a, Wang 1997b). Even baculoviruses that do not encode an enhancin degrade the PM by other viral factors (Derksen and Granados, 1988). Enhancins are an example of specialized adaptation of baculoviruses to their insect hosts. The study of baculovirus enhancins is of great importance not only for viral biology but also for the fact that these proteins expose vulnerabilities in the insect immune system.",

            "text": "Early on in the study of the Baculoviridae family, it was recognized that, based on OB morphology, there were two major divisions or genera; the nucleopolyhedroviruses (NPVs) and the granuloviruses (GVs). The OB morphologies are illustrated in Fig. 2\n. The virions of both of these baculovirus groups were occluded in proteinaceous OBs that could be seen under compound light microscope. The OBs of NPVs are most easily seen due to their larger size and their light refractory polyhedral (multisided crystal) structure. The average diameter of NPVs is within the range of 800\u20132000 nm (Bilimoria, 1991). The OBs of GVs appear as dark granules and are comparatively more difficult to resolve on the light microscope. They are ovoid shaped and about 500\u2010nm long and 200\u2010nm wide (Boucias and Pendland, 1998). The OBs of NPVs are called polyhedra and the OBs of GVs are called granula. Following this nomenclature, the major protein component of polyhedra is polyhedrin and the major protein component granula is granulin. Polyhedrins and granulins are \u223c30 kDa in molecular weight. Both polyhedrin and granulin form a crystalline lattice that occludes virions. Dozens of virions are occluded in a polyhedron, while only a single virion is occluded in a granulum (Fig. 2). Although crystals are the natural state of polyhedrin and granulin, the atomic structures of neither of these proteins have been determined. The major reason for this is that polyhedra and granules form only inside the nuclei of insect cells. Abundant amounts of both of these proteins can be easily acquired but they have not been successfully solubilized and recrystallized into forms suitable for NMR or X\u2010ray crystallography. X\u2010ray diffraction has been done on OBs themselves (Bergold 1963a, Harrap 1972a) and these data along with electron microscopy (EM) studies suggest polyhedrin proteins contact each other at six points as nodular spheres. Despite the uniformity of the polyhedrin crystal, ODVs are randomly oriented within OBs. In addition, the interface between the ODV virion lipid bilayer envelope and the polyhedrin matrix contains a fibrous network of which the composition is unknown (Adams and McClintock, 1991). It has been suggested that virion envelopes themselves catalyze polyhedrin polymerization (Wood, 1980). The biology behind the occlusion of ODV virions in polyhedrin or granulin is not well understood but there are likely unique interactions among virion envelope proteins and the protein matrix of the OB.",

The PE is porous and does not resemble a conventional lipid bilayer virus envelope (Adams 1991, Harrap 1972b, Robertson 1974). The PE is a protein/carbohydrate matrix that forms a lattice or net with hexagonal pores ranging from 6 to 15 nm in diameter (Adams 1991, Harrap 1972b). The primary PE carbohydrate sugars are hexoses (60%), pentoses (29%), uronic acids, and hexosamines (Minion et al., 1979). The primary PE protein is a phosphoprotein called polyhedral envelope protein (PEP) or PP34. PEP is covalently linked to carbohydrates by disulfide bonds (Gombart 1989, Whitt 1988). Early PE structures form in the nucleus as concentric rings (Adams 1977, Goldberg 2002). The PEs surround OBs during their formation and they are the last structure that physically separates the OB from its environment and, therefore, serves to protect the integrity of OBs during and after their release to the environment. The OBs of many baculoviruses are released in a bath of a viral protease. One of the more interesting modes of baculovirus transmission is through predators that consume virus\u2010infected prey (Abbas and Boucias, 1984). The OBs survive predator digestive proteases and glycosidases such that viable OBs are dispersed in predator's feces. Presumably, the PE helps the OB to resist digestion from viral and nonhost enzymes. The PE is an elegantly designed structure for ensuring the protection and integrity of OBs until they are consumed by an insect host. The PE lattice is fine enough to restrict access of large enzymes to the OB matrix but would permit rapid permeation by anions from the alkaline host midgut. This would presumably lead to rapid decrystallization of polyhedrin or granulin, rupturing of the PE, and the release of ODV into the midgut. The complete release of ODVs from OB proteins may be further enhanced by OB\u2010associated alkaline proteases that have been reported to be present in OBs from larvae (Eppstein 1975, Eppstein 1975, Langridge 1981, Maeda 1983).",

Goblet cells are involved in potassium ion transport from the hemolymph into the midgut and are not infected by baculoviruses (Adams and McClintock, 1991). ODVs primarily infect the predominant columnar cells, which are involved in secreting digestive enzymes and absorbing nutrients. On the luminal side, columnar cell surfaces are covered in brush border microvilli. ODVs have the specificity to bind to the apical ends of microvilli (Adams and McClintock, 1991). ODVs have lipid bilayer envelopes that fuse directly with midgut cell membranes (Haas\u2010Stapleton 2004, Horton 1993) resulting in the release of nucleocapsids into the cytosol (Fig. 3\n). These nucleocapsids migrate to the nucleus where they are unpackaged and the viral DNA genome is released. Virus genes are expressed, products of structural genes are synthesized, DNA replication ensues, and new progeny viruses are assembled and released. In the primitive hymenopteran baculoviruses, new progeny virions are occluded and released after cell lysis back into the midgut lumen (Ackermann 1983, Garcia\u2010Maruniak 2004, Lauzon 2004, Podgwaite 1984).",

Midgut cells are sloughed off regularly (Engelhard and Volkman, 1995) and are prone to apoptosis (Uwo et al., 2002) and, it becomes a race against time for the baculoviruses to establish infection in these cells. In addition, midgut cells are in a cell cycle arrest that is not conducive for virus DNA replication. Tissues beyond the midgut columnar epithelium have actively dividing cells that are more suitable for virus replication. However, the ODV is narrowly specialized to infect midgut epithelial cells in an extreme alkaline environment and has been rarely observed to infect other cell types. Because insect viruses rely on chance encounter infection, maximal progenies are needed to ensure survival. It is a significant advantage for baculoviruses to infect tissues beyond the midgut as many more viral progeny can be produced in a given host. This advantage has driven baculoviruses to evolve a second, radically different, budded virus (BV) phenotype (Fig. 4\n). BVs are broadly specialized to infect many internal tissues of the host including tracheoblasts, hemocytes, and fat body. BV entry occurs by receptor\u2010mediated, absorptive endocytosis (Volkman and Goldsmith, 1985), and acid\u2010triggered fusion of BV envelopes with endosomal membranes (Blissard 1992, Leikina 1992). The existence of two virion phenotypes in one virus is a major distinction of the Baculoviridae family. In later sections, we will describe these virion phenotypes in more detail.",

Penetration of the basal lamina by BV is not well understood. Often EM images of this process show a clearing zone around BV as they traverse the basal lamina. The basal lamina is composed of protein, and it is possible that proteases produced by columnar epithelial cells are being directed by the virus to be released at the basal lamina. In addition, a viral\u2010encoded cathepsin (V\u2010CATH) has been copurified with BV (Lanier and Volkman, 1998). In cancer metastasis, malignant tumor cells become invasive to tissues by producing cathepsins on their surfaces that degrade the extracellular matrix (Nomura 2005, Yamaguchi 1990). V\u2010CATH may have an analogous function enabling BV to be projected through the protein matrix of the basal lamina.",

As a defense mechanism against viruses, the infected midgut cell is sloughed off and new cells are generated to aid in gut recovery.

The tracheal system is the respiratory system of insects which begins on the outside as openings called spiracles along the lateral sides of insects. Tracheal tubes branch extensively as they lead from spiracles into the hemocoel. These branches transition abruptly into a network of very small tubes called tracheoles. Tracheoles are lined by tracheolar cells which can be 200\u2013400 nm in length (Wigglesworth, 1984). Tracheoles impregnate nearly every tissue including the midgut epithelium. A midgut cell\u2010derived BV infecting a tracheolar cell can bypass the basal lamina and its BV progeny will have access deep into the tissues of the hemocoel. To a lesser degree, midgut regenerative cells that lie basolateral to the midgut epithelium also have been shown to be sites of midgut cell\u2010derived BV virus infection (Flipsen et al., 1995). Once in the hemocoel, BV is further dispersed by infecting hemocytes. These cells circulate throughout the open circulatory system. Hemocytes are mostly involved in immune response and infection of these cells has the added effect of reducing the ability of the host to combat the virus infection.",

However, this virus is trapped inside the host, which is not necessarily a problem given that predators will often target slow moving, sick larvae and disperse OBs after feeding (Abbas and Boucias, 1984). Cannibalism among some insect species may also contribute to horizontal transmission. These modes of transmission are not efficient and most baculoviruses release OBs from the host by virus\u2010induced tissue liquefaction and the cuticle rupture after death. These processes are facilitated by the synergistic interaction of the viral protease, V\u2010CATH (Ohkawa 1994, Slack 1995), and the viral chitinase, ChiA (Hawtin et al., 1997). As the liquefied remains ooze out from the dead host, OBs are broadly dispersed along food surfaces that are eaten by a new host.",

            "text": "With the exception of some cell types, the baculovirus replication cycle includes a nonlytic phase of BV production, followed by ODV production and ending with the lytic release of OBs. These phases have been illustrated in Fig. 6\n. The baculovirus infection cycle stages occur at predictable time intervals. The length of those time intervals is virus species specific and many baculoviruses require longer replication times than the model AcMNPV virus. The baculovirus replication cycle begins almost immediately after the nucleocapsid delivers the viral genome into host cell nucleus. Viral immediate early genes are expressed within 30 minutes postinfection (Chisholm and Henner, 1988) and their protein products along with virion\u2010associated proteins begin to manipulate the host cell to become competent for DNA replication. The structure of the nucleus is modified resulting in its expansion or nuclear hypertrophy. For AcMNPV, this process can be observed in the first 6 h. An electron dense, irregular\u2010shaped, granular region begins to form in the center of the nucleus (Harrap 1972a, Young 1993). This region is called the virogenic stroma and it is the site of viral RNA transcription, DNA replication, and nucleocapsid assembly. Concomitant with the appearance of the virogenic stroma is the movement of cellular heterochromatin to the edges of the nucleus along the inner nuclear membrane (INM) (Williams and Faulkner, 1997). Heterochromatin is highly condensed, histone\u2010associated host genomic DNA. The rearrangement of the nucleus has been shown to be mediated by viral interaction with tubulin (Volkman and Zaal, 1990). The virus infection causes the nucleus to partition itself into two major regions, the virogenic stroma and the peristromal space or nuclear ring zone. The heterochromatin on the outer edges of the nuclear ring zone gradually disappears over time (Williams and Faulkner, 1997). As the virogenic stroma expands, cavities or lacunae form inside it and nucleocapsids are assembled along the edges inside these cavities (Young et al., 1993). The stroma is composed mostly of RNA with DNA and a protein scaffolding that supports RNA and DNA complexes (Young et al., 1993). At about 12 hours postinfection (hpi), the virogenic stroma expands to fill most of the nucleus. Between 12 and 20 hpi, the BV virion phenotype is produced. The earliest made nucleocapsids in the baculovirus infection migrate out of the virogenic stroma, across the ring zone and to the nuclear membrane. Nucleocapsids are transported through the nuclear membrane and migrate across the cytosol to the cell membrane where they bud out. The process involved in translocation of nucleocapsids is not well understood although there is growing evidence of cellular actin involvement (Beniya 1998, Braunagel 2001, Lanier 1998, Lanier 1996, Lu 2004, Lu 2002). In the process of budding, nucleocapsid are enveloped in the host membrane and acquire virus\u2010encoded proteins in their envelopes. In midgut columnar epithelial cells, BV nucleocapsids show basal polarity (Keddie et al., 1989).",

A computer illustrated structure of BV is presented in Fig. 4. The BV envelope contains the major viral glycoproteins, GP64/GP67 (Whitford et al., 1989), and fusion protein or F protein (Lung 2002, Pearson 2000, Pearson 2001, Westenberg 2002, Westenberg 2004, WF 2000). These proteins have also been called ENV proteins as they mediate budding, attachment, and entry of BVs (Blissard 1992, Hefferon 1999, Oomens 1999). In transmission EM preparations, BV envelopes are bulbous at one end and the surface is serrated (Adams et al., 1977). The serrations or notches are called peplomers and are thought to contain GP64 and F protein given that antibodies specific for BV envelope proteins localize in the peplomer region (Volkman et al., 1984). BV envelope proteins are N\u2010glycosylated and are sorted in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in order to be transported to the cell membrane. The GP64 protein is only present among group I NPVs and the F protein of these viruses has apparently lost its ENV functions (Whitford et al., 1989). The group II NPVs and GVs all encode for F proteins (Bulach 1999, Hashimoto 2000, Hayakawa 1999, Herniou 2001, Lange 2003, Luque 2001, Slack 2004, Wormleaton 2003, Zanotto 1993). F protein differs from GP64 in that it requires proteolytic cleavage before it can be functional (Westenberg et al., 2002). The only baculoviruses that do not have F protein homologues are the hymenopteran baculoviruses NeleNPV (Lauzon et al., 2004) and NeseNPV (Garcia\u2010Maruniak et al., 2004). These baculoviruses likely do not to produce BVs.",

The virogenic stroma becomes more condensed and the nuclear ring zone expands to accommodate accumulating nucleocapsids. Nucleocapsids in the nuclear ring zone become ODVs as they acquire lipid bilayer envelopes. The retention and formation of enveloped virions in the nucleus is a unique biological phenomenon. The ODV envelope is a lipid bilayer that resembles, but is not identical to, the INM in composition (Braunagel and Summers, 1994). The ODV envelope is more rigid than the BV envelope due to the presence of more saturated fatty acid phospholipids. The ODV envelope also contains phosphatidylcholine instead of phosphatidylserine which is found in BV envelopes.",

The time of ODV morphogenesis coincides with the appearance of membranous structures which are believed to be the precursors of ODV envelopes (Adams 1991, Fraser 1986, Hong 1994). Considerable evidence has been generated to favor an INM source which invaginates as microvesicles into the ring zone late in infection (Braunagel 1996a, Hong 1994). It should be pointed out that even by this mechanism, the virus would have to induce \u201cde novo\u201d INM synthesis to ensure enough material for nucleocapsid envelopment. The ODV envelope contains a number of integral and associated viral proteins. These proteins are more diverse than BV envelope proteins. They are mostly nonglycosylated and they are transported to the ODV envelope by unique mechanisms. The ODV envelope proteins will be described more in detail in later sections of this chapter. Unlike BV nucleocapsids, ODV nucleocapsids are also packaged in a proteinaceous virus derived tegument prior to envelopment. After occlusion, this tegument becomes more condensed around nucleocapsids (Knudsen and Harrap, 1976).",

The OBs of V\u2010CATH deletion mutant AcMNPV viruses are not released from infected cells in cell culture. V\u2010CATH has been linked with appearance of free OBs in the hemolymph of BmNPV\u2010infected insects (Suzuki et al., 1997).

The virions of SNPV contain single nucleocapsids and the virions of MNPV contain multiple nucleocapsids. MNPV virions can contain more than 40 nucleocapsids (Kawamoto and Asayama, 1975). The MNPVs have, however, only been observed in lepidopteran baculovirus isolates (Rohrmann, 1986). It could be that there are not enough examples of nonlepidopteran baculoviruses. While it has been somehow debatable whether to retain the \u201cS\u201d and \u201cM\u201d designations in baculovirus nomenclature, single and multiple capsid subphenotypes have been suggested to be anomalous and with no genetic basis or biological importance (Herniou et al., 2003). The more compelling argument for the distinction of SNPV and MNPV are biological studies that demonstrate the advantage of the MNPV over the SNPV in oral infectivity (Washburn 1999, Washburn 2003b). These studies are difficult to do as the genes for multiple and single occlusion are not yet known and comparisons must be made between related but not identical MNPV and SNPV baculoviruses.",

            "text": "One of the earliest proposed theories for multiple occlusions was that it was a way for baculoviruses to bypass replication in the midgut and to deliver virions to the hemocoel via the tracheoles or other cell types (Keddie et al., 1989). This has been termed the \u201cpassage effect\u201d (Granados and Lawler, 1981) (Fig. 5). It was demonstrated that when MNPV ODVs infect midgut cells, some nucleocapsids bypass the nucleus, migrate to the basal lamina side (basement membrane) of the midgut cell, and bud through to infect other cell types (Adams 1977, Granados 1981). This can occur because other nucleocapsids from the MNPV ODV virion enter the nucleus, uncoat, and express early genes including the BV envelope fusion protein gene, gp64. The gp64 gene has a bipartite early and late promoter and the GP64 protein is produced by 6 hpi by AcMNPV (Blissard and Rohrmann, 1989). The GP64 protein accumulates on the basement membrane of midgut cells (Keddie et al., 1989) and enables ODV\u2010derived nucleocapsids to bud as infectious BV. This theory has been supported by the demonstration that the elimination of the gp64 early promoter reduces the oral infectivity of AcMNPV (Washburn et al., 2003a). F proteins such as Ld130 of LdMNPV are produced at late times postinfection (Pearson et al., 2001). However, the promoter structures of the f protein genes of LdMNPV and Spodoptera exigua multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (SeMNPV) contain early and late virus transcriptional motifs (IJkel 1999, Kuzio 1999).",

This is intriguing given that the AcMNPV F protein present in ODV envelopes (Braunagel et al., 2003). The presence of F protein in the ODV and its enhancement of oral infectivity points to F protein being an important ODV protein. ODVs enter midgut cells by direct fusion of the virion envelope with the midgut cell membrane (Horton and Burand, 1993) and the simplest explanation is that F protein is involved in the fusion of ODV envelopes with the midgut cell membrane. Presumably the F protein is C\u2010terminally anchored in the ODV envelope with its N\u2010terminus exposed.",

After fusion of the ODV with the midgut cell membrane, there would be opportunity for F protein transfer into midgut cell membranes. F protein could be absorbed by pinocytosis and subsequently translocated along side nucleocapsids to the basement membrane. This would be a rapid mechanism for ODV virions to pass through the midgut cell cytoplasm and to form BV at the basement membrane. GVs such as EpapGV appear only to infect midgut cells but completely evade midgut replication and infect fat body, epidermis, and tracheolar tissues (Goldberg et al., 2002). GVs have a single nucleocapsid in each OB and the early ENV protein expression strategy would not work. F protein membrane transfer and translocation may offer these viruses a mechanism of passage through the midgut. The F proteins of group II NPVs and GVs have not yet been identified in the ODV. It has been noted that the nonfunctional AcMNPV F protein homologue has low identity to the functional F protein homologues of group II NPVs and GVs (Lung et al., 2002). However, F protein homologues of group I NPVs, group II NPVs, and GVs have common structural features (Lung 2002, Lung 2003) and thus would be expected to be also localized in the ODV envelope.",

The size of the viral genome determines the length of the nucleocapsid. Nucleocapsids are polar, with a claw or base on one end and a nipple or apical cap on the other end (Federici 1986, Fraser 1986). The apical cap is oriented toward the virogenic stroma during nucleocapsid assembly (Fraser, 1986). It is also found associated with the forming envelopes of the ODV and is oriented on the peplomer end of BV (Adams 1991, Fraser 1986). The nucleocapsid is composed of an outer protein capsid surrounding a nucleoprotein core (Arif, 1986). The most abundant structural protein of the nucleocapsid is VP39 (Blissard 1989, Guarino 1990, Pearson 1988, Thiem 1989b) with monomers arranged in stacked rings around the nucleoprotein core (Federici, 1986).",

EM studies later revealed that PP78/83 is associated with the nucleocapsid base (Russell 1997, Vialard 1993). Discovery that PP78/83 nucleates actin polymerization has lead to the suggestion that this protein is involved in nucleocapsid translocation into the nucleus after infection (Lanier and Volkman, 1998). Only 19 PP78/83 homologues are found among 29 baculovirus genomes. PP78/83 appears to play a critical and a multifunctional role (Kitts and Possee, 1993). The study of a number of baculovirus proteins often reveals multifunctional roles. The name PP78/83 is in reference to the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated state of this protein (Vialard and Richardson, 1993). PP78/83 has also been shown to be a component of the virus\u2010encoded RNA polymerase complex (Iorio et al., 1998). It is difficult to find a linkage between transcription and virion translocation; however, PP78/83 would be translocated to the nucleus to participate in the transcriptome.",

BV/ODV\u2010C42 has a conserved nuclear localization signal and localizes along with PP78/83 in the DNA\u2010rich virogenic stroma. BV/ODV\u2010C42 has not been specifically localized to the capsid base. However, we consider this likely given its association with PP78/83. BV/ODV\u2010C42 interacts directly with another highly conserved capsid\u2010associated viral protein called ODV\u2010EC27 (Braunagel et al., 2001). ODV\u2010EC27, which is also associated with the ODV envelope, is involved in regulating the cell cycle and will be covered in detail in following sections. It is possible that BV/ODV\u2010C42, ODV\u2010EC27, and PP68/83 are found associated together as complex at the nucleocapsid base.",

The vp80 gene is transcribed late in infection and the protein localizes in the nucleocapsids of BV and ODV (Li 1997, Muller 1990). The VP80 homologue of CfMNPV has 72 and 82 kDa molecular weight protein forms (Li et al., 1997) and only the 82\u2010kDa protein is associated with ODV nucleocapsids. The 82\u2010kDa form is the result of posttranslational modification given that this protein has a predicted mass of 71.2 kDa. N\u2010Glycosylation was eliminated as a possibility (Li et al., 1997) and phosphorylation is an alternative explanation given that this protein has 52 potential phosphorylation sites.

The predominant protein in the nucleoprotein core is a small peptide with a pI value of 12 that is aptly named, Basic Protein. It is has been suggested that the positively charged arginine residues of Basic Protein interact with the negatively charged DNA backbone to enable its condensation in the nucleocapsid (Kelly et al., 1983). Basic Protein is protamine\u2010like (Tweeten et al., 1980) and has been called P6.9 or VP12 depending on the baculovirus (Wilson 1988, Wilson 1987). Basic Protein is also a phosphoprotein and its phosphorylation is inhibited by the presence of Zn2+ (Funk 1992, Funk 1993, Wilson 1985). When nucleocapsids are unpackaged in a new cell, cellular chelators remove Zn2+ which promotes Basic Protein to be phosphorylated by capsid\u2010associated kinases (Funk 1993, Miller 1983, Wilson 1985). The resulting change in charge dissociates Basic Protein from viral DNA which then unpackages from the nucleoprotein core (Funk 1993, Wilson 1985). This unpackaging may occur at nuclear pores or in the nucleus. Ultimately, the viral genome is delivered into the nucleus where it is bound up by host histones (Wilson and Miller, 1986).",

VP1054 is an essential 42\u2010kDa baculovirus protein that is required for capsid assembly and the arrangement of VP39 monomers (Olszewski and Miller, 1997a). Temperature sensitive (Ts) mutants of the VP1054 protein produce spherical capsids in the virogenic stroma instead of tubular capsids (Olszewski and Miller, 1997a). Association of this protein with nucleocapsids (Braunagel et al., 2003) may suggest interaction with VP39 during the formation or stacking of VP39 oligomer rings. In one model of nucleocapsid assembly, the capsid base and main body are preassembled in specific locations in the virogenic stroma (Fraser, 1986). The nucleoprotein passes through the apical cap and is supercoiled as it is packaged into empty capsid tubes. The supercoiling of viral DNA into the capsid has not been characterized. The nucleocapsid\u2010associated protein, desmoplakin (AcMNPV ORF66), has some homology to type I topoisomerases and could be involved in mediating the supercoiling of DNA. There are 55 homologues of baculovirus desmoplakins shared among 29 baculovirus genomes. Type I topoisomerases are found associated with the nucleocapsids of Vaccinia virus and it has been shown that these proteins accelerate the expression of early viral genes (Da Fonseca and Moss, 2003).",

VLF\u20101 is essential for virus replication (Li 2005b, Vanarsdall 2004, Yang 1998a) and it is associated with BV and ODV nucleocapsids (Yang and Miller, 1998b). The VLF\u20101 protein binds to cruciform DNA structures and may have a role in processing of the viral genome during nucleocapsid assembly (Mikhailov and Rohrmann, 2002b). On the basis of the DNA\u2010binding activities, VLF\u20101 and AN would be expected to be associated with the viral genome in the nucleoprotein core region. The persistence of VLF\u20101 and AN with ODV nucleocapsids may point to additional functions for these proteins.

One of the reasons for this is that columnar epithelial cells are in an arrested state. Many of the host DNA replication factors are not present in arrested cells and this is a challenge for replication of a large genome DNA virus. The nucleocapsids of ODVs have consequentially evolved to carry with them viral DNA replication factors along with the viral genome. The six core baculovirus DNA replication proteins are immediate early 1 (IE\u20101), DNA polymerase (DNApol), P143 (helicase), LEF\u20101 (primase), LEF\u20102 (primase cofactor), and LEF\u20103 (single\u2010stranded DNA\u2010binding protein or SSB) (Kool 1994, Lu 1995b). ODV nucleocapsids contain all of these proteins but for LEF\u20102 (Braunagel et al., 2003). The absence of LEF\u20102 is surprising given its oligomerization with LEF\u20101 (Evans 1997, Hefferon 2002) and its stabilization of LEF\u20101 binding to DNA (Mikhailov and Rohrmann, 2002a).

This leads to uncontrolled covalent bond breakages and functional inactivation. In one study examining the effects of time, temperature and light, the latter was the major factor influencing viability (Jarvis and Garcia, 1994). Ultraviolet (UV) light only represents 5% of sunlight energy but is the form of energy that most damages baculovirus viability (Shapiro et al., 2002). Baculovirus OBs persist in the environment for long periods of time and are frequently exposed to UV light. Exposure of OBs to UV light results in dramatic decrease of oral infectivity (Shapiro et al., 2002). Natural reservoirs of viable baculovirus OBs are most prevalent on plant stems and nonlight exposed surfaces (Raymond et al., 2005).",

It was hypothesized that UV induces synthesis of host enzymes that enable repair of UV\u2010damaged viral genomes. Some baculoviruses may have acquired the host DNA repair genes such as viral\u2010three prime repair exonuclease (V\u2010TREX) and photolyase. Homologues to the v\u2010trex gene have only been identified in AgMNPV (Slack 2004, Slack 2004), CfMNPV (Yang et al., 2004), and CfDEFNPV (Lauzon et al., 2005). The v\u2010trex gene may have been acquired from the host given its homology to insect genes (Slack et al., 2004). Although there is no direct evidence of virion localization, V\u2010TREX overproduction leads to significantly increased levels of associated 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 exonuclease activity in BV (Slack and Shapiro, 2004). The astounding success of AgMNPV as viral insecticide may be partially attributed to the resistance of this virus to UV damage in the field. Another example of a candidate baculovirus DNA repair enzyme is a photolyase that has been identified in the genomes of TnSNPV (Willis et al., 2005) and ChchNPV (van Oers et al., 2005). The baculovirus photolyase and V\u2010TREX proteins point to a selective pressure for baculoviruses to acquire DNA repair enzyme genes.",

In bacterial systems, they function as part of a complex with ABC\u2010type UvrA ATPases and UvrB helicases (Lin 1992, Lin 1992).

Failure of this strategy may have been due to poor engineering of the protein to be a component of the ODV nucleocapsid. This kind of approach attempting to engineer baculovirus tolerance to UV light will likely become more important in the future.

Cdc2 forms complexes with cyclin B to trigger cells to enter mitosis and divide (Nurse, 1990). In other words, cyclin B/Cdc2 complexes induce the G2/M phase transition. At late times in baculovirus infection, cyclin B is rapidly degraded and cells enter G2/M phase transition arrest (Braunagel et al., 1998). This loss of cyclin B coincides with formation of ODV\u2010EC27/Cdc2 complexes (Belyavskyi et al., 1998). ODV\u2010EC27 lacks a cyclin\u2010like destruction box motif thus providing mechanism to maintain ODV\u2010EC27/Cdc2 complexes and G2/M phase arrest. It has been suggested that maintaining G2/M phase arrest at late times in infection is very important from the prospective of the ODV assembly (Belyavskyi et al., 1998). During M phase, the nuclear envelope breaks down to permit chromosomal segregation and cell division. Arresting the cells before the onset of M phase may be required for ODV assembly given that they acquire their envelopes from the INM, which would be lost if cells were permitted to proceed through M phase. The inner nuclear envelope may also have physical characteristics at the end of the G2 phase which may make it more easily acquired to form ODV envelopes. It should be noted however, that the nuclear membrane completely disintegrates prior to the assembly of GV ODVs (Goldberg et al., 2002).",

ODV\u2010EC27 also coimmunoprecipitates with cyclin\u2010dependent kinase 6 (Cdk6) (Belyavskyi et al., 1998). Cdk6 normally binds to cyclin D to promote cells to proceed from quiescent G0 and G1 phases to the DNA synthesis S phase (for review see Ewen, 2000). DNA viruses require cells to enter the S phase in order that nucleotides and other cellular resources are made available for virus DNA replication. Emphasis on S phase transition early in baculovirus infection is supported by studies of the baculovirus immediate early gene, IE\u20102, which independently causes cells to enter S phase arrest (Prikhod'ko et al., 1999a). Curiously, IE\u20102 has not been detected in the ODV.",

P53 is a DNA\u2010binding protein and it is possible that P33 associates with host P53 proteins on the viral genome in nucleocapsids.

Only IAP2, IE\u20102, and PE38 had ubiquitin ligase activities and such activities were inconclusive for CG30 (Imai et al., 2003). CG30 is the only protein among these that have been localized to ODVs.",

It was shown that PNK/PNL has three functionally active domains with kinase, phosphatase, and RNA ligase activities, respectively (Martins and Shuman, 2004).

The ie0 gene is the only known early baculovirus gene to be spliced (Kovacs 1991, Pearson 1997, Theilmann 2001) and it plays an essential role establishing baculovirus infection (Pearson 1997, Stewart 2005). The ie0 gene results from the splicing of a small exon onto the 5\u2032 end of the ie\u20101 gene (Chisholm and Henner, 1988). Expression of ie0 occurs very rapidly in the first few hours of infection and then diminishes while ie\u20101 expression continues late into the virus replication cycle (Kovacs et al., 1991). At the beginning of infection, there is likely an immediate need for robust RNA\u2010splicing activities to ensure translation of IE0. The capsid\u2010associated PNK/PNL protein may be present to augment these cellular splicing activities. This may be necessary in some cell types that the virus infects. The ratios of IE0 and IE\u20101 also affect baculovirus host specificity (Lu 1996, Pearson 1997, Stewart 2005) and thus PNK/PNL may be playing a role in specificity through RNA splicing.",

Oddly, the deletion mutant of CG30 was slightly more orally infectious and produced more BV (Passarelli and Miller, 1994). Given its immediate cost on the virus, cg30 must be an auxiliary gene with long\u2010term evolutionary benefits such as host range. Homologues to the cg30 gene are present only in NPVs and in all cases, the cg30 gene is downstream and in the same orientation as the major capsid protein encoding gene vp39. The cg30 gene is transcribed from an early promoter and late vp39 transcripts are bicistronic such that they include the cg30 ORF in addition to the vp39 ORF (Blissard 1989, Lu 1996, Thiem 1989a). There is no direct evidence that CG30 is translated from this late transcript; however, only 2 bp separate the end of the vp39 ORF from the beginning of the cg30 ORF and from what is known of baculovirus bicistronic translation (Chang and Blissard, 1997), CG30 is likely synthesized in lesser amounts but at the same time as VP39.

In these techniques, ODVs are treated with detergents such as Nonidet P\u201040 (NP\u201040) and the soluble proteins are defined as envelope proteins and the remaining insoluble proteins are assumed to be nucleocapsid proteins. Tegument proteins are solublized by NP\u201040 due to loss of viral envelopes retaining them within the virions. Discriminating ODV integral envelope proteins from tegument proteins can be done using phase separation and the detergent Triton X\u2010114 (TX\u2010114) (Bordier, 1981). The tegument protein GP41 is released from ODVs by NP\u201040 detergent (Pan 2005, Whitford 1992), and some have suggested GP41 is an integral ODV envelope protein (Pan et al., 2005). However, GP41 partitions entirely into the aqueous phase in TX\u2010114 detergent separation experiments (Whitford and Faulkner, 1992). Hidden Markov analysis (Krogh et al., 2001) of all GP41 homologues found no predicted transmembrane domains.",

The significance of this to the function of GP41 is unknown. The only functional studies of GP41 suggest this ODV structural protein affects BV production. A Ts mutant of GP41 blocked nucleocapsid exit from the nucleus at Ts conditions (33\u00b0C) and prevented formation of BV (Olszewski and Miller, 1997b). It was suggested that presence of GP41 in the ODV tegument was \u201cadventitious\u201d and was the result of the proteins presence in the nucleoplasm. This may be a premature interpretation of the role of GP41. This protein is conserved among all baculovirus genomes sequenced so far. The hymenopteran NeseNPV and NeleNPV baculoviruses contain gp41 gene homologues (Garcia\u2010Maruniak 2004, Lauzon 2004) and these viruses appear to produce only ODV. Earlier observations could have been the result of a Ts mutant GP41 inappropriately interacting with nucleocapsids exiting the nucleus. ODVs are not occluded in wt AcMNPV at 33\u00b0C (Lee and Miller, 1979) and thus the role of GP41 in the ODV could not be examined for GP41 Ts mutants.",

            "text": "Data has been published addressing the orientation of ODV\u2010E66 and ODV\u2010E25 in the ODV envelope. In a study where the transmembrane region of ODV\u2010E66 was fused to the N\u2010terminus of GFP, the resulting protein chimera was exposed on microvesicle surfaces (Braunagel et al., 2004). This data was extrapolated to suggest that ODV\u2010E66 is exposed on the cytoplasmic side of the ER and the nucleoplasmic side of the INM. Several indirect lines of evidence point to ODV\u2010E66 and ODV\u2010E25 being oriented on the inner side of the ODV envelope. First, ODV\u2010E25 is not completely released from ODV by NP\u201040 detergent and remains residually associated with the nucleocapsid (Russell and Rohrmann, 1997). Second, yeast two\u2010hybrid and immunoprecipitation show that ODV\u2010E66 binds to the major capsid protein VP39 (Braunagel et al., 1999). From this we would suggest that ODV\u2010E66 and ODV\u2010E25 are involved in ODV capsid envelopment. A caveat to our prediction of ODV\u2010E66 orientation is that the ODV\u2010E66 of AcMNPV may be cleaved by trypsins in ODV preparations. This would indicate surface exposure of ODV\u2010E66. When this 66\u2010kDa protein was purified from OBs, a smaller 60\u2010kDa molecular weight form appeared (Hong et al., 1994). N\u2010terminal sequencing suggested that this was a tryptic digest product of ODV\u2010E66 (Hong et al., 1994). The trypsin cleavage site is not conserved among ODV\u2010E66 homologues and the authors of this study did not speculate on the origin of the trypsin activity present in ODV preparations.",

FP25K associates with BV and ODV nucleocapsids (Braunagel et al., 1999) and BV/ODV\u2010E26 associates with BV and ODV envelopes (Beniya et al., 1998). BV/ODV\u2010E26 has been localized on the plasma membrane, BV envelopes, INM microvesicles, and ODV envelopes (Beniya et al., 1998). BV/ODV\u2010E26 lacks transmembrane domain motifs and is released from ODVs by NP\u201040 detergent treatment (Beniya et al., 1998). Like the tegument protein GP41 (Whitford and Faulkner, 1992), BV/ODV\u2010E26 fractionates into the aqueous phase of TX\u2010114 detergent phase partition assays (Beniya et al., 1998). BV/ODV\u2010E26 is thus a peripheral membrane protein and interaction with FP25K would orient BV/ODV\u2010E26 to inner side of the ODV envelope. A small proportion of BV/ODV\u2010E26 protein remains with purified BV and ODV nucleocapsids (Beniya et al., 1998). Presumably this is due to association with FP25K.",

The lack of polyhedra in FP25K mutants was first correlated with the inappropriate localization of polyhedrin (Jarvis et al., 1992) and decreased polyhedrin gene transcription (Harrison et al., 1996). FP25K mutants failed to translocate ODV\u2010E66 to INM vesicles (Rosas\u2010Acosta et al., 2001) and ODV\u2010E66 peptide became significantly less abundant while the mRNA transcripts of odv\u2010e66 were unchanged (Braunagel 1999, Rosas\u2010Acosta 2001).

BV budding is driven by GP64 accumulation on the cell membrane (Oomens and Blissard, 1999).

Covalent cross\u2010linking experiments revealed that FP25K and also BV/ODV\u2010E26 bind to the transmembrane region sorting motifs of ODV\u2010E66 and ODV\u2010E25 (Braunagel 2004, Saksena 2004).

The mechanism by which FP25K and BV/ODV\u2010E26 traffic proteins may involve actin or cystoskeleton filaments. FP25K has been identified to contain three myosin\u2010like regions and one actin\u2010binding motif (Beniya 1998, Braunagel 1999). BV/ODV\u2010E26 also has a tropomysosin motif. The nucleocapsids of FP25K deletion mutants were not efficiently enveloped (Katsuma et al., 1999). Given the role FP25K plays in ODV\u2010E66 translocation, this indirectly supports the premise that ODV\u2010E66 is involved in ODV capsid envelopment.",

P74 was the first ODV envelope protein to be demonstrated essential for oral infection (Kuzio 1989, Yao 2004, Zhou 2005). Perhaps P74 should be renamed PIF\u20100 or P74\u2010PIF\u20100 as it was the first PIF to be discovered. The P74 protein is C\u2010terminally anchored in the ODV envelope (Slack et al., 2001) and is N\u2010terminally exposed on the ODV surface (Faulkner et al., 1997). P74 has an internal transmembrane domain and a C\u2010terminal double transmembrane domain. The internal transmembrane domain has characteristics of an internal transmembrane insertion signal peptide with positively charged amino acids on one side and negatively charged amino acids on other side (Alberts et al., 1994). Experimental data suggest that the central transmembrane motif is not inserted into membranes and remains buried in the protein. A chimeric P74\u2010GFP protein lacking only the P74 C\u2010terminal double transmembrane domain is soluble and not associated with membranes (Slack et al., 2001). The double transmembrane domain motif on the C\u2010terminus of P74 is odd because of the closeness of these domains and suggests a \u201chairpin\u201d or folded transmembrane domain that may spontaneously insert into membranes. It was demonstrated that bacterially expressed and purified P74 proteins could spontaneously insert into ODVs and rescue oral infectivity of a P74 null virus (Yao et al., 2004). This work also indicates that P74 does not require post secondary modification to be functional.",

Among all P74 homologues including the \u201cpseudobaculovirus\u201d Hz\u20101, there is one conserved trypsin cleavage site corresponding to R156 in AcMNPV. The position of this site correlates with the size of the P74 cleavage product produced after incubation in the midgut trypsins. The P74 is the most complex of the ODV envelope proteins.

The lepidopteran midgut is rich in trypsin and chymotrypsin (Johnston 1991, Terra 1994) and it is likely that baculoviruses have evolved to tolerate and exploit these proteases just as they have for midgut alkalinity. Our work suggests that supplementation of baculoviruses with trypsin enhances oral infectivity and addition of soybean trypsin inhibitors decreases oral infectivity. Tryptic cleavage activation is documented for other viruses including Coronavirus (Frana et al., 1985), Rotavirus (Vonderfecht et al., 1988), Sendai virus (Muramatsu and Homma, 1980), and Vaccinia virus (Ichihashi and Oie, 1982).

These nonoccluded ancestors may have required alkaline proteolytic activation to infect midgut tissues. Midgut alkalinity is the primary trigger for the release of ODVs from OBs. Why might baculoviruses retain the need for trypsin activation? One possible reason is that viral attachment protein receptor\u2010binding domains may need to be shielded from the OB matrix proteins. Another possibility is that hydrophobic membrane fusion elements must be exposed during ODV assembly. When N\u2010terminally truncated forms of the ODV envelope protein P74 are synthesized in insect cells, the protein becomes trapped nonspecifically in regions of the cell (Slack et al., 2001).",

The OB\u2010associated proteases are of host origin and are not present in tissue culture derived OBs (McCarthy and Dicapua, 1979).

These \u201cancestral\u201d baculoviruses do not appear to have the BV phenotype and their replication is restricted to the midgut.

A per os bioassay functional genomic approach has been used to identify PIF proteins that are essential for oral infection (Kikhno 2002, Pijlman 2003). The first PIFs to be identified this way were PIF\u20101 (originally PIF) and PIF\u20102 (Kikhno 2002, Pijlman 2003). PIF\u20101 was characterized as the ORF7 gene product of the Spodoptera littoralis nucleopolyhedrovirus (SpliNPV) (Kikhno et al., 2002). PIF\u20102 was characterized as the ORF35 gene product of the SeMNPV (Pijlman et al., 2003). The pif\u20101 and pif\u20102 gene homologues are ORF119 and ORF22 of AcMNPV, respectively. The 60\u2010kDa PIF\u20101 protein and the 44\u2010kDa PIF\u20102 protein contain prominent N\u2010terminal transmembrane motifs that is likely to serve as transmembrane anchors. When we analyzed all homologues of these two proteins for transmembrane motifs (Krogh et al., 2001), we identified only a single N\u2010terminal transmembrane motif for both of these proteins. These hydrophobic N\u2010terminal transmembrane motifs are similar to the INM sorting motifs present on ODV\u2010E66 and ODV\u2010E25 (Braunagel 2004, Hong 1997).",

There are presently no data published to show that SeMNPV PIF\u20102 is a component of the ODV; however, the AcMNPV homologue was detected in ODVs (Braunagel et al., 2003).

PIF\u20101 is produced in low abundance in SpliNPV (Gutierrez et al., 2004) and may not be easily detected in AcMNPV ODV preparations. PIF\u20101 and PIF\u20102 have been shown to be involved in ODV binding to midgut cells (Ohkawa et al., 2005).

            "text": "Another group of proteins that play an enhancing role in oral infection are the 11K proteins (Lapointe 2004, Zhang 2005). Like the PIFs, these proteins are conserved among many baculovirus genomes and in addition, homologues are found in entomopoxviruses (Dall et al., 2001). The 11K protein homologues of AcMNPV are encoded by ORFs Ac145 and Ac150 (Lapointe et al., 2004). Their distinguishing feature is not so much amino acid sequence identity but the presence of C6 chitin\u2010binding motifs or peritrophin\u2010C domains that are common among mucins, peritrophins, and chitinases (Tellam et al., 1999). This pointed to the possibility that 11K proteins interact with and compromise the PM similar to enhancins (Lapointe et al., 2004). The experimental evidence suggests that the 11K protein enhancement of oral infection does not involve the PM (Zhang et al., 2005). In some circumstances, the Ac145 protein acts synergistically with the Ac150 protein (Lapointe et al., 2004) while in other cases Ac150 alone acts as an enhancer of oral infection (Zhang et al., 2005). Ac150 contains a prominent N\u2010terminal transmembrane domain and it is associated with BV and OBs (Lapointe et al., 2004). Immuno\u2010EM data showed that Ac150 could be an ODV envelope protein (Lapointe et al., 2004) and possibly a PIF\u20104 given that it has been classified as a PIF (Zhang et al., 2005). However, the oral infectivity enhancement effects of Ac150 only occur with OBs and not with alkali liberated ODVs (Zhang et al., 2005). Perhaps Ac150 is exposed on the ODV surface and is involved in the timely release of ODVs from the OB protein matrix.",

However, a model for how INM vesicles form the ODV envelope after entry into the nuclear ring zone has not been presented. We suggest that this process may be similar to the process that occurs with BV formation (Fig. 9\n). The lumen of the ER is continuous with the lumen between the ONM and INM. For BV formation, ER secretory vesicles containing GP64 and F protein are translocated (through the Golgi complex) to the cell membrane where they fuse. In these ER\u2010originating vesicles, GP64 and F protein are oriented toward the lumen to result in their orientation on the outside of the cell membrane. BV nucleocapsids then bud out acquiring these proteins as BV envelope proteins. For ODV formation, INM vesicles containing ODV envelope proteins are released into the nucleus. ODV nucleocapsids attach to these INM vesicles just as BV nucleocapsids attach to the cell membrane. It has been suggested that ODV\u2010E66 is exposed on the surfaces of INM vesicles (Pijlman et al., 2003). We propose that ODV\u2010E66 interacts directly with the nucleocapsids as they bind to INM vesicles. The ODV nucleocapsids essentially bud into INM microvesicles and are enveloped. Membrane proteins oriented on the luminal side of INM vesicles are consequently exposed on the surfaces of ODVs. Thus, F protein and P74 would be expected to be present on the luminal side INM vesicles prior to their becoming ODV envelope proteins. This is presently only a hypothesis and much work is still needed to understand the morphogenesis of the ODV.",

Experiments involving BV function can be done in cell culture while ODV studies are best when they include feeding bioassays with insects. For most laboratories, rearing insects is messy and the quality of animals can vary from even the best equipped facilities. Consequently, many ODV studies have been lacking due to the omission of an animal model. The media environment of cell culture is well defined while the animal model and particularly the midgut are infinitely more complex and have an extreme microenvironment for which the biology is still not fully understood. Finally, the ODV is a far more complex structure than the BV. Multiple capsids per virion, occlusion, more diverse viral protein composition, and the tegument all contribute to the complexity of ODV virions. The ODV\u2010associated proteins with functions involving viral DNA packaging, capsid translocation, cell cycle disruption, DNA replication, and DNA repair have been the easiest proteins to study given that their activities can be evaluated in insect cell culture.",

            "text": "Fig 9: A simple model for baculovirus virion envelopment and envelope protein translocation. The BV and ODV forms in distinctly different locations in the cell. BV nucleocapsid must translocate through nuclear pores out of the nucleus, across the cytosol, and to the cell membrane. ODV nucleocapsids are retained within the nuclear ring zone. The formation of enveloped virions in the nucleus is unusual for viruses. However, there may be a common thread between the ODV and the BV morphogenesis. Cell surface proteins such as BV integral envelope fusion proteins (EFPs) are synthesized in the ER such that they are exposed in the ER lumen. EFPs are translocated to the cell surface in ER vesicles, which after sorting in the Golgi complex, fuse with the host cell membrane. This permits EFPs to be presented on the outside of BVs as they bud out of the cell. ODV virions may acquire their envelopes by \u201cbudding\u201d into INM vesicles. The double nuclear membrane is continuous with the ER. In this model, ODV envelope proteins such as P74 and F protein would be displayed on the luminal side of the ER and nuclear double membrane. Envelope proteins such as E66 that may interact with nucleocapsids would be displayed on the nucleoplasmic side of INM vesicles.",
