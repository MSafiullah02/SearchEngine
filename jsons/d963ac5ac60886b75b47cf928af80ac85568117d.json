And this perception will evolve over time depending on the progression and the phases of the pandemic. There are others who are not persuaded by this notion of excess-risk and anticipate, with good reason, a massive influx of surgical cases in a few weeks. Based on this analysis, these colleagues believe that it is therefore necessary to continue to operate on patients with cancer if that is possible.",

Finally, if you no longer have access to the operating room, you, the surgeon, and not the medical doctor, should assume the responsibility for instituting medical treatment of this appendicitis; such medical management is exposed to you in this issue (13). But hold out! Keep an operating room available for emergencies, despite the formal demands of the ARS whose injunctions have incredible force in view of the number of dead and despite the temptation to open yet J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f another bed to our anesthetist-resuscitators swept along by the avalanche of cases and facing increasingly difficult",

Some feel that the global intra-operative risk is increased and poorly controlled during a pandemic period and therefore surgery for a patient with an asymptomatic limited colon cancer should be deferred. While the patient must undergo curative surgery, this excess risk does not seem acceptable. This is partly explained in the article by Tuech et al. published here (3). The intra-operative risk linked to Covid-19, was initially reported in a single Chinese publication on four cases, not a very significant sample. But a second publication describing 30 cases is much more worrisome, with a 44% rate",
