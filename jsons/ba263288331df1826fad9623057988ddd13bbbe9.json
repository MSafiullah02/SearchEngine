The presentation is intended for doctoral students and other 'new' researchers considering research with socially oppressed groups (e.g., homeless people) within social and environmental contexts often not covered in classic and contemporary research methods texts. Through a discussion of my experience as a novice researcher, the presentation will highlight ethical and social dilemmas encountered during the planning and data collection phases of the research. I will focus on practical tips and suggestions for dealing with the trials and tribulations in getting the study started, and how unforeseen issues, such as the SARS outbreak, affected data collection. Furthermore, I will also highlight the need and importance of incorporating strategies for self-care and safety while in the field, and how these planned strategies are critical to the process of knowledge building. Last, I will discuss the implications for conducting applied research with socially oppressed populations and the struggles inherent in maintaining a balance between the academic and the lived reality of doing research.",

            "text": "Mulder M As poverty continues to ravage the American urban landscape and population, homeless shelters function as integral components to care for those who find themselves outside the mainstream economy. Many authors have previously contended that these shelters have tended to operate as quasi-asylums. They asserted that the very nature of the homeless shelter in general left its clients deeply institutionalized because of the regimentation and controlling environment. After a four-month-long participant observation of a homeless shelter in a Midwestern city, I found these assertions to indeed be true. Moreover, since the shelter I examined operated under a clearly evangelical Christian rubric, the questions became ever more intriguing in this era of \"faith-based initiatives.\" This particular institution complicated matters with a pervasive evangelical rhetoric and with an intensely rigorous year-long program that sought to nurture responsibility and independence among chosen clients. In the end, the \"mission\" created for itself a subset of \"hyper-institutionalized\" homeless men. These men lived at the shelter, professed to believe its principles, and functioned within a much codified environment. Although they lived as members of a program that proposed to prepare them for independent living, I found that these hyperinstitutionalized men ultimately became a cheap workforce for the shelter and left after the year inadequately prepared for the radical adjustment to life outside the mission. Homeless shelters have long operated as the last resort for marginalized in urban America. The services they provide are integral to the health and well-being of the estimated 700,000 homeless every night. However, given the current administration's impetus to provide funding to the faith-based segment of these institutions, it becomes imperative to study religious homeless shelters-both for the methods employed and the outcomes.",

Housing costs are a significant component of the household budgets of most urban households and typically represent their single largest asset. In addition, urban households are influential upon the differential distribution of wealth and control in society, and play a significant role in shaping social identities, and conferring social status. It follows that the social and economic dimensions of urban housing would be a plausible part of the pathway between socioeconomic status and health status. This paper will present a conceptual framework which models the links between material, meaningful, and spatial dimensions of housing, on the one hand, and health status on the other, within a life-course perspective. Empirical examples will contextualize the conceptual and theoretical arguments.",

How substance abuse and trauma are defined and assessed in the international research literature remains quite controversial. This presentation will discuss innovative prevention, practice, and teaching in this global problem. While an overwhelming majority of older adults (age 55 and older) see physicians and other professionals often, the literature reports that those at risk for substance abuse (alcohol, prescription misuse, and other drugs) are unlikely to be identified despite frequency of contact. Additionally, symptoms of substance abuse problems exhibited by older adults are often dismissed by clinicians and family members as signs of \"old age.\" Challenges in identifying the \"hidden alcohol abuser\" are important for those working with or caring for older people. According the literature, there is debate as to which screening instruments accurately detect alcohol and drug abuse in the elderly. The prevailing issue is questioning how clinicians have refined screening protocols in older adults for alcohol and prescription medication problems, quantity and frequency of use, and responses to negative emotional states and isolation. Our poster will recommend research, education, training, and clinical interventions for international social work educators who provide a wide range of services for the older adult at risk for substance abuse problems. Future education efforts would include infusing trauma, substance abuse, and older adult content into the social work curriculum, and examining instruments used with this population.",

Using random-digit dialing to contact a representative sample of adults living in New York City, we assessed the prevalence of symptoms of alcohol and smoking dependence after September 11, 2001. In the four months after September 11, 1.6% of the 2001 respondents reported symptoms consistent with alcohol dependence and 10.4% reported symptoms of smoking dependence. Respondents with symptoms of alcohol dependence were more likely to have probable PTSD and depression than respondents without symptoms of alcohol dependence (15.1% vs. 7.1% for PTSD; 42.2% vs. 7.5% for depression).

Harm reduction is a well-established and valuable framework in treating individuals who experience the negative consequences of substance use. Despite the fact that harm reduction came into prominence as a public health approach and a clinical approach largely in response to the AIDS epidemic, in general, harm reduction is standing on its own in syringe exchanges and some community-based programs. This paper identifies harm reduction interventions and strategies that can be integrated within HIV primary care, and offers recommendations for how they can be integrated.",

The methodological approach advocated in this paper draws heavily on critical reflective practices within the field of education and the practice of mental health clinicians as well as the interdisciplinary harm reduction work of McCoy, Heller, and Cunningham. Implications: Implementing HIV harm reduction practice impacts the organization of service delivery, practitioners and patients. The role of the health care provider is more collaborative and less authoritative, and the role of the patient is more participatory and less dependent than in traditional models. The implications for quality and effectiveness of care under the proposed approach need to be further mapped and evaluated. Objectives: To determine factors that may influence clients to drop out of treatment. Methods: Clients were invited to complete a survey regarding their current and past experience. Demographic data, type of substance abuse, route of referral, therapy, and social supports were documented.",

Few studies have assessed the role discrimination may play in shaping the health of highly marginalized groups, such as minority drug users. We assessed the relation between discrimination due to drug use and mental and physical health of minority substance users in New York City. We recruited 1,008 adults (\u226518 years), who were currently (last 2 months) using cocaine, crack, or heroin. Participants were asked about their experiences of discrimination due to a variety of characteristics (e.g., drug use, race, gender), and about their current state of health. The majority of participants were male (63.9%) and single (62.3%); 41.7% were Latino, 49.7% were African-American, with a mean age of 40.4 (SD = 8.2). Discrimination due to drug use, poverty, and race were the most frequently reported forms of discrimination experienced (75.3%; 32.7%; 31.1% respectively), and were associated with lower mental health status (P < .0001; P < 0.001; P = 0.04 respectively), and higher number of self-reported diagnoses (P = .007; P = 0.009; P = 0.0002 respectively) in separate multivariable models adjusted for age, income, education, gender, race, social support, social networks, and drug use history. These observations suggest that discrimination experienced by illicit drug users is negatively associated with self-reported health, even when adjusting for drug use behaviors. Policies that reduce discrimination due to drug use behavior, poverty, and race may decrease the burden of illness experienced by this vulnerable group.",

They took responsibility for their decision to use drugs; but also held a common perception that social and physical environments limited their ability to manage their drug use and find alternative coping strategies.",

Several steps could be taken. Training of both lawyers and case managers in identifying HIV-related violence and pursuing appropriate questions is a critical first step. Equally important is the need to encourage the creation of a range of referral services. Furthermore, coordinated efforts between program areas would greatly benefit HIV+ clients as would interagency efforts addressing the relationship between HIV/AIDS and gender-based violence.

Unfortunately, not all APIA are as uniformly educated, acculturated, and financially stable, as the myth of the \"model minority\" would have us suggest. Although adults from many nationality groups between APIA have adapted well to life in the U.S, serious problems have emerged among our youth. In particular, gang violence in the APIA community has increased dramatically nationwide. In Los Angeles County California alone, there are currently 155 Asian gangs (membership over 6,000). In neighboring Orange County, gang involvement has reached an all time high with over 65 documented gangs (membership over 2,000). Even more disturbing is the increase of Asian females involved in gangs. In Orange County, where the Asian gang population makes up 12%, there are 140 Asian female gang members, up 60% from last year. The author interviewed 400 gang members out in the streets, jails, and juvenile halls, using a target questionnaire; concomitantly went a step further disguised as a gang member. This study identified several distinct differences between the ideology and the \"state of mind\" between Asian male/female gang members. Moreover, the author identified six contributing factors, which lead to involvement in gangs (i.e., lack of adult supervision, family breakdown, victimization due to racism, culture shock, need for survival, and monetary profit). The purpose of this study is to present timely data on APIA youth gangs; offer strategies for prevention/intervention to help control this rising problem.",

The differences, though less dependent on religious views, are largely due to differences in economic and cultural traditions. Secondary migration of immigrant and refugee communities into urban areas with resettlement into extended clan and family groups makes these communities somewhat 'hidden' populations. It is essential for these populations to be related to with a needs assessment based approach that focuses not only on community deficiencies, but also cultivates the resources and talents within the community. This pilot project was funded through the Minnesota Women's Foundation and written by Leadership, Development and Empowerment Group (LEAD). LEAD realizes that generating community system building efforts, both from within and from outside of the community and strengthening the existing community organizations are of paramount importance. Women are traditionally and have been the health care providers, as well as the brokers and protectors of their families. There are a large number of women who are first-time heads of their households, who cannot read or write, and do not know about navigation of the health care system. They are also in need of health care services and use them more frequently than men, particularly during their childbearing years. The goal of the study is to increase the access to health care services, particularly breast and pelvic cancer screening, develop relationships with targeted communities, and health care providers systems, and educate the providers about culturally competent health care for these communities. Metropolitan State University School of Nursing with support from the Metropolitan State University Community-Based Learning Center partnered with LEAD on all aspects of this project.",

Many said they waited until symptoms persisted for several weeks or until they were very ill before seeking care. Many women expressed that good health is a strong value that is embedded in the cultural and religious traditions of their ethnic communities. A few women expressed distrust of the American health care system because they believed that as refugees they were not given the best care or that they were subjected to experimental treatments or unnecessary surgery.

We evaluate the usefulness of three different residential indictors for identifying areas in Atlanta, San Francisco and Detroit where women are not receiving preventive cancer services. Using cancer registry data (SEER) matched to US Census data, we found that residence in a Census tract that met the federal government's definition of a medically underserved area (MUA) increased the probability of a late-stage diagnosis of breast cancer. Additionally, residence in an extremely poor tract (poverty rates 40% or more) or in an underclass tract (rates of high poverty and social distress) increased the probability of a late-stage diagnosis for both breast and cervical cancer. However, not all of these tracts have been designated as Medically Underserved Areas (MUAs). This study suggests there is a need to reform and broaden the criteria traditionally used by the federal government for designating MUAs. Existing federal programs need to be integrated so that geographic areas in need of cancer screening services can also become neighborhoods where follow-up care is available. How race/ ethnicity plays an independent role in determining diagnostic outcomes depended on the city of residence. More research is needed to examine differences in the availability and delivery of health care and possible discriminatory practices against minority women.",

Immigrants' uninsured status, lack of financial means, and their unfamiliarity with the US health system frequently discourage them from seeking mental treatments. However, immigrants' everyday difficult circumstances also make them wish for professional support that could help them cope with everyday stressors. These results could lead to the design of health interventions addressing immigrants' access barriers to metal health services, including the consideration of their own perception of symptoms and their unsatisfied demands.",

There is an increasing trend towards the feminization of migration in Asia's mega-cities. The increase in the participation of women in the regional labor migration (from 15% in 1976 to 27% by 1987) revealed an upward trend in the 1990s, and is evidenced by the feminization of migrant work in Asia. For instance, overseas Filipino workers increased from 61% in 1998 to 68% in 1999. The increasing number of women migrant workers engaged in the informal labor sector, both as domestic help and as sex workers, raises health issues. While the vulnerability of migrants to HIV and other infections is recognized, their lack of capacity to negotiate safe sex and their continuous denial of rights to make free choices regarding their bodies exacerbate their risk of contracting HIV. Access to health care is not considered a right of migrant workers in receiving countries. For undocumented migrant workers, their fear of arrest effectively restricts the use of medical facilities, especially that of state-run hospitals. Lack of poor access to health care by migrant workers precipitates their vulnerability to HIV. In essence, the right to health is the right to life, and of which no migrant worker or migrant family should be deprived. The UN convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families provides a comprehensive guideline to the treatment to which migrants are entitled as guest workers in a host country. The paper will attempt to look deeply at the current situation by using various international sources and information, and to provide a forum for discussion and recommendations.",

Being a victim of or even being a witness to violence is considered to be a major risk factor in developing mental health problems. On a larger scale, the prevalence of violence in cities saps human and social capital and results in tumbling real estate values and decreased quality of life. Interventions to prevent violence are generally developed from a single disciplinary perspective, e.g. psychological or sociological. Such a perspective is limited in tackling such a complex problem rooted in the many areas currently being explored by different fields. This paper will propose a multilevel, multidisciplinary model for researching the topic of violence. Examples of research methods and results of studies at each level will be summarized in order to produce a more integrated model to guide research regarding the phenomenon of violence. Information from biology, psychology, sociology, and other disciplines will be used to develop a true urban health approach. Contributions to the problem from hereditary factors, intrapersonal phenomena and interpersonal experiences will be discussed. Included will be areas of research related to families of origin, present family and organizational interactions. The role of community disorganization will also be outlined including the contribution of neighborhoods from both a citizenry and urban planning perspective. The overarching economic and cultural factors as they relate to understanding violence will also be discussed. Suggestions regarding the use of coalitions in researching, planning and evaluating violence interventions will be presented. Ways of involving the public and professionals in the prevention of violence will be discussed.",

We were interested in examining if changes in homicide rates are associated with urban neighborhood income and income inequality. We used homicide data from 1990-1996 from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of New York City (OCME). We calculated median income and the Gini coefficient for 59 city neighborhoods from the 1990 US Census. Homicide rates were stratified by fourths of income and income disparity and compared over time. Overall, the highest homicide rates were in the poorest neighborhoods and in neighborhoods characterized by the greatest income inequality. However, over the 7-year period, the greatest decreases in homicide rates occurred in the poorest neighborhoods and in those with the greatest income inequality. In neighborhoods with the greatest income disparity, homi-cide rates decreased from 76.98 to 29.21 deaths per 100,000, a 62% decrease. In neighborhoods with the least income disparity, there was a reduction from 17.2 to 9.2 deaths per 100,000, a 47% decrease. In 1996, homicide rates remained 5.7 times higher in the poorest neighborhoods than in the wealthiest neighborhoods and 3.2 times higher in neighborhoods with high inequality compared to neighborhoods with low inequality. These findings suggest that there was differential reduction in homicide in urban neighborhoods with different incomes and income distribution; variable enforcement efforts or sociodemographic changes may partly these observations. Additional research is needed to explore mechanistic relations between urban neighborhood context and homicide.",

The findings are based on qualitative analysis of two-hour long interviews with 36 battered women in New York City, who responded to fliers posted in all the police precincts, victim service offices, and emergency rooms in New York City hospitals. Some participants were recruited from special pendant alarm programs (coordinated community interventions). Respondents included women who fled, as well as women who were still living with their batterers. Their narratives revealed that those who \"stayed put\" and evicted their batterers were motivated and fortified by their longstanding socioenvironmental connections to their housing and neighborhoods. Posteviction, some women solicited the vigilance of doormen even in the neighboring buildings, some estranged neighbors became the much needed eyes at the back, some building managements levied and enforced entry bans against the batterers, while some women in special programs were not extended that same level of support from the police/district attorney. The presentation will address the transformation of site-of-abuse to home. It will also highlight the need for tailored neighborhoodlevel interventions directed at inculcating an intense, \"not in my backyard\" kind of intolerance and resistance to battering-the kind faced by local governance when proposals of waste disposal facilities and homeless shelters are presented to neighborhood boards and block associations.

This paper provides a systematic review of the issue of physician distribution in urban areas in the United States. We conducted a thorough search of the peer-reviewed and grey literature regarding the issue of intra-urban physician distribution. Although the evidence for physician distribution is limited, most published work suggests that physician maldistribution exists in urban areas and that the reasons for this maldistribution are complex. Physicians cluster close to academic training centers, preferentially practice in higher income areas, and tend to work in areas where persons of similar racial/ethnic backgrounds work and live. Many interventions have been implemented in order to address physician distribution in urban areas. Policy changes such as financial incentives for physicians locating to underserved urban areas, increase in inner-city medical school funding, and the use of foreign medical graduates have all generated mixed results. There are several methodological and logistical issues that make the study of physician distribution in urban areas challenging. The variations in the definition of \"urban\" in different national and international contexts make cross-study comparisons difficult. Determining the optimal number of physicians for particular urban areas is also difficult due to intra-urban differences in morbidity and the mobility of both physicians and urban residents. The projected increase in urban populations in the coming decades suggests that questions pertaining to access to equitable care for urban residents are timely and important. Additional research is needed to understand the factors and solutions related to physician maldistribution to improve the health of urban populations.",

Finally, strong community and social support is often lacking in many urban areas and this growing population can suffer from isolation, depression, high degrees of symptom burden, and caregiver burnout. The Mount Sinai Visiting Doctors program cares for 600 patients annually and delivers primary medical care to homebound persons in Manhattan through the use of physician and nurse practitioner home visits.

Lower frequency of unsafe injection practices and reduced risk of infections are associated with access to sterile injection equipment. Washington State amended drug paraphernalia laws in 2002, permitting pharmacy syringe sales and adult possession of sterile syringes. Methods: In March 2001, public health workers began recruiting retail pharmacists to expand syringe access to IDU. Four 24-hour-access syringe drop boxes were installed at high-use sites. Researchers conducted: (1) test-buys in 60 randomly selected retail pharmacies from 12/2002-01/2003; (2) street surveys of discarded syringes by walking five-block areas surrounding syringe drop-box sites before drop-box installation and quarterly thereafter; and (3) 227 phone surveys with Seattle area pharmacies to assess pharmacist attitudes and practices regarding syringe sales to IDU. Phone surveys and test-buys repeated a 1996 Seattle survey. Results: Seattle pharmacies selling syringes in test-buys increased from 46.9% (N = 64) in 1996 to 65.0% (N = 60) in 2003 (Fischer Exact = 0.03). Pharmacists agreeing that syringes should be available to IDU through pharmacy purchase increased from 48.9% (N = 137) in 1996 to 70.6% (N = 100) in 2003 (Fischer Exact < 0.001). By June 2003: 80 pharmacies agreed to participate in access/sales partnerships; four syringe drop boxes collected approximately 23500 syringes; no discarded syringes were found in street surveys.Implications: Policy changes and targeted pharmacy outreach efforts may increase pharmacy syringe access.

We examined the clinical and social factors associated with leaving AMA from a specialized HIV/AIDS ward, among patients who reported a history of injection drug use.Methods: All patients with a history of injection drug use admitted to the HIB/AIDS ward at St. Paul's Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia (the largest specialized HIV/AIDS hospital ward in Canada) between April 1997 and October 2000 were reviewed. A multivariate logistic regression model utilizing a generalized estimating equation algorithm identified factors associated with leaving hospital AMA.Results: Of the 1056 hospital admissions to the HIV/AIDS ward by patients with a history of injection drug use, 263 (24.9%) resulted in leaving hospital AMA. Independent positive predictors of leaving AMA included recent injection drug use (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.08; 95% CI 1.41-3.07) and Aboriginal ethnicity (AOR 1.55; 95% CI 1.05-2.28). Factors independently associated with reduced odds of hospital discharge AMA included methadone use in hospital (AOR 0.49; 95% CI 0.32-0.76), social support (AOR 0.33; 95% CI 0.21-0.51) and older age (per 10 year increment, AOR 0.56; 95% CI 0.43-0.73).",

Hence, this qualitative research study of Yoruba immigrants, an ethnic group from southwestern Nigeria living in the Philadelphia, PA-Wilmington, DE metropolitan areas, sheds some light on the question of how best to serve such immigrant populations. The study found that there are three types of Yoruba immigrant groups: (1) those who use only Western medicine (though mostly for pragmatic reasons), (2) those who combine traditional Yoruba and Western beliefs, and (3) those who combine Western medicine and Christian beliefs. 04296 Jordan's Legacy: Reaching Pregnant Youth in the Inner City Dzendoletas D, Copeland J, Gorman A, and Little M Background: Pregnant homeless women and their newborns are particularly susceptible to poor health outcomes.",

The purpose of this study is to review and characterize the cases of PTI presenting to an inner city Level-1 trauma center over a 10-year period. Trends in incidence, types of PTI, and associated demographic information were recorded.Methods: Patients with PTI who presented to our trauma center from January 01, 1992 until August 31, 2002 were identified using the trauma registry database. Charts for those identified were reviewed and the data collected. Data from the city police department was obtained to review the incidence and locations of inner city crimes involving PTIs. A clinical epidemiologist was consulted for statistical methods.Results: PTI comprised 8% of all traumas in 1992 compared to 13.8% in 2001. PTI increased overall by 5.7% from 1992 to 2001.Implications: There was a 6-fold increase in PTI from 1992 to 2002. Dynamics of inner city life contribute to this increase in violent behavior.

Coyote's natural prey includes rats, mice, birds, rabbits, house cats or domestic dogs. In urban settings without their natural predators e.g. bears, cougars or wolves; the coyote becomes a real threat to humans-especially children. In British Columbia, numbers of \"urban coyotes\" has increased, and young children are at risk from attack. Our purpose is to raise public awareness about the danger to children from wild coyotes living in urban settings.Results: In September 2000 an eighteen-month-old boy playing near a soccer field was attacked and bitten by a wild coyote. 7 stitches were required to close the wound above his eye. In December 2000 a coyote stalked and charged a 3-year-old boy near an elementary school. In July 2001, 6 yearold girl playing near a tennis court was attacked by a daughter from the animal's grip and she received treatment for her puncture wounds and bruises. The same month, a coyote viciously attacked a 14month old girl playing in her own front yard. The child required stitches for facial wounds. Adults were nearby during all attacks.Summary: Wild coyote's fear of man fades as the number of \"urban coyotes\" grows; attacks on children are increasing. Coyotes socialized by contact with humans (especially if fed) become bolder and a threat to our children's safety.",

Motor vehicle collisions are the Number 1 Killer and Number 1 health issue for young people in British Columbia. Youth represent 12% of the population and those over 16 years of age are eligible to drive. New inexperienced drivers are twice as likely to cause motor vehicle collisions as are more experienced drivers. The 3 leading causes of MVCs in our province are 1) Speeding 2) Impaired driving and 3) Risk-taking while driving.

Not having ready access to needed medical care and the resulting discontinuity makes being uninsured potentially the sixth leading cause of death among people under age 65. This analysis characterizes the uninsured adult population in New York City (NYC) and investigates the extent of the health care access challenges they face.Methods: We examined data from the New York City Community Health Survey (NYCCHS), a random sample telephone survey of 9,674 noninstitutionalized adults conducted from May-July 2002.Results: Overall, nearly 700,000 (14%) New Yorkers between 18 and 64 reported having no health insurance. Particularly high proportions of individuals were uninsured in foreign-born populations (28%), the Asian-American community (24%), low-income households (22%), and among the unemployed (24%). Most of the uninsured (62%), however, were employed. Neighborhoods in NYC ranged from a low of having a 4% uninsured rate (Gramercy/Upper East Side, Manhattan) to a high of 24% (Greenpoint, Brooklyn). A high proportion of the uninsured had an unmet healthcare need in the past year (31%) compared to others (7%). In terms of preventive services, the uninsured received less care; for example, fewer had their blood pressure checked (68% vs. 91%), or were taking medications if diagnosed with high blood pressure (27% vs. 59%).Implications: Identification of groups most at risk to having large numbers of uninsured people can inform and focus effective interventions. Results: Overall, over 90% of the children were insured. The insured were more likely to have a regular source of care than the uninsured (94% vs. 80%; p = .00). Over 90% of the insured and the uninsured go to their regular source of care for preventive care and for sick care. Of those who did not have a regular source of care, 60% of the insured and 66% of the uninsured went to an ER or community health center for care. In the year before the survey, the insured were more likely to have had a preventive visit (77% vs. 64%; p = .02); dental care (72% vs. 60%; p = .01), prescription (61% vs. 39%; p = .00), and vision care (39% vs. 30%, p = .05). The insured and the uninsured had similar use of illness care (28% vs. 26%) and mental health care (9% vs. 12%). The uninsured reported more unmet need for care than the insured.",

It is important that gains made due to expansion of public insurance programs in the late 1990s not be rolled back during more difficult economic times. Methods: Data from the Ontario physician billing database was used for the analysis. Visits during the SARS period were compared against the visits during the same period the year before. Additionally, two months before the SARS period was compared against the same two months in the previous year.Results: Two months previous to the SARS period, 9,540 patients made 9,789 visits which was a 1.6% increase from the previous year. During the SARS period, 6,957 patients made 7,158 visits which was a 19.7% drop from the previous year. The rankings of the top five diagnoses (anxiety, hypertension, HIV, drugs addiction and common cold) changed slightly during the SARS period compared with the year before but were no different from previous months. There was a significant increase in the number of mental health disorders encounters during the SARS period (20.3% versus 17.2%). No major changes occurred in the number of annual physicals performed.Implications: Utilization of health care services decreased during the SARS outbreak but there were only minor changes in the overall case-mix of the urban population. Patients did not appear to change their reasons for seeking medical care during the outbreak. Results: During the study period 1178 H-UH patients were seen in the ED. 933 were directly discharged to the community and 245 to the RC. (1) 76% of RTC users completed follow-up compared with 31% who were discharged to the community (p < 0.0001). There were significant improvements in follow-up to FP, SW/Psychiatry, ED, Detox/Shelter. There was no significant difference in follow-up for IV therapy or dressing changes. (2)The satisfaction survey was completed by 126 clients (51%), and 79% reported excellent care overall.Implications: The RTC has improved compliance with follow-up care for H-UH.
