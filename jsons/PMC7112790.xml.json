To date, PRRS has spread worldwide and caused enormous economic losses each year (Gao et al., 2004). Recently, the unparalleled large-scale outbreaks of a highly pathogenic PRRS, which spread to many provinces in China, have cause severe economic losses for the Chinese swine industry. Autopsies combined with immunological tests showed clearly that multiple organs were infected by the highly pathogenic PRRSV with severe pathological changes observed (Tian et al., 2007, Li et al., 2007, Normile, 2007). The prerequisite for controlling the disease is a rapid and accurate identification of this organism.",

            "text": "Virus isolation of PRRSV is difficult. This is mainly because the cell of choice for virus isolation is the porcine alveolar macrophage, which needs to be harvested from pigs (preferably specific pathogen free [SPF]) under 6\u20138 weeks of age (Wensvoort et al., 1991, Yoon et al., 1992). Not all laboratories have a ready supply of such pigs available, and continuous cell lines cannot replace fully the alveolar macrophages because these cell lines are generally less susceptible to the virus. In addition, different batches of macrophages are not always equally susceptible to the virus, and results are not obtained rapidly. Although reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a highly sensitive and specific method (Kono et al., 1996, Larochelle and Magar, 1997, Mardassi et al., 1994, Van Woensel et al., 1994), the dependence on special equipment limits its extensive use.",

            "text": "A novel nucleic acid amplification method, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), relies on autocycling strand displacement DNA synthesis performed by Bst DNA polymerase (Notomi et al., 2000, Mori et al., 2001; Nagamine et al., 2002, Chen et al., 2008). Furthermore, reverse transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) method has been applied successfully for the detection of human influenza A virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Newcastle disease virus (Hong et al., 2004, Pham et al., 2005, Poon et al., 2005). In the present study, RT-LAMP method was developed with the HPBEDV strain for the detection of highly pathogenic PRRSV from blood, semen and lung samples. RNA transcripts corresponding to the open reading frames (ORF) 1a (nucleotides 2710\u20132946) of highly pathogenic PRRSV genome were generated to use as standards in the sensitivity analysis of the assay, respectively. A series of the five times dilutions spanning 1 to 55 copies/tube was used as template. Briefly, RNA was extracted from HPBEDV strain using the QIAamp RNA extraction kit. The purified RNA was resuspended in diethylpyrocarbonate treated water and used in the RT-PCR reaction. The amplified product of ORF 1a was cloned into the pCR-XL-TOPO vector (Invitrogen Inc., Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer's directions and sequenced to verify its accuracy. The recombinant plasmid pCR-NSP2 was linearized and gel purified and used as template with a RiboMax T7 In Vitro Transcription System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The length of the RNA transcripts was verified by agarose gel analysis, and the RNA of ORF 1a was quantitated using UV spectrophotometry at 260 nm. To test the applicability of this method, 10 reference strains and one clinical strain of highly pathogenic PRRSV (Table 1\n) were used. Strains were isolated from lung tissues of highly pathogenic PRRSV affected pigs and homogenised with Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (DMEM), freeze\u2013thawed three times and centrifuged at 10,000 \u00d7 \ng for 10 min. The supernatant was passed through a 0.22-\u03bcm filter and adapted to Marc-145 cell monolayers. The cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 5 days and examined for cytopathic effects (CPE) daily. After the appearance of CPE, viral isolates were stored at \u221270 \u00b0C until used. RNA was extracted by using a RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). For further evaluation of RT-LAMP assay with clinical specimens, 122 specimens of blood, semen and lung tissue were obtained from highly pathogenic PRRSV-infected pigs (Table 2\n). The specimens were frozen at \u221270 \u00b0C until transported and tested.",

RT-LAMP products for highly pathogenic PRRSV and PRRSV-infected blood, semen and lung samples were analyzed by electrophoresis with 2.5% agarose gels (Fig. 1A). All the strains tested by RT-LAMP were also identified by nested RT-PCR and sequenced. The details of primers and condition for nested RT-PCR assay for the detection of PRRSV have been previously described (Christopher-Hennings et al., 1995), with minor modifications. The outer sense and antisense primers were N1F and N1R and the nested sense and antisense primers were N2F and N2R, respectively(Table 3). A good correlation was found for all of the highly pathogenic PRRSV strains which were positive by the RT-LAMP and nested RT-PCR.",

The results indicated that this diagnostic technique was reliable for the detection of highly pathogenic PRRSV in blood, semen and lung tissue samples. Semen and blood are the preferred samples during the early stage of infection, which may have a higher predictive value of detecting highly pathogenic PRRSV infection during disease surveillance screening. Importantly, the early detection of highly pathogenic PRRSV suggests potential value as a surveillance tool in areas free of the disease and as a screening assay for monitoring an outbreak.",
