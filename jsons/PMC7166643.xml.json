            "text": "Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in children, especially in developing countries [Razanajatovo et al., 2011]. The etiology of ARIs is often unknown, because viral testing among patients with respiratory symptoms is uncommon [Ju et al., 2014]. Many countries conduct influenza\u2010like illness (ILI) surveillance, and monitor cases of respiratory illness with fever. Data from these surveillance systems suggest that ILI is caused by a wide range of respiratory viruses, including seasonal influenza A and B viruses (FLU A and FLU B), respiratory syncytial viruses A and B (RSV A and RSV B), parainfluenza viruses 1\u20134 (PIVs 1\u20134), human rhinovirus (HRV), adenovirus (ADV), and others [Ren et al., 2009; Buecher et al., 2010; Razanajatovo et al., 2011; Thiberville et al., 2012]. Recent advances in molecular detection techniques have facilitated the identification of several novel respiratory viruses that could also cause influenza\u2010like illness, such as human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human bocavirus (HBoV), human coronavirus (HCoV\u2010NL63 and HKU1), and more [van der Hoogen et al., 2001; van der Hoek et al., 2004; Woo et al., 2005; Allander et al., 2007].",

In China, as in other countries, only 10\u201330% of influenza\u2010like illnesses are caused by influenza virus [Thomas, 2014; Otomaru et al., 2015]. Identifying ILI causative agents based on clinical signs and symptoms is difficult, because most respiratory illnesses, regardless of etiology, lead to similar clinical presentations. In addition, there are limited data on the incidence and clinical presentation of respiratory infections caused by viruses other than influenza in China [Peng et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013; Ju et al., 2014; Fu et al., 2015].",

After obtaining informed consent from the parent or guardian, physicians enrolled all children less than 5 years of age who met the ILI case definition on any data collection day.

While the differences in percent positive among studies might be explained by numerous factors, including case definition, specimen types, and population distribution, one factor that may have led to an underestimation of cases testing positive for at least one virus in our study is that, unlike the studies in Huizhou [Ju et al., 2014] and Wuhan [Peng et al., 2012], we did not used the commercial kit to test the viruses, which might affect the yield. In addition, we did not test for viral pathogens such as human rhinovirus and human coronavirus, which are common etiologies of ARIs in children [Cui et al., 2011; Song et al., 2013].

Of note, these European studies were all carried out during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic period, which may have influenced the spectrum of viruses circulating at the time. During the influenza pandemic period, the activity of several non\u2010influenza respiratory viruses was reduced or delayed compared to non\u2010pandemic periods.",

In our study, RSV was the second most commonly detected virus after influenza virus. RSV infection occurred predominantly in the spring and winter seasons, and the 2013\u20132014 winter peak of RSV overlapped with the influenza virus peak. RSV commonly confounds the study of the epidemiology and disease burden of influenza. The co\u2010circulation of RSV with influenza virus impacts the sensitivity and positive predictive value of ILI surveillance for influenza activity [Tang et al., 2010; Ruf and Knuf, 2014]. Therefore, when capacity does not allow for laboratory confirmation of respiratory viruses, epidemiologists should consider how RSV may impact ILI surveillance data, as RSV is likely contributing to ILI disease burden, particularly in December\u2013April.",

For example, compared with other viruses, influenza was more frequently associated with convulsion, RSV was more likely to cause cough and wheezing, HBoV more often caused rhinorrhea, while PIV and ADV were more likely to cause vomiting and diarrhea. These results are consistent with other studies, suggesting that, despite the common, non\u2010specific signs and symptoms associated with respiratory illness, infection with each virus can lead to differences in clinical presentation [Chen et al., 2004; Kesebir et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2014], while these differences are probably too subtle to guide clinical diagnosis and empiric treatment.",

First, we did not detect other viruses known to cause ILI in children, such as human rhinoviruses and human coronavirus, which likely led to an underestimation of our viral positive rate among ILI cases. Second, the lack of controls may be a more relevant issue given that some of these viruses could have been associated with carriage or shedding from a previous or impending illness event, particularly during co\u2010infections. Third, the loss of sensitivity inherent in the use of the ILI case definition (particularly as operationalized as measured fever) and throat swabs alone. It was reported that using ILI which requires measure fever could drop the sensitivity by >10% and that only obtaining throat swabs could drop the sensitivity by another 10% [Dawood et al., 2015].",
