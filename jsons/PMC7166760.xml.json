These outbreaks result from zoonotic coronavirus crossing the species barrier and causing high morbidity and mortality in human populations.\n3\n, \n4\n The 2019\u2010nCoV, SARS\u2010CoV, and MERS\u2010CoV show several similarities regarding the clinical presentations, which can vary from asymptomatic infection to severe disease; severe acute respiratory syndrome.\n5\n, \n6\n Therefore, our current knowledge of the biology and pathology of SARS\u2010CoV and MERS\u2010CoV may provide clues for ongoing and future research efforts concerning the investigation of the 2019\u2010nCoV.
