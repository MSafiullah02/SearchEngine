The pathogenicity is the ability to induce disease, which is characterized by its virulence (infection severity, determined by the germ morbidity and mortality rates) and the level of invasiveness (capacity to invade tissues). No microorganism is completely avirulent. An organism may have a very low level of virulence, but if the host (i.e., patient or health care provider) is highly susceptible, infection by the organism may cause disease. The risk of infection increases with the infecting dose (the number of organisms available to induce disease), the reservoir (the site where the organisms reside and multiply), and the infection source (the site from where it is transmitted to a susceptible host either directly or indirectly through an intermediary object). The infection source may be a human (e.g., health care providers, children, visitors, housekeeping personnel) with a symptomatic or an asymptomatic infection during the incubation period. The source may also be temporarily or permanently colonized (the most frequently colonized tissues are the skin, digestive, and respiratory tracts).",

The organism may enter the host through the skin, mucous membranes, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, or the bloodstream via IV solutions, after laryngoscopy, or from surgical wounds. Organisms may also infect the individual because of work accidents with cutting or piercing devices. The development of infection is influenced by the host defense mechanisms that may be classified as either nonspecific or specific:\u25a0\nNonspecific defense mechanisms include the skin, mucous membranes, secretions, excretions, enzymes, inflammatory responses, genetic factors, hormonal responses, nutritional status, behavior patterns, and the presence of other diseases.\u25a0\nSpecific defense mechanisms or immunity may occur because of exposure to an infectious agent (antibody formation) or through placental transfer of antibodies; artificial defenses may be acquired through vaccines, toxoids, or exogenously administered immunoglobulins.\n",

            "text": "Droplet contamination is considered a direct transmission of organisms because there is a direct transfer of microorganisms from the colonized or infected person to the host. This generally occurs with particles whose diameters are greater than 5 \u00b5m that are expelled from an individual's mouth or nose, mainly during sneezing, coughing, talking, or during procedures such as suction, laryngoscopy, and bronchoscopy (Fig. 50.2\n). Transmission occurs when the microorganism-containing droplets, expelled or shed by the infected person (source), are propelled a short distance (usually not exceeding 60 cm or about 2 feet through the air) and deposited on the host's conjunctivae or oral or nasal mucous membranes. Droplets remain suspended for only a short duration and distance from the source, but this may be affected by temperature, humidity, force of expulsion, and air currents. Larger particle sizes contact the mucosa of the upper airway, whereas aerosols are capable of penetrating into the lower respiratory tract. Infectious agents vary in their affinity for receptors in different regions of the respiratory tract.9, 10 When a person coughs, the exhaled air may reach a speed of up to 965 km/hour (600 mph).11 However, because the droplets are relatively large, they tend to descend quickly and remain suspended in the air for a very brief period, thus obviating the need for special handling procedures for the OR air. Examples of droplet-borne diseases include influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, mumps, pertussis, rhinovirus, rubella, and Ebola. Droplet precautions include communication of infectious risk between caregivers, single room isolation, gown, glove, mask, and eye protection. Patients undergoing surgery must be brought directly to the OR and recover in isolation. Some medical interventions (intubation, extubation, biphasic airway pressure [BiPAP], continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP], bronchoscopy, sputum induction, open airway suction) are categorized as aerosol-generating procedures. When performing an aerosol-generating procedure on a patient with an infectious disease that can be transmitted through droplets, the recommendation is to maximize protection by using airborne precautions.10\n",

The physical transfer of microorganisms from an infected or colonized person to a susceptible host may occur from child to health care provider or from health care provider to child during professional practice (e.g., venous cannulation, laryngoscopy, burn care, or suction of secretions). Health care providers working in the OR may be exposed to skin contamination by body fluids. This is an issue of grave concern because of the potential exposure of health care providers to patients with unrecognized infections, especially hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Hepatitis B is a highly infectious virus that requires a small amount of blood (10\u22127\u201310\u22129 mL) to transmit the disease. The incidence of skin contamination of anesthesiologists and related personnel by blood and saliva is substantial. One study examined 270 anesthetic procedures during 7 consecutive days. The blood of 35 patients (14%) contaminated the skin of 65 anesthesiologists in 46 incidents. Of these contamination events, 28 (61%) occurred during venous cannulation. Of anesthesiologists who had been contaminated by blood, 5 of 65 (8%) had cuts in the skin of their hands.13 The importance of this observation is that seroconversion of health care providers has been reported after skin contamination by infected blood from HIV carriers14 and HBV infection after blood splashing into health care workers' (HCWs') eyes.15 Scabies, pediculosis, and herpes simplex are among the diseases most frequently transmitted by direct contact.16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 Meticulous hand washing before and after every patient contact and routine use of barriers such as gloves and eye protection are essential basic methods for protecting ourselves even during routine procedures such as starting an IV line or performing laryngoscopy.4\n",

The skin contamination of patients with enteric organisms inspired the rather graphic description, the patient's \u201cfecal patina.\u201d31 Also referred to as a \u201cstool veneer,\u201d this coating with enteric organisms is limited not only to patients' skin but also extends to surfaces in the surrounding environment that are touched, and thereby contaminated, by patients and by HCWs. The environmental contamination spreads out from the patient in a target-like concentric pattern, with the densest contamination closest to the rectum of patients who have rectal carriage of the problem bacteria. This interplay among organisms on patients' body surfaces, hospital environment, and HCWs' hands constitutes the foundation for the development of infection control interventions in the field of hospital epidemiology.30\n",

In this report, provider hands were less likely to serve as a transmitter of infection than contaminated environmental or patient skin surfaces. These findings have clinical implications for the risk of colonization and subsequent HCIs\u2014for example, SSIs. This calls attention to the need to develop and enforce strict hand hygiene guidelines for personnel who are providing anesthesia care, but more importantly the need to increase compliance with environmental disinfection of the OR (between cases and terminal cleaning), and to study further the directions of the spread of pathogens in the OR and anesthesia work areas. This study unequivocally underscores our need to improve cleaning procedures in the OR and equipment surfaces to reduce infection risk.",

            "text": "There are also reports of equipment, fomites, and drugs (mainly propofol) that have resulted in hospital-acquired infections.20, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51 Propofol is widely used for both inpatient and outpatient anesthesia. This hypnotic agent is a nutrient-rich drug. It is hypothesized that propofol increases bacterial contamination of IV stopcocks and may compromise safety of IV tubing sets when continued to be used after propofol anesthesia. There is a covert incidence of IV stopcock bacterial contamination during anesthesia that is aggravated by the prior presence of propofol. Propofol may increase the risk for postoperative infection because of bacterial growth in IV stopcock dead spaces.52 Other facets that may also contribute to infection include the following:\u25a0Up to 40% of anesthetic equipment in direct or indirect contact with a child (blood pressure cuffs, cables, oximeters, laryngoscopes, monitors, respirator settings, and horizontal and vertical surfaces) may be contaminated with blood because of inadequate cleansing procedures between uses.6, 7, 27, 53, 54\n\u25a0In some institutions, up to 8% of the Bain circuits that were reused without previous sterilization were contaminated.55\n\u25a0Contamination of syringe contents has occurred with glass particles during ampule opening, which in turn may compromise the sterility of the contents, presumably because of the passage of bacteria contained on glass particles into the solution.56, 57, 58\n\u25a0IV tubing has both blood contamination as well as contamination by blood from syringes used to inject medications. This can occur with the absence of visible blood reflux in the tubing or syringe. Simply replacing the needle on a syringe that will be reused is ineffective in preventing cross-infection; it is essential to not use the same syringe in multiple patients.59\n\u25a0Refilling both glass and plastic syringes several times has also been shown to result in contamination of the contents; single use is therefore recommended.59, 60\n\u25a0Some drug formulations, especially propofol, can sustain bacterial growth under certain conditions. Thus great care should be given to aseptic technique when transferring drugs from the vial to a syringe and to use the contents of the syringe within 4 hours.61, 62, 63, 64, 65 Propofol vials should not be used for multiple patients because of concerns for cross-contamination, particularly since not all countries have added antimicrobials to the propofol emulsion.66, 67\n\u25a0Needles that have been used for spinal or epidural anesthesia were contaminated with coagulase-negative staphylococci (15.7%), yeasts (1.5%), enterococci (0.8%), pneumococci (0.8%), and micrococci (0.8%), suggesting that there may be needle contamination despite standard skin preparation and cleansing.68 It is unclear whether these skin organisms can be transmitted and cause an infection during administration of a neuraxial block.\u25a0Blood and saliva frequently contaminate the skin of anesthetic personnel during routine anesthetic practice.13\n\u25a0Violations of contemporary guidelines for preventing infections (e.g., hand washing, wearing gloves, surgical masks, ocular protection, scrubs, or syringe reuse) by anesthesiologists are frequent.4 Anesthesia staff are aware that they work in a potentially infectious environment, but they commonly do not adopt appropriate protective measures to reduce infections in both themselves and their patients (11%\u201399%).27, 69, 70, 71\n\n",

Evidence suggests that this is the main route of HIV, HBV, and HCV infection,72, 73, 74 especially if the injury is caused by hollow-bore needles that were used to draw blood or establish IV access.75, 76 Over 20 other bloodborne pathogens have been transmitted by this means, including those causing herpes, malaria, and tuberculosis.77 The risk of exposure to blood and bloodborne pathogens is greater for health care personnel (HCP) than for people who do not work around blood. An exposure to infected blood, tissue, or other potentially infectious body fluids can occur by percutaneous injury or contact with mucous membrane or nonintact skin. The risk of infection after an exposure depends on a number of variables and appears to be greater with exposure to a larger quantity of blood or other infectious fluid; prolonged or extensive exposure of nonintact skin or mucous membrane to blood or other infectious fluid or concentrated virus in a laboratory setting; exposure to the blood of a patient in an advanced disease stage or with a higher HIV viral load; a deep percutaneous injury; a procedure wherein the sharp was in the vein or artery of an infected source patient; an injury with a hollow-bore, blood-filled needle; and limited or delayed access to postexposure prophylaxis. After exposure, the risk of infection varies for specific bloodborne pathogens. For HBV, if the source patient has active HBV and the HCP do not already have immunity, the risk for infection after percutaneous injury is between 1% and 30%. If the source patient has active HCV, the risk of hepatitis C transmission is approximately 1.8% (range 0%\u20137%) after a percutaneous injury. If the source patient has HIV infection, the risk of HIV transmission is approximately 0.3% after a percutaneous exposure and 0.09% after a mucous membrane exposure. The risk of HIV transmission for an exposure with nonintact skin has not been determined and is estimated to be less than the risk after a mucous membrane exposure.78\n",

The distribution of these accidents among anesthesiologists is shown in Fig. 50.5A\n; the distribution of the items most frequently associated with cutting and piercing injuries in health care providers is shown in Fig. 50.5B. Should such an accident occur (e.g., needle puncture, exposure to nonintact skin, or mucous membrane exposure), there are now specific recommendations regarding immediate assessment of risk, assessment of the exposure source (chart review, inform the patient that an accident has occurred and ask permission to determine HBV, HCV, and HIV serologic status), and rapid initiation of appropriate antiviral treatment of the HCW.82 It is advised to obtain as much information regarding the patient as possible\u2014if the patient is known\u2014to (1) obtain a sample of blood from the patient for determination of potential carrier state (Table 50.4\n) and (2) report to the health service for immediate institution of prophylaxis and follow-up (Table 50.5\n), especially for HIV exposure (Tables 50.6\nand 50.7\n).",

One positive example of such education is that anesthesiologists who have read the CDC's Universal Precaution Guidelines for the Prevention of Occupational Transmission of HIV and HBV have developed better hygienic practices.69\n\u25a0Provide HCWs with hepatitis A and B vaccine and document that an appropriate immunologic response was achieved. Provide hepatitis A and B immune globulins (HAIG, HBIG) for those exposed who do not have established immunity.8\n\u25a0Provide a health care service for employees for counseling and postexposure prophylaxis should an exposure to HIV occur.101\n\u25a0Provide regular surveillance of HCWs to determine established immunity to infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox. Lack of immunity may require immunization; several studies have demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of immunization (for prevention of disease) versus the cost of replacement of HCWs who have become infected.73, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107\n\n",

It is vital to have in place proper systems to (1) remove contaminated air, (2) facilitate air management requirements to protect susceptible health care providers and children against hospital-related airborne pathogens, and (3) minimize the risk of airborne pathogens being transmitted by children. Many regulatory institutions, such as the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health; the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers; the CDC; and the American Institute of Architects (AIA), have developed standards and guidelines for OR ventilation systems. As in any other environment, ventilation in the OR is an important issue to control infection from microbiologic pollutants. Most wound contamination in the OR is the result of the patient's skin flora and bacteria shed on airborne particles from the OR personnel. Room ventilation affects the distribution of these airborne particles in four ways: total ventilation (dilution), air distribution (directional airflow), room pressurization (filtration barrier), and filtration (contaminant removal). As the air flows of the room increase, the greater the dilutional effect on airborne particles. Balancing this phenomenon is important because while increased flow increases the effectiveness of air exchange, the resultant turbulent flow increases microbial distribution throughout the room. Low-velocity unidirectional flow minimizes the spread of microbes in the room. Directional flow can be inward, from the outside into the OR (negative pressure), or outward, from the OR to the outside (positive pressure). Negative-pressure ventilation is used for highly infective rooms in the hospital (e.g., isolation rooms for tuberculosis patients), and positive-pressure ventilation is used for protective environments (e.g., ORs and rooms with immunocompromised patients). Most hospital ORs are currently designed with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration systems to maximize removal of airborne contaminants. OR ventilation systems should operate at all times, except during maintenance. During unoccupied hours, air exchange can be reduced as long as positive pressure is maintained in each OR. Air is delivered to each OR from the ceiling, with downward movement toward several exhaust or return ducts near the floor. This design helps provide steady movement of clean air through the breathing and working zones.",

            "text": "The AIA has specific guidelines for the location of outside fresh air inlets to minimize contamination from exhaust systems and noxious fumes. A greater air inflow rate and a larger air-inlet area are desirable for contaminant control, but these approaches are detrimental to the thermal comfort of the staff and patient.108 The AIA recommends an air-change rate in an OR of 20 to 25 air changes per hour (ACH) for ceiling heights between 9 feet (2.74 meters) and 12 feet (3.66 meters). Some controversy exists between engineers and clinicians over the need for laminar airflow ventilation in the OR to further minimize airborne infection. Careful mathematical analyses of airflow suggest that laminar airflow is not necessary. Clinical studies are confirmatory. Similarly, the use of ultraviolet light to cleanse the room air is no longer recommended.109\nTable 50.8\nshows the 2003 Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee and CDC general recommendations for ventilation system specifications for the OR.12 Children with tuberculosis require special consideration because of the high risk of occupational transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis,110, 111 especially after the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains (Table 50.9\n). An easy preventive measure is to screen all children before coming to the OR to determine recent exposure to infectious disease such as measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox because these infections can pose a significant risk to HCWs and patients, especially those who are immunocompromised.73, 106 Another potential source for airborne spread of pathogens is through the anesthesia circuit; this may be reduced by the use of circuit filters. However, at present there are no regulatory requirements to use such devices, and performance characteristics vary widely.28, 29, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116\n",

Hand hygiene is a well-known and effective solution to the problem of bacterial transmission within and across patients. Compliance with the current \u201c5 moments\u201d World Health Organization guidelines could make a major inroad into reducing provider hand and workspace contamination. One study found that only 20% of anesthesia providers demonstrated complete knowledge regarding WHO hand hygiene guidelines.125 Failure of providers to recognize prior contact with the environment and prior contact with the patient as hand hygiene opportunities contributed to this low percentage. Several cognitive factors were associated with a reduced risk of incomplete knowledge, including providers responding positively to washing their hands after contact with the environment, disinfecting their environment during patient care, believing that they can influence their colleagues, and intending to adhere to guidelines. These results suggest that anesthesia providers have knowledge deficits pertaining to opportunity-based hand hygiene in the intraoperative arena125\u2014specifically, after interactions with patient skin surfaces and the surrounding environment, the two most important reservoirs of intraoperative bacterial transmission.",

            "text": "Hand washing is considered the most important and cost-effective individual intervention in the prevention of HAIs in children and health care providers.126 Its importance in medical practice had not been universally accepted, despite the pioneering work by Oliver Wendell Holmes127 (1843) and Ignaz Semmelweis128 (1846), who separately recognized that the contaminated hands of physicians performing autopsies were the vectors responsible for the spread of puerperal fever caused by streptococci. They demonstrated that hand washing before delivering a baby reduced the risk of infectious transmission and maternal mortality by 90%! Unfortunately, the scientific basis for hand washing was not established until the introduction of the germ theory of disease by Louis Pasteur129 and the discovery of the microorganism that caused anthrax (Bacillus anthracis) by Robert Koch130 in the late 19th century. More than one-and-a-half centuries later, and with strong evidence that health care providers are a leading source of hospital acquired infections,3, 24, 131 the average frequency of hand hygiene episodes fluctuates with the method used for monitoring and the setting where the observations are conducted. Hand washing per hour may vary over 30-fold. On the other hand, the average number of opportunities for hand hygiene per HCW varies markedly between hospital wards; nurses in pediatric wards, for example, had an average of eight opportunities for hand hygiene per hour of patient care, compared with an average of 30 for ICU nurses. In some acute clinical situations, the patient is cared for by several HCWs contemporaneously and, on average, as many hand hygiene opportunities per patient per hour of care have been observed per provider as in a postanesthesia care unit (PACU) admission. The number of opportunities for hand hygiene depends largely on the process of care provided132: revision of protocols for patient care may reduce unnecessary contacts and, consequently, improve hand hygiene opportunities. In 11 observational studies, the duration of hand cleansing episodes by HCWs ranged, on average, from as little as 6.6 seconds to 30 seconds. In 10 of these studies, the hand hygiene technique monitored was hand washing, while handrubbing was monitored in one study. In addition to washing their hands for very short time periods, HCWs often failed to cover all surfaces of their hands and fingers. Therefore the number of hand hygiene opportunities per hour of care may be very large and, even if the hand hygiene compliance rate is large, the applied cleansing technique may be inadequate. Adherence of HCWs to recommended hand hygiene procedures varies from unacceptably poor (5%) to relatively good (89%) with an overall mean rate of 38.7% in the ICU, OR, and PACU.133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139 A number of investigators reported improved adherence after implementing various interventions, but most studies had only short follow-up. Few studies have reported sustained improvement. There are hospital-wide predictors of poor adherence to recommended hand hygiene measures during routine patient care. These include professional category, hospital ward, time of day/week, and type and intensity of patient care, defined as the number of opportunities for hand hygiene per hour of patient care. Nonadherence was the least among nurses and during weekends. Nonadherence was greater in ICUs compared with internal medicine, during procedures that carried a substantial risk of bacterial contamination, and when intensity of patient care was high. In other words, the greater the demand for hand hygiene, the poorer the adherence. The poorest adherence rate (36%) was found in ICUs, where indications for hand hygiene were typically more frequent (on average, 22 opportunities per patient-hour). The greatest adherence rate (59%) was observed in pediatrics, where the average intensity of patient care was smaller than elsewhere (on average, 8 opportunities per patient-hour). The results suggest that full adherence to guidelines is unrealistic and that easy access to hand hygiene at the point of patient care, (i.e., in particular, alcohol-based handrubbing) could help improve adherence to hand hygiene.",

            "text": "Although pediatric-specific prophylaxis data are sparse, available data have been evaluated for specific procedures. Selection of antimicrobial prophylactic agents mirrors that in adult guidelines, with the agents of choice being first- and second-generation cephalosporins, reserving the use of vancomycin for patients with documented \u03b2-lactam allergies. While the use of a penicillin with a \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor in combination with cefazolin or vancomycin and gentamicin has also been studied in pediatric patients, the number of patients included in these evaluations remains small. As with adults, there is little evidence supporting the use of vancomycin, alone or in combination with other antimicrobials, for routine perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis in institutions that have a high prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Vancomycin may be considered in children known to be colonized with MRSA and decreases MRSA infections.150 Mupirocin is effective in children colonized with MRSA, but there are limited data supporting its use perioperatively.151, 152 Most recommendations for adults are the same for pediatric patients. Dosing recommendations in pediatric patients are limited and have been extrapolated from adult data; therefore nearly all pediatric recommendations are based on expert opinion. Pediatric efficacy data are few. Fluoroquinolones should not be routinely used for surgical prophylaxis in pediatric patients because of the potential for toxicity in this population. The same principle of preoperative dosing within 60 minutes before incision has been applied to pediatric patients. Additional intraoperative dosing may be needed if the duration of the procedure exceeds two half-lives of the antimicrobial agent or there is excessive blood loss during the procedure. As with adult patients, single-dose prophylaxis is usually sufficient. If antimicrobial prophylaxis is continued postoperatively, the duration should be less than 24 hours, regardless of the presence of intravascular catheters or indwelling drains. There are sufficient pharmacokinetic studies of most agents to recommend pediatric dosages that provide adequate systemic exposure and, presumably, efficacy comparable to that demonstrated in adults. Therefore the pediatric doses recommended in guidelines are based largely on pharmacokinetic data and the extrapolation of adult efficacy data to pediatric patients. Because few clinical trials have been conducted in pediatric surgical patients, strength of evidence criteria have not been applied to these recommendations. With few exceptions (e.g., aminoglycoside dosages), pediatric doses should not exceed the maximum adult recommended dosages. Generally, if a dose is calculated on a milligram-per-kilogram basis for children weighing more than 40 kg, the calculated dosage will likely exceed the maximum recommended dose for adults; adult dosages should therefore be used for larger children.153\n",

However, the incidence of severe allergic reactions to first-generation cephalosporins in children with reported allergy to penicillin is rare (but not zero)158, 159; furthermore, skin testing does not reliably predict the likelihood of adverse reactions to cephalosporins in those with reported allergy to penicillin.160, 161, 162 There is no evidence of any risk of cross-reactivity between penicillin and second- and third-generation cephalosporins. For the most part, \u201callergies\u201d to oral antibiotics that appear on children's charts (rash, vomiting, gastrointestinal disturbances) are reactions to the additives in the antibiotic formulation, including food dyes, fillers, and other compounds, or a manifestation of the underlying infection. IV administration of small test doses of the pure antibiotic in a fully monitored (and anesthetized) child will determine whether the child is at risk for an allergic reaction to the antibiotic. In the case of surgical procedures where antibiotic prophylaxis is mainly directed at gram-positive cocci, children who are truly allergic to \u03b2-lactams (cephalosporins) should receive either vancomycin or clindamycin.163 However, in those children where the history is consistent with either an IgE-mediated penicillin allergy (urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis, bronchospasm) or a severe non\u2013IgE-mediated reaction (interstitial nephritis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, hemolytic anemia, or Stevens-Johnson syndrome) it is advisable to switch out the cefazolin. Cross-sensitivity occurs when the R1 side chains of the penicillins and cephalosporins are similar, which perhaps surprisingly is not the case with cefazolin. Cephalosporins with R1 side chains similar to penicillins include cephalexin, cefaclor, and cefadroxil. The risk associated with use of first- or second-generation cephalosporins with dissimilar side chains, or third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins, \u201cappears to be very low in patients with mild-to-moderate reactions to penicillin G, ampicillin, or amoxicillin. Dismissing cefazolin use when there is a vague history of any penicillin allergy should be reconsidered.\u201d\n155\n",

The use of antibiotic prophylaxis for postoperative infections is well established for clean-contaminated procedures. Within the clean category, prophylaxis has been traditionally reserved for surgical procedures involving a foreign body implantation or for any surgical procedure where an SSI would be catastrophic (e.g., cardiac surgery or neurosurgical procedures). However, there is evidence that postoperative infections resulting from procedures not involving prosthetic elements are underreported; estimates show that more than 50% of all complications occur after the patient is discharged and are thus unrecognized by the surgical team. Therefore antibiotic prophylaxis is also recommended for certain procedures, such as herniorrhaphy.164, 165 The direct and indirect costs of these complications may not affect the hospital budget; however, they represent a substantial cost for the community at large. In the case of contaminated or dirty procedures, bacterial contamination or infection is established before the procedure begins. Accordingly, the perioperative administration of antibiotics is a therapeutic, not a prophylactic, measure. The use of antibiotics in children has implications not only for the response to the current treatment but also to future treatments. Thus all medical professionals are jointly responsible for the rational use of antibiotics.",
