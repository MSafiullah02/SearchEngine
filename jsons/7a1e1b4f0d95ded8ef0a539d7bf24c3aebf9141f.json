Primary routes of transmission of the causative virus, severe acute respiratory 25 syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), are through respiratory droplets and close person-to-26 person contact. While information about other potential modes of transmission are relatively 27 sparse, evidence supporting the possibility of a fecally-mediated mode of transmission has been 28 accumulating. Here, current knowledge on the potential for fecal transmission is briefly reviewed 29 and the possible implications are discussed from a public health perspective.",

The primary routes of transmission of the virus, 36 SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2), are through respiratory 37 droplets and close person-to-person contact, but knowledge about other potential modes of 38 transmission (e.g., fomite-based, vertical, and fecal-oral transmission) remains relatively sparse 39 (Cai et al., 2020a , Chen H. et al., 2020 , Ghinai et al., 2020 , Gu et al., 2020 Doremalen et al., , Wang W. et al., 2020 , Yeo et al., 2020 . However, 41 recently, evidence supporting the possibility of a fecally-mediated route of transmission has been 42 accumulating , Gu et al., 2020 , He et al., 2020 , Wang W. et al., 2020 et al., . Specifically, an increasing number of studies have detected 44 the presence of viral RNA in stool from COVID-19 patients, and to date, there are at least three 45 reports of viable virus having been identified in patient stool samples (Wang W. et al., 2020, 46 Xiao et al., , Zhang Yong et al., 2020 . Given the quickly evolving situation, it is imperative 47 that the most current information be considered in the ongoing public health response to 19. In this article, recent evidence about the potential for fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is 49 briefly summarized, and the possible implications for transmission mitigation and disease control 50 are discussed from a public health perspective. can be shed in feces (Corman et al., 2014 , Dominguez et al., 2007 , Drosten et al., 2013 , Kim et 56 al., 2016 , Xu et al., 2005 . For example, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus 57 (MERS-CoV) has been detected in fecal samples from some infected individuals at low viral 58 loads (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, Corman et al., 2016 , Drosten et al., 2013 , Wu 59 et al., 2015 , though there have been no confirmed cases of fecal transmission, to our knowledge 60 (Bak et al., 2018) . Similarly, after the 2002 SARS epidemic, which was caused by a virus 61 (SARS-CoV) that shares ~80% genetic homology with SARS-CoV-2, fecal shedding was noted 62 in a subset of patients (Cheng et al., 2004 , Xu et al., 2005 , and SARS-CoV RNA was detected in 63 sewage water from Beijing hospitals that were treating SARS patients, though infectious virions 64 were not identified (Lee, 2003 , Wang et al., 2005a , Wang et al., 2005b , Yeo et al., 2020 .",

A 112 small number of studies have addressed the former directly (Wang W. et al., 2020 , Xiao et al., 113 2020 , Zhang Yong et al., 2020 . The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) 114 isolated viable SARS-CoV-2 from a stool sample of a laboratory-confirmed patient from 115 Heilongjiang Province, China about 15 days after onset of disease (Zhang Yong et al., 2020) . In 116 a recent study, Wang et al. cultured 4 patient stool specimens that had high viral RNA copy 117 numbers and was able to use electron microscopy to observe live virus in two of them (Wang W. 118 et al., 2020) . Additionally, Xiao et al. briefly mentioned having identified live virions from stool, 119 but details are unavailable, as the data are yet unpublished . Because these 120 findings are based on a very small number of patients, additional studies are strongly warranted J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f on how frequently viable virus is present in patient stool, and when present, what the range of 122 viral loads may be, particularly because the ability of the virus to be spread through fecal 123 transmission is largely contingent on these factors. It is presently believed that SARS-CoV-2 124 may have a low infective dose (Lee and Hsueh, 2020) , implying that low viral loads in stool 125 could still be a concern for transmissibility.",

Many places that have enacted social 219 distancing or shelter in place orders to reduce COVID-19 incidence classify restaurants as an 220 essential service and permit them to serve take-out food (U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 221 2020). Thus, public health agencies should engage in educational tactics to inform staff who 222 handle food that fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 may be possible. Screening food handlers 223 for fever or obvious symptoms each day is a proactive step that restaurants and grocery stores 224 can also consider.",

If future research establishes that viable virus can be found in241 stool at potentially relevant doses, this would support the need for further precautions in 242 residences, public restrooms, and numerous other facilities. Use of an effective disinfectant to 243 frequently and thoroughly sanitize surfaces and objects is a mainstay of prevention of fomite-244 based transmission. 245 Finally, it should be noted that as hospitals reach capacity and extend patient care to 246 overflow facilities, appropriate engineering controls need to be in place, especially in case of a 247 shortage of PPE (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, 2020b), and the specific 248 environmental control strategies could vary depending on whether transmission is commonly 249 occurring through multiple routes. For instance, indoor restroom facilities may need to be 250 carefully inspected in any high-capacity facility, such as a dormitory or hotel, to avoid a situation 251 like the Amory Gardens SARS outbreak. 252 Out of an abundance of caution, the public health community should continue to 253 contemplate what additional preventive measures or recommendations, with regard to hygiene, 254 environmental disinfection, engineering controls, and other avenues, may be warranted based on 255 the currently available evidence about potential fecal transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. While 256 existing measures (e.g., social distancing measures, stay at home orders, hand hygiene education J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f campaigns, etc.) may be helpful in the context of our present understanding of how COVID-19 is 258 transmitted, there are many other public health strategies that can be considered if new evidence 259 consistently supports possible fecal transmissibility. 260 Conclusions 261 Our understanding of COVID-19 is advancing rapidly, and future research on all possible 262 modes of transmission are strongly justified given the scale of this pandemic. Current knowledge 263 on whether fecal transmissibility (either orally, through fomites, or by aspiration of fecally-264 contaminated droplets) is likely to be an important mode of COVID-19 spread is still limited. In 265 particular, evidence about whether infectious virions can be found in stool is based on a small 266 number of patients whose specimens were collected at different times over the course of illness 267 or convalescence. Further research is warranted to elucidate whether SARS-CoV-2 is present in 268 stool at potentially infectious doses, and if so, to assess the duration of viral persistence in fecal 269 matter. These questions are of public health significance and should be examined in larger 270 studies to help inform future disease mitigation guidelines. Efforts to test for the presence of 271 SARS-CoV-2 in sewage are already underway in some cities, and very preliminary evidence 272 suggests that viral RNA may be detectable in sewage samples in certain circumstances 273 (BioBot.io, Medema et al., 2020). Additional research on whether the virus is consistently 274 detectable in other bodily fluids, such as breast milk, sweat, or semen, would also help fill some 275 important gaps in the current literature.",
