            "text": "Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a systemic vasculitis syndrome including microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangitis (EGPA) and renal-limited vasculitis (RLV). The diagnosis of AAV is based on the presence of clinical manifestations with characteristic histopathological findings and the presence of MPO-ANCA or PR3-ANCA [1\u20137]. AAV may have predominant involvement of the upper respiratory tract, lungs, kidneys, skin, and nervous system. Most patients with AAV achieved remission after appropriate immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, including cyclophosphamide (CYC), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and rituximab (RTX) [8\u201311]. Nevertheless, infection after immunosuppressive therapy contributes to the most common cause of death. The burden of infectious disease in patients with AAV has been reported [1\u20136, 12\u201315]. Nonetheless, risk infectors reported so far are inconsistent. In this study, we retrospectively analysed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of Chinese patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis and discussed major infection episodes occurring during immunosuppressive therapy in a single centre.",

Immediate dialysis was defined as the clinical necessity of renal replacement therapy on admission. The first immunosuppressive agent used in addition to corticosteroids was termed induction therapy. The immunosuppressive regimen used during follow-up was termed the maintenance agent. The diagnosis criteria for deep fungal infection included clinical manifestations, such as fever, cough, diarrhoea or lower urinary tract symptoms, and the detection of fungi in sputum, urine, stool or tissue specimens. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection was diagnosed by CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The range of quantification of this assay was 600\u2013100,000 copies/ml for CMV. CMV pneumonia was defined as the detection of ground glass opacity by chest X-ray film or computed tomography, the detection of CMV in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or lung tissue samples, and clinical signs such as fever, cough, dyspnoea and hypoxemia. The diagnosis of PJP was made clinically or by the identification of Pneumocystis from sputum, bronchoalveolar fluid, tracheal secretions or lung tissue by special stains or a non-nested PCR, specifically designed to diagnose pneumonia rather than colonization [18]. ARDS was defined as the acute onset of hypoxemia (arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen [PaO2/FIO2] \u2264 200 mmHg) with bilateral infiltrates on chest radiographs, without left atrial hypertension. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) was defined as the simultaneous failure of at least two organs. ESRD was defined as eGFR < 15 ml/min per 1.73m2 or requiring renal replacement treatment for > 3 months.",

A Mann-Whitney U test was used for nonparametric distributions. Chi-squared tests were used for the comparison of categorical data. To address the independent predictive value of factors associated with the rate of infections, the variables with P values of less than 0.1 in univariate analysis as well as those reported in the literature were selected for multivariate analysis using the Cox regression model. The group with corticosteroids only was used as a reference group in multivariate analysis. Only the time to first severe infection was evaluated. Laboratory values and BVAS used for modelling were from the time of diagnosis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine the cut-offs of SCr, haemoglobin, albumin, CD4+ T cells and BVAS. All tests were two-tailed, and P-values of < 0.05 were considered significant. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated at the 95% level.",
