These differences and similarities reflect the strategies that are used by these viruses to manipulate host cells, offering the opportunity to learn about the roles of host cell factors, pathways and the mechanisms of their manipulation by conducting comparative analyses. In this Review, we summarize the current understanding of how members of the Flaviviridae family take control of cellular components or processes in order to create environments that are favourable for viral replication. We will compare and contrast DENV and ZIKV with HCV as representatives of the Flavivirus and Hepacivirus genera, respectively. Understanding the details of how viruses exploit their host cells opens new avenues for the development of antiviral strategies, and comparing replication strategies within the Flaviviridae may help us to identify shared essential host-dependency factors that are suitable for the development of broad-spectrum antivirals with pan-flaviviral activity.",

These ROs serve to increase the local concentration of cellular and viral factors that are required for genome replication, coordinate the different steps of viral replication through their compartmentalization and to shield genomic RNA from cellular innate immune sensors. ROs can be grouped into two morphologically distinct classes designated as invaginated/spherule-type ROs or protrusion-type ROs. Invaginated/spherule-type ROs are generated by invaginations of the donor membrane into the organelle lumen. The protrusion-type ROs are composed of clusters of single-membrane vesicles (SMVs), double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), multimembrane vesicles (MMVs) and often multimembrane tubules. Interestingly, although donor membranes can be provided by different organelles, ROs from all (+) RNA viruses can be classified into one of these two morphotypes, suggesting evolutionarily conserved mechanisms of their biogenesis 8 .",

            "text": "The specific function of CMs in viral infection is still unclear. An enrichment for viral proteins but not dsRNA in these cellular structures suggests that CMs are sites of polyprotein maturation 12 . CMs could also serve as lipid storage sites or interfere with innate immune responses by disrupting the mitochondriaassociated membranes (MAMs), an important interface for innate immune signalling, or by sequestering innate immune pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) 9, 13, 14 . However, the absence of such structures in either DENV-infected mosquito cells 15 or ZIKV-infected hNPCs 10 questions a general function for CMs in viral replication and argues for a cell type-specific role. In addition to VPs and CMs, tightly juxtaposed ER cisternae with limited luminal area, termed zippered ER (zER) membranes, are often observed in ZIKV-infected hepatoma cells 10 . Interestingly, in hNPCs infected with The ORF encoding the dengue virus (DENV) (part a) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) (part b) polyprotein and the predicted secondary structures of the 5\u0374 and 3\u0374 non-translating regions (NTR) are depicted on the top of each panel. a | The DENV genome contains a type 1 cap structure at the 5\u0374 end. Polyprotein cleavage by cellular signal peptidases is indicated by scissors. Arrows denote the cleavage by the viral protease, whereas the black vertical arrow indicates cleavage by the Golgi apparatus-resident protease furin. The question mark denotes a DENV polyprotein cleavage performed by an unknown protease. The DENV structural proteins capsid protein C, prM and envelope protein E are constituents of the virion; NS1, the only non-structural protein residing in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and NS2A are essential for virus replication and production of infectious particles; serine protease subunit NS2B acts as a cofactor for serine protease NS3 and recruits NS3 to ER membranes; NS3 is a multifunctional protein with protease, nucleotide 5\u0374 triphosphatase (NTPase), RNA 5\u0374 triphosphatase and helicase activities; NS4A is an integral membrane protein with membrane curvature-inducing activity; the 2K peptide serves as a signal peptide for co-translational NS4B insertion into the ER membrane; NS4B is a protein with no reported enzymatic activity that interacts with NS3 and is absolutely required for virus replication; NS5 consists of an N-terminal domain that possesses guanylyltransferase, guanine-N7-methyltransferase and nucleoside-2\u0374-O-methyltransferase activities involved in 5\u0374-RNA capping and methylation of the viral genome, and a C-terminal domain with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity responsible for viral RNA synthesis. b | The HCV RNA genome is ~9.6 kb long, uncapped and flanked by highly structured 5\u0374 and 3\u0374 NTRs. The 5\u0374 NTR contains a type III internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that directs the cap-independent translation of the viral RNA genome. Polyprotein cleavage by the viral protease is indicated by arrows, whereas cleavage by cellular signal peptidases is indicated by scissors. The cleavage by the cellular signal peptide peptidase resulting in the removal of the HCV core carboxyterminal region is indicated by an asterisk. The core protein and the envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 constitute the viral particle, whereas p7 and NS2 support particle assembly yet are not incorporated into virions; the NS2 C-terminal domain contains a cysteine protease that catalyses the cleavage of the NS2-NS3 junction; NS3 contains serine protease, RNA helicase and NTPase activities; NS4A acts as cofactor for the NS3 protease and anchors NS3 to ER membranes; NS4B is involved in the formation of the HCV replication organelle; NS5A is a phosphoprotein with an intrinsically unfolded C-terminal region that mediates interactions with numerous cellular proteins; NS5B is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase responsible for RNA synthesis. Note that only the DENV capsid and NS1 as well as HCV NS5A are shown as dimers, but additional viral proteins form homodimers and heterodimers or oligomeric complexes. AUG, methionine (start codon); D1, domain 1. Part b is adapted from REF. 39 ZIKV, neither CMs nor zERs are formed, and the average diameter of VPs is considerably smaller (~60 nm versus ~90 nm in hepatoma cells), suggesting that cell type-specific factors help determine the architecture of ZIKV ROs.",

The released positive-sense RNA ((+)RNA) is recognized by ribosomes, initiating translation at the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and producing a single polyprotein. Viral and cellular proteases catalyse the co-translational and post-translational cleavage of the polyprotein into three structural and seven non-structural proteins, almost all of which are associated with intracellular membranes (see the figure) . Whereas the structural proteins are constituents of the virion, the non-structural proteins orchestrate ER membrane invaginations, which are the presumed site of RNA genome amplification via the synthesis of a negative-sense RNA ((\u2212)RNA) intermediate. All Flavivirus non-structural proteins are essential for RNA replication, with DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) having a dual role in RNA replication and virus particle production 161 . The (+)RNA molecules that are generated by the viral replicase complex can be incorporated into viral particles, a process involving RNA encapsidation and budding into the lumen of the ER, which occurs predominantly in regions opposite to the replication sites 9 . Maturation of nascent DENV particles containing prM occurs along the secretory pathway by furin-mediated cleavage of prM 162 .

            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) particles are closely associated with host cell lipoproteins and have a high lipid content. These lipoviroparticles primarily target hepatocytes and enter cells through stepwise binding to several host cell receptors that eventually localize viral particles to tight junctions where they are internalized (see the figure) . In this case, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) together with low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs) and other cell surface molecules mediate the initial binding to the cell. Viral particles then interact with the scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SRB1) and the tetraspanin CD81, which guide the lateral diffusion of bound virions towards the apical membrane. There, CD81 associates with the tight junction proteins claudin 1 (CLDN1) and occludin (OCLN), a step that is critical for endocytic internalization via the clathrin-dependent entry pathway. After release of the viral RNA into the cytosol, the viral genome is translated at the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and viral proteins together with host cell factors form the replication organelle, which is composed primarily of doublemembrane vesicles (DMVs), a fraction of which remain open towards the cytosol. DMVs either remain linked to the ER or are released. HCV particle assembly occurs in close association with cytosolic lipid droplets at sites most likely enriched in core protein; envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2; p7 and non-structural protein 2 (NS2) 163 . Formation and possibly also secretion of newly formed virions occur in association with components of the very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) machinery. Secreted HCV particles exhibit an unusually low buoyant density (\u22641.055 g/ml in serum and ~1.1 g/ml in cell culture), are highly pleomorphic, incorporate cellular lipoproteins (most notably apolipoprotein E (APOE)) and have a lipid composition resembling low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles (reviewed in REF. 119 ). APOE might be acquired during or after envelopment of HCV particles and contribute to particle maturation, particle release or acquisition of infectivity 164 . Interestingly, APOE, the secreted glycoprotein E RNS of pestiviruses and NS1 of flaviviruses were reported to fulfil the same function in virus maturation and can even rescue infectivity of HCV particles that are produced in APOB-APOE double knockout cells 165 . Most recent morphological and biochemical analyses have shown that HCV forms lipoviroparticles (that is, particles resembling VLDL) 166 but can also bind to VLDL particles after release from cells, thus forming particle complexes 167, 168 . Progeny HCV virions are presumed to exit the cell via secretory pathways.

However, it is not yet possible to unambiguously localize the site of de novo RNA synthesis to either the lumen or to the outer membrane of DMVs. Biochemical studies have showed that HCV RNA and replicase activity reside within a nucleaseresistant and protease-resistant environment [18] [19] [20] , supporting the hypothesis that replication occurs within the membrane-protected luminal side of DMVs. Exchange of metabolites and factors that are required for replication, as well as the exit of newly synthesized genomes from DMVs, could occur through pore-like openings, which were observed in ~10% of the vesicles. This would suggest that only a minor proportion of the DMVs supports active replication at a given time point and that replication might cease when membrane openings are closed 16 . Alternatively, proteinaceous transport complexes, such as nuclear pore complex-like structures, might enable traffic in and out of a closed membrane compartment 21, 22 .",

Both proteins possess multiple transmembrane spanning \u03b1-helices and a single amphipathic \u03b1-helix that is partially embedded into the luminal leaflet of the ER 8 (FIGS 1a,2A). The lipid bilayer asymmetry that is produced by the \u03b1-helix insertion might act as a wedge and induce negative membrane curvature. Moreover, membrane bending might be increased by the formation of NS4A and NS4B homo-oligomers and hetero-oligomers 23 . However, the individual or combined expression of NS4A and NS4B outside the context of viral infection does not induce the formation of VPs, suggesting that the membrane remodelling functions of these proteins are not sufficient to phenocopy DENV ROs and that additional viral factors are required. Owing to its analogy to alpha viruses and the Flock House virus, viral RNA could be one candidate factor [24] [25] [26] .",

The complex topology of NS4B, which is comprised of four transmembrane \u03b1-helices flanked by two amphipathic \u03b1-helices on either side (FIG. 1b) , together with its oligomerization capabilities, may support and promote positive membrane curvature 32 . Moreover, essential residues for DMV formation and RNA replication have been identified within the NS4B carboxy-terminal domain 33 . Regarding NS5A, it is the only HCV protein able to induce DMVs 16 , a process that is facilitated by determinants that are located within the membrane-associated amino-terminal amphipathic \u03b1-helix of NS5A domain 1 (REF. 31 ). Furthermore, NS5A recruits several host factors that are essential for membranous web formation [34] [35] [36] .

High levels of viral RNA and proteins in infected cells causes increased cellular stress, leading to the activation of cellular pathways that mitigate stress and promote cell survival or trigger apoptosis (FIG. 3A) . The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a pathway aimed at compensating for increases in ER stress by increasing the ER protein-folding capacity, attenuating mRNA production and stimulating the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of misfolded proteins. Initiation of the UPR is facilitated by the interaction of immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (BiP) with one of three ER sensors: serine/threonineprotein kinase/endoribonuclease (IRE1), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-\u03b1 kinase 3 (PERK; also known as EIF2AK3) and cyclic AMP-dependent transcription factor ATF6-\u03b1 (ATF6) 60 . Additionally, UPR activation leads to increased autophagy, oxidative stress and stress granule formation and has been linked to the potentiation of antiviral inflammatory responses [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] . If these mechanisms are not effective at restoring ER homeostasis, active UPR pathways lead to apoptosis.",

For DENV infection, a time-dependent induction of each UPR pathway has been reported 71 . At early stages of infection, the PERK pathway is activated, leading to a translational block through the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit 1 (eIF2\u03b1), an event that also leads to the production of cytoplasmic stress granules 71, 72 . DENV overcomes this block and antagonizes stress granule formation by reversing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, presumably through the activation of the negative feedback factor protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 15A (GADD34; also known as PPP1R15A) (REFS 71, 73) . Interestingly, a recent report demonstrated that DENV potentiates a host cell translational block by stimulating eIF4E phosphorylation, which in turn limits cap-dependent translation 72 . This translational repression did not decrease viral protein synthesis, supporting a model in which DENV can switch between cap-dependent and cap-independent translation during infection 72, 74 .",

XBP1 is then translocated to the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor, facilitating the activation of the ERAD pathways and stimulating expansion of the ER membrane, both of which help to alleviate DENVinduced ER stress 77, 78 . DENV has developed mechanisms to block the downstream apoptotic mediators of the IRE1 pathway, thereby taking advantage of the prosurvival properties of this pathway to enhance viral replication (reviewed in REF. 70 ). Whereas the IRE1 pathway is also activated by HCV infection and might have a proviral function, mainly through the induction of autophagy (see below), in the case of DENV IRE1-mediated XBP1, activation causes membrane expansion that is important for viral replication and is possibly involved in the formation of VPs.",

Although a strong dependence on the UPS was not observed for HCV infection 48, 89 , several UPS components are required for efficient viral replication 90 . Interestingly, UPS components of relevance for HCV replication are also required for WNV and DENV replication 90 , suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role in the replication cycles of members of Flaviviridae. UPS-mediated viral protein degradation can also restrict viral replication and enhance an adaptive antiviral immune response by increasing the presentation of antigenic peptides to cytotoxic T cells. By contrast, HCV exploits UPS-mediated protein degradation to alter the stoichiometry of viral proteins. For instance, it has been reported that the viral NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is rapidly degraded to prevent possible interference with genome packaging 91 . The proteasome also regulates HCV core stability via ubiquitin-dependent and ubiquitin-independent mechanisms, thus restricting or enhancing HCV particle production, respectively. Finally, all Flaviviridae family members induce proteasomal degradation of specific restriction factors as well as innate signalling components such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) (in the case of DENV and ZIKV) or signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 and 3 (STAT1 and STAT3, respectively) (in the case of HCV) [92] [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] [98] [99] (FIG. 3B) .",

            "text": "Autophagy. Autophagy is a catabolic process involving the formation of DMVs (autophagosomes) that engulf cytoplasmic content, cellular organelles, protein aggregates and pathogens for lysosomal degradation. Increased formation of autophagosomes and modulation of the autophagic flux has been consistently observed in DENV, ZIKV and HCV-infected cells 100, 101 (FIG. 3B) . For flaviviruses, autophagy induction is mediated by NS4A for DENV and NS4A in addition to NS4B for ZIKV [102] [103] [104] (FIG. 3B) . In contrast to DENV, where NS4A-induced autophagy confers protection from cell death, ZIKV proteins dysregulate autophagy through AKT1-mTOR (RAC-\u03b1 serine/threonine-protein kinase-mechanistic target of rapamycin) inhibition, leading to increased cell death and altered neurogenesis in fetal neural stem cells. For DENV, infectious vesicles containing viral RNA and autophagy markers were detected in supernatants of infected cells and in patient sera, supporting a role for autophagy as an alternative viral transmission route 105 . For both flaviviruses and HCV, viral proteins and RNA were found to colocalize with autophagosomes, suggesting that viral ROs associate with autophagic membranes 106, 107 . Whereas the ER origin of flavivirus ROs refutes this hypothesis, an involvement of autophagic factors in the formation of the HCV-induced membranous web was recently reported 9,108 . This study showed that the autophagosome membrane elongation complex ATG5-ATG12-ATG16L1 was recruited to the membranous web, potentially through an interaction between ATG5 and NS4B (REFS 108,109) (FIG. 3B) . Knockdown of either ubiquitin-like modifier-activating enzyme ATG7 or ubiquitin-like protein ATG12 expression produced aberrant membranous web structures and reduced viral replication, suggesting that this complex contributes to the formation of HCV ROs. For HCV, autophagy has been suggested to function during the early stages of virus infection, such as translation of incoming HCV RNA or formation of the membranous web 110, 111 . Additionally, recent reports indicate roles for autophagy in HCV particle secretion and the release of exosomes, which contain viral RNA fragments and infectious full-length HCV genomes 112, 113 .",

            "text": "Flaviviridae replication occurs in strict association with cellular membranes, and members within this virus family have developed the ability to modify the lipid composition of membranes at replication and assembly sites (reviewed in REFS 119, 120) . These lipid alterations presumably change the physical properties of membranes, such as permeability, fluidity and bending capacity. Several studies highlight the importance of lipid biosynthetic pathways in Flavivirus and Hepacivirus replication (FIG. 3C) . For instance, DENV, WNV and HCV replication is highly sensitive to depletion or pharmacological inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase (FASN) 120, 121 , which are key enzymes in the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway. Indeed, DENV NS3 and HCV NS5B proteins were shown to interact with FASN and mediate its recruitment to the vicinity of viral replication sites, where it likely promotes the local synthesis of fatty acids that are required for efficient virus replication or, alternatively, enhances the catalytic activity of the NS5B polymerase in the case of HCV 119 . In addition to fatty acids, cholesterol biosynthesis also appears to be required for Flaviviridae virus replication. Inhibitors of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), a rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic mevalonate pathway, decreases DENV replication in primary human monocytes and cultured cell lines 120 . It was observed that DENV infection increases the activity of HMGCR through the inactivation of 5\u0374 AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), resulting in higher levels of cholesterol in the ER and increased viral replication 122 (FIG. 3C) . Consistent with this, treatment with AMPK inhibitors was shown to exert a proviral effect. However, a recent report suggests that DENV infection transiently stimulates AMPK phosphorylation, leading to the inactiation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and induction of lipophagy 117 . In this study, pharmacological inhibition of AMPK was found to be antiviral. The reasons behind these conflicting results are currently unknown but may relate to the experimental conditions that were used or a cell type-dependent effect.",

Additionally, the ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX3X interacts with the HCV 3\u0374 UTR and activates the innate immunity regulator inhibitor of nuclear factor-\u03baB kinase subunit-\u03b1 (IKK\u03b1), which in turn induces the expression of SREBP through CREB-binding protein-histone acetyltransferase p300 (CBP-p300)dependent gene induction 119, 123 (FIG. 3C) . Alterations in the lipid profile of infected cells were also uncovered by high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis of DENV, WNV or HCV-infected cells [124] [125] [126] . These studies revealed that changes in the lipid composition were especially pronounced in membrane fractions that were enriched in viral ROs, where the content of phospholipids, glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids (mainly ceramide) was increased [124] [125] [126] . Interestingly, although DENV and HCV promote an overall increase in cellular phosphatidylcholine content, only HCV seems to induce the accumulation of this lipid in the perinuclear ER membrane where NS5A is present 124, 126, 127 . In addition, purification of HCV DMVs revealed cholesterol enrichment, which is otherwise present at low levels in the ER of uninfected cells 18 . It was found that different cholesterol transport proteins, such as the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) and the Niemann-Pick C1 protein (NPC1), participate in this cholesterol enrichment and are selectively exploited by HCV but not DENV 128, 129 . Overall, these findings support the concept that hepaciviruses and flaviviruses alter the local lipid composition of the ER to promote their replication.",

Reduction of PtdIns4P levels, either through gene PI4KA silencing or pharmacological inhibition, results in the formation of smaller and aggregated DMVs and a consequent reduction in virus replication 35 . PtdIns4P is required to promote the accumulation of cholesterol at viral replication sites through a non-vesicular cholesterol transport mechanism involving OSBP 128 (FIG. 3C, inset) . Importantly, PtdIns4P and OSBP activity are required for the formation of the HCV membranous web but are dispensable for DENV replication, highlighting differences between the two virus genera 35, 128 . In the case of HCV, it has been shown that PI4K\u03b1 is recruited by NS5A and NS5B to DMVs, where the kinase is activated to produce high amounts of PtdIns4P locally. It is assumed that PtdIns4P is used to facilitate the release of cholesterol from OSBP, which is discharged from the protein in exchange for PtdIns4P (reviewed in REF. 8) . A similar mechanism might operate for the enrichment of glycosphingolipids in DMV membranes via pleckstrin homology domain-containing family A member 8 (FAPP2) 131 (FIG. 3C) .",

Second, recent reports have proposed that the nuclear transport machinery has a cytoplasmic role in protecting HCV RNA from being sensed by PRRs.

Flaviviridae family members interact with mitochondria and MAMs to either potentiate or mitigate these mitochondria-associated processes 13, 149, 150 . Reports on the impact of flaviviruses, particularly DENV, on mitochondrial structure and function are still somewhat contradictory. Two recent studies demonstrate that DENV or ZIKV infection antagonizes dynamin 1-like protein (DRP1) function, leading to mitochondrial elongation and a reduction in MAMs, which favours viral replication 14, 151 . This virus-induced mitochondrial elongation enhances respiration to increase virus replication, and the sequestration of MAMs in virus-induced CMs appears to contribute to attenuating innate immune activation (FIG. 4) . Moreover, the expression of DENV NS4B is sufficient to induce mitochondrial elongation. In contrast to these findings, two other studies have reported DENV-induced mitochondrial fragmentation that is mediated by mitofusin degradation 152, 153 . These studies suggest a mechanism similar to HCV in which virus-induced mitochondrial fission inhibits apoptosis and alleviates immune activation 118, 154 . The differences between these reported observations could arise from differences in experimental setup or host cells that were used for infection. However, in both cases, it is clear that mitochondrial morphodynamics have an important role in Flavivirus infection.",

A GTPase of the dynamin superfamily that mediate mitochondrial outer membrane fission events. many pathways, creating an environment that is permissive to virus propagation. Considerable advances have been made in this area that have provided new and important insights into various aspects of the cell biology of virus infection, such as the discovery of a novel pathway to induce the expression of genes that are required for lipid biosynthesis 119, 123 , the identification of new protein folds as illustrated by the three-dimensional structure of DENV NS1 27 or novel insights into the mechanisms underlying virus-induced neuropatho genesis 7 . Moreover, comparative analyses of flaviviruses and hepaciviruses as reviewed here will help us to understand the evolutionary relationship between virus genera. For instance, the biogenesis and three-dimensional structures of the membranous ROs of flaviviruses are more similar to those of alphaviruses and nodaviruses, whereas the ROs of HCV resemble more those of picorna viruses and coronaviruses (reviewed in REF. 156 ). This probably reflects the differential use of distinct lipid synthesis and transfer pathways, which offers an interesting yet challenging alternative for the analysis of virus evolution that so far is primarily based on algorithms comparing nucleotide or amino acid sequence similarities.",

Although studies in more physio logically relevant systems are required to demonstrate the suitability of these targets for therapeutic approaches, the results per se have revealed surprising new insights into the cell biology of these cellular machines. For instance, an individual subunit of the signal peptidase complex can be eliminated without overt cytotoxicity in vitro while blocking virus replication, arguing that an approach that targets this subunit could have strong antiviral effects with low cytotoxicity 44 . In light of these results, we can expect that additional fundamental discoveries in cell biology will continue to be made while enhancing our understanding of virus replication and pathogenesis. This knowledge may provide insights into how the balance could be tipped in a direction that promotes the activation of pathways that are aimed at limiting virus replication or spread, with the ultimate goal of developing broad-spectrum antivirals.",
