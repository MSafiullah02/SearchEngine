Using isotope red cell tagging, it has been shown that red cell life span averages about 1/2 to 1/3 of normal in uremia. In addition, uremic erythrocytes have been found to be less deformable and osmotically more fragile when compared to their normal counterparts. Transfusion of uremic erythrocytes into an individual with normal renal function will restore the life span of those cells to normal. On the other hand, normal erythrocytes transfused into a uremic individual will have shortened survival. In the past, chronic hemolysis in maintenance dialysis patients may have manifested as increased blood transfusion require-ments. However, these days such hemolysis probably more often presents itself as erythropoietin resistance (larger erythropoietin doses being required for a given therapeutic response). A variety of abnormalities (such as impairment of red cell enzymatic activities and reduced synthesis of Na+ - K+ pump units by uremic reticulocytes) have been suggested to be the causes for the heightened predisposition of uremic erythrocytes to hemolysis.",

Hemolysis in the former is often the result of water-borne toxins, centralized dialysis equipment failure, or blood tubing defects\u2014whereas in the latter it results from medication or possibly inadequate dialytic therapy.

Unfortunately, chlorine can react with other compounds in water to form undesirable byproducts (such as trihalomethanes). A growing practice is to combine chlorine and ammonia to form chloramine (a compound containing NCl groups and produced by the attachment of chlorine to nitrogen) and to use this chemical as an alternative bactericidal compound. Despite being much less reactive than chlorine, chloramine has been found to cause hemolysis outbreaks among dialysis patients in various parts of the world.

Chloramine is ordinarily removed by passage through carbon filters. Often such passage is adequate to prevent chloramine-induced hemolysis. However, if the chloramine-contaminated water is pumped through a carbon filter too forcefully the elevated water pressure generated can create artificial channels within the device\u2014thus allowing the passage of chloramine-contaminated water into the dialysate. In addition, traditional carbon filters may not have enough capacity to prevent hemolysis when tap water chloramine concentrations are inordinately high\u2014as in the case of drought. An alternative method of removing chloramine from dialysate is to enrich the latter with ascorbic acid. However, serum ascorbic acid levels should be monitored to prevent hypervitaminosis C and secondary hyper-oxalosis. This ascorbic acid approach has not been widely adopted.",

It can also result from dialyzing against hypo-osmolal dialysates, as a result of using a faulty conductivity-measuring device. For instance, in 1994 (in a dialysis center) human error caused a central dialysate delivery machine to be switched to the \u201crinse and water\u201d mode instead of being directed to the \u201cdialysate\u201d mode.

This scenario most often occurs when the delivery of blood through the \u201carterial\u201d needle is inadequate, as in the case of access stenosis. Kinking can be the result of the improper manner in which blood tubing is routed over a hard and narrow support, especially if easily collapsible tubing is used. Hemolysis asso-ciated with blood path problems is mainly intravascular in nature. However, milder stimuli may lead to less significant damage to red blood cells\u2014causing them to be removed subsequently by the reticuloendothelial system (extravascular hemolysis).",
