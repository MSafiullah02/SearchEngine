These studies are case control, population based, and prospective, but in all cases the evidence for sensitization comes from measurement of IgE antibodies or immediate responses to skin testing. Although the implication of these studies is that allergen entering the lungs plays an important role in lung inflammation, only a minority of studies show a clear dose response between exposure and asthma symptoms. On the other hand, there are no studies showing a relationship between inhaled allergens and asthma in nonallergic individuals. The most likely explanation of dose-response data (i.e., lack of simple dose response to relationship) comes from (1) the effect of sensitization, (2) the inaccuracy of the measurements of allergen exposure, (3) differences between allergen sources, and (4) the fact that most acute episodes, and probably most episodes of wheezing, are triggered by one of the many nonspecific factors that can contribute to symptoms (Fig. 54-1\n).BOX 54-1Hill's Criteria for Causality and the Evidence Supporting a Causal Link between Mite Allergen Exposure of a Sensitive Person and the Development of Asthma\n1.The strength of the association is large and has been supported by:A.Population studiesB.Control studiesC.Prospective studies\n2.Repeated observations in different populations have consistent findings: Europe, United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan.3.A cause leads to a specific effect: asthma is the only lung disease that has been associated with sensitivity to inhalant allergens.4.A cause precedes an effect.5.There is a dose-response gradient: good evidence for dust mite and cockroach allergens.6.There is experimental evidence from:A.Avoidance studiesB.Challenge studies\n7.The mechanism is biologically plausible.\n",

However, there are only a few that are common enough to play a role in epidemiologic studies, and most of these are either perennial indoor allergens or have a long season (Table 54-1\n). The first studies used \u201chouse dust\u201d to skin test, but because it was impossible to define what was in the extract, it was difficult to take the results seriously.13 The discovery or definition of house dust mites was a critical event in understanding the pathogenesis of asthma. Voorhorst and Spieksmah identified Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus in dust and developed skin test reagents. It rapidly became obvious that dust mites were an extraordinarily important cause of sensitization in all countries where the humidity was high enough to support their growth.9,\n14 The reasons why dust mites are so important are still not clear. It could reflect their presence in bedding; the nature of the particles that become airborne; the biochemical/immunologic nature of the allergens; or some other factor present in the particles (e.g., endotoxin).15,\n16\n",

Sensitization to fungi is also observed in children with asthma.

Inhalation of dust mite and cockroach allergens is thought to be largely in the patients' house. For many years it was assumed that all significant exposure to the indoor allergens occurred at home. This concept has had to be revised, because it is now clear that significant exposure to cat and mite allergens can and does occur outside the child's home. For cat and dog, significant allergen is present in schools and also most houses that do not have a cat. Furthermore, there is extensive evidence that the quantities found away from animals are sufficient to sensitize.19,\n20 Indeed, in a recent study, 80% of the children who were skin test positive to cat allergen had never lived in a house with a cat. The message is that preventing primary exposure to animal dander is not possible. Dust mite allergens are not widely distributed away from the sites of mite growth, but children may get high exposure in daycare centers or in Granny's house.21 The effects of exposure to mite outside the child's house for a week or two, or of exposure in daycare 3 days a week, are not known. However, one explanation of the lack of success of primary avoidance studies is that sensitization can occur outside the house. Some of the recent studies suggest that avoidance measures at home can prevent the lung effects of sensitization even if they cannot prevent sensitization.21\n",

In many cases the proteins show sequence homology with other proteins that have a defined function (e.g., proteinases, transport proteins, and profilins).24,\n25 It is important to remember that sequence homology does not define function: enzymic activity in particular can be completely lost with minor changes in structure.26 On the other hand, the mite allergen Der p1 is a cysteine protease, and can act on many proteins including CD-25 and CD-23.25 Although this protein can cleave biologically relevant surface antigens and can open up tight junctions in vitro, it is much more difficult to establish that these activities are relevant to its allergenicity.24 Certainly, enzymic activity is not a necessary property of allergens since many major allergens are not enzymes (e.g., Fel d 1, Der p 2, Bla g 2). The recent evidence about mechanisms of tolerance to cat allergens suggest that the structure of the allergen is significant. However, it is not clear whether this reflects the primary structure, the tertiary structure, or the biologic properties of the allergens. The allergen proteins do have some physical properties in common. In particular, the molecular weight is generally between 15 and 40 kd. In addition, the proteins are almost all freely soluble in aqueous solution and are antigenically foreign. Thus, the simple view had been that all proteins that were soluble and were inhaled could give rise to an IgE antibody response in children and thus could become an allergen. In the past 5 years it has become clear that all allergens are not \u201ccreated equal.\u201d",

Most areas have regular counts of pollen grains and mold spores reported to the public. By contrast, the particles on which mite, cat, dog, and cockroach allergens become airborne cannot be reliably identified microscopically (Fig. 54-2\n). Because of this, the science of indoor allergens is dependent on sensitive assays for the major allergens (see Table 54-1). The situation is made more difficult because the particles that have been defined for two of the major indoor allergens are only airborne transiently after disturbance. Airborne behavior, particle size, and allergen content have been estimated for many allergens (Table 54-2\n).",

For many inorganic particles, it is thought that deposition in the alveoli causes the maximum damage. By contrast, larger particles can reach the tracheobronchial tree. Here the situation is complex because the size of particles is inversely related to the proportion of the particles that enters the lungs; on the other hand, the quantity of allergen per particle increases by the cube of the diameter. Thus, although only 5% of particles of 20 \u03bcm in diameter enter the lungs, this may be a more effective method of delivering protein to the bronchi. For a particle of 1 \u03bcm, approximately 30% will enter the lungs, but the volume and thus the quantity of protein is only 0.05% of a particle of 20 \u03bcm. Thus, although mite fecal particles and pollen grains are large, they may be an effective method of delivering allergen to the lungs, particularly during quiet mouth breathing.",

Thus, 200 spores/m3 indoors may be more significant than 2000 spores/m3 outdoors. And, again, particle size may be important. Strikingly, Alternaria spores are larger than most other fungal spores and have been associated strongly with asthma in the Southwest and Midwest of the United States.17,\n18 Mold spores are different from pollen grains, mite fecal particles, cat dander, or cockroach debris in that they have a firm outer surface that is designed to resist desiccation. As a result, they do not release proteins rapidly. Indeed, some of the major allergens of Aspergillus are not expressed until the spores germinate. The importance of these differences in particles can be appreciated by comparing (1) mite fecal particles, (2) cat dander, and (3) Aspergillus spores (see Table 54-2).",

In northern Scandinavia, cat allergen is the most important cause of sensitization and there is virtually no sensitization to mites or cockroaches. Most of the children who become allergic to cats and become asthmatic have never lived in a house with a cat. In this environment, cat ownership leads to decreased allergy, decreased prevalence of asthma, and decreased incidence of asthma.32,\n36 By contrast, in an environment with high concentrations of mite allergen in most houses (i.e., the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, or southeastern United States), sensitization to dust mites dominates other forms of sensitization in childhood.4,\n6,\n27,\n31,\n37,\n38 As a result, the presence of a cat has no effect on the prevalence of asthma. In addition, the presence of a cat has no effect on the prevalence of sensitization to dust mite. Thus, cat exposure can induce a specific form of tolerance. The implications of this phenomenon go beyond the relevance of cats in the house:1.That allergens are distinct not only in their ability to sensitize but also in their ability to tolerize at high dose.2.That producing IgG and IgG4 antibodies to the cat allergen Fel d 1 does not create a risk for symptoms on exposure to cat allergen; this argues very strongly that IgE antibodies are essential for the response that gives rise to asthma (Fig. 54-3\n).3.That the effects of cat ownership cannot be ascribed to a nonspecific effect on sensitization or IgE antibody production, because cat ownership does not decrease IgE antibody to dust mites.\n",

Younger than 3 years, it is possible to identify one or more viruses in a very large proportion of children presenting with, or admitted to hospital with, acute episodes of asthma or bronchiolitis (Fig. 54-4\n). This includes not only respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, and coronavirus, but also rhinovirus and the newly described metapneumovirus.11,\n40 At this age, the symptomatic children are no more allergic than age-matched children without respiratory symptoms admitted to the same emergency room or hospital. Indeed, in one study the mean total IgE of children admitted to hospital was 8 IU/mL. Among children older than 2 (or 3) years, and also in young adults, the data are completely different because rhinovirus is the only virus that has been shown to be associated with acute episodes and the children are highly allergic.11,\n39,\n40 Indeed, the mean total IgE of children admitted to hospital for asthma 3 to 11 years of age was approximately 330 IU/mL, while the value for controls was approximately 35 IU/mL.

The evidence from emergency room studies is that when the children present, they have elevated peripheral blood and nasal eosinophils, as well as elevated exhaled nitric oxide and lower pH of exhaled condensates.7,\n10,\n11,\n40 All of these features can be induced to some degree with rhinovirus challenge of a nonsymptomatic asthmatic.10,\n41 These studies are done in children using the NIH definition of children (i.e., up to 21 years). However, what is striking is that the response to rhinovirus challenge is much more marked among asthmatics with total IgE of greater than 200 IU/mL.10 Rhinovirus challenge has been investigated experimentally for approximately 20 years, primarily in nonallergic or nonasthmatic individuals. The results are absolutely clear that this virus does not induce asthma in a nonasthmatic individual. Of course, the rhinovirus is primarily a pathogen of the nose and is an extremely unusual cause of pneumonia. Thus, there are two possible explanations. The first is that rhinovirus does enter the lungs sufficiently to cause increased symptoms and pathology in allergic individuals or second that events in the nose can trigger events in the lungs by a neurologic, cellular, or cytokine-mediated effect. The studies of Dr. Busse's group in Madison have established beyond doubt that a rhinovirus infection can alter response of the lungs to an allergen challenge.41,\n42 They have also argued that the virus can be identified in the lung using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.43 Surprisingly, repeated nasal allergen challenge prior to rhinovirus challenge did not increase either the severity of the \u201ccold\u201d or the lung response.44\n",

            "text": "There is little doubt that inflammation in the lungs contributes to asthma symptoms and to reversible changes in lung function. Indeed, it has been shown that prolonged allergen avoidance, or steroid treatment, can decrease inflammation of the lungs in parallel with improvement of asthma. Thus, both allergen avoidance and steroids can decrease symptoms, improve lung function, and decrease bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR). What is not clear is how much different elements of the predominantly allergen-induced inflammation contribute to BHR or changes in lung function. The most convincing association with symptoms is the presence of peripheral blood eosinophils and the presence of eosinophils in the nose. Given the evidence that eosinophil granule contents (e.g., major basic protein [MBP] or eosinophil cationic protein [ECP]) are toxic to bronchial epithelium, it seemed logical that eosinophils played a major role in the inflammation of asthma. Surprisingly, treatment with anti-interleukin-5 (anti-IL-5), which successfully reduced peripheral blood eosinophil counts, did not improve asthma symptoms.45 Considerable attention has been focused on the sequence of events that leads to deposition of collagen below the basement membrane in children with asthma. This and other changes have been associated with the term remodeling; however, this term should be avoided because it is widely misinterpreted. Remodeling has been used to imply (1) progressive decline in lung function; (2) collagen deposition, increase in goblet cells, and fibroblast activity; and (3) changes in the elasticity of the lung. Unfortunately, there are no clear studies that connect any of the inflammatory changes with decreases in lung function. Furthermore, there is little evidence that progressive decline in lung function is an important feature of asthma in childhood. In most studies those patients who present with lower than average lung function will maintain decreased lung function over long periods of time. In the Childhood Asthma Management Program study there was little evidence for decline in lung function over 4 years. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of inhaled steroids in controlling the disease that were highly significant did not result in any significant difference in lung function 1 month after stopping treatment. Thus, the evidence that inflammatory changes can lead to progressive changes in lung function is not clear, and the term remodeling should be avoided. On the other hand, the fact that inhaled steroids provide effective control for mild or moderate asthma argues strongly that inflammation plays an ongoing role in the symptoms. However, steroids have such a wide range of actions that their efficacy does not provide evidence about which part of the inflammatory response is relevant.",

However, to date the studies have all been conducted in allergic subjects. Thus, there are two questions: First, are the quantities of peptides reaching the lungs a realistic model of what could happen during natural exposure; and second, how do the T cells get to the lungs? Lymphocytes are recruited to sites of local \u201cinflammation\u201d following the presence of a foreign antigen. Thus, an attractive argument is that in children with IgE antibody, the local deposition of an allergen particle can trigger mast cell degranulation, which leads to the recruitment of a variety of cells, including lymphocytes. Most of these cells are short lived in the tissues. However, T cells recruited to the tissues may persist locally. The presence of T cells in the lungs of allergic patients could explain many features of the chronicity of asthma. However, the hypothesis is that these cells will only accumulate locally in children who already have immediate hypersensitivity.",

Thus, treatment with anti-IgE that binds the main epitopes on the epsilon heavy chain is not possible. However, antibodies to the site that binds to the receptor for IgE (Fc-\u025b-R1) will only bind IgE that is not bound to a mast cell or basophil. Treatment with monoclonal antibodies to IgE would seem to be a logical treatment for allergic disease. However, there are some reasons why it should not succeed. First, other monoclonal antibodies that are in use clinically act on cytokines or interleukins that are present in much smaller quantities. Second, the short half-life of IgE means that these antibodies pass rapidly through the circulation but remain for much longer periods (i.e., up to 6 weeks) on mast cells in the skin. Third, as discussed above, it seems likely that at least part of the inflammatory response in the lungs is mediated by T cells (i.e., not dependent on IgE antibodies). Given the potential problems, the success of anti-IgE treatment in clinical trials has been encouraging.48 Indeed, some children derive major benefit from this form of treatment. The implication is that IgE antibodies play a role in the persistence of inflammation and BHR in the lungs. This finding is not only significant clinically but also because it provides proof of the concept that IgE antibodies play a direct role in asthma.",

The mechanism of this response includes a cascade of leukotrienes, prostaglandins, cytokines, and chemokines. Many of these have been identified as potential targets for treatment. However, given the number of molecules identified, it has been difficult to establish their role in the lung response. Many different approaches have been used, including measurement of cytokines, in samples obtained from the lungs, gene expression studies, detailed studies in murine models, and the development of antagonists or monoclonal antibodies suitable for clinical trials. Ultimately, it is clinical trials that provide the most convincing evidence. Thus, the efficacy of leukotriene antagonists strongly supports a role for these molecules in asthma. The results of the studies with anti-IL-4 or IL-4 receptor antagonists have been positive in moderate to severe asthma but were unconvincing in mild persistent asthma. Some years ago, the results with antagonists for PAF were consistently negative. Several other targets have been investigated and abandoned by the pharmaceutical industry. The continuing success of corticosteroids either as a local or a systemic drug may reflect the fact that they influence the expression of multiple genes as well as dramatically reducing circulating and tissue eosinophils. If, as seems obvious, corticosteroids are clinically effective because they have multiple actions, other agents may need to be combined (e.g., anti-IL-5 and an IL-4 antagonist).

It is well established that inhaling allergen in an allergen challenge can induce an eosinophil-rich cellular infiltrate and prolonged increases in nonspecific BHR.

However, the complexity of the relationship between allergens and asthma (see Fig. 54-1) would tend to obscure the dose response.

Many of the children who have early viral-induced episodes will go on to have persistent asthma. However, early episodes are common, and it is not clear whether the early infections influence the subsequent development of allergy or persistence of asthma. After age 3 years, the role of viral infections changes completely. Presumably, because of lung growth, viral infection of nonallergic children is no longer a cause of emergency room or hospital visits. At this age, the only virus that appears to play an important role is rhinovirus, and this effect is only seen in allergic children. More significantly, these children are not simply skin test positive, but they have major elevations of total serum IgE (geometric mean value for 53 children age 3\u201318 years was 390 IU/mL).11 This result is consistent with other studies and suggests that conditions that increase total IgE could be a risk factor for severe episodes of asthma.",
