Thus, the sensitivity of the VivaDiag COVID\u201019 IgM/IgG Rapid Test was 18.4%, specificity was 91.7%, while NPV was 26.2%, and PPV was 87.5% in patients enrolled from emergency room department. In contrast with the high levels of sensitivity reported in the previous study,\n6\n VivaDiag COVID\u201019 IgM/IgG Rapid Test revealed a very poor sensitivity (less than 20%). Indeed, the majority of patients that tested positive for COVID\u201019 by real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR would have been identified as negative using only the rapid serological assay, leading to a misdiagnosis of COVID\u201019 disease in the vast majority of patients.
