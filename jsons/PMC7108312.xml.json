            "text": "The human genome contains around 3 billion nucleotides that are tightly packed into 23 chromosomes in each haploid cell. These nucleotides regulate various cellular processes according to cell needs. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are genetic variations that are present in more than 1% of the population while genetic mutations are present in less than 1% of the population [1], [2], [3]. These genetic variations could occur in coding or non-coding regions of the DNA. The latter are important for disease association studies and genetic mapping. They also could still have an effect on transcription, splicing, regulatory non coding RNA or even mRNA degradation. Although some of these variants in coding regions are silent with no effect on proteins formed, the majority of other variants in the same coding regions could silence gene expression or produce a malfunctioning protein leading to genetic disorders. Several genetic variants, whether classified as mutations or polymorphisms, have been reported to be causative factors for various diseases such as cancer [4], [5], retinitis pigmentosa [6], [7], [8], sickle cell anemia [9], [10], and hearing impairment [11], [12], [13]. Early detection of these variants is inevitable to enable physicians to take all possible parameters that could ameliorate severity of various diseases, prevention of progression of associated complications and, if possible, starting early medication to save lives. This necessitates the development of innovative biosensing platforms that are inexpensive, specific, robust, time saving and affordable with multiplexing and high-throughput capabilities. These platforms should also be sensitive enough to detect minimal copy number that carries these genetic variations especially in very limited or precious samples. They also should precisely screen and genotype biological samples for low abundant contaminants such as microbes and viruses. Although next generation and the gold standard Sanger sequencing approaches have been used successfully for this purpose, various limitations have been reported in terms of being unaffordable, very expensive, challenging and time consuming [14], [15]. Several other affordable screening assays have been developed and used routinely for genotyping these variants. These assays include restriction fragment length polymorphism [9], [16], [17], real-time PCR [18], [19], TaqMan allelic discrimination assay [20], [21], single stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) [22], [23], [24], [25], heteroduplex analysis [6], [26], [27], dynamic allele-specific hybridization [28], [29], [30], single base extension [31], [32], [33], denaturing high performance liquid chromatography [34], [35], temperature gradient gel electrophoresis [36], [37] and Microarray platform [38], [39], [40], [41]. Most of those screening assays have drawbacks in specificity, sensitivity, cost effectiveness, multiplexing capability and/or time savings.",

Here in this article, traditional and recent modifications in LCR and ligation based amplifications are highlighted. Particular emphases on the recently integrated detection strategies such as nanoparticles (NP), quantum dots (QD), electrochemical and magnetic biosensors, DNAzyme, rolling circle amplification, strand displacement amplification, quartz crystal and leaky surface acoustic surface biosensors, surface enhanced raman scattering (SERS) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) are also detailed. Some of those integrated technologies have already been commercialized for real applications in various fields. Various genotyping assays for diverse genetic diseases, bacterial and viral pathogen detections are also discussed in this article.",

            "text": "LCR is a DNA dependent amplification that requires four oligonucleotides as primers [45]. Two oligonucleotides pair in close proximity with their complementary sequences on one template strand, whereas the other two oligonucleotides anneal with the second template strand in a similar way (Fig. 1\n). The resulting nick between adjacent oligonucleotides is covalently sealed by DNA ligase through a phosphodiester bond provided that the primer bases at the junction are perfectly matched with the target and hence one fragment will be generated for each template strand [45]. The formed ligated products serve as templates in subsequent cycles as in PCR. This leads to exponential amplification for the desired fragments [46]. In the presence of a single base change at the junction site, primers will not hybridize perfectly and hence no further amplification will occur. It is crucial to use DNA ligase that lacks blunt-end ligation activity, to prevent target independent ligation [47]. Ligation occurs through three main steps: (i) enzyme activation with either NADH or ATP [47], (ii) substrate adenylation, and (iii) nick-closure following nucleophilic attack. LCR is more sensitive and specific than gold standard PCR technique. It has been reported that the specificity and sensitivity for LCR, in presence of template DNA, were 100% and 97.6% respectively while for PCR they were 90% and 99.5% respectively [48]. Despite maximal specificity reported for LCR in comparison with PCR in the presence of template DNA, target independent ligation especially in the absence of template DNA remains one of the most limiting drawbacks that could occur at low frequency resulting in an increase in background signal with false positive results in some instances.",

            "text": "LDR is a modified LCR technique where only two oligonucleotides, instead of 4, bind adjacently on one target strand. LDR achieves linear amplification rather than exponential amplification as in LCR [49]. The effect of several additives on specificity and efficiency of LDR was studied. Unlike formamide, glycerol and DMSO, 5% PEG-6000 was reported to improve specificity without compromising efficiency [50]. LDR was used to screen for a low abundant single base mutation at codon 12 in the Kras oncogene using high resolving capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE)-Laser induced fluorescence (LIF) [51], [52]. Thomas et al. used three primers that have the same fluorophore at the 5\u2032 end but with varying length each corresponding to a particular genotype along with a common primer phosphorylated at the 5\u2032 end [51]. Hamada et al. used similar integrated technique but with a slight modification through the use of three fluorescently labeled discriminating primers with different nucleotides at 3\u2032end along with a conservative primer phosphorylated at 5\u2019end [52]. McNamara et al. developed PCR-LDR based assay for multiplex detection of human malaria infection caused by four parasite species [53]. In this study, five specific primers that vary in length by 3 nucleotides along with two fluorescently labeled conserved-sequence primers were used. Qi et al. used PCR-LDR assay for genotyping the MIR196A2 polymorphism in HBV and HCC Chinese patients [54]. Gerry et al. developed a universal DNA array platform combining PCR and LDR techniques with zip code hybridization for multiplex detection of low abundant mutations in Kras gene [55]. In this study, each allele specific primer was modified to contain a zip code sequence on its 5\u2032 end whereas the common primer was phosphorylated at 5\u2032 end with a fluorophore on its 3\u2032 end. This universal chip platform has also been microfabricated with polycarbonate and poly(methyl methacrylate) for the detection of K-ras oncogene SNPs [56]. Choi et al. reported a multiplex SNP genotyping assay consisting of multiplex PCR pre-amplification, ligation with DNA ligase and CE-fSSCP to increase resolving power for similar sized probes [57]. This assay was able to accurately discriminate SNPs in the tp53 gene.",

In each tube, two primers bind adjacently on the sense strand while the other two anneal with the antisense strand in a similar manner. Following multiple cycles of LCR, each adjacent pair in each tube will be sealed to form \u223c30-mer product. The two tubes are then mixed using fresh ligase and a new round of amplification is performed. After LCR amplification, full length product (\u223c 60-mer) will be formed only in presence of correct DNA target allele [58]. Nested LCR technique was reported to be more superior to LCR in terms of improved signal to noise ratio and also nonspecific binding reduction as the generated products, through primary LCR amplification, serve as primers in the secondary allele amplification.",

In G-LCR, four primers are designed to create a short gap of one to several bases between two adjacent probes (Fig. 2\na) hybridizing to each target strand [58], [59]. Thermostable DNA polymerase, lacking 3\u2032-5\u2032 proofreading and 5\u2032-3\u2032 nick translation exonuclease activities, and DNA ligase are then used to fill and seal this gap respectively. To improve specificity by minimizing target independent ligation process, an extension to the 3\u2032 end of the primer is added. It was reported that Gap-LCR can detect down to 10 target molecules in a reaction [59]. G-LCR was reported to be very specific and sensitive in detecting the G145R mutation in HBsAg [60]. Wei et al. demonstrated that GLCR was highly sensitive in detecting Chlamydia trachomatis in neonates with pneumonia [61]. Zhou et al. developed a DNAzyme based Gap-LCR assay that can detect SNPs through either colorimetric or fluorometric methods [62]. This assay was designed to amplify mutant allele of sickle cell anemia but not the wild type allele. A short functional G-quadruplex DNAzyme sequence was introduced into one of the LCR primers to be captured by anti-G sequence. Following normal steps in GLCR, lambda exonuclease and exonuclease III enzymes were used for digestion of unreacted probes and for the release of the embedded DNAzyme which forms G-quadruplex structure that ultimately binds hemin to confer a peroxidase like activity. Jenner et al. reported that G-LCR technique was efficiently able to detect the presence of as low as 1 mutant allele in one million wild type alleles for Kras gene codons 12 and 13 [63].",

After excitation of the reporter dye, the emitted fluorescence is transferred to the quencher dye resulting in subsequent fluorescence for the quencher dye. The rise in quencher fluorescence by increased cycle numbers is proportional to the starting DNA amount.

Asymmetric G-LCR (AGLCR) is a modification of gap-LCR to amplify and detect nucleotide changes in RNA molecule. This technique was developed by Marshal et al. (1994). Asymmetric GLCR involves the use of 3 or less nucleotides, instead of 4, in both cDNA and the gap-LCR steps (Fig. 3\n). Firstly, cDNA is synthesized from RNA by reverse transcriptase using only one primer and three dNTPs. Reverse transcription is terminated upon reaching the base that is not supplied in the reaction. Secondly, cDNA is denatured and then mixed with three probes, DNA polymerase and DNA ligase. The 3\u2032 end of the first probe is complementary to the 3\u2032 end of the synthesized cDNA strand and therefore hybridizes spontaneously. The second probe anneals to the 5\u2032 stretch of the first probe leaving no gap but a nick with the 3\u2032 end of the synthesized cDNA strand. The third probe is complementary to the 5\u2032 stretch of the synthesized DNA strand and therefore hybridizes spontaneously leaving a gap with the first probe. DNA polymerase starts filling the gap between probe one and three and the process terminates when the enzyme reaches the addition of the unsupplied nucleotide. The two nicks formed are then sealed by DNA ligase to form DNA hybridized complex that serve as a template for further GLCR amplification. Less than 50 copies of RNA transcripts could be detected using micro-particle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA) [45] and this method was reported to correlate with RNA-PCR and HCV antibody tests.",

This technique was developed by Demchinskaya et al. This approach involves careful design of two primers that harbor extra penta-nucleotide sequence on their 5\u2019end not to be complementary with the temple. Cleavase, an endonuclease enzyme, is then used to precisely cut the non-complementary 5\u2032 extension on the two primers. The other two primers bear additional nucleotides at their 3\u2019end to replace the cleavage removed nucleotides allowing perfect sealing with DNA ligase. The two primers harboring non complementary extra stretch on their 5\u2032 end also contain biotin and UP region at their 3 \u2018ends to bind streptavidin coated on a microwell plate and to enable colorimetric detection respectively. Although this approach prevents target independent ligation observed in conventional LCR, the produced signal is slightly decreased and the minimal limit for target DNA is 30 amol [67].",

This technique is extensively used as it is very simple, robust and can amplify multiple targets in one reaction using one primer pair following ligation step. Briefly, two oligonucleotide probes that bind adjacently on a target sequence are ligated only in presence of their complementary target DNA. One oligonucleotide probe is designed to contain a recognition sequence for forward universal primer on its 5\u2032 end while the other probe contains the reverse universal primer recognition sequence on its 3\u2032end (Fig. 4\n). In addition one of those probes contains a stuffer sequence that can be tailored with variable lengths to be assigned for each target for multiplexing purposes using one reaction. A fluorescently labeled universal forward primer is then used to generate up to 50 amplicons that can be visualized by capillary electrophoresis. This assay has been used routinely for the detection and quantitation of DNA copy number variation, relative ploidy, mRNA profiling, SNP detection, chromosomal aberration, methylation changes and transgene genotyping [68], [69], [70], [71]. Wang et al. developed a similar approach with replacement of stuffer sequences with unique zip codes. PCR amplification is performed with unlabelled universal primers and Cy5-labeled dCTP nucleotides. Cy5-labelled amplicons are then captured on microarray chip through hybridization with their complementary sequences of chip immobilized probes [72]. Sanchez et al. utilized the same method for profiling tumour markers using unique barcode sequences that are then captured by their complementary sequences that are immobilized on inexpensive electrode microarray. Detection is enabled through the use of horse-radish peroxidase (HRP) labelled secondary probes that are complementary to universal primer sequence. Besides cost reduction and high specificity reported for this assay, sensitivity limit was as low as 25pM [73]. The high success rate for MLPA in multiplex SNP genotyping led to the development of several other MLPA versions for other applications. Methylation specific-MLPA (MS-MLPA) and reverse transcriptase-MLPA (RT-MLPA) were developed for DNA Methylation profiling, gene copy number determination and genetic expression analysis.",

A flow cytometric device is used to identify each bead to measure fluorescence intensity for each bead-probe complex. Also the reverse primer, instead of the forward primer, is fluorescently labelled. If the target is not present, no fluorescence will be generated from the microsphere as no ligation would occur [74], [75]. The MOL-PCR assay was designed for multiplex detection of various targets and for SNP genotyping [74]. This technology has been applied for the multiplex detection of 15 genetically distinct plant pathogens including Citrus tristeza virus (CTV), Xanthomonas genus and Xylella fastidiosa. Mol-PCR has also been used in the detection of pathogens along with antibiotic (doxycycline and ciprofloxacin) resistance in Yersinia pestis, F. tularensis and Bacillus anthracis\n[74], [75]. The detection limit for this flow cytometry approach is estimated to be less than 103 molecules [74]. Mol-PCR has also been useful in identification and differentiation of the six main human-associated lineages of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) with sensitivity approaching 99.2% [76]. In 2008, Bruse et al. made few improvements to MOL-PCR assays by using fewer beads and universal biotinylated oligonucleotides to reduce costs significantly but also maintaining accuracy [77]. The assay enables the detection of 50 SNPs per well in a 96 well plate. In addition to a common probe, two allele specific probes that are labelled at their 5\u2032 ends with specific tag each are used for each SNP. Following successful ligation, the 5\u2032-tag hybridizes with its complementary sequence that is linked to a unique FlexMAP microsphere whereas the common probe 3\u2032 end anneals with its complementary universal biotinylated oligonucleotides. Following hybridization with streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin (SAPE), generated fluorescence is developed and detected using flow cytometric analysis.",

The universal ASO and LSO linkers contain complementary sequences to ASO and LSO probes respectively. Universal ASO linker also contains a forward priming site for multiplex PCR purposes. Following ligation step, exonucleases are used to remove target DNA and unligated oligonucleotides and linkers. Following purification, multiplex PCR is performed using universal forward and biotinylated reverse primer. Biotinylated amplicons are then captured by streptavidin-coated microtiter plates. After washing step, fluorescently labelled universal Zip-Chute oligonucleotides hybridize to the biotinylated single-stranded products. Each Zip-Chute oligonucleotide contains complementary sequence to zipcode sequence on each ASO probe and also contains a mobility modifier for analytical tracking during CE. ZipChute oligonucleotides are then eluted and analysed using Applied Biosystems analyzer. This assay has been used extensively for SNP genotyping in various fields.

Following denaturation, HRP conjugated streptavidin (HRP-SA) bind biotinylated ligated product leading to precipitation of 3,3 diaminobenzidine in the presence of H2O2. The latter can then be detected through quartz crystal biosensor (QCM) as a cost effective mean with a detection limit of 0.1 nM. Zhang et al. used a similar approach, for the detection of K-ras SNP in codon 12, except for the replacement of HRP-SA with alkaline phosphatase streptavidin (ALP-SA). ALP converted ascorbic acid 2-phosphate to ascorbic acid which in turn reduced silver ions causing precipitation for silver metal on electrode surface and this was quantified using linear sweep voltammetry. The reported sensitivity for this assay was 80fM [83]. In 2011, Xu et al. reported a similar biosensor for the one developed by Feng et al. but with leaky surface acoustic wave (LSAW) biosensor instead of quartz crystal.

In this method, a padlock probe was first circularized upon hybridization with its complementary sequences on mutant strand through DNA ligase. DNA polymerase was then used to amplify the circularized padlock probe using primers complementary to the middle region of the padlock probe. Elongated products annealed with their complementary sequences on capture probes tethered to gold electrode. Detection of hybridized products was performed using methylene blue which produced current measured through altering current voltammetry (ACV) [85]. Su et al. utilized a similar technique except for the use of biotinylated primer to allow elongated products to be captured with streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads [86]. This method was reported to detect down to 2 amol mutated strands. Long et al. integrated hyperbranching RCA (HRCA) technology with electrochemiluminescence using paramagnetic beads for specific and sensitive identification of hly genes of Listeria monocytogenes. In this assay biotin as well as ruthenium labeled primers were used for generation of elongated products with a reported sensitivity as low as 10 aM [87]. Dong et al. developed a novel ligation based RCA technique with chemiluminescence imaging for SNP detection. In this assay, biotin labeled probes were immobilized on streptavidin coated 96 well plate and then allowed to anneal with target DNA. A second discriminating probe was ligated to immobilized probe through DNA ligase. The 3\u2032 end of the discriminating probe acted as a primer for circularized probe DNA to initiate RCA using Klenow exo- DNA polymerase. HRP-mimicking DNAzyme generated through the binding of hemin to elongated RCA products catalyzed the chemiluminescence reaction between H2O2 and luminal. This assay was reported to detect as low as 0.26 fM target DNA [88]. Cheng et al. integrated LCR with RCA for SNP detection. In this assay, one pair of primers along with a padlock probe (PLP) is used. Following ligation and repetitive cycles, exponential amplification of circular PLP (cPLP) and ligated products is achieved. RCA is then initiated with cPLP as a template and ligated product as a primer to produce several copies of long dsDNA products that are detected through binding with Syber Green I dye [89]. This assay is reported to be specific with a detection limit of 1fM of target DNA. He et al. integrated magnetic beads based RCA and gold nanoparticles tags for specific and sensitive SNP detection using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) detection strategy [90].

Thiolated capture probes and thiolated ethylene glycol were co-assembled on gold electrode to obtain mixed self assembled monolayer of ONS. The 3\u2032-end of the capture probe contains nucleotides that are complementary to the corresponding SNP target sequences (Fig. 6\n). The assay also used a signal probe containing sequences adjacent to the SNP nucleotide on its 5 end and a biotin at its 3\u2018end to enable detection. Following hybridization between target DNA and capture DNA based on full complementarity, the signal probe was then ligated, through DNA ligase, to the capture probe. Stringent denaturation and washing steps were carried out to remove target DNA and unligated signal probe. Covalently ligated signal probes that were not washed, were bound to avidin\u2013horseradish peroxidase conjugate to sequentially develop an amperometric signal.",

Briefly, two capture probes (CPs) coated AuNPs were prepared to hybridize adjacently on both target DNA and also on complementary partial probes at 50 \u00b0C (Fig. 7\n). Using ampligase, the nick site at the junction between target DNA and the CP coated AuNPs was ligated whereas the duplex formed between CP coated AuNPs and partial probes was not sealed. Temperature was then increased to 90 \u00b0C to denature all formed duplex structures. During subsequent hybridizations and ligations, exponential amplification of ligated CP coated AuNPs occured leading to formation of AuNP aggregates that changes colour from red to purple/gray. As low as 20 aM can be detected with 103 times enhanced specificity was reported in this assay. This assay has been implemented successfully for the detection of the oncogene Kras associated mutation. Two years later, Knez et al. replaced the colorimetric detection method with fiber optic surface plasmon resonance (FO-SPR) platform to improve sensitivity with real-time monitoring of the assay in a simplified way without the need for any further analysis following the reaction [93]. Yin et al. developed an ultrasensitive LCR based AuNPs biosensor for DNA detection [94]. This assay was similar to the one developed by Shen et al. except for the probe overloading process on AuNPs through employment of salt aging steps. Following subsequent cycles, exponential amplification of target DNA and increasing assembly of aggregated AuNPs were achieved. This method had much more improved sensitivity of 1.5 aM and could be measured either colorimetrically or by dynamic light scattering.",

Two pairs of complementary probes are used in this assay (Fig. 8\n). The first pair had similar sequences to the upstream sequence of the SNP site while the second pair had similar sequences to the downstream sequence of the SNP. For the first pair, only one probe had biotin on its 3\u2019end. For the second pair, the 3\u2032 end of one probe had G-quadruplex sequence while the 5\u2032-end of the other probe had fluorescein. At 50 \u00b0C, the biotin and the fluorescein labeled probes hybridize adjacently on target DNA and are then sealed by a thermostable ligase whereas the duplex formed for each pair of complementary probes cannot be ligated together. All formed duplexes are then denatured at 90 \u00b0C to release ligated product, target DNA and the 4 complementary probes. The ligated product is then used as a new template for the ligation of both the unlabelled probe and the G-quadruple containing probe. Exponential amplification of ligated products is achieved through subsequent cycles. The resultant products are then allowed to form duplexes through incubation at 37 \u00b0C. All biotinylated products are then immobilized on streptavidin-coated magnetic particles (SA-MPs) while all non-biotinylated products are removed during magnetic separation process. G-quadruplex containing biotinylated duplex intercalates hemin forming peroxidase-mimicking DNAzyme that catalyzes energy transfer from luminal-H2O2 to fluorescein. This assay has been implemented in the SNP genotyping of the K-ras (G12C) mutation. Exponential amplification along with the use of SA-MPs has significantly improved detection limit down to 0.86fM DNA without compromising specificity.",

In this assay, the hairpin probes immobilized on magnetic beads were opened and hybridized with target DNA through their 5\u2019end. A reporter probe, with a biotin label on its 5\u2019end, was used in this assay to be complementary to 5\u2019end of target DNA. The 3\u2032 end of the biotinylated probe is sealed with the 5\u2019end of immobilized probe through DNA ligase (Fig. 9\n). In the next step, Klenow fragment (exo\u2212) polymerase and short primer were added to synthesize a new strand that displaced target DNA. The latter initiated another cycle of hybridization with hairpin and biotinylated probes for signal amplification. Magnetic separation was then carried out followed by addition of HRP conjugated streptavidin to bind biotinylated products and to develop chemiluminescence signal through catalytic reaction of luminol- paraiodopenol-H2O2. If there is a mismatch, no ligation would take place and hence neither displacement nor a signal would be generated. Wang et al. developed a simple but sensitive and specific label free SNP genotyping assay based on ligase reaction. In this approach, allele discrimination is achieved through DNA ligase and then nickase based strand displacement amplification is utilized to generate huge amount of peroxidase-mimicking DNAzyme sequences against hemin to enable label-free chemiluminescence detection. This model has been tested successfully for SNP detection in cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP2C19*2 [97]. Xu et al. developed a novel ligation dependent SDA using tailored hairpin probes and an initiation primer. The first hairpin probe was labelled with fluorophore and quencher at both ends while the second hairpin probe had an extension that was complementary to initiation primer sequence. The two hairpin molecular beacons contained recognition sites for nickase cleavage. Following hybridization of target DNA and initiation primer with the two hairpin probes, DNA ligase seal the nick between the two opened hairpin probes. The 3\u2032 end of the initiation primer was then extended through polymerization to fill the gap with nick site formation and target recycling through displacement step. Detection was based on measuring fluorescence intensity generated through the opening of the labelled hairpin probe with resultant nicked trigger portion [98].",

Ligated products were then captured on poly (dT)-coated paramagnetic iron beads. After bead separation using magnetic field, the biotin moiety on the 5\u2032 end was bound to streptavidin-ALP conjugate for colorimetric detection [104]. Toubanaki et al. developed colorimetric biosensor assay for SNP genotyping based on ligation reaction [105]. In this assay one common upstream primer was labeled with biotin at the 5\u2032 end and another two allele specific primers were having poly (dA) tail at their 3\u2032 ends. The DNA biosensor was assembled on a plastic adhesive backing with dried oligo(dT)-conjugated gold nanoparticles. The poly dA tail of ligated product was bound to dT-conjugated gold nanoparticles while the other biotin end was captured by streptavidin. Accumulation of nanoparticles resulted in development of a red line after 30 min. Several other colorimetric assays have been developed using other strategies such as DNAzyme [62], [106], Cleavase enzyme [67], gold nanoparticles [42] and magnetic beads [107].",

Peng et al. combined LDR with FRET for the detection of bacterial pathogens. In this assay, the two LDR primers were designed to form a reverse molecular beacon following ligation process due to their high Tm values. Primers termini also contained donor and acceptor dyes to enable FRET once brought into close proximity through the formation of a molecular beacon [108]. Yuan et al. developed an integrated LCR-lambda exonuclease-assisted cationic conjugated polymer (CCP) biosensor for miRNA genotyping [109]. The ability of CCPs to harvest and amplify signal was used as a donor in the FRET transfer to fluorophore. In this assay, one primer was designed to have a phosphorothioate modification at its 3\u2032 end while the other primer was labeled with fluorescein at its 5\u2032 end. Following LCR, one ligated product was formed with fluorescein label on its 5\u2032 end and phosphorothioate on its 3\u2032 end. The latter was resistant to exonuclease I and exonuclease III degradation. Sun et al. developed a robust real-time based LCR for p53 SNP (Arg282Trp) genotyping [110]. In this assay, two probes were used. The first probe was labeled with a fluorophore while the second one was labeled with a quencher. In the presence of the target DNA, the two probes were ligated and the close proximity of the fluorophore and the quencher caused FRET with a decrease in the fluoresecent signal generated. This decrease in fluorescence is directly proportional to DNA target amount. The reported sensitivity for this assay was estimated to be as low as 10 aM.",

            "text": "Conventional LCR technique has been used routinely as an inexpensive and specific technique for detection of wide range of samples (Table 1\n) with 97.6% sensitivity [48], [49]. Samples are amplified exponentially and therefore this technique was suitable for detection of limited samples. Limitations in multiplexing potential and high-throughput along with high background signal due to target independent ligation, especially in absence of target DNA, were the main drawbacks for conventional LCR [48], [49], [154]. The conventional method requires a conventional thermal cycler with either an autoradiography, spectrophotometric or fluorometric detection method [99], [100], [101], [102], [103], [104], [110], [111]. Electrochemical detection was recently enabled with conventional LCR through the use of microdevices and a potentiostat with 3 electrode system [115], [116]. Nested LCR was developed to overcome the high background signal obtained in conventional LCR due to target independent ligation especially in the absence of target DNA [58]. This was achieved through amplification of each template strand separately prior to ligation reaction. Nested LCR is not common at all and is considered to be more expensive than conventional LCR as it requires more reagents and reactions. LDR is one of the most widely used versions of LCR that has overcome several drawbacks reported earlier on for conventional LCR [51], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57], [149], [150], [151], [152], [153], [154], [155]. In this technique, only two oligonucleotides are used for linear amplification of samples and this in turn preserves the ratio for the two alleles and also reduces background signal for target independent ligation. Various detection methods such as microarray, SERS, FRET, capillary electrophoresis and magnetic beads have been integrated with LDR for improved sensitivity, multiplexing potential and high-throughput applications [51], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57], [101], [105], [106], [107], [108], [119]. LDR can detect as low as 1 mutant allele in 1000 copies of wild type sample with a detection limit of 0.4-1fM [101], [106], [107].",

This version has diminished background signal attributed to target independent ligation with increased sensitivity (detection of one mutant allele in million copy of a wild type allele) and specificity compared to conventional LCR [46], [59], [60]. It is robust with high capability for high-throughput applications and has been commercialized by Abbott Diagnostics company as Abbott LCx\u00ae which was FDA approved since 1994 [62], [63]. It has been widely applied for detection of various microorganisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhea\n[49], [120], [121], [122], [123], [124], [125], [126], [127], [131]. The main disadvantage for this version is that it is not suitable for multiplexing applications due to false positive results obtained and therefore it was taken off the market in 2002 [63]. QGLCR is a real time quantitative version of GLCR. It is very robust and data is obtained after each amplification cycle with enhanced sensitivity, specificity and high-throughput applications [64], [65], [66]. It is relatively expensive as it requires a real time PCR machine to detect FRET from a fluorescent dye into a quencher and has limited applications. The reported multiplex potential for this technique is very limited.",

It is very simple, robust, highly sensitive, specific, fully automated with multiplexing potential and high-throughput applications. It can detect up to 50 different SNPs at a time with a detection limit of as low as 25pM [68], [73]. It has been widely used for various genotyping platforms. It has been developed by MRC Holland since 2002. Unlike the GLCR based LCx Abbott Diagnostic technique, the MLPA technique is considered to be the most effective and the most favored LCR technique for SNP genotyping. The only drawback for this powerful technique is high incurred cost with the use of either a genetic analyzer or a microarray scanner. This could be overcome through the use of fabricated electrode array [73]. MOL-PCR is another widely used LCR technique that is similar to MLPA but with flow cytometric detection that enabled better sensitivity and faster analysis [74], [75], [76]. It is widely used with multiplexing potential and high-throughput application as it can detect 50 SNPs/well in a 96 well plate. It requires very expensive flow cytometry based analyzer (Luminex) and xMAP microsphere beads. DOL utilizes dye labeled ligation probes and FRET detection with real-time monitoring for presence of alleles. This assay is very simple, sensitive, specific and amenable for multiplexing and high-throughput analysis. The entire assay takes less than 3 h [78].",

Early screening for these genetic variants is of extreme importance as it could be considered as a warning alarm to take all possible parameters that could help in alleviating disease severity, progression and, if possible, launching of early medication to save lives. This necessitates the use of advanced bio-sensing platforms that are sensitive, specific, robust and affordable with multiplexing and high-throughput capabilities without being expensive and time consuming. Next generation and Sanger sequencing have been used successfully for this purpose for a while but there are still many limitations with this approach as sequencing is very expensive, unaffordable by many researchers, time consuming and also challenging. Several other affordable screening assays have been developed over the past few decades with certain limitations in specificity, sensitivity, cost effectiveness and/or time savings.",

Since that time, LCR was considered the most favored platform for SNP genotyping as it was inexpensive, affordable and time saving. The main limitations for LCR were lack of multiplexing capabilities and high-throughput applications. Over the past few decades, several modifications and detection strategies have been introduced to both LCR and ligation based amplifications to overcome those limitations. This review outlines and evaluates recent advances and modifications introduced to LCR and ligation based amplifications such as electrochemical and magnetic biosensors, nanoparticles, quantum dots, DNAzyme, quartz crystal and leaky surface acoustic wave biosensors, rolling circle amplification, strand displacement amplification, surface enhanced raman scattering, chemiluminescence and fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Particular emphasis on sensitivity and limitation parameters for each platform is also detailed. Some of those integrated technologies have been commercialized for real applications in various fields. SNP genotyping assays for diverse genetic diseases, bacterial and viral pathogen detections are also discussed in this article. The versatility of these integrated technologies could pave the way towards achieving ideal multiplex SNP genotyping assays that are affordable with enhanced sensitivity, specificity, simplicity, robustness and high-throughput analyses in genome wide screening. Currently, the only limitation left for these advanced technologies is our imagination for such powerful innovations.",
