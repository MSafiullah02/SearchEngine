In addition, CAP cases may be caused by rare zoonotic or environmental pathogens. A well\u2010known example is Legionella pneumophila (Fields et al., 2002). Legionella is found ubiquitously in water and moist soil, and accounts for 0.5\u201315% of all CAP (Fields et al., 2002). Chlamydia psittaci is a zoonotic pathogen and infections occur primarily in bird owners, veterinarians and poultry workers, mainly through inhalation of aerosols from faeces of infected birds. C. psittaci outbreaks have also been described, mainly among visitors of bird fairs (Belchior et al., 2011). Cattle, sheep and goats are the most common reservoirs for Coxiella burnetii. C. burnetii is responsible for Q fever, which has a wide variety of clinical manifestations, including pneumonia (Dijkstra et al., 2012).",

Initial treatment of CAP is empirical, but a thorough understanding of the likely pathogens may lead to different treatment decisions. Some guidelines recommend macrolide monotherapy for outpatient treatment, despite an increasing rate of resistance of S. pneumoniae for this antibiotic (Mandell et al., 2007; Woodhead et al., 2011). Other guidelines for non\u2010severe pneumonia advocate initial therapy with amoxicillin, a treatment not suitable for atypical organisms such as M. pneumoniae or zoonotic organisms such a C. burnetii (Lim et al., 2009; Wiersinga et al., 2012).",

As environmental and especially zoonotic infections are rare causes of illness, these are not consistently included in diagnostic algorithms. Adding these routinely may not be cost\u2010effective as using molecular diagnostics for testing a wide range of respiratory pathogens for each patient with CAP is costly. The use of spatial analysis to quickly detect cluster formation of an unusual elevation of cases could be very helpful in these circumstances. We therefore conducted a case\u2013control study to investigate whether there is an association between CAP with known and unknown aetiology and living in an area with a high density of farm animals.",

Distances between coordinates of patients' home addresses and all animal farms within a 1 km radius were calculated using geographic information system (arcgis 9.3.1, Esri, Redlands, CA, USA). Binary and continuous variables indicating the presence (yes: at least one animal of a specific species present on a farm within 1 km, no: no animals of that species on a farm within 1 km) and the total number of specific farm animal species present on farms within 1 km from the home address were created.",

The presence of one or more farms (all types) or specific farm animal species within 1 km from the home address (present yes/no) was compared between cases and controls by means of the chi\u2010square test. To assess whether the number of animals near the home address was a risk factor for CAP, we further compared the number of animals within 1 km from the home address between cases and controls by means of a nonparametric test (Wilcoxon). These comparisons were restricted to subjects who were living within 1 km of at least one specific animal. Variables that were associated with case status in the univariate tests for the presence or the number of animals (P < 0.10) were included in a multiple logistic regression model with backward variable selection to evaluate potential independent farm\u2010related risk factors of CAP. The presence of a specific farm animal (yes/no) was included in the model together with the number of animals. To allow direct interpretation of the adjusted odds ratio for the presence of a specific animal, the number of animals was mean\u2010centred, while keeping 0 for those with 0 of those animals (Leffondre et al., 2002). This provides interpretable odds ratios in one model of (i) the qualitative effect of the presence of a specific animal and (ii) the quantitative effect of the number of these animals among subjects with >0 of those animals around their home. Odds ratios for an interquartile range increase in the number of animals were calculated.",

Infection may occur through inhalation of dust particles or aerosols containing C. burnetii (Tissot\u2010Dupont et al., 2004). In our study, C. burnetii was detected more often in patients with CAP, in contrast with published literature. This was due to a large Q fever outbreak in the Netherlands between 2007 and 2010 which coincided with the enrolment of our study population (Delsing et al., 2010). Previous studies have suggested an airborne spread of C. burnetii in this outbreak (Schimmer et al., 2010; Dijkstra et al., 2012). Pneumonia was the most frequent diagnosis (61.5%) among the notified Q fever patients in the epidemic in the Netherlands (Dijkstra et al., 2012).

Earlier identification of clusters could lead to a faster mitigation of an outbreak and a better understanding of the disease aetiology, and awareness of an outbreak could lead to the use of targeted diagnostics and, if necessary, antibiotics. van den Wijngaard et al. (2011) demonstrated that the use of syndromic surveillance such as pneumonia or lower respiratory infection combined with GIS on hospitalizations leads to the detection of Q fever clusters, but again, this was based on retrospective analysis. For practical applicability, real\u2010time cluster detection should be combined with algorithms that target diagnostic work\u2010ups to patients with increased risk of a zoonotic infection (van der Have and van der Lubben, 2011).

Epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to particulate matter could be a risk factor for pneumonia (Neupane et al., 2010). Reedijk et al.

Nevertheless, in a previous study that used this database, strong associations between the presence of livestock and infectious diseases were reported (Smit et al., 2012).",

To take this into consideration, we also computed the inverse distance weighted number of goats. For each farm with goats within 1 km, we divided the number of goats on that farm by the squared distance between the farm and the patients' home address. We summed these weighted numbers of goats for all farms with goats within 1 km. Nonparametric analysis (Wilcoxon) showed that the weighted number of goats within 1 km of the home was significantly higher in cases than in controls (P\u2010value of 0.03), showing similar results as for the (unweighted) number of goats. For clarity, we decided to present the unweighted number of animals.",

Patients with CAP caused by L. pneumophila were often living within 1 km of one or more farms (85.7%, versus 62.7% of controls), but numbers of patients infected with L. pneumophila (or C. psittaci) were deemed too low to justify a further in\u2010depth statistical analysis. A potential risk factor for infection with L. pneumophila is air scrubbers. Air scrubbers are increasingly applied to reduce ammonia emissions from animal housing, and it could be hypothesized that the presence of air scrubbers may be linked to L. pneumophila infection in neighbouring residents of animal farms. This question, however, needs to be addressed in studies with larger number of patients.",
