In the present work, we compare different quasistationary (QS) simulation methods where the absorbing states are suitably handled and the thermodynamical limit of the original dynamics can be achieved. We analyze the standard QS (SQS) method, where the sampling is constrained to active configurations, the reflecting boundary condition (RBC), where the dynamics returns to the pre-absorbing configuration, and hub reactivation (HR), where the most connected vertex of the network is reactivated after a visit to an absorbing state. We apply the methods to the contact process (CP) and susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) models on regular and scale free networks. The investigated methods yield the same epidemic threshold for both models. For CP, that undergoes a standard collective phase transition, the methods are equivalent. For SIS, whose phase transition is ruled by the hub mutual reactivation, the SQS and HR methods are able to capture localized epidemic phases while RBC is not. We also apply the autocorrelation time as a tool to characterize the phase transition and observe that this analysis provides the same finite-size scaling exponents for the critical relaxation time for the investigated methods. Finally, we verify the equivalence between RBC method and a weak external field for epidemics on networks.",

            "text": "Nonequilibrium phase transitions are observed in many physical, biological, social, and chemical systems [1] [2] [3] , to mention just a few examples. A fundamental class of nonequilibrium phenomena is the absorbing-state phase transition (APT) [1, 2, 4] that occurs when the system has accessible states where the dynamics remains permanently stuck, strongly violating detailed balance and thus implying the absence of equilibrium counterparts. One of the characteristic features of APTs is the interplay between the propagation and annihilation of particles that can represent hosts for an infectious disease, microorganisms, molecules in catalytic reactions, etc. When the ratio between propagation and annihilation is below a threshold, the density \u03c1 of active particles vanishes and an APT takes place.",

            "text": "A fundamental model that exhibits an APT is the contact process (CP) [5] , where infected individuals lying on a substrate (originally a lattice [5] but it was later extended to networks [6] ) can spontaneously be cured or infect one of their nearest neighbors. From the epidemiological viewpoint, the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model is canonical [7] . In SIS, the cure is the same as in CP, but the infection is transmitted at a rate \u03bb to each healthy neighbor of an infected vertex, while in CP the infection rate is divided by the vertex degree. On lattices, SIS and the CP have the same critical behavior belonging to the directed percolation (DP) universality class [4] . However, the nature of the phase transition of these models are different on complex networks with power-law (PL) degree distributions given by P (k) \u223c k \u2212\u03b3 , where P (k) is the probability that a randomly chosen vertex of the network connects to other k vertices. While CP exhibits a transition at a finite threshold that involves the collective activation of the entire network [8] , the transition of the SIS model occurs at a threshold that goes to zero in the thermodynamical limit and is triggered by the mutual reactivation of hubs (vertices with very large degree) [8, 9] .",

Even for simple dynamical processes most of the exact results are bounds [11] and analytical approximations based on mean-field theories are generically used to quantitatively predict the behavior of such processes on networks [10, 11] . Dynamical correlations play an important role irrespective of the infinite dimensionality of networks [30] [31] [32] and mean-field theories are approximations that call for complementary analysis based on computer simulations. For example, the existence of localized epidemic phases [17, 18, 33, 34] and the slow subcritical dynamics due to rare (locally supercritical) regions [20, 33, 35, 36] on networks with PL degree distribution have recently been discussed, grounded on simulations. Notice that localization is related to metastability at subcritical phases [35] and can play an important role in the quasistationarity of the dynamical process.",

Moreover, standard dynamic methods for simulations of APTs as, e.g., spreading or decay simulations [4] , are not effective in complex networks due to the small-world property [29] that makes the dynamics to probe the network finiteness very quickly. An alternative is to consider the so-called quasistationary (QS) state where the original dynamics is perturbed to skip the absorbing state in a such way that this perturbation becomes irrelevant in the infinite-size limit for all intensive quantities of interest and a finite-size scaling (FSS) technique provides the correct thermodynamical limit as well as the critical exponents associated with the APT [1, 4] .",

Imposing that the critical density of particles produced by the external field is negligible when compared with the QS density and assuming f \u223c N \u2212\u03b1 , we have that the condition\u03c1 ex \u03c1 qs is satisfied for \u03b1 > \u03b2 * \u03b4 h 1; the last inequality is verified considering the critical exponents \u03b2 * = (0.252,0.398,0.464,1/2) and \u03b4 h = (9.23,3.72,2.52,2) for DP in d = 1,2,3 and d 4, respectively [1] . The total creation in absorbing states goes to zero in the thermodynamical limit and the dynamics gets trapped for diverging times into the absorbing states. Computationally it is not a problem since it is implemented as a time step t = 1/f N ; see Sec. III B. Hence, we must construct the QS distributions using only the nonabsorbing part of the simulations as",

For a more general case, we consider a connected graph with N vertices and a quenched (not changing in time) connection structure. Each vertex i of the network has k i edges connecting to nearest neighbors and can be either infected (\u03c3 i = 1) or susceptible (\u03c3 i = 0). Infected vertices spread activity through the network by direct susceptible contacts. An infected vertex i transmits the infection to each of its susceptible nearest neighbors with a rate \u03bb/k i , in which \u03bb is the control parameter. In turn, infected vertices become spontaneously susceptible with rate 1 fixing the time unit. In SIS model, the infection rate is \u03bb for each edge connecting infected and susceptible vertices irrespective of their degrees while the healing process is the same of CP. So, one can easily realize that the state \u03c3 i = 0 for all vertices is absorbing in both models. The limit between persistence and extinction of activity is delimited by a critical value \u03bb c of the control parameter. The density of infected vertices at the stationary state,\u03c1, is the order parameter that is null in the absorbing phase \u03bb < \u03bb c and reaches a steady value for \u03bb > \u03bb c .",

The central results are that, in the thermodynamical limit, CP has a finite threshold and undergoes an APT with well-defined FSS exponents. For infinite-size PL networks, the SIS model does not exhibit an APT such that an endemic active phase is observed for any finite infection rate \u03bb > 0. However, for finite sizes the SIS effectively has a threshold [9, 15, 17, 18, 30, 42] and the APT, including FSS exponents, can also be investigated numerically.",

The CP threshold was subtracted by 1 to improve visibility. The solid line is a PL regression and the dashed one is the epidemic threshold of the CP in the limit of very large networks given in Ref. [31] . The degree exponent is \u03b3 = 2.7. and HR methods. Notice that the SQS exponents for SIS and CP are the same within uncertainties. The FSS of the autocorrelation time and epidemic lifespan for SIS model are shown in Fig. 7(b) . As in the case of RRN networks, the time \u03c4 a increases logarithmically for RBC and HR (data not shown for the latter) methods. On the other hand, the autocorrelation times provide the same scaling for RBC, HR, and SQS that agrees with the scaling of \u03c4 a obtained via the SQS method. Assuming a scaling \u03c4 \u223c N z * , we found the same exponent z * = 0.33 (1) for \u03c4 c in all methods and \u03c4 a in SQS. Equivalent results were obtained for CP with an exponent z * = 0.40 (1) .",

In RBC, the probability of returning to the absorbing configuration in the next step after the epidemic is restarted is p abs = 1/(1 + \u03bb c k), where k is the degree of the vertex where the activity ended and returned subsequently. Since the pre-absorbing state will, with large probability, be in a vertex of low degree, which represents the great majority of vertices in the network, and remembering that \u03bb c (N ) \u2192 0 as N \u2192 \u221e, the probability that the system falls back into the absorbing state in the next step goes to 1. In the HR method, the particle returns to a vertex of degree k = k c \u223c min[N 1/2 ,N 1/(\u03b3 \u22121) ] such that \u03bb c (N )k 1 and the probability to produce an outbreak with n > 1 infected vertices goes to 1. So this qualitatively explain why HR is similar to SQS rather than RBC since the long-term regime of SQS is constituted by a large number of configurations with n 1, many of them neighboring the hubs and increasing the chance of their reactivation. Note that in the CP dynamics, the system returns to the absorbing state with probability p abs = 1/(1 + \u03bb c ) < 1/2 irrespective of the vertex degree and a new outbreak with n > 1 has a finite probability to happen in both RBC and HR. The autocorrelation is insensitive to this detail and provides the same FSS scaling exponents for all methods. and time between attempts of visits to the absorbing state (\u03c4 a ) for the SIS model. The SQS data for \u03c4 a is divided by a factor 10 2 to improve the visibility. The lines represent PL regressions. The averages were performed over 10 network realizations and the error bars are smaller than the symbols.",

[18, 36] . These outliers generate localized metastable patches that can be independently activated, manifested as multiple peaks in the susceptibility of the SIS model on large networks simulated with the SQS method [18, 30, 42, 54] . Susceptibility curves comparing the different methods for the same network realization are shown in Fig. 8 . A remarkable difference is that the peak observed at small \u03bb in SQS curves, which is due to the activity localized in the most connected vertex of the network [18, 42] , is not observed in the RBC but is in the HR method. The secondary peaks are associated to the lifespan divergence [18] . The SQS and HR methods are equivalent. The activation of the most connected vertex is not captured by RBC method but it is for the other two methods. A smearing of the transition [36, 59, 60] in SQS and HR methods is more evident than in the case \u03b3 = 2.7. As expected, above the epidemic threshold, the methods become equivalent since the absorbing state was never visited in the simulations. It is worth mentioning that the multiple transitions are not artifacts of the SQS simulations, and are also observed with the HR and RBC methods. Figure 9 shows the scaling of the epidemic threshold of SIS model for \u03b3 = 3.5 and \u03b3 = 4.0 as a function of the network size. One can see that the size dependences are remarkably similar for the three methods and the differences are inside uncertainties.",

Aiming at investigating epidemic processes with steady states via stochastic simulations, one needs to resort to the QS approaches, which suitably handle the absorbing states, along with a finite-size analysis. In these approaches a perturbation of the original dynamics, which is negligible in the thermodynamical limit of the active phase, is introduced. We investigated distinct QS methods: The SQS has sampling constrained to active configurations; the RBC, where the dynamics returns to the configuration that it was immediately prior the visit to the absorbing state; the HR method, where the epidemic is restarted in one of the most connected vertices of the network; and a weak external field (WEF) that introduces spontaneous infection. Two distinct epidemic models with active steady state were considered, the CP [4] and the SIS [11] models, whose phase transitions have different natures [8] .",

For SIS, the same thresholds are obtained for all methods but the FSS of the critical density provides scaling exponents for RBC and WEF different from SQS and HR methods. Also, RBC and WEF do not capture epidemic activity localized in the most connected vertex of the network. So, if one wishes an analysis rid of localized epidemics, RBC method is indicated but if one also needs to resolve localization the SQS or HR are more appropriated. The SQS is theoretically well grounded [46, 48, 53] but it is algorithmically more complicated and computationally less efficient than the other investigated methods.",

Moreover, for the other investigated methods the epidemic lifespan does not correspond to the characteristic relaxation time. In order to overcome these difficulties we analyzed the autocorrelation time of the QS series for the different methods. Autocorrelation provides the characteristic relaxation time, including in the supercritical regime. We found the same FSS exponents for all investigated methods irrespective of the network and epidemic models considered. In particular, applying the autocorrelation method to regular lattices of dimension d = 1, 2, and 3 as well as RRN (d = \u221e), the directed percolation exponents were obtained.",
