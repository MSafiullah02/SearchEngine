The genome begins with a 5'untranslated region (UTR) consisting of the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). At present, five IRES types (type-I to type-V) are known in picornaviruses (Hellen and de Breyne, 2007, Sweeney et al., 2012). The viral genome encodes a single polyprotein transcribing from a single open reading frame (ORF). The polyprotein is cleavaged into smaller functionally active proteins: P1 encodes the viral capsid proteins; and P2 and P3 encode the non-structural proteins (Knowles et al., 2012, Palmenberg et al., 2010). In addition, most of the picornaviruses encode a leader (L) protein before the P1 region. At the 3\u2032 end of the genome it has a 3\u2032UTR and a poly(A)-tail. The picornavirus genomes consist of several additional secondary RNA structures (e.g. cis-acting replication element (CRE), \u201cbarbell\u201d-like structures) (Boros et al., 2012, Boros et al., 2014, McKnight and Lemon, 1998, Steil and Barton, 2009, Yang et al., 2008). The genome location of CREs and their contribution to viral RNA replication have been determined and the \u201cbarbell\u201d-like structure has been investigated in some picornaviruses (Boros et al., 2012, Pankovics et al., 2015, Steil and Barton, 2009).",

In the GenBank database, 68% sequence identity was found between Rabbit01/2013/HUN (from nt 340 to nt 750) and the Aichi virus (AB040749) 5\u2032UTR (from nt 348 to nt 707). Based upon the nucleotide identity and the predicted secondary RNA structure of Rabbit01/2013/HUN 5\u2032UTR-IRES it has a potential type-V IRES with conserved elements (Fig. 2A). The first 347 nt of the 5\u2032UTR contained several Aichi virus-like stem\u2013loop secondary structures with high 60.4% GC content and showed 70% partial sequence identity from nt 93 to nt 182 to European roller Kobuvirus (KJ934637) (from nt 118 to nt 207) (Fig. 2A), but the ori region (origin of replication) was not detected (Sweeney et al., 2012, Pankovics et al., 2015). The apex of Ia and Ib hairpins and Ja\u2013Jc hairpins are highly similar to those of Aichi virus. The apex of the Jb contains the GNRA motif and the K hairpin also contains two highly conserved sequences, AGGUACCCC (nt 669 to 677) and GGGAUCUGA (nt 689 to 697), as in Kobuvirus IRESs. This bipartite base-paired motif is functionally important, and interacts with initiation factor eIF4G in type-II IRESs (Yu et al., 2011). A significant polypyrimidine tract was found upstream of the initiation codon of Rabbit01/2013/HUN. The Yn-Xm-AUG motif is Y18-X10-A751UG where the 18 nt polypyrimidine (Y) tract was followed by a 10 nt spacer sequence (X) (Fig. 2A).

Based on the amino acid sequence identity and phylogenetic analyses, rabbit picornavirus is related to viruses in the lineage of the genera Kobuvirus, Salivirus and Sakobuvirus. According to the taxonomic genus and species demarcation criteria of International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) (http://www.picornastudygroup.com/definition/genus_definition.htm), novel picornavirus genera are defined, if amino acid (aa) identity in P1, P2 and P3 regions are less than 40%, 40% and 50%, respectively. In addition, novel Kobuvirus species are classified, if the aa difference in the complete polyprotein, P1, 2C and 3CD proteins are less than 70%, 70%, 80% and 80%, respectively. In the complete polyprotein, P1, P2, P3 and 3CD regions of rabbit picornavirus showed 52\u201359% amino acid identity to the corresponding proteins of different types of kobuviruses (especially Aichivirus A) and 52% in 2C to Salivirus. Based on these data the rabbit picornavirus strain Rabbit01/2013/HUN is a novel picornavirus species and considered as a potential member of the genus Kobuvirus; however, the formal classification of rabbit picornavirus at the genus level is subject to further discussion by the ICTV. During the manuscript preparation, novel bat picornavirus sequences from respiratory and gastrointestinal samples of bats (Miniopterus fuliginosus) in China were deposited in GenBank as unpublished data. These two partial unassigned genome sequences (KJ641686 and KJ641691) from bats seems to be the closest relatives of rabbit picornavirus with 50.2/49.4%, 58.2/54.7% and 63.4/65% amino acid identities in P1, 2C and 3CD regions, respectively.",

In addition, kobuviruses are also detected in environmental samples (Ng et al., 2012). Rabbit can now be included as a potential host species of kobuviruses. Rabbits are common livestock animals and its breeding has a long tradition. Rabbits keep in large commercial farms, small house-keeping farms and as pets in close contact with humans. Picornaviruses were detected in rabbit faecal samples originated from two (commercial and family) different types of lapine farms in two geographical regions (270 km apart) in Hungary. Rabbits shedding picornavirus in the faeces did not show obvious clinical signs. These data indicate that rabbit is the potential host species of this novel picornavirus but further epidemiological and molecular studies will be required to investigate the biology, disease spectrum and pathogenesis of this picornavirus in domesticated and wild rabbits and other potential host species including humans.",
