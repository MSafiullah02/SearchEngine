            "text": "Proteolytic processing of precursor polyproteins is a key step in the replication cycle of many viruses. It is tightly regulated, allowing step-wise release of precursor and mature forms of the viral proteins (for reviews see Dougherty and Semler, 1993, Spall et al., 1997). The picornavirus 3C proteinases (3C-Pro) and the related 3C-like proteinases from coronaviruses, potyviruses, comoviruses and nepoviruses are a well-studied group of enzymes that have structural homology to chymotrypsin (Bazan and Fletterick, 1988, Gorbalenya et al., 1989, Allaire et al., 1994, Matthews et al., 1994, Mosimann et al., 1997). Proteolytic processing efficiency at different 3C-Pro and 3C-like-Pro cleavage sites in the viral polyproteins can vary widely. Predominant cleavage sites are generally characterized by a conserved amino acid sequence at the cleavage site (Dougherty et al., 1988, Long et al., 1989, Pallai et al., 1989) and by favorable secondary structure of the protein around the cleavage site (Ypma-Wong et al., 1988b). Additional mechanisms also contribute to the regulation of the proteinase activity at specific cleavage sites. In comoviruses, a co-factor increases the activity of the proteinase on some cleavage sites but decreases its activity on other sites (Peters et al., 1992a, Peters et al., 1992b). In poliovirus, the activity of the 3C-Pro is regulated by the presence of the 3D domain on intermediate precursors (Ypma-Wong et al., 1988a, Jore et al., 1988) and by the interaction of the 3C-Pro with the 3AB protein (Molla et al., 1994). In two nepoviruses of subgroups A and B, the presence of the VPg domain on partially processed precursors of the proteinase was shown to modulate the activity of the proteinase although the specific effect of the VPg domain on the proteinase activity differed between the two viruses considered (Margis et al., 1994, Hemmer et al., 1995).",

The cleavage site specificity of the ToRSV proteinase was shown to be different from that of proteinases of nepoviruses of subgroups A and B (Hans and Sanfa\u00e7on, 1995, Carrier et al., 1999) and a consensus amino acid sequence for ToRSV cleavage sites was identified [(C or V)Q/(G or S); Wang et al., 1999, Carrier et al., 1999]. Mutational analysis of two ToRSV cleavage sites has confirmed the importance of these amino acids in processing efficiency (Carrier et al., 1999). Also, cleavage sites were identified at the N-terminus of each of the ToRSV polyproteins which are not present in the polyproteins of nepoviruses of subgroups A and B (Wang and Sanfa\u00e7on, 2000, Carrier et al., 2001). Indeed, the ToRSV P1 polyprotein is cleaved at five cleavage sites and the P2 polyprotein is cleaved at three cleavage sites (instead of four and two cleavage sites in the P1 and P2 polyproteins, respectively, of characterized nepoviruses of subgroups A and B).",

Cleavage at the VPg-Pro cleavage site was inefficient in a variety of polyprotein precursors produced in an E. coli expression system or in an vitro translation system, resulting in the accumulation of the VPg-Pro precursor (Wang et al., 1999, Wang and Sanfa\u00e7on, 2000). This suggested that the VPg-Pro precursor may play a special role in the regulation of the processing of ToRSV polyproteins. Therefore it was of interest to determine the activity of the mature ToRSV proteinase in comparison to that of the VPg-Pro precursor. Here we report the purification of active recombinant ToRSV proteinase from E. coli cells in its mature (Pro) and precursor (VPg-Pro) forms and the characterization of their proteolytic activities.",

Plasmid pET21d-Pro was derived from the intermediate plasmid by performing in vitro mutagenesis (Fisher and Pei, 1997) using primers JC-1 (5\u2032 CACCACCACCACCACCACTGAG 3\u2032, from the pET21d vector sequence, Novagen) and 39 (5\u2032 CTGGCAAGGAGCAAAAGAAG 3\u2032, corresponding to nts 4535\u20134515 on ToRSV RNA1, numbering according to Rott et al., 1995) and Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). This removed the DNA sequence corresponding to the N-terminal region of the polymerase gene and introduced the His(x6) tag in frame with the C-terminus of the proteinase. Plasmid pET21d-VPg-Pro was derived from plasmid pET15b-VPg-Pro-N-Pol (Wang et al., 1999) in a similar manner using primers JC-1 and 39 as above. To introduce a mutation in the VPg-Pro cleavage site (substitution of the Gln at the \u22121 position of the cleavage site for an Ala) encoded by plasmids pET21d-VPg-Pro and pET15b-VPg-Pro-N-Pol, site-directed mutagenesis was conducted using primers 53 (5\u2032 CGCTACAGATTGTGGGCGGAA 3\u2032; nts 3794\u20133774 of RNA1, altered sequence is bold and italicized) and 52 (5\u2032 GGTTCTTCTTTGGCGGAAGCG 3\u2032, complementary to nts 3795\u20133816 on RNA1) to produce plasmids pET21d-VPg-ProQ1264A and pET15b-VPg- Pro-N-PolQ1264A, respectively. To construct plasmid pT7-cX1-X2, a 1151 bp fragment of a full-length clone of RNA1 (plasmid pMR10, Rott et al., 1995) was amplified using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and earlier described oligonucleotides W034 (corresponding to RNA1 nts 786\u2013801 and engineered to include a NcoI site; Wang and Sanfa\u00e7on, 2000) and W027 (complementary to RNA1 nts 1922\u20131937 and engineered to include a SalI site). The amplified fragment was digested with NcoI and SalI and inserted in the corresponding sites of plasmid pCITE-4a(+) (Novagen).

To produce substrate X2-NTB, plasmid pT7-X2-Pro (Wang and Sanfa\u00e7on, 2000) was digested with XhoI (located at nt 3393 on ToRSV RNA1), and run-off transcripts were synthesized in vitro using the T7 RNA polymerase (Gibco-BRL) as described earlier (Hans and Sanfa\u00e7on, 1995). The run-off transcript was then used as a template in the standard rabbit reticulocyte system (Promega) as described earlier (Hans and Sanfa\u00e7on, 1995). Proteolytic processing of the substrates was tested by adding exogenous proteinase to the in vitro translation products. Proteolytic processing reactions were performed in the presence of 1 mM DTT; 100 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.5 and 10% glycerol. The reactions were stopped by the addition of one volume of (2\u00d7) SDS-PAGE sample buffer (120 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 6.8; 4% SDS; 20% glycerol; 10% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol; 0.02% bromophenol blue) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Time-course experiments were conducted using several dilutions of the proteinase to ensure that the reactions were in the linear range. The gels were scanned using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The amount of radioactivity in individual bands was measured using ImageQuant as described by the supplier. The cpm values were adjusted for the number of methionine residues present in each protein. The percentage of precursor that was converted to one of the cleaved products (32 kDa MP for the MP-CAT precursor, 38 kDa MP for the X4-MP precursors and 38.5 kDa X3 for the X3-X4 precursor) was calculated at each time point as earlier described in Carrier et al. (1999). The cleavage products chosen for this calculation met the following two criteria: the product was stable over time and it migrated in an area of the gel devoid of contaminating background bands. Very similar results were obtained when the calculation was made with the other cleavage product (data not shown). In the case of the X4-MP precursor only the predominant precursor is considered in the calculation. As earlier mentioned (Carrier et al., 1999), other minor precursors were also produced by internal translation initiation and similar processing kinetics were obtained when these precursors were also considered in the calculation (data not shown). In experiments, where the effect of temperature or pH on the activity of the Pro and VPg-Pro was tested, the proteinases were first preincubated at the appropriate temperature or in the appropriate buffer for 30 min prior to the addition of the MP-CAT substrate.",

Slow processing at the VPg-Pro cleavage site of a larger precursor (pET15b-VPg-Pro-N-Pol, see Fig. 1 and Fig. 2\nA) containing the N-terminal region of the polymerase was also earlier shown (Wang et al., 1999). To eliminate this processing and ensure that the VPg-Pro preparation did not contain trace amounts of the mature proteinase, a mutation was introduced at the \u22121 position of the VPg-Pro cleavage site (Q1264 to A). To verify that this mutation did not negatively affect the proteolytic activity of the Pro, this mutation was first introduced into the VPg-Pro-N-Pol precursors and cis-cleavage at the Pro-Pol site was monitored. Expression of the wild-type VPg-Pro-N-Pol precursor at 25 \u00b0C resulted in the release of the VPg-Pro intermediate and of the mature proteinase as earlier described (Wang et al., 1999 see Fig. 2B, lanes 1, 3 and 5). Following expression of the VPg-Pro-PolQ1264A precursor at 25 \u00b0C, the VPg-Pro cleavage product was detected but not the mature proteinase (see Fig. 2B, lanes 2, 4 and 6). This result indicated that the Q1264 to A mutation prevented cleavage at the VPg-Pro site and further that it did not affect the proteolytic activity of the proteinase on the Pro-Pol site. This mutation was, therefore, introduced into the VPg-Pro precursors to allow the production of recombinant ToRSV VPg-Pro.",

However, at lower temperatures (25 \u00b0C), some protein remained in the soluble fraction. Recombinant proteinase was purified from the soluble fraction as described in Section 2. The degree of purity of the proteinase obtained by this method was 80\u201390% after purification using Ni+2-NTA-agarose (as estimated by SDS-PAGE analysis, see Fig. 3\n) and the yield was 50\u2013100 \u03bcg of purified proteinase per liter of culture. Preparations of recombinant proteinase were tested for their proteolytic activity using the earlier described MP-CAT substrate which contains the MP-CP cleavage site (Wang and Sanfa\u00e7on, 2000). As shown earlier, incubation of the MP-CAT precursor with the recombinant proteinase resulted in the production of two additional proteins that corresponded to the cleaved MP and the CP-CAT proteins (see below). Mutated recombinant proteinases (i.e. containing a His to Asp substitution in the putative catalytic triad or a His to Leu substitution in the putative substrate binding pocket) purified using the same method were not active on the MP-CAT substrate (data not shown). This demonstrated that the activity observed with the wild-type recombinant proteinase was not due to an E. coli protease contaminating the preparation. Recombinant proteinase was also purified from the insoluble fraction and resolubilized by progressive dialysis in decreasing concentration of urea. Although highly purified proteinase was obtained by this method, the specific activity of the proteinase was ten to a hundred times less than that obtained with the proteinase purified from the soluble fraction suggesting that only a portion of the molecules were properly refolded (data not shown).

As a first step, precursor MP-CAT containing the MP-CP cleavage site was tested (Fig. 5\nA). The molecular masses of the Pro and VPg-Pro differed by only 10% (27 kDa for Pro and 30 kDa for VPg-Pro). Therefore, equivalent amounts of each proteinase (in ng) were initially used to compare their activities. The Pro was found to be considerably more active than the VPg-Pro on the MP-CAT substrate (Fig. 5B). To determine more precisely the relative processing activities of the Pro and VPg-Pro, time-course experiments were conducted on serial dilutions of several individual proteinase preparations to ensure that the reactions were in the linear range. A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 5C and D. The results revealed that the Pro was 5\u201310 times more active than the VPg-Pro on the MP-CAT substrate. Proteolytic activities of the Pro and VPg-Pro were also tested on substrates containing the other two P2 cleavage sites. Results with the X4-MP substrate (containing the cleavage site at the N-terminus of the movement protein domain) were similar to those obtained with the MP-CAT substrate (see Fig. 6\n). Indeed, the Pro was found to be also 5\u201310 times more active than the VPg-Pro on the X4-MP substrate.",

In a related nepovirus (Grapevine fanleaf virus, GFLV, a nepovirus of subgroup A), although the mature proteinase could not process P1 cleavage sites in trans, the VPg-Pro precursor had the ability to cleave at least one P1 cleavage site in trans (X-NTB cleavage site, located immediately upstream of the NTB domain; Margis et al., 1994). To investigate the possibility that the ToRSV VPg-Pro may possess a similar activity, in vitro trans-processing assays were conducted with the purified VPg-Pro (Q1264 to A). Several precursors were tested which included three earlier described cleavage sites in the N-terminal region of P1 (the X1-X2, X2-NTB and NTB-VPg cleavage sites; Wang and Sanfa\u00e7on, 2000). The precursors (cX1-X2, X2-NTB, cNTB-VPg) used are shown in Fig. 8\nA. As a control for the proteinase activity, the X3-X4 precursor was included in this study. To ensure that low levels of cleavage could be detected, the incubation period was extended to 16 h. The reactions were conducted at 16 \u00b0C to preserve the activity of the proteinase during the incubation. Although cleavage of the X3-X4 precursor was evident under these conditions, cleavage of the cX1-X2, X2-NTB and cNTB-VPg precursors was not detected (Fig. 8B).",

However, we were unsuccessful in detecting these proteins in total extracts or in membrane-enriched fractions from ToRSV- infected cucumber or Nicotiana benthamiana plants. This could be explained by a low concentration of these proteins in the plant or by specific modifications of these proteins in plants that preclude their recognition by the antibodies used in this study. At this point, we can only speculate that the VPg-Pro may be the predominant form of proteinase activity early during the course of infection although we cannot exclude the possibility that plant factors may influence the processing of the P1 polyprotein by increasing cleavage at the VPg-Pro site. Assuming that initial polyprotein processing of P1 in vivo parallels that observed in vitro, the slow release of the mature proteinase from the VPg-Pro precursor may provide a mechanism by which cis-cleavage of the P1 polyprotein at the Pro-Pol site is favored early in infection allowing the release of proteins involved in viral replication while trans-cleavage of the P2 polyprotein is more efficient later in infection allowing the release of the movement protein and coat protein, and subsequently of the X3 and X4 proteins.",

            "text": "Differential proteolytic activities in precursor and mature forms of the proteinase have also been shown for related nepoviruses. Indeed, the GFLV VPg-Pro was found to be less active than the Pro on RNA2-encoded cleavage sites and more active than the Pro on an RNA1-encoded cleavage site (Margis et al., 1994). However, in contrast with the ToRSV proteinase, the presence of the VPg domain on precursors containing the GFLV proteinase did not influence the cis-processing of the Pro-Pol cleavage site but instead, increased trans-processing at the cleavage site upstream of the NTB domain. Interestingly, in the case of another nepovirus (TBRV), the VPg domain was also shown to modulate the activity of the proteinase (Hemmer et al., 1995). The presence of the VPg domain on precursors containing the TBRV proteinase resulted in increased trans-cleavage of RNA2-encoded cleavage sites and increased cis-cleavage at the Pro-Pol site. These results suggest that nepoviruses share common mechanisms to regulate the processing of the RNA1 and RNA2-encoded polyproteins through the accumulation of proteinase precursors containing the VPg domain. However, these results also suggest that there are many variations on this theme, i.e. the effect of the VPg domain on the proteinase activity varies from one nepovirus to another. Interestingly, in potyviruses, although both the VPg-Pro (NIa) and the Pro (NIa-Pro) accumulate in plants, no differential activity was observed between them (Parks et al., 1992). Therefore, modulation of the proteinase activity by the VPg domain may be a characteristic feature of nepoviruses.",
