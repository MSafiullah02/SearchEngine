It resulted from overheating of a reactor core, while testing a safety procedure. An estimated 56 deaths occurred, including 28 radiation deaths among reactor operators and firefighters.41 Additionally, it is estimated that there may be have been hundreds of subsequent cancer occurrences among the adjacent population, as well as among the 6 million people who lived within the radiation fallout plume.42\n",

Nevertheless, these items required the same logistical support to unload or store, thus redirecting time and energy away from important relief efforts to things that were not as helpful.97 A hasty response that is not based on familiarity with local conditions contributes to more chaos.

            "text": "This effort represents our attempts to review a cross-section of representative disasters that illustrate recurring, important themes related to critical care and hospital disaster response. It is by no means comprehensive; unfortunately disasters that impact large numbers of patients, and require critical care resources occur commonly. We selected disasters for discussions that illustrate core principles relevant to critical care practitioners. To summarize these \u201clessons learned\u201d include:1.\nDisaster preparation typically focuses all pre-hospital care requirements, and often neglects the needs of the hospital, and especially intensive care units. This impacts ICU response in several ways including sufficiency of space, equipment and supplies, triage protocols, and so forth.2.\nA burgeoning number of non-hospitalized individuals with chronic critical illness. When a disaster occurs that limits access to advanced medical care, these patients rapidly decompensate, and in many circumstances utilize/consume more disaster response resources than primary casualties.3.\nFollowing a disaster, existing critical care resources may be insufficient to meet demand for services. Developing a deliberate plan (5) that pre-identifies alternative care sites for ICU patients is essential. This must include access to sufficient quantities of 50 psi oxygen, suctioning, medical devices, and necessary pharmacy support.4.\nFollowing a disaster of sufficient magnitude, non-critical care hospital personnel will be called to assist with the care of ICU patients. It is important to know, in advance what will be the scope of practice of these individuals, what education is needed to ensure that this care is efficient and of reliable quality, and who will provide supervision and assistance for these activities.5.\nFollowing a disaster, it is vitally important to ensure the protection of ICU personnel from communicable diseases/outbreaks, as well as physical harm. This requires a plan, practice, and proper education of staff.6.\nWhen a large scale disaster occurs, medical care processes quickly migrate below usual standards of care due to resource limitations. This degradation of care should be planned and not haphazard. This can also be pre-planned as it relates to access to mechanical ventilation, staffing ratios, aggressiveness of resuscitation based on probability of survival, etc. The goal is to predictably orchestrate transition from \u201cstandard of care\u201d to \u201csufficiency of care.\u201d\n",
