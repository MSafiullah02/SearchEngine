Structurally, niclosamide belongs to a large group of lipophilic, weakly acidic molecules called salicylanilides (Figure 1).3\n",

Early studies have linked niclosamide's activity to the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation.4 However, over the last decade or so, niclosamide has been shown to act on other targets such as Wnt/\u03b2\u2010catenin, mTOR and JAK/STAT3 signaling pathways (reviewed by Chen et al.5), which inevitably linked niclosamide's therapeutic potential to many diseases that involve these important signaling cascades. The increasing interest in niclosamide over the last decade is reflected in the significant increase in the number of publications regarding the study of this drug (Figure 2). Herein, we briefly discuss the numerous diseases niclosamide has shown promise in treating.\n",

The results showed that niclosamide is a potent activator of PINK1 in cells. The study showed that niclosamide is not a direct activator of PINK1, as no activation was observed when recombinant PINK1 was incubated with PINK1 in vitro. However, it was shown that niclosamide caused mitochondrial depolarization, a phenomenon that was found to be reversible following removal of niclosamide from the cell media.8 Impressively, niclosamide was also shown to activate PINK1 in cultured neurons. Together, this study highlights the PINK1\u2010mediated neuroprotective promise niclosamide may hold. Further in vivo studies in PD models are needed to establish the ability of niclosamide to treat this disease.",

Additionally, in db/db mice wherein diabetes is induced as a result of mutations causing deficiency in leptin receptor activity, niclosamide ethanolamine was shown to be effective in improving glycemic control, treating hyperglycemia, and slowing the progression of the disease. In a subsequent study, niclosamide piperazine, which is another salt form of niclosamide, was also found to have similar efficacy in treating T2DM.11 It has been suggested that niclosamide's antidiabetes therapeutic potential is due to the inhibition of the glucagon signaling PKA pathway.12\n",

Viral antigen synthesis was totally abolished at a niclosamide concentration as low as 1.56 \u03bcm.18 The exact mode of action is not clear, but niclosamide was found not to interfere with the virion's attachment and entry into cells, as it was still active even when added three hours after viral infection of cells. Some in silico studies suggested the potential binding of niclosamide to the SARS\u2010CoV main proteinase.22 However, only modest activity of niclosamide against this proteinase was reported (IC50=40 \u03bcm).23 Moreover, niclosamide exhibited antiviral activity against chikungunya virus (CHIKV) using a CHIKV 26S\u2010mediated insect cell fusion screening assay and was able to inhibit virus entry and cell\u2010to\u2010cell transmission of CHIKV infection.19 In light of the recent outbreak of Zika and Ebola infections, focus was on the drug repurposing screen of FDA\u2010approved drugs for rapid identification of potential therapeutic agents to meet the urgent medical need to treat these infections. Using such an approach, niclosamide was identified as an inhibitor of the Zika virus.20 Further validation assays confirmed the ability of niclosamide to significantly decrease Zika RNA levels and suppress the production of infectious Zika particles at sub\u2010micromolar concentrations.21 Subsequently, niclosamide emerged as a positive hit from another drug repurposing screen aimed at identifying clinically used agents that may have activity against the Ebola virus (EC50=1.5 \u03bcm).21\n",

In addition to this broad\u2010spectrum anticancer activity, niclosamide was also shown to inhibit cancer stem cells,35 which are considered an attractive and promising anticancer therapeutic target, as accumulating evidence has established their crucial role in cancer initiation, progression, establishment, recurrence, and drug resistance.36 Beyond its use as a single agent, niclosamide has been studied in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic agents. For instance, the combination of niclosamide with cisplatin led to the inhibition of cisplatin\u2010resistant triple\u2010negative breast cancer37 and exhibited synergistic effects in cisplatin\u2010resistant lung cancer cells.38 Enhanced sensitivity of chronic myeloid leukemia cells to dasatinib39 and that of cervical cancer cells to paclitaxel40 was also achieved when these drugs were used in combination with niclosamide. Synergistic effects with erlotinib in colon cancer,41 head and neck cancer,42 and in erlotinib\u2010resistant non\u2010small lung cancer cells32 have also been described. While the combination of niclosamide with bicalutamide led to overcoming enzalutamide\u2010 and bicalutamide\u2010resistant prostate cancer,43 the combination with abiraterone was found to be effective in treating advanced castration\u2010resistant prostate cancer.44 Furthermore, the use of niclosamide in conjunction with radiotherapy resulted in significant radiosensitizing effects in triple\u2010negative breast cancer cells45 and overcame radio\u2010resistance in lung cancer.46\n",

Also, the favorable safety profile of niclosamide in treating humans with tapeworm infection could be due to the fact that the site of action in this case is the gut and hence the drug is not absorbed to modulate various signaling cascades and cause side effects. With the newly discovered diseases for which niclosamide may have a therapeutic effect, systemic delivery maybe required and hence the safety profile of niclosamide in this case is still largely unknown.
