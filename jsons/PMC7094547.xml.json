            "text": "Vanadium, is a gray metallic element (Z = 23) of centered cubic lattice, which due to its high melting point is considered as a refractory metal. This metal is located in the first transition series of the periodic table, specifically in the 5 group (group VB). In its metallic form, has an electronic configuration of [Ar]3d34s2, being V(II), V(III), V(IV) and V(V) the most common oxidation states [1]. Vanadium is considered a relatively abundant element, in fact, in soil, water deposits and in the atmosphere; its abundance is around 0.019% [2], representing an approximately concentration of 135 mg/kg in soil [3]. It is the 5th most abundant transition metal present in the soil, exceeding the vanadium contained in the Universe by a factor of 135 times [4]. In the ocean, its approximate concentration is around 30\u201335 nM existing mainly as an ionic pair in the form of Mn+H2VO4\n\u2212 (Mn+ represents the cations dissolved in seawater), and surpassed only by molybdates (MoO4\n2\u2212) ions (around 100 nM) as the most abundant transition metal in the ocean [5]. In sweet water, for human consumption for example, the concentration of V is around 10 nM. However, in volcanic zones, the concentration of vanadium at water level is around 2.5 \u03bcM and frequently these high concentrations bring as consequence the contamination of aquifers [2]. The Geochemical characteristics of vanadium depends mainly on two factors: the oxidation state and pH. Hence, under reductive conditions the specie based on V(III) predominates, since higher oxidation states are more soluble [3]. In the human body, the concentration of vanadium is around to 0.3 \u03bcM and it remains in balance with the amount of vanadium excreted and consumed daily through food and drink intake [2].",

Initially, Rio called it erythronium (redness), due to the red color imparted to its salts by the heating [3]. However, the French Chemical Society considered that Rio had not discovered a new chemical element, but instead, he had found impure chromium, so the identification of vanadium did not occur until 1830 by Sefstrom, who isolated it from a mineral extracted in the mines of Taberg, in Sweden [3]. Vanadium owes its name to Vanadis, the Scandinavian Goddess of love, beauty and fertility, because of its multicolored compounds [1], [4].",

It can be also found in porphyrins, present for example in Venezuelan heavy and extra heavy crude oil [6]. The concentrations range of vanadium in crude oils are shown in Table 1\n, where it is obtained as VO2+-porphyrin, in its two isotopicforms 50V (0.24%) and 51V (99.76%), being the 50V slightly radioactive with a half-life (t1/2) >3.9 \u00d7 1017 years [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. The vanadium-porphyrins are formed during early diagenesis of source rocks and the relative abundance of vanadium is related to the depositional environment [8].

Nevertheless, certain vanadium compounds have been reported as irritating to mucosae and, in a prolonged exposure, may lead to complications at the pulmonary level. Generally, these pathologies do not tend to be chronic, for example, it has been reported that the LD50 of V2O5 in rats is about 23 mg kg\u22121 and vanadium-intoxication occurs particularly by the inhalation of vanadium-rich powders, where its symptoms are similar to those presented by influenza [4].",

The biological interest of vanadium lies, in its ability to participate in different processes. Mentioning a few examples, it has been found in the active site of haloperoxidases [10] and nitrogenases [11] as counter ion in DNA and RNA, in addition to the participation in the photocleavage of proteins and in insulin regulation process [12], [13], [14]. Whereas, certain vanadium compounds such as sodium vanadate and bis(maltolalo)oxovanadium(IV) have exhibited insulin-like activity [15]; other vanadium compounds have exhibited antiparasitic activity [16] and are potential antitumor agents [2], [17]. Thus, the study of vanadium and its respective compounds are of great importance in the Bioinorganic and Medicinal Inorganic Chemistry, since they allow to obtain possible therapeutic treatment for different pathologies.",

Vanadium can also be extracted by leaching with water and precipitating at pH 2\u20133 as sodium hexavanadate (Na4V6O17), obtaining a red precipitate by the addition of sulfuric acid [4]. However, most of the vanadium produced at industrial level is obtained by a modification of the McKechnie-Seybair process, it consists in reducing the V2O5 with calcium under pressure [7]. The purification of vanadium tends to be difficult since it is easily contaminated by other elements [7], [19], this process can be carried out by either calcium reduction, by iodide refining (via van Arkel-deBoer process), by thermal decomposition, by solvent extraction or by electrolytic refining of molten salts, achieving a purity of 99.95% [4], [19].",

It is used as a catalyst in many industrial processes, such as in the manufacture of ceramics, in the production of maleic anhydride by catalyzing the oxidation of butane with air, in the production of phthalic anhydride by the oxidation of o-xylene or naphthalene, and in the production of adipic acid, oxalic acid and anthraquinone [7].

In fact, since the late 1980s, there has been a great interest in the metabolic reactions of vanadium-amino acid compounds, thus, different amino acid reactions in biological systems have been catalyzed by enzymes containing pyridoxal phosphate. These enzymatic reactions have been modeled by the formation of Schiff bases, produced by the condensation between an aromatic aldehyde and the \u03b1-amino acid.

The viability of these cells was reduced by 70% at 100 \u03bcM of the vanadium species concentration in the culture medium [47]. Further studies showed that V(III)-cysteine complexes also exhibit significantly greater total antioxidant capacity, high inhibition of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) at a concentration of 10\u22123 M, and high lung prevention of lung metastasis tested in Wistar rats [48].

In ML2 species, (where M and L represents V(III) and a \u03b1-amino acid respectively), which are predominant between pH 4 and 8, l-alanine acts as a bidendate ligand through O and N atoms. With l-aspartic acid, the complexation processes showed to be more complicated. For example, up to pH \u2243 4 they are similar to those for l-alanine, but in the higher pH region, it forms mono and various dinuclear species of carboxylic or \u03bc-oxo bridges differing from each other by the number of coordinated ligands and OH\u2212 groups. Nevertheless, both V(III)-l-aspartic acid and V(III)-l-alanine complexes, have a significant apoptotic effect on Hepatoma Morris 5123 cells [49]. Complex compounds of vanadium(III) with l-histidine (His) instead, showed that solutions at pH 2\u20134.5, consecutive mononuclear species MLH, ML2H2, MLH2, ML2H4 and ML are formed, but at higher pH, mixed hydroxy- and/or oxo-species appeared in solution. At pH range of 6\u20138.5, V2OL4 species predominantly exists in solution [50]. It is important to note that, MLnHm represents different binary complexes where M is the metallic center, Ln is the n \u03b1-amino acids coordinated to vanadium and Hm is the m acidic protons of the \u03b1-amino acids which acts as a ligand.",

In this media, it is much more stable as oxidovanadium(V) (VO2+), which after some time (longer than V(III)), it is oxidized into V(V) (VO2\n+) [24]. The different species depended, as expected, on the pH of the solution and the total concentration of V(IV)O, as can be seen in Fig. 4\n. At pH lower than 6, the main species present are [VIVO(H2O)5]2+ and [VIVO(OH)]+, at pH higher than 6, the precipitate of VIVO(OH)2 is formed except at low V(IV)O concentration. A water-soluble specie [VIVO(OH)3]\u2212 is also formed at pH values from 6 to 11 [51]. However, circular dichroism, UV and EPR spectroscopy studies with solutions containing amino acids, have shown that the most predominant species between 5 \u2264 pH \u2264 12 is [(VIVO)2(OH)5]\u2212\nn, where n will depend on the total concentration of vanadium(IV), it is important to mention that, the relative abundances of the species [VIVO(OH)3]\u2212 and [(VIVO)2(OH)5]\u2212\nn will also depend on the total V(IV) oxide concentration. Nevertheless, the stability constant of the [(VIVO)2(OH)5]\u2212\nn has been difficult to determine [24], [55]. At pH > 12, the predominant species is [VIVO(OH)3]\u2212\n[54], corroborated through Optical, Raman and EPR spectroscopy. Different studies showed that the stability constant of the vanadium(IV) complexes at pH >5 is about log\u03b220-5 \u2248 \u221222.3 \u00b1 0.2, and the hydrolytic process are extensive and important even in presence of high molar ratios of the amino acid [24], [33], [55], [56].",

The in vitro results revealed that, Hb binds to V(IV)O by three unspecific sites (named \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3) and the strength of the bound VO2+-Hb is lower than V(IV)O-hTf. In this study, the systems with V(IV)O potential antidiabetic compounds [VIVO(6-mepic)2], cis-[VIVO(Pic)2(H2O)], [VIVO(acac)2] and [VIVO(dhp)2], the formation of the mixed species cis-VOL2(Hb) was detected with equatorial binding of an accessible histidine residue (when L = maltolate (maL) or 1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-pyridinonate (dhp)). Instead, with acetylacetonate (acac) the presence of ternary complexes were not observed. Experimental evidence of the uptake of [VIVO(mal)2], [VIVO(dhp)2] and [VIVO(acac)2], by red blood cells, indicates that the neutral compounds penetrate the erythrocyte membrane through passive diffusion, being found in the intracellular medium in amounts higher than 50%. Alternatively, inside the red blood cells, the compounds [VIVO(mal)2], [VIVO(dhp)2] and [VIVO(acac)2], are quantitatively transformed into cis-VIVO(dhp)2(Hb), cis-VIVO(mal)2(Hb) and cis-VIVO(mal)2(Cys-S-), with the equatorial coordination of a thiolate-S- of glutathione. [VIVO(acac)2] can be also biotransformed in the binary species (VIVO)xHb, VIVO(L1,L2) and VIVO(L3,L4), where L1, L2, L3, and L4 are red blood cell bioligands.",

The speciation in the system vanadate(V)-maltol is complex, at pH < 7, because despite vanadate(V) forms complexes at acidic pH, a reduction to V(IV)O may occur. Pettersson et al. studied this system from neutral to slightly alkaline solutions, and in blood serum at physiological pH (pH = 7.4) using potentiometry, 51V NMR and EPR [89], [91]. These experimental conditions, reduction may also occurs, although at a rather low rate, allowing a detailed study of the system and determining the speciation of the vanadate-maltol system.

In this section we will discuss the applications of vanadium compounds, especially vanadium complexes with (non)essential amino acids, in pharmacology and medical therapeutics, as well as their importance in bioinorganic chemistry. Metal compounds have been used for medicinal applications since ancient times [127]; however, the use of drugs of organic origin has governed the development of modern medical chemistry. The discovery of cisplatin, for example, and its potent anti-tumor activity [16], [128], has led many of researchers worldwide to focus on the study of inorganic medical chemistry. In fact, coordination chemistry compounds and organometallic compounds, using different metal centers, have been evaluated in cancer, endemic tropical diseases as Chagas, leishmaniasis and viral infections such as Dengue, SARS and HIV [16], [129], [130].",

However, the interest in bioinorganic vanadium chemistry became most notable in the late 1970s, when Cantley and coworkers reported on the inhibition of (Na,K)-ATPase by vanadate, disclosing biological consequences of the chemical similarities between vanadate(V) ion and phosphate [132]. The fundamental differences between vanadate(V) and phosphate is in the type of reactions in which they participate (e.g. V and/or P ester formation) and in their acid-base equilibria, at physiological pH, the vanadate(V) is mainly in its H2VO4\n\u2212 form, while phosphate is present as H2PO4\n\u2212 and HPO4\n2\u2212 in approximately equal concentration [5], [82]. Phosphate presents a transition state penta-coordinated, whereas vanadate(V) easily reaches a coordination number of five, acquiring a distorted trigonal bipyramid geometry [5], [24], [82] this cause that vanadate and other oxovanadium clusters compounds can inhibit phosphatases and phosphorylases (alkaline phosphatases, acid phosphatases, tyrosine-protein phosphatases, ribonucleases, phosphordiesterases, phosphoglucomutase and glucose-6-phosphatase) with different efficiency, and where the activity of a phosphate-dependent enzyme may be inhibited when vanadate is incorporated into the active site replacing the phosphate [3], [5], [15], [82], [83], [84], [133]. Thus, the interaction between vanadate(V) and proteins occurs through the binding of moieties similar to those formed by phosphate. One example of this interaction is the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues, where vanadate(V) also forms esters with Tyr residues mimicking their phosphorylation process [15], [82].",

These differences are meaningful because when simple geometrical calculations are done, the volume of vanadate shows an increase of 25\u201340% relative to phosphate (assuming a similar molecular geometry) [82]. It was highlighted that, for small molecules, the squared pyramidal geometry is the most common, but in presence of proteins, the trigonal bipyramidal is better supported [83]. A comparison of the molecular geometry of vanadate and phosphate relevant for several proteins is shown in Fig. 17\n.",

            "text": "Vanadate has been identified as a moiety that may bind at the active site of certain enzymes, such as proteins phosphatases. In the PTP1B (protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B), vanadium forms coordinated penta and hexa complexes involving a bidentate bond with the carboxyl group of the aspartate [5], [24]. The enzyme PTP1B plays a crucial role in the signaling of the insulin receptor, because it is a negative regulator of the pathway [134]. In fact, the antidiabetic activity of the vanadium compounds [82] is linked to the formation of a transition state stable analogue, which binds strongly to the active site of PTP1B, leading to its inhibition [135], [136]. Unlike the phosphoester, the vanadate esters bound to the active site of the enzyme, are not easily released, causing inhibition of PTP activity [24]. Lyonnet et al. (1899) observed for the first time that oral administration of Na3VO4 decreased glycosuria in diabetic patients [137]. At present, PTP1B inhibition has been proposed as the main insulin-mimetic target, and a significant number of vanadium complexes have been investigated as antidiabetic potentials. Nevertheless, by reducing V(V) to V(IV) it is possible to reverse the inhibition, and it can be reached by the presence of glutathione and/or other biological reducing agents [24]. Other important vanadium-enzyme complexes are the vanadium bromoperoxidases (VBPO) \u2013 one of these was the first enzyme discovered that use vanadium as a cofactor \u2013 and the vanadium nitrogenases (V-Nases), found in nitrogen-fixing bacteria of the genus Azotobacter (chroococcumvinelandii) [24], [82], [138], [139].",

From the most common oxidation states of vanadium, only oxidation states (III), (IV) and (V) were found to be involved in biological systems [50], since V(II) is able to reduce water to hydrogen [5], [25]. The most common oxidation states of vanadium in biological systems, especially in mammals, are V(V) (d0) and V(IV) (d1), since V(III) (d2) is very susceptible to oxidation processes. However, stable V(III)-transferrin human complexes have been found [82], [140], [141] in addition to the presence of V(III) in the final storage stage of ascidians, where the concentration of V reaches values up to 350 mM, being the V used as venom for potential predators [4], [142], [143].",

            "text": "Vanadium compounds were originally considered, for many years, as potential oral drugs for the treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus, however; with the development of insulin in 1922, the interest of metal-based drugs decreased. At the end of the 70s, the insulin-like effect of vanadium compounds in several experimental models was consolidated, among them, the stimulation of glucose transport, glycolysis and glycosynthesis, among other carbohydrates metabolism events [144], [145]. In 1985, inorganic salts such as NaVO3 and VOSO4 were considered again for the treatment of diabetes, but these inorganic salts presented several problems, such as, gastrointestinal distress and low absorption. For this reason, further studies with inorganic salts of vanadium were discarded and newer researches were made towards the complexation of V(IV)O with bidentate organic ligands such as maltolato [146], [147], [148], dmpp (1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-4-pyridinonate) [149], [150], [151] and picolinate [148], [152] with special attention for the later one, since picolinic acid is the intermediate metabolite of tryptophan and it is therefore less toxic to mammals organism promoting as well the absorption of various metals in the small intestine [153]. The chelating effect of the carrier ligand greatly influences the efficiency of the compound because determines the re-adsorption and improves the biodistribution, stability and tolerability of the metal ion in the organism [5], [24], [96]. One of the most important compounds is the bis(ethylmaltolate)oxovanadium(IV) (BEOV) from Akesis Pharmaceuticals Inc., which was suspended in phase II due to some problems despite its good clinical efficacy in patients with type 2 diabetes [90], [148]. The VIVO(dmpp)2(bis(1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-4-pyridinonate)oxovanadium (IV)) complex has exhibited antidiabetic activity increasing glucose uptake in adipocytes promoting the phosphorylation of the Akt1, a key protein in insulin signaling [149]. A chronic in vivo treatment in with VIVO(dmpp)2 decreases hyperglycemia and improves glucose tolerance [151].

Likewise, this complex decreased both triglycerides and blood fatty acids on alloxan induced diabetes rats [158]. It is worth mentioning that, one of the main undesirable consequences of inorganic vanadium intake is its effect in the lipid metabolism which is still unclear. For example, in healthy rats treated via oral with VOSO4, it has been observed an increase of total cholesterol, LDL and blood triglycerides [159]. In fact, patients with impaired glucose tolerance treated with VOSO4 showed an increment of the basal triglyceride levels from 1.35 \u00b1 0.61 to 1.70 \u00b1 0.46 mmol/L (p = 0.018) [160], so treatment with inorganic vanadium in patients should be studied more exhaustively with respect to the lipid metabolism, given that, an elevated blood levels of triglycerides and cholesterol may be associated with increased cardiovascular risk [161]. Vanadium complexes can be considered as drug delivery system presenting a better therapeutical effect than classical inorganic vanadium salts observed in \u2018in vivo\u2019 studies for the evaluation of their anti-hyperglycemic activity and also in insulin-mimetic activity performed \u2018in vitro\u2019 [155]. The insulin-mimetic effect exerted by some vanadium compounds may be attributed to the stimulation of the autophosphorylation of insulin receptors, however, this depends on the animal tissue and the species under study, for example, in rat lung cells and rabbit cells, the autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor could not be determined [162], [163], [164], [165]. On the other hand, these insulin-mimetic effect of vanadium compounds can be due the stimulation of kinases enzymes by translating signals used by insulin into the MAPKs and PI3K proteins, which are responsible for the regulation of the metabolism and mitogenic effects of insulin. Additionally, the inhibition of PTP1B due to the administration of vanadium complexes, activates the signaling of PI3K \u2192 Akt through the increment of the tyrosine phosphorylation of Ir\u03b2 and IRS of the tyrosine phosphorylation [2], [166]. Further results suggested that, in fact, the inhibition of PTPases, especially tyrosine phosphatases, is the main mechanism of their insulin-mimetic effect, being here where certain vanadium compounds behave as reversible inhibitors while other compounds perform irreversible inhibitions by modifying the protein due to redox processes [167].",

[168] showed that treatment with the vanadium and glutamate complex, Na2[V(V)O(Glu)2(CH3OH)]\u00b7H2O (1\u00b7H2O), was not only able to inhibit human PTP1B in vitro, but also other types of PTPs, such as Src homology phosphatase 1 (SHP-1), hematopoietic tyrosine phosphatase (HePTP) and T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP). The inhibitory activity was attributed to the largest complex formed at physiological pH [168]. SHP-1 has been established as a negative regulator of insulin-induced glucose metabolism. Inhibition of this phosphatase increases the glucose uptake through enhanced insulin receptor signaling [169], [170]. Only some oxovanadium(IV) complexes have shown an inhibitory effect on SHP-1, suggesting that these compounds, such as Na2[VO(Glu)2(CH3OH)] and 2-((5-Nitro-2-oxybenzylidene)amino)benzoato-diaqua-oxovanadium(IV), play an important role in enzyme selectivity [168], [171]. The bisperoxovanadium compounds has been described as inhibitor of PTEN (phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphatase) [172], [173], another important counter-regulator of insulin signaling [174], [173]. However, inhibition by vanadium complexes with amino acids has not been demonstrated.",

All this is mediated by activation of various signaling molecules such as MAPK, NF-kB and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [189], [191], [192], [193], [194]. Possibly, P53 is the key protein for these effects of vanadium compounds, since a large number of tumor cells have defects in the gene encoding this protein [195]. In case of p53-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts, vanadate inhibit the cell cycle and induce apoptosis; whereas in functional p53 cells, vanadate promote the S phase favoring proliferation [196]. The ammonium monovanadate is able to induce apoptosis in both rats with breast cancer 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene induced and MCF-7 cells culture, accompanied by a strong expression of p53 [197]. Recently, vanadium complexes such as, [VO(oda)(phen)](H2O)1.5, [phenH][VO(nta)(H2O)](H2O)0.5 or [4-NH2-2-Me(QH)][VO(nta)(H2O)](H2O) were reported to induce apoptosis of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma through a mechanism that involves ROS increase [198].",

It is noteworthy that, the inhibition of PTP1B, is carried out both by the direct union of the compounds and the post-translational modifications induced by the reactive oxygen species, the inhibitory process involves the ROS-induced oxidation of cysteine215 within the active site of PTP1B, so that it abrogates its nucleophilic function [201], [202]. The role of PTP1B in cancer has been extensively investigated, recently, it was determined that the increased expression of this enzyme contributes robustly to the development of some types of tumor, especially in breast cancer [203], [204]. Vanadium complexes such as oxodiperoxo(1,10-phenanthroline) vanadate (pVphen) [202], oxidovanadium(IV) complexes with oxodiacetate (oda) and 2,2\u2032-bipyridyl, (VO(Oda)bipy) and o-phenanthroline (VO-(oda)phen) [193], V(V)-peroxido-betaine [205], Metvan [184] as well as V(III)-l-cysteine [47], [188], have shown a close link between antitumor activity and increased production of ROS in various cancer lines. Metvan has been the most successful vanadium complex tested as antitumoral, concentrations in the range of \u03bcM have induced cell apoptosis in different tumor lines, such as leukemia cells, multiple Myeloma cells, breast, prostate, ovarian, and testicular cancer cells, demonstrating a high efficiency compared to cisplatin [2], [184], [189], [17], [206].",

It is widely known that these types of natural products have antioxidant, cytotoxic and chemosensitizing properties [207], [208]. Among the most outstanding complexes are: those of naringenin [185], morin [209] chrysin and silibinin [210]. In the late of 1990s, it was shown that some vanadium compounds also had chemopreventive effects, since chelating compounds may have a significant effect on improving the antioxidant and antitumor properties of flavonoids [2]. Aiming to this fact, the synthesize of V(IV)O with flavonoids such as Morin and Silibinin, proved in line cells MG-63 for the study of osteosarcoma, gave very promising results [209], [211], [212]. Vanadium compounds of 1,10-phenanthroline or 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives with anti-tumor properties, induced cell death by apoptosis, with IC50 values lower than cisplatin [24]. It is important to mention that, 8-hydroxyquinoline (8HQ), is a privileged structure which is present in many natural products and has been used as a pharmacophor in the design of compounds with biological activity for different types of neurodegenerative diseases and herpes [213]. 8HQ enhances the bioavailability of vanadium complexes by increasing the ability to penetrate the lipid-rich cell membrane [2].",

In fact, this amino acid vanadium complex has exhibited much greater potency than vanadylsulphate in benzo[a]pyrene-induced leiomyosarcomas in Wistar rats [180], [181]. Interestingly, solution of vanadium(III) with l-cysteine (pH approx. 7, L/M = 20) showed a cytotoxic effect in hepatoma cells, with reduced cell viability to 70% at concentrations of 100 \u00b5M of vanadium species concentration in the culture medium [47], however, the state of protonation of the cysteine coordinated to the metallic center was not reported, so it is not clear which species is responsible for the effect in this paper. It should be noted that liver cancer is considered one of the most aggressive and metastatic, and has very limited therapeutic alternatives [182]. So it has been of great importance to study new antineoplasics against this type of cancer. Vanadium (III)-l-cysteine is the main complex with amino acids with antineoplastic activity and is organovanadium with better profile in combination therapy with anticancer agents [46], [47], [180], [181], [188]. However, the biotransformation of this type of complexes and the intimate molecular mechanisms by which these biological effects are exerted are unknown. Recently, Basu et al. (2017) have established some aspects of the cellular and molecular mechanism of the vanadium(III)-l-cysteine complex on a murine model of breast cancer, where this complex showed decreased tumor volume and was able to activate proapoptotic signaling, which involves the dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, induction of Bax, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, activation of caspases 3 and 9, induction of p53 expression and DNA fragmentation, as well as inhibition of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 [188].",

Antitumor and chemosensitizing effects of this complex are accompanied by an important antiangiogenic and antimetastatic activity, V(III)-l-cysteine decreases levels of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), inducers of angiogenesis and metastasis respectively [188]. The inhibition or reduction of metalloproteinases in vitro suggests that this mechanism may be linked to the antimetastatic activity observed in vivo in the work of Papaioannou (2004) [48]. The complexes of vanadium with cysteine (including V(IV)O-l-cysteine methyl ester), are able to protect non-neoplastic cells from cyclophosphamide-induced toxicity, producing a reversal of increases ROS, nitric oxide and transaminases, as well as by enhancing the activity of antioxidant enzymes: catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in the liver of experimental animals [175], [188]. In addition, the chemoprotection of V(IV)O-l-cysteine methyl ester against cisplatin or cyclophosphamide-induced toxicity, has been established in bone marrow cells and in lymphocytes, with a decrease in the DNA fragmentation, apoptosis and chromosomal aberrations [215], [216]. Currently, it is known that these cysteine complexes exhibit protective effects on renal damage cisplatin-induced in mice, where the oxidative stress reduction and antioxidant status restoring play a critical role [176]. Fig. 20\nshows a summary of the possible mechanism of action for the antitumor activity of V(III)-l-cysteine complex.",

In the case of amino acids as ligands, they may have an additional effect of interest, such as l-cysteine which is a known chemoprotector [219], [220], or other amino acids that have been reported to produce or contribute to the antitumor effect [220]. An excellent example is represented by glycine, which has been studied for its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties, Bruns et al. (2014) show that glycine inhibits angiogenesis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells culture, through decrease VEGF-A expression [221], [222]. However, some vanadium complexes with glycine or glycinate have shown antineoplastic activity, such as vanadium N-(2-hydroxy acetophenone) glycinate, which has shown an important cytotoxic effect on human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, human colorectal carcinoma, human breast cancer, and human astrocytoma cell lines, without showing toxic effect on normal fibroblast cell line mice. Likewise, in mice with cancer induced by Ehrlich cell ascites carcinoma and Sarcoma 180 cell transplantation, this complex was able to decrease tumor survival. Although the toxicity of vanadium is well known, this vanadium complex with glycine presented low toxicity in experimental animals [223]. The differential toxicity of vanadium species, complexes and biotransformation products must be studied more thoroughly to define the mechanistic toxicology of vanadium compounds. Recently, it was shown on human colorectal carcinoma cells, that vanadium N-(2-hydroxy acetophenone) glycinate induces apoptosis by mechanisms that include mitochondrial damage, DNA damage and increased ROS [187].",

In the case of vanadium haloperoxidases, the complex is formed between vanadium and histidine. For example, vanadate(V) ions are coordinated through a histidine residue of A. nodosum bromoperoxidases. For this reason, many vanadium complexes are reported in the literature in order to simulate the mode of coordination with the histidine residue [230], [231].",

Parasites responsible of these diseases develop rapid resistance to active drugs and for this reason it is important to develop newer therapeutic arsenal against these diseases [16], [232], [233]. The inclusion of a metal center to these anti-parasitic drugs improves its pharmacological properties, the formation of metal complexes serves to modulate the activity of the possible drug [16].

In particular, [(VIVO)2(VVO)(SbW9O33)2] have exhibited antiviral activity not only against HIV-1 but also have shown in vitro activity against of influenza, dengue, fever and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [2]. This compound decomposes in vanadate(V) and tungsten(VI), which seem to be the true active species [2]. V(IV)O-porphyrin complexes have also shown inhibitory effects on HIV-1 when were evaluated on Hut/CCR5 replication cells, where all these complexes have showed anti-viral activities compared to the vehicle control [244], [245]. The effect of porphyrin on the complex, is to stabilize the metal center, which is unstable at physiological pH, additionally, it makes the complex oxidovanadium(IV)-porphyrins more soluble in aqueous media and avoids demetallization reactions [245]. One of the main goals of anti-HIV drugs is the reversal of transcriptase; the oxidovanadium(IV)-porphyrin compounds have reversed transcriptase after 30 min of incubation, when binding CD4 protein with an energy of -138.61 kcal mol\u22121\n[244] in this way preventing virus from entering the host cell [2], [245]. The activity of V(IV)O-porphyrin complex has been measured using Elisa method [244]. The chemical structures of the oxidovanadium(IV)-porphyrins complex is shown in Fig. 22\n.",

This important result was reported by Sakurai et al.

Two different methods of oral administration of vanadyl complexes were evaluated, including complexation and capsulation. The pharmacokinetic studies showed that enteric-coated capsules increase the bioavailability of active oxidovanadium species [249]. Other ways of vanadium incorporation is through the application of intravenous injections, by inhalation, etc. Vanadium compounds, once they enter into contact with the blood plasma and its components, suffer a series of ligand exchange reactions. Such compounds are mainly components of low molecular mass such as citrate and lactate or with high molecular weight ligands such as transferrin, albumin and immunoglobulin G., where changes on the oxidation state of the metal may also occur [2], [51], [52], [67], [69], [82], [96], for example, reducing agents such as ascorbate, glutathione and NADH can reduce V(V) to V(IV) or even V(III) [2], [5], while oxidizing agents such as NAD+, O2, O2\n2\u2212 and O2\u2212 can convert V(IV) to V(V) [24].",

From the bioinorganic point of vanadium, has been shown to be essential for the correct biological functioning of a limited number of organisms and enzymes, such as vanadium nitrogenases and vanadate-dependent haloperoxidases. The vanadium compounds also showed potential applications in the medical field, especially regarding to the treatment of diabetes and cancer, where the vanadium complexes with l-glutamate and with l-cysteine respectively, have established an interesting window for discovery of new drugs. Additionally, several vanadium complexes with essential and non-essential amino acids have shown a better safety profile in preclinical studies, suggesting that these compounds may be less toxic than inorganic vanadium compounds. However, the efficacy and safety of vanadium complexes as potential metallodrugs should be investigated more thoroughly. The authors of the present manuscript consider that the research area focused on vanadium chemistry will continue its development with the obtainment of new compounds with direct impact on the inorganic medicinal chemistry. The findings reported in the literature suggest that the use of amino acids and derivatives as vanadium ligands is highly promising, not only because they are biomolecules of high biochemical, physiological and nutritional value, but also because of the beneficial and therapeutic potential exerted by an important number of them.",
