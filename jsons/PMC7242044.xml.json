Interactive system development does not follow the same life cycle as software system development. The essential differences lie in the iterative nature of the interactive system development. Hence, the completion of such systems requires usually several iterations. Throughout iterations, the requirements undergo many changes due to the evolution of customer\u2019s needs and user feedback after experiencing the prototypes. Furthermore, the formalization of user interaction requirements into HCI specification is a complex task that needs a thorough observation of user behaviour. The challenge is tougher in the case of critical HCI (cockpits, medical systems, etc.). Indeed, critical HCI requires to be designed and built such that safety is put at the forefront of the requirements dictated by standards and norms.",

It is a formal method for system-level modelling and analysis. Basically, it relies on set theory and first-order logic to formalize systems into models and uses refinement to represent systems at different abstraction levels. Furthermore, it leverages mathematical proof theory for discharging proof obligations [1]. The Event-B language defines two main building blocks to model, in principle, any system: firstly, a context construct for describing the static characteristics of a system through carrier sets, constants, axioms and theorems, secondly, a machine building block for expressing the dynamic aspects through variables, invariants, theorems, variants and events. Rodin3 [2] is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Event-B modelling language based on Eclipse. It has many features making the modelling and V&V process easier and more efficient. Rodin features project management, incremental model development, proof assistance, model checking, animation and automatic code generation.",

This dual specification of requirements is a key feature of our framework addressing the HCI development process, in particular handling of storyboards.Defining and implementing transformation rules in order to dive FLUID and/or Event-B models into ICO for the sake of animation using PetShop.For the purpose of assessment and evaluation of the framework, case studies will be developed and extended to comply with the HCI domain-specific constraints. In addition, formal methods (Event-B, ICO, LIDL [5]) will be compared, on the basis of different criteria (expressivity, conciseness, etc.), to our framework through development of case studies.\n",

Next, the transformation schema needs to be formalized and implemented, allowing the translation from FLUID into Event-B and ICO. Then, in order to demonstrate the effectiveness, cases studies are planned to be developed based on the novel framework. Finally, a development process will be defined around the novel framework so to facilitate and structure HCI developments.
