            "text": "I frequently tell young prospective research students that respiratory infections are a great area to develop expertise in because unlike cancer or cardiovascular disease they can be guaranteed the problem will not be solved and go away in their lifetime. The burden of respiratory infectious disease is large, not only acutely, but also due to their chronic complications. Lower respiratory tract infections remain the number one cause of death in the developing world. 1 In the developed world, lower respiratory tract infections are still the fifth leading cause of death. 1 The increasing age of the general population in most countries, our ability to keep people from succumbing to chronic organ failure and the ever increasing array of immunosuppressant drugs being used in a variety of neoplastic and immune diseases ensure that there is an ever increasing pool of vulnerable hosts.",

While some progress has been made in reducing pneumococcal disease with the newer conjugate vaccines, 2 there is evidence that the speed of adaptation (as measured by the proportion of strains not covered by the vaccines) is increasing. [3] [4] [5] Adaptation in other pathogens is posing challenges in multiple areas including drug-resistant tuberculosis, pan-resistant Gram-negative pathogens and ever increasing rates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in many Western countries.",

Other reviews will focus on key areas such as the evidence around what is best practice in caring for patients with respiratory infections and key differences in respiratory pathogens in different areas of particular relevance to the Asia-Pacific region. I hope readers of Respirology will find these reviews a useful resource clinically and an inspiration to get involved in research as since the bugs will not stand still, neither can we!
