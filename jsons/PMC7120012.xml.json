However, the desire to remove preservatives from formulations driven by concerns over potential damage from long-term use coupled with innovations in device technology has allowed Pharma companies to consider preservative-free nasal sprays as a viable option. In this chapter, an overview of nasal cavity physiology will be presented along with a review of locally and systemically acting drug products. Current formulation and manufacturing strategies are discussed along with the device landscape that enables preservative-free formulations. Finally, the pathway for global regulatory approval will be outlined including considerations for in vitro analytical test requirements.",

At the end of the nasal vestibule, the diameter of each cavity decreases at a point called the nasal ostium (Newman 1993). The septum separates the two cavities, which extend, on average, 12\u201314 cm from the nostrils to the junction between the nose and pharynx (Vidgren and Kublik 1998; Marom et al. 1984). This junction is called the nasopharynx. The nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT), an area that may be associated with inducing mucosal immunity, is located in the nasopharynx. Within the nose itself, the main nasal passage is further divided by three projections from the septum called turbinates (Pontiroli et al. 1989). The inferior, middle, and superior turbinates increase the total surface area of the nasal cavity to 150 cm2 (Pontiroli et al. 1989). The total volume of each cavity is 7.5 mL.\n\n",

The stratified squamous and transitional types are mainly found in the anterior third of each cavity. Cells in this region are neither ciliated nor well vascularized. The columnar type, also known as respiratory epithelium, is located in the posterior two thirds. The respiratory region contains ciliated cells, mucous secreting goblet cells, and basal cells (Petruson et al. 1984). The respiratory epithelium is also highly vascularized, innervated, and drained by an extensive lymphatic network (Pontiroli et al. 1989; Schipper et al. 1991). The olfactory epithelium, which contains cells that provide a sense of smell, is located near the superior turbinate and adjacent to the nasal septum (Schipper et al. 1991). The main function of the nose is to warm and humidify inspired air and to filter inhaled, potentially toxic or infectious, particles from the airstream (Pontiroli et al. 1989). Thus, the nasal cavity primarily acts as a defense mechanism by protecting the lower respiratory tract (Andersen and Proctor 1983).",

Of these, inertial impaction is the most predominant for two main reasons. First, the air passageway constricts sharply approximately 1.5 cm into the nose at the nasal ostium (Mygind 1985). This constriction accelerates the inhaled air and increases turbulence (Yu et al. 1998). Secondly, the air stream must change direction at this constriction to enter the turbinate region. Particles that are large or moving at high velocity cannot follow the air stream as it changes direction due to their high momentum. Such particles continue in their original direction of travel and impact the airway walls, particularly at the leading edge of the turbinates. Because the drug-laden droplets for most aqueous nasal sprays are so large (30\u201360 \u03bcm) (Chien et al. 1989), a high percentage of the spray impacts in the anterior third of the nasal cavity (Hardy et al. 1985). However, droplets that are smaller than 10 \u03bcm may bypass the nasal cavity and deposit in the lower respiratory tract, which may be deemed as a risk by regulatory agencies.",

The surface area/body weight ratios for the animals above range from 7.7 to 46 cm2/kg except for sheep that have a ratio of 0.2 cm2/kg (Illum 2000). In addition, animal\u2019s nasal cavities are structurally different than man because they lack a third turbinate. To deliver nasal sprays into the nose of many of these animals, the animal needs to be anesthetized or sedated, which also can affect drug absorption. In short, animal models produce absorption results that fail to accurately predict the results in man (Illum 2000).",

A review of BAC (Marple et al. 2004) studies suggest that BAC may cause changes to ciliary beat frequency, ciliary morphology, mucociliary clearance or may potentially damage the epithelial lining. However, after assessing all the literature, the reviewers concluded that BAC is safe to use in nasal spray formulations. A more thorough discussion of use of BAC in formulations is presented later in this chapter (Sect. 5.4).",

Since the drops covered a larger surface area, it seems logical that the drops would have elicited a greater response. In fact, the opposite was true. The drops were cleared faster by mucociliary clearance since they deposited in posterior regions of the nasal cavity (where cilia move the mucus layer faster). The spray was retained longer, allowing more time for absorption of desmopressin to occur (Table 5.1). The levels of factor VIII in the blood in response to delivery of desmopressin were significantly greater after administration with the spray compared to the drops.\n",

Nasal aerosols (Newman et al. 1987b) that utilize propellants to generate the spray have been shown to have smaller droplets compared to conventional nasal sprays. However, the deposition pattern is even more localized because of the exit velocity of the plume. The droplets cannot make the bend in the nasal airway and deposit in the front of the nose.

The drug formulation is prepared under sterile conditions where no preservative is added or the product can be terminally sterilized. If the product is not sterile, then the finished product is generally subjected to radiation to ensure inactivation of microbial contamination (if any) after filling. A detailed description of sterile manufacture is discussed in Sect. 5.6.Selection of a preservative-free device: After manufacturing the formulation under sterile conditions, these devices (discussed in Sect. 5.5) require no preservatives. Several companies also manufacture preservative-free pumps for multi-dose formulations. The special tip seal and filter in these pumps reduce microbial growth upon repeated use. Another type of device platform, called \u201cBag-on-Valve\u201d (BOV), also supports preservative-free formulations, as discussed in Sect. 5.5.1.3.\n",

A spring-loaded valve is located directly below the opening of the tip orifice, not allowing any microbes to migrate from any surfaces or contacted liquids into the system, sealing the orifice under resting conditions. The tip seal keeps the system closed until a defined pressure (for sprays it is more than 3 bar) is reached by actuating the system. Once a defined pressure is reached, the system opens and formulation is forced through the orifice at a higher pressure than needed to open the valve. When the pressure drops at the end of the actuation, the tip seal immediately closes the orifice with an outward movement. Therefore, no backflow of potentially contaminated medication or other liquid is possible.

To avoid contamination of the formulation via venting air, different technical solutions are used. The simplest way is sterile filtration of the venting air via separate filters or filter gaskets. For oxygen-sensitive formulations, the so-called collapsing bags or depressed systems are used. The formulation is filled in a special, microbial tight bag which is protected by a surrounding bottle. When dispensing the product, the bag collapses with the content not coming in contact with the ambient air. Some pumps are constructed in such a way that the entire system is air-tight and during use some vacuum (up to \u2212300 mbar) is generated within the bottle. Those systems allow even a purging with inert gases to reduce oxygen content in the container headspace.",

Some of the advantages of dry powder drug delivery systems include formulation stability, a system that is propellant-free, and that less coordination between actuation and inhalation is required (Telko and Hickey 2005; Serra-Batlles et al. 2002). Also, because of the absence of moisture in the dry powder system, microbial growth is minimized or eliminated, and the use of preservatives is less critical than in the case of liquid formulations. Deposition efficiency, dose uniformity, complexity of manufacturing, and device to device performance remain as concerns for dry powder technology (Chan 2006; Islam and Gladki 2008).",

With rapid prototyping techniques, nasal casts can be machined for use in a lab setting. These casts are typically coated with a material to simulate the mucus layer and to prevent particle bounce.

These tests are performed from the analysis of a two-dimensional image of the emitted plume. Traditionally spray pattern and plume geometry have been performed with impaction systems such as TLC plates and fast speed cameras. Nowadays, spray pattern and plume geometry analyses are mostly performed using non-impaction laser sheet-based instruments. Spray pattern is characterized by the D\nmax, D\nmin, ovality ratio, and area. D\nmax is the longest diameter measured on the resulting spray pattern image. D\nmin is the shortest diameter measured on the resulting spray pattern image. Ovality ratio is the ratio of D\nmax to D\nmin. This ratio provides a quantitative value for the overall shape of the spray. The spray pattern area is automatically detected by the software. Percent area is the ratio of the spray pattern area to the entire image area. Plume geometry is characterized by the plume height, spray angle, and plume width. Spray angle is the angle of the emitted plume measured from the vertex of the spray cone and spray nozzle. Plume width is the width of the plume at a given distance (e.g., 3 cm) from the spray nozzle. Plume height is the height of the emitted plume measured from the tip of the device. While specifications may be set for all spray pattern parameters, FDA recommends using area and ovality ratio for statistical comparison (Food and Drug Administration 2003) to establish bioequivalence between test and reference nasal drug products. In case of plume geometry, FDA recommends using spray angle and plume width for statistical comparison (Food and Drug Administration 2003).\n\n",

The droplet size distribution is characterized by the volume distribution (Dv10, Dv50, and Dv90), span, and percentage (%) less than 10 \u03bcm. Dv50 is the volume median diameter. It indicates that 50 % of the distribution is contained in droplets that are smaller than this value while the other half is contained in droplets that are larger than this value. Similarly the Dv10 and Dv90 values indicate that 10 % and 90 %, respectively, of the distribution are contained in droplets that are smaller than these values. Span is calculated by the following equation: (Dv90 \u2212 Dv10/Dv50) and quantifies the spread of the droplet size distribution. Percentage (%) less than 10 \u03bcm is the cumulative volume of the particles with size less than 10 \u03bcm. This cumulative fraction provides a risk estimate of particles from nasal spray that may be inhaled into lung. For bioequivalence assessment, FDA recommends using Dv50 and span for statistical comparison (Food and Drug Administration 2003) to establish bioequivalence between test and reference nasal drug products. Droplet size is also a quality control test.",

Small droplets defined as droplets smaller in size than the nominal effective cutoff diameter of the top stage of the cascade impactor may potentially be delivered to regions of the airways beyond the nose which may be a safety issue. The amount of drug in small particles is typically measured by an Andersen Cascade Impactor (ACI) operated by drawing the sample laden air through the ACI at 28.3 L/min. ACI is made up of classification stages consisting of a series of jets and impaction surfaces. At each stage, an aerosol stream passes through the jets and impacts upon the surface. Particles in the aerosol stream with significant inertia will settle upon the impaction plate. Smaller particles pass as aerosols on to the next jet stage. By designing the following consecutive stages with higher aerosol jet velocities, smaller diameter particles are collected at each subsequent stage giving the cascade affect of separation. The ACI is assembled to a 2 L glass nasal induction port and a pre-separator. Aerosol collected in the induction port, pre-separator, and the impactor is analyzed using HPLC to quantify the mass of drug. The amount and % of drug less than 9 \u03bcm and the mass balance are reported.

Leachables, which may be seen as a potential contaminate and harmful to public health, are also on the radar of the CFDA. To address, an extractable study is required to determine if potential components from the device may leach into the drug product. If the extractable profile reveals entities above the analytical evaluation threshold (AET) that require monitoring, a leachable study is necessary. For practical and financial reasons this study should take place concurrently with your registration stability batches because units can be stored for both studies at the same time under the same conditions. In order to have sufficient planning time for the leachable study, you will need to complete the extractable profile at least 6 months prior to the scheduled start of registration stability studies.",

Health Canada and EMA have a similar approach. However, the similarities may end there. In the United States, the FDA expects that the patient has the same experience when using the device. In other words, there is a need to have the same type of device, e.g., CPS pump to CPS pump, used for the RLD and generic. In Brazil, the regulatory bodies allow omission or alternate excipients for generic drug products. For example, Budecort (budesonide, RLD) is available on the market as a preserved multi-dose nasal spray and a generic budesonide formulation that is non-preserved is also on the market. This Brazilian example would not meet FDA\u2019s expectations of a generic drug product because it is not Q and Q from a formulation and device standpoint.",
