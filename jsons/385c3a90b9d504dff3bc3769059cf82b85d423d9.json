The seafood market has since been closed, but purportedly sold a variety of live animal species. On 5 January 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a document outlining their request for more information from Chinese public health authorities, and detailed 44 patients had 'pneumonia of unknown aetiology', with 121 close contacts under surveillance (www.who.int/csr/don/ 05-january-2020-pneumonia-of-unkown-cause-china/en/). The WHO reported that 11 patients were severely ill, and many affected individuals had contact with the Huanan Seafood market. Some patients were reported to have fever, dyspnea and pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography. At the time of publication, limited information has been produced directly by Chinese public health authorities; however, media reports documenting interviews with such authorities have stated that the aetiology is not yet identified, that there are now 59 affected patients, and that severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), avian influenza and several other common respiratory pathogens have been ruled out (http://news. hebei.com.cn/system/2020/01/05/100154729.shtml). On 8 January 2019, news outlets and ProMED-mail reported that genetic sequencing demonstrated a novel coronavirus as the potential causative organism. 2 Given the recent history of zoonotic transmission of a coronavirus emerging from a live-animal market in China in 2002, and the potential for novel pathogens to rapidly spread globally via commercial air travel, 3,4 we sought to evaluate international travel patterns from Wuhan, China in order to anticipate patterns of disease dispersion should this outbreak evolve.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 174, "end": 175, "text": "1", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1681, "end": 1682, "text": "2", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "We evaluated 2018 travel data generated from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to quantify passenger volumes originating from the international airport in Wuhan, China, between January and March, inclusive. IATA data accounts for \u223c90% of passenger travel itineraries on commercial flights, excluding transportation via unscheduled charter flights (the remainder is modelled using market intelligence). These data represent direct origin (Wuhan) to destination trips, and indirect trips that originated in Wuhan, but had connecting flights to a final destination. We also report Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI) scores for countries receiving significant numbers of travellers from Wuhan. 5 The IDVI score is a validated tool to estimate a country's capacity to prepare for and manage infectious disease threats. The score is based on metrics from the following seven domains: demographic, health care, public health, disease dynamics, political (domestic), political (international) and economic. Countries are scored between 0 and 1 with higher scores representing greater capacity to respond to outbreaks. 5 Table 1 outlines the top 20 destination cities with passengers arriving from Wuhan, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei received the largest volumes with 41 080, 23 707, 20 001 and 17 645 arrivals between January and March, respectively. The IDVI for these leading destinations all exceed 0.65. Sydney and Victoria, Australia and Dubai, UAE are the only three cities in the top 20 destinations that are outside of Asia.

Public health agencies around the world are reminding frontline healthcare providers to be vigilant for potential imported cases; however, this may be complicated in the northern hemisphere by high levels of influenza-like illnesses at this time of year.
