Contemporary conflicts such as those in Syria, Yemen, and Libya are characterized by protracted fighting in civilian centers and have been refractory to typical de-escalation strategies [4]. Substantial loss of civilian lives has resulted, both directly by violence and indirectly by incapacitation of fragile civil, safety, and health infrastructure [5\u20138]. During active conflict, organized health systems often break down or become impaired, leaving wounded civilians to rely on care provided by an uncoordinated, ad hoc patchwork of actors including local hospitals and international humanitarian non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are rarely able to meet the needs of affected populations [9].",

However, planning and maintaining trauma systems requires an understanding of target population needs as well as resource constraints. Advances in military and civilian trauma care have been possible largely because of quality improvement programs that rely on systematic data collection [12, 13]. However, in contrast to data regarding wartime injuries among US, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and coalition military personnel detailed by the Department of Defense Trauma Registry (DODTR), the epidemiology of injuries sustained by civilians and local combatants is incompletely understood. Injury patterns among these individuals have not been systematically characterized, and currently available data are inadequate to inform the planning and organization of trauma systems capable of addressing the unmet needs of this population [14\u201316].",

While some humanitarian health agencies maintain their own repositories of patient data, this information is not collected using a standardized data dictionary and is often inaccessible to outside agencies [28, 29]. Although it may not be reasonable to expect stressed local health facilities to engage in a centralized trauma registry, humanitarian NGOs and contracted medical providers operating in conflict settings should participate in shared data collection. The protection of patient security is of utmost importance, and any framework for sharing de-identified data with the objective of improving the quality of humanitarian response must be implemented with strict privacy safeguards.",

A landmark military study querying the Joint Theater Trauma Registry to identify causes of preventable death prompted changes in combat casualty care that reduced mortality to its lowest in any theater of war [30, 31]. No equivalent registry exists in the humanitarian sector. As a result, adequate data do not currently exist to guide efforts to improve the quality of humanitarian care in conflict. The World Health Organization and Global Alliance for Care of the Injured are currently working to produce a minimum trauma dataset to facilitate the implementation of trauma registries in countries of all economic categories, including low-resourced humanitarian contexts [32].",

This finding is consistent with previously published reports. During the 2016\u20132017 Mosul offensive, 46% of patients treated at a trauma center in Erbil were civilians [33]. During the active phase of OEF, civilians accounted for nearly 34% of combat casualties treated by one forward surgical team (FST) compared to approximately 26% coalition forces [34]. Moreover, pediatric patients sustain a substantial proportion of conflict-related injuries. Between 2011 and 2016, more than a quarter of Syrian barrel bomb victims were children [1]. During a 2017 offensive, over 40% of patients treated at an MSF hospital in Syria were under the age of 18 years [35].

Blast injuries also accounted for 90% of injuries treated at \u201cmultiple/unknown\u201d facility types, which may represent urban populations given that over 14,000 patients were described by 8 reports in this category. Indiscriminate shelling and the use of barrel bombs in densely populated urban areas severely impact civilian populations [1, 37]. For example, 90% of injuries among civilians wounded during the ISIL occupation of Mosul were caused by blast injuries and shelling [5]. Between 2011 and 2016, approximately 97% of all barrel bomb deaths in Syria were civilians, compared to only 3% combatants [1]. In contrast, the high proportion of rural injuries caused by blast mechanisms may be attributable to the prevalence of landmines and improvised explosive devices [38\u201341]. Though rural and urban trauma patients have been compared in non-conflict settings, differences between patients in rural and urban conflict settings have not been systematically characterized [42]. These differences may have implications for context-specific planning of humanitarian response and merit further research.",

The management of blast injuries is complex and requires multidisciplinary care [44\u201346]. Understanding the needs unique to blast injuries is critical to prepare training and resourcing efforts for facilities providing care in conflict settings. Whereas the decreased prevalence of thoracoabdominal trauma among US and NATO military service members has been attributed to improvements in body armor, the prevalence of extremity injuries among patients in our sample may be due to survivorship bias [15]. Given civilians\u2019 reliance on ad hoc transport with prolonged transport times, patients with significant thoracic and abdominopelvic trauma are unlikely to present alive for care. Previous reports, including data from civilian casualties treated during the 2016\u20132017 Mosul offensive, observed a similarly low (7%) rate of thoracic trauma [33]. The low prevalence of thoracoabdominal injuries in our sample suggests that in the current state, most truncal injuries are non-survivable. To decrease pre-hospital mortality, rapid transport times should be prioritized, as well as systems innovations to move the first point of care as far forward as the security environment permits [47, 48]. To address this gap, the Stanford Humanitarian Surgical Response in Conflict Working Group recently presented a consensus- and evidence-based humanitarian response to minimize preventable death and disability in conflict settings [49].",

First, the lack of reports detailing specific data elements and the heterogeneity of variables presented limited pooled analysis and prevented us from drawing conclusions regarding many data elements of interest. Second, conflicts in the Middle East constituted 75.5% of reports and nearly 85% of patients in our analysis. Conflicts from other geographic regions may be characterized by different warfare tactics and injury epidemiologies. Third, though we utilized an objective method to classify conflict settings, health facilities located in urban or semi-urban areas may receive patients from large catchment areas, representing a more rural population. Lastly, while our search strategy included terms to capture reports that detailed injuries of local combatants, few reports described this population. Despite these limitations, the findings may be used to advocate for a minimum trauma dataset in conflict and humanitarian settings and highlight important epidemiological characteristics of civilians and local combatants injured in conflict.",
