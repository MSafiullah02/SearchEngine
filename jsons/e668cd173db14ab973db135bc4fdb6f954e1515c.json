The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified criteria associated with risk of severe complications from COVID-19 infection (Appendix Table 1 ). 1 Structural inequities have shaped racial, ethnic, and income disparities for many of these criteria. To date, there has been limited analysis of the proportion of the population at risk in the U.S. based on these criteria, 2 or risk factors by race/ethnicity or income. Preliminary national data on cases by race/ethnicity suggest that disparities in hospitalization are already developing. 3 Quantifying disparities in risk is important for allocating resources to prevent, identify, and treat COVID-19-related severe illness and limit diverging outcomes for already vulnerable subgroups.",

In each age group, the proportion with more than one risk factor was also estimated, recognizing the potential for compounding risk. Prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% CIs were estimated for race/ethnicity and income group using Poisson regression models with robust SEs. The authors excluded those who responded don't know/not sure or refused, or had missing data for any risk factor except pregnancy (Appendix Tables 1 and 2) .",
