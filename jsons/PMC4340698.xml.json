Using a Boolean combination of keywords and medical subject headings (Appendix 1), we conducted separate searches to capture adherence rates of HH during routine patient care, adherence rates of aseptic technique during the placement of central venous catheters and urinary catheters, adherence rates to urinary catheter insertion guidelines, and rates of equipment contamination. We selected these procedures because they are more likely to increase the risk of infection when compared with less invasive procedures such as peripheral intravenous catheter insertion. Articles were excluded if they concerned the contamination of cultures; described self-reported compliance; did not separate ED data from other areas under study; were review articles; and were commentaries, editorials, or discussions of the issue (ie, not data based). We also excluded studies that examined compliance during outbreaks or pandemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome or emergency situations because we were interested in standard practices during routine care.",

            "text": "Four papers described equipment contamination in the ED; of primary focus was contamination with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In one large ED from a United States tertiary care hospital, 7% (5/69) of environmental surfaces (chairs, keyboards, telephones, and others) were positive for MRSA compared with no positive sites (0/63) in an outpatient clinic.34 Another research team35 took 63 samples of computer mice in an ED in Northern Ireland over a 1-year period and found only normal skin flora, with no MRSA. In a United States ED, Frazee et al36 took surveillance cultures of ultrasonographic probes used in the ED; approximately two thirds (111/164) were contaminated with skin or environmental flora, 8 samples had heavy growth of skin or environmental flora, and 3.7% (6/164) grew organisms including methicillin-sensitive S aureus, Aspergillus, Acinetobacter spp, and mixed gram-negative rods. Finally, Tang et al37 cultured the stethoscopes of ED nurses and physicians in 3 Canadian EDs. Of the 100 stethoscopes samples, 70% were contaminated. A majority of specimens grew coagulase-negative staphylococci (54/100).",

In this small but growing body of literature, there are several lessons to be learned and gaps to be filled. Whereas there were a number of papers that reported HH practices, there was a wide range in reported rates, from 7.7% to 89.7%. Unfortunately, it is not possible to draw conclusions from the data because the methods of observation varied widely. In one study, the definition of a HH indication was prior to patient contact; in another, prior to a \u201cdirty contact\u201d; and other studies adopted or adapted the WHO \u201cFive Moments of HH.\u201d16 Because the WHO observational methods were first published in 2007 and are becoming the state of the art for HH observation, it is likely that future studies using direct observation to assess HH practices will be more standardized, making it possible for the first time to compare across sites. Even more promising are newer methods of electronic monitoring of HH, which avoid the problem of the \u201cHawthorne effect\u201d and observer bias, are nonintrusive, and are much more likely to provide a real-time accurate picture of HH practices.38\n",

Despite this, data show that the ED is a common source of urinary catheterization and that guidelines for when a catheter is indicated are often not followed. Guidelines to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infections have been consistently published for decades.39 Nevertheless, in a survey of 415 US intensive care units, Conway et al40 found that only a small proportion actually had policies consistent with these guidelines and concluded that little attention is currently being paid to the prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections.",

Many of these studies are detailed in a recent systematic review, where authors conclude that ED-placed central venous catheters are a source of infection.7 Notably, few studies included in this review detailed compliance with infection prevention protocols during ED central line insertion. Future research should examine the adoption of best practices aimed to prevent infection in the ED. Similarly, whereas several studies examined environmental or equipment contamination in the ED, future studies should focus on critical items likely to come in direct contact with patients. Such was the case in the study reporting contamination of ultrasonographic probes ready for patient use,36 but studies of computer keyboards or other less critical items generally yield predictable results that add little new information.",

Clearly, it is possible that studies were missed. Additionally, studies cited were conducted in several countries that certainly vary in terms of culture and services provided (eg, levels of care, local guidelines and standards, and skills and workloads of staff). Nevertheless, several recommendations can be made. First, if infection prevention practices are to be observed or monitored, standardized methods and definitions are essential so that results can be compared across settings. Second, more efforts are needed to reduce unnecessary urinary catheterization in the ED (as well as in other clinical settings), and interventions to improve adherence to guidelines may include staff review and reminders regarding practice. Third, environmental sampling should be targeted to critical equipment and surfaces likely to contaminate patients. Finally, studies are needed to examine the impact of infection prevention practices in the ED on subsequent risk of infection.",
