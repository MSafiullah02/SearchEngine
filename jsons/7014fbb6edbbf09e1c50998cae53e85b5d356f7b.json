            "text": "Background: Cough is one of common symptoms of influenza, the cough duration and prevalence of postinfectious cough (PIC) after viral upper respiratory tract infection has not been well described. Objectives: We aim to investigate the duration of cough and prevalence of PIC and its relation with acute symptoms, airway inflammation and cough sensitivity in patients with H1N1 influenza. Methods: Patients with acute symptoms of H1N1 influenza were enrolled and followed up until cough relived. Spirometry, induced sputum test, capsaicin challenge test were conducted in patients with PIC. Cough sensitivity was presented as logarithm of provocative concentration inducing five or more coughs (logC5). Results: A total of 141 cases with H1N1 influenza were enrolled. In patients with H1N1 influenza, 97.2% of them complained cough. The duration of cough was as following: <1 week (73.0%); 1-2 weeks (7.8%); 2-3 weeks (7.8%); 3 weeks (8.5%). Twelve (8.5%) patients had cough lasting more than 3 weeks (PIC), 4 (2.8%) patients developed chronic cough (>8 weeks). Acute symptoms, spirometry, bronchial responsiveness and sputum differential cell count were similar between patients with PIC and those without PIC, however, there was a higher prevalence of previous PIC (58.3% vs 14.7%, P < 0.05) and elevated cough sensitivity (lgC5: 1.18 6 0.58 vs 2.73 6 0.33, P < 0.01) in patients with PIC as compared with the patients without PIC. Conclusions: Acute cough is common in patients with H1N1 PIC, only a few of patients develop chronic cough. Acute symptoms cannot predict PIC which is related with previous PIC and increased cough sensitivity.",

            "text": "Acute upper respiratory tract infections, such as influenza, are one of the most common illnesses. Cough and fever are typical symptoms of influenza, and often self-limited. Postinfectious cough (PIC) is considered if a cough persists more than 3 weeks after acute symptoms disappear. PIC is the most common cause of subacute cough (1, 2) , and occurs in approximately 11%-25% patients with upper respiratory tract infections, but no evidence of pathogen were shown in these studies (3, 4) . During outbreaks of Mycoplasmal pneumoniae and Bordetella pertussis infection, the prevalence of PIC in children ranged from 25% to 50% (5) , and pertussis infection is not uncommon in adults with persistent cough (6) . Based on our clinical experience, some patients might develop chronic cough. The pathogenesis of PIC is unknown. It might be because of epithelial damage, airway inflammation with or without transient bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR). Cough reflex sensitivity increased in acute phase, and down to baseline during recovery phase (7, 8) . It is uncertain whether the patients with PIC had more severe acute symptoms, airway inflammation and higher cough reflex sensitivity. Although influenza virus is the most common pathogen of upper respiratory tract infections, the duration of cough as well as the prevalence of PIC has been rarely investigated. In 2009, an influenza pandemic caused by a novel strain of H1N1 influenza occurred in China, the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of H1N1 have been widely reported (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . However, duration of cough has not been well described. We hypothesized that the prevalence of PIC might be low in patients with H1N1 influenza, while acute symptoms in greater severity, airway inflammation and higher cough sensitivity might be observed in those patients. This study aimed to investigate the duration of cough, prevalence of PIC and associated risk factors in patients with H1N1 influenza.",

            "text": "The present study was conducted during the outbreak of 2009 H1N1 influenza. All patients with fever should attend fever clinic in hospital, according to the policy of China Health Ministry. Therefore, all patients with H1N1 influenza in this study had fever. Apart from fever, cough was also the most common symptom (97.2%), which was higher than that in other report (9, 19) . Cao et al. revealed that cough occurred in 67.4% patients infected with the 2009 H1N1 influenza-A (9) . Acute upper respiratory tract infectious disease is often self-limited, cough could relieve spontaneously within 3 weeks (20) . By monitoring the time-course of pathogens via fluorescent PCR, Cao reported that the time window for virus clearance was <1 week in most patients; however, in a few patients virus still could be detected on day 17 after the onset of infection (9) . In the present study, we found that acute symptoms other than cough lasted for no more than 1 week. This result was in line with the time window for virus clearance reported by Cao et al. (9) . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study concerning cough duration following H1N1 virus infection. We found that cough lasted for no more than 1 week in most patients, only a few patients developed subacute cough, even chronic cough. When patients with subacute cough, normal chest X-ray and lung function and lack of obvious chronic airway diseases had subacute cough, PIC should be considered. The prevalence of PIC was not increased in present study. We exclusively observed the prevalence of PIC in patients with H1N1 influenza, which may be different from other virus infections. Some retrospective studies revealed that the incidence of post respiratory tract infectious cough ranged from 11% to 25% (3, 4) , but pathogens were not specified in these studies. The incidence of prolonged cough following B. pertussis infection was as high as 25%-50% (5) . The subjects included infants, young children and preschool children, the definition of prolonged cough varied from 1 to 8 weeks in these studies. Children was more susceptible to atypical pathogen infection than adults, this may explain the higher incidence of PIC in these studies than our study. In addition, low pathogenicity of H1N1 virus could partly explain the lower incidence of PIC in our study. However, Ryan reported that the incidence of PIC was as high as 43% in patients with H1N1 in Australia (21) . We postulated that difference in prevalence of PIC between our study and study by Ryan et al. might result from the inconsistency of the study design. In Ryan's study, the subjects with confirmed H1N1 influenza at least 8 weeks before were asked to complete a symptoms questionnaire, which may result in higher proportion of subjects with cough being enrolled. While in our study, almost all patients with H1N1 influenza stick to follow-ups from acute phase to recovery phase and went through the clinical tests if cough lasted for more than 3 weeks. Since only one patient had medication history of antiviral drugs in our study, it is unclear whether antiviral therapy could reduce the occurrence of PIC. For the first time, we investigated the relationship between acute symptoms and the onset of PIC. We noticed that the degree of fever and incidence of acute symptoms were similar between patients with and without PIC, which indicated acute symptoms could not predict the occurrence of PIC. We found that many patients with prolonged cough reported a previous history of PIC, as well as heightened cough sensitivity, which suggested the occurrence of PIC may be associated with the variation of cough sensitivity between individuals. The pathogenesis of PIC remains unclear. Airway mucosa injury, airway inflammation, BHR and heightened cough sensitivity caused by viral infection might contribute to the onset of PIC (7, 22, 23) . The transient enhancement of cough sensitivity was observed in patients with upper respiratory infection, and then back to normal after acute phase in previous studies (7, 8) . Ryan et al. reported that cough sensitivity was three to ninefold greater in patients with post H1N1 infectious cough than patients without PIC and healthy subjects (21) . Similarly, heightened cough sensitivity in patients with PIC was observed in our study as well. However, we did not measure the cough sensitivity during acute phase, the dynamic change of cough sensitivity could not be identified in the current study. We originally expected that heightened cough sensitiv-ity could be observed in all patients, and then back to normal in patients without PIC, but become persist in patients with PIC. We think that PIC could be explained neither by BHR, nor the level of airway inflammation, as they seemed irrelevant to PIC. Influenza may result in extensive shedding of epithelial cells closed to the basement membrane in lower airway, the exposure of subepithelial nerve endings, and release of neuropeptide might be an important mechanism of cough hypersensitivity (24) . Little et al. found that non-pneumonitic influenza infection was associated with transient bronchial hyperreactivity (23) . According to the results of our study and Ryan's study, the pathogenesis of PIC was not related with BHR.",
