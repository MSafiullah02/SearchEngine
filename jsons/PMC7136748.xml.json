Common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, dyspnoea and malaise. The disease is thought to spread via respiratory droplets among persons in close contact and possibly from contaminated surfaces [2]. Reports have also suggested that the virus can cause conjunctivitis and may be transmitted by aerosol contact with conjunctiva [3]. Ophthalmology practitioners may be susceptible to infection due to close patient proximity during slit lamp examination and the potential contamination of instruments [4].",

There was also a free text option for additional comments. A total of 100 practitioners completed the survey comprising doctors (80%), optometrists (11%), nurses (8%) and healthcare assistants (1%). Eighty percent of respondents felt at high risk of COVID-19 transmission at work, 12% did not and 8% were not sure. Most respondents felt published guidelines were not sufficient for identifying patients with or at risk of COVID-19 (Fig. 1). Respondents generally had poor confidence in guidelines which did not require ophthalmology practitioners in A&E to routinely wear PPE, and the majority had not had training in its use. There was a lack of understanding of recommended PPE for close patient contact with possible cases (Fig. 2). Several respondents raised concerns about the very close proximity of 20\u201330 cm to patients during slit lamp examinations and the need for effective triage for non-urgent eye problems. One respondent raised concerns about the lack of guidance for managing patients presenting to standalone eye units with suspected COVID-19 requiring emergency ophthalmic surgery.",

            "text": "Our survey demonstrates a lack of confidence in and understanding of COVID-19 PHE guidance amongst ophthalmic practitioners, together with significant anxiety regarding exposure risk in the ophthalmic setting. Reflecting this, standalone eye hospitals have started to introduce their own protective equipment measures outside of PHE and RCOphth guidance such as acetate slit lamp screens and FFP3 respirators for all clinical staff in A&E. This lack of coordination amongst units risks generating further confusion for staff and patients. Given the rapidly evolving situation, effective dissemination of and adherence to regularly updated PHE guidelines is prudent to instil confidence amongst practitioners and to ensure a co-ordinated evidence-based response across the ophthalmic workforce. Revisiting strategies applied within the ophthalmic setting during previous novel coronavirus outbreaks such as SARS-CoV may well reduce transmission and save lives [5].",
