For medical, biomedical, epidemiological research, article 8 of the above-mentioned ethics rules states that data subjects/patients should be able to distinguish through proper information data flows for healthcare purposes and data flows for research purposes, but consent seems to be maintained as the principal legal basis to process data. This might be misled if it is not compared with article 110 of the Privacy Code Legislative Decree n. 196/2003, as amended by the Legislative Decree 101/2018, a higher ranking rule. 13 It states, in fact, that consent it is not necessary if the legal basis is article 9, para 2, sub j) and a data protection impact assessment has been performed and published.

Furthermore, according to the mentioned article, the consent is not required whether there is a positive approval from an ethical committee and a prior consultation before the data protection authority has been performed. Also this exception may create some practical issues if we consider that data protection is an ethical profile that an ethical committee should face in its opinion. The relationship between data protection compliance and ethical compliance is, again, recalled within the article 8 of the ethics rules. Its para 4, indeed, states that the informed consent under the Oviedo Convention and Helsinki Declaration shall include information about incidental findings, while in the previous paragraphs the topic was the legal basis for data processing.
