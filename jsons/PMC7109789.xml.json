However, failure of the immune system due to illness and/or the use of immunosupressors and other therapeutic drugs can increase the patient's susceptibility to infections. Moreover, the use of antibiotics can inadvertently select antibiotic-resistant microorganisms.21",

Deadly pathogens can survive for long periods of time on hospital surfaces, making the environment a continuous reservoir of infectious agents. The adhesion of pathogens to a surface followed by biofilm formation in <24 h is a critical microbiological problem for healthcare services.10 In fact, the concentration of disinfectants required to kill sessile bacteria may be 1000-fold higher than that required to kill planktonic bacteria of the same strain. Thus, antimicrobial therapies fail to kill biofilms most of the time.27\u201330 Furthermore, there are few prevention techniques to control biofilm formation without causing side effects.31",

Some investigations have proposed that Gram-negative bacteria persist longer than Gram-positive bacteria and, although it has been suggested that the type of surface does not influence the period of persistence, it has also been shown that longer persistence may occur on plastic or even on steel.32,36 In terms of environmental conditions, lower temperatures (4\u20136\u00b0C) and high humidity (>70%) improved the persistence of several bacteria, fungi and viruses.32 Moreover, the frequency of contamination has been shown to vary depending on the body sites at which patients are colonized or infected. It was demonstrated that 36% of surfaces sampled in the rooms of patients with MRSA in a wound or urine were contaminated, compared with 6% of surfaces in the rooms of patients infected with MRSA at other body sites.37",

Drees et al.41 demonstrated an increase in VRE infection risk for an occupant of a room where a patient with this infection was previously treated. It was also demonstrated that nosocomial transmission of norovirus, C. difficile and Acinetobacter spp. was correlated with contaminated environmental surfaces.15 In another study, a positive and measurable effect on the clinical environment was demonstrated with the introduction of one extra cleaner, which apparently protected the patients against MRSA infection.42 The potential for contaminated environmental surfaces to contribute to pathogen transmission depends on two important factors: the pathogens must survive on dry surfaces and the contamination has to occur on surfaces commonly touched by patients and healthcare staff at a sufficiently high level to enable transmission to patients.35 Moreover, pathogen transmission will also depend on the infectious dose and route of transmission, along with host susceptibility.",

Medical devices, including stethoscopes and otoscopes, are highly prone to be contaminated with bacteria and have been implicated as potential vectors of cross-transmission.46 Moreover, bacteria were found on various plastic items in the hospital, including pagers and cell phones.47 Cotterill et al.48 provided suggestive evidence that contaminated ventilation grills were sources of MRSA outbreaks in hospitals. Additionally, an estimated 20%\u201340% of HAIs have been attributed to cross-infection via the hands of healthcare personnel, who have become contaminated from direct contact with the patient or indirectly by touching contaminated environmental surfaces.15,38 In fact, hand hygiene is a major contributing factor to the current infection threats to hospital inpatients.49 Barker et al.50 showed that norovirus is consistently transferred via the fingers to melamine surfaces and from there to other typical hand-contact surfaces, such as taps, door handles and telephone receivers. Pessoa-Silva et al.51 demonstrated that hands become increasingly contaminated with commensal flora and potential pathogens during neonatal care and that gloves do not fully protect the workers' hands from contamination. Pittet et al.52 concluded that bacterial contamination increased linearly with time on ungloved hands during patient care. This demonstrates the importance of decontaminating hands before every patient contact. Fendler et al.53 concluded that the use of an alcohol gel hand sanitizer decreased infection rates during a 34 month period and can provide an additional tool for an effective infection control programme. The same conclusion was reached by Hilburn et al.54 The gloves of medical staff are also easily infected from direct contact with an infected patient or, indirectly, by touching contaminated surfaces, which serve as a carrier for pathogenic microorganisms.11 In a study focused on MRSA infection, 42% of personnel gloves that contacted the furniture/surfaces of a patient room but had no direct contact with infected patients were contaminated.37,44 More significantly, it was found that 65% of the nursing staff that had directly treated an infected individual contaminated their gowns/uniforms with the organism.55 The white coats, shirts and ties of doctors have also been found to contain potentially pathogenic flora.56",

Moreover, viable spores still attached to various materials can remain undetected by current sporicidal tests, resulting in overestimation of the sporicidal activity of sterilizing agents.65",

            "text": "Countless studies have been performed regarding the antimicrobial action and efficacy of different disinfectants. Rutala and Weber69 reviewed the use of inorganic hypochlorite (bleach) in healthcare facilities for disinfection of medical devices and environmental surfaces, and concluded that the many advantages of chlorine (e.g. fast microbiocidal activity, cost-effectiveness and good track record) are likely to support its continued use in healthcare settings. Griffiths et al.73 evaluated the efficacy of several disinfectants (sodium dichloroisocyanurate, chlorine dioxide, 70% industrial methylated spirits, 2% alkaline glutaraldehyde, 10% succinedialdehyde and formaldehyde mixture, 0.35% peracetic acid and a peroxygen compound at 1% and 3%) against different strains of mycobacteria and showed that disinfectants based on sodium dichloroisocyanurate were more effective. Moreover, they concluded that clinical strains were more resistant to biocides than laboratory type strains.73 Other studies have shown that chlorhexidine at 0.5% concentration is the best choice, among several antiseptics and surface disinfectants (including betadine, hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite, alcohol and ultraviolet radiation), to kill clinical yeast isolates, either in planktonic cultures or in biofilm.74 Oie et al.75 analysed the effects of four different chemical treatments (0.2% alkyldiaminoethyl glycine, 0.01% or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite and 80% ethyl alcohol) on the disinfection of porous and smooth surfaces contaminated by S. aureus in a university hospital. The results demonstrated that the disinfection of porous surfaces was more difficult and none of the disinfectants was effective, highlighting the need for more frequent disinfection and the use of high-level disinfectants on these surfaces.75 More recently, Speight et al.76 evaluated the effect of 32 disinfectants on spores of C. dif\ufb01cile by a suspension test and only eight products gave >3 log10 reduction in viability within 1 min (to have a more realistic simulation of probable real-life exposures) under dirty conditions (3% BSA). These results underscore the importance of carefully selecting the disinfectant to eliminate spores of this particular microorganism.76 Kim et al.77 analysed the effectiveness of 13 disinfectants used in hospitals, day-care centres and food service kitchens (ZEP FS Amine Z, ZEP DZ-7, Lemonex, ZEP Micronex, T.B.Q., ZEP FS Formula 386 L, Perosan Liquid Sanitizer, LpH se, Vesphene IIse, Coverage Spray HB Plus, Coverage Spray TB, ZEP Kitchen Surface Sanitizer and ZEP FS RTU-D2) against Enterobacter sakazakii in suspension, dried on stainless steel and in biofilm, and concluded that not all biocides used in hospitals can kill this microorganism. Also, the efficacy of disinfectants was higher for planktonic cells (reduction to undetectable levels).77 Bridier et al.78 studied the effects of three common disinfectants (peracetic acid, benzalkonium chloride and ortho-phthalaldehyde) on 77 bacterial strains and found that mycobacteria demonstrated a marked resistance to all the biocides. Benzalkonium chloride was inefficient even at very high concentrations. Also, resistance was dependent on the strain within the same species.78 Guti\u00e9rrez-Mart\u00edn et al.79 analysed the activity of 16 active compounds and 11 commercial disinfectants against Campylobacter jejuni by performing a suspension test in the presence and absence of serum. High levels of reduction (>6 log10) for some disinfectants [chloramine-T, povidone iodine (1% available iodine), cetylpiridinium chloride, ethanol, isopropanol, chlorhexidine digluconate, formaldehyde, phenol and 10 of the 11 commercial formulations, especially those based on quaternary ammonium compounds] were obtained, regardless of the presence or absence of organic material.79 Table 3 compiles some of the available information regarding hospital disinfectants.\n",

Initial inocula of M. tuberculosis (\u223c3 log10) and Geobacillus stearothermophilus (6 log10) were exposed to HPV at 10 locations during room experiments and both microorganisms were inactivated in all locations within 90 min of HPV exposure.86 Falagas et al.38 reviewed other studies of disinfection with HPV against MRSA, C. difficile and other pathogens in several sampled hospital locations (including surgical wards, ward side rooms, single isolation rooms, multiple-bed ward bays and bathrooms); complete or almost complete disinfection of the sampled hospital sites was achieved with airborne hydrogen peroxide.

Researchers have focused on the development of surfaces with antimicrobial coatings in order to inhibit biofilm formation by either killing the bacteria or preventing their adhesion. Bacterial growth control can then occur by three different modes of action: biocide leaching, which involves the release of a cytotoxic compound to kill attached microorganisms; adhesion prevention, which uses a super-hydrophobic covering in order to prevent microbial adhesion; and contact killing, which consists of disruption of cell membranes in contact with the surface.13 Many of these techniques consist of surface modification by introduction of antimicrobial substances such as antibiotics, metals (such as copper and silver) and antiseptics.93\u201398 These surfaces can be obtained by different methods, including adsorption, ligand\u2013receptor pairing and covalent binding.94 Surfaces that release antimicrobial products can work quite efficiently, although they eventually become exhausted and the diffusible antimicrobials pose the potential problem of inducing microbial resistance, since the surfaces are continually releasing active compounds to the environment for a long period of time.55,99 Alternatively, the design of surfaces that kill microbes on contact and do not release biocides may solve this problem. The covering of surfaces with transient metals, such as copper and silver as mentioned above, is a well-established strategy. Moreover, surfaces that catalytically produce biocides using externally applied chemical, electrical or optical energy are an interesting alternative.99",

In the presence of water and oxygen, highly reactive OH\u2212 radicals generated by TiO2 and mild UV-A are able to destroy bacteria, thus reducing bacterial contamination.100 Another example of a product that releases an organic antimicrobial is Microban\u00ae, which contains triclosan [5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)-phenol] as the antimicrobial agent, making the surface resistant to the growth of microorganisms.55 This antimicrobial technology can be found in hundreds of consumer, industrial and medical products around the world.",

            "text": "Gas plasma is another promising alternative to sterilization that can be applied in healthcare services, although it is mainly targeted to equipment rather than to surfaces. Plasma consists of a mixture of photons, electrons, ions, atoms and radicals (such as atomic oxygen, ozone, nitrogen oxides, hydroxyl and superoxide). As a result of air plasma discharges, the gas enters an ionized state (by energetic transfer) and exhibits antimicrobial properties.9,20,105,106 Two types of plasma can be defined according to the conditions under which the plasma is formed: thermal and non-thermal plasmas. Compared with non-thermal plasmas, thermal plasmas require higher pressure and are characterized by higher temperatures and a local thermodynamic equilibrium.105,106 These systems have many advantages over more conventional disinfection techniques as they enable the disinfection of the interior of some types of equipment and materials, such as needles, at low cost and with easy handling.107,108 Furthermore, gas plasma does not require chemical products and it is not toxic to the skin.20 Shimizu et al.108 performed treatments with plasma using a surface micro-discharge device, under different temperature and humidity conditions. The antimicrobial effect was tested on Escherichia coli and Enterococcus mundtii with a reduction of 5 log10 after 15 and 30 s of plasma treatment for E. mundtii and E. coli, respectively.108 Other researchers have developed a large-scale plasma dispenser and evaluated its effect on E. coli and Candida albicans in agar plates in the presence and absence of textiles.107 Their results demonstrated that the system was not affected by the presence of the textile, and in both cases a 15 s treatment caused a 5 log10 reduction and, after treatment for 5 s, the fungi were reduced by 4 log10. Joshi et al.10 studied the biocidal efficacy of non-thermal dielectric-barrier discharge plasma against E. coli, S. aureus and MRSA in biofilms and planktonic cells. The planktonic cells were completely eliminated after 120 s of treatment, whereas the MRSA growing in biofilms were killed by >60% within 15 s, suggesting that the effectiveness of a plasma system is highly dependent on exposure time and cell density.10 Recent investigations evaluated the effect of non-thermal gas plasma on biofilms of Staphylococcus epidermidis and MRSA on glass surfaces; a log10 reduction of 4 and 4.5 was observed after 1 h of exposure, respectively, and greater reductions could be attained with more prolonged exposure times.9 Burts et al.20 tested an atmospheric non-thermal plasma as a disinfectant for hospital pagers by analysis of MRSA reduction, and found complete disinfection within 30 s. Different cell densities and exposure times were also evaluated and a 4\u20135 log10 reduction was obtained within 10 min. More information regarding this disinfection strategy has been reviewed by Moisan et al.105,106 These novel disinfection techniques are important means of reducing the high numbers of nosocomial infections and are more efficient than conventional disinfection methods.",

Furthermore, the development of new antibiotics is a difficult task because of high research costs and regulatory issues. Conventional cleaning methods for the eradication of hospital environmental contamination seem to be inefficient. This manuscript reviews several new disinfection alternatives as attempts to overcome these problems. Most of the data currently available have been generated by the manufacturers and need to be validated by independent investigations. Moreover, studies concerning bacterial biology and physiology allied to genomics and computer analysis should be applied to identify and understand the pathogenesis associated with resistant bacteria and crucial targets for novel biocides. Thus, further evaluation and implementation of new measures and new disinfection methods are necessary, not forgetting their validation in terms of effectiveness, safety and disposal. Additionally, it is important always to evaluate the risk of emerging phenotypic resistance when developing new disinfection strategies.",
