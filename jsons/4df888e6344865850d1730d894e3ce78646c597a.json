HAP is common in patients with severe underlying disease, prolonged antibiotics, intravascular devices, and mechanical ventilation. The latter is also termed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). In a prospective study of 1014 mechanically ventilated patients, VAP developed in 177 patients. The mean time to onset was 9 days, with a median time to onset of 7 days after ICU admission. However, when the daily hazard rate of infection was calculated, it was estimated to be 3.3% at day 5, 2.3% at day 10, and 1.3% at day 15 (Cook et al. 1998 ). This documents a significant decline in pneumonia risk with time. Because the risk for pneumonia is so high early after intubation, pneumonias beginning within the first 5 days (earlyonset infection) account for 50% of all episodes of VAP, and the natural history and pathogens of this infection differ from those associated with VAP of late onset (Prod'hom et al. 1994) . Common isolates are gram-negative bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus. Typical radiologic patterns cannot be described. This is due to the different circumstances and risk factors, which contribute to the development of HAP. The other explanations are the different organisms responsible for the pneumonia. Within the first days the more common organisms are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Hemophilus influenzae (Craven and Steger 1995) . Later on, gram-negative rods predominate.",

The host defense system includes physical and chemical barriers to infection, the inflammatory response, and the immune response. Physical barriers, such as the skin and mucous membranes, prevent invasion by most organisms. Chemical barriers include lysozymes and hydrochloric acid. Lysozymes destroy bacteria by removing cell walls. Hydrochloric acid breaks down food and mucus that contains pathogens. The inflammatory response involves polymorphonuclear leukocytes, basophils, mast cells, platelets, and, to some extent, monocytes and macrophages. The immune response primarily involves the interaction of lymphocytes (T and B), macrophages, and macrophage-like cells and their products. These cells may be circulating or may be localized in the immune system's tissues and organs (Springhouse 2007) . Primary immune deficiency diseases are disorders in which part of the body's immune system is missing or does not function properly. In contrast to secondary immune deficiency disease in which the immune system is compromised by factors outside the immune system, such as viruses or chemotherapy, the primary immune deficiency diseases are caused by intrinsic or genetic defects in the immune system.",

The two patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis showed much lower values of T1, which probably reflects the relative absence of water within the airspaces and the presence of lipoprotein. In general, T1 and T2 values increase in proportion to the water content of fluids or tissue, but they are also influenced by the presence of lipids and by interaction between water and both large and small molecules with which they come in contact (Moore et al. 1986 ). High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) had become the gold standard in the evaluation of chronic infiltrative lung diseases, and it was shown that it accurately reflects the pathologic abnormalities. The aim of a study from M\u00fcller et al. (1992) was to compare MRI with HRCT in the assessment of these entities. All MR studies were performed on a 1.5-T MR imager. Cardiacgated proton density-weighted and relatively T2-weighted images were obtained at two or three RR intervals. The slice thickness was 10 mm, with a 1-or 2-mm interslice gap.

            "text": "Another topic in literature is the differentiation between benign and malignant nodular lesions of the lung. Growth factors and calcification pattern are only two of the noninvasive diagnostic criteria to separate benign from suspicious lesions and avoid unnecessary invasive tests. To overcome the limitation of morphological features, Li et al. (2000) included 62 patients to be evaluated for suspicious lung nodules with CT and dynamic Gd-DTPA-enhanced MRI. Axial T1-weighted images (TR 500 ms, TE 10 ms) with a slice thickness of 5 mm at 0, 15, 45, 75, 110, and 140 s, and 3, 5, 8, and 10 min were obtained. Additional T2-weighted images (TR 3000 ms, TE 80 ms) were acquired before contrast application. After correlation with pathological findings, they found that nodular fibrosis, inflammatory granulomas, cryptococcoma, and inflammatory pseudotumor had a more or less low rate of contrast uptake. On the other hand, focal organizing pneumonia and sclerosing hemangioma had a significant and early enhancement. Taking into account that malignant nodules are characterized by a fast increase in signal intensity during the first pass of the contrast agent (G\u00fcckel et al. 1996) , malignancy of some nodular lesions could be excluded by dynamic MRI (Li et al. 2000) . Rupprecht et al. (2002) performed a study without contrast agent and investigated a steadystate free precession sequence (true FISP) as a potential alternative to the conventional X-ray in pediatric patients with suspected pneumonia. A true FISP sequence was chosen because of its high spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in fluid-and thus T2-dominated infectious pulmonary disease. To overcome breathing artifacts in this particular patient group and to increase the S/N ratio, they obtained slice thicknesses of 30-55 mm at a 0.2-T low-field MR system. The true FISP sequence had the following parameters: TR 6 ms, TE 3 ms, FA 90\u00b0. The acquisition time for a triple slice scan was 4.8 s, and the door-to-door time was between 10 and 15 min. All pathological findings in the conventional chest X-ray could be identified in the corresponding MR investigation, and the MRI was superior in demonstrating pleural and pericardial effusions. Two small retrocardial pneumonic infiltrates were noted in the MRI only. The authors concluded that this technique could represent an alternative to the conventional chest X-ray (Rupprecht et al. 2002) . Such an alternative might be of special interest in children with Nijmegen-Breakage syndrome. This entity is an autosomal recessive chromosomal instability syndrome, characterized by microcephaly, growth retardation, skin abnormalities, immunodeficiency, radiation sensitivity, and a strong predisposition to lymphoid malignancy. Because of their sensitivity to ionizing radiation, X-ray and CT examination should be avoided (Alibek et al. 2007) .",

Images were acquired up to 8 days post infection. The virulent strain caused an intense inflammation within 2 days in the whole lungs, while an avirulent strain did not show significant changes. The increase in cell density accompanied with extravascular leakage results in an increase in high water content detectable by MRI. After treatment with antibiotics, the inflammation disappeared after a week. The lesions observed by MRI correlated with the damage seen by histological analysis. In summary, MRI allows observing the appearance and regression of inflammation (Tournebize et al. 2006) .",

For practical reasons, T2-weighted sequences can be highly recommended for the delineation of infiltrates in the lung.

Especially in this particular group of patients, pneumonia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. The imaging of infiltrates is very challenging, because the immunosuppression decreases the response of the lung to infectious agents. On the other hand, the patterns of pneumonia are highly variable and depend on multiple factors, like underlying diseases, time course, and treatment. By now, a considerable proportion of pulmonary fungal infections are not diagnosed antemortem in cancer patients. In addition, especially patients after bone marrow transplantation are often younger, and repetitive CT examinations carry an additional radiation burden. Leutner et al. (2000) tried to find out how MRI compares with CT regarding the depiction of typical features of pneumonia and the detectability of lesions. MRI studies were performed with a 1.5-T system, and the imaging protocol consisted of a transversal T2-weighted ultrashort turbo spin-echo sequence (TR 2000-4000 ms, TE 90 ms, slice thickness 6 mm, and six numbers of excitation). In comparison to helical CT (slice thickness 8 mm), they evaluated presence, number, and location of pulmonary infiltrates (nodular, reticular, cysts, cavitation, consolidation, and ground-glass infiltration). In summary, most of the CT and MR examinations (75%) were rated as showing identical results concerning not only the number but also the morphology of different lesions that were due to opportunistic pneumonia. In addition, MRI was able to differentiate between consolidation and ground-glass infiltration (Leutner et al. 2000) .",

Ill-defined nodules, ground-glass opacity areas, and consolidations, their location and distribution, and their lesion characteristics (e.g., margin contour, cavitation, calcification) were systematically analyzed. Twenty-two patients had pulmonary abnormalities on CT. In 21 (95%) patients, pneumonia was correctly diagnosed with MRI. One false-negative finding occurred in a patient with illdefined nodules smaller than 1 cm at CT. One falsepositive finding with MR was the result of blurring and respiratory artifacts. That results in a sensitivity of MRI in comparison to 1-mm CT slices of 95%, specificity of 88%, positive predictive value of 95%, and a negative predictive value of 88% (Eibel et al. 2006a ). In the detection of ground-glass opacity areas (Figs. 5 and 6), consolidations (Fig. 7) , and pleural effusion, MRI seems to be equal to thin-section CT. But the overall detection rate of nodules with MRI was only 72% (186/259). Detailed analyses found out that all nodules larger than 10 mm were reliably detected. The mean size of nodular lesions not found with MRI was 4 mm. This difference likely relates to the section thickness used with CT (1 mm) and MR imaging (6 mm). After this study, the authors came to the conclusion that pulmonary imaging for the detection and quantification of infiltrates is highly reliable with modern MR scanners (Eibel et al. 2006b ). Despite these encouraging results, it is important to keep in mind that CT has to be preferred in the detection of calcification, which can indicate some special disease entities and can be a sign of pulmonary scarring.",

The development of an \"air-crescent sign\" in a pulmonary nodule may also be interpreted as a sign of recovery when found in angioinvasive aspergillosis (Fig. 7) patients that already suffer from an underlying pulmonary disease or are immunocompromised. As invasive organisms, the latter can cause severe tissue destruction and can influence the clinical outcome dramatically.",

This crescent like air collection is associated with a higher risk of massive hemoptysis. Blum et al. (1994) observed another characteristic feature of necrotizing pneumonia. On T2-weighted images, higher signal intensity in the center combined with comparatively lower signal intensity in the rim outlined a characteristic feature that they called \"reverse target sign.\" While the halo phenomenon is strongly suggestive of invasive aspergillosis in its early course, the reverse target sign is detectable in later stages.",

(2015) published a feasibility study using a versatile multishot radial TSE sequence under free breathing with modified golden-ratio-based reordering designed to prevent coherent streaking. They investigated healthy volunteers and patients with lung cancer and pneumonia, while the data were acquired during free respiration in a 90-s scan time. In conclusion, the authors found that this radial TSE sequence in combination with a modified golden-ratio-based reordering offers improved robustness towards motion. This allows for longer scan times over several respiratory cycles, thereby improving the SNR and facilitating high-quality morphological lung MRI which may help to improve the diagnosis of subtle disease. Restrictively, the performance with regard to making the diagnosis of pneumonia or lung cancer earlier, or with more confidence, was not evaluated in this study. Here further work is necessary.",

The edema is clearly detectable in the right upper lobe pneumonia (arrow), but the degree of artifacts and noise is higher in comparison to the HASTE sequence. (e) Coronal true FISP. The vessels are clearly detectable (short arrows). So this sequence can be an alternative to the contrast-enhanced FLASH to delineated adjacent vasculature. The pneumonia itself is not better appreciable in comparison to the HASTE and contrast-enhanced FLASH",

            "text": "from malignant lesions is limited. This is especially true for the differentiation of pneumonialike mucinous adenocarcinoma and infectious pneumonia. This type of carcinoma has a rising incidence and carries a poor prognosis. Because of the similarities to pneumonia at radiography and CT, the correct diagnosis is often performed with delay. Gaeta et al. found out that watersensitive sequences (axial HASTE and coronal RARE) can add substantial information. In this study, the correct diagnoses of mucinous adenocarcinomas and pneumonia on CT images were possible in 74% and 73% for reader 1 and 65% and 80% reader 2, whereas both readers could make the correct diagnosis in 100% of cases with the aid of these two MR sequences. The most important finding was the so-called white lung sign, which is positive due to the high intratumoral content of mucin, but is negative in pneumonia (Gaeta et al. 2011 ).An important topic is the use of MRI in young patients. It is known from a study of Pearce et al. (2012) that MDCT, which can deliver a cumulative radiation dose of approximately 50 mGy, may triple the risk of development of leukemia and that doses of approximately 60 mGy may triple the risk of brain cancer in children. So a major advantage of MRI is the lack of ionizing radiation. But therefore it is necessary to make confident diagnoses on MR images. Gorkem et al. could demonstrate that with contrast-enhanced MDCT findings as the reference standard, unenhanced MRI with fastimaging-sequences accurately depicted 94% lung abnormalities (consolidation, cystic hydatid disease, bronchiectasis, lung masses and nodules), 100% mediastinal masses, 100% pleural effusions, and 100% chest wall masses. The two undiagnosed findings with MRI were mild bronchiectasis and small pulmonary nodule (3 mm). Taking these results into account, the authors concluded that unenhanced MRI can be the first-line cross-sectional imaging in lieu of contrast-enhanced MDCT. This seems particularly true for pediatric patients who need multiple imaging studies for monitoring diseases (Gorkem et al. 2013 ).In addition, Wielp\u00fctz et al. focused on a particular disease in the pediatric and adolescent group, the cystic fibrosis (CF). Demirkazik et al. (2001) found out that MDCT is more sensitive than chest radiograph in delineating the CF-associated pulmonary alterations. In recent development, MRI is increasingly replacing MDCT as the technique for diagnosing complications or monitoring the disease (Wielp\u00fctz et al. 2013) . MRI shows the typical changes of bronchiectasis, wall thickening, mucus plugging, and infiltrates (\"plus pathologies\" on MRI) sensitively and with comparable clinical relevance compared to MDCT (Puderbach et al. 2007 ). Furthermore, MR perfusion imaging making use of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (Euler-Liljestrand reflex) shows potentially reversible perfusion and ventilation impairment. At present, MRI is being used for the first time in a German multicenter study in the framework of the neonatal cystic fibrosis screening program, providing a secondary surrogate endpoint for preventive treatment strategies (Wielp\u00fctz et al. 2014) .Despite further developments in MR imaging, CT outnumbers MRI in pulmonary imaging by far. Explanations are manifold like higher resolution, shorter scan times, availability, patient access during examination, and of course economic factors. Reducing artifacts, receiving more signal, and observing a higher degree of anatomical information will result in longer examination times which on the other hand is limited by the time the patient is able to stop breathing. Therefore, free breathing would be necessary which may lead to respiratory and blurring artifacts. ",
