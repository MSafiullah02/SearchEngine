            "text": "Laboratory-confirmed H7N9 infections in humans have been reported in eight contiguous provinces in eastern China (Anhui, Fujian, Henan, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shandong and Zhejiang), two municipalities (Beijing and Shanghai) and Taiwan to date4. Although historically this subtype resulted in mild illness among humans3, the majority of novel A(H7N9) cases have resulted in severe respiratory illness in adults, representing the largest occurrence of H7 virus infections in humans2. Unlike highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses, which exhibit lethality in poultry and cause severe human disease, low pathogenic (LPAI) H7N9 viruses seem to be asymptomatic or cause mild disease in poultry and wild bird populations, possibly due to the presence of a single amino acid in the haemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site of this virus2,5. Similar to H5N1 viruses, human cases with H7N9 virus seem to result from direct contact with infected poultry, yet >20% of confirmed H7N9 cases have reported no exposure to live animals6. Although sustained human-to-human transmission has not been observed with this virus to date, reports of family clusters of A(H7N9) infection suggest the potential for virus spread between close contacts6. Understanding the properties of A(H7N9) viruses which contribute to human disease and their capacity for human-to-human transmission is a critical requirement for guidance of public health responses. The ferret (Mustela putorius furo) is recognized as the best small mammalian model for the concurrent study of influenza virus pathogenicity and transmissibility, and was used here to assess the virulence of A(H7N9) viruses.",

A/Shanghai/1/13 (Shanghai/1) virus was isolated from an adult male patient with no known poultry exposure who died from refractory hypoxemia 13 days after illness onset2. These A(H7N9) viruses from China possess several molecular markers previously associated with human adaptation, including the presence of E627K in the PB2 protein and Q226L in the 210-loop in the HA gene2. Glycan microarray analysis of these phylogenetically distinct viruses revealed that Shanghai/1 (bearing Q226 in the HA (H3 numbering)) largely binds to avian \u03b12,3 receptor analogues (glycans 4 to 40) (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1), whereas Anhui/1 virus (bearing L226), revealed a mixed \u03b12,3/\u03b12,6 receptor preference (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1); the single Q226L amino substitution has long been recognized to modulate receptor-binding specificity7. In particular, Anhui/1 virus bound to human biantennary structures (glycans 43 to 47), as well as the longer, linear \u03b12,6 sialylated tri-N-acetyl lactosamine (glycans 58\u201360), some of which have been detected in N glycans of cultured human bronchial epithelial cells8. These findings are in accord with recent studies showing that Anhui/1 virus binds to human tracheal tissue sections, albeit at a lower intensity than other human-adapted viruses9,10.",

Approximately 24 h post-inoculation (p.i.), inoculated\u2013contact pairs were established by placing a naive ferret in the same cage as an inoculated ferret (direct contact transmission), or in an adjacent cage with perforated side-walls (respiratory droplet transmission)12. Nasal washes were collected on alternate days from all animals and titred for the presence of infectious virus12. The A(H7N9) viruses were compared to a seasonal H3N2 virus, A/Texas/50/2012 (Texas/50), representative of H3N2 viruses circulating in the 2012\u20132013 northern hemisphere season13.",

Mean titres in nasal washes were sustained at >105 p.f.u. in Anhui/1 and Shanghai/1 virus-infected ferrets through day 3 p.i. (Supplementary Fig. 4). Efficient direct contact transmission occurred by day 1 post-contact, with viral titres in nasal wash samples reaching comparable titres to inoculated ferrets by day 3 post-contact. Respiratory droplet transmission of Anhui/1 virus was observed in 2/6 ferrets, with detection of virus in contact ferret nasal washes delayed 2\u20134 days compared to seasonal H3N2 virus; Shanghai/1 virus was detected in 1/3 ferrets in this model (Supplementary Fig. 4). These results are in accord with a recently published study demonstrating only limited transmissibility of A/Shanghai/2/13 virus by the airborne route15. Sequence analysis of virus gene segments obtained from nasal wash samples of A(H7N9) respiratory droplet contact animals (total n = 3) revealed no substantial amino acid changes. No sequence changes were observed from nasal washes obtained from the Shanghai/1 respiratory droplet contact ferret compared to Shanghai/1 sequences submitted to GISAID. Sequencing of nasal wash samples obtained on days 5\u20137 p.i. from Anhui/1 respiratory droplet contact ferrets revealed only one amino acid substitution in the HA protein at R140M (H3 numbering), not found among Anhui/1 inoculated ferrets. This position is located in the HA 140 loop region of HA1 and is not known to be associated with changes in H7 HA receptor binding or influenza virus transmission. Although A(H7N9) viruses are not readily transmissible by respiratory droplets, the efficient virus transmission observed in the direct-contact model has not been observed with H5N1 viruses12 and may indicate the capacity of an A(H7N9)-like virus to acquire properties that would confer efficient airborne transmission.",

To assess the relative contribution of these avian precursors to the pathogenicity of the 2013 H7N9 viruses, we inoculated BALB/c mice intranasally with A/shoveler/Egypt/00215-NAMRU3/07 (shv/Egypt/07)16, an H7N9 virus with high surface glycoprotein amino acid sequence identity to Anhui/1, A/chicken/Vietnam/NCVD-1156/2011 (ck/VN/11), an H9N2 virus possessing internal genes with high genetic similarity to Anhui/1 virus, and the 2013 A(H7N9) viruses to determine virus replication, morbidity (as measured by weight loss), the 50% mouse infectious dose (MID50), and the 50% mouse lethal dose (LD50). MID50 titres were markedly low for all viruses, demonstrating high infectivity of the avian viruses in this model; typically human viruses do not replicate efficiently in mice without prior host adaptation17 (Table 2). Mice inoculated with Anhui/1 or Shanghai/1 virus showed severe morbidity (>20% weight loss) and a LD50 of 103.3\u2013103.4, a value comparable to the select group of HPAI H5N1 and H7N7 viruses which have a high-pathogenicity phenotype in this model18,19. In contrast, the avian precursor viruses shv/Egypt/07 and ck/VN/11 caused moderate morbidity in mice, but did not display a lethal phenotype (Table 2). Collectively, lung titres in Anhui/1 and Shanghai/1 virus-inoculated mice were significantly higher than LPAI precursor viruses examined day 3 p.i. (P < 0.05); by day 6 p.i., all H7N9 viruses were detected at comparable titre, >100-fold higher than the H9N2 virus at this time point (P < 0.05). All viruses examined replicated to low titres in the nose day 3 and 6 p.i. (Supplementary Fig. 5), and systemic spread of virus to the brain was not detected.",

Lethargy was measured as described previously14. Any ferret that lost >25% of its pre-inoculation body weight or showed neurological dysfunction was euthanized and submitted to post-mortem examination. Nasal washes, conjunctival washes and rectal swabs were collected on alternate days post-inoculation (p.i.) or post-contact, immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at \u221270 \u00b0C until titration as previously described25. Tissue specimens collected for virus titration were immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at \u221270 \u00b0C until titration as previously described18. Blood was collected from inoculated ferrets on indicated days p.i. in EDTA Vacutainer tubes (BD) and complete blood counts were quantified using a Hemavet HV950FS instrument per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Drew Scientific).",
