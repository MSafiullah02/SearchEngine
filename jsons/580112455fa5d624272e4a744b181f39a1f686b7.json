These include random amplification polymorphism of DNA-polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), sequence-characterised amplified region (SCAR) and real-time PCR technology. 3,13 -17 Nevertheless, these methods rely on specialised equipment and well-trained technicians, neither of which is commonly available in the field. In addition, they are expensive and time consuming, which precludes their use in large-scale surveys. More importantly, these methods might not be capable of providing real-time information for pest control strategies. In the present paper, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was applied for the rapid identification of B. tabaci biotypes. The LAMP assay was developed for rapid, efficient and specific amplification of DNA, and it is performed under isothermal conditions that require a water bath or a heat block to catalyse the reaction. This method requires no specialised equipment or specially trained technicians and is more cost effective than real-time PCR. Therefore, LAMP is suitable for large-scale field surveys and can provide useful information for pest control strategies. LAMP is a popular and useful method for rapid pathogen/pest detection and identification. For instance, it was applied to detect the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, a serious human disease pathogen associated with pneumonia. 18 In previous studies, a whitefly-transmitted geminivirus was diagnosed with LAMP in infected plants. 19, 20 The LAMP assay has also been applied to identify malaria mosquito vectors and the Mediterranean fruit fly, an important insect pest. 21, 22 Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene was selected to design LAMP primers specific for B. tabaci B and Q biotypes. The COI gene is commonly used to study and identify different biotypes of the B. tabaci species complex. 2, 13, 23 COI sequences of different biotypes were downloaded from GenBank, and two sets of primers were designed for the LAMP assay. It was shown that the present assay could specifically and accurately identify the B and Q biotypes. Applying LAMP assays to monitor the population dynamics of whitefly populations revealed that, while temperature may be important for population dynamics of whiteflies in the field, population dynamics in greenhouse conditions might be influenced by the types of insecticide. Therefore, LAMP assays would be useful in identifying B and Q biotypes to help with pest management.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 292, "end": 300, "text": "3,13 -17", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1497, "end": 1499, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1600, "end": 1603, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1604, "end": 1606, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1740, "end": 1743, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1744, "end": 1746, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1983, "end": 1985, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1986, "end": 1989, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1990, "end": 1992, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Whiteflies were collected from Taiwan or obtained from other researchers ( Table 1) .

Firstly, unlike PCR-based methods, which require special equipment and reagents, the present method requires only a thermostat (such as a water or dry bath) with limited kinds of chemical. Secondly, when combined with quick DNA extraction methods, which can be done in 10 min, the total reaction takes only 1 h. Thirdly, the LAMP assay is cost effective, as one reaction costs less than $US 1 (DNA extraction, $US 0.25; primers, $US 0.07; Bst polymerase, $US 0.5; dNTP, $US 0.04; SYBR, $US 0.04). Fourthly, the result is easily visualised by a colour change, and no sophisticated analytical tool is necessary for interpretation. Finally, the procedures described here can be performed by nonspecialists who have limited knowledge of whiteflies or molecular biology. All of the above make it possible to conduct large-scale surveys in the field. In addition, the current design provides realtime monitoring for biotypes B and Q. Because these two biotypes are known to have different levels of insecticide resistance, the information could be useful in whitefly control.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The present methods were applied to monitor the population dynamics of B. tabaci biotypes in Taiwan. The B biotype was first introduced into Taiwan in the early 1990s, 25 but its proportions among whitefly populations over time remain unclear. In the present data, the proportion of biotype B gradually increased over the course of the season in whitefly populations collected from the field in Miaoli, Taoyuan and Yilan counties. The increasing trend of B biotypes in these locations is interesting, because it seems to be consistent with the invasive theory of asymmetric mating interactions, 26 in which the invasive whitefly of B. tabaci biotype B is widely displacing indigenous biotypes in the field. However, in Nantou County, the opposite trend of a decreasing B biotype population was observed, suggesting the existence of unknown factors restricting population growth in that area. Because there was only limited correlation of B biotype abundance between samples collected from greenhouses and fields, population dynamics of biotype B in the field cannot be explained by the influence of whiteflies from greenhouses. According to the life-table study, environmental temperature strongly influences the development and reproduction of biotype B. The average adult longevity at 15, 20 and 28 \u2022 C was 5.5, 15.8 and 15.4 days respectively, and the fecundity levels at the above temperatures were 2, 54 and 109 eggs respectively. It seems that 20 \u2022 C is a critical temperature for the development and reproduction of biotype B. The average elevation of Nantou County is higher than those of the other three counties, and the average annual temperature in Nantou is 18.9 \u2022 C (the average monthly temperatures range from 15.4 to 22.5 \u2022 C), which is lower than the 22.7 \u2022 C in Yilan (19.8-26.4 \u2022 C), the 21.7 \u2022 C in Taoyuan (19.0-24.9 \u2022 C) and the 20.2 \u2022 C in Miaoli (17.5-24.2 \u2022 C).
