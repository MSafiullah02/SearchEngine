The success of vaccination programs depends on the ability of the birds to mount a vigorous immune response after vaccination. In addition to the innate ability of a particular bird to mount an immune response to a vaccine or an infection, there are numerous external factors influencing the level of protective immunity. The purpose of this chapter is to review the mechanisms and impact of immunosuppression, which can have multiple causes, and the ability of pathogens to counteract immune responses by immunoevasion.",

For this chapter, we define immunoevasion as \u201cpathogen-initiated responses counteracting the immune responses to the specific pathogen.\u201d The major difference is that immunosuppression is the consequence of the overall replicative strategy of the causative agent, resulting in increased susceptibility to other pathogens but not necessarily to the causative agent, while immunoevasion is achieved by specific pathogen-encoded determinants, primarily favoring replication of the causative agent. In some instances, infections can result in immunosuppression and immunoevasion\u2014for example, infection with Marek\u2019s disease virus (MDV).",

Environmental stressors include the later period of incubation, hatching and chick handling. Other stressors include suboptimal housing conditions and mycotoxins.

Other pathogens\u2014for example, chicken infectious anemia virus (CIAV)\u2014may cause clinical disease in young chicks, but the major damage is caused by subclinical infection resulting in immunosuppression. Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) also causes clinical disease in young chicks, but results in damage to immune tissue, particularly the bursa of Fabricius and bursa-derived lymphocytes, compromising the host\u2019s ability to mount effective responses upon subsequent infection by other pathogens. Caution is needed, however, in the interpretation of the immunosuppressive effects caused by reovirus, MDV, REV, and IBDV, especially with older studies, because it is not always clear whether these viruses were free of CIAV. For example, Jakowski et al. [4] reported hematopoietic destruction in chickens with Marek\u2019s disease, but it was later learned that tumor material harvested from these birds was positive for CIAV (Wellenstein, personal communication, cited in reference [5]). In addition to viral infections, coccidial infections have been linked to immunosuppression.",

A classic example is the study by Gross [6] in which MDV-exposed chickens were kept in a socially stressful environment by moving one chicken from one cage into another cage every day. These chickens developed a higher incidence of tumors than MDV-infected chickens kept in a low-stress environment. The effects of social stress on MD were especially enhanced in birds selected for high plasma corticosterone concentrations. Inoculation with chemicals blocking 11-\u03b2 hydroxylase, which mediates the conversion of deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone in the adrenal glands, reduced the impact of social stress on Marek\u2019s disease and other diseases 6., 7.. Inoculation of chickens with corticosterone using pharmacological doses resulted in a rapid lymphoid depletion in thymus, bursa, and spleen [8]. These authors suggested that bacterial infections (e.g., Escherichia coli) may cause stress-type lesions in the bursa similar to corticosterone-induced lymphoid depletion. Recently, it has been shown that high levels of corticosterone in hens reduce egg production and decrease testosterone and progesterone in the yolk, influencing the quality of the chicks [9]. In addition, embryonic exposure to increased levels of corticosterone can alter juvenile stress responses [10].",

The importance of mycotoxins as immunosuppressive toxins and their effects on immune functions have been reviewed by Bondy and Pestka [11] and Hoerr [3]. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is the best known fungal toxin for poultry, although chickens are rather resistant to the toxic effects compared to ducks and turkeys [12]. After ingestion, AFB1 is bioactivated in the liver by cytochrome P450 into the highly toxic component aflatoxin-8,9-epoxide, which can bind to DNA, or after being hydrolyzed, bind to proteins, causing cytotoxicity [13]. The consequences are cell death in the primary lymphoid organs, damage to the intestinal integrity and, especially in broilers, decreased performance.",

Chicks hatched from hens fed on diets containing aflatoxins also showed impaired immune functions when tested at 2\u20133 weeks of age, but it is not known how long after hatching the effects last [14]. Fumonisins, trichothecenes (e.g., T2) and ochratoxins (e.g., OTA) have also been implicated as immunotoxicants in chickens, turkeys and ducks. Low levels (15 ppm) of fumonisin B1 (FB1) given to broilers in the feed for 3 weeks reduced macrophage activity, reduced secondary antibody responses to Newcastle disease vaccines, and reduced gene expression of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-2, interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3. This level of FB1 does not cause a decrease in growth performance and is considered an acceptable level in chicken feed [15]. Two toxins belonging to the trichothecenes group, T-2 and deoxynivalenol (DON), have been linked to immunomodulation in chickens 16., 17.. Low doses of T-2 and DON have been linked to increased IgA levels and titers against Newcastle disease virus (NDV), while high doses cause immunosuppression. Broilers fed a diet containing DON and challenged with very virulent IBDV developed more severe effects than broilers fed a diet lacking DON [18].",

C. baileyi replicates in the epithelial cells of the bursa of Fabricius and the respiratory tract of chickens and is probably more prevalent than diagnostic cases indicate [29]. Oral inoculation of young chickens with high doses of C. baileyi caused histopathological lesions in the epithelium and lamina propia of the bursa [30] and decreased antibody responses to T cell-dependent and -independent antigens 31., 32.. Titers to infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), NDV and avian influenza (AI) vaccine were also decreased after inoculation of chicks with C. baileyi\n33., 34., 35.. However, Abbassi et al. 36., 37. found that infection with C. baileyi did not increase Marek\u2019s disease or reduce the efficacy of the MDV vaccine strain CVI988. Interestingly, MDV infection before or after challenge with C. baileyi aggravated the latter. Likewise, MDV vaccination followed 4 days later with C. baileyi challenge-caused respiratory lesions within 6 days (see also Section 16.2.5 MDV).",

[46] showed that deletion of VP5 did not prevent virus replication in vivo but did prevent the development of bursal lesions, suggesting a role for VP5 in the pathogenesis. Interestingly, in vitro studies suggest that very early after infection VP5 is anti-apoptotic [47], probably through binding to the p85\u03b1 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) [48]. Activated PI3K phosphorylates Akt which results in survival of infected cells early during infection. During the later stages of infection, VP5 accumulates in the plasma membrane [49] and causes apoptosis [50]. The induction of apoptosis was recently linked to activation of the Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) [51], although it was not resolved if VP5 or VP2 was responsible for the activation, which was also linked to apoptosis in infected B cells [52]. In addition to the apoptosis of IBDV-infected B cells, non-infected B cells can also undergo apoptosis [53], perhaps caused by the rapid increase of IFN-\u03b3 shortly after infection [54]. In summary, the molecular basis for IBDV-induced apoptosis of B cells is the result of a complex set of interactions between the different viral proteins and infected B cells.",

B cells in the large follicles were still capable of undergoing gene conversion and may have been derived from small numbers of surviving bursal stem cells. In contrast, the B cells in the small follicles were considered to be derived from more mature B cells that had already undergone gene conversion. These data suggest that the ability to recover from IBDV-induced suppression of antibody production and diversity is based on the proportion of small versus large follicles developing after infection. Recently, Bir\u00f3 et al.

The absolute number of macrophages in the bursa was decreased significantly at 3 and 5 days PI. Similarly, the number of macrophages was also decreased in spleens after IBDV infection [65]. The actual impact on the immune response of these observations is not clear. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1\u03b2, and CXCLi2, are increased at the transcriptional level in the bursa and spleen, while the anti-inflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b24 is decreased 63., 65., 66., 67.. These different groups of authors reported somewhat conflicting results for the production of type I IFN and IFN-\u03b3 transcription, but the differences could be the result of using different virus strains and/or infecting different age groups.

Recent studies by several groups have provided a better insight in the immunopathogenesis of IBDV in young birds; however, important questions remain. For example: How can we explain the recovery from infection in the face of suppression of primary antibody responses if neutralizing antibodies are the key to recovery? Do we have to postulate that cell-mediated immunity is far more important than previously believed, as suggested by the findings by Raul et al. [71]? Another unresolved question is why mostly young birds develop subclinical disease, while infection of older, antibody-negative birds results in clear-cut pathology including hemorrhages. There may be similarities between the situation in birds with IBDV and that in mice with influenza virus, where the immune response is responsible for most tissue damage, in which case the damage can be reduced by treatment with TGF-\u03b2 [41].",

Dividing cells that are susceptible to infection are hemocytoblasts in the bone marrow, T cell precursors in the thymus, or dividing T cells in response to antigenic stimulation. Infection of hemocytoblasts results in a decrease in erythrocytes, thrombocytes and granulocytes.

[78] reported that infection in 4-week-old chickens resulted in a moderate loss of CD4+ and CD8+ cells in the spleen and thymus. Infection in 1-day-old chicks causes a more severe depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ cells (e.g., [79]). The effect of virus replication in these cells is especially important when replication of CIAV occurs at the same time that cytotoxic T cells (CTL) are generated in response to vaccination or infection with a second pathogen. Markowksi-Grimsrud and Schat [80] reported the absence of REV-specific CTL 7 days after birds were co-infected with REV and CIAV, at which time CIAV was actively replicating, based on real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Because there was no effect of CIAV infection on transcription of IL-2 or IFN-\u03b3 at 7 days PI, it was suggested that the lack of pathogen-specific CTL was caused by CIAV-induced apoptosis of CD8+ cells during the generation of CTL. In contrast to the effect on CTL, natural killer (NK) cells were not affected by CIAV infection [81]. Based on their studies of CIAV infection in MSB-1 cells, Peters et al. [82] suggested that VP2 may also play a role in immunosuppression through down-regulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens. The importance of this observation for immunosuppression is difficult to evaluate because the assumption is that CIAV-infected cells will become apoptotic.",

Increased cytolytic infection, and thus increased damage to the lymphoid organs associated with some of the vv+ pathotypes, may be caused by a more effective transfer of MDV from B to T cells due to increased levels of vIL-8 production combined with the inability to establish latency after 7 days PI.",

What needs to be resolved is whether MDV-infected thymocytes become apoptotic or whether MDV-induced cytokine deregulation affecting thymocyte maturation causes apoptosis of non-infected cells and a collapse of the thymus architecture [111]. The latter is certainly possible, based on recent evidence that cytokines can be deregulated, especially after infection with vv+ strains. MDV infection can also cause apoptosis in CD4+ peripheral T cells, but CD8+ T cells are apparently not affected [129]. The reasons for the latter are not clear because CD8+ T cells can be infected with and transformed by MDV 130., 131.. Thus far, it has not been resolved which MDV gene products are responsible for immunsuppression. It is likely that the SORF2 gene plays a role, based on two studies using opposing experimental strategies. Deletion mutants lacking several ORFS, including SORF2, caused decreased cytolytic infection without preventing tumor formation [132]. Up-regulation of SORF2 expression through the insertion of the REV long terminal repeat (LTR) resulted in enhanced cytolytic infection in the absence of tumor development [133].",

Chicks hatched from congenitally infected eggs are tolerant and unable to produce VN antibodies to the virus; they are viraemic, antibody-negative (V+A\u2212) and likely to develop tumors or, in the case of REV, tumors and/or runting and stunting. Horizontal transmission during, or shortly after, hatching can also result in tolerance 140., 141.. This risk is enhanced in chicks when subgroup E or glycoprotein (gp) 85 of subgroup E is expressed during embryonal development [142] or after IBDV infection at 1 day or 6 weeks of age. IBDV infection decreased the frequency of VN antibody-positive chickens and increased virus shedding and viraemia levels significantly, although these effects were dependent on the genetic background of the birds. In contrast, infection with REV at 1 day of age, or MDV at 2 weeks of age, had no significant impact on ALV shedding, viraemia, and antibody development [143]. However, exposure to IBDV at 2 weeks of age did not influence the incidence of ALV-J [144]. The induction of tolerance after congenital infection is virus-specific and is not a general inability to produce antibodies against pathogens other than ALV or REV. For example, chickens congenitally infected with a specific strain of ALV-A were able to produce antibodies to other subgroup A strains [145] and influenza virus, but were partly tolerant to ALV-B [146].",

In contrast to ALV-A, subgroup B viruses have been linked to suppression of CMI responses. In ovo infection with MAV-2(O) resulted in severe damage to lymphoid organs, suppressed antibody responses, and mitogenic responsiveness [149]. In addition, MAV-2(O) causes a temporary dysfunction of macrophages, suppressing the responses of spleen cells to mitogens 148., 150.. The depressed responses were present as early as 3 days PI and lasted until 21 days PI. Macrophage dysfunction reduced the ability to clear bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes\n[151]. A second subgroup B virus, avian erythroblastosis (an acute transforming, defective virus), and its associated helper virus also suppressed T cell responses to mitogens, but in this case the suppression was directly related to T cells and not macrophages [152].",

It is therefore surprising that FWPV vaccines are still frequently contaminated with REV 176., 177., suggesting a lack of quality control. The presence of REV in FWPV or FWPV vaccines can result in immunosuppression causing outbreaks of fowlpox, as suggested by Motha and Egerton [178]. Wang et al. [179] compared FWPV vaccine strains with and without REV inserts and wild-type FWPV containing REV. REV-positive FWPV strains, in contrast to those lacking REV, caused decreased antibody titers to BSA and SRBC and decreased responses to PHA-P skin tests and in vitro lymphocyte stimulation.",

Treatment of chickens with corticosterones or related glucocorticoids results in lymphopenia and atrophy of the lymphoid organs.

At the time that cells become apoptotic, VP3 forms discrete nuclear structures. The carboxy terminus is positively charged and, based on work with deletion mutants, it is suggested that the positive charge is important for the interaction with the nuclear DNA.

The factors involved in immunoevasion were most easily identified in the large DNA viruses (poxviruses and herpesviruses). With the exception of the molluscipoxviruses, which have no direct relatives in birds but have some similarities with the avian poxviruses, poxviruses cause acute infections; therefore, their immunoevasion mechanisms need only counter (or are only capable of countering) the innate immune responses and possibly delay the acquired responses.",

Morgan et al. [189], using micro-array analysis, found that MDV up-regulated MHC class I, but this is likely to have been IFN-driven. A mechanism that may favor survival of MDV in its latent state is promotion of the survival of MDV-transformed tumor cells. Whether this is achieved directly by enhanced expression of chicken CD30, previously identified as the AV37 antigen [190], or by the down-regulation of CD28 seen in cells overexpressing CD30 [191] is not clear, nor is the actual viral mechanism of achieving these perturbations in cell surface marker expression.",

More informatively referred by its synonym, eotaxin, IL-8 is a chemokine capable of attracting eosinophils. Deletion of vIL-8 121., 122. or exon 1 of vIL-8 [123] from the RB-1B strain of MDV resulted in a lower frequency of birds with tumors and smaller, less invasive tumors. This suggests that vIL-8 affects virus replication rather than tumorigenesis.

Recent phylogenetic studies, based on only a couple of conserved genes, reveal that the avipoxviruses show considerable diversity, equivalent to that observed between the Capripoxvirus, Suipoxvirus, Yatapoxvirus and Leporipoxvirus genera of the mammalian poxviruses. They appear to form three major clusters (or clades) of related viruses, one broadly related to FWPV and one to canarypox virus (CNPV), and the other comprising the psittacine poxviruses [193]. Various phylogenenetic studies have indicated that the mammalian poxvirus most closely related to the avipoxviruses is the human Molluscum cotagiosum virus, with which avipoxviruses share many common features of molecular biology; these include key aspects of gene complement and organization, as well as aspects of pathogenesis.",

Avipoxviruses cause diseases ranging in severity and mortality from relatively mild cutaneous infections (e.g., fowlpox in chickens) through the more severe diphtheritic infections (also seen in some cases of fowlpox) to disseminated systemic or pneumonia-like infections with high mortality (e.g., CNPV infections). The nature of the infection is probably related to host\u2013virus adaptation, in which immunoevasion mechanisms and especially immunomodulators play an important role.

This was in contrast to the mammalian poxviruses, which encode double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding proteins (e.g., E3 of vaccinia virus); mimics of eIF2\u03b1, the substrate for activated dsRNA-dependent protein kinase, PKR (e.g., vaccinia virus K3); and secreted, soluble binding proteins for IFN-I and IFN-\u03b3.

            "text": "The avipoxvirus genomes encode many as yet unassigned proteins, which might function in immunoevasion. For instance, one feature that distinguishes avipoxviruses from mammalian poxviruses is that the former encode several families of related proteins. Most notable is the family containing multiple ankyrin repeats. These are found in many types of host proteins, and their presence normally denotes a protein\u2013protein interaction. Up to 31 of the proteins in this family are encoded by FWPV, with 51 (15% of the total gene complement) encoded by the related Canarypox virus [202]. We have no idea of their targets, but presume they are likely to be host proteins and that at least some probably play a role in immunoevasion. Most of these proteins have C-terminal F-box motifs, which in other poxviruses have been shown to interact with the ubiquitin ligase complex via Skp1a and Cullin-1 [203]. By screening chimeric vaccinia MVA-carrying inserts of FWPV genomic DNA for enhanced resistance to chicken type I interferon, Buttigieg et al. [200] recently identified fpv014, an ankyrin repeat protein, as contributing to IFN resistance. They also demonstrated that fpv014 interacted with Cullin-1, but were unable to establish the identitiy of any cellular proteins bound by the ankyrin repeat domain and presumably destined for ubiquitination and likely degradation by the proteasome. Similarly, Laidlaw et al. [201] recently screened a library of FWPV mutants, each carrying a single non-essential gene knockout, for reduced ability to restrict polyI:C-mediated induction of expression of the chicken type I interferon \u03b2 promoter. They identified another ankyrin repeat protein, fpv012, as contributing to restricting interferon \u03b2 expression induced by dsRNA, but were also unable to identify the cellular ligand for the ankyrin repeat domain of fpv012.",

The study concluded that there was considerable heterogeneity within and between virus populations in their ability to induce and resist avian IFN-I. This heterogeneity was ascribed to their presence in the population of subpopulations that had packaged multiple genome segments. It was presumed that those particles that had packaged multiple segments encoding IFN resistance protein(s) displayed higher resistance, although this characteristic was not necessarily inherited. Such heterogeneity illustrates one of the potential complications of using live-recombinant influenza viruses to dissect out the role of particular molecular determinants of IFN resistance.",

The amino terminus (73 residues) of NS1, which dimerizes [218], is capable of binding dsRNA [219]\u2014albeit at relatively low affinity [217]\u2014thereby preventing activation of the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase, PKR [220]. NS1 also binds poly-adenylated RNA, inhibiting nuclear export of mRNAs [221], and a stem bulge in U6 snRNA, inhibiting pre-mRNA splicing in vitro and in vivo\n[221]. Both of these activities can down-regulate expression of cellular genes. They can also prevent IFN production by binding to IRF-3, blocking its kinase-mediated activation [213], and by blocking NF-\u03baB activation [222]. Although expression of NS1 alone was reported to induce apoptosis in MDCK and HeLa cells [223], in the context of a viral infection of mammalian or avian cells, its IFN-regulatory activity makes it anti-apoptotic [224].

The likely role of the NDV V protein has, however, been demonstrated using genetically modified viruses [235]. Thus, mutant viruses, defective for V protein expression (V\u2212 NDV), replicate poorly in embryonated eggs and chicken embryo fibroblasts. This defect can be complemented by transfection of a plasmid-expressing cDNA encoding the V protein into V\u2212 NDV-infected cells [235] or by insertion of the influenza virus NS1 gene into the V\u2212 NDV. The NS1 gene allows the modified NDV to replicate better in human cells than does the parental NDV, suggesting that the NDV V protein is more effective in modulating the chicken IFN system than the mammalian IFN system (unlike influenza NS1, which modulates both systems effectively).",

Although the positive-strand RNA viruses, and even poxviruses, generate some dsRNA during their replication and transcription, the dsRNA viruses must be able to prevent recognition of their dsRNA genome by the cell. This is probably largely achieved by ensuring that the genome is never exposed outside of the capsid within the cytoplasm. However, the avian reoviruses, in common with mammalian reoviruses, appear to encode a dsRNA-binding protein that can mask dsRNA from cellular dsRNA-binding proteins such as the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase PKR. The avian reovirus-coded S2-encoded \u03c3A protein functions like poxvirus E3 and can actually replace E3 in vaccinia virus [236].",

The induction of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter by virus infection alone is relatively strain-independent, but the ability of IBDV to inhibit transfected polyI:C-mediated induction of the promoter is pathotype-dependent (Laidlaw and Skinner, unpublished), as is the induction of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter in bursal tissue of IBDV-infected chickens [67]. The viral determinant has not been identified, but a study of IBDV inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 or Sendai virus-induced IFN expression in human HEK293T cells implicates the viral protease VP4, which is thought to interact with glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ), somehow stimulating its type I IFN suppressive activity. VP4 interacts with GILZ in a yeast-two-hybrid screen and co-localizes with it in the cell, and its IFN-suppressive activity is reduced if GILZ expression is reduced by siRNA [239]. It will be interesting to see whether the same mechanism operates in avian cells.",

However, during the last few years, and especially since the chicken genome has been sequenced, research has started to focus on interactions between virus infection and effects on the (de)regulation of immune responses. It is expected that rapid progress will be made in the next 5 to 10 years in this area of research.\n",

The recent derivation of the draft chicken genome sequence has opened up easier access to such reagents. It is likely that the coming years will see a rapid increase in the number of studies and hence an increase in our knowledge of the intricacies of avian virus\u2013host systems. Recent developments allowing manipulation of the large and complicated genome of infectious bronchitis virus [240], a coronavirus like the SARS virus, may also help identify additional viral immunomodulators and hopefully elucidate their mode of action 241., 242.. Such technology has been available for some time for avian adenoviruses, but the divergence between mammalian and avian adenoviruses has made it difficult to predict candidate immunomodulators. Hopefully, reannotation of the avian adenovirus CELO genome, which identified three putative surface glycoproteins with immunoglobulin-like folds, will be useful to further analysis [243].",

A high-yield broiler may hatch in an energy-depleted state and be subjected to suboptimal handling and transportation systems, and experience delays in acquiring nutrition, all while processing attenuated live vaccines that produce cytolytic infections. The brooding environment may not meet thermoneutrality, and placement on reused litter creates the potential for exposure to ammonia and potentially immunosuppressive agents (e.g., MD, chicken anemia and enteric viruses). With the decline of maternal immunity, active infection by IBDV can be permanently immunosuppressive at or before 14 days of age and, at least transiently, immunosuppressive when it occurs at an older age. Also, with declining maternal immunity, CIAV can produce a cytolytic infection in the thymus and contribute to the immunosuppression initiated by IBDV. Following this sequence, it is possible for immunocompetency to be compromised in a variable percentage of the flock. This can contribute to increased severity of infections by respiratory viruses and the ability to control secondary respiratory infections by E. coli. Coccidiosis and gangrenous dermatitis may likewise emerge as problems from 25 days of age and older. Collectively, this sequence of events occurs to variable degrees and influences livability, feed conversion, condemnation at processing and total production cost. Each immunosuppressive influence represents a control point to prevent immunosuppression and improve health and welfare.",
