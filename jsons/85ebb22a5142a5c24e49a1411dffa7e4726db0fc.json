Existing evidence suggests that the El protein subunit carries the fusion potential of the heterodimer, whereas the E2 subunit, or its intracellular precursor p62, is required for binding to the nucleocapsid. We show here that during virus uptake into acidic endosomes the LPHAVIRUSES, such as Semliki Forest virus (SFV)l and Sindbis virus, are enveloped animal viruses A IL which mature by budding at the plasma membrane (PM) ofinfected cells and enter new cells by an acid-induced membrane fusion process inside the endosomal compartment Schlesinger and Schlesinger, 1986) . Because of their simple structure and efficient replication these viruses represent useful systems for studying the molecular mechanisms of membrane budding and fusion. SFV directs the synthesis of three structural proteins, the capsid protein and two transmembrane glycoproteins, p62 and El (Garoff et al., 1982) . The capsid protein associates in the cell cytoplasm with the viral RNA genome into nucleocapsids (NCs). The two membrane proteins oligomerize soon after synthesis in the ER into p62E1 heterodimers and are then transported to the cell surface in order to take part in the budding process (Ziemiecki et al., 1980; Wahlberg et al., 1989) . In the released virus particles the heterodimers are clustered into groups of three, each representing a spikelike projection on the virus surface (Vogel et al., 1986; Fuller, 1987) . Furthermore, the original p62E1 heterodimer is processed by a limited proteolytic attack 66 residues from the NH2 terminus of p62 to form mature E2E1 complexes . This cleavage occurs at a very late stage during cell surface transport of the heterodimer and is probably mediated by a host protease (de Curtis and Simons, 1988 original E2E1 heterodimer is destabilized and the El proteins form new oligomers, presumably homooligomers, with altered El structure . This altered structure of El is specifically recognized by a monoclonal antibody which can also inhibit penetration of SFV into host cells as well as SFV mediated cell-cell fusion, thus suggesting that the altered El structure is important for the membrane fusion . These results give further support for a membrane protein oligomerization-mediated control mechanism for the membrane fusion potential in alphaviruses .",

The proximity of these two structures has been demonstrated in virus particles by chemical cross-linking, their structural complementarity has been shown by immunological techniques, and the binding has been verified biochemically in in vitro assays (Garoff and Simons, 1974; Vaux et al., 1988; Met-sikk6 and Garoff, 1990) . The last studies have furthermore emphasized the possible importance of the trimerization reaction for the formation ofthe spike structures as a way to obtain strong multivalent binding of membrane proteins to the NC. The entry functions of the virus (that is, receptor binding and membrane fusion activity) are, on the other hand, carried by the El subunit ofthe heterodimer. The most direct evidence for this was obtained in studies using virus particles from which essentially all of the E2 subunits had been digested by trypsin. Such particles were shown to be able to infect cells almost as efficiently as the control virus (Omar and Koblet, 1988) . In addition, the hemagglutinating activity ofthe virus has been shown to be a specific function of the El subunit (Helenius et al., 1976) .",

            "text": "The actual mechanism by which El catalyzes membrane fusion is not yet solved . This problem is ofparticular interest as the El-mediated membrane fusion process involves several differences as compared with that of the extensively studied hemagglutinin molecule (HA) of orthomyxoviruses as well as those of many other viral fusion proteins. First, the El fusion protein is made as part ofaprotein heterodimer as opposed to a homooligomer in the other cases. Second, in contrast to most other viral fusion proteins, the El protein of the alphaviruses is not processed by a cleavage reaction. This host-mediated cleavage reaction of a fusion protein seems to represent a fundamental control mechanism by which many viruses prevent activation of their entry functions during the assembly phase of the virus life cycle. Without such a control mechanism fusion proteins might cause aberrant fusion inside the mildly acidic compartments of the biosynthetic transport pathway (Anderson and Orci, 1988) . Third, El-catalyzed membrane fusion requires the presence of cholesterol in the acceptor membrane Kielian and Helenius, 1984) . This absolute restriction in lipid composition has not been observed for other viral fusion proteins. Apart from these unique features of the SFV fusogen it is well established that it requires induction by mildly acidic pH . By analogy with the low pH-induced changes of HA it is believed that the acidic pH alters the El structure into a form that is competent to perform a membrane fusion reaction. The fact that El changes into a trypsin-resistant form during entry into acidic endosomes and exposes new immunological epitopes as a result of low pH treatment might reflect this conformational change (Edwards et al., 1983; Helenius et al., 1985 ; Kielian and Helenius, 1985; Kielian et al., , 1990 ).",

This control is, however, directed by the p62 protein with which the El protein is associated. Thus, in the intracellular p62E1 form of the complex, the fusion function of El cannot be activated by mildly acidic conditions. This is not possible until after formation of the E2E1 complex through p62 cleavage . The control mechanism appears to involve a p62 cleavage-facilitated disruption of the heterodimeric association by mildly acidic pH. This suggests that the heterodimer has to dissociate before the El can be induced by low pH to convert into its fusion-active form.",

Endocytosis of bound virus was initiated by adding prewarrned (37\u00b0C) medium and incubating at 37\u00b0C . At different time points the cells were cooled on ice, the medium was removed, and 2 ml of cold PBS containing 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K (Bethesda Research Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) was added, followed by an incubation on ice for 45 min. In control experiments this treatment removed 96 % of the virus particles that had been bound to the surface of the cell and kept on ice. The reaction was stopped by adding 2 ml cold PBS containing 30 mg/ml BSA (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) and 1 mM PMSR The cells were pelleted (400 g for 3 min at 4\u00b0C), washed once with PBS containing 0.2 % BSA and 1 mM PMSF, and solubilized in 400 pl lysis buffer. Nuclei were removed (2,000 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C) and the radioactivity in the solubilized cell samples was measured in a scintillation counter. The lysates were used for immunoprecipitation analyses, trypsin digestions, and sedimentation analyses as described below. For the experiments using lysosomotrophic agents, 25 AM monensin (Sigma Chemical Co ., St . Louis, MO) was present during all incubation steps (Marsh et al ., 1982) .",

            "text": "Using this virus internalization protocol we first followed the fate ofthe viral spike protein oligomer E2E1 by performing sedimentation analyses in sucrose density gradients of cell samples that had been solubilized in an NP-40-containing buffer. These analyses enable the separation of different oligomeric forms of the spike subunits. Controls in Fig . 2 a show the separation of intact E2E1 heterodimers from solubilized virus (sedimentation coefficient of -4 .5 S) and the dissociated subunits that derive from virus that has been treated with an acidic (pH 5.5) buffer (Simons et al., 1973; Wahlberg et al., 1989) . Analysis of the solubilized spike proteins in virus particles that had been bound to cells and kept at 0\u00b0C showed that these migrated as the heterodimers in the control sample (Fig. 2 b) . However, this sedimentation profile underwent major changes upon 37\u00b0C incubation of the cellbound virus. Already after a 2-min incubation a considerable fraction of the spike proteins was distributed partly into monomers and partly into forms that were larger than the dimeric forms (Fig. 2 c) . This shift became even more pronounced in the cell sample that was incubated with virus for 5 or 10 min (Fig. 2 , d and e, and quantitation in Fig . 6 ). After longer times of incubation (20 and 30 min) the monomeric and dimeric material disappeared, whereas the larger oligomers were still clearly visible as a distinct peak (Fig. 2, fand  g) . Fig. 2 h shows a control experiment that was done to exclude an artefactual reorganization of the SFV spike oligomer in the sample during solubilization. Here virus particles were mixed with a cell solubilizate in vitro and then analyzed in a sucrose gradient . The result shows the presence of dimeric material only. Fig . 3 shows analyses by SDS-PAGE of the pooled fractions corresponding to each peak region of the gradient (Fig. 2 c) where the spike subunits were found (large oligomer, dimer, monomer regions) . These indicate that the dimer region contained both El and E2 subunits (lane 4), whereas the monomer region contained mainly E2 (lane S) and the large oligomer contained only El (lane 3). The trace amounts of faster migrating material also found in the monomer region represented El protein fragments corresponding to the lumenal domain of this protein. It reacted with the El antibody and could not be precipitated with TX-114 (data not shown) . These sedimentation analyses suggest that the E2E1 heterodimer in the virus particle is rearranged during virus uptake. The original E2E1 interaction is dis- or bound and internalized into BHK cells (c-g). The samples were run in a 5-20% (wt/wt) sucrose gradient for 24 h at 39,000 rpm and at 4\u00b0C in a SW40 rotor. Top fraction to the right. Control sample analyses in a represent unbound virus particles that were treated with buffers of neutral or acid pH before solubilization . Control sample in h shows free virus particles that were mixed with a solubilized cell sample before sedimentation.

After 10 min at 37\u00b0C almost 80% of the El proteins of internalized virus had obtained this new conformation (quantitation is shown in Fig. 6 ) .

Cell samples with virus which had been allowed to be internalized for different times (0, 2, 5, or 10 min) were solubilized and used for immunoprecipitation with a mixture of the monoclonal antibodies anti-El and anti-El\" to follow the total (T) El protein or with the anti-El\" alone (uF.r) to follow only El with the anti-El\" epitope . Immunoprecipitates were dissolved in SDS sample buffer and run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel .

Monensin treatment is known to raise the pH in intracellular organelles (Marsh et al., 1982) . For this reason cells with bound virus were incubated at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 25 pM monensin before solubilization . Viral proteins were then analyzed for the E2El heterodimer association using the coprecipitation assay with the anti-El antibody for reactivity toward the anti-El\" antibody and for trypsin resistance. Fig . 8 a shows that the presence of monensin caused E2 to coprecipitate with El and most of the El to stay trypsin-sensitive and unreactive to anti-Er. Thus we conclude that the observed tertiary and quaternary changes in El structure require the low pH which the virus encounters when entering the endosomes of the cell. This was further confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence analyses of cells incubated with SFV (Fig . 8 b) . The anti-El\" antibody gave a punctal staining pattern which probably represented the endosomal structures-(left) . This staining was completely abolished when 25 /AM monensin was present during the incubation (right) . The control anti-El antibody showed no difference in reactivity towards the El subunits of internalized virus particles in the presence or absence of monensin (not shown) .",

To test this we first made use of a previously described experimental protocol which allowed virus penetration to occur solely at the cell surface . Virus particles were bound to cells and penetration was induced directly at the PM by a 1-min incubation at 37\u00b0C in a pH 7.4, 6, or 5.5 buffer. Concomitantly, the activation of fusion in the endosomes was inhibited by the presence of 200 j,M chloroquine . The efficiency of virus penetration was es- Figure 7 .

Under conditions (3 pfu/cell and pH 5 .5 flash) in which virtually all of the cells could be infected via the PM route ( Fig . 9 i ) , we could demonstrate a significant inhibition when the anti-El\" monoclonal antibody was present during the flash (Fig. 9j and Table  I ) . This inhibitory effect was also evident after a wash with a pH 6 .0 buffer (Fig . 9f) . However, as pH 6.0 is close to the pH threshold for SFV fusion, the overall efficiency of SFV entry via the pM was lower. Without antibody the efficiency was r-50% of the efficiency of infection after a pH 5.5 treatment (Fig. 9 , e and i ). At both pH conditions the antibody had to be present during the low pH treatment in order to cause inhibition. No inhibition of infection was observed if the anti-El\" antibody was present during binding of the virus particles to the PM and then removed before the low pH flash (Fig. 9 b) . In contrast, the control monoclonal antibodies anti-El and anti-E2 (neutralizing antibodies; UM 8.139 and UM 5.1 ; Boere et al., 1984) inhibited infection when present before as well as during the low pH treatment (Fig . 9 , c, g, k; Table I ) . Additionally, the antiTR antibody did not decrease the number of infected cells if present during any of the incubations (Fig . 9 , d, h, l; Table I ) . No inhibition was observed for either a rabbit anti-mouse IgG preparation or a monoclonal antibody against the VSV G protein (not shown) .",

Inhibition was observedboth by the anti-El\" ascites preparation and by a IgG preparation (350 j ug/ml) purified from the anti-El\" ascites preparation (not shown) . We conclude that the anti-El\" antibody can interfere with virus penetration at the stage of membrane fusion, suggesting that the alterations in the spike proteins that we have observed are important for virus entry.",

Concomitant with the change in tertiary structure of the spike proteins, the El subunit undergoes conformational alterations as detected by the exposure of the anti-El\" epitope and by the previously described increased resistance of El towards trypsin digestion .",

It is possible that the El oligomer represents a fusion-competent form which corresponds to the low pH-activated form of the influenza virus HA molecule observed at 0\u00b0C (Stegmami et al., 1990) . In this fusion-competent HA the most prominent structural change appears to be the exposure of the hydrophobic peptide which constitutes the new N112 -terminus after maturation cleavage of HA . This so-called fusion peptide has been suggested to play a critical role in initiating the membrane fusion process of orthomyxoviruses. In the case of the SFV El protein the hydrophobic peptide spanning amino acid residues 79-97 might have an analogous function . This finding is supported by the fact that this amino acid sequence is very conserved between alphaviruses and also by the recent characterization of a Sindbis virus variant which has a mutation close to the gene region encoding the putative fusion peptide of El Rice and Strauss, 1981 ; Dalgarno et al., 1983; Boggs et al., 1989) . This mutation lowers the pH for fusion in in vitro assays from the normal value of 6.0 to 5.5. However, so far we have no information about whether this hydrophobic peptide is exposed in the new oligomeric form of the El protein .",

This is in clear contrast to the low pH-mediated disruption of the E2E1 interaction and the induction ofEl resistance to trypsin, both of which occur in vitro as well as in virus that has entered new cells. Apparently, acid treatment of SFV alone is not sufficient to induce all the conformational changes that take place in the viral spike proteins during entry. To accomplish these changes, simultaneous interaction with host membranes may be required . This might be related to the finding that the fusion process requires the presence of cholesterol or a 3\u00df-hydroxysterol in the target membrane Kielian and Helenius, 1984) . Recently, Flynn and co-workers have described several epitopes on the membrane proteins of Sindbis virus which react transiently with corresponding monoclonal antibodies . The exposure of this transient epitope also required prior binding of the virus particles to host membranes as well as incubation at 37\"C (Flynn et al., 1990) .",

These include the p62 cleavage at the stage of virus maturation , the exposure of unique (Flynn et al ., 1990) , and the low pH-induced changes observed during virus uptake, such as disruption of the E2E1 interaction, reorganization of the El protein, exposure of the epitope for the anti-El\" monoclonal antibody (this report), and the increased resistance of El toward trypsin digestion . These results are in agreement with a model for the activation of the El fusion protein in which the El subunit disrupts its original heterodimeric association and builds up anew oligomer, presumably a homooligomer, consisting of structurally altered El subunits . Thus the El fusion protein uses first heterodimerization with p62 as a means to become incorporated into the viral envelope and then dissociation from the cleaved p62 (E2) and reorganization, possibly with itself, as a way to become activated. This process of fusion protein maturation and activation differs considerably from that among most other enveloped viruses. For instance, in the cases of orthomyxo-, paramyxo-, retro-, and coronaviruses the proteins carrying entry functions already form homooligomeric structures soon after being synthesized within the ER of the infected cell . These preformed oligomers are then incorporated into the viral envelope and activated for fusion by either limited proteolysis or acidic pH or both (reviewed in Stegmann et al ., 1989; White, 1990 ).",
