First, microsatellite instability (MSI) testing was performed for all patients to avoid perioperative/adjuvant treatments in those with MSI-high, R0 resectable cancers.[7] Based on multidisciplinary team assessment, preoperative chemotherapy was recommended only for patients with age <70 years old and resectable high-risk disease. Oxaliplatin-based doublets were the treatment of choice for patients with node-positive disease assessed by both FDG-PET/TC scan and endoscopic ultrasonography, and for selected patients with cT3N0 tumours with adverse prognostic features (i.e. diffuse histotype) or technical risks of incomplete resection (i.e. gastroesophageal junction cancers). FLOT triplet chemotherapy, which is associated with increased survival at the cost of a higher risk of toxicity,[8] was recommended only for cT4 tumours and in those cases with unacceptable risk of positive (R1/R2) tumour margins. For patients with gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, the use of neoadjuvant chemoradiation was discouraged even for Siewert 1-2 tumours. Regarding postoperative chemotherapy, we carefully assessed the patient\u2019s health condition and nutritional status after gastrectomy and the choice between adjuvant single-agent fluoropyrimidines (capecitabine) or CAPOX (capecitabine plus oxaliplatin) was made based on pathological stage and individual risk of relapse.[9, 10]",

Given the limited overall survival advantage provided by triplet chemotherapy at the cost price of significant toxicity, doublet regimens are usually preferred in the clinical practice. Moreover, the administration of cisplatin requires protracted hydration and may cause severe vomiting, nephrotoxicity and grade 3-4 neutropenia worthy of hospital admissions or intravenous supportive treatments. Several studies demonstrated the non-inferiority of oxaliplatin compared to cisplatin as part of combination regimens.[11, 12] Therefore, the choice of CAPOX regimen was preferred over FOLFOX thanks to its three-weekly schedule and the oral administration of fluoropyrimidine, with no need for infusion pumps and central venous catheters.[11, 12, 13] For dysphagic patients needing nutritional support, initial treatment with FOLFOX infusional regimen was shifted to CAPOX as soon as the symptoms\u2019 resolution allowed it.",

COVID-19 created a reality where we needed to decide almost immediately on what is important and what is of less importance, instead of taking very careful decisions based on large trials and thoughtful discussions as we, like most oncologists, are used to do.
