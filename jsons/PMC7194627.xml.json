China's first major outbreaks of COVID-19 happened in January, 2020. Then South Korea, Iran, and Italy entered into this Ravel's Bolero-like epidemic in late February and early March, 2020, and many other countries are preparing to play the same rhythmic pattern in the coming days and weeks.",

Although starting late in the process, authoritarian Chinese authorities succeeded in combining forced isolation of the population with all available social distancing interventions. The democratic Italian Government, followed by the governments of France, Spain, and other countries, set up most of these measures quickly in the epidemic process but lacked any international guidance or recommendations. Would they not have expected to see WHO headquarters as the orchestra conductor at this stage of the process? Do Member States not need some level of harmonisation and coordination when implementing the four available non-pharmaceutical interventions; to help them decide whether, when, and how to implement them; if, when, and how to combine them; and to what extent? In addition, the Chinese Government has no guidance nor recommendation about lifting measures that have been in place in Wuhan since Jan 23, 2020. To what extent, at which pace, and how should they start lifting their intervention and allow people to resume normal social and economic life?",
