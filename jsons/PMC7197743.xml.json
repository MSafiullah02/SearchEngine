When properly treated, biosolids can be used as an amendment to improve the chemical and physical properties of soil (EPA 2000b). Transmission of enteric viruses known to be present in wastewater residues, such as hepatitis A virus (HAV), reoviruses (REOs), adenoviruses and noroviruses, via biosolids (EPA 2003) is of particular concern. As a result of their small size, enteric viruses easily infiltrate soils, where upon favourable pH and moisture conditions, they can migrate through the subsurface environment, contaminate groundwater (Borchardt et al. 2003) and penetrate the roots of edible plants (Oron et al. 1995), thereby posing a potential public health threat. Most data regarding the potential of enteric viruses to contaminate groundwater and their persistence during treatment of wastewater residues come from experimentation with their current indicator, enteroviruses (EVs), a subpopulation of the enteric virus group.",

Recent studies have shown the level of detectable polioviruses, once thought to be the most numerous of the EVs, is low in comparison with more host restrictive EVs, not easily detected by the plaque assay method specified under the CFR part 503 (Sedmak et al. 2003). The reduction of polioviruses in the environment and limited ability to detect nonpoliovirus EVs using the CFR part 503 methods suggest that EVs may no longer be an appropriate indicator for the presence and persistence of enteric viruses in wastewater residues intended for land application as biosolids.",

Clinical cases of enteric viral disease should therefore correlate to an increase in the offending agents\u2019 presence within wastewater residues. Noroviruses, coronaviruses and HAV were not primary concerns during the development of the pathogen standards governing biosolids, but have since been documented as causative agents of serious and highly communicable illnesses. The recent surge in clinical cases caused by these enteric viruses emphasizes the need to determine whether the current indicator, EVs, can accurately predict their presence in biosolids and persistence during treatment (Wang et al. 2005; Colomba et al. 2006; Fiaccadori et al. 2006).",

HAV demonstrates a high level of resistance to inactivation by chemicals (Li et al. 2002), heat (Sobsey et al. 1986) and has survived for longer periods of time than EVs in experimentally contaminated freshwater, seawater, wastewater and soils (Sobsey et al. 1988). The ubiquity of HAV in biosolids has not been well characterized as wild\u2010type virus rarely exhibits cytopathic effects (CPE) in cell culture and replicates slowly (Graff et al. 1993) making it unlikely to be detected by the CFR part 503 method (EPA 2003). Recent studies utilizing molecular methods of detection indicate that HAV levels can exceed those of EVs in waters contaminated by sewage (Gersberg et al. 2006). These data suggest that HAV may be prevalent in wastewater residues and persist in treated biosolids following the inactivation of EVs.",

Mammalian REOs commonly infect livestock, which serve as the primary reservoir for human infection and contribute to the high frequency by which REOs are isolated from water (Sattar and Springthorpe 1999). REO infections in humans are often asymptomatic, mimicking commonly encountered minor respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses (Jackson and Muldoon 1973), but have been suggested to infrequently cause serious infections in children (Lerner et al. 1962; Tyler et al. 1998). REOs shed by infected humans are commonly isolated from secondary sewage effluent (Irving and Smith 1981) and raw sewage (Havelaar et al. 1993), where they have been shown to be more resistant to temperature (Ward and Ashley 1978) and chemicals inactivation than EVs.

EVs, specifically polioviruses, were ideal indicators for the presence of enteric viruses when the CFR Part 503 regulations were first promulgated in 1993, especially those viruses not easily detected or quantified by available methods. Advancements in environmental virology have made it possible to more readily detect enteric viruses in the environment as well as evaluate their ubiquity and levels of resistance to traditional treatment methodologies. Numerous studies support the hypothesis that EVs are no longer the most ubiquitous viruses in the various matrices that they were once thought to be (Irving and Smith 1981; Havelaar et al. 1993; Sedmak et al. 2003), nor are EVs the most difficult to inactivate (Ward and Ashley 1978; Sobsey et al. 1986; Tree et al. 2003). Alternatively, phages such as MS2 are present at higher concentrations in wastewater residuals than anthropogenic viruses (Calci et al. 1998), detected by cost\u2010efficient and rapid assays and have been found less susceptible to chemical inactivation than EVs (Tree et al. 2003). This study sought to compare the inactivation rates of MS2, T1 L and HM\u2010175, during alkaline stabilization of wastewater residues and evaluate the potential of MS2 to serve as an indicator for the persistence of these enteric viruses in treated biosolids.",

Pathogen inactivation under these conditions comes from the hydroxide alkalinity of the liming material added with further reduction in contaminants via flocculation or flotation (Grabow et al. 1978). Previous studies have shown that alkaline stabilization performed under class B conditions for 24 h at 4 and 28\u00b0C significantly reduces the level of seeded poliovirus (Sattar et al. 1976), adenovirus, rotavirus and MS2 (Hansen et al. 2007). Our findings, utilizing a bench scale model, also demonstrate that 24 h of alkaline stabilization is an effective treatment for the reduction of MS2, as well as T1 L and HM\u2010175 (Table 1).",

(2007) suggests that MS2 could serve as an indicator for the presence and persistence of rotavirus Wa and adenovirus 5 during alkaline stabilization as they appeared to be inactivated at a similar rate. By comparing the concentrations of virus at each time point during stabilization, allowing one to generalize the inactivation rates as similar or dissimilar, the study also found MS2 to have a similar inactivation rate to T1 L and HM\u2010175 following alkaline stabilization at 28\u00b0C as well as T1 L at 4\u00b0C. These results suggest that MS2 could serve as an indicator for the presence of T1 L and HM\u2010175 following alkaline stabilization performed within enclosed facilities at moderate temperatures. Alternatively, it is questionable whether MS2 is inactivated similarly to HM\u2010175 at 4\u00b0C as there was large variation during the three trials leading to a significant difference in their inactivation at 0\u00b71 and 2 h. The variation between trials may have been the result of inadequate pH maintenance or phage\u2010specific anti\u2010viral components within the sludge affecting both the test and the control samples. Regardless of the cause of variation, MS2 cannot be suggested as an adequate indicator for the presence of HM\u2010175 during alkaline stabilization at reduced temperatures.",

Therefore, a lack of plaque formation using one cell line does not indicate a complete loss of infectivity.
