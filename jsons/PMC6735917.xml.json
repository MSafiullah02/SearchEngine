            "text": "Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is a gene expression mechanism whereby a proportion of translating ribosomes are stimulated to shift into an alternative reading frame at a specific site during the decoding of an mRNA (1). Ribosomes which frameshift produce an alternative protein product that is N-terminally coincident with the product of standard decoding but has a distinct C-terminal region encoded by either the +1 or the \u22121 reading frame depending on the type of frameshifting. In viruses, the most common type of PRF involves \u22121 nt tandem slippage of the P- and A-site tRNAs on the mRNA (\u22121 PRF). Many viruses use \u22121 PRF to express the viral polymerase at a set ratio with other components of the replication complex, with examples including HIV and other retroviruses, SARS and other coronaviruses, and many plant RNA viruses (1). Other viruses use \u22121 PRF to append an extension domain onto a proportion of their capsid proteins (e.g. (2,3)), or to express accessory proteins (e.g. (4,5)). A number of cellular genes also utilize \u22121 PRF in their expression, both in eukaryotes (6,7) and in bacteria (8,9).",

Such sites allow for P- and A-site anticodon:codon re-pairing following a \u22121 nt shift, except potentially at the wobble positions. It should be noted that the requirement for re-pairing is weaker in the P-site and a number of exceptions to XXX occur, such as GGU, GUU, GUC, GAA, GGA and UCC (1). While such slippery heptanucleotides may allow frameshifting of up to \u223c1\u20132% (for some sequences), in order to achieve a high efficiency, an extra stimulator is required and this normally takes the form of a 3\u2032 stable RNA stem\u2013loop or pseudoknot structure separated from the shift site by a \u2018spacer\u2019 region of 5\u20139 nt. Structures of this type are thought to be located at the mRNA unwinding site of the ribosome entrance channel when their stimulatory effect is exerted (10). How the stimulatory RNAs function to promote \u22121 PRF is still uncertain, but accumulating evidence from prokaryotic counterparts indicates that the RNA structure impedes back rotation of the ribosomal small subunit, trapping the ribosome in a rotated or hyper-rotated state (11,12). This stalled state can be resolved either via spontaneous unwinding of the structure or via a \u22121 PRF which, by repositioning the structure within the mRNA entrance channel, is thought to allow for more efficient unwinding by the ribosome (11).",

            "text": "Intra-mRNA structures normally lead to a fixed ratio of frameshifting, ideal for controlling stoichiometry of different components of the replication complex or different structural proteins. Recent work with porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV) (family: Arteriviridae) uncovered a new case of PRF where the stimulator involves, not an intra-mRNA structure separated from the shift site by a 5\u20139 nt spacer, but instead a protein binding site (CCCANCUCC) separated from the shift site by a 10-nt spacer (13\u201315). The viral protein nsp1\u03b2 together with host poly(C) binding proteins (PCBPs) bind at this site, and the RNA:protein complex positioned at the leading edge of the ribosome when the decoding centre is positioned on the shift site is sufficient to stimulate \u223c20% efficient \u22122 PRF and \u223c7% efficient \u22121 PRF in virus-infected cells. Even higher levels (up to \u223c50% \u22122 PRF) have been observed in a recombinant vaccinia virus/T7 polymerase expression system. More recently, a completely independent case of protein-stimulated PRF was identified in encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) (family Picornaviridae; genus Cardiovirus) where the viral 2A protein binds to an RNA stem\u2013loop structure separated from the shift site by a 13-nt spacer (16\u201318). Ribosome profiling analyses showed that this RNA:protein complex strongly impedes ribosome progress but that this impediment can be relieved by ribosomes shifting to the \u22121 reading frame on the G_GUU_UUU shift site. Cellular levels of 2A build up strongly between 4 and 6 h post infection (p.i.), and this correlates with a switch in frameshifting efficiency from negligible levels at 2 and 4 h p.i. to \u223c70% at 6 and 8 h p.i., making this one of the most efficient cases of \u22121 PRF in a mammalian cell system and the only case known to be temporally modulated.",

            "text": "To date, despite there being hundreds of identified cases of RNA-structure stimulated PRF, these are the only two known cases of protein-stimulated PRF. Our previous work on protein-stimulated PRF in genus Cardiovirus focused on EMCV. Another well-studied member of this genus is Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV). The EMCV G_GUU_UUU frameshift site is conserved in TMEV, as is the presence of a 3\u2032 stem\u2013loop structure separated from the shift site by a 13-nt (EMCV) or 14-nt (TMEV) spacer. In TMEV, however, the stem\u2013loop is more compact with a 10-nt loop compared to a 21-nt loop (albeit probably containing internal structure) in EMCV. Further, the TMEV 2A protein shares only \u223c27% aa identity with the EMCV 2A protein. The late-timepoint PRF efficiencies in virus-infected cells have previously been measured at \u223c70% in EMCV (by ribosome profiling) and 74\u201382% in TMEV (by metabolic labelling, which may be less accurate). However, the role of TMEV 2A in the stimulation of PRF on the TMEV mRNA has not been studied, nor has the ability of TMEV 2A to cross-activate EMCV PRF, or vice versa.",

We show that the TMEV 2A protein stimulates frameshifting on the TMEV mRNA and to a level in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) cell-free translations considerably higher than observed previously with the EMCV 2A protein at the EMCV signal. Thus, TMEV may be a more tractable in vitro system for future structural and biophysical studies of 2A action. We show that TMEV 2A stimulates efficient PRF on both EMCV and TMEV mRNAs whereas EMCV 2A is active only on the cognate EMCV mRNA. Since 2A is known to interact with the viral L protein, we tested whether EMCV L has an effect on EMCV PRF but found none. We also performed an extensive mutational analysis of protein and RNA stimulators of TMEV PRF and tested the effects of these mutations in in vitro translation, electrophoretic mobility shift (EMSA) and in vitro ribosome pausing assays. The predicted TMEV RNA stem\u2013loop structure was verified with chemical and enzymatic structure probing. Finally a 2A mutant defective in RNA binding was introduced into the virus genome and tested in the context of infection. Our results confirm the role of 2A in stimulating PRF at the TMEV signal and substantially extend previous characterization of cardiovirus frameshifting stimulators.",

We titrated recombinant TMEV 2A protein into a wheat germ extract (WG) cell-free translation system programmed with a dual luciferase-based reporter mRNA containing the TMEV PRF signal. Following previous work (16), we engineered a U to C change in the loop of the stimulatory RNA to remove the \u22121 frame UAA stop codon, so that ribosomes which frameshift read into the downstream reporter gene (Figure 1A). Increasing amounts of 2A led to a general inhibition of cap-dependent translation, as reported previously for EMCV 2A (Figure 1B) (26,27). When the reporter was translated in the absence of 2A, only \u223c1% PRF was observed (Figure 1B, lane DB). However in the presence of 2A, efficient PRF was observed, to a level of \u223c20% with increasing amounts of 2A (Figure 1B and C). Similar results were observed in RRL, except that the PRF efficiency plateaued at a higher level (\u223c58%; Figure 1D and E). As a control, we confirmed that inactivation of the slippery sequence (G_GUU_UUU to A_GUG_UUU mutation; SS mutant) reduced frameshifting to background levels in both WG and RRL (Figure 2A). To test whether 2A stimulation was specific to the cardiovirus PRF signal, reporter mRNAs containing the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV; family Retroviridae) or infectious bronchitis virus (IBV; family Coronaviridae) frameshift signals (28) were translated in WG or RRL with or without recombinant TMEV 2A protein. For these signals, addition of 2A had no stimulatory effect on PRF efficiency (Figure 2B).",

We also generated another reporter mRNA (TG5; \u2018TMEV GFP 5\u2032\u2019) which was similar except that the 480 nt + 3\u2032 UTR + poly(A) region was omitted. Our rationale for including these sequences was that (a) 3\u2032 UTRs often contain regulatory elements, (b) our earlier analysis of synonymous site conservation in an alignment of TMEV-related cardiovirus sequences revealed conserved overlapping elements (potentially RNA signals) in the 3\u2032 region of the polyprotein ORF (Figure 1B of (17)), and (c) although this analysis also suggested that there were no additional conserved elements 3\u2032-proximal to the shift site other than what was already included in our original reporter construct above (containing the shift site and 92 nt of 3\u2032-adjacent sequence) we reasoned that including additional TMEV-derived 3\u2032-proximal sequence might reduce the potential for spurious base-pairing interactions between the 3\u2032 stem\u2013loop and either vector sequence in the original construct or the TMEV far 3\u2032-sequences in the new construct, which might impact PRF efficiency.",

A completely conserved CCC triplet in the loop is important for 2A binding in EMCV (18). The EMCV stem\u2013loop structure is supported by enzymatic and chemical structure probing, and a mutational analysis has shown it to be critical for PRF stimulation (18,30). To provide support for the predicted stem\u2013loop structure in TMEV we performed chemical and enzymatic structure probing (Figure 3). Short, 33P-labelled RNAs (105 nt) containing the TMEV PRF region (shift site plus 29 nt upstream and 69 nt downstream) were treated with chemical (imidazole, lead acetate; which show specificity for single-stranded regions) or enzymatic (RNase T1; cuts single-standed RNA after G residues) probes. The cleavage pattern of the RNA was generally consistent with the proposed stem\u2013loop structure, although the upper portion of the 3\u2032 arm of the proposed duplex stem was accessible to the single-stranded chemical probes. Single-stranded probe cleavage was especially evident in the slippery sequence and the A-triplet in the loop region.",

In these mutants we altered the 5\u2032 part or the 3\u2032 part of the stem to disrupt base-pairing, or altered both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 parts together to restore the predicted duplex but with altered base-pairings at the three basal positions. However the TMEV loop region was not analysed, and only a limited analysis has been performed in EMCV (namely mutations to the CCC triplet; (18)). Therefore we performed a mutational analysis of the TMEV loop region (Figure 4A). Mutation of any nucleotide of the CCC triplet (C50U, C51U, C52U, C50\u201352A) greatly diminished PRF in both WG and RRL (Figure 4B and C). Of these, C52U was consistently less inhibitory than the other mutations. Additional mutations within the CCC triplet (C50A, C51A, C51G, C52A; tested only in RRL) also nearly completely abolished PRF (Figure 4D). In contrast, mutating the 5\u2032 adjacent AAA triplet (A47U, A46\u201348U) that is conserved in TMEV and related viruses (Saffold, rat theilovirus) and most, but not all, EMCV isolates (Supplementary Figure S3a of (18)), had little (A47U) or only modest (A46\u201348U; \u223c1.3-fold reduction in both WG and RRL) effect on PRF. Similarly, the mutation A42U which separated the apical base-pair of the duplex had little effect on PRF. Increasing the loop length by 3 nt (+GAG) had only a modest effect on PRF (\u223c1.3- and \u223c1.6-fold reduction in WG and RRL, respectively). We also mutated the first A of the loop to G (UA/A43G) to, potentially, extend the stem duplex by 1 bp by base-pairing with the 3\u2032 C of the CCC triplet (the A43G mutation was performed in the context of the apical base-pair A\u00b7U to U\u00b7A mutation, termed \u2018UA\u2019; see below). Similar to the +GAG mutation, this had little effect on PRF in WG and led to only a \u223c1.6-fold reduction in RRL.",

To facilitate this analysis, we removed the stop codons by flipping the apical base-pair of the stem from A\u00b7U to U\u00b7A, a variation which is naturally present in rat theilovirus (e.g. GenBank accession EU542581; see also Supplementary Figure S3A of (18)). This mutation (termed \u2018UA\u2019) alone had little effect on PRF (Figure 5B and C; lane 6). Changes in reading frame as a result of spacer mutations were further compensated by additional single-nucleotide insertions or deletions downstream of the stem\u2013loop so that the 0, \u22121 and \u22122 frame products would migrate at approximately the same positions for all mutants. In the context of the UA mutation, increasing the spacer length by 1 nucleotide (UA/+C28) reduced \u22121 PRF 3\u20135 fold. In RRL, decreasing the spacer by 1 nt (UA/\u2212A29) reduced \u22121 PRF 4-fold (12%, cf. 48% for UA alone) but also led to a high levels of \u22122 PRF (16%) (Figure 5C). The appearance of a \u22122 PRF product is consistent with previous observations of the effect of spacer length mutations in RNA-structure stimulated PRF, where there is potential for (at least) A-site codon:anticodon re-pairing in the \u22122 frame (31). In contrast, in WG, decreasing the spacer length by a single nucleotide (UA/\u2212A29) had no effect on \u22121 PRF (16%, cf. 16% for UA alone) and did not lead to noticeable levels of \u22122 PRF (Figure 5B). Such differences between the in vitro translation systems may be a consequence of the slightly smaller footprint of plant ribosomes (32,33). We made additional single-nucleotide deletions, UA/\u2212G24, UA/\u2212C25 and UA/\u2212A27. Similar to the UA/\u2212A29 mutation, these had only a small to modest effect on PRF in WG (Figure 5D) but resulted in a 4\u20135 fold reduction in \u22121 PRF and high levels of \u22122 PRF in RRL (Figure 5E). Interestingly, the UA/\u2212G24 mutant had a substantially higher level of \u22122 PRF than, for example, the UA/\u2212A29 mutant (41% compared to 18%). It is not clear why this would be the case, but it may be related to effects on chain length from the base composition of the remaining spacer. The UU_UUU section of the TMEV shift site is compatible with A-site re-pairing following a \u22122 nt shift but the pentanucleotide CG_GUU does not allow obvious P-site re-pairing. We wondered whether the presence of a 5\u2032 pyrimidine (C) might inhibit \u22122 PRF occurring on the wildtype (WT) PRF signal. Notably, \u22122 PRF in PRRSV (see Introduction) occurs on an RG_GUU_UUU shift site (R = purine). However when we mutated the 5\u2032 C to G in the TMEV PRF signal (C14G) we did not see appreciable levels of \u22122 PRF for the WT spacer length (Figure 5B and C).",

Thus we wondered whether the TMEV 2A protein would be able to trans-activate PRF on the EMCV PRF signal and/or vice versa. RNAs containing the EMCV or TMEV WT PRF signals were translated in RRL in the presence of EMCV or TMEV 2A (Figure 6A). Previously, EMCV 2A was found to stimulate PRF to levels of \u223c14\u201317% at the EMCV PRF signal in RRL and this level was recapitulated here (17%, lane 2). TMEV 2A was able to stimulate similar levels of PRF at the EMCV PRF signal (16%, lane 1). On the other hand, whereas TMEV 2A stimulated efficient PRF at the TMEV PRF signal (53%, lane 6), stimulation by EMCV 2A was only slightly above background (1.2%, lane 7). Thus TMEV 2A can efficiently trans-activate PRF at the EMCV PRF signal, but not vice versa.",

In contrast, a much more modest pause was observed on the WT shift site G_GUU_UUU. Greatly enhanced pausing on a mutated shift site was also apparent in an in vitro pausing assay using a reporter construct (Figure 10A) containing the EMCV frameshift sequence translated in the presence of recombinant EMCV 2A protein. To test whether these results extend to TMEV, we translated in wheat germ (WG) a reporter construct containing the WT or SS, TMEV or EMCV frameshift sequence in the presence of recombinant TMEV or EMCV 2A (authentic C-terminus) or TMEV 2A-mut (C-terminally extended version). The extent of pausing was assessed by comparing the levels of a translational intermediate corresponding to pausing at the shift site with that of the full-length polypeptide (and also the frameshift product, where applicable). Translation was synchronized by the addition of edeine, a potent inhibitor of initiation, 5 min after the start of the reaction and pausing was monitored over a time course.",

In contrast, no pausing was observed when either RNA was translated in the presence of TMEV 2A-mut (Figure 10D and E). We also tested for cross-activation between EMCV and TMEV, using the shift site mutant RNAs and the WT 2A proteins. As previously seen, translation of EMCV SS RNA in the presence of EMCV 2A leads to a very protracted pause (Figure 10F). TMEV 2A was also able to induce pausing on EMCV SS RNA (Figure 10G); however the pausing induced by TMEV 2A on EMCV SS RNA was much less pronounced than that induced by EMCV 2A. On the other hand, EMCV 2A was unable to induce pausing on TMEV SS RNA (Figure 10H). Thus the pausing assays are consistent with the frameshifting assays, where TMEV 2A can stimulate efficient PRF on EMCV WT RNA but not vice versa (Figure 6A).",

Previous work showed that the efficiency of \u22121 PRF in EMCV increases from negligible levels at 2 and 4 h p.i. to \u223c70% at 6 and 8 h p.i, presumably as a result of increasing cytoplasmic levels of 2A (18). Thus \u22121 PRF in EMCV plays a dual role in (i) allowing late timepoint expression of the 14 kDa 2B* protein, and (ii) down-regulating enzymatic protein expression by \u223c3-fold at late timepoints. In contrast, the 2B* protein in TMEV has only 14 aa, and currently there is no evidence that the peptide is functional (16). Thus, \u22121 PRF in TMEV may play the singular role of down-regulating enzymatic protein expression at late timepoints. Metabolic labelling indicates that the down-regulation in TMEV may be \u223c5-fold\u2014even stronger than in EMCV. As discussed previously, this provides the virus with an elegant solution to build up replication capacity at early timepoints, while favouring structural protein synthesis at late timepoints (18).",

Early in infection, 2A is targeted to the nucleus and nucleolus (26). 2A also binds the virus L protein and is thought to shuttle it to the nucleus, where L directs hyperphosphorylation of nuclear pore proteins resulting in inhibition of active nucleocytoplasmic trafficking (34\u201336). At later timepoints, 2A accumulates in the cytoplasm where it exhibits a diffuse distribution (26). 2A also plays a role in shutoff of cap-dependent translation although the mechanism remains elusive (26,27). A portion of 2A also associates with cytoplasmic 40S but not 80S ribosomes (41). More than 40 years ago, 2A was shown to exhibit non-specific RNA binding activity (37), and we now show that it has enhanced specificity for the cardiovirus PRF stem\u2013loop with a CCC loop triplet being a key part of the recognition motif.",

The large difference between WG (\u223c20%) and RRL (\u223c58%) for the TMEV PRF signal is likely related to structural differences between plant and animal ribosomes (e.g. plant ribosomes have a slightly smaller footprint than mammalian ribosomes) which may affect the geometry of the interaction between the ribosome and the 2A:stem\u2013loop complex; though in principle it could also be due to other host factors (e.g. host proteins) being involved. In contrast, much smaller differences were seen between WG and RRL for the EMCV system (16\u201321% compared to 14\u201320%; (18)). The larger size of the EMCV stem\u2013loop and the EMCV 2A protein may be responsible for this different behaviour. By analogy, in arterivirus protein-stimulated PRF, the efficiency of PRF (both \u22121 and \u22122) is sensitive to whether PCBP1 or PCBP2 is used as the stimulator, and relative efficiencies also vary between WG and RRL systems (15).",

The ability to reconstitute PRF in WG, despite high divergence between plant and animal proteomes, also suggests that no additional host proteins are involved. In contrast, arterivirus protein-stimulated PRF can only be reconstituted in WG with the addition of both the viral trans-activator (nsp1\u03b2) and mammalian PCBP (15).

(A) RNA was 5\u2032-end-labelled with [\u03b3-33P] ATP and subjected to limited RNase or chemical cleavage using structure-specific probes. Sites of cleavage were identified by comparison with a ladder of bands created by limited alkaline hydrolysis of the RNA (OH\u2212; RNA heated to 100\u00b0C for 95 s [left lane] or 165 s [right lane]). Enzymatic probing employed RNase T1 (at 1, 10 and 100 U/mL) which preferentially cleaves after G bases in single-stranded regions. Chemical probing was with imidazole (2, 4 and 6 h exposure), or lead acetate (PbOAc; 10, 20 and 50 mM concentration in reaction), which show specificity for single-stranded regions. Uniquely cleaved nucleotides were identified by their absence in untreated control lanes (C). The regions corresponding to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 part of the stem\u2013loop duplex are indicated.
