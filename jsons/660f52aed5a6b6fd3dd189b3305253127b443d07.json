Our study shows that females constituted the majority of confirmed cases, whereas males accounted for most of the confirmed cases in China and Italy. [6] [7] [8] [9] Around a fourth of the cases were from 20-29 years age group unlike in most other countries where the infected were older. 6, 7 The possible reason for higher representation of younger population in our sample could be specific exposure to cluster of cases through participation in religious activities or workplaces. 5, 10 The case fatality rate was much lower (2.1%) compared to other countries such as Italy (13.3%) and China (4%). Similar to findings from several other countries, we found the elderly to be more vulnerable with lower probabilities of recovery. 6, 8, 11 It is quite possible that presence of pre-existing medical conditions in elderly predispose them to delayed recovery. We also found cases contracting the infection in non-healthcare setting had higher recovery. While there is no such evidence currently, there could be a possibility that the exposure outside non-healthcare setting might have involved relative younger and healthier cases. Considering our study findings, we suggest additional measures to protect the vulnerable cases who are less likely to recover from the infection. Thus, elderly and cases contracting infection from healthcare settings should be given special attention.",
