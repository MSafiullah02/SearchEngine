As of February 20, 2020, it has caused more than 75,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases in China [1] . The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 have been known through previous reports. According to Huang et al., COVID-19 patients had fever, myalgia ,fatigue and dry cough [2] [2] [2] . But apart from the typical symptoms, there wereasymptomatic patients and atypical symptoms, such as diarrhea and headache [3] .Although most patients were considered to have a good prognosis, elderly patients and patients with chronic underlying diseases or severe clinical symptoms may have a poor prognosis [4] . In addition, high SOFA scores and d-dimers greater than 1 \u00b5g / L might serve as risk factors to help clinicians identify patients with poor prognosis early [5] .",

Generally, malnutrition is considered an indicator related to increased morbidity and mortalitys [6] . Therefore, the assessments of early nutritional status of different diseases are important means to identify malnutrition, nutritional risks, and possible benefit to nutritional interventions, as well as a prerequisite for guiding nutritional treatment plans. Ideal nutritional risk screening tools and nutrition assessment methods should accurately reflect the nutritional status of the body and predict the occurrence of malnutrition-related complications. Traditional measurement methods, such as height or body mass index (BMI) or laboratory indicators, such as albumin, prealbumin and total cholesterol levels, have been used to assess the nutritional status of individuals [7] . However, they are limited to reflecting a small portion of nutritional risks and cannot be comprehensive assessement .Interestingly, some studies have shown that malnutrition is linked to the inflammatory response of chronic diseases and the development of autoimmune diseases. At the same time, abnormal nutritional status is related to the prognosis of malignancies and other diseases, such as heart failure, adult spinal deformity and RA [8, 9, 10, 11, 12] . Therefore, understanding nutritional status aims to elucidate the prognostic significance of various diseases. This suggests that assessing nutritional status has clinical significance nutritional status on the outcome of COVID-19 patients. Current assessments of the serious consequences and risk factors for death of COVID-19 are not numerous and limitative [19] . Therefore, the purpose of this study was to (i) investigate the relationship between two different nutritional indices and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19, and (ii) evaluate the prognostic effect of these indicators as predictors of adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients",

However, in the multivariable logistic regression analysis,theCONUT score and PNI were the independent predictors of all-cause death,individually.According to the area under the curve of ROC,PNI was a better predictor of all-cause death than the COUNT score. In addition,according to the categorical groups of PNI, severe group was an independent predictor ofall-cause death.

Studies have suggested that albumin and lymphocyte percentage might be predictors of disease severity [29] . The CONUT score weights are relatively equal between serum albumin, lymphocyte counts, and total cholesterol levels, while PNI is mainly determined by serum albumin levels and lymphocyte counts. In addition, considering that lymphocyte counts have been associated with increased disease severity. Furthermore, the lymphocytes of patients who died of COVID-19 were reported to be significantly lower than those of survivors [30] .These supported our research results,whichsuggested that among the nutrition indicators, COUNT score and PNI wererelated to death.. It has been found that some parameters are related to the prognosis of COVID-19 patients.Previously, according to the research, elderly age was an important independent predictor of death in patients with SARS and MERS [31] . Currently \uff0c COVID-19 study also confirmed that patient's age was concerning with death. Increasing age was a predictor, which was consistent with age-related mortality study with an OR of 1.10 [5] . Older age might be associated with more complications, which increased the mortality rate. In one study, predictors related to 30-day mortality included older, non-healthcare workers, pre-existing conditions, disease severity, and hospital-acquired infections [31] .Interestingly, BMI was originally considered only as a way to measure body composition, but now obesity is considered a chronic inflammatory state that may affect the immune system through fat-derived inflammation [32] . COVID-19 was currently considered to have potential complex immunological damage [30] . However, in this study, BMI itself significantly differed between the death and survival groups in univariate logistics analysis model. In fact, whether BMI can be used as an evaluation index to evaluate the nutritional status of COVID-19 patients requires further study.It is unclear whether individual parameters (such as serum albumin, blood lipids, vitamins) can be used to assess the nutritional status of COVID-19 patients to predict adverse outcomes.But these single parameter indicators may also be needed to support our conclusions, especially blood lipids and albumin .The advantage of this study was that, to the author's knowledge, this was the first study to assess the clinical significance of different nutritional indicators in patients with COVID-19. Our research will help clinicians to pay attention to the assessment of nutritional status of COVID-19 patients for early intervention and early treatment of COVID-19 patients with poor nutritional status.",

This study might have included disproportionately more patients with poor outcomes. There might also be a selection bias when identifying factors that influence the clinical outcomes.",
