Clinical data of COVID-19 patients diagnosed between January 28, 2020 and February 23, 2020 at the Beijing You'an Hospital were summarised and analysed. Overall, 45 (18 men and 27 women) patients were included in this study. The average age of patients was 58 years (range, 7-94 years). Furthermore, 21 patients (47%) experienced underlying chronic diseases, with onother four patients (9%) having three or more chronic diseases simultaneously. The first symptoms appeared at the onset of illness onset include fever in 36 patients (80%), cough in 23 patients (51%), and expectoration in 15 patients (33%), respectively. Patients may experience hepatic and renal injury as well as abnormal myocardial enzymes in varying degrees. Advanced age (\u226558) and accompanying chronic diseases were considered as independent predictors for developing a severe and critically ill population with increased mortality. Laboratory results regarding the NEU percentage, NLR, ALC, and C-reactive protein levels were considered significant in predicting clinically critical disease or for prognosis assessment and thus require further studies. COVID-19 may affect multiple organs of the human body.",

The four deceased patients were senile elderly, aged 75, 82, 86, and 94 years. Each of these patients had suffered multiple underlying diseases and was bed-ridden for a long time with repeated hospitalisations. Three patients directly died of coronary heart disease with heart failure (one patient had acute myocardial infarction). A 65-year-old man died of COVID-19 pneumonia without underlying diseases but with a history of residing in Wuhan. The disease course on admission was 4 days without symptoms of dyspnoea. However, this patient experienced hyperpyrexia repeatedly during hospitalisation, with the disease progressing rapidly. Serious dyspnoea was observed on day 7 of admission (day 11 of the disease course). Therefore, the patient was immediately transferred to the ICU and provided with an intubated ventilator -assisted breathing therapy and received high-level antibiotics, gamma globulin, and hormone therapy. Subsequently, the patient developed septic shock, accompanied by multiple organ failure including renal failure, respiratory failure, and circulatory failure. Although actively rescued, with the patient receiving bedside hemofiltration, the patient eventually expired on day 14 of admission as the disease progressed rapidly ( Table 2) . COVID-19 or with the drugs administered. At present, it has been found that SARS-CoV-2 can be isolated from faeces, indicating that the virus can infect the digestive tract. Continuous repeated high fever often indicates the progression of the disease. Hence, a close monitoring of the patient's pulmonary imaging result is required, and healthcare staff should pay careful attention to respiratory failure. Most of the severe patients developed ARDS after 1 week of illness onset. Partial diseases progressed significantly rapidly, and the minimum time from illness onset to ARDS was 2 days. Moreover, multiple organ failure was immediately observed after illness onset. Therefore, disease conditions in special populations should be closely monitored and early intervened, and a 5-10-day disease course was considered critical.",

The elderly and individuals with chronic diseases are more likely to develop severe and critically ill pulmonary disease compared to young individuals or individuals with no chronic diseases. Moreover, severe and critically ill patients are at significantly higher risk of mortality than mild and moderate patients. One study involved 1590 COVID-19 patients in 31 provinces in China, with almost 40% of them were inpatients from Hubei Province. It was found that the combined chronic disease was associated with a worse prognosis. Any one of the combined chronic diseases was associated with a 79% higher risk of adverse outcomes while a 1.59-fold higher risk was with more than two chronic diseases [6] . In this study, five patients died. The analysis of laboratory results showed that NEU percentage, NLR, ALC, and C-reactive protein levels were significantly higher in severe and critically ill patients than those in mild and moderate patients, but the albumin level and ALC were significantly lower in severe and critically ill patients than those in mild and moderate patients. We observed that in critically ill patients, including death cases, during the disease course progression, ALC decreased progressively, while the NLR and C-reactive protein level increased progressively, suggesting that these indicators present an early warning effect on the progression of the disease. Although myocardial injury has not been supported by pathology, several clinical studies have reported the abnormality of myocardial enzymes in COVID-19 patients. Patients showed differing degrees of hepatic and renal impairment. Liver biopsy specimens showed moderate microvascular steatosis and mild active inflammation in the hepatic lobular tract. The level of blood urea nitrogen in the severe group was significantly higher than that in the mild and moderate group, but it may be affected by factors as age and nutritional status. and 14 of the disease course, respectively.

The lesions were more significantly absorbed after imaging than before imaging (E and F). and 16 of the disease course, respectively. The multiple patchy and ground-glass opacities and linear opacities were observed in both the lungs and mostly distributed along the subpleural area (A and B).

Partial les ions in the upper lobe of both lungs were more slightly absorbed after imaging than before imaging (C). The lesions in both lungs did not change J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f significantly (D). Therefore, patients received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment on the same day. During continuous EMCO treatment, diffuse patchy opacities were still observed in both lungs after re-examination and did not change significantly (E and F).",

Multiple organ failure may occur in the later stage of patients with COVID-19, which is difficult to treat for the critically ill patients. Although glucocorticoid is not a conventional treatment, hormone therapy has been proposed for severe and critically ill patients based on the several versions of the Diagnostic and Therapeutic Program of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia, which is also supported pathologically. It has been reported that glucocorticoid is considered effective in the treatment of patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19 [10].
