After induction of general anesthesia, the patient's right foot was inserted into an ankle distractor, and the ankle was accessed through standard anteromedial and anterolateral portals. Arthroscopy revealed abundant hypertrophied synovitis in the lateral aspect of the ankle joint. On debridement of the synovitis, an osteochondral defect measuring approximately 5 mm in diameter was noted on the anteromedial shoulder (Fig. 3\n). This was subsequently micro-fractured in standard fashion until active bleeding was noted from the subchondral bone of the lesion. On extensive examination using arthroscopy, it was also noted that the tibial articular surface showed no signs of fracture or penetration into the ankle joint. The portal incisions were then closed with 4-0 monofilament suture (Prolene\u2122, Johnson & Johnson Medical Ltd, Livingston, UK).",

A cortical window measuring approximately 3 cm in length and 2 cm in width was then carefully reflected using a sagittal saw (Fig. 5\n). Care was taken to bevel the cut so as to stabilize the cortical window. Once the cortical window was removed, a combination of rongeurs and curettes was used to remove all the necrotic bone. Once all the necrotic bone had been removed, which was noted to be quite spongy in consistency, an approximately 10-cm3 deficit was left to fill (Fig. 6\n). Specimens of the necrotic bone were sent for both culture and histopathologic examination for further evaluation.",

The advantage of this plate was that it can be easily cut and contoured to fit the size of the defect. The plate was secured with a combination of 2.7-mm unicortical and bicortical locking screws, with only 1 screw going directly through the cortical window (Fig. 8\n). Excellent stability was noted before the wound was closed. The wound was then copiously flushed and closed in standard fashion.

At 7 weeks, the patient began protective weightbearing in the removable cast boot and started physical therapy. At 9 weeks, the patient began to wean herself out of the removable cast boot into normal shoe gear. Radiographs and computed tomography scanning showed excellent consolidation of the defect with native bone incorporation (Fig. 9\n). The patient began light exercise activity at 11 weeks and returned to work. The cultures and pathology specimens confirmed the diagnosis of ON with no infection present (Fig. 10\n). The patient was subsequently discharged from care at 16 weeks postoperatively, with minimal swelling and no pain. She was instructed to continue with physical therapy to improve her ankle range of motion. The patient was interviewed by telephone at 24 months postoperatively and reported she was doing well with no pain in the right leg or ankle. Final radiographs were also taken at that time and showed excellent deficit incorporation with native bone visible (Fig. 11\n).",

Thus, osteoclasts and osteoblasts can undergo apoptosis after prolonged treatment with glucocorticoids. Weinstein et al (11) found that when mice were given prednisolone for 27 days, the metaphyseal apoptotic activity of both osteoblasts and osteoclasts was increased. This was associated with decreased bone turnover, density, and formation and decreased trabecular width and increased formation of cancellous bone.",

The receptor binding of Fas ligand leads to receptor changes and recruitments of certain proteins such as Fas-associated protein with death domain that can interact with caspase-8 and, in turn, leading to a caspase cascade and apoptosis (7). Glucocorticoids have also been shown to increase the lifespan and survival of osteoclasts by their receptor activation of nuclear factor\u2013\u03baB ligand, a member of the tumor necrosis factor ligand super-family (12). These findings provide further evidence that steroid-induced bone disease arises from intricate changes to a number of bone and immune cells, thus promoting bone loss.",

Subsequent studies have shown that hypertrophy of fat cells can contribute to this mechanism, resulting in an increase in intraosseous or intracortical pressure and, thus, compromising the endosteal arterial supply. In humans, the hyperlipidemia induced by corticosteroids causes increased deposition of fat within the intramedullary tissue (by steroid-induced differentiation of osteogenic marrow cells into adipocytes), thereby causing elevation of intracortical pressure, which can lead to restriction of blood flow, ischemia, and sinusoidal collapse. Given the inelastic, nonexpandable cortical shell of bone, increased intraosseous pressure can result in \u201ccompartment syndrome\u201d and subsequent disruption of blood flow. Compression of the sinusoidal system leads to venous stasis and eventually to arterial obstruction and subsequent bone injury.",

            "text": "Many different approaches are available for the treatment of ON; however, most of the published data have focused on the femoral head, with relatively little published regarding the treatment of ON in the lower leg. A meta-analysis of hip ON conducted by Mont et al (28) suggested that asymptomatic ON has a high prevalence of progression to symptomatic disease and subsequent femoral head collapse. The high morbidity rate associated with hip ON most often leads to the eventual need for total hip arthroplasty, despite conservative treatment. However, treatment is currently determined by the end-stage changes of the bone rather than on the pathogenesis and disease prevention (29). Conservative medical management is the first line of treatment and historically involves rest/activity modification, analgesics, and anti-inflammatory agents (30), all of which have provided relatively poor results. The largest numbers of published studies have investigated the use of bisphosphonates, which have been shown to be effective in numerous animal models. Their proposed mode of action is inhibition of osteoclast activity, which reduces edema and the rate of remodeling in the femoral head, which then increases bone mineral density and, hence, delays the progression of bone collapse (31). Iloprost, a vasoactive compound, acts on the terminal vascular bed by inducing vasodilation, reducing capillary permeability, and inhibiting platelet aggregation and has been shown to be effective in treating ON of the femur and the foot (29). Low-molecular-weight heparin products have also been used in patients with ON caused by thrombophilia or hypofibrinolysis (31).",

Chang et al (3) found that lovastatin stimulated osteogenesis and reversed the steroid suppressive effect in bone marrow stromal cells in non-ON cases but had only a mild effect in ON cases. Pritchett et al (8) retrospectively reviewed the data from 284 patients who had received high-dose steroids and were also taking statin therapy. They noted a 1% rate of ON, a significantly lower rate than the generally reported 3% to 20% rate of ON for patients receiving high-dose steroids. However, no studies to date have been reported on the use of statins in patients with established/pre-existing ON.

The reported operative treatments for atraumatic ON of the ankle have included core decompression, vascularized and nonvascularized bone grafting, tibiotalar fusion, and talectomy with tibiocalcaneal fusion 37, 38. Core decompression has historically been used during the early stages of ON of the ankle as a treatment method to decrease pain and defer the eventual collapse of the joint (38). The multiple locations of the lesions, including the distal tibia and fibula, talar dome, and calcaneus, and the relatively small affected bones (compared with the femoral head and distal femur), make this procedure technically difficult, especially considering that large-diameter trocars were initially the instruments used. Marulanda et al (38) investigated the treatment of ankle ON with a new technique using multiple small percutaneous 3-mm perforations in a total of 44 ankles. At a mean follow-up duration of 45 months, 40 ankles (91%) had achieved a successful clinical outcome and a statistically significant improvement of the mean American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle and hindfoot scale score, which increased from 42 points preoperatively to 88 points postoperatively (38). No perioperative complications developed, although 3 ankles subsequently collapsed and required arthrodesis. However, ankle arthrodesis was avoided in 93% of the cases at a mean follow-up period of 3.6 years.",
