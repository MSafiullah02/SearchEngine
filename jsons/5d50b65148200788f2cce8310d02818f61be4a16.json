Specifically, it is our strong belief that the most major clinical and public health challenges will be long term. They will inevitably result from the development of an effective vaccine for COVID-19, which may or may not occur during the next 12 to 18 months. If an effective and safe vaccine becomes available this intervention will be lifesaving. As has been the case before, the introduction of this lifesaving innovation is likely to further increase racial inequalities that already adversely affect Blacks and other disadvantaged minorities.",

            "text": "For example, the advent of lifesaving highly active antiretroviral therapy for human immunodeficiency syndrome was accompanied by increases in racial inequalities. Specifically, Black: White mortality rate ratios among men increased from 3.2 to 6.6 (25-34 years), to 3.7 to 6.2 (35-44), 3.9 to 8.6 (45-54), 4.5 to 9.5 In addition, for respiratory distress syndrome, there was a nationwide reversal from a survival advantage to a survival disadvantage for Blacks following the introduction of surfactant. (7) Most recently, similar increases in racial inequalities in mortality from hepatocellular cancer occurred followed the licensure of lifesaving, but prohibitively expensive for some, drugs for hepatitis C virus which is a major risk factor. (8) Perhaps of greatest direct relevance to COVID-19 were the experiences before and after the development of the Salk vaccine for poliomyelitis (9) . In 1952, before the introduction of the vaccine, Blacks experienced significantly lower rates of paralytic polio than Whites. These observations were hypothesized to be related to herd immunity among Black children resulting from immunity acquired from infections which did not lead to paralysis in infancy and early childhood. Specifically, the incidence rates in Des Moines, Iowa and Kansas City, Missouri were 3-fold greater in Whites than among Blacks. By 1959, after the widespread dissemination of the Salk vaccine, the incidence rate in Blacks rose to 21-fold greater among Whites in Des Moines and 33 fold greater in Kansas City. (9) With respect to COVID-19, it may well be too late during the current pandemic to address the multiple factors, which already impose greater morbidity 7 and mortality burdens on Blacks and other socio-economically disadvantaged groups. It is certainly important to conduct the high-quality research necessary to understand the factors responsible for observed increases in racial inequalities, which have been temporally related to the introduction of several lifesaving innovations. It would also be of importance to identify communities which appear to have been more successful in achieving more equitable distributions of these lifesaving innovations among Blacks and other disadvantaged minorities. To do so, however, will require leadership from clinical and public health officials whose visions should build upon and extend beyond the provision of resources for treating those who are ill today, beyond the identification and testing of promising but unproven diagnostic and therapeutic options, and, perhaps most importantly, far beyond the development of an effective vaccine.",

            "text": ", the United States population of about 332 million represents about 4.25% of the population of the world which is approximately 7.6 billion (1) With respect to coronavirus (COVID-19), however, even without the effects of the most recent widespread testing, the United States already has risen to #1 in the world in both numbers of cases and deaths. Further, the number of cases in the United States of approximately 600,000 represents about 30% of the approximately 2,000,000 cases worldwide. Finally, the number of deaths in the United States of approximately 25,000 represents over 20% of the approximately 110,000 deaths globally. (2) In the context of these ominous forebodings are emerging clinical and public health challenges in COVID-19 of recurring racial inequalities in mortality. Specifically, as of April 14, 2020, in the United States, 32% of the deaths from COVID-19 are among Black residents despite the fact that Blacks comprise only 13% of the population. (3) These descriptive data indicate a 2.3fold excess risk of mortality from COVID-19 in the United States among Blacks compared to Whites. Quantitatively, it is plausible that this large magnitude of increase of COVID-19 is an overestimate. Qualitatively, however, based on the existing totality of evidence, (5-11) the observation is very real and poses major clinical and public health challenges. For example, for many decades, markedly reduced life expectancies of Blacks compared with Whites have been noted despite 4 advances in preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic options. In addition, multiple factors have been identified and postulated to explain the observed persistent mortality disadvantages of Blacks compared with Whites",

The study commenced in 1932, but the 8 results were disseminated in 1972, approximately 30 years after the widespread utilization of penicillin as an effective and safe treatment for syphilis. As direct consequences of the unnecessarily late disclosure of the results, there were decreases in both outpatient and inpatient visits as well as subsequent increases in mortality. For Black men, life expectancy at age 45 fell by up to 1.5 years, which is approximately 35% of the longstanding gap in life expectancy between Black and",
