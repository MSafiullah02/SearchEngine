This information should be conveyed clearly and repeatedly via television, WeChat, Facebook, Twitter and the Internet. Psychological problems, including anxiety and depression, are common among patients on PD.5 Thus, any myths or false information about the COVID-19 pandemic may deteriorate their psychological state. It is reported that fear can be more harmful than SARS-CoV-2 in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.6 First, it is important to educate patients about the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. Currently, the natural host of SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear. Respiratory droplet transmission is the major route of SARS-CoV-2 spread, and it can be transmitted via direct contact with secretions and aerial droplets or via the fecal-oral route. Once SARS-CoV-2 invades the human body, it mainly affects the respiratory tract; however, the digestive tract, kidneys, and/or nervous system may also be involved. SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat and can be inactivated under conditions of a temperature of 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes or by using 75% alcohol, a chlorine-containing disinfectant, and chloroform.",

The clinical symptoms are diverse and range from asymptomatic to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan dysfunction. Typical symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, headache, fatigue, myalgia, and breathlessness. Moreover, symptoms related to the digestive systems (e.g., nausea and diarrhea) and ophthalmic symptoms must not be ignored. Imaging manifestations vary with various factors such as the patient\u2019 age, immunity status, and disease stage at the time of imaging. The specific diagnosis for confirmed cases is a positive molecular test of respiratory samples. To date, there is no vaccine or effective antiviral medicine. Treatment is essentially supportive and based on symptoms. Individuals of all ages are susceptible. COVID-19 is a particular risk for older persons, particularly those with multimorbidity.[\n7\n] In China, the overall case-fatality rate was 2.3%, and it was elevated among individuals with preexisting comorbid conditions.[\n8\n]\n",

Instructions should include points on how to wear facemasks, how to use tissues to cover the nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing, how to dispose tissues and contaminated items in waste receptacles, how and when to use hand hygiene, and how to practice social distancing. Hand hygiene (i.e., hand washing or use of an alcohol-based hand rub) is performed especially after people have been in a public place or after blowing the nose, coughing, sneezing, or being in contact with secretions of people who might be infected. PD patients and caregivers are familiar with aseptic techniques as they are performed during and after PD procedures. However, following appropriate hand hygiene procedures should be emphasized on during this specific period. As the virus can remain viable and infectious in aerosols for hours and on surfaces for up to days, it is indicated that aerosol and fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is plausible.[\n9\n] Patients should be required to remain under home quarantine. The ventilation at home should be appropriate, with ample sunlight to allow for the destruction of the virus. Regular decontamination of rooms, surfaces, and equipment must be performed, and ultraviolet radiation must be preferably used. Social distancing measures dictate that patients should stay 6 feet away from each other. In addition, patients should be reminded to avoid crowded areas and postpone non-essential travel to places with ongoing transmission.",

Instead of patients themselves, relatives or caregivers are encouraged to visit outpatient departments to obtain new prescriptions for drugs, PD fluid, and iodophor caps. In addition, these individuals are encouraged to minimize the time they spend at outpatient departments. An individual must be separated by a distance of at least 6 feet from the nearest person (in all directions). In accordance with the local health care policy, physicians may increase the amount of single dispensing appropriately. Medicine and essential items for PD should be stored in sufficient reserves. The regular clinic follow-up should be postponed. For patients with unstable conditions and those who are bedridden or living in remote areas, it is recommended to visit the nearest hospitals. The patients could also be monitored or interviewed via WeChat or over the phone if necessary. Automated PD (APD) is preferred if patients\u2019 economic condition permit. Remote monitoring in APD enables clinicians to access more accurate clinical data real time, thereby aiding in the earlier identification of clinical problems and the ability to adjust treatment approaches. 10 In addition, patients at home could still receive continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) if flowsheets can be faxed (or hand delivered every several day by caregivers) to the dialysis facility for review.",

The patients\u2019 temperature should be monitored by the medical staff. At the nephrology triage station, a nephrologist and PD nurse must further evaluate patients. Triage to the fever clinic is necessary when patients experience respiratory symptoms or are suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, if the fever is found to be associated with PD, the nephrologist must be consulted further. If COVID-19 is excluded, the patient may return to the nephrology clinic or may be transferred to a ward if hospitalization is needed.

Surfaces must be regularly decontaminated. In cases where PD centers have APD machines, the treatment of patients undergoing CAPD should be modified such that they may be treated on APD machines during hospitalization. This will reduce the number of connection times of the catheters and transfer sets and further avoid the possibility of contact infection. Assessments should be conducted to exclude the presence of suspected or probable COVID-19 among patients and caregivers. Suspected patients should be referred to government-designated centers for isolation and testing. Any surface, supplies, or equipment located in wards housing suspected patients should be disinfected or discarded.
