Marshall Hand hygiene has never been shown to control pneumonia or reduce mortality in ventilated patients in a randomized trial. The efficacy of hand hygiene in reducing the incidence of infection has been studied in six non-randomized and two randomized trials [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] (Table 2 ). In only four of these studies was RCT, randomized controlled trial pneumonia the endpoint and in none did hand washing have any impact. The only study that demonstrated an impact on mortality of hand hygiene was the cohort study of Semmelweis in 1861 [10] . This classic study showed the survival benefit of hand disinfection. In women admitted for delivery, the mortality from child bed fever was significantly reduced from 11.40% to 3.04 % following the implementation of hand washing with chlorinated lime, compared with an historical control group of doctors who did not wash their hands. This study is often referred to as the prime evidence for the effectiveness of hand disinfection.

Based upon this concept, ventilating patients in a semi-recumbent position is thought to have a beneficial effect on reducing the incidence of reflux and aspiration from the stomach, whereby pneumonia in ventilated patients could be prevented. This maneuvre has been investigated in two RCTs [16, 17] (Table 3 ). The first study shows that ventilating patients in a semirecumbent position leads to a significant reduction in pneumonia.
