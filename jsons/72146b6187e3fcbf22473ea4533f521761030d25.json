The model divided a community in subpopulations comprised by young and elder persons, in order to take into account higher risk of fatality among elder persons with severe CoViD-19. From data collected in the S\u00e3o Paulo State, we estimated the transmission and additional mortality rates, from which we calculated the basic reproduction number R 0 . From estimated parameters, estimation of the deaths due to CiViD-19 was three times lower than those found in literature. Considering isolation as a control mechanism, we varied isolation rates of young and elder persons in order to assess their epidemiological impacts. The epidemiological scenarios focused mainly on evaluating the number of severe CoViD-19 cases and deaths due to this disease when isolation is introduced in a population.",

World Health Organization (WHO) declared CoViD-19 pandemic on 11 March, based on its own definition: \"A pandemic is the worldwide spread of a new disease.

This virus enters in susceptible persons through nose, mouth or eyes, and infects cells in the respiratory tract, being capable of releasing millions of new virus. In serious cases, immune cells overreact and attack lung cell causing acute respiratory disease syndrome and possibly death. In general, the fatality rate in elder patients (60 years or more) is much higher than the average, and under 40 years seems to be around 0.2%. Currently, there is not vaccine, neither efficient treatment, even many drugs (cloroquine, for instance) are under clinical trial.

In mathematical model, there is a fundamental threshold (see [1] ) called the basic reproduction number, which is defined as the secondary cases produced by one case introduced in a completely susceptible population, and is denoted by R 0 . When a control mechanisms is introduced, this number is reduced, and is called as the reduced reproduction number R r . Ferguson et al. [4] proposed a model in order to investigate the effects of isolation of susceptible persons. They analyzed two scenarios called by them as mitigation and suppression. Roughly, mitigation reduces the basic reproduction number R 0 , but not lower than one (1 < R r < R 0 ), while suppression reduces the basic reproduction number lower than one (R r < 1). They predicted the numbers of severe cases and deaths due to CoViD-19 without control measure, and compared them with those numbers when isolations (mitigation and suppression) are introduced as control measures. Li et al. discussed the role of undocumented infections [5] .",

When the estimation is based on few number of data, that is, in the beginning of epidemics, some cautions must be taken, because the rates maybe over or under estimated. The reason is that in the very beginning phase of epidemics, the spreading out of infection and deaths increase exponentially without bound. Currently, there is not sufficient number of kits to detect infection by new coronavirus. For this reason, tests to confirm infection by this virus is done only in hospitalized persons, and, also, in persons who died manifesting symptoms of CoViD-19. Hence, we have only data of hospitalized persons (D 2y and D 2o ) and those who died (\u03a0 y and \u03a0 o ). Taking into account hospitalized persons with CoViD-19, we estimate the transmission rates, and from persons died due to CoViD-19, we estimate the additional mortality rates.

Figure 5 shows the estimated curves of the number of hospitalized (severe) CoViD-19 (D 2y , D 2o and D 2 = D 2y + D 2o ). We observe that the peaks of severe CoViD-19 are for elder, young and all persons are, respectively, 2.061 \u00d7 10 5 , 5.532 \u00d7 10 5 and 7.582 \u00d7 10 5 , which occur at same time t = 72 days. Figure 6 shows the estimated curves of accumulated number of severe CoViD-19 (\u2126 y , \u2126 o and \u2126 = \u2126 y + \u2126 o ), from equation (7). At t = 140 days, \u2126 is approaching to asymptote (or plateau), which can be understood as the time when the first wave of epidemics ends. The curves \u2126 y , \u2126 o and \u2126 attain values at t = 140, respectively, 1.798 \u00d7 10 6 , 0.563 \u00d7 10 6 and 2.361 \u00d7 10 6 . (8). At t = 140 days, \u03a0 is approaching to plateau. The values of \u03a0 y , \u03a0 o and \u03a0 are at t = 140, for the first method of estimation, respectively, 0.6235 \u00d7 10 5 (3.47%), 1.883\u00d710 5 (33.4%) and 2.507\u00d710 5 (10.62%), and for the second method of estimation, respectively, 1.60 \u00d7 10 4 (0.89%), 6.265 \u00d7 10 4 (11, 13%) and 7.865 \u00d7 10 4 (3.33%). Percentage between parentheses is the ratio \u03a0/\u2126. The second estimation method is shown in Figure 7 . By comparing percentages between deaths due to CoViD-19 (\u03a0) and accumulated severe CoViD-19 cases (\u2126), the first method predicts at least 3-times that predicted by the second method. Especially among elder persons, second method predicts 11.13%, three times lower than 33.4% predicted by the first method. Hence, the second estimation is more credible than the first one. Hence, we will adopt the second estimation method for additional mortality rates, \u03b1 y = 0.0009 and \u03b1 o = 0.009 (days \u22121 ) hereafter except explicitly cited. Remember that additional mortality rates are considered constant in all time. Figure 8 shows the curves of the number of susceptible persons (S y , S o and S = S y + S o ). At t = 0, the numbers of S y , S o and S are, respectively, 3.77762 \u00d7 10 7 , 0.68238 \u00d7 10 7 and 4.46 \u00d7 10 7 , and diminish due to infection, to lower values at t = 140 days. Notice that, after the first wave of epidemics, very few number of susceptible persons are left behind, which are 1.23880 \u00d7 10 5 (0.33%), 0.02643 \u00d7 10 5 (0.039%) and 1.26523 \u00d7 10 5 (0.28%), for young, elder and total persons, respectively. Percentage between parentheses is the ratio S(140)/S(0). Figure 9 shows the curves of the number of immune persons (I y , I o and I = I y +I o ). At t = 0, the number of immune persons I y , I o and I increase from zero to, respectively, 3.76156 \u00d7 10 7 (99.57%), 0.67234 \u00d7 10 7 (98.53%) and 4.43390 \u00d7 10 7 (99.41%) at t = 140 days. Percentage between parentheses is the ratio I/S(0).",

Further, there is discriminated (preferential) isolation of elder persons, hence we assume that \u03b7 2o = \u03b7 2y .",

Recalling that \u03b7 2y and \u03b7 2o are per-capita rates, both rates isolate proportionally young and elder persons, but the actual number of isolation is higher among young persons. We choose 7 different values for the isolation rate \u03b7 2 (days \u22121 ) applied to young and elder persons. The values for \u03b7 2 : 0.00021 (R r = 1), 0.001 (R r = 0.23), 0.005 (R r = 0.048), 0.01 (R r = 0.024), 0.015 (R r = 0.016), 0.025 (R r = 0.009) and 0.035 (R r = 0.007). The value for the reduced reproduction number is R r is calculated from equation (10) . For \u03b7 2 = 0.035, the reduced reproduction number with respect to the basic reproduction number is reduced in 0.1%. In all figures, the case \u03b7 2 = 0 (R 0 = 6.915) is also shown. Figure 10 shows curves of severe cases of CoViD-19 D 2j , j = y, o, without and with isolation for different values of \u03b7 2 . Notice that first two curves obtained with \u03b7 2 = 0 and 0.00021 practically coincide, and the latter is slightly lower than the roughly estimated \u03b7 th = 2.19\u00d710 \u22124 years \u22121 . We present values of peak for three values of \u03b7 2 . For \u03b7 2 = 0, the peak of young (first coordinate) and elder (second coordinate) persons are (5.532\u00d710 5 ,2.061\u00d710 5 ), and for \u03b7 2 = 0.01 (3.566 \u00d7 10 5 ,1.361 \u00d7 10 5 ), and 0.035 (0.699 \u00d7 10 5 ,0.292 \u00d7 10 5 . The time (days) at which the peak occurs for young (first coordinate) and elder (second coordinate) persons are for \u03b7 2 = 0 (72,71), 0.01 (75,74) and 0.035 (77,77). For \u03b7 2 = 0.01 in comparison with \u03b7 2 = 0, the peaks are reduced in 64.4% and 66.0%, respectively, for young and elder persons. For \u03b7 2 = 0.035, the peaks are reduced in 12.6% and 14.2%. As isolation parameter \u03b7 2 increases, the diminishing peaks of curves of D 2y and D 2o displace initially to right (higher times), but at \u03b7 2 = \u03b7 c 2 , they change the direction and move leftwardly. However, all curves remain inside the curve without isolation (\u03b7 2 = 0). The values at which the peaks change direction are \u03b7 c 2y = 0.0027 days \u22121 (t = 78.35) and \u03b7 c 2o = 0.0028 days \u22121 (t = 77.58). In order to understand this phenomenon, we recall an age-structured model to describe rubella infection [11] [12] . There, as vaccination rate increases, the peaks of age-depending forces of infection initially moves to right, and, then, move leftwardly. As a consequence, the average age at the first infection increases.",

For this reason, in the system of equations (2), (3) and (4), we let \u03b7 2 = 0 for t < 27, and \u03b7 2 > 0 for t \u2265 27. In Figure 11 we show the estimated curves of severe CoViD-19 cases D 2 without (\u03b7 2 = 0 in all time) and with (\u03b7 2 = 0.035 days \u22121 ) isolation, which was introduced at t = 27. It seems that the effects of isolation (in observed data) appears at around t = 38 (April 5), 11 days after its introduction. Figure  11 shows an isolation scheme described by \u03b7 2 = 0.035 days \u22121 introduced at t = 27, which decreases the curve without isolation. The transition from without to with isolation is under very complex dynamics, for this reason we can not assure that \u03b7 2 = 0.035 days \u22121 is a good estimation (there are so few data). Hence, one of the curves in Figure 10 may correspond to the isolation applied in the S\u00e3o Paulo State. The curve corresponding to \u03b7 2 = 0.00021 days \u22121 in Figure 10 can be considered as a failure isolation (R r > 1), for this reason this curve is removed in all following figures.

Firstly, we choose the isolation rate of elder persons \u03b7 2o = 0.01 days \u22121 , and vary \u03b7 2y = 0.001 (R r = 0.235), 0.005 (R r = 0.049), 0.01 (R r = 0.024), 0.015 (R r = 0.016), 0.025 (R r = 0.009), 0.035 (R r = 0.007) and 0.1 (R r = 0.002).

The decreasing pattern of D 2y follows that observed in regime 1, but in D 2o , as \u03b7 2y increases, the peaks displace faster to right, and the curves become more asymmetric (increased skewness) and spread beyond the curve without isolation. Figure 18 shows curves of the number of susceptible persons S j , j = y, o, varying \u03b7 2y , fixing \u03b7 2o = 0.01 days \u22121 . The decreasing pattern of S y follows that observed in regime 1 (sigmoid shape substituted by exponential decay), but the sigmoid shaped decreasing curves of S o , as \u03b7 2y increases, move from bottom to top, which is an opposite pattern observed in regime 1. As isolation of young increases, the number of susceptible young persons decreases, but the number of susceptible elder persons increases. However, from Figure 17 , severe CoViD-19 cases decrease for both subpopulations. This can be explained by the decreasing in immune persons: young immune persons decrease 41-times when \u03b7 2y decreases from 0.015 to 0.1, while elder persons decrease 4-times (see Table 3 ).",

As consequence, maybe severe CoViD019 cases should be much lower (consequently, deaths also). If currently adopted lockdown is indeed based on the goal of decreasing hospitalized CoViD-19 cases, then our model agrees, since it predicts that higher number of young and elder persons must be isolated in order to achieve this objective. However, if the goal is reduction in the number of deaths due to CoViD-19, as much elder persons must be isolated, but not so much young persons. Remember that in a mixing of young and elder persons, the infection is much harmfull in elder than young persons, which is reason to avoid contact between them. An optimal rates of isolation of young and elder persons to reduce both CoViD-19 cases and deaths can be obtained by optimal control theory [8] .",

For tuberculosis model considering drug-sensitive and resistant strains, there is not f (\u03ba), but s * is solution of a second degree polynomial [19] .

When a mechanism of protection of susceptible persons is introduced in a population, the basic reproduction number R 0 is reduced to R r , the reduced reproduction number. The protection of susceptible persons is done or by vaccine (not yet available), or isolation (or quarantine).
