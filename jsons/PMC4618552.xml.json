Uncomplicated pregnancies lead to physiologic changes resulting in altered pulmonary and immunologic function [8, 9], including a 20% increase in maternal oxygen consumption, a 10%\u201325% decrease in functional residual capacity, and significantly increased forced vital capacity after 14\u201316 weeks gestation. Severe respiratory illness during pregnancy may further disrupt maternal tolerance to hypoxemia and reduce oxygen flow to the fetus. Of 12 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV in South China during 1 January\u201331 July 2003, spontaneous miscarriages were reported from over half (59%) of those infected during their first trimesters [10].

All interviewers demonstrated an understanding of cultural sensitivities and spoke Arabic. A limitation of our report is that confirmation from seroepidemiologic evidence is difficult with any retrospective investigation, and associations between serologic evidence and a particular outcome can appear spurious. Indeed, the fetal loss rate from nonchromosomal and nonstructural causes at 20 weeks gestation is estimated to be 0.5% (95% confidence interval, .3%\u2013.8%) [13] in developed countries, and other biological explanations for our observations are possible. Nonetheless, no other MERS-CoV infections were confirmed in Jordan around this brief outbreak period despite hundreds of specimens being tested via active surveillance [14]. On the basis of the exclusivity of the timing of the pregnant subject's unprotected MERS-CoV exposure history, concurrent respiratory illness and stillbirth, and positive results of subsequent MERS-CoV serologic tests, we describe a possible association between MERS-CoV infection and stillbirth.",
