            "text": "PRRSV is a small, single-stranded positive sense, enveloped, RNA virus that is a member of the family Arteriviridae in the order Nidovirales (Cavanagh, 1997). The genome of PRRSV is about 15 kb in size and contains 10 open reading frames (ORF), designated as ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF2a, ORF2b, ORF3, ORF4, ORF5, ORF5a, ORF6 and ORF7 (Firth et al., 2011, Johnson et al., 2011). PRRSV can be divided into two main genotypes: type 1 (European type) and type 2 (North American type) (Shi et al., 2010). Similar to many other RNA viruses, PRRSV is characterized by a high mutation rate and the potential for the emergence of new genetically diverse strains (Pirzadeh et al., 1998, Rowland et al., 1999, Forsberg et al., 2001, Hanada et al., 2005). There is evidence that PRRSV isolates with varying degrees of virulence continue to emerge worldwide (Nelsen et al., 1999, Han et al., 2006, Fang et al., 2007) and this is possibly due to a high degree of viral recombination and/or mutation (Yuan et al., 1999, Yuan et al., 2000, Yuan et al., 2001, Yuan et al., 2004). Quasispecies evolution of PRRSV has been demonstrated during sequential passages in pigs (Chang et al., 2002). Specifically, three independent groups of pigs were infected with type 2 PRRSV strain VR-2332 and the PRRSV infection was maintained for 367 days by pig-to-pig passage of infectious material at 60-day-intervals. The authors found ORF1b and ORF7 to be highly conserved whereas 48 nucleotide mutations were identified within ORF5 (Chang et al., 2002).",

In most cases, PCV2b strains were identified in severe outbreaks (Cheung et al., 2007); however, current experimental evidence does not support major differences in virulence or pathogenicity between PCV2a and PCV2b (Fort et al., 2008, Opriessnig et al., 2008). PCV2 has been shown to impair both the onset of protective immunity (Segal\u00e9s et al., 2001, Darwich et al., 2002) and induction of proinflammatory cytokines (Darwich et al., 2003, Vincent et al., 2005) which may indirectly enhance the cellular uptake, replication and survivability of concurrent PRRSV infection. Previous studies demonstrated that concurrent infection of PRRSV and PCV2a or PCV2b prolongs PCV2 viremia and shedding when compared to pigs infected with PCV2 alone (Rovira et al., 2002, Opriessnig et al., 2008, Sinha et al., 2011). Similarly, pigs co-infected with PRRSV and PCV2a or PCV2b had more severe macroscopic and microscopic lung lesions and a stronger anti-PRRSV IgG response compared to pigs infected with PRRSV alone (Opriessnig et al., 2012). Taken together, these studies emphasize the importance of co-infection of both pathogens in disease expression and pathogenesis of PRRS and PCVAD.",

It is thought that PRRSV in a pig or population of pigs exists as quasispecies variants which help the virus persist in the host and survive the host immune response (Rowland et al., 1999). This makes the interpretation of observed mutations somewhat difficult since one cannot be sure whether a specific mutation was already present in the inoculum or if it occurred during the passage in pigs. To account for this concern, in the current study, a uniform PRRSV population was used for the first passage by using PRRSV derived from an infectious clone as described previously (Ni et al., 2011). However, two pigs were used in each passage and tissues from the pigs were pooled at termination and used for the infecting the next set of pigs. This strategy was done to increases the changes of successful PRRSV transmission from one passage to the next. This could have impacted the results as PRRSV could have evolved differently in each pig which would have been masked by using a tissue pool for reinfection.",

According to the data from this study, no specific genetic marker in the ORF5, ORF6, ORF7 and partial Nsp2 genes of PRRSV was identified during the serial passages in pigs; however, it is interesting to note the high frequency of amino acid mutations of PRRSV genes in PCV2 co-infection groups relative to PRRSV infection alone.

            "text": "The present study further confirms that PRRSV evolves continuously in pigs infected with PRRSV alone or concurrently with PCV2a and PCV2b and that different genes of the viral genome undergo various degrees of mutations. Ultimately, this could mean that by controlling PCV2 infection in a herd, a producer can decrease the risks of PRRSV mutations, and thus subsequent PRRS outbreaks associated with novel PRRSV variants. In the past, dual infections with PRRSV and porcine respiratory coronavirus, or PRRSV and swine influenza virus were studied using conventional pigs (Van et al., 1996) or gnotobiotic pigs (Van et al., 1999) and in general, disease was found to be more pronounced in dually inoculated pigs. Interestingly, in gnotobiotic pigs the result of the co-infection was additive rather than synergistic (Van et al., 1999). In another study, co-infection of specific-pathogen-free pigs with PRRSV and Pseudorabies virus resulted in more severe clinical signs and increased pneumonia in pigs inoculated with both viruses compared to pigs infected with either virus alone (Shibata et al., 2000). The mixed infection of PRRSV and PCV2 is one of the most common co-infections associated with swine disease under field conditions today. It is also well recognized that PCV2 replication is enhanced by concurrent PRRSV infection in both colostrum-deprived (Allan et al., 2000a, Harms et al., 2001) and conventional pigs (Opriessnig et al., 2012) compared to singularly infected pig. There is also evidence suggesting that the commonality of porcine immune function target cells may play a key role in this synergism for these viruses due to stimulation of the monocyte/macrophage lineage and other cells of the immune system (Allan et al., 2000b, Rovira et al., 2002).",

The genomic variability may be attributed to the lack of proof reading function of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Concurrence of variable regions with the hydrophilic domains of GP5 can be the result of host's selective humoral immune response directed against the exposed ectodomains of this envelope glycoprotein which in turn favors antigenic drifts. The genomic variations contribute to the emergence of antigenic variants, which is an effective mechanism for evading the host's immune surveillance. Clinical manifestations of PRRS are diverse and complex and they depend in part on the immune status of the host. Whether mutations within the antigenic domains of the GP5 may contribute to the establishment of a chronic form of the disease and eventually a persistent infection remains to be demonstrated (Pirzadeh et al., 1998).",
