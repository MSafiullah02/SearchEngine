In this approach, all interactions among all components in a system are described mathematically and computed models are established. These in silico models encode and test hypotheses about mechanisms underlying the function of cells, the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of disease, and contribute to identification of new drug targets and drug design. The development of in silico models is facilitated by rapidly advancing experimental and analytical tools that generate information-rich, high-throughput biological data. Bioinformatics provides tools for pattern recognition, machine learning, statistical modeling, and data extraction from databases that contribute to in silico modeling. Dynamical systems theory is the natural language for investigating complex biological systems that demonstrate nonlinear spatio-temporal behavior. Most in silico models aim to complement (and not replace) experimental research. Experimental data are needed for parameterization, calibration, and validation of in silico models. Typical examples in biology are models for molecular networks, where the behavior of cells is expressed in terms of quantitative changes in the levels of transcripts and gene products, as well as models of cell cycle. In medicine, in silico models of cancer, immunological disease, lung disease, and infectious diseases complement conventional research with in vitro models, animal models, and clinical trials. This chapter presents basic concepts of bioinformatics, systems biology, their applications in in silico modeling, and also reviews applications in biology and disease.",

Sieburg (1990) and (Danchin et al. 1991) were two of the earliest published works that used this term. Specifically, in silico models gained much interest in the early stages by various imaging studies (Chakroborty et al., 2003). As an example, microarray analysis that enabled measurement of genome-scale expression levels of genes provided a method to investigate regulatory networks. Years of regulatory network studies (that included microarray-based investigations) led to the development of some well-characterized regulatory networks such as E. coli and yeast regulatory networks. These networks are available in the GeneNetWeaver (GNW) tool. GNW is an open-source tool for in silico benchmark generation and performance profiling of network inference methods. Thus, the advent of high-throughput experimental tools has allowed for the simultaneous measurement of thousands of biomolecules, opening the way for in silico model construction of increasingly large and diverse biological systems.

On the other hand, models may be biologically realistic but mathematically intractable. This problem usually arises because biologists unfamiliar with the limitations of mathematical analysis want to include every known biological effect in the model. Even if it were possible to produce such models, they would be of little use since their behavior would be as complex to investigate as the experimental situation. These problems can be avoided by formulating clear explicit biological goals before attempting to construct a model. This will ensure that the resulting model is biologically sound, can be experimentally verified, and will generate biological insight or new biological hypotheses. The aim of a model should not simply be to reproduce biological data. Indeed, often the most useful models are those that exhibit discrepancies from experiment. Such deviations will typically stimulate new experiments or hypotheses.

For example, ideally, for in silico modeling of a molecular network, knowledge of the network structure, all reaction rates, concentrations, and spatial distributions of molecules at any time point is needed. Unfortunately, such information is unavailable even for the best-studied systems. In silico simulations thus always have to use a level of mathematical abstraction, which is dictated by the extent of our biological knowledge, by molecular details of the network, and by the specific questions that are addressed. Understanding the complexity of the disease and its biological significance in health can be achieved by integrating data from the different functional genomics experiments with medical, physiological, and environmental factor information, and computing mathematically. The advantage of mathematical modeling of disease lies in the fact that such models not only shed light on how a complex process works, which could be very difficult for inferring an understanding of each component of this process, but also predict what may follow as time evolves or as the characteristics of particular system components are modified.

            "text": "Trauma and infection can cause acute inflammatory responses, the degree of which may have several pathological manifestations like systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, and multiple organ failure (MOF). However, an appropriate management of these states requires further investigation. Translating the results of basic science research to effective therapeutic regimes has been a longstanding issue due in part to the failure to account for the complex nonlinear nature of the inflammatory process wherein SIRS/MOF represent a disordered state. Hence, the in silico modeling approach can be a promising research direction in this area. Indeed, in silico modeling of inflammation has been applied in an effort to bridge the gap between basic science and clinical trials. Specifically, both agent-based modeling and equation-based modeling have been utilized (Vodovotz et al., 2008). Equation-based modeling encompasses primarily ordinary differential equations (ODE) and partial differential equations (PDE). Initial modeling studies were focused on the pathophysiology of the acute inflammatory response to stress, and these studies suggested common underlying processes generated in response to infection, injury, and shock. Later, mathematical models included the recovery phase of injury and gave insight into the link between the initial inflammatory response and subsequent healing process. The first mathematical models of wound healing dates back to the 1980s and early 1990s. These models and others developed in the 1990s investigated epidermal healing, repair of the dermal extracellular matrix, wound contraction, and wound angiogenesis. Most of these models were deterministic and formulated using differential equations. In addition, recent models have been formulated using differential equations to analyze different strategies for improved healing, including wound VACs, commercially engineered skin substitutes, and hyperbaric oxygen. In addition, agent-based models have been used in wound healing research. For example, Mi et al. (2007) developed an agent-based model to analyze different treatment strategies with wound debridement and topical administration of growth factors. Their model produced the expected results of healing when analyzing for different treatment strategies including debridement, release of PDGF, reduction in tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and increase of TGF-\u03b21. The investigators suggested that a drug company should use a mathematical model to test a new drug before going through the expensive process of basic science testing, toxicology and clinical trials. Indeed, clinical trial design can be improved by prior in silico modeling. For example, in silico modeling has led to the knowledge that patients who suffered from the immune-suppressed phenotype of late-stage multiple organ failure, and were susceptible to usually trivial nosocomial infections, demonstrated sustained elevated markers of tissue damage and inflammation through two weeks of simulated time. However, anti-cytokine drug trials with treatment protocols of only one dose or one day had not incorporated this knowledge into their design, with subsequent failure of candidate treatments.",
