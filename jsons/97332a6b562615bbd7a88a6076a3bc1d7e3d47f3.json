On March 11, 2020 , the WHO declared the outbreak of a pandemic, which possibly will infect more than 50% of the global community. 1 The disease caused by SARS-CoV2, named COVID-19, is of hugely variable intensity, from the asymptomatic to septic patients. The clinical presentation in the majority of the cases is not only with fever (87-98%), cough (55-80%), dyspnea (30-50%), sputum production (30%), chest oppression (20%), myalgia (30-45%), diarrhea (3-14%) and headache (15%), but also with anosmia and hyposmia. [2] [3] [4] Severe outcomes, including intensive care necessity, mechanical ventilation and death, have been strongly associated with the elderly and the presence of comorbidities, such as diabetes and chronic cardiac, renal or pulmonary diseases.",

Few reports have addressed the cancer population. The first, from the China outbreak, reported the clinical presentations and outcomes of 18 patients with cancer, compared to those without the disease. Patients with cancer were observed to have a higher risk of severe events, compared to patients without cancer. Moreover, cancer patients who underwent recent chemotherapy or surgery had a higher risk of clinically severe events than those who did not receive treatment in this series. Only one patient in the group had a hematological malignancy (a 47-year-old male with a diagnosis of lymphoma) and the resolution of COVID-19 without complications. 5 Several concerns about this study have been made, mainly due to the small sample size and heterogeneity of diseases and therapies among patients. None had been treated with immunotherapy.",

On the other hand, there were more COVID-19 cases in Italy, Spain, and France, some of them resulting in death. Deaths have been reported in fragile elderly patients in end-stage myeloma. Up to March 25, 2020, two multiple myeloma patients in the US were diagnosed with COVID-19, but they are as yet the first cases.",

Triage all for respiratory symptoms before entering the facilities: it is critical to reduce the exposure to other patients and staff. The number of staff members will probably be reduced; 5. Improve viral diagnosis, even if the level of suspicion is low; 6. Provide as many viable donors as possible for blood supplies; and 7.
