That\u2019s certainly evident in areas of national leadership in many countries, and a few issues that should be scientific ones seem to have been placed in the category of partisan dogma, rather than debatable policy. But when it comes to how we, as scientists, are viewed by the general public, poll after poll1,2 finds that scientists are, largely, trusted to talk about science \u2014 more trusted than journalists, business leaders or elected officials. However, polls also show that our motives are considered suspect. Scientists are frequently perceived as less caring or moral than non-scientists3, and general opinion is split as to whether we should be allowed to weigh in on matters of policy1. I suspect that this ties into another disheartening phenomenon: most Americans (for instance) can\u2019t name a living scientist and don\u2019t know what we actually do.",

But after that, the speed at which the energy propagates depends only on the physical properties of the water. It will travel at constant speed, giving a basically circular expanding ripple.\u201d Suddenly the other professors dropped their own pet theories, saying, \u201cYour answer works best. I was wrong.

The role of physical scientists is less obvious than that of doctors, biologists and chemists, who have a chance to directly contribute to the health of both individuals and society as a whole, as they search for cures, preventive measures or simply palliative care. Physics does, however, play a role in medical procedures. Diagnostic techniques like X-rays and MRI, as well as physical breathing devices (ventilators), all stem from advances in physics.

Many people today seem increasingly prepared to believe what they hear and read if it reinforces their existing biases, while dismissing any opposing arguments. Of course, there have been cases in which scientists have behaved in a similarly dogmatic way, but the scientific method encourages self-criticism. Compare a scientific theory with a conspiracy theory: advocates of the latter would point out that, like any good scientist, they too are sceptics and rationalists who value the importance of evidence. But at its heart, a conspiracy theory is the polar opposite of a scientific one, in that its proponents will seek to assimilate whatever evidence there is against it and interpret it in a way that confirms rather than repudiates their core idea, thus, making it unfalsifiable.",

One feature that many in wider society see wrongly as a weakness is the way scientists value the importance of doubt. Being inflexible about what we believe to be true in science means that our views are no different from an ideological belief. But scientific progress is not made that way. Always maintaining a level of doubt, even about our most cherished scientific theories, is a consequence of our desire to seek the truth, rather than to simply win an argument.",

We don\u2019t know, but it was not created by a giant turtle. What is gravity? We don\u2019t know, but it does not require angels to push planets around the sun. Science is driven by a sense of wonder. The explanations it gives of natural phenomena, which are made by placing limitations on what can be said and done, seem, to me, always more creative and magical than the \u2018nothing-but\u2019 view would suggest.
