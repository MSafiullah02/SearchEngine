            "text": "In 1994, TDR helped establish five international parasite genome networks and opened the door for scientists from disease endemic countries to participate and collaborate in genome and post-genome projects. A great deal of parasite, vector, and host genome data has been produced. The challenge now is developing an understanding to allow translation of genome sequence in order to deliver novel drug targets, structural predictions, characterisation of biodiversity, reconstruction of metabolic pathways, systems biology and identification of vaccine candidate molecules. In order to take these areas beyond the concept of buzzword, a great deal of knowledge transfer has to occur. This presentation will provide context to bioinformatics research in Africa, outline the challenges inherent in understanding of genome data, explore strategies, and provide examples of 'translation'. The majority of emerging diseases threats is of zoonotic origin and of these pathogens, the overwhelming majority are RNA viruses. Examples of important viral threats include agents such as Influenza, SARS, Ebola, Dengue, and Hantavirus. Genomic approaches provide a window to viral evolution and facilitate the study of viral ecology and the relationship between humanity and zoonoses. Due to the relative simplicity of RNA viral genomes the compilation of viral sequence data allows mass comparative genomic analysis and association with epidemiological data at a scale which is currently impossible for other organisms. We are specifically interested in Influenza and Coronoviruses that have the ability to cause diseases that significantly affect both humans and animals. In addition we use novel and high throughput genome sequencing and analysis of viral samples in the context of emerging viral infectious diseases. Our technology platform and results will be presented and discussed.",

This project is providing invaluable resources for the study of taeniasis/cysticercosis, and, in conjunction with the Echinococcus granulosus and E. multilocularis genome projects of expressed sequence tags (EST's) is marking the advent of cestode parasites genomics. The T. solium genome size was estimated at about 270 Mb by cytofluorometry on isolated cyton nuclei. In contrast, several probabilistic calculations based on shotgun sequenced genomic clones, resulted in size estimates of 120-140 Mb. The sequencing is being carried out through a combined strategy of 454 pyrosequencing and traditional capillary sequencing. We consider a 20\u00c2 coverage by pyrosequencing and at least 3\u00c2 by capillary sequencing from small insert shotgun and fosmid end libraries, to obtain a 95% completeness of the genome.",

The BioAfrica website 1 was developed as a web portal and online resource centre for HIV genetic and protein bioinformatics analysis, which gives a special focus on the explosive HIV-1 subtype C epidemic in Southern Africa. Development of the BioAfrica website was started in 2001 by Tulio de Oliveira and Sharon Cassol on the Africa Centre for Health and Population Studies in South Africa in order to manipulate and distribute data produced by their research group. Since then, the website has grown both in size and functionality and presently contains many useful resources and much relevant information for HIV sequence analysis.",

The emphasis on quality requires hits that are chemically amenable to modifications and that have a good physico-chemical as well as specificity profile. For many targets, the combination of molecular docking against NMR and X-ray 3D structures with in silico ADME & Tox profiling can advantageously replace High Throughput Screening for quality hit identification and further speed the optimization process. This approach enables multiobjective lead optimization, where both potency and the pharmacokinetic profile are improved. Key developments in this area include the availability of large lead-like and diverse screening libraries, validated docking methods, improving in silico ADME prediction methods, and integrated experimental screening and crystallography. The current methods build on a vast and growing array of experimental data (physico-chemical properties, activity, 3D structures, etc.). This combination presents an unprecedented opportunity for a large number of laboratories to start drug discovery programs without the need to initially invest in expensive laboratory equipment. The author will present his experience of large scale docking campaigns where several million molecules have been screened and hits progressed towards clinical candidates. In medical sciences, and in widest terms in biology, a target is a broad concept to qualify a biological entity and/or a biological phenomenon, on which one aims to act as part of a therapeutical intervention. Intervention on the target depends on the level of knowledge of the disease and the cultural background of the physician (traditional medicine will focus more on the symptoms in order to end the symptoms; allopathic (western, orthodox) medicine will focus on the causes (i.e. the etiology) in order to oppose the causes of the diseases; homeopathic medicine (in the sense of non-allopathic medicine) will focus on the etiology in order to treat likes with likes; in the widest sense of the word, vaccination is a category of homeopathic treatment). Intervention also relies on the availability of techniques and technologies, e.g. without exogenous agents (surgery, diets), with exogenous biochemicals (natural substances based on traditional pharmacopoeia, drugs derived from traditional pharmacopoeia or from synthetic chemistry, vaccines) or with exogenous genes (gene therapy).",

In silico organisation of genomic and post-genomic information complying with knowledge of the disease in etiologic terms, appears as an efficient source of information to help a target discovery project, as long as accurate analysing and mining tools are available. Objects, attributes and data are consistent with biological entities as defined or understood by bench biologists in reductionist terms, i.e. genes, messengers, proteins, solutes, cellular structures, tissues, organs, etc., and their physiological measures and scales, i.e. mass, size, lengths, concentrations. Processes and functions represent biological operations and alterations over time, growth, transformations, movements, and reactions. Accurate integration of data and assessment of the relations between objects and processes are critical. However, the most striking limitations lie in the analytic and mining tools to explore the stored biological information. In the case of malaria, in spite of an unprecedented effort to organise genomic and postgenomic information regarding its causative agents (Plasmodium sp.) and make it accessible to the largest scientific audience, atypical features of the malarial genomes limit the use of conventional analytical tools.Subsequent objective of a target discovery project, which is from target to lead, drug, vaccine or gene therapy, should not be ignored. The majority of the targets reported in the literature did not open to any realistic therapeutical treatment. An important drawback is the cost of drug development. In this concern, future prospects include the integration of biological and chemical information.",

The incidence of disease is increasing with the AIDS pandemic, and current vaccines and therapies are not 100% efficient, resulting in the emergence of drug resistance. The ability of the organism to evolve resistance to drugs with enhanced pathogenicity appears, at least in part, to be provided by the mechanism of gene duplication. This evolutionary mechanism results in expansion of gene families, thereby providing the organism with extra copies of the gene and thus the opportunity to evolve new functions. This project aimed to identify the expanded gene families in M. tuberculosis and investigate the potential contribution of gene duplication events to pathogenicity. Comparative genomics tools were used to compare the M. tuberculosis proteome to itself and the full protein complement from over 80 other microorganisms, including both pathogens and nonpathogens, to determine the extent of family expansion in each. We investigated the link between gene duplication, genome size and GC content, and selected expanded families from M. tuberculosis that were unique to either M. tuberculosis or pathogens for further analysis. Up to half of all M. tuberculosis proteins belong to expanded families or gene duplicate sets, some of which are unique to this organism or to M. tuberculosis complex organisms, suggesting that they have a role to play in evolution of these genomes. Although the evolution of M. tuberculosis is thought to be relatively recent, the maintenance of these duplicated families in the genome suggests they have a role to play in the pathogenic lifestyle of the organism.",

Butler 3 Until recently, the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae was the only sequenced and annotated mosquito. But in 2006, the genome of Aedes aegypti, the yellow fever vector mosquito, has been released and annotated. Complementing the gene sets, a large amount of data was available: expression and comparison data, domain content information (signal peptide, transmembrane and protein domains) and control vocabulary. With the upcoming sequencing of more disease vectors (Culex pipiens, Ixodes scapularis, Glossina morsitans, etc.), it is becoming important to organise the storing and access to this data. VectorBase is a resource centre for invertebrate vectors of human pathogens and regroups information about these organisms: gene sets and related information, sequences (genomic, ESTs, traces) and pictures. But more than storing, VectorBase is a place for mining data: walk along the genomes, visualise DNA and protein similarities between organisms, compare sequences vs. the hosted genomic sequences (Blast) and build alignments (ClustalW). VectorBase aims to be a main resource centre for the invertebrates disease vector communities, involving the scientists, generating, updating and giving an easy access to the data [http://www.vectorbase.org/index.php]. While attempting to investigate the viruses associated with yellowing and stunting diseases of cool season food legumes in Ethiopia, two new viruses were discovered and characterised. A distinct luteovirus tentatively named as Chickpea chlorotic stunt virus (CpCSV) was found to be associated with most legume crop samples namely faba bean, chickpea, lentil, grass pea and fenugreek collected from Ethiopia. Biological studies indicated that CpCSV is transmitted by the aphid Aphis craccivora but not by A. fabae, Acyrthosiphon pisum or Myzus persicae and has an experimental host range limited to species of cool season food legumes. Electron microscopy showed isometric particles of 28 nm in diameter typical of luteoviruses. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum and 10 mouse monoclonal antibodies were produced, characterised and evaluated for routine use in its diagnosis. Sequencing of the complete genome of an Ethiopian (Ambo) isolate revealed that its linear RNA genome has 5900 nucleotides arranged in six major open reading frames typical to members of genus Polerovirus in the family Luteoviridae. Phylogenetic analysis of the polymerase and coat protein (CP) sequence using Clustal-X program confirmed this classification. Recombination analysis of the genome using Sister scanning procedure suggested that although the virus genome is generally close to Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus, it has acquired a stretch of about 90 amino acids at the C-terminal part of its readthrough domain from ancestral soybean dwarf virus-like ancestor. The CP protein gene sequence of 18 CpCSV isolates from five countries indicated that the virus occurs as two geographically differentiated strains significantly differing in symptom severity, serological properties and nucleotide sequence information.",

The nucleotide sequence of at least two genes encoding for the CP and U1 protein were obtained for representative samples of each serotype. Whereas serotype A and B isolates were similar to those reported elsewhere previously, Serotype C represented a new group. To understand the phylogeny of the later in detail, the complete sequence of the eight distinct circular single stranded DNAs believed to form entire nanovirus genome was obtained from a representative sample (eth-231). Each of these DNAs was about 1 kb in size and code for proteins of 12-35 kDa. Sequence comparison indicated that overall nucleotide similarity of only 70% with Faba bean necrotic yellows virus, its closest relative, suggesting that it is a distinct nanovirus belonging to family Nanoviridae. The study of the broad field of biology relies extensively on the ability to classify and identify individuals to the lowest taxonomic level. It is estimated that 250 years of dedicated taxonomic activity has resulted in an impressive 1.5-1.8 million descriptions, representing only about 2% of all species, estimated at 5-100 million. Unfortunately, expertise in taxonomy based entirely on morphology is becoming more difficult to find, and largely resident in national life science museums. Identifying species accurately is foundational to the ecology of insects that spread disease, and the pathogens they transmit. Although application of unique DNA sequences is not new to species identification, the application of a standardised locus for implementation on a broad scale is, and continues to elicit much debate. The Consortium for the Barcode of Life (CBOL, www.barcoding.si.edu) has identified mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI) as the barcode sequence for animals. Using universal primers described by Folmer et al. (1994) , the barcoding region (as defined by CBOL) we have obtained amplicons from six species of tsetse (G. fuscipes fuscipes, G. pallidipes, G. swynnetoni, G. morsitans morsitans, G. morsitans centralis and G. m. submorsitans). Under our PCR conditions, G. brevipalpis and G. longipennis failed to amplify, hence more optimisation is needed. However, all the six produced high quality sequences in excess of 650 bp from the PCR products. These data demonstrate the utility of COI in identifying tsetse flies to the level of sub-species.",

Presently, little is known about the structures of tRNA in Plasmodium falciparum, so development of computational techniques toward the prediction of tRNA structures will enhance the work on structural based drug design for malaria treatments. Chen and Dill (PNAS, 97, 646-51, 2000) developed a method capable of predicting structures, but its can not work on tRNAs. Lucas and Dill (J Chem Phys 2003;119(4), 2414-21) and Kopeikin and Chen (J. Chem. Phys. 2005;122(9), 1-13) obtained one independently but their techniques worked only for simple structures. In fact, the prediction of Lucas and Dill overestimate in its prediction. In the work that follows, we took a broader look at a larger class of structures and developed a heuristic method for the resulting convoluted problem. Mainly, our technique targets extending the theory on polymer graphs that exist (PNAS, 97, 646-651, 2000) to include pseudoknots. Our experimentation produced enhanced results. Our future work focused on the improvement of our present framework. Based on partial env and pol (protease and RT) subtyping, it was recently documented that the majority (>80%) of the HIV-1 strains that circulate in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire were CRF02_AG and about 11% could not be clearly assigned to a known subtype or Crf (circulating recombinant form). Thus many subtypes A sequences from this country submitted to HIV genome databases are still not assigned to any sub-subtype. So the number of subtype A sequences not assigned to any sub-subtype continues to grow. Inter-and intra-clade variations within pol sequence are particularly relevant as this region encodes RT and protease proteins, against which many antiviral drugs are directed.",

Our results provide insights into the importance of recombinant forms in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire which seems to have been underestimated, and thus indicate that more than 90% of HIV-1 strains are recombinant forms. The objective of this study is to assess polymorphisms at candidate genes associated with genetic resistance to viral diseases in chicken, such as Marek's disease and avian Influenza. Two candidate genes were shortlisted from literature and their sequences obtained from Ensembl. BLB2 (class II) major gene is present in chicken within the MHC region on chromosome 16. It has been shown to be associated with resistance to avian viral infection, including Marek's disease. Mx gene on chromosome 1 is a putative candidate gene for genetic resistance to avian Influenza at position 631 of the encoded amino acid. Species homologs of these two genes were obtained from the NCBI Blast and analysed with the PAML package for detection of signature of positive adaptive selection (dN/dS ratio). This region is encoded by exon 2 of the BLB2 which is important in antigen presentation. In summary site analysis reveals that some amino acids in the CID and PBr domains for the Mx and BLB2 genes, respectively, are under positive selection and this warrants further research on these two protein domains for their exact role towards genetic disease resistance. HIV studies can combine long term clinical monitoring, sequencing of large number of whole or partial viral genomes to assess viral diversity, multi-institutional molecular laboratory assays including immune monitoring, and host genetics. Integrating this form of data across molecular and non-molecular domains is a challenge. In order to maximise the rate at which discoveries can be achieved in our study, we have developed a strategy of leveraging global open source developments to apply and refine in a developing world context. Capturing contextual information together with time series genome sequences from infected subjects is non-trivial. As part of an nIH acute infection study of the Centre for AIDS Programme for research in South Africa, we have developed a Molecular Integration Database (MID). It securely and reliably integrates clinical, immunological and molecular data from infected subjects. The MID leverages open source software developed for model organism genomes such as BioMart for querying and the Generic Genomic Browser (GBrowse) for visualisation. Use of genome project software means that the resultant saving of time and resources in the database's development has been substantial and in return, the developing world, where infection is endemic, and its open source community will benefit from the release of the source code of the MID and its HIV sequence assembly pipeline. Plasmodium falciparum, the pathogenic agent responsible for malaria, causes close to 3 millions human deaths each year in the world. Its genome, published in 2002, remains poorly understood. Among its $5000 genes, $3000 have a totally unknown biological function. Several reasons explain this situation, the first one being a totally atypical genome composition which renders ineffective the usual methods of functional annotation based on sequence comparison (alignment) with homologous genes in nearby organisms. Nonhomology methods are thus needed to obtain functional clues for the orphan genes. Notably, transcriptomic analysis using DNA microarrays have been proposed. These approaches are based on the hypothesis that uncharacterised genes may potentially share functional roles with annotated genes of similar transcriptomic profile, a principle known as ''Guilt by Association'' (GBA). Interestingly, this intra-species principle can also be apply to other type of available postgenomic data, such as proteomic data or protein interaction data.",

The result is an assessed functional draft of the P. falciparum orphan genes. This draft has been integrated in a database available on the web and that can be accessed in different ways. A global view allows to rapidly inspect the branches of the ontology that are more suitable for the GBA principle using the considered type of data (transcriptome, proteome, and protein interaction data). Moreover, user can query the database to search for the potential GO terms of one particular gene, or to search for all the genes that potentially belong to a given GO term. Web site: http://atgc.lirmm.fr/plasmo_draft/ Leishmania is a major parasitic disease in the world for which no vaccine is available and drugs are toxic. As part of its research programme on host-parasite interaction, the LIVGM (Laboratoire d'Immunologie Vaccinologie et G\u00e9 n\u00e9 tique Mol\u00e9 culaire) has constructed four human macrophage SAGE libraries, either non-infected or infected by Leishmania, and one Leishmania promastigote library. The aim of this ''SAGE project'' is to dissect the impact of intracellular infection on the expression of macrophage genes. The aim of the present project is to identify and classify Leishmania derived tags, to evaluate the expression of Leishmania genes and to identify those upor down-regulated in the amastigote stage. The challenge is due to the fact that: (i) very few full length Leishmania cDNAs are available in public databases; (ii) the only Leishmania gene evidences are the CDS predictions available in GeneDB (www.genedb.org); and (iii) tags are normally located in the 3 0 -UTR (outside the CDS). We will present here the strategy followed in order to assign Leishmania tags to the corresponding transcripts/gene and to analyse their expression level: (i) Leishmania tags mapping was done using Blast; (ii) the association tag-to-gene was done using Gaussian kernels; (iii) the analysis of differential expression was done using the binomial distribution. The production of increasingly reliable and accessible expression data has stimulated the development of computational tools to interpret such data and to organise them efficiently. The clustering techniques are largely recognised as useful exploratory tools for gene expression data analysis. Genes that show similar expression patterns over a wide range of experimental conditions can be clustered together. This relies on the hypothesis that genes that belong to the same cluster are co-regulated and involved in related functions. Clustering involves working with a data matrix in which the rows represent the genes, the columns represent the experiments, and each entry represents the expression level of a gene in a given experiment. There exist many clustering algorithms which take microarray data sets as input and produce clusters as output. In spite of the fact that a variety of different clustering algorithms is now available, a number of important questions remain to be addressed. Especially, the estimation of the number of clusters represented in an expression data set is a crucial and complex task, which may significantly influence the outputs of an analysis process.",

It is hypothesised that identification of CTL target schizont antigens will aid the development of a sub-unit vaccine. We exploited the availability of the complete genome sequence data and bioinformatics tools to identify genes encoding secreted or membrane anchored proteins that may be processed and presented by the MHC class I molecules of infected cells to CTL. A 525 base pair Orf encoding a 174 amino acid protein, designated Tp2, was identified by T. parva-specific CTL from four animals. These CTL recognised and lysed Tp2 transfected skin fibroblasts and recognised four distinct epitopes. Significantly, Tp2 specific CD8+ T cell responses were observed during the protective immune response against sporozoite challenge. This makes Tp2 an attractive candidate for evaluation of its vaccine potential.

At each step of the funnel and depending on tuning, a small proportion of molecules can be prioritised as more promising, discarding a large body of inappropriate ligands. VSM-G is able to handle several millions of compounds vs. hundreds of targets (which can be different targets or several conformations of same one, e.g. extracted from molecular dynamics sampling or nMr data), yielding to a small set of putative hit compounds to be proposed for real biological testing.",

We also foresee to apply our virtual screening process to a subset of the targets proposed by the TDR drug target portfolio network: http://www.who.int/tdr/tropics/ discovery_research/drug_target.htm In a longer term, our vision goes beyond virtual screening and we call for a distributed, internet-based collaboration [3] to address one of the worst plagues of our present world, malaria. The spirit is a non-proprietary peer-production of informationembedding goods. And we propose to use the grid technology to enable such a world wide open-source like collaboration. 3 kDa, respectively, shows strong homologies with triple gene block proteins. ORF 5 encodes the capsid protein of 33 kDa and ORF 6 encodes a protein of 15 kDa with a nucleic acid binding zinc finger motif. Based on the genomic organisation SPCFV appears to be a member of the genus Carlavirus with the family Flexiviridae. Comparison of the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of the putative polymerase and coat protein with the members of Flexiviridae also showed highest similarities with the corresponding gene products of carlaviruses. However, SPCFV takes a position close, but clearly separate from the carlaviruses, as none of its putative gene products shared amino acid sequence similarities of >40% with the homologues of other carlaviruses. Based on CP sequences, its closest relative among the carlaviruses is Melon yellowing-associated virus, a proposed carlavirus from Brazil with which it shares 46% aa homology. The larger RN A (9104 nt) of SPCFV in comparison to other carlaviruses (7.4-8.5 kb) is largely due to the considerably larger replicase (238 vs. 200-223 kDa) and the considerably long un-translated region between ORF 4 and the putative CP (213 vs. ca. 34 nt for PVM). Although SPCFV had earlier been regarded as a potyvirus, our data provided unambiguous evidence for its assignment as a distinct species to the genus Carlavirus. The need to integrate computational power and techniques in biological research in the African continent is crucial in tackling disease, food insecurity and managing genetic resources. The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) is supporting efforts that will enhance the integration of computation in biological research and exploitation of the numerous bioinformatics resources in research. Currently, IITA is conducting basic in silico research on phytopathogens of the African major food crops. The genus Xanthomonas is a diverse and economically important group of phytopathogens, belonging to the subdivision of the Proteobacteria. The species and pathovars, cause distinct disease phenotypes in a wide range of plants. Pathogenicity islands (PAIs), distinct genomic segments encoding virulence factors, represent a subgroup of genomic islands (GIs) that have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer event. Identification of potential PAI is useful in understanding disease pathogenicity, host specificity and genomic evolution in microbial genomes. In this study, we are utilising an in silico approach to detect potential PAI(s) in six complete Xanthomonas genomes by combining sequence homology and abnormalities in genomic composition. We will first identify the GI(s) in the genomes, by calculating the G + C content anomalies and codon usage bias. All the PAI loci will be collected and their homologs identified in the genomes to come up with genomic strips. An algorithm will then be developed to merge overlapping or adjacent strips into large genomic regions. Among the defined genomic regions, PAI-like regions will be identified by the presence of homolog(s) of virulence genes. Candidate PAI (cPAI) will be considered only if the PAI-like region partly or entirely spans the GI. The identification and analysis of cPAI in Xanthomonas will broaden our knowledge on disease phenotype diversity, host specificity and genomic evolution in these phytopathogenic bacteria. The parasitic angiosperm, Striga gesnerioides is a root parasite of wild and cultivated legumes, among which cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is suitable host. In West Africa, it causes serious yield losses up to 100% in some instances. Based upon the differential resistance response of various cultivars and breeding lines, five distinct races of S. gesnerioides parasitic on cowpea have been proposed to exist in west and central Africa. But the race of the parasite present in Senegal is not well known. Understanding the genetic structure and host-parasite interaction of S. gesnerioides from Senegal is important because it allows identification of races or biotypes thus improving chances of breeding success. Using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) profile analysis and statistical clustering methods, we have examined the genetic variability and phenotpicic relationships of 215 individual's plants representing 12 different populations of S. gesnerioides collected from various areas throughout their suspected distribution range in Senegal. Our results showed that most genetic diversity resided among populations (91%) which are consistent with the breeding system of S. gesnerioides. Based on its genetic profile and host preference/resistance responses more race of the parasite seems to be present in Senegal. The most popular race of striga from Senegal and the race present in Mali are closely related. The var gene family of Plasmodium falciparum encodes for the variant surface antigen PfEMP1 (P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1). PfEMP1 is considered an important pathogenicity factor in P. falciparum infection by mediating cytoadherence to host cell intermediate groups (B/A and B/C) on the basis of their genomic location and upstream sequence similarities in coding and non-coding upstream regions. Severe malaria may be caused by parasites expressing restricted subset of PfEMP1 variants that confer optimal sequestration in immunologically naive individuals. Studies on var gene expression are difficult due to the broad variability of var genes in field isolates. A case control study was set in Ifakara, Tanzania, children under age of five years with severe malaria were recruited using WHO 2000 guideline of case definition, and children with asymptomatic malaria were enrolled in a study as a control group. Expression patterns of different fragments of var genes sequences were compared. We found that P. falciparum isolates from children with severe malaria predominantly transcribe var genes with DBL1like domains that are characteristic of Group A or B/A var genes with reduced cysteine residues. In contrast, isolates from children with asymptomatic malaria predominantly transcribe var genes with DBL1-like domains that are characteristic of the B-and C-related var gene groups. Initial phylogenic analysis showed that dominant expressed var genes from severe malaria isolates cluster together, if compared with dominant expressed var genes from asymptomatic isolates. These preliminary results support the hypothesis that var genes with DBL1-like domains (Group A or B/A) may be implicated in the pathogenesis of severe malaria. On regular basis, enormous amounts of genomic data are generated by researchers. Forming a large part of these huge raw data resources is the malaria microarray data arising from the study of gene expression in both Plasmodium infected mosquito and human beings to understand their biology and evolve new drug remedies. Malaria, caused by Plasmodium falciparum, is lethal and responsible for major losses and death in sub-Saharan Africa. The purpose of microarray is to measure the concentration of mRNA for thousands of genes at given time points. Since data analysis have profound influence on interpretation of the final results, basic understanding of the underlying model surrounding computational tools is required for optimal experimental design and data analysis by biology researchers who are target users of such tools. k-means is one of the popular and simple partition computational models for clustering microarray data but has the problem of requesting for number of clusters from researchers who may not have idea about the structure of the data to be clustered. In this work, we analyse the operational iteration mechanism of kmeans by what we call Step-by-step k-means walk using synthetic gene expression data. However, we also examine the results of analysis of k-means and other clustering techniques on malaria microarray data (MMD) with the objective of revealing their strength and weakness on existing experimental works. We discover open problems that are both computational and experimental based, with K-means clustering having further problems of sensitivity to initialisation and also often find solutions that are local optimum and apparently far from global optimum. There is also the need for a new microarray experiment which ultimately raises some design issues. Our new simplified K-means algorithm for clustering (for example) gene expression data arising from malaria microarray experiment will be capable of fitting adequate number of genes clusters required for any given microarray input data set automatically without guessing k (number of clusters) input. Plasmodium species belong to the phylum apicomplexa. Plasmodium, Toxoplasma and Cryptosporidium are parasites of considerable medical importance while Theireria and Eimeria are animal pathogens with extensive impact on food production. Plasmodium falciparum is particularly important because it causes malaria that has 300-500 million clinical infections, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and results in more than 1 million deaths each year. The malaria parasite actively invades the host cell in which they propagate and several proteins associated with the apical organelles have been implicated to be crucial in the invasion process. The biogenesis of the apical organelles is not well understood but several studies indicate that microtubulebased vesicular transport is involved. In P. falciparum, the microtubule destabilising drugs, colchicine, dinitoanilines and taxotere considerably reduce the number of new rings in culture or completely tachyzoites treated with oryzin or colchicine loses bulk of the subpellicular microtubules and the ability to re-invade host cells. At a higher drug concentration, the nascent spindle and the microtubules are disrupted and the parasites are incapable of nuclear division. Immunofluorescence studies indicate the presence of microtubule based proteins at the apical organelle and have suggested that cytoplasmic dyneins maybe involved in the biogenesis of this organelle, and also in the replication of these parasites. Other studies have shown the presence homologues of vesicle mediated transport (COP, Sec23/31, N SF) inside the parasite and in the trans-cellular transport in P. falciparum infected erythrocytes but their precise role is not investigated. Dynein is a multi-subunit complex composed of heavy chains whose C-terminus form a globular head containing multiple ATP-hydrolysis sites and a small stalk that binds to microtubules while the N-terminus is a flexible stem that interacts with intermediate chains and light chains to form the cargo binding domain of the enzyme. In this study, we analysed the light chains of P. falciparum because they provide adaptor surface to the cargoes and, therefore, there is likelihood for variations. The cytoplasmic dynein light chains consist of three different families: TcTex1/2, LC8 and LC7/roadblock. TcTex1/2 are differentially expressed in various tissues and have been implicated in the attachment of cargoes to dynein motor. Vertebrates TcTex1 binds directly to rhodosin and disruption of the protein leads to retinitis pigmentosa. The LC8 protein family is highly conserved and is found in many multimeric enzymes including nitric oxide synthase and myosin V. Complete loss of LC8 function is embryonic lethal. The LC7/roadblock family has been shown to bind directly to the intermediate chains of dynein complex. The data presented demonstrate that the P. falciparun dynein light chains sequence and functional domains show high sequence homology within the apicomplexa and that only the dynein LC 8 group2 (97 a.a.) has a high homology (e -40) to human while TcTex1 and dynein LC7 group1 (93 a.a.) have low homology (e -08, e -05, respectively) to the human homologues. This suggests that the sequence/domain differences in these proteins can be targeted for vaccine or drug design. The trypanosome ribosomal P proteins are located on the stalk of the ribosomal large subunit they where play a critical role during the elongation step of protein synthesis. The single chain recombinant antibody (scFv) C5 recognises the conserved C-terminal end of the Trypanosoma cruzi ribosomal P proteins although it possesses very low affinity for the corresponding mammalian epitope. We show that scFvC5 is able to specifically block the protein synthesis in vivo in Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent for sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle. In transgenic parasites, the mRNA corresponding to scFvC5 could be amplified by R T-PCR and the protein product was detectable by Western blot. Indirect immunofluorescence assay shows a cytoplasmic distribution similar to that obtained with purified scFvC5 on wild type parasites. Transfected parasites showed abnormal cell size, accompanied by growth arrest, consistent with a blockade of protein synthesis. Analogues to trypanosome scFv C5 antibody could be potential candidates as novel antiparasitic agents. Genome-scale comparisons of plant pathogen sequences are being made possible by the increasing availability of completely sequenced bacterial genomes. There is need to design pathogen diagnostic kits for the rapid and specific identification of newly emerging bacterial strains. These comparisons offer the opportunity of designing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers based on the variability of the intergenic regions for the amplification of products from target taxa and not from non-target taxa for the identification of pathogens at various taxonomic levels. In this study, an in silico bioinformatics approach is used to design primers from the Xanthomonas genomes available at the Comprehensive Microbial Resource website of The Institute of Genomic Research (http://www.cmr.tigr.org). Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri 306 was chosen as the reference species and the intergenic regions that are 400-800 bp in length were viewed to see genes that flank the 5 0 and 3 0 end of these regions, conserved and in synteny across the Xanthomonas campestris, X. axonopodis and X. oryzae species after performing a homology search. A multiple alignment of the intergenic regions flanked by these conserved genes was done and analysed using Amplicon software. Preliminary results support the logic that intergenic-targeted primers could be designed from the conserved region for specific identification of Xanthomonas bacteria at the genus, species and pathovar level. The process whereby erythrocytes containing mature forms of P. falciparum adhere to micro vascular endothelial cells of vital organs and thus disappear from circulation is known as sequestration (cytoadherence). This process is mediated by a family of strain specific high molecular weight parasite derived proteins known as P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1. This protein is exported to the surface of infecting erythrocyte where it is anchored to a submembraneous accretion of parasite derived histidine-rich protein which becomes the points of attachment to the vascular endothelium. This adhesive protein is the only parasite protein unequivocally present on the outside of the erythrocyte. This project therefore, aims at identification, isolation and biochemical characterisation of this variant surface protein (PfEMP1) which mediates sequestration in placenta of infected women and is believed to be the main antigen determining the parasite population structure during chronic malarial infection of falciparum. The isolated protein will be characterised to determine the amino acid composition as well as the N-terminal amino acid sequence. Depending on the sequence obtained, chemically synthesised peptides will be used to study immunological reactions of the protein when induced as an immunogen. Monoclonal antibodies will be produced against the purified protein and since they are site specific reagents, they will be applied in the investigations of the protein to identify the immunogenic regions in the conformation of the protein. The synthesised peptides will act as an antigen for specific immunological purpose for example, vaccine production to intractable or difficult pathogens like Plasmodium.",

Five isolates with the highest activity against P. falciparum were identified and classified using the 16S rDNA analysis.

Phylogenetic analysis of the partial sequences showed that the isolates cluster together with Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus sonorensis, Bacillus subtilis, and Pseudobacillus carolinae species. Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite which has emerged as one of the most common opportunistic infections in HIV/AIDS patients. Parasites can escape immune attack, by differentiation into bradyzoites (cysts) which reside predominantly in the brain, and are able to persist for the life of the host. Toxoplasmosis in AIDS patients is considered to be as a result of reactivation of latent infection. In the expressed sequence tag database, deoxyribose phosphate aldolase (Dpa) was found to be specifically expressed in the T. gondii cyst (bradyzoites). We analysed the expression of T. gondii Dpa (TgDPA) in toxoplasma bradyzoites and tachyzoites by R T-PCR and for the first time we here by report that TgDPA is highly expressed in the Toxoplasma bradyzoites. The hypothesis of the present study was that dpa is involved in cyst formation and therefore the involvement of TgDPA in cyst formation is very crucial as an entry point in drug development against Toxoplasmosis based on cyst formation. A gene encoding TgDPA was identified in the T. gondii strain R H by comparative sequence analysis and gene cloning. The gene encoded a protein of 286 amino acids, having a predicted molecular weight of 31 kDa. The gene was cloned into pGEX-5X1 vector and the resulting recombinant plasmid pGEX-5X1/dpa was transformed into Escherichia coli DH5 and the recombinant protein was expressed then used for antibody production in mice and in rabbit. The antibody titers against the protein were analysed by western blotting. The results indicated the successful production of anti-Dpa antibody, which react with a 34 kDa protein. Immunofluorescent antibody test in the parasites showed that TgDPA was localised in bradyzoites cytoplasm. These findings suggest that dpa could be involved in cyst formation and has a potential to impact on public health initiatives. Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for the high mortality rate of malaria in sub-Sahara Africa. In an attempt to monitor this disease and provide valuable information to the anti-malarial drug programme, we have surveyed malaria parasites from several geographically distinct areas in Kenya that represent varying degrees of drug resistance, drug usage patterns and levels of malaria transmission. Malaria specimens collected from Busia, Malindi, Mumias, and Kisumu were evaluated for drug susceptibility against a panel of 15 known anti-malarial drugs. DNA was isolated from these samples for the determination of specific mutations in the genes that have been correlated with drug resistance which include Pfdhfr, Pfdhps, Pfmdr1, and Pfcrt. We find a decrease in the number of mutations in Pfmdr1 and Pfcrt from parasites isolated from areas where chloroquine is rarely used to treat malaria. In contrast, parasites collected from areas that are believed to still treat malaria with chloroquine have substantial mutations in Pfmdr1 and Pfcrt. In vitro drug sensitivity assays demonstrate that a decrease in the number of mutations in Pfmdr1 and Pfcrt correlates with an increase in chloroquine susceptibility. In those areas of Kenya where Fansidar (Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine combination) has replaced chloroquine as the first line treatment for malaria, we find an increase in mutations in Pfdhps that corresponds to an increase in sulfadoxine resistance. We also did not observe any mutations at codons 164 for Pfdhfr and 581 and 613 for Pfdhps. The absence of these mutations is consistent with parasites isolated from East Africa during previous studies and reflects a lesser degree of drug resistance as that seen in Southeast Asia. Rice yellow mottle virus sobemovirus (RYMV), causal agent of the rice yellow mottle disease transmitted by beetles, is at the origin of an emergent disease of rice in Africa. Isolates of each of the countries where the disease was observed were sequenced. The spatial structure of the diversity, the relations between genetic and geographical distance, as well as the phylogeny suggest an initial diversification of RYMV in East Africa, followed by a temporal spread from east to west of the African continent. The objective of this study is to assess the rate of substitution of RYMV, then to infer the dates of emergence and the speed of dispersal throughout Africa. In this study, we use BEAST, a cross-platform programme for Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis of molecular sequences. The rate of nucleotide substitutions (per site and per year) of the RYMV dates of divergence from temporally spaced sequence data were estimated by Bayesian inference from the sequences of a large collection of the virus (40 years). The temporally spaced data help to follow the accumulation of mutations over time and thus to estimate the mutation rate using coalescent-based population genetic inference. This rate of change, the first one for a plant virus, was compared with those of a set of animal and human viruses. It then served to calibrate the phylogenetic tree of RYMV. Dates of appearance of the virus in various regions of Africa were determined under the hypothesis of relaxed molecular clock using Bayesian MCMC method implemented in BEAST. Finally, the speed of dispersal of RYMV throughout Africa was estimated. These estimations were compared with the epidemiological data on rice yellow mottle disease, with the history of rice in Africa and with the dispersal modes of the vector beetles to identify factors responsible of the emergence of the RYMV. Ecological studies indicate that tsetse flies in the morsitans group have great capacity for dispersal and colonisation of suitable habitats. However, genetic data from nuclear and mitochondrial DNA markers seem to indicate otherwise. The apparent inconsistency between ecological and genetic estimates begs further research. We investigated the breeding structure of the tsetse fly, Glossina pallidipes at micro-and macrogeographic scales by analysing spatial and temporal variation at eight microsatellite loci. Our data suggest that there is little gene flow between populations separated by as few as 50 km leading to strong measures of genetic differentiation. These results show that G. pallidipes tend to remain close to their neighbourhoods. However, the number of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers used in this study were very few and could have led to substantial inter-and intra-locus variance. Ongoing Glossina genome sequencing project offers an opportunity to mine the data for more SSR markers. The potential benefits of this approach are herein discussed. Genetic resistance and susceptibility to infectious diseases involves a complex array of immune-response and other genes with variants that impose subtle but significant consequences on gene expression or protein function. Numerous studies have identified a role for HLA genotype in AIDS outcomes, implicating many HLA alleles in various aspects of HIV disease. The complexity of the immune responses can be tackled by high thorough put computational methods. The current study examined how individual susceptibility and protections to HIV-1/AIDS are affected by the diversity of HLA-A in the population.",

            "text": "In the 17 alleles queried eight were susceptible to HIV-1/AIDS with number of epitopes less than 38, while nine were protective with epitopes number greater than 38. HLA-A *3002 allele had the highest number of epitopes suggesting that individuals with this HLA-A are likely to generate strong immune responses to HIV-1 envelop glycoprotein. Our data suggests that HIV-1 immune responses on the envelop glycoprotein depends on HLA-A allele. This approach is significant in determining epitopes that can be used in the design of the epitope-based vaccine and in epidemiological studies of resistance and susceptibility to HIV-1. To date, 3000 couples attending voluntary counseling and testing centres (VCTs) in Nairobi, have been tested for HIV-1, of whom 8% were HIV-1 discordant, 9.2% were concordant HIV-1 positive and 82.8% were concordant HIV-1 negative. The HIV-1 discordant group will be enrolled and incidence and predictors of heterosexual transmission monitored at 3-month intervals for seroconversion of the seronegative partner. Gp120 and P24 regions will be amplified by PCR analysis of blood samples from both partners and sequenced. In the final set of experiments, evolutionary linkage to incidence will be assessed by phylogenetic tree analysis. It is expected that phylogenetic data derived from this study will shade important insights into HIV-1 transmission dynamics in discordant couples in the developing world. In our recent study, we developed HIV and adenoviral vectors as model probes for antiviral screening. These viral-vector-based assays were found to be rapid, specific, reproducible and safe. Our present research focuses on the use of computational and predictive tools to circumvent the major challenges limiting the optimal use of adenoviral vectors in vaccine deliveries. Low pathogenicity, high infectivity and ability to accommodate large size transgene have made adenoviruses useful and popular candidate in vaccine delivery. The occurrence of circulatory adenoviral antibodies in human, induced by passive infection limits the vector titre and hence the delivered vaccine titre. The second challenge is the use of computational methods to circumvent the possibility of disseminated adenoviral diseases in replication-competent viruses and the problem of low vector titre with replication-defective vectors. The third challenge is to predictively construct adenoviral vectors with high ability to infect replicating and non-replicating cells. In this poster I will use an example of a Plasmodium falciparum surface protease (enzyme) to illustrate a putative methodology using existing bioinformatics software and tools, first to identify, and then characterise binding sites/hotspots on the protein surfaces of putative drug targets. These characterised binding sites can then be used for subsequent anti-malarial drug design. The WHO/TDR malaria strategic research project, through its product research and development, has identified several molecular targets in Plasmodium that could be exploited for the development of new drugs against malaria. These include the protease responsible for secondary processing of the P. falciparum merozoite surface protein (MSP-1). Though the TDR research and development has gone on to design and synthesise three possible inhibitors of this protease, there is still room for development of other inhibitors. Proper and accurate Drug (inhibitor) design is determined, among other things, by accurate knowledge of the target protein's surface. I use sequence retrieval to obtain the protein sequence of the P. falciparum surface protease from the NCBI protein database. This is followed by sequence comparison (Blast) with the entire Protein Data Bank (PDB) (1, 2) , to identify the closest protein (evalue must be >1 \u00c010 ) with known 3D structure. The identified protein is then taken through QsiteFinder, a binding site prediction method which uses an energy based method to predict binding spots on the protein's surface. The predicted sites are then characterised by volume, coordinates and surrounding protein residues. This avails a reasonable catalogue of feasible binding hotspots on the P. falciparum surface protease, which could be used for drug (inhibitor) design.",

Architecture of AChE active site gorge is characterised by functional motifs comprising a hydrophobic pocket, the H-bond network, the acyl pocket, and the peripheral site. Screening for differential interaction of bivalent ligands occupying both the catalytic and peripheral sites, with insect and vertebrate AChEs is important in the design of selective insecticides. Dimeric tacrines with varying methylene linkers (C2-C12) were used to probe B. germanica (CSMA strain), A. gambiae and human AChE active site gorge and data for bovine AChE was adapted from a study by Munoz-Ruiz et al. (2005) . Dimeric tacrines were found to be more potent in vertebrate AChE, especially bovine, than in insects (Potency was ca. 16,000 and 82,500-fold higher for bovine AChE than for BgAChE and AgAChE, respectively). The potency of dimeric tacrines was more tether length dependent in vertebrate AChE than in insect AChEs. Insect AChE had unique C6 bump whereby the potency decreased seven-fold and twofold for BgAChE and AgAChE, respectively. Such a change occurs in a difference of a single carbon length indicating a significant interaction of the bivalents at C5 compared to C6 with the active site amino acid moieties. Further tests are on-going with other insects to confirm our hypothesis that this bump is unique in insects. We further performed a sequence analysis for the ace-1 sequence using the DeepView-Swiss-PdbViewer (http://expasy.org/spdbv/) to determine the 3D arrangement of catalytic signatures in the AChE active site gorge. We used ClustalW for alignment and homology analysis and the Treeview in the visualisation of the cladogram for the sequences. Possible applications of the 'C 6 bump' and differential interaction of catalytic motifs of AChEs to the molecular design of highly potent, insect-specific anticholinesterases that are less toxic humans will be discussed. Maesanin a naturally occurring benzoquinone from plant Maesa lanceolata that inhibits growth of a wide range of microorganism. It has been shown to have antibacterial, antifungal antihelminth and more recently antitrypanosomal activity was established. This suggests that it could have some important pharmacological activity. To gain further insight into the mechanism of inhibition by maesanin, glucose catabolism in bloodstream and procyclic T. brucei brucei was studied. Respiration by the bloodstream forms of T. brucei brucei was studied at increasing concentrations of maesanin with glucose as the substrate. This was done by incubating about 5 \u00c2 10 7 trypanosomes at different concentration of measanin for 0-30 min. At 25 mM maesanin, all the parasites were immotile after 10 min. This was compared with motility when parasites were incubated with Salicyl Hydroxamic acid (SHAM), cyanide, antimycin and a combination of cyanide and SHAM. Maesanin unlike the other inhibitors showed complete inhibition. Respiration by the bloodstream forms of T. brucei brucei incubated in phosphate saline glucose (5 mM, glucose) at pH 8.0 was studied at increasing concentrations of maesanin. It was observed that maesanin steadily inhibited the rates of oxygen consumption and the trypanosomes died rapidly within 5 min of incubation. At concentration of 2.5 mM maesanin per 10 8 trypanosomes, the O 2 consumption was completely inhibited. Inhibition by (SHAM) and cyanide was about 80% and 90% under the same conditions respectively. However the parasites were not completely immotile as in the case of measanin. The rate of pyruvate production was also studied at increasing concentrations of measanin. It was observed that increasing concentration of measanin decreased the rate of pyruvate production by T. brucei brucei. The above results suggested that maesanin could be inhibiting a vital energy production step in these parasites. Research and training programmes are mainly oriented towards national health and/or economic problems such as rabies, leishmaniases, tuberculosis, viral hepatitis, bovine theileriosis, veterinary microbiology, genetic disorders and scorpion or snake envenomations. Molecular biology applications perfectly integrated in the research programmes of the Institute can be tracked back to the early 90s, providing a unique context for promoting bioinformatics and its applications at the national and regional level, in highly relevant research areas, particularly for Health. The diversity of the research activities, their complementarities, their unique combination within the health research system, the levels of expertise generated, and the North-South and South-South collaborations developed, contribute to this unique position. Bioinformatics is crucial and takes advantage of the last decade explosion of molecular biology and genomics data, to support and to be supported by the ''wet research'' laboratories. The implementation of bioinformatics at IPT was done in six steps, with the support and following the recommendations of the UNICEF/WHO/UNDP/World Bank Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR), the Re\u00b4seau International des Instituts Pasteurs (RIIP), the Ministry of High Education, and the Ministry of Health: (i) PhD and Post-Doctoral training of a resource scientist having a mathematics background (September 1996-October 2004); (ii) continuous short term training of staff and students (from 1998 to date) through some of the high quality bioinformatics courses organised by TDR (n = 8), Institut Pasteur in Paris (n = 4), and ICGEB-Trieste (n = 3); (iii) a dynamics of bioinformatics research projects development has been initiated in 2001 through a project supported by TDR promoting institutional networking on leishmaniases and tuberculosis followed by other projects successfully funded by TDR and by Institut Fran\u00e7ais de la Coope\u00b4ration or to be supported by the European Commission (SysCo project); (iv) upgrading the institute's hardware (one PC per scientist, servers, backup system), software and network infrastructure (Local network: Ethernet (10/100) and 1 Go for the backbone; internet connection: special line of 2 Mb/s) and dedicated buildings; (v) participating actively to the organisation of international introductory or advanced bioinformatics courses, and offers a national Master's degree in bioinformatics; (vi) recruiting the trained bioinformaticist (December 2004), starting and equipping a bioinformatics group (March 2005) . Four core functions have been assigned to the bioinformatics group: user support, bioinformatics support and establishment of an interface with ''wet laboratories'', in-house training, and R/D. As an added value to the development of its activities, the bioinformatics group have started collaborations with different bioinformatics centres (e.g.: the SANBI, South Africa, the Max-Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics, Germany, BIOBASE, Germany, IBDML, France) and is currently contributing to the development of adequate human resources. A third of the human population carries latent TB. The pathogen uses poorly understood complex strategies to subvert macrophage-killing activities. We will present here an in silico global integrative approach aiming at predicting protein-protein interactions in infected and non-infected macrophages (host-host, pathogenpathogen and host-pathogen). To achieve this goal, the set of MTB protein-protein interactions available in the public domain and the large set of human protein-protein interactions available in the Agile Protein Interaction DataAnalyzer (APID: http://bioinfow.dep.usal.es/apid/index.htm) will be put into physiological context, using expression data from the Gene expression Omnibus database (GEO), literature mining and Gene Ontology annotations (GO). Then, using PPI network analysis methods based on graph theory PRODISTIN (Brun et al., 2003, Genome Biology; Baudot et al., 2006, Bioinformatics; http://crfb.univ-mrs.fr/webdistin/), the modular composition of each network will be determined and compared to each other. Differences in module composition between infected and noninfected macrophages are expected to point towards the biological processes which are preferentially targeted by the pathogen, activated in response to the infection and are responsible for the disease phenotype. Currently, a statistical test is being developed to rank the reliability of APID interactions in order to better predict the set of proteins that is effectively interacting in infected and non-infected macrophages.",

The African continent, which is the most severely affected by vector borne diseases, lacks adequate infrastructures and personal resources required for rational uses of genomic information. To fill this gap, the African Centre for Training in Functional Genomics of Insect vectors of Human Disease (AFROVECTGEN) was initiated by WHO/TDR and the Department of Medical Entomology and Vector Ecology (DMEVE) of the Malaria Research and Training Centre (MRTC) in Mali. The aim of the AFROVECTGEN programme is to train young scientists in functional genomics who will ultimately use genome sequence data for research on insect vectors of human diseases. Over the past 3 years, the African centre for training in insect disease vector functional genomics has contributed to the training of more than 40 junior scientists across the continent through a series of twoweek workshops sponsored by TDR/WHO. The training is focused on three main areas: Molecular Biology with emphasis on molecular entomology, Applied Bio-Informatics and Microarray Technology and Data Analysis. Research and training opportunities for carrier development in genomics research on insects vector of human diseases at the Malaria Research and Training Center will be presented. We will present and make a demo of PhyML, a software that implements a fast and accurate heuristic for estimating maximum likelihood phylogenies from DNA and protein sequences. This tool provides the user with a number of options (a large range of evolutionary models, estimation of various evolutionary parameters, bootstrapping, fast LRT of branch supports, several tree space search strategies, etc.), in order to perform comprehensive phylogenetic analyses on large data sets in reasonable computing time. This software is widely used and highly cited, and a new version (PhyML 3.0) will be available shortly. Users can download the binaries (Windows, Mac, Linux, and several other OS) or analyse their data via our web server. Papers, documentation, binaries, web server are available from http://atgc.lirmm.fr/phyml/. Despite major attempts over the past century to control malaria, this infection is still a life threatening disease affecting half a billion humans in underdeveloped and developing countries. Its global heartland is Africa, with an appalling death toll of 1-2 million people every year. Drug and vaccine research in malaria has a high priority. However, identification of suitable enzyme or antigens as candidates against malaria parasites development in human or in its vector mosquito has been on molecular biology mechanism of malaria life cycle. Genomic and post genomic studies has made the search of new drugs and vaccines easier. Urgent collaboration between endemic countries, and academic research institutions in developed country, i.e. required to address new and inexpensive drug discovery methods. We describe here a partnership development and implementation between the University of Bamako, Mali and the University of Henry Poincare of Nancy I, France. This collaboration aims to strengthen Malian capacity on computational biology and to create a platform and network between North and South for post genomic data integration and interpretation. Share data and allow research institutions to focus their clinical trials on the most promising potential targets. We aim to perform large scale functional genomic study to understand molecular mechanism that govern the Plasmodium life cycle. Genomic and proteomic data provided by functional genomic study can be integrated and interpreted by using computational power full tool and could allow us to identify suitable metabolic pathway targets. Structural bioinformatic tools can then be used to determine and predict protein structures and their molecular docking with drug candidate structures for the specific inhibitor research. We hope this collaboration will first strengthen our institute by allowing transfer of functional genomic and structural bioinformatics technology. In the long term we hope to develop new innovative drugs or vaccines that can inhibit parasite life cycle development in the host and vector. The 3D molecular structure of ClpQy will be obtained from www.pdb.org. The physicochemical parameters of ClpQy (such as molecular weight, isoelectric point, etc.) will be determined using the SwissProt online machine. Ligand structures shall be obtained from the Cambridge Structural Database 1 , and/or Chemical Abstracts Online 1 , and/or LOPAC-1280 1 , and/or TRANSFAC 3.5 1 , etc. Rational molecular modification of known proteases inhibitors shall be done to afford other compounds for computational screening. Phenyl and heterocyclic structures will be selected using QUEST 1 . The generated structures will be screened against the ClpQy protein structure with DOCK3.5 1 in the contact score mode and structures with scores above acceptable value will be selected for further scoring based on steric fit within the active site of the ClpQy protease. The selectivity for the parasite enzyme over the human enzyme will be determined by substracting the contact score for parasite enzyme from the contact score for the human enzyme. Selected compounds will be visually screened for protein-ligand, electrostatic, H-bonding and hydrophobic interactions using MACROMODEL 1 . Chemical interactions will be assessed within DOCK 3.5 1 using the force field scoring. Successful compounds will be subjected to biological screening and in vitro assays. Lead protease inhibitors specific against Plasmodium falciparum ClpQy protease at a reasonable nanomolar range will be identified.",

Email: eadebiyi@sdsc.edu Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for about 90% of malaria deaths. Therefore, there is a need to discover new drug targets since the parasite has become resistant to existing malaria drugs. We have established a simple and efficient tool which analyses the metabolic pathways and as well identifies essential reactions/enzymes as possible drug targets in the metabolic network of P. falciparum. We investigated the essentiality of a reaction in the metabolic network of P. falciparum by deleting such a reaction in silico, 30% of the neighbouring compounds of the investigated reaction were chosen as products. We identified 203 essential reactions, our algorithm yield about 40% consensus choke-points as presented elsewhere. Consequently, we did not take essential reactions/enzymes as drug targets into account which have similarity to any human enzyme. Furthermore, our enzymatic reaction data were grouped into six clusters of coexpression of their corresponding genes during the red blood cell life cycle. We effectively identified 19 possible drug targets to be validated experimentally. Our",

Box 30772-00100, Nairobi, Kenya * Corresponding author. Email: cgitau@icipe.orgThe braconid Cotesia sesamiae is the most common endoparasitoid of the cereal stem borers Busseola fusca and Sesamia calamistis in sub-Saharan Africa. In Kenya, two biotypes of C. sesamiae exist. The C. sesamiae population from the western highlands completes development in B. fusca whereas eggs by C. sesamiae from the coastal population get encapsulated and ultimately, no parasitoids emerge from the B. fusca larvae. Both populations successfully complete development in S. calamistis larvae. Results from this study showed that B. fusca larvae parasitised by the avirulent C. sesamiae had frequently more encapsulated eggs at 24 h post parasitism compared to earlier time points. Expression of the C. sesamiae polydnavirus (PDV) CrV1 gene associated with haemocyte inactivation in the Cotesia rubecula/Pieris rapae system was detected in fat body and haemolymph samples from both B. fusca and S. calamistis larvae parasitised by the virulent C. sesamiae from Kitale and Meru regions. There were no or faint amplified CrV1 products on B. fusca fat body and haemolymph samples parasitised by the avirulent C. sesamiae from Mombasa and K itui regions. The difference in expression of CrV1 gene in B. fusca and S. calamistis suggests the involvement of the CrV1 gene in immune suppression and sheds light on the refractoriness of B. fusca towards C. sesamiae biotypes.

In Africa, all known HIV-1 genetic subtypes and groups including groups N and O are present. Whether the various groups, subtypes and recombinant forms of HIV-1 have biological differences with respect to transmissibility and the course of disease progression is not known and most studies have focused on human host immunological responses and not the evolutionary mechanisms of the HIV-1 virus. For this reason it is important to study the phylogenetic distribution of the HIV-1 genetic subtypes in Kenyan cohort of discordant couples with major focus on the HIV-1 seronegative partners who seroconvert during follow-up in prophylactic interventions and establish any epidemiological linkage.",

            "text": "aim is to combine inhibitors in the same cluster group of these possible drug targets additionally improving malaria therapy. Leishmaniases constitute major public health problems in many countries over four continents, and are particularly endemic in Africa and the Mediterranean region. In Tunisia, the epidemiological situation is complex with proven existence of at least three Leishmania species: L. infantum, L. major and L. tropica, which are responsible for cutaneous leishmaniasis. Visceral leishmaniasis is caused by L. infantum. Simple, reliable, sensitive and rapid diagnostic tools still remain a research priority. The aim of this study is to develop diagnostic PCR based assays for the Leishmania species identification and discrimination using targets identified upon the comparative analysis of L. major and L. infantum genomes. We have exploited the genome project databases, available in the public domains: the L. major genome is completed while the L. infantum is still ongoing. We developed perl scripts to Blast sequences from L. infantum against L. major and inversely. The sequences that were identified this way were then blasted on other databases like Genebank and EMBL. Following this selection process, two sequences were identified for L. major and four for L. infantum. The sequences were analysed in silico, they were assigned to six different Leishmania chromosomes (Chr: 8, 21, 23, 30, 32 and 33), and they were annotated using the ''Leishmania bioinformatics toolbox'. Twenty-four primers were designed using the software ''primer 3''. Different primer pairs were considered for each sequence. Their specificity was checked in silico and was assessed experimentally. A total of 18 primer pairs were tested on three DNAs representative of the species L. major, L. infantum and L. tropica. Interestingly, specificity of four sequences was confirmed towards L. infantum (two) or L. major (two). For the remaining two, results are concordant with the latest genome releases. L. tropica DNA was amplified with all primer pairs tested with the exception of two primer pairs corresponding to one L. infantum marker. Three physically independent pairs were selected for the development of a multiplex PCR assay that allows the generation of three consistent and well differentiating amplification profiles, specific for the three Leishmania species encountered in Tunisia, L. major, L. tropica and L. infantum. A DNA array was further developed which allowed a drastic increase in sensitivity of detection and a significant reduction in results delivery time. Work is in progress to evaluate the potential of these tools for molecular diagnosis of Leishmaniasis in Tunisia. This work received financial support from MRSTDC-Tunisia (contrat programme 2004-2008), from the RAB & GH programme of WHO/EMRO-COMSTECH and from AIEA Technical cooperation programme (TUN/06/12).",
