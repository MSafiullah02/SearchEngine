            "text": "The host range and tissue tropism of coronaviruses depend on interactions between the viral S glycoprotein and receptors on susceptible cells (Bosch et al., 2003, Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001). Porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) are swine-specific enteric coronaviruses that are antigenically distinguishable (Lai et al., 2007, Pensaert and Yeo, 2006). However, they replicate in the differentiated enterocytes of the small intestine resulting in similar clinical symptoms including lethal watery diarrhea and dehydration in piglets (Pensaert and Yeo, 2006, Sanchez et al., 1992). Two decades ago, porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) was identified as a cellular receptor for TGEV (Delmas et al., 1992). Since that time, several limited reports have showed that addition of exogenous pAPN facilitates cell infection by PEDV (Li et al., 2007, Oh et al., 2003.). Recent evidence also indicates that increased pAPN receptor density on the surface of ST cells contributes to cell infection by PEDV (Nam and Lee, 2010). The available data supports the hypothesis that blockage of pAPN is a good strategy for preventing cell infection by TGEV or PEDV. Using the pAPN as a target protein, we identified three 12-mer peptides (designated as H, S or F) by phage display which bind to pAPN and competitively inhibit cell infection by TGEV (Ren et al., 2011a).",

Interestingly, although there was no surface expression of pAPN on Vero cells, peptide H decreased the infectivity of PEDV in vitro. Western blots indicated that peptide H (HVTTTFAPPPPR) interacted with the S protein of PEDV. Altering incubation temperatures further demonstrated that peptide H affected pre-attachment of PEDV to cells.

Cell post-treatment assays (\nFig. 1A) were performed to evaluate whether the three peptides were able to inhibit replication of PEDV after infecting Vero cells. Plaque assays indicated that none of the three peptides inhibited PEDV infection; however, rabbit anti-PEDV decreased vial infectivity by more than 50% when the dilutions were reduced from 1:64 to 1:4. When Vero cells were pre-treated with peptide (cell pre-treatment assay) prior to virus infection (Fig. 1B), little changes in virus titers were observed between the control and peptide treatment groups; some small effects were observed with the rabbit anti-PEDV neutralizing antibodies. Finally, in the virus pre-treatment assays where PEDV was incubated with peptides prior to cell infection (Fig. 1C), the results indicated that both peptides H and S inhibited PEDV infectivity where EC50 values were approximately 1 \u03bcg/ml and 62.5 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. The antiviral activity of peptide H was dose-dependent and at 250 \u03bcg/ml it exhibited greater than 95% anti-PEDV activity which is significantly higher than peptides S or F (p<0.01); at 15.6 \u03bcg/ml, inhibition was greater than 70%. The Selectivity indices SI of peptides H and S were 1000 and 16, respectively. Peptide F showed little inhibitory activity against PEDV infection even at concentrations\u22651000 \u03bcg/ml.",

When peptide H and PEDV were co-incubated with Vero cell at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h before shifting to 37 \u00b0C (binding only), this allowed us to measure peptide H effects on early- and pre-attachment of the virus. Results showed that PEDV pre-treated with peptide H exhibited slightly higher inhibition (p>0.05) than when peptide H and PEDV were co-incubated with cells absent a pre-incubation step (Fig. 6B) suggesting that there is a direct effect of peptide H on pre-attachment. Little to no inhibition of infection was observed once the virus became attached to the cell surface.

It is known that pAPN is a cellular receptor for TGEV and that anti-pAPN antibody efficiently decreases cell infection by this virus (Delmas et al., 1992, Liu et al., 2009). Recently, three pAPN-binding peptides H, S, and F were identified using pAPN as an immobilized target for panning a 12-mer phage display peptide library. These peptides exhibited high affinity binding to pAPN and inhibited cell infection by TGEV completely (Ren et al., 2011). As a member of group I coronaviruses, TGEV and PEDV have similar infection characterizations and as such it is difficult to differentiate these pathogens based only upon clinical symptoms. Recent evidence indicates that PEDV may also bind pAPN, a type II glycoprotein, as a functional receptor (Li et al., 2007, Oh et al., 2003). Interestingly, TGEV can be easily propagated in swine-originated cells such as ST cells (Delmas et al., 1992, Hofmann and Wyler, 1988) whereas PEDV is adapted and cultivated in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells rather swine cells. Given the stark similarities as well as differences between TGEV and PEDV, we were interested in evaluating the antiviral effects of the H, S and F peptides on cell infection by PEDV.",

Therefore, we used PrV as an additional control to further confirm and evaluate the inhibition specificity of the H peptide. Peptide H did not prevent infection of pretreated TGEV or PrV suggesting its inhibitory activity was specific and not due to virucidal effects of amphipathic peptides. Clearly, peptide H was able to interact with PEDV; however, it was unclear as to the mechanism of its antiviral activity. As such, the binding characteristics between peptide H (using the phage bearing the H peptide) and PEDV were further examined by Western blot. Results clearly showed that phage H reacted with a protein with a molecular mass of 220 kDa closely approximating the molecular mass of the PEDV S protein. This supposition was corroborated using antibody against the PEDV S protein. In contrast, control phages bearing other peptides did not show such reactivity. These results demonstrate that the peptide H abrogates infectivity in part by binding to the PEDV S protein. This is consistent with the function of the coronavirus S protein that mediates cell infection. Further, cell post-treatment assays evaluating the effects of each peptide on the replication of PEDV in vitro clearly demonstrated that the peptides do not interfere with the intracellular replication of PEDV.",

This corroborated the relationship between the antiviral activity of peptide H and either blockage of the viral attachment or entry into Vero cells. The impact of peptide H on the entry of PEDV was first investigated by performing the cell post-treatment and co-incubation assays. When PEDV was incubated with cells prior to treatment with peptide H no significant effects on PEDV infection were observed. Similar results were seen when peptides, PEDV and the cells were combined at the same time and co-incubated at 37 \u00b0C suggesting that peptide H did not affect PEDV entry into the cell post-adsorption.
