The study of viral pathogenesis thus concerns itself with understanding the process by which a virus produces disease in the host. It is important to recognize that a virus can enter and replicate in a host, and even induce an immunologic response, without producing overt signs or symptoms of disease. For many viruses, the majority of infections, under normal circumstances, are asymptomatic.\nInfection may be of short duration and self-limited (acute) or may be long-term (chronic) or even persist for the life of the host. For many viruses, such as influenza, acute infection is followed by viral clearance and subsequent lifelong immunity against reinfection by the same viral strain. In other cases, exemplified by infection with herpes simplex virus, acute infection is followed by persistence of virus in a noninfectious latent state from which there is periodic reactivation and shedding. A third pattern involves acute infection followed by continuous shedding of virus from infected tissues. By definition, in such cases the host immune response fails to completely clear virus. This may result from strategies which allow viruses to successfully evade host immune responses including restricted expression of viral genes, limitation of infection to immunologically privileged sites, rapid evolution of viral antigenic variants, or virus-induced suppression of or interference with host cellular, humoral, or cytokine-mediated immunological defenses.",

Although the specific steps in this process may differ for individual viruses and particular hosts, the general outline remains true for most cases. A virus must survive in the environment, enter a susceptible host, multiply to increase its inoculum, and spread from the site of entry to target tissues, where it produces disease as the result of infection and injury to particular organs or populations of cells. Finally, virus must be shed into the environment and transmitted to a new susceptible host to begin its life cycle anew. Each of these stages is considered separately.",

The dead keratinized cells of the outer skin layer (stratum corneum) do not support viral replication. Infection can be initiated when a virus enters the host through breeches in skin contiguity such as cuts, abrasions or wounds. Viruses can also be mechanically transported across the stratum corneum by an insect or animal bite or with human-made implements such as hypodermic needles. The layer of the epidermis below the stratum corneum (stratum Malpighii) contains living cells but is essentially devoid of blood vessels, lymphatics and nerves. Viruses that enter this layer, such as the papillomaviruses, typically induce local pathology (e.g. dermal warts), but only rarely disseminate to produce systemic disease. In the case of papillomaviruses, infection occurs initially in basal cells adjacent to the basement membrane separating the overlying epidermis from the deeper dermal layer. Virus maturation parallels keratinocyte differentiation and proceeds as the cells migrate from the deep epidermal layers toward the stratum corneum. Virion assembly occurs predominantly in keratinocytes in the upper spinous layers of the epidermis and mature virions are found in cells in the granular layers and are shed when the stratum corneum is sloughed.",

Despite the absence of local disease many enteric viruses are shed in high titer and for prolonged periods in feces.\nThe target cells for enteric viruses include the mature enterocytes of the intestinal villi and the immature dividing cells in the villus crypts. Some viruses including reoviruses, rotaviruses, picornaviruses, retroviruses, astroviruses and toroviruses can also infect M cells, which are specialized epithelial cells overlying collections of small intestinal lymphoid tissue (Peyer's patches). Although most enteric viruses initiate infection in the small intestine there are exceptions to this rule. For example, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), introduced from infected semen during anal intercourse, may infect dendritic and epithelial cells of the colon and rectum.

Infection of the crypt cells, which develop into absorptive cells, ultimately results in loss of absorptive capacity and leads to diarrhea.\nAnother mechanism of diarrhea production may be through the action of viral proteins that act as secretory toxins. For example, the rotavirus NSP4 protein has toxin-like actions that stimulate enterocyte hypersecretion and subsequent diarrhea. Another important consequence of enterocyte infection is the shedding of large amounts of virus in the stool.\nThis fecal shedding is the predominant source of transmission of many enteric viruses with new cycles of infection being initiated by fecal\u2013oral spread.",

The differing effects of acidity on virions are dramatically illustrated by different species of picornaviruses. For example, rhinoviruses are acid labile and lose infectivity at low pH. Under acidic conditions the viral outer capsid is disrupted, and viral RNA escapes, leaving noninfectious empty capsids. As expected, rhinoviruses do not produce enteric infections. By contrast, other members of the picornavirus family including polio- and coxsackieviruses are resistant to degradation under acidic conditions.

ISVPs appear to play a critical role in the initiation of subsequent intestinal infection (see below). Thus, as a general principle, viruses that produce or initiate infection in the intestinal tract are not inactivated by intestinal proteolytic enzymes. In fact, quite the converse appears to be true, as in many cases proteolytic processing of viral capsid proteins seems to trigger conformational changes in the virus particle or expose new functional determinants on specific proteins which in turn facilitate specific events (receptor binding, membrane fusion, cell entry, transcriptional activation) in the viral life cycle.",

However, a variety of host defenses in addition to antibodies act to clear virus from the bloodstream. The magnitude of viremia is determined by the balance between the entry of virus into the circulation and its subsequent clearance by host defenses. The average time which a viral particle spends in the circulation (\u2018transit time\u2019) is generally less than one hour. Larger virus particles and particles coated with antibody or complement are cleared with far greater efficiency than small nonopsonized particles, and may have transit times of only a few minutes. Additional factors that influence clearance and transit time include the net charge of the virion particle and the composition of the viral capsid or envelope. Host factors may also influence the efficiency of clearance. Experimentally, agents such as thorotrast or silica, which decrease the phagocytic capacity of macrophages and other reticuloendothelial phagocytes, enhance the magnitude and duration of viremia induced by some viruses. Differences in the capacity of macrophages from immature animals to clear virus compared to their adult counterparts may be one mechanism contributing to differences in age-related susceptibility to certain viral infections (e.g. herpes simplex). Macrophages derived from different strains of mice vary in the efficiency with which they clear specific viruses (e.g. mouse hepatitis virus, MHV), and this may explain some strain-specific differences in susceptibility to certain viruses. Finally, recent evidence has suggested that different strains of the same virus may show striking differences in their capacity to replicate in macrophages, and that this in turn may be associated with distinct patterns of organ-specific tropism and virulence.",

For example, certain neurotropic bunyaviruses are fully virulent after direct intracerebral inoculation, but avirulent after peripheral inoculation because they fail to generate sufficient viremia to allow neuroinvasion. It is important to recognize that viremia per se does not automatically equate with the capacity to invade tissues from the bloodstream.

In the case of enveloped viruses, transport appears to involve predominantly the nucleocapsid rather than the enveloped virion. Neurally spreading viruses appear to all utilize the intraneuronal system of microtubule-associated fast axonal transport. This has been established by studying the kinetics of transport and through the use of selective pharmacologic inhibitors of fast and slow axonal transport. The mechanism by which viruses access axoplasmic transport systems and the form in which they are transported (e.g. free or within vesicles), has not yet been established. Taken as a group, neurally spreading viruses provide examples of spread through motor, sensory and autonomic nerve fibers, and in both the anterograde and retrograde direction. In some cases, individual strains of particular viruses (e.g. HSV) may preferentially travel in only one direction. Similarly, studies with reassortant viruses and viral mutants including rabies virus, pseudorabies virus and reovirus suggest that changes in either the viral envelope or capsid proteins, or in some cases in nonstructural proteins (e.g. HSV), may alter the capacity of viruses to spread through nerves, or even through specific neural pathways.",

For example, nonneuroinvasive HSV strains often replicate poorly in peripheral sensory ganglia, suggesting that this, rather than an inability to be neurally transported, accounts for their lack of neuroinvasiveness. These nonneuroinvasive strains remain capable of spreading from the site of inoculation, through nerves, to the sensory ganglia, but their spread is arrested at this stage. Genetic studies of recombinant herpesviruses containing portions of the genome derived from both invasive and nonneuroinvasive viruses indicate that the viral DNA polymerase may determine the capacity of certain viruses to replicate in sensory ganglia and subsequently invade the CNS.",

Some viruses appear to bind distinct receptors through different proteins or using different regions of the same protein.

Virus introduced into the bloodstream through the intracardiac route appeared to preferentially induce paralysis in muscles damaged by the preceding intramuscular inoculation.

Among those frequently cited are the maturation of the immune system, changes in the nature and distribution of populations of mitotically active cells, or on the state of cellular differentiation. Examples of host factors operating at a cellular level include the requirement of retroviruses that host cells undergo mitosis for integration of proviral DNA into their chromosomes.
