Matching of air-and blood flow results from central and local reflexes responding to both internal and external stimuli and subsequently controlling the pumps, as well as the smooth muscle in walls of the airways and blood vessels. A wide range of neural and immune mechanisms protect the lungs against environmental insults, and many are adaptive in nature, resulting in memory that increases sensitivity and responsiveness upon repeated exposure to stimuli. In over 10 % of the population, the responses to environmental stimuli become pathological, resulting in excessive sensitivity and aberrant responses to both specific and nonspecific stimuli, and culminate in physical remodeling of the airways and lungs. Prevention, definitive diagnosis, and effective treatment of the disorders require a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying excessive responses to environmental stimuli.",

Toxins and pathogens in the ambient air can damage the lung tissue, interfere with respiratory mechanics, and limit gas exchange. Both passive and active processes protect the lungs against environmental insults by filtering the inspired air; altering airflow and blood flow to limit alveolar and systemic exposure; capturing, killing, and rapidly clearing pathogens; and efficiently repairing damaged tissues to restore the mucosal barrier. Some of the defense mechanisms are adaptive, increasing the sensitivity of the system and intensity of responses to future insults. Dysregulation of defense pathways can increase sensitivity to nonspecific stimuli and lead to responses that are out of proportion to the insult. This chapter provides a brief overview of the anatomy and physiology of the respiratory tract in relation to development of hypersensitivity and hyperresponsiveness of the respiratory tract.",

The upper airways consist of the extrathoracic structures from the nares and mouth down to, and including, the larynx. Being extrathoracic, these airways are impacted by barometric pressure impinging on their external surface. The lower airways include the extrathoracic and intrathoracic portions of the trachea; the extrapulmonary and intrapulmonary bronchi; and the bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli, which are intrathoracic and intrapulmonary. Intrathoracic extrapulmonary airways are impacted by pressure that develops in the pleural space, which is normally negative, but becomes positive during forced expiration. Intrapulmonary airways are surrounded by alveoli, and their diameter is affected by changes in tension in the lung tissue impinging on their surface, as well as pressure of the alveolar gas, which oscillates from negative to positive during the respiratory cycle. Airways proximal to the respiratory bronchioles lack alveoli and are therefore classified as conducting airways, whereas the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli constitute the gas exchange region of the lungs. With the exception of the pharynx, the walls of the airways become less rigid distally, with the walls of the upper airways containing bone and cartilage, the large lower airways containing cartilage rings or plates, and the small lower airways lacking bone and cartilage.",

            "text": "The nose and mouth represent two parallel pathways by which air enters and leaves the system. The nasal cavity and nasopharynx have a large surface area and tortuous path of airflow that is conducive to filtering, warming, and humidifying ambient air. The nares open into a vestibule, which leads to a constricted region called the nasal valve (Rhee and Kimbell 2012) . Inferior, middle, and superior turbinates posterior to the nasal valve protrude into the airstream from each side of the central septum, increasing the surface area for exchange of heat and moisture. An olfactory region with a high density of olfactory receptors is located high in the nasal cavity. The majority of air passes through the nasal cavity along the floor, between the hard palate and inferior turbinate, and is forced to make a near 90\u00b0 bend in the nasopharynx. Air flowing through the upper regions of the nasal cavity is forced to flow around the turbinates, but enters the nasopharynx at a less acute angle (Kelly et al. 2000) . Both pathways are conducive to removal of large particles by impaction with the airway surface. Airflow through the nose is laminar at velocities up to 200 ml/s, which includes resting conditions; but the velocity is not uniform throughout the nose (Kelly et al. 2000) . The olfactory region has a relatively low airflow velocity, which is presumed to protect the delicate olfactory receptors as well as keep the air in contact with the receptors for a longer period of time, allowing for detection of scents within the airstream (Kelly et al. 2000) . At flow rates greater than 200 ml/s, turbulence develops, which increases resistance and work of breathing. The nasal cavity has fairly rigid walls, and the main factors that impact resistance to airflow in this region are physical obstructions such as polyps and septal deviation, swelling of the mucosa, and accumulation of secretions in the airway lumen.",

The nasopharynx passes over the soft palate before opening into the oropharynx. Right and left Eustachian tubes open into the nasopharynx and connect the middle ear with the upper airway. In contrast to the nasal cavity, the pharynx in humans is deformable. The hyoid bone and soft tissue comprising the airway wall in this region are not directly attached to the surrounding skeletal structures, making the wall of the pharynx deformable (Dempsey et al. 2010; Susarla et al. 2010) . In humans, there is a relatively large distance between the soft palate and epiglottis, and the face is flattened, resulting in a long, narrow oropharynx upon which the tongue encroaches. Another unique feature is that adipose tissue accumulates in the surrounding tissue and can apply pressure to the outside of the airway, affecting lumen diameter. As discussed later, all of these factors predispose the pharynx to collapsing late in expiration and during inspiration. The tendency to collapse is offset by two factors, neural reflexes that activate pharyngeal muscles and stiffen the wall, and by traction developed in the pharyngeal wall as the lung inflates (Dempsey et al. 2010; Susarla et al. 2010) .",

The trachea extends from the larynx in the cervical region to the carina in the thoracic cavity. Like the larynx, the carina is sensitive to tactile stimulation, which evokes cough. The wall of the trachea is supported by 15-20 C-shaped rings of cartilage interspersed with soft tissue. The posterior membrane connecting the ends of cartilaginous rings contains smooth muscle that can shorten the distance between the ends of the cartilage, decreasing the diameter of the trachea. Smooth muscle is also located between the cartilaginous rings allowing at least a small degree of active regulation of tracheal length. Shortening of the trachea can reduce resistance to airflow by both decreasing the length of the airway and increasing traction on the pharynx, stiffening the wall and opposing collapse.",

The diameter of each airway decreases; but the aggregate, or total cross-sectional diameter of the airspace increases distally, which has two prominent functional impacts. First, the velocity of airflow diminishes, decreasing turbulence. Second, total resistance to airflow decreases exponentially with the increase in the effective/aggregate radius of the airways. Only about 2 % of the total airway resistance is accounted for by the bronchioles and alveolar ducts; and likewise only a small decrease in lumen pressure occurs along normal distal airways during exhalation. The relatively small pressure drop along the intrapulmonary airways minimizes the tendency for dynamic compression of the airways induced by the differential between a positive alveolar pressure surrounding the airways and reduced luminal pressure due the resistive drop during exhalation. Partial obstruction of distal airways due to contraction of smooth muscle or accumulation of secretions in the airway lumen leads to increased resistance and a greater-than-normal decrease in luminal pressure, predisposing the airways to close earlier than normal during exhalation.",

The pressure developed by surface tension promotes the transfer of air from alveoli with small radii into larger alveoli, which can result in collapse of small alveoli and development of atelectasis if surface tension is too great. Surface tension also induces a pressure differential between fluid in the interstitial compartment and the airway surface, which acts to pull water out of capillaries and the alveolar wall and into the airspace, leading to alveolar edema.",

During lung inflation, surfactant apoproteins B and C (SP-B and SP-C) facilitate the insertion of the lipid into the interfacial film to maintain a relatively uniform concentration of the surface-active material at the interface.

SP-A has some ability to facilitate formation of tubular myelin and adsorption of surfactant on the alveolar surface, but also enhances killing, aggregation, and phagocytosis of microorganisms (Orgeig et al. 2010) . The antimicrobial activity of SP-A is a result of direct opsonization of pathogens, as well as upregulation of pattern recognition receptors on phagocytes that mediate uptake and elimination of the foreign bodies. SP-D has similar functional properties to SP-A, but in addition, modulates macrophage, dendritic cell, and T-cell functions (Orgeig et al. 2010; Forbes and Haczku 2010) . Deficiency in SP-D leads to increased numbers of myeloid dendritic cells in the lungs that promote Th2 responses. Treatment with recombinant SP-D can reduce allergen-induced eosinophilic inflammation and antigen-specific IgE production (Orgeig et al. 2010) .",

The nasal mucosa is perfused by the sphenopalatine branches of the maxillary artery, the anterior and posterior ethmoidal branches of the ophthalmic artery, and the superior labial artery, a branch of the facial artery (Osborn 1978) . The larynx is perfused by the superior and inferior branches of the laryngeal artery, which stem from superior and inferior thyroid arteries, and run to the larynx alongside the superior and inferior laryngeal nerves (Weir 1997) . Blood flow to the trachea is via the inferior thyroid, supreme intercostal, subclavian, internal mammary, innominate, and bronchial arteries. The branching from these arteries connects with one another to form longitudinal tracheal anastomoses that give rise to intercartilaginous submucosal capillary plexuses (Salassa et al. 1977) . The bronchial circulation provides oxygenated blood to the bronchi and walls of the intrapulmonary airways, and the pulmonary circulation delivers mixed venous blood to the alveolar capillaries for gas exchange. An extensive lymphatic system drains the lungs and thoracic cavity (Gray 2000; Carati and Gannon 2006) . The lymph vessels are divided into parietal and visceral components. Plexuses of parietal lymphatic vessels drain into sternal, intercostals, diaphragmatic, and axillary nodes. The visceral lymph nodes are located along the mediastinum in associated with the esophagus, large veins and arteries, and pericardium and along the trachea and bronchi. Drainage of the lungs is via two plexuses: superficial and deep. The superficial plexus is located beneath the visceral pleura and drains to nodes at the hilus. The deep plexus consists of vessels surrounding airways and blood vessels. In the bronchioles, there is a single plexus, but in the bronchi there are two plexuses, submucosal and peribronchial. The deep plexus drains into tracheobronchial nodes. The lymphatic vessels terminate at the alveolar ducts, and fluid from the alveolar wall moves to the vessels in response to the \"pumping\" action of respiration.",

Postganglionic fibers originate in plexuses within the airway wall associated with mucosa, submucosa, smooth muscle, peri-tracheal, and peribronchial layers (Wine 2007) . Afferent fibers exiting the lungs travel through the vagus nerve to the nodose and intracranial jugular ganglia, which in turn have outputs to the nucleus tractus solitarius. Afferent neurons include myelinated A\u03b4 and nonmyelinated C fibers. A\u03b4 fibers exhibit an organized pattern of terminals with attachments to the mucosal extracellular matrix making them responsive to mechanical deformation of the airway wall (Canning 2011) . The A\u03b4 mechanosensitive fibers can be separated into slowly adapting (SAR) and rapidly adapting (RAR) functional phenotypes, with SARs being associated with regulatory inflation and deflation reflexes (e.g., Hering-Breuer); and RARs being polymodal and associated with defensive reflexes such as cough and sneeze (Widdicombe 1982) . Lung afferent C-fibers are small, nonmyelinated fibers that terminate in the airway wall, vasculature, and parenchyma. Similar to nociceptors in other tissues, these fibers are polymodal and are typically classified as chemoreceptors (Lee and Pisarri 2001) . C fibers in the lungs are classified into two groups, bronchial and pulmonary, based on the circulation that perfuses the tissues they innervate.",

One mechanism by which this occurs is antidromic conduction of action potential in branches of afferent nerve fibers. Action potentials generated at sensory nerve terminals in the airway mucosa can be conducted along branches of the afferent neuron leading to the surface epithelium, glands, and blood vessels within the airway wall. Release of neurotransmitters, particularly NANC transmitters, results in intrinsic control of airway functions, initiating responses or modulating centrally mediated responses. Axon reflexes are common in the airways of rats and guinea pigs, but their overall importance in humans is a matter of debate. While direct empirical evidence of the importance of intrinsic control of airway tone and secretory activity is lacking, the fact that airways in transplanted lungs can function relatively normally for years without external innervations argues in favor of some intrinsic mechanism for maintaining airway patency and protecting the airways from environmental insult (Wine 2007) (Fig. 2. 2).",

TRP channels are express on numerous cell types within the airway wall, including neurons ( Fig. 2. 3). TRP channels were first described in relation to phospholipase C (PLC)dependent phototransduction in Drosophila (Hardie and Minke 1995) , and later as a family of mammalian proteins involved in capacitative calcium entry induced by diverse stimuli via PLC-dependent and -independent mechanisms Zhu et al. 1996) . In 2001, TRPs were implicated in hypoxic vasoconstriction (McDaniel et al. 2001; 2002) , bronchoconstriction, and bronchial smooth muscle proliferation (Sweeney et al. 2002) ; and by 2003 were recognized as potential targets in diverse environmental and inflammatory lung diseases (Li et al. 2003) .

Activation of TRP can lead to depolarization due to enhanced cation conductance, elevation of intracellular Ca 2+ concentration, or hyperpolarization when the channels are co-expressed with BKCa K + channels (Moran et al. 2011; Kim et al. 2009 ). TRPs are expressed by many of the major cell types involved in asthma and COPD, and data indicate that TRP channels are involved in osmotic sensing, modulation of vascular permeability, mucociliary clearance, and inflammation (Colsoul et al. 2009 ). In most cases, in vivo studies confirming physiological and pathophysiological roles for these receptors are lacking, but in the case of TRPA1, TRPC6, TRPV1, TRPV4, and TRPM4 in vivo validation is emerging (Banner et al. 2011 ). TRPA1 is activated by diverse chemical stimuli, including changes in pH, and cold. TRPV1 is activated by heat, acid, and high chemical stimuli, but at higher concentrations than those known to activate TRPA1. TRPC6 is expressed in vascular smooth muscle and endothelium, and its activity is affected by mechanical stimuli, including stretch. TRPC6 has been linked to hypoxic vasoconstriction in pulmonary vasculature (Weissmann et al. 2006 ) and plays a role in formation of pulmonary edema following pulmonary ischemia and reperfusion, as well as podocyte formation in kidney cells ). TRPV4 has also been linked to changes in vascular permeability and formation of pulmonary edema induced by high vascular pressure, airway inflation pressures, and tidal volumes (Banner et al. 2011) .",

In contrast, defensive reflexes respond to environmental stimuli to protect cardiopulmonary function. Composition, or quality, of the air is monitored; and ventilation, perfusion, and mucosal functions are modulated to minimize exposure of tissues to injurious, or detrimental factors.

The basic reflexes linking changes in O 2 , CO 2 , and pH to ventilation are described in textbooks of physiology and will not be reiterated here; but changes in sensitivity to CO 2 in relation to respiratory drive and sleep apnea and reflex control of the airways by O 2 and CO 2 deserve consideration. Under normal conditions, hypercapnia and hypoxia are primary stimuli of the respiratory central pattern generator (CPG) in the brainstem. During sleep in normal individuals, the sensitivity to CO 2 decreases, resulting in an elevation of P aCO 2 by 3-6 mmHg (Dempsey et al. 2010; Skatrud and Dempsey 1983) . In parallel, the apnea threshold, or the P aCO 2 below which an individual will be apneic, increases in parallel and remains 4-5 mmHg lower than the steady state P aCO 2 . Normal individuals retain sensitivity to small changes in CO 2 during sleep and respond with changes in ventilation that maintain P aCO 2 within a narrow range and above the apnea threshold (Naughton 2010 ). So, P aCO 2 remains high but stable. In contrast, patients with sleep apnea do not exhibit elevated P aCO 2 during sleep or a reduction in the apnea threshold, resulting in a smaller difference between the steady state P aCO 2 during sleep and apnea threshold (Naughton 2010; Xie et al. 2002) . Thus, small decreases in P aCO 2 lead to apnea and unstable breathing.",

Reflexes exist to both preempt and respond to collapse of the upper airways. Reflexes that preempt closure of the upper airways originate in the CPG. Many of the muscles of the upper airways receive input from the CPG, which synchronizes their activity with inspiration and expiration and modifies their activity in response to respiratory stimulants and depressants, such as hypoxia, hypercapnia, and opiates. The genioglossus is the upper airway muscle that is best studied in this regard. The genioglossus contracts 50-100 ms before the beginning of inspiration, pulling the tongue forward and down, away from the pharynx, presumably in preparation for the development of negative airway pressure that would act to pull the tongue back into the oropharynx (Edwards and White 2011) .",

The effect of mechanical deformation is observed both within and across regions of the airways. The processes have been defined best in the lower airways, but are also known to be present in the upper airways. Both the active development of compressing transmural pressure during inspiration and passive compression by surrounding tissues tends to collapse the oropharynx. Collapse of the pharyngeal wall is opposed by active and passive forces (Susarla et al. 2010) . Negative pressure that develops in the pharynx during inspiration activates mechanoreceptors in the pharyngeal wall, inducing reflex contraction of constrictor muscles that stabilize the wall and oppose collapse. Simultaneously, expansion of the lungs increases traction on the upper airways, stiffening and opposing collapse of the pharynx. Conversely, positive pressure developed during exhalation induces activation of pharyngeal dilator muscles. Simultaneously, loss of traction on the pharynx as the lung deflates leads to progressive loss of tension in the pharyngeal wall during exhalation. The combination of a high level of pharyngeal dilator activity and compression by fat deposits in the wall of the pharynx has been implicated in collapse of the oropharynx late in expiration in obstructive sleep apnea (Susarla et al. 2010) .",

Each of these responses can be induced locally, but there is clear evidence of reflex involvement in sneezing, nasal secretion, and congestion (Sarin et al. 2006) . Sneezing is induced by irritants or tactile stimulation of the nasal mucosa, but also by exposure of the eyes to bright light or exposure of areas of the skin to sudden changes in temperature will induce sneezing. Rhinorrhea, or excessive nasal secretions, can be induced by local exposure to histamine, allergens, cold air, hypertonic solutions, the TRPV1 activator capsaicin, or bradykinin; but it can also be induced in the contralateral nostril (Sarin et al. 2006) . The reflex nature of the response is evident from the fact that the contralateral response is eliminated by cutting the Vidian nerve. Nasal congestion occurs in response to vasodilation of mucosal blood vessels and pooling of blood in the mucosa. Congestion can be induced by exposure of skin at different sites on the body to changes in temperature. The reflex nature of congestion is further indicated by the observation that congestion can cycle from one nostril to the other (Sarin et al. 2006 ). This nasal cycle can be disrupted by inhibition of either sympathetic or parasympathetic outflow, leading to the idea that the cycling results from oscillating imbalance in parasympathetic-mediated vasodilation and sympathetic-mediated vasoconstriction.",

In contrast to cough initiated by C-fibers, cough associated with A\u03b4 fibers is rarely paroxysmal and is observed under anesthesia. Over 60 years ago, JG Widdicombe described vagal afferent fibers that were insensitive to mechanical stimulation of the airway surface, adapted rapidly to lung inflation, and could induce cough (Widdicombe 1954a, b) . This initial description has led to the idea that RAR fibers are cough receptors, but Canning cautions against this interpretation (Canning 2010 (Canning , 2011 . A\u03b4 fibers are not a homogenous population, but rather there are multiple subpopulations that differ in peripheral termination sites, sensitivity to mechanical stimuli, and reflexes they activate. In some cases, activation of RAR fibers and cough can be dissociated, indicating that the cough receptor that activate A\u03b4 fibers are separate entities from RARs. Specifically, stimuli that activate RAR fibers-hyperventilation, breathing against a closed glottis, and bronchoconstriction induced by histamine, neurokinin A, and leukotrienes-do not elicit cough (Canning 2010) . The cough receptors do not express the capsaicin receptor, TRPV1, but respond to protons and therefore may express other acid-sensitive ion channels. More definitive identification of cough receptors has been elusive, possibly due to plasticity in the pathway. Undem and colleagues have demonstrated that aeroallergen challenge induces TRPV1 expression in A\u03b4 fibers (Lieu et al. 2012 ). The aeroallergen-induced change in phenotype increases the range of stimuli that lead to neural activation.",

The diving reflex stimulated by exposure of the face and nasal mucosa to cold water is a wellrecognized example of a cardiopulmonary reflex originating in the face and upper airways. The apnea and bradycardia induced by immersion in cold water can be so intense as to be fatal. The diving reflex is inhibited by interrupting conduction in the trigeminal nerve and can be mimicked by stimulating the ophthalmic branch (V 1 ) of the trigeminal nerve. The systemic vascular responses to immersion in cold water is species dependent, but in humans exposing the nose to cold water leads to peripheral vasoconstriction and peripheral hypertension, but retention of coronary and cerebral blood flow. The diving reflex also entails closure of the larynx, reducing the risk of aspirating water.",

            "text": "Airborne particles are removed from inspired air by the impaction, interception, sedimentation, and diffusion. Impaction is the process by which inertia causes the particle to collide with the wall of the airway where the airstream deviates from a straight path. Particles with diameters greater than 10 \u03bcm (e.g., pollens, coarse particulate from mining and grinding activities) are deposit largely in the upper airways due to inertial impaction. Deflection of the inspired air around the turbinates and through the bend in the nasopharynx causes large particles with high inertia to impact with the front edge of the turbinates and posterior wall of the nasopharynx. The degree of impaction is related to the velocity of airflow, and as airflow rates decrease more large particles escape the upper airways and enter the lower airways, depositing in the trachea-bronchial region (Nakorn Tippayawong and Det Damrongsak 2003; Heyder 2004) . Large particles escaping the upper airways continue to impact the airway wall at branch points/bifurcations in the lower airways. Interception is a term use to describe deposition resulting from a particle brushing against the wall of the airway and being trapped in the mucus, airway surface liquid, glycocalyx, or cell membranes. Fibers have a particularly high probability of being intercepted by the airways wall. Sedimentation refers to the settling of particles out of the airstream as velocity of airflow decreases. High rates of sedimentation are observed in the distal bronchi and bronchioles, where airflow velocity decreases due to an exponential increase in cross-sectional diameter of the airways. Particles that escape impaction, interception, and sedimentation can come in contact with and deposit on the airway wall via diffusion. Particles with aerodynamic diameters less than 10 \u03bcm (e.g., particles from combustion) are carried in the airstream to the lower airways and are considered to be respirable; and particles less than approximately 1 \u03bcm are carried into the alveoli; but the composition and surface characteristics of the particles greatly affect their deposition pattern. Hydrophilic particles tend to increase in size as inspired air is humidified, resulting in greater rates of deposition than predicted on their original dimensions (Heyder 2004) . Likewise, aggregation of dispersed particles increases deposition within the lungs and consolidation of particles within the airways. Hydrophobic particles exhibit less deposition in the larger airways than expected based on aerodynamic diameter, but greater deposition in distal regions where the hydrophobicity of alveolar surfactant can facilitate their interaction with the airway surface (Heyder 2004 ).",

CFTR activity is regulated by cAMP, and the importance of this pathway in electrolyte balance is highlighted by the airway dehydration associated with cystic fibrosis. ATP may also play a role in regulating the depth of the periciliary and mucus layers. ATP is released by the epithelium into the airway lumen and acts through P2Y receptors to stimulate airway epithelial Cl \u2212 secretion via CaCC and inhibit airway epithelial Na + absorption via ENaC (Tarran et al. 2006 ). Breakdown of ATP to adenosine and subsequent activation of A2b receptors on the apical epithelial surface can regulate CFTR and ENaC secondarily (Tarran et al. 2006) . ATP also stimulates surfactant release from Type II pneumocytes and thereby reduces surface tension (Mishra et al. 2011 ).

The configuration of the respiratory system leads to region-specific closure of airways during inspiration and expiration. Respiratory muscles act on the chest wall and diaphragm to change the pressure in the pleural space and alveoli, which subsequently drive airflow. The nose accounts for approximately 50 % of the total resistance to airflow through the respiratory system during nasal breathing. The nasal resistance lowers the pressure in the pharynx during inspiration, predisposing the pharynx to collapse during inspiration (Ferris et al. 1964) . In contrast, the restriction opposes collapse of the distal airways during exhalation by providing a backpressure in the airway lumen. By comparison, the intrathoracic extrapulmonary airways are surrounded by pleural pressure, which remains negative relative to barometric pressure during quiet breathing. Thus, during normal resting breathing, pleural pressure opposes closure of intrathoracic airways during inspiration. During forced exhalation, pleural pressure can be positive, which tends to compress the intrathoracic extrapulmonary airways. Likewise, intrapulmonary airways are surrounded by alveoli, and development of positive alveolar pressure during exhalation acts as a compressive force. Under normal conditions, the resistance of the distal airways is low, leading to minimal decrease in the luminal pressure, minimizing the pressure differential across the wall of the intrapulmonary airways. Alveolar septa impinge upon the walls of the intrapulmonary airways, and stretch of the septa opposes collapse of the airways, particularly at high lung volumes. Increase in the resistance of the distal airways due to smooth muscle contraction, accumulation of secretions in the airway lumen, or destruction of lung tissue that reduces elastic recoil leads a premature drop in the luminal pressure and dynamic compression of the airways during exhalation (Irvin and Bates 2009 ).",

While there is abundant expression of VIP in the trachea and bronchi Kraneveld and Nijkamp 2001; Groneberg et al. 2001) , there is a lack of definitive evidence for expression of the known VIP receptors-PAC, VPAC1, and VPAC2-on airway smooth muscle, yet VPAC2 agonists induce bronchodilation both in vivo and in vitro (Tannu et al. 2010) .

In human mast cells, SP can down-regulate Fc\u03b5RI and the response to IgE (McCary et al. 2010) . In vivo, down-regulation of Fc\u03b5RI would reduce acute bronchoconstriction in response to allergen, which would be in opposition to bronchoconstriction induced by direct effect of SP binding to NK2 receptors airway smooth muscle. Reciprocally, mast cell lines have been shown to express NK1 and NK2 receptors, and SP modulates mast cell activity (Kraneveld and Nijkamp 2001) . Similarly, both nerves and mast cells have been shown to secrete and respond to nerve growth factor (NGF) (Kraneveld and Nijkamp 2001) . Cholinergic, adrenergic, and nonadrenergic noncholinergic neurotransmitters regulate secretions in the airways. Adrenergic stimulation induces electrolyte secretion onto the airway surface.

PRRs recognize PAMPs including mannans in the yeast cell wall, bacterial-derived formylated peptides, lipopolysaccharides, and lipoteichoic acids; and PRR-PAMP interaction be direct or may depend on intermediate or adapter molecules. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) bind PAMPs directly. TLR2 and 4 are expressed by alveolar macrophages and mediate many of the responses to pathogens . TLRs also recognize damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), leading macrophages to respond to tissue injury following environmental exposures and inflammatory responses ).

Dendritic cells play a central role in both initiating immune responses to allergens, microbes, and viruses and maintaining balance within the immune system. Accordingly, different subsets have specialized, and occasionally opposing effects on immune responses. For example, dendritic cells of myeloid origin, including conventional and inflammatory dendritic cells, actively promote T H 1 and T H 2 immune responses against foreign antigens (Hammad and Lambrecht 2011; Hammad et al. 2010) .

Immature dendritic cells are thereby poised to take up and process antigens, but are inefficient in presenting antigen to lymphocytes. In the presence of inflammatory mediators including GM-CSF, IL-4, CD40L, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), DAMPs, PAMPs, or specific ligation with T-helper cells, immature dendritic cells differentiate and express high levels of MHCII and the accessory molecules necessary for efficient antigen presentation. Exposure to antigen and inflammatory mediators, which normally occurs in peripheral tissues, causes the dendritic cell to migrate to the draining lymph nodes where the mature dendritic cell then presents antigens with high efficiency in the T cell zones of the secondary lymphoid tissues. Maturation factors for dendritic cells are prevalent in the mucosa in many diseases, particularly in allergic airways disease, and result in recruitment of monocytes that differentiate into mature dendritic cells (Ganesh et al. 2009; Blanchfield and Mannie 2010; Hamilton and Anderson 2004; Ritz et al. 2002; Soruri and Zwirner 2005) .",

In contrast, soluble peptide allergens induce dendritic cells, particularly myeloid dendritic cells, to mature into a T H 2promoting phenotype thought to play a critical role in allergic respiratory diseases (Tsoumakidou et al. 2008) . Interestingly, viral infections are a primary trigger for asthmatic reactions, so the dichotomy between the effects of viral and allergenic antigens is not absolute. Viral exposure has been shown to induce the expression of the high affinity IgE receptor (Fc\u03b5RI) on murine dendritic cells, and activation of the receptor leads to expression of CCL28, a chemoattractant for T and B lymphocytes (Holtzman et al. 2009; Grayson et al. 2007) .",

T H cells are further divided into effector and memory T H 1, T H 2, T H 9, and T H 17 cells. T H 1 cells secrete IFN-\u03b3 and promote cellular immunity. T H 2 cells secrete IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, and IL-13 that support humoral immune responses. IL-4 is a key cytokine in needed for differentiation of the T H 2 subset and immunoglobulin class switching to the IgE isotype. IL-5 is a primary growth factor for eosinophils, and IL-13 induces smooth muscle and goblet cell growth. IL-6 is a growth factor for T, B, and mast cells. IL-9 also promotes mast cell growth. IL-10 promotes B cell growth, but inhibits T H 1 and T H 2 responses. T H 17 cells secrete IL-17A and F, which promote neutrophilic inflammation. iNKT cells can be activated by glycolipid bound to the MHC-class-I-like cell surface protein, CD1d, leading to secretion of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 and T H 2-like inflammation (Meyer et al. 2008; Iwamura and Nakayama 2010) . iNKT cells are responsive to IL-25 and IL-33, which are expressed by epithelial cells in response to activation of PRRs. iNKT cells may thereby act as effector cells for epithelial cell-initiated responses to diverse environmental stimuli, helping to explain the preponderance of the Th2 response in the allergic lungs. IL-25 is also secreted by mast cells and T H 2 lymphocytes. This reciprocal activation of iNKT, mast cells, and T H 2 lymphocytes represents a point of synergism between the adaptive and innate immune systems (Iwamura and Nakayama 2010) . iNKT cells are relatively resistant to corticosteroids and may contribute to steroidresistance in asthma. \u03b3\u03b4 T cells also respond to lipid antigens presented in the context of CD1d on the surface of DCs (Lloyd and Hessel 2010) . Some \u03b3\u03b4 T cells can express cytokines associated with asthma, including IL-5 and IL-13 (Robinson 2010) and IL-17A (Murdoch and Lloyd 2010) .

PMNs are also prominent following acute lung injury and in the lungs of subjects who die of status asthmaticus (Deniz et al. 2002) . In COPD, PMN numbers correlate with impairment of pulmonary function (Cowburn et al. 2008; Perl et al. 2011) . PMNs are activated and recruited to the lungs by diverse signals, including IL-8 acting on the CXCR1 and CXCR2 chemokine receptors and leukotriene-B4 (LTB4), TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and MCP-1 (Bathoorn et al. 2008) . Circulating PMN binds to pulmonary capillary endothelial cells via selectins (P-, E-, and L-selectin) and \u03b22-integrins. The majority of transendothelial migration of neutrophils is via active endothelial engulfment triggered by engagement of ICAM1 (Perl et al. 2011; Bathoorn et al. 2008 ). In the tissues, PMNs migrate to the site of inflammation by phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent chemotaxis. Circulating PMNs have a relatively short lifespan (6-12 h), but apoptosis can be inhibited and lifespan extended at sites of inflammation by lipid activators, TNF, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, GM-CSF, G-CSF, and hypoxia; thereby extending their longevity in the tissues (Cowburn et al. 2008; van Buul et al. 2007) . Activated neutrophils secrete elastase, cathepsins, myeloperoxidase, and ROS; all of which can lead to further tissue damage. Macrophages play a role in down-regulating neutrophilic inflammation by phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils and secretion IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 (Perl et al. 2011) . Impairment of macrophages in COPD may contribute to chronic neutrophilic inflammation.",

Whether eosinophils are bystanders or effectors in these diseases is a matter of debate (Saha and Brightling 2006) . IL-5 is a primary eosinophil growth factor, and complement C5a and platelet activating factor are major chemoattractants (Akuthota et al. 2011; Sugita et al. 2003) . Other cytokines that are active in eosinophil recruitment include IL-2, IL-3, GM-CSF, eotaxin, and RANTES (Resnick and Weller 1993) . Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) is upregulated on endothelial cells by IL-4t does not efficiently interact with neutrophils, which may be why eosinophils accumulate in allergic airways to a greater degree than neutrophils (Resnick and Weller 1993) . When activated, eosinophils release cationic proteins, leukotrienes, and ROS (Resnick and Weller 1993) . In addition, eosinophils contain over 30 different cytokines that are released in response to specific stimulation (Sugita et al. 2003; Spencer et al. 2009 ).

The mechanisms underlying recruitment of mast cell precursors to the lungs have not been fully defined but appear to involve interactions of integrins \u03b14\u03b21 and \u03b14\u03b27 with VCAM-1 in response to LTB4, PGE 2 , IL-9, and other signals from NKT and T reg cells (Akuthota et al. 2011 ). In the mucosa, mast cells mature in response to stem cell factor (SCF) produced by the epithelium Weller et al. 2011) , acting through the c-kit receptor (Wen et al. 1996) . When mature, mast cells respond to PAMPs, DAMPs, environmental stimuli, and allergen-specific IgE by immediate release of preformed mediators, including histamine, serotonin, and serine proteases, followed by synthesis and release of cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4, D4, E4, and F4), LTB4, thromboxane, and platelet activating factor. Mast cells also release pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-\u03b1, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-13, which augment and prolong mucosal inflammation .",

The epithelium expresses a wide array of receptors to monitor inspired air for pathogens and toxins, including protease-activated receptors (PARs), TLRs, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain [NOD]-like receptors, and TRPs. Activation leads to release of cytotoxic proteins, collectins, and ROS that contribute to killing and clearance of microbes (Brown et al. 2007; Shannahan et al. 2012) . Epithelial cells modulate immune responses through release of cytokines that act on dendritic cells and T cells. For example, GM-CSF and TSLP induce dendritic cells to promote T H 2 immune responses. IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 promote T H 1 responses, and IFN-\u03bb (IL-28 and IL-29) promotes T reg growth (Schleimer et al. 2007 ). IL-33 production by epithelial cells promotes mast cell activation and T H 2 cell differentiation, and IL-25 activates iNKT cells to produce T H 2 cytokines. Recent studies by McKenzie indicate that IL-25 also induces nuocytes that produce T H 2 cytokines (Schleimer et al. 2007 ). IL-6 production results in the differentiation of antibody-secreting B cells. Ligation of CD40 on epithelial cells can initiate inflammatory cell recruitment via release of RANTES, MCP, CCL28, and IL-8. Epithelial cells can also regulate survival of immune cells via expression of PD-L1, PD-L2, and Fas ligand (Barlow and McKenzie 2011; Neill et al. 2010) .",

The epithelium may play an even more direct role in fibrosis via epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT is a form of epithelial plasticity in which epithelial cells redifferentiate into migratory fibroblastoid cells. It is well recognized that epithelial damage leads to release of TGF-\u03b2, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) that facilitate wound healing and promote fibrosis. TGF-\u03b2 down-regulates E-cadherin and tight junctions between the epithelial cells and upregulates mesenchymal markers (Hackett. 2012) .

Detailed discussion of these mechanisms is beyond the scope of this chapter, but a few examples are noteworthy because they portray a general paradigm. Similar to traditional negative feedback loops in the endocrine system, some mediators released during immune activation act on inhibitory receptors to restrict further cellular activation. Notable examples are nitric oxide, prostaglandins, and catabolites of tryptophan. Prostaglandins produced by the cyclooxygenase pathway interact with heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors to stimulate adenylate cyclase formation of cAMP. Nitric oxide produced by nitric oxide synthetase acts through guanylate cyclase to increase cGMP, which in certain cases inhibits immune and inflammatory processes (Bosnjak et al. 2011; Saxon et al. 2008; Cook and Bochner 2010; Bjorgo et al. 2011; Bopp et al. 2009; Baumer et al. 2007; Heijink and Van Oosterhout 2006; Mitkiewicz et al. 2011) . Similarly, activation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and subsequent release of tryptophan metabolites can stimulate aryl hydrocarbon receptors that promote tolerance to aeroallergens (Taher et al. 2008) . Inhibitory Fc receptors that bind the Fc domain of IgG, such as Fc\u03b3RIIB, are expressed on B cells and mast cells, and when activated reduce cellular activation and cytokine production (Taher et al. 2008) . Upregulation and activation of decoy cytokine receptors, such as IL-13R \u03b12, can have potent inhibitory and negative feedback consequences, thereby opposing the inflammatory activity of cytokines (Saxon et al. 2008; Karra and Levi-Schaffer 2011; Smith and Clatworthy 2010; Zhu et al. 2010) .",

CTLA-4 is expressed on the surface of activated T cells and inhibits CD28 binding to B7 on antigen presenting cells. Expression of CTLA4 limits costimulation required for T-cell activation (Mentink-Kane and Wynn 2004). PD-1 acts in a similar fashion. PD-1 is expressed on activated T and B cells, and one of its ligands, PDL-2 is expressed on myeloid dendritic cells and macrophages. Expression of PD-1 provides negative feedback to further activation of T and B cells (Chen and Shi 2006; Bour-Jordan et al. 2011) . CD22 and CD72 are co-inhibitory receptors on B cells. Their ligands are expressed on diverse cell types, but when activated simultaneously the B cell is inhibited. Similarly, CD200R is expressed on dendritic cells and macrophages, and CD200 is more widely expressed on epithelium, T cells, and B cells (Chen and Shi 2006; Singh et al. 2011; Okazaki and Honjo 2006) . CD200 interaction with CD200R is thought to maintain balance in the lungs between protection and immunopathology (Minas and Liversidge 2006; Gorczynski 2005; Barclay et al. 2002) .",

TGF-\u03b2 is a strong stimulating factor for epithelial cell differentiation and fibroblast secretion of extracellular matrix proteins, contributing to the airway remodeling observed in chronic pulmonary allergic disease pathology. TGF-\u03b2 can be pro-inflammatory when acting in concert with cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-23, or IL-4 by augmenting differentiation of T H 17 and T H 2 cells. TGF-\u03b2 has pronounced antiinflammatory activity by inhibiting IgE production, mast cell proliferation, T cell, B cell, NK cell, and cytotoxic lymphocyte function (Commins et al. 2010; Chung and Barnes 1999) or anti-inflammatory role by inhibiting IgE production, mast cell proliferation, T cell, B cell, NK cell, and cytotoxic lymphocyte functions (Chung and Barnes 1999) . TGF-\u03b2 is a primary cytokine responsible for the differentiation of CD4+ CD25+ T regulatory lymphocytes (T reg cells) that release the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Reduction in the numbers of T reg cells in hypersensitivity disorders may allow activation of APC and effector cells to promote inflammation. However, the role of T reg cells in pulmonary inflammation may be more complicated because some subsets of T reg cells, particularly the inducible iT reg subset exhibits a high level of plasticity, and can transform into IL-17 and IFN-\u03b3 producing effector cells to drive inflammation (Akdis and Akdis 2009 ). Thus, whether T reg cells act to promote or attenuate inflammation could depend on the local environment.",

In rhesus macaques, postnatal exposure to house dust mite and ozone reduced neural projections to the epithelium and increased lateral projections to the basal lamina (Dunnill et al. 1969) . One year after exposure, nerve density in the airway wall was increased, and projections to the epithelium were abnormal (Larsen et al. 2012; Larson et al. 2004 ). In rodents, allergic aeroallergens and irritants such as ozone stimulate release of neurotrophins, such as NGF, that promote neural growth within the airway mucosa (Kajekar et al. 2007 ). Ovalbumin sensitization induces TRPV1 expression in airway A\u03b4 afferent fibers in guinea pigs, which could increase the diversity of stimuli that activate these fibers and lead to cough in allergic asthma (Joos et al. 2000; Ito et al. 2008; Hunter et al. 2011) . Another indication of altered neural activity in allergic asthma is that inhibition of TRPA1 inhibits ovalbumin-induced hyperresponsiveness in rats (Lieu et al. 2012 ).",

Extensive mechanisms exist to protect the lungs against environmental insults, and many of these processes are adaptive in nature, resulting in memory that increases sensitivity and responsiveness to antigenic stimuli. Adaptations are observed locally and systemically and involve responses by epithelial, nerve, muscle, and immune cells. In over 10 % of the population, the responses to environmental stimuli become pathological and result in excessive sensitivity and aberrant responses to both specific and nonspecific stimuli, and culminate in a progressive and deleterious remodeling of the airways and lungs. Environmental diseases, such as extrinsic asthma, rhinitis, and allergy are increasing and represent major health issues around the world. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying responses to environmental factors is required for more effective prevention and treatment of these disorders.",
