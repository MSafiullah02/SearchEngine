The CDC definition was used to characterize BSI as primary or secondary (urinary, respiratory, catheter-related, abdominal, skin and soft tissue infections, endocarditis, meningitis) [14]. Infection was categorized as sepsis or septic shock according to new sepsis definition. The date of collection of the first positive blood culture was defined as infection onset [15]. Appropriate antibiotic treatment was defined as one that included an antimicrobial agent with in vitro activity against the infecting isolates, initiated within 72 h from the onset of infection, at an adequate dosage.",

The most common type of infection was catheter-related (66; 46.8%), followed by primary BSI (28; 19.9%), urinary tract infections (16; 11.3%), abdominal infection (12; 8.5%), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (10; 7.1%) (Table 1). Coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) predominated (n = 69; 63 S. epidermidis, two S. haemolyticus, two S. lugdunensis, one S. capitis, and one S. hominis; 65 methicillin-resistant, 23 linezolid-resistant), followed by enterococci (n = 46; 11 VRE), S. aureus (n = 22; 10 methicillin-resistant carrying mecA gene, MRSA), and streptococci (n = 4; two S. agalactiae, one S. gallolyticus, one S. mitis). All 23 coagulase-negative staphylococci that showed linezolid MIC > 256 mg/l, were S. epidermidis, carried both C2534T and T2504A mutations and belonged to the ST22 clone. None of them carried the cfr gene or any mutation in the L4 ribosomal protein gene. Among the 11 VRE, eight were E. faecium carrying the vanA gene and belonging to ST117 (n = 4), ST17 (n = 3), and ST203 (n = 1), two were E. gallinarum, vanC-positive, and one E. faecalis vanA-positive belonging to ST28. MRSA belonged to ST80 (n = 4), ST30 (n = 4), and ST239 (n = 2). Overall 14-day fatality was 24.8% (35 patients). Table 1 shows univariate and multivariate analyses of predictors of BSI fatality. Multivariate analysis revealed septic shock (P 0.039; OR 4.0, CI 1.1\u201310.9) as independent predictor of fatality, while appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment (P 0.011; OR 0.20, CI 0.06\u20130.69) and catheter-related BSI (P 0.024; OR 0.28, CI 0.09\u20130.85) were identified as a predictor of good prognosis.",

A shift in BSI\u2019s epidemiology in Greek hospitals was observed in the last two decades towards predominance of Gram-negative bacteria, due to emergence and dissemination of very successful clones of carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacilli [5.6]. Even though in the EPIC II study infections due to Gram-negative bacteria predominated, the epidemiology of BSI varies widely between countries, with many showing a predominance of Gram-positive cocci [1, 6, 21].",

            "text": "As compared to carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacilli, fatality of BSIs due to Gram-positive cocci was lower (24.8%), as previously shown [2]. The most consistent predictor of survival in the literature was administration of appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy [1, 22]. In the present study, despite the high rate of multi-drug resistant pathogens (86; 61.0%; 10 MRSA, 65 MR-CNS, 11 VRE), 86.5% of patients received appropriate empiric treatment. This high percentage can be explained by the fact that these pathogens are prevalent in the Greek healthcare system, leading to an empiric initiation of anti-Gram-positive antibiotics, such as glycopeptides (vancomycin or teicoplanin), linezolid, or daptomycin in all patients with a severe infection [5]. Glycopeptides were the preferred agent as empiric coverage in our cohort, with only 11 isolates (8.7%) being resistant. In the EUROBACT study, vancomycin was also the most commonly used antibiotic with anti-Gram positive action, followed by linezolid and daptomycin [1]. Even though many studies have shown during the last decades an increase of vancomycin MIC among MRSA [23], a phenomenon known as MIC creep, our isolates had an MIC \u2264 1 mg/l, for which vancomycin remains the preferred agent. A previous Greek multicenter study showed a decrease of MIC among MRSA from 2008 to 2012, which was probably due to the reduction of vancomycin utilization in favor to newer therapeutic options, such as linezolid and daptomycin [8].",

In the present study, CR-BSIs accounted for more than half of BSIs, and can explain the fact that CNS predominated among Gram-positive cocci, since they have a propensity to colonize indwelling devices and subsequently provoke infection. Reinforcing strategies for prevention of CR-BSI are the following: training of medical personnel on antisepsis, introduction of checklist for CVC insertion, and education of nursing personnel for disinfecting techniques for inserted catheters [25].",

Consistently with the literature, prior administration of linezolid was the only risk factor for development of infection by LR isolates [11, 12, 26]. Among patients with LR-CNS BSI, 39.1% did not receive linezolid in the last 2 months prior to BSI development, indicating that such isolates disseminated to patients in nearby beds, as previously shown [11, 26]. All LR S. epidermidis belonged to ST22 and carried both C2534T, T2504A; aforementioned ST and mutations were found in previous studies from our setting and other Greek and European hospitals underlying the success of that clone [11, 13, 26]. The efficacy of LR-CNS in disseminating and becoming endemic in different hospital wards, including those with low linezolid consumption, was shown in a Spanish university hospital. In that study, LR S. epidermidis belonged to ST2 and apart from G2576 T 23S rDNA mutation, they also carried a variety of mutations in the genes encoding L3 and L4 ribosomal proteins [27]. No isolate in the present study carried the transferable cfr gene which encodes an rRNA methyltransferase; this gene has been detected in CNS, S. aureus and even enterococci, especially in central and north America [28].",
