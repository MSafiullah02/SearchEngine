So far there is only limited insight in the viral part of the microbiome, the human virome. Viruses may cause severe infections in immunocompromised individuals, such as transplant recipients [3\u20136]. Lung transplant recipients (LTRs) receive high level immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, severe infections with viruses of the Herpesviridae family as Cytomegalovirus (HCMV), or with respiratory viruses may occur and are a major cause of morbidity and mortality after lung transplantation [3,7]. Also non-pathogenic viruses replicate at high levels in immunosuppressed persons. Especially Torque Teno Viruses (TTV) and other members of the Anelloviridae family, which are highly prevalent in the human population, extensively replicate under immunosuppression [5,8]. These non-pathogenic viruses have recently gained particular interest as first data shows that the TTV-level may reflect the extent of immunosuppression after lung transplantation and may be a useful marker for optimizing immunosuppressive therapy [9\u201312].",

In short, 5\u03bcl of extracted eluate and 5\u03bcM random primers were incubated for 5min at 65\u00b0C. Then 20\u03bcl total volume reactions were set up as described in Lewandowska et al. [18]. The resulting cDNA was denatured for 2min at 94\u00b0C, cooled 5min at 10\u00b0C and used for second-strand synthesis. Similarly, the DNA from the extracted eluate was randomly amplified by using 5\u03bcl of template. The resulting DNA derived from both RNA and DNA templates was subsequently amplified in separate reactions by PCR using 4\u03bcl of input DNA from the previous step, 0.25\u03bcM dNTP mix (Promega), 2mM MgCl2, 1x AmpliTaq Gold Buffer II (Applied Biosystems), 0.05U/\u03bcl AmpliTaq Gold Polymerase (Applied Biosystems) and 1\u03bcM of an anchor specific primer for a total volume of 50\u03bcl [18]. The products were quantified by Qubit dsDNA BR Assay (Invitrogen) and diluted to 0.4ng/\u03bcl. Equal amounts of the amplified and diluted cDNA and DNA were pooled together at 0.4ng/\u03bcl, and used as input for library preparation using the NexteraXT Library Preparation kit (Illumina). Samples were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform, single-read 150bp. BAL and plasma samples from the seven follow-up LTRs were processed in duplicate.

We then mapped the decontaminated reads with Bowtie2 v.2.2.9 [20] to 249 verified complete anellovirus genome sequences from NCBI, including strains of the 5 known main TTV genogroups and TTV-mini and -midi strains. The rest of the reads were mapped against 49087 viral complete genomes obtained from the NCBI GenBank [21] nuccore database [15,18]. We estimated the abundance of each viral strain in every individual, expressed as reads per million. Given the high correlation between duplicates (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.898; p<0.001), we decided to use the average abundance of each strain for further analyses. Reads not mapping to any of the above genomes were considered to be of unknown origin. The Shannon diversity index (H) of anellovirus strains was estimated for each sample based on the abundance of each strain and using the Vegan R package [22].",

Eukaryotic viruses identified in both, BAL and plasma, belonged mainly to the Anelloviridae, Herpesviridae and Coronaviridae families. In both body compartments of LTRs prokaryotic viruses of the Siphoviridae family, including Propionibacterium phages and Pseudomonas phages, and of the Myoviridae family, including Staphylococcus phages and Streptococcus phages, were identified. In plasma of healthy controls, only two eukaryotic viral families were identified, Anelloviridae and Herpesviridae (Fig 1C) as well as the two mentioned prokaryotic families.

In both compartments various eukaryotic viruses were detected, and similar to what was shown previously, always anelloviruses were the most abundant ones [26,27], followed by members of the Herpesviridae family [5,26]. This is of particular importance given that herpesviruses contribute significantly to clinical complications after transplantation, by causing severe infections and by serving as trigger for rejection processes [28]. Other respiratory viruses identified especially in the BAL, such as coronaviruses and rhinoviruses, are important pathogens which may also contribute to rejection of the transplanted lung [29,30]. In both body compartments also prokaryotic viruses, especially Myoviridae and Siphoviridae (Caudovirales order) were found. Similarly, DeVlaminck et al. [5] found that Caudovirales were highly abundant after transplantation. While different studies show that presence and variety of different bacteriophages in the gut may contribute to human health or disease [31] such clinical effects are not clear for bacteriophages found in blood or lung. In the plasma samples, sequencing reads aligning to some viral families were identified, whose clinical significance in these patients is not fully understood. Given the low number of reads, their presence should be confirmed in further studies.",

Also the present findings showed a clearly lower TTV abundance in healthy individuals compared to LTRs who receive drug-induced immunosuppression. The TTV-load, measured by a PCR assay covering the vast majority of TTV strains, is currently considered as a potential marker for guiding immunosuppressive drug therapy after transplantation [8,33,34]. However, so far no detailed and comprehensive analyses of the anellovirus populations present in the transplanted host and its dynamics over time have been performed.

So far it is unclear what drives these dynamics and leads to such large changes in the individual level of replication of the individual virus strains over time. Also for HCMV it was revealed in the last years that different genotypes show a complex and not understood replication pattern over time after lung transplantation [38,39]. It remains to be evaluated whether host factors or virus specific factors drive such dynamics and what this may mean for the clinical development of the patients. Interestingly, Blatter et al. [34] recently reported that TTV from different genera are associated with different outcomes in pediatric lung transplantation. It remains to be investigated whether particular strains are also associated with acute rejection or other longer-term outcomes.",

We speculate that the inflammatory response against other viruses eventually also may impair TTV replication [11,40].
