This appears to be clinically relevant since the sudden and unexpected interruption of the planned care, together with the emotional stress consequent to the fear of getting infected and to the socio-economic impact of pandemic, could result in a high risk of recurrence of harmful alcohol abuse and/or severe psychological distress (8), which, in turn, could directly or indirectly favor the deterioration of the clinical conditions. Furthermore, the web-based frequent interaction with the patients may unveil early symptoms and signs which can be promptly reported by the psychologist to the physician, thus allowing the prompt recognition of the onset of complications. This would assume even a greater relevance in a time of very limited access to health care services.Second, once the COVID-19 pandemic will fade, the use of web-based technologies should be implemented in the current clinical practice. Even if the traditional access to healthcare services cannot be substituted, as suggested by the early drop-out of the two patients who joined the webprogram without attending any previous traditional session, the integration between traditional and web-based programs offers the opportunity of extending and diversifying the pathways of care, overcoming potential logistic limitations of the access to care, and better rationalizing the use of healthcare resources.",

Data are reported as mean and standard deviation. Comparison was made by ANOVA for repeated measures. The CORE-OM questionnaire consists of 34 questions exploring four dimensions of the patient's feelings over the last week: 1. subjective well-being; 2. problems/symptoms; 3. life functioning; and 4. risk/harm. Higher scores indicate psychological global distress. The DERS contains items that reflect problems with emotional regulation. It consists of the following subscales: 1. awareness of emotions (awareness); 2. understanding of emotions (clarity); 3. acceptance of emotions (non-acceptance); 4. difficulties engaging in goal-directed behavior when experiencing negative emotions (goals); 5. refrain from impulsive behavior when experiencing negative emotions (impulse subscale); 6. access to emotional regulation strategies perceived as effective (strategies).
