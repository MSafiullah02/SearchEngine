This mechanism has not, however, ensured that measures are fully coordinated. Thus, the Basque Country declared a public health emergency before any other region, whereas Catalonia requested a complete shutdown of the region, including closure of air, sea, and land ports. Madrid, La Rioja, and Vitoria banned gatherings of more than 1000 people. These measures were accompanied by a range of social distancing measures, including closure of schools, universities, libraries, centres for older people, and sporting venues, and even restricting all movement in some of the most affected areaS.3\n",

There is a particular shortage of face masks caused by early panic buying. These shortages have encouraged profiteering, with private laboratories, for example, charging exorbitant amounts for tests.8 In response, the central government has centralised purchasing and introduced price controls on medicines9 requiring companies producing relevant equipment to inform the central government of their stocks within 48 h.",

The problems are being exacerbated by the quarantining of a growing number of health workers exposed to patients who are infected.10 The new decree permits hiring graduates without specialisation, final year medical and nursing students, and extending contracts of medical residents.",

The Spanish media has largely acted responsibly, disseminating accurate information and debunking fake news stories circulating on social media networks. These developments have coincided with changing attitudes among the Spanish population. Initially, the disease attracted little attention, but this calm soon gave way to panic and hoarding of key supplies once cases began to increase. However, many manifestations of solidarity have been seen, such as supporting health professionals, those who are most vulnerable, and voluntary social distancing, including greater home working.",

First, additional financial resources are needed to support regional health systems, each with different initial resources and current challenges. Second, long-term underinvestment in health services, as seen in many countries following the 2008 financial crisis, impairs their resilience by depleting their ability to respond to surges in need for health care with sufficient health professionals, intensive care unit beds, protective equipment, diagnostic test kits, and mechanical ventilators. Third, although Spanish residents do seem largely to have responded responsibly so far, it will be important to draw on evidence from behavioural sciences to ensure that this conduct continues over what could be many months. Fourth, although coordination between the national and regional governments has generally been good, work will be needed to ensure this continues over the next few months, with an understanding that politicians must not be allowed to exploit the situation for political gain. Finally, once the pandemic is over, Spain will need to address the decade of underinvestment in its previously strong health sector, which has left it struggling at this time of crisis.",
