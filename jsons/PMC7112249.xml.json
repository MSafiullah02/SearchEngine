Each disaster response can be universally reduced to the aggregate actions of individuals who are called on to make complex, immediate, and high-stake decisions that ultimately contribute to the outcome. Although the process always begins with first responders, it systematically evolves and expands throughout the entire health care system, inclusive of 9-1-1 call systems, emergency medical systems (EMS), triage centers, initial receiving hospitals, and definitive care and postacute facilities, extending well into available rehabilitation and psychosocial support infrastructure.

The 3 scenarios established 3 broad groups that escalate in complexity: one that impacts the burn care system, one that impacts the broader health care system, and one that reflects an impact on critical infrastructure.Box 1These are the 3 basic types of burn mass casualty incidents relying on the National Incident Management System order of classification; these classifications were first published in 2014\nBurn Mass Casualty Incident (BMCI) (Burn Disaster) ScenariosType I BMCI:\u2022Description and example: catastrophic event, to include multiple casualties with various and combined burn injuries over a wide geographic area, such as earthquakes to include the 1994 Northridge earthquake,68, 69 the 9/11 attacks,70, 71, 72 the Great East Japan earthquake (2011),51, 73 or an improvised nuclear device.57, 60, 74, 75\n\u2022Impact: critical infrastructure\u2022Logic: impact to the infrastructure could be devastating. When the infrastructure is damaged, from highways to utilities, the magnitude of the disaster is amplified by the compromised facilities. When the facilities in which care is provided are damaged or essential utilities are disrupted, in addition to the surge of both burn and general traumatic injuries, most likely the management of the disaster will be suboptimal. Radiation-related incidents would include activation of the Radiation Injury Treatment Network, a cooperative effort of the National Marrow Donor Program and the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.76\n\nType II BMCI:\u2022Description and example: multiple-aspect burn disaster, such as an explosion, with significant numbers of traumatic as well as burn-injured patients producing multiple casualties with various blunt force and combined thermal injuries. This type of disaster would include the Madrid train bombings (2004)65, 66 and London subway attack (2005).67\n\u2022Impact: health care system\u2022Logic: impact to the health care system may be significant; due to the nature of the disaster, there may or may not be ample critical care and trauma care beds that can be adapted to care for those burn-injured patients who need less intensive attention by burn care professionals. Given the competing interests of traumatic injury with burn injury, filling the need without crossing into a crisis surge capacity may be problematic in the immediate geographic area near the site of the disaster.\nType III BMCI:\u2022Description and example: an isolated burn disaster with mostly thermal injuries, such the Rhode Island Station Night Club fire (2003)61, 62, 63 or the Kiss Nightclub fire in Santa Maria, Brazil (2013).64\n\u2022Impact: burn care system\u2022Logic: impact to the burn care system may be significant; but due to the nature of the disaster, critical care and trauma care beds can be adapted to provide care for burn-injured patients who need less intensive attention by burn care professionals.\n\n",
