The compensatory ventilatory response to hypoxaemia, increased minute ventilation, may lead to extreme hypocapnia. Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) diffuses through tissues about 20 times more rapidly than does oxygen (O 2 ), and these properties likely underlie the disproportional pulmonary exchange of CO 2 and O 2 in these patients. The pathoanatomical and pathophysiological basis for respiratory failure in COVID-19 is yet undetermined, but diffuse alveolar damage with interstitial thickening leading to compromised gas exchange is a plausible mechanism. 2 Varying degrees of atelectasis and consolidation likely contribute.",

            "text": "Experiments in hypobaric chambers have revealed that hypocapnic hypoxia is not usually accompanied by air hunger; instead, a paradoxical feeling of calm and well-being may result. This phenomenon has been coined 'silent hypoxia'. End-tidal CO 2 values in the 1.4e2.0 kPa range have been reported in COVID-19 patients, but apart from a rapid respiratory rate the clinical presentation in these patients can be misleading. We have observed patients with extreme hypoxaemia showing little distress; rather they tend to be impassive, cooperative, and haemodynamically stable. However, sudden and rapid respiratory decompensation may occur. This particular clinical presentation in COVID-19 patients contrasts with our previous experience with critically ill patients in respiratory failure, in which patients with decompensated heart failure, sepsis, or massive pulmonary embolism tend to present with air hunger, dyspnoea, distress, arterial hypotension, and isocapnic or hypercapnic hypoxia.",

            "text": "The physiological hallmarks of hypocapnic hypoxia have been studied extensively in aviation medicine. 3 Decompression to high altitude causes severe hypoxaemia, which triggers the carotid chemoreceptors and sparks a brisk respiratory response with ensuing hypocapnia. The respiratory alkalosis shifts the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve to the left, thereby increasing haemoglobin's oxygen affinity, evident from a decrease in the P 50 value and an increase in arterial oxygen saturation (Sa O2 ). 4 In addition, the alveolar gas equation predicts that decreased alveolar CO 2 tension (P\u0410 CO2 ) will result in a corresponding increase in alveolar oxygen tension (PA O2 ). Combined, these two mechanisms will increase Sa O2 in hypocapnic hypoxia compared with an isocapnic or hypercapnic hypoxic state. We speculate that most clinicians' intuitive understanding of the effect size produced by these mechanisms for a given change in Pa CO2 may be limited.",

In a simulated high-altitude parachute jump from 30 000 ft, nine volunteers from the Norwegian Special Operations Command underwent repeated blood gas testing while breathing air at different ambient pressures. 5 Despite Pa O2 values of 3.3 (2.9e3.7) kPa (median [range]), eight out of nine participants showed no signs of respiratory distress and were cooperative and alert with stable haemodynamics. Interestingly, a wide range of Sa O2 values across individuals were found for any given inspiratory oxygen pressure. At ambient pressure 42.1 kPa, corresponding to a pressure altitude of approximately 22 000 ft, Sa O2 values ranged from 52% to 90%, with corresponding values of Pa CO2 of 2.16e4.17 kPa and Pa O2 of 3.22e5.61 kPa. One individual achieved Sa O2 of 90% with Pa O2 of 5.6 kPa and Pa CO2 of 2.16 kPa, illustrating how a relatively high Sa O2 value can be found despite a very low Pa O2 . Linear regression analysis (Fig 1) estimates the effect size of hyperventilation, that is how at one given inspiratory PO 2 a change in Pa CO2 affects Sa O2 . Such visualisation can contribute to a better understanding of how substantially a left shift in the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve changes Sa O2 .",

The physiology of hypocapnic hypoxia has implications for how we interpret physiological parameters. Instinctively, we judge an Sp O2 value of 93% as fair.

Ensuring timely hospital admission can therefore be challenging. These patients are evaluated by general practitioners, often by telephone because of quarantine rules, or by paramedics or emergency physicians in a prehospital context. To assess the risk of imminent respiratory failure, clinical evaluation should give emphasis to respiratory rate, work of breathing, use of accessory musculature, and skin perfusion. Pulse oximetry readings should be interpreted in the light of Pa CO2 values or while acknowledging the absence of this important information. Although arterialealveolar difference in P CO2 increases during low cardiac output states and increased dead space ventilation, end-tidal CO 2 values have been reported to correlate well with Pa CO2 in nonintubated patients, especially during hypocapnia. 6 End-tidal CO 2 can be easily measured in a pre-hospital setting.",
