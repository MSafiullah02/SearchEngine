Within 1 month, there was the largest outbreak outside the Middle East with 186 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infections resulting in 36 fatalities. 1 There were relatively few cases of MERS-CoV infection in patients requiring chronic hemodialysis. Here we report the precaution measures, hemodialysis methods, and outcomes of the contacted patients in our dialysis unit (DU).",

We believe this was because the precaution measures and isolations were effective. During the MERS outbreak, we practiced intensified precaution measures for dialysis patients, given their increased susceptibility to infection. 3, 4 In a report from Saudi Arabia in 2013, there were 9 additional MERS-CoV infections in the DU from 1 confirmed patient without precaution measures. 5 There are some reports on the management of SARS in hemodialysis patients. [6] [7] [8] But there are no data on the effect of precaution measures for hemodialysis patients who have contacted a SARS case. One study showed that surgical masks would be helpful for preventing transmission of SARS in patients in the DU. 9 Though the World Health Organization recommended the N95 mask in the precaution measures for MERS, 2 it can cause physiological stress. One Taiwanese study showed that wearing the N95 mask for 4 hours during hemodialysis significantly reduced P a O 2 and increased adverse respiratory outcomes in hemodialysis patients. 9 With a large number of patients exposed to an infection in the DU, isolation and IIH are practically impossible owing to limited space as well as device and HCP availability. We isolated and classified all patients. IIH was performed for patients with grade 1 exposure or those with symptoms possibly related to MERS. CH was performed for patients with grade 2 or 3 exposure and no symptoms possibly related to MERS. Because fewer patients stayed in the DU, we could maintain more space between the patients during CH, reducing the possibility of transmission.",

Direct observation is an effective method for collecting real-time, naturalistic behavioral information about a specific process, 5 and this method is commonplace in infection prevention.Herein, we describe our experience training observers to conduct CHG bathing observations, and we present findings from pilot observations. methods",
