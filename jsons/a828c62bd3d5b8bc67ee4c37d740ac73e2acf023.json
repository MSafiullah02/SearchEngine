            "text": "The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, can be diagnosed using RT-qPCR, but inadequate access to reagents and equipment has slowed disease detection and impeded efforts to mitigate viral spread. Alternative approaches based on combinations of isothermal amplification and CRISPR-mediated detection, such as the SHERLOCK ( S pecific H igh S ensitivity E nzymatic R eporter Un LOCK ing) technique, offer reduced dependence on RT-qPCR equipment, but previously reported methods required multiple fluid handling steps, complicating their deployment outside clinical labs. Here we developed a simple test chemistry called STOP (SHERLOCK Testing in One Pot) for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in one hour that is suitable for point-of-care use. This simplified test, STOPCovid, provides sensitivity comparable to RT-qPCR-based SARS-CoV-2 tests and has a limit of detection of 100 copies of viral genome input in saliva or nasopharyngeal swabs per reaction. Using lateral flow readout, the test returns result in 70 minutes, and using fluorescence readout, the test returns result in 40 minutes. Moreover, we validated STOPCovid using nasopharyngeal swabs from COVID-19 patients and were able to correctly diagnose 12 positive and 5 negative patients out of 3 replicates. We envision that implementation of STOPCovid will significantly aid \"test-trace-isolate\" efforts, especially in low-resource settings, which will be critical for long-term public health safety and effective reopening of the society.",

Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris Cas12b (AacCas12b), which has been shown to be thermostable at 55C (Shmakov et al., 2015) , has been incorporated into a one-pot detection assay with LAMP (Li et al., 2019) , but because it is unstable at the high temperature required for LAMP, we did not find adequate sensitivity and performance. Of the various Cas proteins we explored, Cas12b from Alicyclobacillus acidiphilus (AapCas12b) (Teng et al., 2018) maintained sufficient activity in the same temperature range as LAMP ( Figure 2B ).",

To remedy this, we searched for alternative orthologs with similar protein sequences to AapCas12b and found that AacCas12b shared a 95% sequence homology (Shmakov et al., 2015) . Additionally, the AacCas12b tracrRNA and predicted AapCas12b tracrRNA are 97% identical. Given the high degree of similarity between AapCas12b and AacCas12b protein and tracrRNA, we surmised that the sgRNA for AacCas12b should closely match the cognate AapCas12b DR-tracrRNA hybrid. Indeed, reactions combining AapCas12b enzyme with AacCas12b scaffold sgRNA produced more robust and specific nuclease activity compared to the previously published AapCas12b sgRNA ( Figure 2C ).",

The disposable test cartridge can be designed to be compatible with scalable manufacturing processes such as injection molding to allow for high throughput manufacturing. The cartridge would reduce both test complexity and risk of amplicon contamination by processing the sample input internally and directing the completed STOPCovid reaction mixture toward the lateral flow strip for readout.
