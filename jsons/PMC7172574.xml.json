In other words, aim for as few different people as possible working daily in the surgical suite or procedural locations. For instance, if there are 8 ORs sharing 1master ventilatory system and 8 essential cases to be done (each lasting 1\u20132 hours), the ideal solution is to have 2 teams complete the 8 cases in the available rooms. This contrasts sharply with the traditional 8 first case starts in 8 rooms with 8 teams of providers! The benefit to staff and the organization with the \u201cinfection-control\u201d approach is that if a patient were found to have COVID-19 after surgery, fewer personnel were exposed.",

Note that this does not mean literally that a room can be used just once a day. Rather, let anesthesia and nursing teams (and surgeons/proceduralists if they have >1 case) work in more than 1 room so that each room receives deep cleaning between cases.",

Instead, have most patients recover in the room where they had surgery. This is done routinely in Japan\u2014with the anesthesiologist recovering their patient\u2014because few hospitals have a phase I postanesthesia care unit.33 When the time of patient recovery was compared between a Japanese hospital where anesthesiologist recovery was routine practice versus the University of Iowa where there is a phase I postanesthesia care unit and nurses, the longest recovery time in Japan was briefer than the shortest recovery time in theUnited States.34 Clinicians should consider selecting anesthetic drugs to minimize recovery times and possibly accomplish phase 1 recovery within the OR itself.35,36 Consider, when appropriate, using peripheral nerve block instead of general anesthesia.37,38",
