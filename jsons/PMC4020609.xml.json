Hantaviruses are carried by rodents, and transmission to humans is caused by the inhalation of infected rodent excreta [3]. China is the most severe endemic area of HFRS in the world, with 30,000-50,000 cases reported annually, which account for > 90% of total numbers worldwide [4,5]. Shaanxi province is one of the most severely affected provinces in China. Xi\u2019an is the center district of Shaanxi province and has had an increased incidence and mortality rate in the last three years [6]. Until now, it has been reported that all HFRS cases in this district are caused by hantaan virus (HTNV), a major serotype of Hantavirus [6], and the disease usually occurs in the spring and autumn/winter, with two incidence peaks [7]. Furthermore, a large number of patients in this epidemic area were adults, which was in sharp contrast to the predominantly pediatric cases seen in the dengue epidemics in southeast Asia [8,9].",

The typical disease progresses through five phases: febrile, hypotensive, oliguric, diuretic, and convalescent [11,12]. A hallmark of HFRS is capillary leak syndrome, which causes edema and hemorrhage, suggesting that the vascular endothelium is the primary target of virus infection [13,14]. In view of the rapidly expanding population and high mortality rate of infection in this district [6], it is essential to obtain a more comprehensive and better understanding of the clinical characteristics and outcomes in critical patients with this disease and to help clinicians engage in timely monitoring and effective supportive therapy in the early stages of the disease to improve the final survival rate.",

Commonly, the so-called acute stage of the disease is defined as the period of febrile, hypotensive and oliguric phases.

Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient was used to determine the relationship between the clinical manifestations, laboratory values, complications and survival outcome, respectively. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify clinical risk factors for prognosis. Predicting values for prognosis of the laboratory parameters were tested with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and quantified by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) and the 95% confidence interval (CI). Kaplan-Meier analysis was used for the cumulative proportion surviving and 28-day mortality rate in the critical patients. A two-tailed P < .05 was considered statistically significant.",

This observation indicated that the fatality of critical patients with HFRS was high and was similar to the mortality rate of severe septic shock patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) [18-20]. In this study, a majority of patients enrolled were male and farmers, with high incidence and obvious seasonal distribution (Table 1).

Generally, the hypotensive phase of HFRS (e.g., low blood pressure and circulation collapse) usually occurs between day 3 and day 7 of the clinical course, and some critical patients even exhibit overlapping hypotensive and oliguric phases combined with various fatal complications. During this period, timely and systematically supportive treatment, including mechanical ventilation combined with continuous blood purification (CBP), vasoactive drugs and nutritional supplement, are necessary to ensure survival. However, some critical patients still died of refractory shock, ARDS, multiorgan bleeding, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Patients who have passed through the critical phase may manifest obvious oliguria with AKI. The durations of the oliguric phase in patients with HFRS are obviously different based upon the degree of AKI [16] and the influence on applications of RRT including continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) [22,23]; only a minority of critical patients die during this phase. Furthermore, it is an unfortunate truth that in addition to the critical condition of the disease on admission, the patient\u2019s economic status may also influence the prognosis directly or indirectly.",

The agitation, conjunctival hemorrhage, coma, cardiac failure, ARDS and encephalopathy were all negatively correlated with the survival outcome (Table 7). Although there was no significant relationship, the difference was obvious in pleural effusion and pericardial effusion found in the survivors vs. non-survivors (Table 4). According to the pathophysiologic characteristics of HFRS, the pleural and pericardial effusion can reflect the degree of body edema and may increase the risk of the occurrence of pulmonary infection, ARDS and heart failure. All of these findings highlight that it would be dangerous to ignore the critical condition of the disease and the increased probability of death when patients exhibit clinical manifestations of ARDS and encephalopathy, and conjunctival hemorrhage can be considered to be a local manifestation of severe organ bleeding with poor outcome. Furthermore, ARDS, conjunctival hemorrhage and coma were identified as risk factors for prognosis by binary logistic regression analysis (Table 8), which underscores the importance of clinicians\u2019 alertness to the occurrence of potentially fatal complications. Additionally, although cardiac failure was not a risk factor for death in the present report, it deserves further study in larger samples of critical patients, especially the cases of deaths.",

In this study, all the critical patients had different stages of AKI, and 62 cases (82.7%) exhibited ARF, the third stage of AKI [16] (Table 5). Interestingly, we observed that the frequency of ARF in the survivors was obviously higher than that of the non-survivors (Table 5). ARF and Scr were positively correlated with the survival outcome (Table 7); non-survivors were also found to have lower Scr levels (Table 6).These results can be explained by the fact that some critical patients died during the overlapping phase because of other fatal complications when ARF was not obviously detected. According to the data, we can conclude that the stage of AKI and the duration of the oliguric phase during the acute stage are not a directly influential factor for prognosis because of the application of RRT.",

According to the pathophysiologic mechanism of HFRS, it has been widely accepted that severe plasma leakage, massive bleeding and/or profound shock may lead to tissue hypoperfusion, potentially rendering AKI and hepatic injury [25]; the high level of HGB was closely related to the degree of pachyhemia; the low level of PLT was related to the decreased platelet production or increased platelet destruction [26-28]; the low level of ALB correlates with degree of the loss of vascular integrity and enhanced vascular permeability, which also usually appears in patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) [3,29]. Compared to the survivors, the non-survivors were found to be more critical, with a higher degree of inflammatory reaction and coagulation abnormality, which is in line with the previous reports on patients with DHF [30-32]. Furthermore, although the AUCs were not higher than 0.900 and would be influenced by small samples or treatments, ROC analysis still revealed that the WBC levels, PT and APTT times were statistically significant for predicting death (Table 9, Figure 2). In total, the laboratory results may reflect the severity of the disease to a degree, and clinicians should be alert to their dynamic changes during the acute stage, ensure close monitoring and thereby initiate a timely management as necessary.",

Most patients with severe clinical conditions were sent to our medical center, but it is likely that outside of our center, there were still a significant number of critical HFRS patients who were admitted to local hospitals. Therefore, the demographic, epidemiological characteristics and mortality rate in critical patients may have been biased. Second, the clinical manifestations may be biased by clinicians based on his or her personal recognition of the clinical severity. In this study, we were unable to calculate the acute physiology, age, chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) score, sepsis related organ failure assessment (SOFA) and simplified acute physiology score (SAPS II) of the critical patients on admission because of the loss of detailed clinical data on central nervous system dysfunction. These data may be very important for predicting the prognosis. Third, the relatively small number of cases made the statistical power quite small, especially for multivariate logistic regression analysis used for identifying risk factors for death in the critical patients. Finally, the clinical outcomes and classifications of HFRS patients might be biased by the lack of a more standardized protocol for the management of patients with HFRS.",
