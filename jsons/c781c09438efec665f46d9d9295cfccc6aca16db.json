Yet, existing methods either partially leverage such context information or combine different types of contexts using a global weighting scheme, failing to capture the phenomenon that the importance of each context is also context-dependent rather than the same for all recommendation. In this paper, we propose a model to exploit spatial-temporal contexts in a POI-guided attention mechanism for POI recommendation. Such an attention mechanism offers us high flexibility to capture the POIspecific importance of each context. Experimental results on two realworld datasets collected from Foursquare and Gowalla demonstrate that the POI-specific context importance significantly improves the performance of POI recommendation.",

To benefit LBSN users and promote locationbased marketing, POI recommendation on LBSNs has become an essential task aiming to recommend new POIs to a user according to his personal preferences and to facilitate his exploration of the city [18] .",

First, locations of POIs are important factors for POI recommendations, since users prefer to visit POIs that are not far away. For example, in Gowalla and Foursquare, 90% of users' consecutive check-ins are within the distance less than 50km [15] . Second, users' preference over POIs exhibit salient temporal periodic patterns, e.g., restaurants are preferred in dinner time and theaters are visited more frequently in weekend than in weekdays. Finally, a user's check-in records form a POI sequence with continuous distance and time intervals, offering various sequential patterns [12] , e.g., POIs planned in a trip. In sum, users' check-in records contain rich spatialtemporal context information that should be synthetically integrated to reflect the dynamics of the underlying check-in system.",

However, these methods only partially leverage the spatial context and temporal context, and they integrate these contexts using a global weighting scheme [9, 19, 25] , assuming that the importance of each context is unchanged for all POIs. These methods fail to capture the dynamic role of context, given that the importance of each context is POI-specific. Let's say we are going to make POI recommendation to a big foodie at 3 p.m. We may push a restaurant to him considering his long-term preference as a foodie. However, recommending a restaurant must happen at the right time, e.g., dinner time, rather than 3 p.m, at which restaurant cannot meet the user's current needs. In this scenario where restaurant is a candidate POI, we should inhibit the importance of user's long-term preference and let the temporal context play a more decisive role in user's check-in choice. That is to say, each context's importance to current recommendation should be POI-specific.",

We can observe that removing any attention would cause performance degradation on both datasets. This phenomenon indicates that a global weighting scheme cannot effectively organize multiple heterogeneous contexts, and the attention mechanism plays a critical role while integrating the spatial-temporal contexts. Figure 3 and Fig. 4 present the hit@k and MRR@k of the STAR and baseline methods respectively. It can be observed that the proposed STAR method achieves the best performance under different settings of k on both datasets and both metrics, which demonstrates the superiority of our method to these state-of-the-art methods. We take a detailed account of Fig. 3 as an example. Since UG considers only the geographical influence, it gets the worst performance. UTG further incorporates temporal periodic patterns (time slot in a day), resulting in a slightly better performance than UG. FPMF-LR and ST-RNN consider the sequential dependency and ignore the temporal periodic patterns, and its performance is better than that of UTG. This indicates that sequential dependence is crucial to POI recommendation. ST-RNN outperforms FPMC-LR in most cases except the case of k = 1 on the Foursquare dataset, this is due to the modeling of continuous distance and time intervals. GE and Geo-Teaser both consider all contexts, and thus perform better than the above methods. However, they just utilize these contexts to constrain POIs' representation learning, and combine the involved contexts using a global weighting scheme. STAR uses a POI-guided attention mechanism to distinguish the importance of different contexts, guaranteeing its superior performance against baseline methods.",

We directly compute the interactions between three types of factors and the true POI respectively, and compare the proportion of each part in the overall score. Specifically, we sample a user u from the Foursquare dataset for case study. u has 115 check-ins in total. We select her/his 10 consecutive checkins from January 6, 2013 to April 6, 2013, and present the changes in proportions over time in Fig. 5 . We have the following observations: (1) u visited the first 5 POIs in consecutive 5 days. As expected, the impact of the spatial context increases constantly, while the impact of user's long-term preference becomes negligible. (2) When predicting the 9th POI, the impact of the spatial context becomes very weak, which results from the fact that this check-in is more than one month away from the 8th check-in. This check-in is mainly triggered by user's long-term preference, since we find in the dataset that the 9th POI is the second most frequently visited POI among all check-ins of u. (3) The main reason for the last checkin is the temporal context, i.e., temporal periodic patterns (21:11) . We guess that the last POI is a place for relax, as most check-ins at this POI occurred at non-working hours.",

In this way, we can flexibly and accurately capture the dynamic nature of different contexts.

(b) The spatial context refers to the geographical influence of user u's historical check-ins, e.g., POI {i} at time t (t < t). Ii represents POI i's influence vector. f (\u00b7) and g(\u00b7) are the geographical influence function and the time decay function.",
