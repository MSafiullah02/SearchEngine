CAstV was also recently associated with an unusual condition in chicks called \"white chicks.\" Some hatcheries in certain states of Brazil have reported several incubation problems, mortality, and the presence of chicks with white plumages over the past several months. These chicks were termed locally as \"white chicks.\" The present work investigated 30 chicks with this unusual condition using a multidisciplinary approach. Postmortem examination of each chick showed enlarged livers and intestines that were full of liquid and gas (30/30). The pancreas, kidneys, and spleen were pale (30/30). The other organs did not show any macroscopic alterations. CAstV, chicken parvovirus (ChPV), avian nephritis virus (ANV), avian rotavirus (ARtV), avian reovirus (AReoV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), and fowl adenovirus group I (FAdV-1) were tested in the intestines, pancreas, proventriculus, gizzard, liver, spleen, bursa, kidneys, thymus, lung, heart, brain, and yolk sac in each chick. All organs and yolk sacs were positive for CAstV in different titres and negative for the other tested viruses. The partial molecular characterization of the ORF 1b gene of CAstV using 28 sequences revealed a high similarity of the nucleotides and amino acids with sequences of CAstV from North America, Europe, and Asia, and our CAstV sequences clustered into a unique group that was separate from the other sequences. These results demonstrated that CAstV was associated with the white chick condition in Brazil. The virus was distributed in most organs, including the brain and yolk sac. These results suggest that the virus could be transmitted vertically. The molecular characterization also revealed that the CAstV associated with white chick condition was molecularly related to other CAstV sequences found worldwide.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Enteric diseases are of paramount importance to the national and global poultry industry (Jindal et al., 2012) . Runting-Stunting Syndrome (RSS) is an enteric syndrome with mild clinical signs, such as diarrhea, that causes flocks to mature in a non-uniform pattern, which causes the body weights at slaughter to differ broadly (Otto et al., 2006) . Olsen first reported RSS in the broiler industry in 1977 (Olsen, 1977) . This syndrome is a transmissible disease of uncertain etiology that affects chickens early in life (Goodwin et al., 1993; Kang et al., 2012b) . Enteric viruses, such as CAstV, ChPV, ANV, ARtV, AReoV, and FAdV-1 are related and have been detected in chickens with signs of RSS Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2011; Mettifogo et al., 2014) . However, CAstV is recognised as the causal agent of enteritis in chickens, primarily young chicks, and it has been detected in one-day-old chicks (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008; Mettifogo et al., 2014) . There are actually 2 astroviruses in chickens that are genetically characterised as ANV and CAstV (Imada et al., 2000; Baxendale and Mebatsion, 2004; Todd et al., 2009a) . Astroviruses are small, spherical viruses that are 25 to 35 nm in diameter and possess single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genomes approximately 7 kb in length. The genome encodes for 3 proteins: the non-structural (NS) polyprotein, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and the capsid protein. The NS polyprotein and capsid protein are encoded by individual open-reading frames (ORF), ORF1a and ORF2, and RdRP (ORF 1b) acts as a fusion protein to the NS protein (Kang et al., 2012a) . The genome begins with a 5 untranslated region (UTR), followed by the 3 ORFs, a 3 UTR, and a poly A tail (Koci and Schultz-Cherry, 2002; Nu\u00f1ez and Piantino Ferreira, 2013a) . ORF1a encodes the viral protease and is followed by ORF1b, which encodes the RNA polymerase (RdRp). ORF2 encodes the precursor of the capsid protein, and it is located downstream of ORF1b and prior to the untranslated region of the genome (Kang et al., 2012a ). An experimental infection with CAstV in one-day-old chickens showed mild diarrhea and distension of the small intestine (De Wit et al., 2011) . Clinical signs, including diarrhea, decreased food consumption, and nervousness, developed between one and 3 wk of age (Moser and Schultz-Cherry, 2005) . CAstV has been detected in the United Kingdom, United States, Korea, India, Netherlands, Croatia Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2007; Todd et al., 2009a,b; Smyth et al., 2010; Kang et al., 2012b; Koo et al., 2013) . And, more recently, in Brazil (Mettifogo et al., 2014) , which demonstrates a worldwide distribution (De Benedictis et al., 2011) . Most of the CAstV reported worldwide was detected in chickens with enteric disease. However, more recent reports have indicated an association of CAstV with a low hatching rate, weakness, and white plumage, which is characterised as an abnormal condition termed white chicks (Smyth et al., 2013) . The molecular characterization of CAstV is very important in understanding the relationship and genetic similarity among the different isolates worldwide. This study examined the viral agent that is associated with the condition of white chicks in Brazil and described the partial molecular characterization of the agent related with chicks with this unusual condition and its presence in Brazilian poultry.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 89, "end": 110, "text": "(Jindal et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 328, "end": 347, "text": "(Otto et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 407, "end": 420, "text": "(Olsen, 1977)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 522, "end": 544, "text": "(Goodwin et al., 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 545, "end": 564, "text": "Kang et al., 2012b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 699, "end": 728, "text": "Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 729, "end": 758, "text": "Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 759, "end": 782, "text": "Mettifogo et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 931, "end": 961, "text": "(Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 962, "end": 985, "text": "Mettifogo et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1086, "end": 1106, "text": "(Imada et al., 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1107, "end": 1137, "text": "Baxendale and Mebatsion, 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1138, "end": 1157, "text": "Todd et al., 2009a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1626, "end": 1646, "text": "(Kang et al., 2012a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1754, "end": 1785, "text": "(Koci and Schultz-Cherry, 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1786, "end": 1821, "text": "Nu\u00f1ez and Piantino Ferreira, 2013a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2063, "end": 2082, "text": "(Kang et al., 2012a", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2206, "end": 2227, "text": "(De Wit et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2349, "end": 2381, "text": "(Moser and Schultz-Cherry, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2481, "end": 2510, "text": "Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2511, "end": 2532, "text": "Todd et al., 2009a,b;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2533, "end": 2552, "text": "Smyth et al., 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2553, "end": 2572, "text": "Kang et al., 2012b;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2573, "end": 2590, "text": "Koo et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2623, "end": 2647, "text": "(Mettifogo et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2694, "end": 2722, "text": "(De Benedictis et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 3000, "end": 3020, "text": "(Smyth et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "After 2014, some states of Brazil began reporting problems in their hatcheries of an increase in pipped eggs and chick mortality immediately after hatching.

The present work demonstrates that CAstV was distributed in several organs, principally in the digestive tract, gizzard, and intestine. However, there were fewer proventriculus positive samples. CAstV also was detected in the yolk sac remnant, which suggests that the virus originated there and began to develop in the intestine with continuous propagation in the gizzard. The virus may subsequently move to the proventriculus. However, difficulty in the isolation of CAstV hinders our understanding of the path that the virus uses for propagation in the embryonic organism (Nu\u00f1ez et al., 2015c) . Further, CAstV was described in the accessory glands, such as the pancreas and liver, and in the lymphoid organs, such as the thymus, bursa, and spleen. However, few liver samples were positive for CAstV, which contrasts a Smyth et al. (2013) report in which the liver exhibited more prevalence for CAstV.

Different molecular analyses showed that CAstV was classified into several groups: group A prin-cipally included sequences of the United Kingdom, and group B (Smyth et al., 2012) formed two subgroups, Bi and Bii. The sequences obtained in the present work were grouped into a unique group, and the other sequences were grouped with isolates from India that belonged to Subgroup Bi (Bulbule et al., 2013) .
