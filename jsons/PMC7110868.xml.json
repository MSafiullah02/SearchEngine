Immunosuppressive regimes include a combination of calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine or tacrolimus), an anti-proliferative agent (mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), azathioprin or sirolimus) and prednisone. Impaired mucociliary function and cough reflex, altered lymphatic drainage and donor-transmitted pathogens encourage infections besides the immunosuppressive state [1]. The clinical course of upper and lower respiratory tract infections varies in these patients. They may present with systemic symptoms such as fever, myalgia and fatigue or localized upper or lower airway symptoms with or without deteriorated lung function. Development of any such symptoms necessitates urgent evaluation at the transplant centre. Diagnostic work-up includes patient history and physical examination, laboratory results, blood gas analysis, lung function testing, chest radiography in conjunction with either sputum samples or bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and possibly transbronchial biopsies. In the initial period after lung transplantation (LTx), infections tend to be bacterial, followed by fungal microorganisms and viruses [2], [3].",

In attempting to grade graft dysfunction, The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) defined the term bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) as an irreversible decline in FEV1 to less than 80% of baseline [9]. Treatment options in CLAD remain both limited and unpredictable and include immunomodulation with oral macrolides (azithromycin or clarithromycin), a leukotriene receptor antagonist (montelukast) and extracorporeal photopheresis [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15].",
