COVID-19 is transmitted by droplets, meaning that clinicians can be protected by gloves, gowns, eye shields, and masks. Disposable N95 masks seal tightly to the face and provide significantly better protection than surgical masks.",

However, the United States will need 3.5 billion N95 masks for healthcare workers during this pandemic, and currently has ~1% of that necessary volume.1 The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that clinicians save masks and reuse them, and clinicians are currently using N95 masks for full shifts.2 With each attempt to safely don a contaminated N95 mask, the risk for infection of vital clinicians grows. In countries where equipment shortages have progressed, healthcare workers are currently being infected with SARS-CoV-2 at 3 times the rate of the general population, which reduces the ability of hospitals to provide adequate care and increases COVID-19 patient death rates. Thus, it is essential to create a protocol for sanitizing masks without reducing efficacy.",

This design, while effective for reducing infection in clinicians, poses significant challenges for sanitization. Washing these masks with water decreased performance by 21%.3 Sanitizing N95 masks with alcohol similarly reduced performance by 37% and resulted in significant shrinkage.4 Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation has been tested for sanitization of N95 masks, but in 90% of cases, the integrity of the masks was compromised.5,6 Sanitization by bleach or ethylene oxide created significant risk to mask wearers due to residue left on the mask.6 Thus, novel methods of sanitizing N95 masks to ensure safety of clinicians working in factious disease units is needed.",
