            "text": "To gain entry into the target cell, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) uses its spike (S) protein S2 subunit to fuse with the plasma or endosomal membrane. Previous work identified a peptide derived from the heptad repeat (HR) 2 domain in S2 subunit, HR2P, which potently blocked MERS-CoV S protein-mediated membrane fusion. Here, we tested an HR2P analogue with improved pharmaceutical property, HR2P-M2, for its inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV infection in vitro and in vivo. HR2P-M2 was highly effective in inhibiting MERS-CoV S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and infection by pseudoviruses expressing MERS-CoV S protein with or without mutation in the HR1 region. It interacted with the HR1 peptide to form stable \u03b1-helical complex and blocked six-helix bundle formation between the HR1 and HR2 domains in the viral S protein. Intranasally administered HR2P-M2 effectively protected adenovirus serotype-5-human dipeptidyl peptidase 4-transduced mice from infection by MERS-CoV strains with or without mutations in the HR1 region of S protein, with >1000-fold reduction of viral titers in lung, and the protection was enhanced by combining HR2P-M2 with interferon \u03b2. These results indicate that this combination regimen merits further development to prevent MERS in high-risk populations, including healthcare workers and patient family members, and to treat MERS-CoV-infected patients.",

As of 25 May 2015, a total of 1139 laboratory-confirmed cases and 431 deaths had been reported to the World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/csr/don/25-may-2015-merssaudi-arabia/en/). The high case fatality rate among patients with MERS-CoV infection has caused widespread fear because the mode of transmission from zoonotic sources is not well understood, and coronaviruses have the potential to mutate, becoming more pathogenic and transmissible [1] [2] [3] [4] . Bats and dromedary camels are considered to be the natural reservoir and intermediate hosts for MERS-CoV, respectively, but most community-acquired cases are not associated with camel contact [5] [6] [7] [8] . Cumulative evidence from healthcare settings suggests that person-to-person transmission of MERS-CoV can occur through close contact [2, 9] . In the absence of an effective vaccine, it is essential to develop strategies to prevent camel-to-human and human-to-human transmission among high-risk populations, as well as to treat MERS-CoV-infected patients.",

After binding and proteolytic cleavage, a fusion peptide at the N-terminus of S2 is exposed and is inserted into the plasma or endosomal membrane. The heptad repeat (HR) 2 binds to the HR1 in S2 to form a six-helix bundle (6-HB) fusion core, which brings viral and cell membranes into close apposition for fusion [16] . Peptides derived from the HR2 region, such as HR2P, can also interact with HR1 domain in the viral S protein to form heterogeneous 6-HB and thus block viral fusion with host cell membranes [16] , as described elsewhere in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV infections [17] [18] [19] [20] .",

Both HR2P-M2 and HR2P strongly inhibited S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion in a dose-dependent manner, with IC 50 values of 0.55 and 0.97 \u00b5mol/L, respectively ( Figure 1B ), indicating that HR2P-M2 has improved membrane fusion inhibitory activity compared with HR2P. SARS CP-1 peptide did not inhibit MERS-CoV S-mediated cell-cell fusion at concentrations up to 20 \u00b5mol/L, confirming a previous observation by Lu et al [16] . The MERS-CoV S protein HR1 domain, the target site of HR2-derived peptides (eg, HR2P and HR2P-M2), has largely conserved sequences when different strains are compared. Among clinical MERS-CoV strains, only 1 amino acid change at position 1020 of the HR1 domain (Q1020H or Q1020R) (Figure 1A) was observed, and this was present in nearly all strains [29, 30] . To test whether HR2P-M2 was effective against these MERS-CoV strains, we compared the inhibitory activity of HR2P-M2 on cell-cell fusion mediated by MERS-CoV S protein, with or without Q1020H or Q1020R mutations. Surprisingly, HR2P-M2 was about 0.9-2.6-fold more potent in inhibiting cell-cell fusion mediated by MERS-CoV S protein bearing Q1020H and Q1020R, respectively, than the WT S protein of the EMC/2012 strain ( Figure 1C ).",

We then constructed pseudoviruses expressing MERS-CoV S protein with Q1020H or Q1020R mutations and compared their sensitivity with that of HR2P-M2.

As shown in Figure 3B , the sample containing only HR2P-F (lane 2) displayed a single fluorescence band located in the lower portion of the gel, whereas the mixture of HR1P and HR2P-F (lane 3) migrated more slowly. This band corresponded to 6-HB. When increasing concentrations of HR2P-M2 were incubated with HR1P at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes before addition of HR2P-F (lanes 4-6), the fluorescence intensity of the HR2P-F band gradually increased, whereas that of bands of the complexes corresponding to 6-HB decreased, suggesting that HR2P-M2 inhibited 6-HB formation between the HR1P and HR2P-F in a dose-dependent manner. Figure 4 , viral titers in the lungs of PBS-treated mice challenged with recombinant MERS-CoV carrying WT, Q1020R, or Q1020H S protein peaked at about 10 6 , 10 5 , and 10 5 PFUs/g, respectively. Strikingly, titers in the lungs of mice treated with HR2P-M2 and challenged with WT, Q1020R, and Q1020H MERS-CoV were decreased to 10 3 PFUs/g (WT) or below the limit of detection (Q1020R and Q1020H), representing >1000-fold reduction of viral titers in lung. The limit of detection of the viral titers in our assay was 10 2 PFUs/g, suggesting that mice intranasally treated with HR2P-M2 6 hours before challenge with MERS-CoV or its variants were highly protected from MERS-CoV infection. Studies using the HIV-specific peptide enfuvirtide demonstrated the emergence of resistance in the HR1 domain of HIV during prolonged exposure [32] . Therefore, to diminish the likelihood of this occurrence and to provide an additional layer of protection in the event of any emerging resistant virus, we included IFN-\u03b2 in our prophylactic and therapeutic regimens. IFN-\u03b2 potently inhibited MERS-CoV infection in cell culture [33] , and Zhao et al [27] showed previously that IFN-\u03b2 treatment, before or after MERS-CoV challenge, significantly accelerated the kinetics of virus clearance.",

This combination was also provided to several severely ill patients, and though it reduced the mortality rate 14 days after treatment, it did not show beneficial effects by 28 days, possibly because of late administration [35] . Ribavirin/IFN-a2b in combination with HR2P-M2 may diminish morbidity and mortality rates more successfully than either therapy alone. Recently, several compounds from Food and Drug Administration-approved drug libraries were reported to have inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV replication in cell culture [36, 37] . Liu et al demonstrated that some of these MERS-CoV replication inhibitors could inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis, but most of them did not inhibit MERS-CoV S protein-mediated membrane fusion, and none was able to inhibit 6-HB formation [38] . Therefore, these small-molecule MERS-CoV replication inhibitors seem to have mechanisms of action different from that of the peptide MERS-CoV fusion inhibitor HR2P [16] .",

Only a single change in the amino acid at position 1020 in the HR1 domain, namely, Q1020H or Q1020R mutations, has been reported [29, 30] . In the present study, we showed that the viruses expressing Q1020H or Q1020R actually grow less well in mouse lung, although they are still potently inhibited by HR2P-M2. Therefore, the peptide targeting the HR1 domain is expected to be effective against most MERS-CoV strains identified thus far.",

In the present study, we demonstrated that in mice intranasally treated with HR2P-M2 or IFN-\u03b2 alone or in combination 6 hours before viral challenge, viral titers in lung were significantly reduced in all treated groups, with complete clearance observed in mice treated with the IFN-\u03b2/HR2P-M2 combination ( Figure 5A ), verifying their in vivo efficacy for prophylactic treatment. We chose to deliver HR2P-M2 and IFN-\u03b2 intranasally because MERS is predominantly a respiratory tract infection. Because no autopsy or surgical specimens are available from patients with MERS, it is not known whether a clinically relevant infection occurs in other organs. Furthermore, MERS-CoV is released from the apical side of respiratory tract cells [40] . Therefore, peptide delivered intranasally would be maximal at the site of infection.",

Pathological changes in the lungs, such as perivascular, peribronchial and interstitial infiltration, as well as alveolar septa thickening, were moderately reduced in groups treated with IFN-\u03b2 or HR2P-M2 alone, with significant attenuation in the IFN-\u03b2/HR2P-M2-treated group ( Figure 5E ).",

Other than marmosets, no animals experimentally infected with MERS-CoV develop similar disease severity, to our knowledge. Once a widely available animal model of severe disease is developed, it will be important to test IFN-\u03b2/HR2P-M2 for prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy.
