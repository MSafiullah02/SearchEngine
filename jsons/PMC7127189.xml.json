To exclude other respiratory illnesses, subjects received chest X-ray screening before beginning treatment. The presence and severity of influenza symptoms, including cough, sore throat, nasal obstruction and rhinorrhoea, headache, fatigue, myalgia, thirst and chills, were recorded once daily using a four-point scale (0 absent, 1 mild, 2 moderate, and 3 severe). The first record was performed when the patient was admitted, and the next two records (on days 1 and 3 after treatment) were done in the morning. Influenza was confirmed by a direct immunofluorescent antibody assay (DFA) of nasopharyngeal swabs, which showed sensitivities of 89.7% for influenza A virus and 87.9% for influenza B virus and specificities of 99.3% for influenza A virus and 100% for influenza B virus.16 Treatment assignment was blinded during virological testing, which was done at West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu.",

According to Treatise on Cold-induced Diseases (Shang Han Lun), a variety of herbal formulas have been used to treat patients with infectious diseases for over 1800 years. Chinese medicine is widely accepted amongst Chinese populations. The use of Chinese medicine in treating pandemic and endemic diseases has long been described in traditional medical books such as Shang Han Lun, and Huangdi\u2019s Canon of Medicine (HuangDi Nei Jing). The prescriptions for infectious diseases were made based on the clinical presentations, rather than laboratory-confirmed pathogens, which were beyond their knowledge at that time. Only a small fraction of the thousands of medicinal plants used worldwide has been tested rigorously in randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Yet randomized, controlled trials are the best way to demonstrate the efficacy of any medical, herbal or conventional therapy.25 Although herbs or herbal products, as part of complementary and alternative therapies, have been proposed, their effectiveness in treating or preventing influenza has not been established beyond reasonable doubt.11 The extract of elderberry was used to treat the influenza in the past,26 and two studies have demonstrated a significant benefit of herbal products in prophylaxis against viral infection.27, 28 Herbal supplement users have also reported significant improvement in influenza-like symptoms such as chills, cough, fatigue, and headache and quality-of-life measures such as mental health score,27 as they have in our study.",

One recent study by Kubo T. et al. showed that there is a more antipyretic effect of Mao-to, a Japanese herbal medicine, for treatment of type A influenza infection in children, in comparison to Oseltamivir.29 The Japanese traditional herbal medicine includes Mahuang, Guizhi, Kuxingren and Gancao, which as components were included in Antiwei. In our study, the antipyretic effect was apparent within 24 h of Antiwei administration, when influenza symptoms are generally most troublesome. Although we did not assess economic effects, the indirect costs of influenza such as workplace absenteeism and performance at work could be improved according to the clinical benefits observed in the influenza-confirmed population and in the population with influenza-like illness.30\n",

No other adverse effects or abnormalities in laboratory test were associated with Antiwei treatment. It must be noted that the Antiwei contains Mahuang, which has been reported to have some side effects (such as chest pain, hypertension, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, stroke, or death32) when served as a dietary supplement for weight reduction and performance enhancement, but the use of Mahuang in this study was not associated with any significant adverse events. In our prescription, 6 g of Antiwei equals to 23 g of crude herbs, in which there is 2.5 g of Mahuang, so the daily dose of Mahuang was only 5.0 g, which is a small dosage compared with the conventional dose in other TCM treatments.",
