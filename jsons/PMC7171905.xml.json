The field has broadened to include social demography, which has a broader focus on economic, social, cultural, and biological factors, an important aspect of the New Public Health because of the vital role that risk factors, which are deeply affected by social conditions, play in health protection and disease prevention. Epidemiology measures the distribution, causes, control, and outcomes of disease in population groups. It provides the basic tools for quantification of the extent of disease, its patterns of change, and associated risk factors. Epidemiology also provides basic information needed for planning, evaluating, and managing health services. Other disciplines provide additional information and insights needed for community and national health assessment. These include the social sciences (sociology, psychology, anthropology, and economics), as well as clinical fields such as pediatrics and geriatrics, and basic sciences such as microbiology, immunology, and genetics.",

Fertility is a complex issue influenced by cultural, social, economic, religious, and even political factors. Although economic prosperity may initially promote higher birth rates, increases in education levels and economic prospects, as well as in survival of those born, are generally related to reduced birth rates and natural population growth (Box 3.2\n). Changes in the status of women, and sexual and reproductive health standards and methods have contributed to changing birth patterns and expectations of family size in evolving societies. In recent decades, new medical advances have led to in vitro fertilization methods becoming widely available in upper- and middle-income countries; these are now an option in some instances of infertility, as is surrogate motherhood.BOX 3.2Commonly Used Fertility Rates\n\u2022\nCrude birth rate (CBR) \u2013 the number of live births in a population over a given period, usually one calendar year, divided by the midyear population of the same jurisdiction, multiplied by 1000.\u2022\nTotal fertility rate (TFR) \u2013 the average number of children that a woman would bear if all women lived to the end of their childbearing years and bore children according to age-specific fertility rates; most accurately answering the question \u201chow many children does a woman have, on average?\u201d\nSource: Modified from Last JM, editor.

This is in contrast with the high ranking in Human Development Index (HDI) measures and the high level of expenditure on health. The reasons for this are debated: most attribute it to a lack of universal health coverage, but the regional variations in mortality rates seen in the USA suggest that the key issues include differences in diet and life habits.

The concept of \u201camenable\u201d or avoidable mortality is one approach shown to provide a useful approximation. Using this concept, previous work illustrated how health care impacted positively on population health in many industrialized countries during the 1980s and 1990s. However, the pace of change has differed among countries and over time.Recent work demonstrated, for example, that progress in the USA on this indicator was lagging behind other industrialized countries. The USA had a higher rate than European countries, that is, a higher rate of deaths from conditions such as diabetes or acute infection that could potentially have been treated with timely and effective care. In 2007, for example, US rates of such deaths were almost twice those in France, which had the lowest rates of the countries studied.The USA spends an average of nearly $8000 a year per person on health care \u2013 roughly double the average in Western European countries. Yet Americans die sooner and also experience poorer health throughout life than people in many other countries. While the USA enjoyed steady increases in the length of life during the twentieth century in particular, in the latter part it fell increasingly behind other high-income countries.This can be illustrated by recent trend in amenable mortality, comparing the USA with France, Germany, and the UK. Thus, between 1999 and 2007, the rate of potentially preventable deaths among men under the age of 75 fell by 18.5 percent in the USA compared to a 37 percent decline in the UK, a 28 percent decline in France, and a 24 percent decline in Germany. For women, the rates fell by 17.5 percent in the USA, compared to 32 percent in the UK, and 23 percent in both France and Germany.The lag in improvement was most notable among American men and women under the age of 65. These individuals are more likely to be uninsured than are Americans over 65, who are eligible for Medicare. The observed differences are not inevitable, however, and there are regional variations, as in all countries. For example, the state of Minnesota achieved outcomes on a par with those found in many European countries and an amenable mortality rate less than half that of Mississippi or the District of Columbia.Evidence indicates that these outcomes were achieved with patients receiving care that meets best practice guidelines and preventive care to reduce unneeded hospitalization. These findings underscore the importance of improving access to timely and effective health care in the USA. Amenable or avoidable mortality is an important tool for epidemiological monitoring and comparisons of population health between countries and between regions within countries.Sources: Nolte E, RAND Europe; McKee M, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

            "text": "Empirical documentation increased in Europe in the middle of the nineteenth century, concerning health, disease, and mortality, in the form of death certificates and mortality registers. The most influential events in establishing infectious disease epidemiology were the discovery by Edward Jenner in 1797 that vaccination with cowpox could prevent smallpox, Peter Panum\u2019s description of the spread of a measles epidemic in the Faroe Islands in 1846, and John Snow\u2019s and William Farr\u2019s successful analyses of the London cholera epidemic of the 1850s. James Lind\u2019s classic case-controlled experiment showing the nutritional cause of scurvy in 1847 opened up the field of nutritional epidemiology; and the work of Edwin Chadwick and William Farr concerning social inequity in mortality and on classification of causes of death initiated social epidemiology. Farr observed that \u201cHunger destroys a much higher proportion than is indicated by the registers in this and every other country, but its effects, like the effects if excess, are generally manifested indirectly in the production of disease of various kinds\u201d (Whitehead, 2000). Ramazzini\u2019s work in occupational health and Percivall Pott\u2019s identification of cancer of the scrotum among chimney sweeps opened up new areas of epidemiological investigation. Ignaz Semmelweis improved maternal health by documenting the causes of high neonatal mortality in a maternity ward, identifying a lack of hand washing by medical doctors as the culprit. These pioneers set the stage for infectious disease, NCD, occupational, women\u2019s health, maternity, and social epidemiology (see Chapter 1).",

            "text": "Epidemiology proved itself in enormously successful interventions for public health in the first half of the nineteenth century. The golden period of infectious disease epidemiology in the late nineteenth and first half of the twentieth centuries established the basis for control of communicable disease, a revolution still in process. During the mid-twentieth century, the development of non-infectious epidemiology and social epidemiology provided the basis for health promotion and lifestyle changes contributing to reduced morbidity and mortality from CVD and the potential for control of cancer, trauma, and other non-communicable conditions. In the case of HIV/AIDS, health promotion was the only tool available until the antiretroviral drugs became available, but the hoped-for vaccine is still in the future. There is an important role for controlled trials for preventive modalities and treatment in relation to chronic disease (mammography, hormone therapy, and many others). Highlights of the development of modern epidemiological methods are discussed in Box 3.6\n.BOX 3.6Highlights of the Development of Modern Epidemiological MethodsEarly twentieth century theoretical developments of epidemiology included contributions of Ronald Fisher and others from the 1920s onwards creating the foundations for modern statistical science. Multivariate analysis methods enabled epidemiological concurrent analysis of various potential health risk factors. Karl Popper\u2019s work on the logic of scientific discovery, published in German in the 1930s, reached wide recognition after publication in English in 1959. It provided a philosophical theory of science and a basis for academic epidemiology.Since the mid-twentieth century, epidemiological activity has grown gradually and substantially, so that today\u2019s epidemiological research production is breathtaking compared to the situation just a few decades ago. Cancer, tuberculosis, birth defect, and heart and other disease registries have been developed, which are the data basis for epidemiological analysis. Population cohorts were established and followed for years. Cancer and cardiovascular epidemiology developed to become major fields. The etiologies of most large disease categories were a productive sphere of epidemiological methods, including mental disease prevalence studies (see Chapters 4\u20139Chapter 4Chapter 5Chapter 6Chapter 7Chapter 8Chapter 9).An early breakthrough in modern epidemiology was the 1954 publication of the British Doctors\u2019 study by Doll and Hill, showing a strong association between smoking and lung cancer. In the first part of the 1980s, the interaction between developments in immunology and developments in epidemiological methods and in biostatistics resulted in the identification of HIV as the infectious cause of AIDS.Major theoretical, methodological, practical, and organizational developments have taken place in the last half-century. In 1960, MacMahon, Pugh, and Ipsen published their groundbreaking theory, the \u201cWeb of Causation\u201d, moving epidemiology from monocausality to multicausality, so that it came work with other sciences in etiological studies. In 1964, Bradford Hill published his 10 criteria for causality. Increasing development of the logical foundation of epidemiological designs, as well as theoretical development, included more precise and consistent validity and bias concepts, such as:\u2022cohort designs (\u201cprospective\u201d), fixed and open, dynamic\u2022case\u2013control (\u201cretrospective\u201d), case\u2013referent, case\u2013base designs\u2022quasi-experimental designs\u2022experimental designs and randomized controlled population experiments, inspired by the work of Cochrane.\nInteraction between the development of theory, principles and methods in epidemiology and biostatistics increased, especially from the 1970s onwards. Discriminant analysis and other types of discrete analysis of central importance for epidemiological thought and documentation were developed, e.g., multiple logistic regression, multilevel logistic regression, Cox regression, Poisson regression, longitudinal analysis, structured equation modeling, Markov chains and processes, and multidimensional methods for forecasting.Clinical epidemiology developed as a discipline in the last part of the twentieth century, applying population-epidemiological methods to patient populations. Modern technology opens new perspectives in epidemiology, including genetic epidemiology, with the use of disease, occupation, and population registries linking individual data on health and health services consumption with social conditions (e.g., education, occupation, employment, and family structure), economy, and residence. With lifelong follow-up, this makes possible large-scale, multidimensional, observational population (and patient) studies, which are suitable for the study of rare diseases \u2013 as well as quasi-experimental estimation of effects of structural and dynamic interventions in health systems and other systems.The World Health Organization pioneered multiple-country databases, such as WHO Europe\u2019s Health for All Database (HFA-DB), publicly accessible on the Internet, which includes major health indicators for European countries since the 1970s. Such databases are vital tools for education and policy analysis to inform national and international health policies.Sources: Foldspang A, Aarhus University. Personal communication.Saracci R.

Evaluation is a more formal and systematic approach in determining the quality of the health of a population as objectively as possible. All evaluations need to look at the input, process, and output of a system.

These measures are also related to disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) combining morbidity, impact on longevity, and quality of life or disability (see Chapter 11) (Box 3.9\n).\nBOX 3.9Measures of Frequency of Disease in a Population\nRate=NumberofcasesinagiventimeperiodPopulationatriskinthesametimeperiod\u00d7Nthwhere N\nth\n = 100, 1000, 10,000, 100,000, or 1,000,000; Period: usually = 1 year; Population: mid-year (1 July) estimate.\u2022\nIncidence rate \u2013 the rate at which new health-related events occur in a population.

The prevalence rate (or rather the prevalence proportion) is the number of individuals with the attribute divided by the population at risk, at that point in time (point prevalence). Period prevalence usually is defined as the sum of (a) the point prevalence at the beginning of the period, plus (b) the cumulative incidence during the period.\u2022\nAttack rate \u2013 the cumulative number of cases of a specified disease among the population known to be exposed to that disease over a defined period.\nSource: Modified from Last JM, editor.

In that case, the average size of the population in the specified period is used as the denominator, usually including both the \u201cpopulation at risk\u201d and cases already with the disease (prevalence). Although only the \u201cpopulation at risk\u201d should theoretically be included, such an approximation is often made. The reason for this is that when the condition is relatively rare, the influence that prevalence cases will have over the denominator can be considered negligible. In addition, the information about prevalence cases is often not available.\u2022\nCumulative incidence rate is usually calculated in longitudinal epidemiological studies. When a cohort (a group of people), initially free from the disease, is being followed during a certain period, incidence cases can be identified as they occur. The sum of those incidence cases is referred to as \u201ccumulative incidence\u201d. Here, the denominator includes only the \u201cpopulation at risk\u201d; therefore, cumulative incidence may also be termed risk of the condition (Abramson, 2001).\u2022\nPerson\u2013time incidence rate or incidence density is usually used in follow-up studies in which individuals are \u201cat risk\u201d or may be followed up during different periods. In this case, the total number of events is divided by the sum of all subjects\u2019 periods at risk, measured, for example, in years, months, or days. In order to calculate the denominator, each individual\u2019s \u201cperiod at risk\u201d must be calculated, measuring the time from the beginning of the follow-up until withdrawal from the study (due to either occurrence of the condition under study, or \u201ccensoring\u201d; i.e., any other reason causing cessation of follow-up).\n",

Burden of disease measures are used to assess the cost-effectiveness of specific interventions (see Glossary).BOX 3.12Measures of the Burden of Disease\n\u2022\nPotential years of life lost (PYLL) \u2013 PYLL is a measure of the relative impact of various diseases and lethal forces on society. It highlights the loss to society as a result of youthful or early deaths. The figure for PYLL due to a particular cause is the sum, over all people dying of that cause, of the years that these people would have lived had they reached a specified age.\u2022\nDisability-adjusted life year (DALY) \u2013 DALYs are units for measuring the global burden of disease and the effectiveness of health interventions and changes in living conditions. The DALY is a summary measure of population health. DALYs are calculated as the present value of future years of disability-free life that are lost as a result of premature death or disability occurring in a particular year.DALYs are calculated by a formula that includes five main components: the duration of time lost due to a death at each age, disability weights, age weights, time preference (expressed as a discounting function), and the integration of health measures among a population.DALYs for a disease or health condition are calculated as the sum of the years of life lost (YLL) due to premature mortality in the population and the years of healthy life lost from some degree of disability (YLD) for incident cases of the health condition.For detailed procedures on how to calculate DALYs, see WHO (2001, 2010).\n\u2022\nQuality-adjusted life year (QALY) \u2013 QALYs are an adjustment or reduction of life expectancy reflecting chronic conditions, disability, or handicap, derived from survey, hospital discharge, or other data. Numerical weighting of severity of disability is established on the basis of patient and health professional judgment.\nSources: Last JM, editor. A dictionary of public health.

The appropriate choice of the study population is crucial to ensure that the results obtained from the study can later be generalized to the general population. Therefore, a sample must be selected randomly, representative of the general population, and of sufficient size as to increase the likelihood (or probability) that the results obtained from the sample are close enough to the actual situation in the general population (i.e., where the level of significance of a statistical test is acceptable) (Box 3.14\n).BOX 3.14Sample SizePrinciples\n\u2022Samples are drawn to represent a population and the larger the number of samples and their sizes, the higher the probability that their average value (of the parameter under study) is equal to the value in the population.\u2022Because sample sizes are limited, sampling error (i.e., the probable difference between the value in the sample and in the population) must always be taken into account.\u2022The size of the sampling error is affected by the size of the sample drawn, and by other factors, some of which are called biases. Increasing the sample size decreases the size of the sampling error, unless there is a selection bias, in which case increasing the size will sustain the sampling error.\u2022The principles of sampling rest on the assumption that samples are randomly obtained.\nFactors in the Calculation of Sample Size\n\u2022\nType 1 error \u2013 the risk of a false positive result (\u03b1) (i.e., the chance of detecting a statistically significant difference when there is no real difference).\u2022\nType 2 error \u2013 the risk of a false negative result (\u03b2) (i.e., the likelihood of not detecting a significant difference when there really is a difference that is greater than the specified threshold).\nThe power of a study is its ability to demonstrate an association if one exists. It is determined by several factors, including the frequency of the condition under study, the magnitude of the effect, the study design, and sample size. It is defined as the chance of not getting a false-negative result and is equal to 1 \u2212 \u03b2 (type 2 error).Calculation of sample size is beyond the scope of this text and is found in free computer programs, including those in the Sources below.Sources: Last JM, editor.

Many epidemiological prospective studies follow selected population groups, such as the long-term prospective study of nurses conducted by Walter Willett at the Harvard School of Public Health, providing a major source of new information on the health of women. This is the largest cohort study of women, tracking over 120,000 nurses since 1976.",

Special surveys become important as the follow-up to initial findings. Intervention can then be planned on the basis of these investigations. An example review of vital statistics in New York State (1987) showed 32 infant deaths reported during the 1980s attributed to Vitamin K Deficiency Bleeding (VKDB), then called Hemorrhagic Disease of Newborne (HDN), a disease preventable by prophylactic vitamin K injections of newborns.A study of the State Hospital Discharge Information system showed a substantial number of hospital discharges with the diagnosis of HDN (first to fourth diagnosis) during the same period. A case record review conducted of infant deaths with VKDB, then known as Hemorrhagic Disease of Newborn (HDN) as a diagnosis (first to fourth diagnosis). Two-thirds of the cases did not receive vitamin K at all, or not until after bleeding had already begun. None of the 22 hospitals in which these cases occurred had standing orders for vitamin K injections for newborns. Up to that time, five states had mandatory vitamin K requirements for newborns and is standard practice since first recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 1961.As a result, the New York State Department of Health adopted mandatory vitamin K prophylaxis for newborns. Record linkage between hospitalization data and the individual cases would have made such a study more readily achievable. This study led to adoption of mandatory vitamin K injection for all infants in New York State and subsequently in all US states. No cases of mortality from this condition were reported in 2011 and 2012. In 2013, 4 cases of late VKDB were reported in a childrens\u2019 hospital in Tennessee due to mothers refusal to give vitamin K to their newborns.

The WHO estimates that tens of millions of such events occur annually without registration or reporting. At the same time, the understaffed primary care services compile daily records with large amounts of indigestible data on ambulatory care utilization. Scarce financial and personnel resources should instead be focused on more significant and higher quality data associated with hospitalizations. Fewer centers are involved in hospital care than in ambulatory care, so that data retrieval is easier to control. Most importantly, the less common event of hospitalization is medically and epidemiologically more significant because it consumes 40\u201375 percent of health care financing. A UHDIS may be seen as a priority information system after the reporting of infectious diseases, mortality, cancer, and birth defects.",

They may be used for performance monitoring and indeed administrative payment systems to encourage their complete implementation. Examples of performance indicators for payment include immunization coverage, Pap smears, and mammograms for patients registered with British general practitioners.The concept of health targets has become an essential element of US public health policy with Healthy People 2020 at the federal level with state compliance with such measures.

A conceptual framework is often applied to keep the research directed and dictates the combination of questions asked such as ones based on experiences, behaviors, opinions, values, concerns, or knowledge. Qualitative research should be dynamic, using questions and approaches that evolve as new insights are gained. Approaches to data collection can take the form of words, images, and observations; observation, in-depth interviews, and focus groups are the fundamental approaches to qualitative research. Other methods, such as documentary research and videotaping, can also play an important role in gaining participants\u2019 perspectives.",

Researchers often visit common meeting places, chat with potential participants, and then select a sample purposively based on readiness of individuals to participate, as well as their demographic characteristics to represent a defined subgroup. Sampling can be varied and, depending on strategy, may select homogeneous, heterogeneous, extreme, or typical participants.

            "text": "Information is the basis for planning, organizing, managing, and providing high-quality care. The process begins with basic vital statistics and the epidemiology of infectious and non-infectious diseases to identify and quantify the health needs of the population. It extends into health information systems to manage and monitor the functioning of the health care system. Surveillance of health events at national, regional, and community levels depends on building information systems and linking data to provide community health profiles. This process is fundamental to monitoring and managing health systems. It requires clear policy to ensure that information systems do not exist to serve only those who process the data at national levels, but are returned to the community level and linked with other data sources in readily usable formats (Box 3.28\n).BOX 3.28Evidence-Based Public Health and the Burden of ProofThe Hippocratic Oath specifies: do good and do no harm. It has found expression in the precautionary principle, a contemporary redefinition of Bradford Hill\u2019s case for action; when in doubt about the possible presence of a hazard, the burden of proof is shifted from showing presence of risk to showing total absence of risk. This creates a dilemma in public health and in clinical medicine suggesting that the normal evidence required for action is without validity. It implies that any possible risk of an intervention outweighs the risk of non-intervention.Great care is warranted when introducing new public health interventions, but the weight of evidence must include not only epidemiological studies but policies derived from Delphi consultative procedures and successful experience of the intervention in large population groups over long periods, without substantive evidence of harmful effect.A balance between the precautionary principle, the experience of \u201cgood public health practice\u201d and epidemiological evidence is often a delicate judgment, but is nonetheless essential for policy in this field. Last\u2019s definition of evidence-based public health is wise: \u201capplication of best available experience in setting public health policies and priorities. The evidence comes from official vital and health statistics and from peer reviewed publications in epidemiology, sociology, economics and other relevant disciplines\u201d.Failure to act on best practices and cumulative evidence can be an ethical and indeed a legal problem (see Chapter 15), where inordinate delay in implementing scientific and practical positive experience with public health interventions can allow serious morbidity and mortality to go unchecked when they are preventable.The time lag between adequate scientific evidence and positive experience with good public health practices can be very long, and measures that can save or improve the quality of life for large numbers of people are delayed in implementation due to lack of political motivation, priorities, and active or passive resistance by professional or lobby groups with other agendas.Delays in the adoption of a two-dose policy for measles vaccination and slow implementation in some developing countries have cost millions of lives. The implementation of folic acid fortification of flour has been slow, despite overwhelming evidence and positive experience in over 60 countries showing that folic acid fortification prevents birth defects and late pregnancy terminations with low cost and great safety. The banning of DDT in the 1960s due to legitimate environmental concerns without replacement of equally effective insecticides contributed to the resurgence of malaria, again costing millions of lives. Keeping up with scientific and best public health practices is an important responsibility of public health in balance with due precaution.As Brownson et al. (2009) point out, \u201cAn array of effective interventions is now available from numerous sources including the Guide to Community Preventive Services, the Guide to Clinical Preventive Services, Cancer Control PLANET, and the National Registry of Evidence-based Programs and Practices: Second, to translate science to practice, we need to marry information on evidence-based interventions from the peer-reviewed literature with the realities of a specific real-world environment. Finally, wide-scale dissemination of interventions of proven effectiveness must occur more consistently at state and local levels.\u201dJacobs et al. (2012) address the \u201cfree online resources in the following topic areas: training and planning tools, US health surveillance, policy tracking and surveillance, systematic reviews and evidence-based guidelines, economic evaluation, and gray literature. Key elements of EBPH are engaging the community in assessment and decision making; using data and information systems systematically; making decisions on the basis of the best available peer-reviewed evidence (both quantitative and qualitative); applying program-planning frameworks (often based in health-behavior theory); conducting sound evaluation; and disseminating what is learned.\u201dSources: Last JM.
