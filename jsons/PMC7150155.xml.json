Like a physician, a diagnostic expert system begins by collecting information about the patient's illness\u2014 symptoms, observations from physical examination, results from laboratory tests, risk factors for disease (e.g., travel to a foreign country) and pre-existing medical conditions (e.g., diabetes). We refer to this diagnostic information collectively as the findings. Of course, the computer usually does not interview the patient and (at present) never examines the patient. Rather, a physician interviews and examines the patient after which she or an assistant enters the findings into the program (e.g., Warner and Bouhaddou, 1994, London, 1998, Buchanan and Shortliffe, 1984, Miller et al., 1986, Shwe et al., 1991, Heckerman et al., 1992). Increasingly, diagnostic expert systems acquire findings automatically from clinical information systems (Aronsky et al., 2001, Burnside et al., 2004, McDonald et al., 1991). There are also examples of diagnostic expert systems that interview patients directly to obtain their medical histories (Pynsent and Fairbank, 1989, Wald et al., 1995).",

Many readers will be quite familiar and comfortable with the concept of sensitivity and specificity of laboratory tests, but perhaps not with the idea of sensitivity and specificity of other findings. In fact, symptoms, travel history, results of physical examination, and results of laboratory tests are all nothing more than observations that we make about an individual that may help us discriminate between individuals with disease and those without disease. It is possible to measure a sensitivity, specificity (or, alternatively, likelihood ratios) for any of these diagnostic observations. Consider the diseases presented in mini-BOSSS. Cattle affected with FMD develop very severe mouth vesicles and ulcers. This mouth pain results in excessive salivation; therefore, it causes drooling of saliva. Cattle affected with MCD do not develop mouth wounds; therefore, they are not likely to be observed drooling saliva. The conditional probabilities in Table 13.2 reflect the observations above; P(drooling of saliva|FMD) is equal to 0.95 and p(drooling of saliva|MCD) is equal to 0.001.",

If we had a positive result from a highly sensitive and specific test for FMD (very high LR+), the posterior odds for FMD might be quite high.

They began to explore methods to embed diagnostic expert systems\u2014 providing diagnostic support and, more generally, decision support\u2014to clinicians without asking them to enter patient findings. Their research demonstrated that it is possible to obtain needed findings directly from existing clinical information systems (Evans, 1991, Gardner et al., 1999, Rind et al., 1993, Rind et al., 1995, McDonald, 1976c, McDonald et al., 1992a, McDonald, 1976b, McDonald et al., 1992b, Overhage et al., 1996, Wagner et al., 1997) and from alterations in work flow, such as replacing unstructured paper records with computer-generated encounter forms (from which findings can be optically scanned or manually extracted) (McDonald, 1976a, McDonald et al., 1992a, McDonald, 1976b, McDonald et al., 1992b). The research also demonstrated how diagnostic expert systems can be embedded in clinical information systems, such as physician order entry systems (Tierney et al., 1993, Dexter et al., 2001) and electronic medical records (Gardner et al., 1999, Warner et al., 1997). Several of these systems functioned in the domain of hospital infection control (Hripcsak et al., 1997, Hripcsak et al., 1999, Kahn et al., 1996a, Kahn et al., 1996b, Kahn et al., 1993).",

PANDA is pursuing this idea on a citywide scale. Conceptually, a PANDA network comprises millions of person-specific diagnostic Bayesian networks, each of whose probabilities of disease (e.g., anthrax) are being influenced by population-level observations (e.g., aggregate sales of over-the-counter medications) and population-level inferences (e.g., the likelihood that other individuals who may have inhalational anthrax are present in a population). PANDA also includes a prior probability distribution over outbreak diseases (e.g, the prior probability of inhalational anthrax, based on the national terror alert level). By integrating person-specific diagnostic submodels into a population-wide super model, approaches like PANDA are able to make inferences about the probability of a disease outbreak in the population as a whole, as well as the probability of disease in individual people (or subgroups of people) within the population.",

The authors of the SARS case definition intended it for use by physicians and epidemiologists, not computers. The clause \u201cfindings of lower respiratory illness (e.g., cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing)\u201d does not enumerate all findings of lower respiratory illness. A computer requires a complete enumeration of all findings that it should count as evidence of lower respiratory illness (e.g., cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, wheezing, cyanosis, tachypnea, dullness to percussion, fremitus, whispered pectoriloquy, rales, and rhonchi). The findings would also have to be described more precisely. For example, a physician or an epidemiologist would not count chronic cough or cough associated with asthma as a finding of lower respiratory illness when applying this case definition, but a computer would (unless told otherwise). Note that it is difficult, if not impossible, to enumerate all of the possible exceptions to the counting of a finding as evidence of a disease. This difficulty is the reason that diagnostic expert systems in medicine are probabilistic. They quantify the number of exceptions to a categorical statement about the relationship between findings and disease using probabilities. For example, 70% of patients with cough have an acute lower respiratory illness, but 30% (the exceptions) have some other cause. This observation suggests that computer-interpretable case definitions will employ Bayesian networks, as illustrated by Figure 13.15\n.",
