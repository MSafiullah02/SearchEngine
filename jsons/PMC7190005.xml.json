This property has been abundantly exploited by human communities since they invented agriculture and breeding. Our ancestors have thus generated the essential of the varieties and races available and used by human beings. These heavily selected species are used as a source of food as well as pets or ornamental plants. The transformations which occurred during genetic selection are so deep that a number of domesticated species would not survive without the assistance of humans. Silkworm which has become unable to move, to find its food and sexual partners is illustrating this fact.",

In the best cases, this leads to the generation of new lines of animals showing various abnormalities mimicking more or less human diseases.

Interestingly, a project which started recently aims at sequencing the whole genome of 15 mouse strains. These strains have been chosen among those which show the largest biological diversity.

Up to 1\u20133% of mouse microinjected embryos commonly become transgenic animals. This yield can be significantly enhanced by using mouse strains like FVB/N (Auerbach et al. 2003). For unknown reasons, this yield is lower or much lower in rabbits, rats, pigs and ruminants respectively. This is not because of microinjection per se but to the integration process.

They may be located in a single region forming a barrier insulating a locus from its neighbours (Bell et al. 2001). It seems however that in most, if not all cases, quite distant elements participate to the insulator effects. The regulatory elements of a gene may be separated from its promoter by one or several non\u2010related genes. Thanks to a looping process, the distant regulatory elements associated to the corresponding transcription factors move to the promoter region forming a hub which induces histone hyperacetylation and a local opening of chromatin. This allows the transcription machinery to express the gene (De Laat and Grosveld 2003). These dynamic modifications of chromatin conformation more and more appear not only as mechanisms controlling gene expression but also as mechanisms of differentiation. The study of albumin gene illustrates this point. This gene is in closed chromatin conformation in early embryo. It becomes open specifically in endoderm and remains so until hepatocyte differentiation. It remains closed in the other differentiated cells (Lomvardas and Thanos 2002).",

Excess of growth hormone fragilizes the animals and shortens their life. In a second step, the rapidly growing fish released in sea water might be responsible for a local extinction of the species. Although not very likely, this scenario cannot be ignored and, up to now, the regulation agencies did not accept the breeding of fast\u2010growing fish using the current techniques. Complete isolation of fish farms or sterilization of the animals would solve the problem.
