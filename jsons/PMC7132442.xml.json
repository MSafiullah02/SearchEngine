The first outbreak occurred in the Prince of Wales Hospital on March 10, 2003, resulting in 138 cases.1 This was followed by the second major outbreak, which occurred in the Amoy Gardens housing estate at around March 26, 2003, affecting a total of 321 residents.3 The highest number of new cases per day was reported on March 31, 2003. Quarantine measures for family members of SARS cases were implemented on April 1, 2003 and the WHO issued a travel advisory against Hong Kong on April 2, 2003. The epidemic can thus be seen as reaching its peak on April 1, 2003.4 It has also been reported that mood disorders have been common in the general population during the SARS epidemic.5\n",

In addition, other epidemics or bioterrorism may also occur in the future. It is important to understand the mental health impacts of such disasters fully. A number of studies on post-traumatic stress symptoms have been documented in the United States, Japan, France and Israel.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 For the SARS epidemic, there are yet few studies focusing on the mental health aspects of community responses. In fact, little data have been obtained to understand how people cope with major disasters. Kinship support has been shown to be an important way to cope with the stress arising from the September 11 disaster9 and other positive coping behaviours, such as information search, social support13 and professional services seeking,14 etc., have also been documented. Studies show that post-traumatic growth is possible but there is scant information obtained on this topic.15, 16 Relevant research is warranted.",

Its devastations may be comparable to the September 11 experience in the United States and disasters occurred in other countries. Another report showed that noticeable proportions of the respondents in Hong Kong were having moderate or severe post-traumatic stress symptoms.17 Over 2/3 of the respondents felt horrified or apprehensive due to SARS; a high percentage felt helpless or worried themselves/their family members would contract the virus. Other negative mental health impacts, such as increased frequencies of sleeping problems, smoking and drinking, were also documented by that paper.17 Further, increased family stress and financial stress have been reported both during and after the SARS period in Hong Kong18 and many people avoided going out.4 In such circumstances, people might feel irritable and isolated, which might result in worsened family and social relationships. It is also possible that such stressful circumstances would lead to avoidance behaviours, such as avoidance of information seeking or developing more passive lifestyle. Societal capacity to recover from the crisis would then have been compromised.",

Importantly, better family and social support, better mental health awareness and healthier lifestyle have been documented by noticeable proportion of respondents.18 Although in many cases, more than half of the respondents reported no changes, the percentages reporting favourable changes were much larger than the percentages reporting unfavourable changes.18 The better social and family support observed was in line with intensive media coverage depicting a more coherent and harmonious atmosphere in Hong Kong.28, 29 Family and friends were much valued in this crisis. Family members were more likely to be spending time together with each other as they worried about and avoided going to public places.4 Family members also worried about each other being infected.4 Friends were sending warm regards to each other. Support, especially to those working under the threat of SARS transmission (e.g. health care workers) had been experienced through all sorts of media channels. The entire society slowed down with people avoiding work and public places. Therefore, with the above observation, it is speculated that due to the SARS epidemic, people may have had more time and opportunities to care for their family members and friends.",

            "text": "The study has several limitations. The study is a cross-sectional one, carried out at the ending phase of the SARS epidemic. As discussed, causality relationships could not be established and the positive changes may not last. Collection of baseline measurements was not possible for the pre-SARS period. Therefore, only perceived changes were measured. This is a self-reported study and presentation bias may have confounded the results. However, with the anonymous nature and the large magnitude of self-reported positive mental health-related changes, it is believed that the changes reported were genuine. Recall bias may have been incurred. Yet, the SARS epidemic is an unusual experience and should have created strong impressions in the mind of the respondents. The response rate was only about 65% and no data were available to understand the characteristics of the non-respondents. The age and gender composition however, is roughly comparable with those of the 2005 Census data (see Table 1 footnotes), and the response rate has been typical in surveys carried out in Hong Kong and has been found acceptable in a number of published papers.22, 35 Telephone surveys have been used in a number of studies on post-traumatic stress symptoms related to the 9-11 crisis.36, 37 It is in fact, the method of choice at the time of the study when SARS was a concern for everyone and contacts with strangers were minimised, so that face-to-face household interviews were not feasible at all. Those with stress may be more likely to refuse joining the study but the magnitude should be small as there is no evidence that those who are stressed did not want to be interviewed. The age range (18\u201360 years) also did not allow our results to be generalized to the younger and elderly age groups. It is also important to recognise that the correlation coefficients in Table 6, thought statistically significant, were only mild or moderate in magnitude. A large part of the variance in positive changes had not been accounted for by the IES. Finally, as SARS is a new disease and the study was implemented at the early ending phase of the epidemic. No relevant instrument existed and full validation was not available. Two scales have been constructed for this study and were used for a supplementary purpose. Though the MHRCS has a Cronbach's alpha value of 0.82, the Cronbach's alpha value of the PSS was moderate (0.66). However, the analysis using indicator variables gives consistent results (Table 5).",
