Host has evolved deliberated antiviral immune system to eliminate the invading virus. In mammalian cells, thousands of proteins participate in the innate and adaptive antiviral immunity. Although the protein\u2010mediated antiviral mechanisms have been established for many years, the exquisite immune regulation network to provide appropriate protection with minimal inflammatory damage is still not fully understood. Compared with microRNAs, which are well\u2010known noncoding RNA regulators of immune genes, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly recognized key components of the complicated antiviral immune system.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n",

Based on their genomic locations relative to adjacent protein\u2010coding genes, lncRNAs are classified as sense, antisense, bidirectional, intronic, and intergenic lncRNAs. Previously considered as \u2018junk\u2019 in the genome, but lncRNAs are recently recognized as critical regulators in various cellular processes.3, 5, 10, 11, 12 The lncRNA genes occupy the majority of pervasively transcribed genomes in human or mouse cells.13 The current GENCODE releases have annotated 15,931 human lncRNA genes (Version 23) and 8359 mouse lncRNA genes (Version M6).14 However, as of July 2015 only a small portion of human and mouse lncRNAs (181 and 114, respectively) have been experimentally characterized as functional RNAs as provided by lncRNAdb.15 Therefore, the functioning of the most lncRNAs remains largely unknown. Recently, increasing evidences have confirmed the crucial roles of lncRNAs in host antiviral response.7, 8, 9, 16, 17 The broad spectrum of activities and versatile regulatory mechanisms of lncRNAs suggest that lncRNAs are key regulators of host immunity during viral infection. For example, NeST RNA is found to epigenetically regulate the transcription of its neighboring IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010encoding gene.8 This finding provides novel insights into complicated mechanisms underlying regulation of IFN\u2010\u03b3. However, although the functional lncRNAs involved in antiviral innate immunity are explosively accumulated, limited information is available about lncRNAs associated with adaptive immunity. In this review, we will highlight the lncRNAs associated with viral infection, especially focusing on the expression of lncRNAs regulated by virus or host antiviral signaling, together with their functions and underlying mechanisms in the antiviral immunity.",

            "text": "lncRNAs are an important new class of regulators in a wide range of cellular activities. For example, they are involved in metastasis (HOTAIR),18 X\u2010chromosome imprint (XIST),19 development (Airn),20 stem cell pluripotency (HOTTIP),21 and immune response (lincRNA\u2010Cox2).22 Small regulatory noncoding microRNA (about 19\u201325 nt in length) also participate in many cellular activities. The silencing mechanism of microRNA is to modulate the mRNA degradation or translation via base\u2010pairing of the target mRNA with specific sequences.23 In comparison with these small ncRNAs, lncRNAs have multiple and flexible mechanisms mediated by their specific sequences or structural motifs that bind with DNA, RNA or protein.2, 12, 24, 25, 26 They act as signals, decoys, guides, and scaffolds to regulate different processes, ranging from chromatin remodeling, transcription, splicing, mRNA stabilization, protein translation to protein translocation (described in details by several reviews).1, 2, 12, 25, 26 It is well\u2010known that lncRNA HOTAIR epigenetically represses the gene transcription by acting as a scaffold that is involved in recruiting the Polycomb repression complex 2 (PRC2) responsible for the H3K27 methylation, and the LSD1 complex responsible for the H3K4me2 demethylation.18, 24 A recent study reveals that lncRNA NeST critically regulates IFN\u2010\u03b3 transcription by recruiting the WDR5 and MLL/Ash2L/RbBP5 complex to enhance the H3K4me3 modification.8 Moreover, it has been shown that lncRNA THRIL and lincRNA\u2010Cox2 regulate the transcription of TNF\u2010\u03b1 and CCL5, respectively through binding with hnRNP L and hnRNP A/B and A2/B1.22, 27 Interestingly, some lncRNAs, such as NRON and lnc\u2010DC, regulate transcription by modulating the activities of transcription factors. NRON\u2013protein complex binds transcription factor NFAT in cytoplasm and thus releases activated NFAT for nuclear transportation after stimulation.28 lnc\u2010DC acts to maintain the phosphorylation state of transcription factor STAT3 and increase its nuclear entry.29 In addition, some lncRNAs regulate gene expression at post\u2010transcription level. For example, lncRNA BACE1\u2010AS stabilizes BACE1 mRNA by forming a dsRNA complex through base\u2010pairing.30 With the help of translation inhibitor Rck, lincRNA\u2010p21 suppresses translation through partially base\u2010pairing with target mRNAs.31 lncRNA\u2010BGL3 functions as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for binding microRNAs to regulate PTEN expression.32 On the other hand, it is also worth to note that recent studies provided evidences that putative lncRNAs might harbour small ORFs and can be translated into functional micropeptides.33, 34 Therefore, it is important to determine the coding\u2010capacity when a novel lncRNA is identified. lncRNAs are the key component of regulatory network maintaining cellular homeostasis, and the dysfunction of lncRNAs is associated with many diseases, such as cancers, degenerative disorders, autoimmune, and viral diseases.5, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 27, 32, 35, 36\n",

            "text": "Viral infection of host cells causes viral diseases and also triggers host antiviral innate immune response. Enveloped virus enters the cell membrane through receptor\u2010mediated endocytosis, followed by viral genome release into the cytoplasm. Then viral genome utilizes cellular machinery and viral enzymes to replicate and assemble new progeny virions. After virus invasion, host cells can quickly sense viral components, known as pathogen\u2010associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), through pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) on the cell surface [Toll\u2010like receptor (TLR) 2 and 4], on the membrane of endosome (TLR 3,7/8, and 9), or within the cytoplasm (RIG\u2010I, MDA5, DAI, and NLRs) (see Figure 1).37, 38 PRR\u2010dependent signaling pathways activate transcription factors (TFs) such as IRF3, IRF7, and NF\u2010\u03baB. After the nuclear import of these TFs, robust interferons (IFNs), chemokines, and other cytokines are expressed. In turn, IFNs bind with their corresponding receptors, leading to the activation of JAK\u2010STAT signaling. After the nuclear translocation of phosphorylated STATs, they mediate formation of the transcription complex ISGF3 (STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9) that initiates the expression of hundreds of IFN\u2010stimulated genes (ISGs).37 In addition to the activation of signaling and TFs, the open state of chromatin and the mRNA stabilization are simultaneously required for the transcription of some critical antiviral genes, such as MxA, IFIT1 and IFITM3.39 It has been revealed that pathogenic influenza A virus (IAV) can exploit cellular machinery to control the transcription of a subset of ISGs by altering their histone modifications.40 Viral infection and replication are strongly blocked directly by some critical ISGs, such as MxA, IFITM3, and IFIT3 through various mechanisms.37, 41 However, many cellular proteins are responsible for the negative regulation of IFN production and signaling, such as SOCS1, PIAS, and IFI35, which not only repress the JAK\u2010STAT pathway but also inhibit PRR.42, 43, 44 Type I IFNs signaling also mediates the development or activation of innate immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs), NK cells, and T cells, which eliminates the virus\u2010infected cells directly or indirectly.45 While the critical antiviral roles of proteins have been well\u2010characterized, little is known about lncRNAs, until recently when increasing evidences have presented and demonstrated that lncRNAs are important players in the battle between virus and host.\n",

Solid evidences from IAV and SARS\u2010CoV infected eight collaborative cross mouse founder strains further confirm that 5329 lncRNAs are differentially expressed and strongly correlated with viral replication and morbidity.48 The module\u2010based annotation reveals that most lncRNAs are co\u2010expressed with coding genes associated with lung homeostasis or immune response. The database MONOCLdb (http://www.monocldb.org) provides 5295 mouse lncRNAs and their functional annotations.

When T cells are activated, dephosphorylated NFAT is released from the complex and enters the nucleus. A recent study suggests that downregulation of NRON by HIV infection enhances NFAT nuclear translocation and activity.51 Consequently, NFAT is hijacked by HIV to bind with the LTR of viral genome and facilitate viral protein synthesis and replication. Strikingly, HIV even utilizes NRON to control the balance between viral reproduction and cell death through HIV early expressed protein Neg and the late expressed protein Vpr to respectively decrease and increase NRON at different infection stage.51 The HIV\u2010induced upregulation of NFAT is simultaneously utilized by host as well to increase the adaptive immune response to HIV by activation of T cells.\n",

The knockdown and overexpression analysis reveals that NKILA, similar to Lethe, is a negative regulator of the transcription of NF\u2010\u03baB target genes. NKILA interacts with other molecules to form a cytoplasmic complex comprising NKILA, NF\u2010\u03baB, and inhibitor of NF\u2010\u03baB (I\u03baB). In the complex, NKILA blocks the phosphorylation sites of I\u03baB from I\u03baB kinase (IKK) and protects I\u03baB from subsequent degradation. Therefore, NF\u2010\u03baB is sequestered in the cytoplasm and thereby NF\u2010\u03baB driven transcription is inhibited. This mechanism underlying NKILA function is similar with that of cytoplasmic lnc\u2010DC (discussed below).

The altered expression or activity of these pivotal innate immune molecules significantly influences the host antiviral response and thereby affects the viral infection and replication.

These findings provide strong evidences supporting the key role played by the ubiquitous and versatile lncRNAs in antiviral innate immunity.
