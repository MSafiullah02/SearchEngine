Notably, in zones 1, 2, and X, the ICD-9 diagnosis code category matching \u201cother facility unavailable\u201d also achieved statistical significance as a secondary diagnosis.",

In addition, we used municipal administrative evacuation zones developed post hoc based on the damage incurred by Hurricane Sandy. These areas may not precisely match the true underlying geographic impact of Hurricane Sandy, particularly for electrical failures. Given the number of ICD-9 diagnosis code categories that we examined, we made adjustments to the level of statistical significance required to identify a category with increased ED utilization. Important categories of ED utilization may have been missed by using this stringent requirement for statistical significance. Finally, our study was limited to New York City, a unique and dense urban environment, and to Hurricane Sandy. The findings of our study may not be generalizable to other regions of the country or to other types of disasters in which different changes in ED utilization may occur.",

First, overall ED utilization generally decreased in the early days after Hurricane Sandy, consistent with prior studies of disasters. However, we found that the most disaster-prone regions actually demonstrated increases in ED utilization. Early ED utilization may predict those areas most significantly affected by a disaster. Similar to early warning systems, an uptick in ED utilization in a given geographic area may be an initial indication of those areas most severely affected by a given disaster. Close monitoring of the geographic distribution of ED utilization may provide those involved in disaster management with a means of making early decisions on resource deployment based on concrete data.",

These included chronic diseases (eg, diabetes, cardiac comorbidities), complex medical needs (eg, ostomy, amputation), other contributors to vulnerability (eg, advanced age, dementia), and social determinants of health (eg, homelessness). We also noted an increased frequency of ED visits for disaster-related conditions (eg, hypothermia, environmental exposures), advanced medical needs (eg, drug-resistant infections, isolation requirement), and disruption of the availability of other health care facilities. Hospitals should be prepared to handle each of these critical issues in the event of a disaster. We also found a high number of administrative encounters for prescription refills, which may be amenable to mobile or temporary pharmacy solutions.",

We confirmed that dialysis-dependent and ventilator-dependent patients present early, as previously described. In addition, patients with hypothermia and environmental exposures may present in the early periods after a disaster. First responders must be prepared for medically vulnerable populations with complex medical needs and special cases and conditions, especially given that response may be hampered by the severity of the disaster or electrical outages. In addition, we found a somewhat delayed increase in ED use among patients with diabetes. Delivery of diabetes medications to disaster-prone areas may reduce the need for ED utilization and improve management of these important chronic conditions. Patients with certain types of chronic disease may be able to manage in the first few days after a disaster but eventually develop the acute need to access medical care.",
