This practice is convenient for faculty and residents, who may be dispersed in satellite clinics or segregated teams, allowing lectures to start at more convenient times (e.g., 7:00 am rather than 6:30 am because travel is eliminated). The long-term impact is that online video lectures are likely to continue after the pandemic.",

This approach also is easily adopted and increases the availability of invited national or international speakers (no need for travel), with reduced costs. A disadvantage is that online grand rounds reduce the opportunity for residents to network with senior ophthalmologists, some of whom may become fellowship preceptors. The long-term impact is that online grand rounds are likely to continue, but only as a component of the curriculum, because physical interaction and networking remain important.",

Personal protective equipment is required in clinics to prevent possible infection of patients and staff. A consequence of the decreased volume is that many patients are losing sight irreversibly. Before COVID-19, many AMCs previously had developed virtual clinics and telemedicine programs.2\n,\n3 Now patient acceptance has increased, including coding and billing for telemedicine services by insurers, which may hasten the adoption of such telemedicine programs.4 For patients with mobile phones or computers, some AMCs can conduct face-to-face interviews. Others have adopted new technologies for visual acuity and visual field tests via telemedicine. Home monitoring equipment such as OCT may be possible for patients who can afford it.5 To reassure patients who fear contagion at the AMC and to re-establish follow-up, some AMCs are scheduling appointments in safe environments outside the hospital. The long-term impact is that digital and telehealth initiatives are likely to be sustained, because virtual clinics and telemedicine will be established clinical practice for screening and monitoring of stable patients.6 This approach may address some important problems in patient management, such as the failure of patients to receive the degree of clinical care in practice environments (e.g., rigorous follow-up for management of age-related macular degeneration) that they are required to receive in registration clinical trials.",

However, because many AMCs are level 1 trauma units, complex cases (e.g., orbital cellulitis with abscess, intraocular foreign bodies) continue to receive surgery. In many AMCs, ambulatory surgery centers are closed, and ophthalmology cases are performed in the main operating rooms. The need for appropriate equipment for eye surgery in the main operating rooms thus has been demonstrated. Academic medical centers also have increased the rigor of protocols to ensure health and safety of operating room personnel during anesthesia induction, particularly for general anesthesia cases (with aerosol generation), before, during, and after surgery. The long-term impact is that routine elective surgeries will be increased after the pandemic. Heightened safety standards are likely to persist indefinitely.",

This will accelerate incorporation of artificial intelligence into clinical practice.7 The pandemic also has had significant impact on surgical training for residents (e.g., 4\u20136 months of reduced surgical volume). Given the travel restrictions, no alternative surgical sites exist for residents. Training may need to rely more heavily on virtual reality surgical simulators.8 During this pandemic, medical students likely will not have exposure to ophthalmology. The long-term impact on clinical standards resulting from a reduction in clinical and surgical exposure on this cohort of graduating ophthalmology trainees is unclear. A cohort of graduating general physicians will have little to no ophthalmology exposure. Academic medical centers will need to modify residency curriculum to include data science, informatics, virtual reality training, and telemedicine.",

A decrease in patient follow-up and treatment because of fear of acquiring COVID-19 in the clinic may impact clinical trial outcomes. Telemedicine has been used to contact patients, but remote diagnostics (e.g., vision, OCT), although useful for routine clinical care, may not be suitable for clinical trials. Regulatory agencies (e.g., the Food and Drug Administration) may have to accept novel data acquisition strategies. Some AMCs are establishing mobile vans for clinical trial patients for assessment and treatment. The long-term impact is that clinical research protocols likely will need to adapt to account for future pandemics, including novel data acquisition, telemedicine, online questionnaires, and remote monitoring. Regulatory agencies may modify their requirements regarding data capture.",
