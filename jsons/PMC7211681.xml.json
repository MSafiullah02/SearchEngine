            "text": "In December 2019, a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 was found to have caused an outbreak in Wuhan, China [1]. On March 13, 2020 the World Health Organization declared the SARS-Co-V-2 outbreak a pandemic. Coronavirus disease or COVID-19 as it\u2019s called can vary from mild flu like symptoms to severe ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), multiple organ system failure (MOSF) and death [2]. To date no therapeutics have been proved effective for the treatment of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 [3]. Mortality rates vary depending on the country of origin. The high mortality rates in Italy compared to other countries, for example, were explained by the fact that 23% of the Italian population were 65 years or older. In addition, compared to China, a much higher proportion of the infected population are older than 70 years old (37.6% compared to 11.9% in china)[4]. Another possible explanation of the high fatality rate in Italy is the high number of obese individuals among the elderly population [4,5]. Given the high incidence of obesity among the American population this can have devastating consequences on the case fatality rates in the United States. Recently, it was reported that mortality rates in NYC, the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, were found to be significantly higher in African Americans and Hispanics compared to other ethnic groups. The aim of this manuscript is to evaluate the mortality rates in NYC among the different ethnic groups and the different boroughs as it relates to the obesity rates to see whether this issue merits further evaluation.",

Our prior experience with the impact of obesity on outcomes of patients infected with H1N1 influenza raises major concerns and should be taking into account while dealing with COVID-19 patients suffering from obesity [7]. In this observational study we noticed that the NYC boroughs with the highest mortality rates are the ones that suffer from high incidence of obesity among its adult population and that Hispanics and African Americans who have historically higher obesity rates are also disproportionately affected by higher age adjusted mortality rates compared to the other ethnic groups. Although we cannot make any definitive conclusions based on those observations, it\u2019s prudent to say that more work needs to be done to clearly elucidate the correlation between obesity and mortality rates secondary to COVID-19.",

The effect of obesity on the high mortality rates can be explained by the presence of obesity related health conditions in individuals suffering from obesity, as mentioned previously, or by the fact that obesity was shown to be associated with poor lung function including high rates of obstructive sleep apnea, decreased expiratory reserve volume, decreased functional capacity and poor lung compliance [8]. The other explanation is possibly the increase in inflammatory cytokines in patients with obesity especially with new reports stating that cytokine storms are leading to some of the observed rapid deterioration of certain COVID 19 patients [2,9,10].",

First, the data, although very recent, is being updated by government officials on a daily basis and given the lag in reports from laboratories the mortality rate reported herein can be an underestimation or overestimation based on the COVID-19 laboratory results. Second, to date we do not have de-identified data on the BMI and race of patients who succumbed to COVID-19, with more granular data from government officials we may be able to answer the question of whether obesity is directly associated with COVID-19 related deaths. Finally, NYC officials were discouraging patients with mild to moderate symptoms from being tested (this may be subject to change over time) so the data presented in this manuscript represent mostly patients with severe illness. Lastly. The age adjusted mortality rates per ethnicity group was missing data (data was complete in only 63% of reported deaths).",
