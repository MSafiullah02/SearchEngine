For instance, theory could play a critical role in developing our understanding of how and at what cost organizations and the individuals within them have changed and adapted to COVID-19; if, and if so, how educational philosophies or ideologies have shifted; how we think about individual and collective resilience and wellness; how professional identity formation may have been reshaped during this period of disruption; and indeed, how we think about the purposes and principles of health professional education. Theory informs methods and we would look to our authors to select and/or develop methodologies and methods that allow the multitude of questions emerging from COVID-19 events to be explored carefully and compellingly.",

While there is likely to be much valuable work about the impacts of the pandemic on training, on the adaptation and adaptability of programs and participants, and the impacts and implications of those changes, there are many more areas worthy of exploration. For instance, the critical importance of public health and its use of data and modeling has been a notable aspect of our responses to COVID-19. What are the implications of this in HPE? There are many indirect issues worthy of exploration such as the likely economic pressures that a significant world economic downturn is likely to have on education, whether the emergency changes made will persist (such as a much more extensive use of online educational tools and environments), and how we might reconsider how we model and teach professionalism and ethics when many healthcare providers have lost their lives and many more are working under very difficult circumstances. Indeed, we might be well to reconsider the most fundamental issues in HPE as to how we prepare for and recognize when a learner is ready to practice.",

Authors may also explore how the different adaptions to medical education practices have impacted learners' core skills development or their professional identity formation. At a wider systems level, authors might explore how curriculum leaders decided which educational activities were to be added, dropped or changed and the drivers, costs, and impacts of those decisions. It may be that some will present findings that show that HPE was found wanting and needs to undergo fundamental change, while others may argue that HPE was well prepared, and may even have been strengthened by the current crisis. Finally, we would be interested in studies exploring how the pandemic has affected HPE research, its activities, funding opportunities, and its place in HPE as a whole.",

And yet, as Churchill once said, \"never let a good crisis go to waste\". There is a window of opportunity afforded by the pandemic and our responses to it to examine much of what we do in HPE in a new light and from perspectives that have not previously been available to us. COVID-19 may provide an opportunity for HPE to demonstrate its worth to society more than ever. However, COVID-19 is not all the world, our many other problems and challenges persist, and they need robust scholarly responses too. Now, as much as we are tired and afraid as individuals and as a species, we need to respond with all the power and insight our sciences can bring to bear. Let that be our challenge to the community; to honour the suffering but at the same time advance our thinking and practice as best we can. Only by doing so will the current situation and its ramifications help us rethink how we educate, and question what it is we need to teach, and what it is we are preparing our learners for. The full quote from Camus is: \"To state quite simply what we learn in time of pestilence: that there are more things to admire in men than to despise.\"",

We invite submissions that speak to the role of disciplinary and interdisciplinary perspectives in the study of health professions education, in particular those that reflect our focus on theory and method from diverse social and behavioural science disciplines. Papers could take a variety of formats: a review of the history of contributions from disciplines such as psychology and sociology, introduction of new disciplinary/or interdisciplinary thinking, or original studies exemplifying the use of theory and/or methods from a discipline. We would also be interested in contributions to HPE from fields such as economics, business, engineering, big data, and artificial intelligence among others. Further details on the Journal website.",
