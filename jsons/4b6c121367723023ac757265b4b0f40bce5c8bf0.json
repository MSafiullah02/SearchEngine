Response efficacy assesses the belief 309 that the recommended coping response might be effective in reducing their threat and self-310 efficacy assesses the perceived ability to perform the recommended coping response. 8 Both 311 constructs influence the nurses' motivation to conduct the recommended coping response. The 312 regression coefficients from these two constructs indicate that higher self-efficacy and/or higher 313 response efficacy can lead to an increase in the nurses' proactive protection motivation. These 314 findings are consistent with previous studies that used PMT as their theoretical framework. 315",

In addition, construct 189 validity was examined through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using the same study 190 sample population. PCA yielded two components in protection motivation: proactive protection 191 motivation and passive protection motivation (unpublished data). Four items loaded as proactive 192 protection motivation, which examined the emergency room nurse's motivation to actively 193 identify and seek resources or prevent the spread of the Ebola virus by adhering to the rules and 194 regulations set by their place of employment. One item loaded as passive protection motivation, 195 which examined the emergency nurse's motivation to stay inactive by being hands-off (such as 196 avoid going to work) when confronted with a situation where a patient might have the Ebola 197 infection. Each of the remaining survey constructs, i.e. self-efficacy, response efficacy, response 198 cost, knowledge, outcome expectations, perceived vulnerability, perceived severity and fear 199 yielded only one component with PCA. To test the reliability of the instrument, internal 200 consistency and stability were evaluated using a convenience sample of emergency nurses 201 (n=23) to conduct Cronbach's alpha and Spearman Rho Correlation respectively. Cronbach's 202 alpha ranged between .46 and .97, with six of the eight survey constructs having an alpha of .80 203 or greater, which were within the recommended range. 24 Spearman Rho Correlation was 204 conducted to assess the stability of responses in each construct at two different points in time by 205 examining the statistical significance of the coefficient. Items that had a p-value less than or 206 equal to .05 were removed or modified. The survey had ten sections comprised of items for each 207 construct and demographic questions. The instrument included six items on perceived 208 vulnerability, seven items on perceived severity, four items on response efficacy, five items on 209 self-efficacy, seven items on fear, five items on response cost, five items on protection 210 motivation and six items on outcome expectation, with each item having five-point one 211 directional response options.

The 415 lessons learned from this study, though about the Ebola virus infection, can be applied to the 416 COVID-19 pandemic, since their transmission routes are similar, therefore nurses' protection 417 motivation can be reasonably projected. 418 Future research should focus on conducting a longitudinal study that examines how 419 knowledge affects nurses' motivation to protect themselves from the Ebola virus or other 420 infectious diseases. Transmission routes and ease of transmission, as well as the morbidity and 421 mortality of the disease should be examined to explore if there is a relationship between these 422 factors and nurses' motivation to protect themselves from infectious diseases and if their 423 protection motivation varies across diseases. Low variance found in the analysis did not indicate 424 very strong predictors for protection motivation within the modified PMT model. However, PMT 425 has been used by previous researchers to examine the prevention of HIV and nurses' motivation 426 to care for HIV patients. 8,10 Similar infectious diseases have used PMT to explore nurses' 427 motivation to care, this suggests that the theory is appropriate for this study. The addition of 428 other constructs to the original PMT model or modifying the survey items might be another 429 suggestion that could indicate stronger predictors for protection motivation. 430 This research did not measure the actual behavior of nurses but focused on their intended 431 behavior. It is suggested that future research should examine the nurses' actual behavior and the 432 use of preventive recommendations and non-pharmacological interventions when providing care 433 to infected patients compared to the nurse's intended behavior. Legitimate reasons such as fear 434 and limited knowledge affect whether nurses conduct proactive protection motivation behavior 435 or passive protection motivation behavior. Fear, possible response cost and limited knowledge 436 hinders and possibly influence nurses when providing care to potential patients infected with 437",

Post hoc Dunn-Bonferroni tests indicated that male respondents had 247 significantly higher self-efficacy (t=2.85, p<.005) while females had significantly higher 248 response cost (t=2.81, p=.005). Among the age groups, there was a statistically significant 249 difference with regards to the emergency nurses' passive protection motivation (Post hoc Dunn-Bonferroni tests indicated that participants aged 50-65, when compared with 252 those who aged 21-35 and 36-49, had significantly lower passive protection motivation (t=4.89 253 and 4.26 respectively, both p<.0001). Furthermore, participants aged 50-65 perceived themselves 254 less vulnerable to the infection than those aged 21-35 (t=3.76, p<.001). Also, compared to those 255 aged 36-49 (t=3.88, p<.001) and 21-35 (t=2.41, p<.05), participants aged 50-65 believe the 256 response cost associated with protecting themselves from the infection is relatively lower. 257 The total training hours on controlling an Ebola infection and the hours received from 258 their place of employment illustrated statistically significant differences in the participants' self-259 efficacy (\u03c7 2 (1) =29.17, 23.25, p<.0001), fear (\u03c7 2 (1) =18.48, p<.0001; 14.17, p<.001, respectively), 260 hours of training on controlling an Ebola infection either from their place of employment or 262 elsewhere had significantly higher self-efficacy, less fear, and lower response cost in managing 263an Ebola infection than those who had less than 10 hours of training. These results demonstrate 264 to health care administrators that providing more than 10 hours of training in infection control 265 for emergency room nurses will make them better prepared and confident. 266Emergency nurses who felt prepared (versus those who felt unprepared) to provide care 267 to potential patients with an Ebola infection had statistically significantly lower passive 268 protection motivation (t=-3.33, p<.001), lower perceived vulnerability (t=-6.30, p<.0001), higher 269 response efficacy (t=3.01, p<001), higher self-efficacy (t=8.67, p<.0001), less fear (t=-6.30, 270 p<.0001), lower response cost (t=-3.80, p<.001), lower outcome expectation (t=-3.65, p<.001), 271 and lower perceived severity (t=-2.90, p<.005).Furthermore, the results showed that the level of licensure is associated with the 273 licensure found that, when compared with RN and clinical nurse specialist, LPN/LVN had 276Spearman Rho Correlation matrix inTable 2 [insert Table 2] displayed the computed 279 coefficients for each psychological variable when associated with the outcome variables. 280 Proactive protection motivation was highly and positively correlated with response efficacy 281 (\u03c1=.26, p<.0001), self-efficacy (\u03c1=.18, p<.0001), outcome expectations (\u03c1=.16, p<.005) and 282 perceived severity (\u03c1=.17, p<.001).
