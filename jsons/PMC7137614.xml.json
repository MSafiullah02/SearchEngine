Severe maternal respiratory failure and hypoxemia may disrupt uterine placental flow and cause miscarriage. Ribavirin is a commonly used first-line medication for the management of SARS in Hong Kong. Six patients had ribavirin, and a significant embryocidal effect has been observed in rabbits and mice, it may be possible that during this anembryonic stage ribavarin was the cause of spontaneous miscarriage.14., 15. There are no human data for early pregnancy use and such postulation needs further confirmation. Ribavirin was also associated with significant teratogenic effects in animal studies.14., 16. Patients who decide to use ribavirin in early pregnancy should be given the option for termination of pregnancy.",

            "text": "In maternal pneumonia, neonatal morbidity frequently arises as a result of preterm labor (15%-44%).17., 18. Eighty percent of our cohort who presented after 24 weeks were delivered preterm and therefore were associated with higher neonatal morbidity. Other fetal/neonatal complications include IUGR, intrauterine demise, and neonatal death.17., 18. IUGR appears to be a common sequel among our patients who carried on with their pregnancies. This might be due to the severe maternal respiratory illness affecting the oxygen supply to the fetuses. These patients had frequent episodes of oxygen desaturation, often falling below 90%. The situation resembles that of those living at high altitudes, causing a low arterial partial pressure of oxygen19., 20. and consequent IUGR. The general impact of a severe maternal debilitating illness on fetal growth also needs to be considered. The placental findings of placental infarction (patient 9) indicate maternal thrombosis, and the avascular villi (patients 8 and 9) suggest fetal thrombosis. There was also significant placental weight reduction relating to the duration of SARS before delivery (Table III). Again, these changes were likely to represent complications of the hypoxemia and circulatory insufficiency in both the mother and fetus as a result of SARS. The observed fetal growth restriction is unlikely to be due to hydrocortisone or methyl-prednisolone, as neither steroid crosses the placenta readily.",

Direct contact with maternal body fluid that contained SARS-CoV put the infants at high risk of perinatal infection. Preventive measures at delivery, such as performing nasopharyngeal suction before first breath and cleansing the infant soon after birth, might help to reduce the viral load. It was a fortunate finding from our cohort that there was no evidence of vertical transmission, despite close contact with SARS virus. Indeed, there should be a theoretical advantage of delaying delivery in these patients to avoid the exposure of these infants to the virus at birth. The passage of maternal SARS-CoV antibodies across the placenta to the fetal circulation should have additional protective effect on the fetus/neonate. Nevertheless, it was our experience that the timing of delivery was frequently dictated by the deteriorating maternal condition.",
