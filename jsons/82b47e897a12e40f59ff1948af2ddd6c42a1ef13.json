This chapter reviewed in-vehicle air quality and passenger exposures for roadway commuters, commercial airplanes, and marine transportation. The sources of pollutants in-vehicle can be categorized as the same as other indoor environments, including outdoor air, human activity, emission from building material and interior furnisher, and biological metabolic process from animals and microbes. However, the exposure in vehicles varies from now and then, influenced by window open/closed, speed, air flow, ventilation on/off, air conditioner on/off, pollutants from ambient outdoor air, interior material, and number of passengers. There are few studies on health condition of passengers, except infectious disease during airway transportation. Some health studies of related occupations are reviewed.",

Literatures have reported an air exchange rate of 120/h and an equilibrated exposure level to outdoor air at open window condition [6, 7] . At window closed condition, in-vehicles exposure level varies upon fan on/off and air recirculation on/off [8] . Particulate matters, black carbon, NO2 are common pollutants related to outdoor air and traffic, and the level of PM2.5, black carbon, and NO 2 have been reported higher in vehicles compare to ambient outdoor air [9] [10] [11] . The in-vehicle level of ultrafine particulates can be reduced by high air recirculation rate with a high efficiency air particulate filter [12] . Most of the studies on in-vehicle exposures did not include subways, and the studies on subway cabin exposure mainly focused on microbial contaminations. Roadway commuting in vehicles has been reported associated with elevated level of exhaled nitric oxide, C-reactive-protein, and exhaled malondialdehyde, which indicated inflammation in respiratory tract and increased oxidative stress [13] (Fig. 6.1 ).",

The level of aromatic hydrocarbon pollutant increases when cabin temperature goes up, fan turned off, or air recirculation turned on [18] . Moreover, the level of benzene is one tenth higher in new vehicles compared to old ones, while the concentration of toluene, xylenes, and ethylbenzene is doubled in new vehicles compared to old ones [19] . The emission of formaldehyde and carbonyl compounds is mainly from interior material in vehicle cabin, and the exposure level increases when the temperature is high.

This system supplies compressed air continuously to the cockpit and cabin. The outdoor air passes the engine to get heated to 400 \u00b0C and sterile, then the air enters the compressor to get cooled and packed. The packed fresh air enters the cockpit directly, while it is mixed with 50% recirculated air before entering the cabin. The air recirculation system for the cabin contains filters for particles, including pre-filters for large particles and high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters. HEPA filters can remove particles with a diameter down to 0.3 \u03bcm with 99.99% efficiency [31, 32] . Many, but not all aircraft have HEPA filters. In most airplanes, there is an ozone converter before the air entering cockpit and cabin. There could be moisture condensation in the airplane, which goes into the wall construction. The wall is constructed with mineral insulation, but there is no dampness barrier in the wall.",

The relative air humidity is usually below 10% during cruise [33] , and the temperature is in the range 22-26 \u00b0C [33, 34] . The concentration of CO2 is between 500-1000 ppm during cruise [33] , which is under the recommended limit of 1000 ppm [35] . However, during the taxi, take off, and landing phases, the level of CO2 could reach a higher range up to 2500 ppm. The mean NO2 level has been reported at 7 \u03bcg/m 3 [33] . Nowadays, in most of the airliners there is an ozone converter, which catalyze ozone into oxygen. However, it is optional on some type of airplanes. The old converters should be replaced with new ones after a certain period, otherwise the ozone level would be elevated [36] . The mean concentration of ozone in the cockpit has been reported at 26.3 \u03bcg/m 3 , but the highest level tested is 76.1 \u03bcg/m 3 [33] . The ventilation air flow in the cockpit environment is 60-80 L/s per person [37, 38] . There is no dampness barrier in the airplane wall, and moisture in the cabin air may enter the double-layer wall and condense, where there is a potential for bacteria and fungi growth. Radiation exposure has been evaluated among Germen aircrews, and the annual accumulative dose was reported higher in elder pilots and younger cabin crews than in their counterparts, which is associated with high frequency of long-haul intercontinental routes, mostly to the north [39] (Fig. 6. 2).",

The concentration of viable bacteria increases during cruise, possibly due to more frequent passenger and cabin crew activity [47] . A study using cultivating method reports that bacteria measured in the cabin environment include bacteria common on human skin surface or in dust and outdoor air [48] . Fungi levels are low, and the predominating genera include Cladosporium, Aspergillus, and Penicillium [49] . The cultivating method is very practical, but it may lose majority of the species [47] . In recent years, sequencing of 16S rRNA gene is used to identify microbial community in a certain environment. A recent study analyzed bacterial communities in HEPA filters from commercial aircraft cabin, by microarray sequencing of 16S rRNA gene and bio-informatics analysis [50] . The subfamilies detected in airplane cabin include bacteria from human skin, gastrointestinal tracts, respiratory tracts, and bacteria from water and soil. The bacterial composition in aircraft cabin differs from urban outdoor air [50] . Pathogens as well as nonpathogens were detected [50] . A quite recent study on airplane cabin microbial community has reported that microbial diversity varies between flights; airborne microbial communities differ from those on the touch surfaces. And no patterns have been determined for the changes of microbiome community from pre-and post-flight [51] . There are few studies done on fungi levels in aircraft measured by molecular methods. Fu et al. have investigated the level of fungal DNA in the airplane environment, and have reported that the level of fungal DNA in airplanes is as low as 20% of the average level in European classrooms [52] . Microbial volatile organic compounds (MVOCs) have been detected in the airplane cabin in the same study, and the total MVOCs level has been 3.7 times of the average level in Nordic homes. Moreover, two pentanols, 2-methyl-1-butanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol, had a concentration at 15 and 17 times of the Nordic home level, respectively [52] . Endotoxin has been detected both in air and dust in the airplane cabin, and the mean endotoxin levels in air and settled dust are both higher than the mean levels reported in homes and office buildings [53] . Moreover, 3-hydroxy fatty acids, a marker of endotoxin, can be detected in settled seat dust and carpet dust [53] .",

Fragment of bacteria and fungi (0.1-1.0 \u03bcm), and viruses (0.01-0.02 \u03bcm) may not be removed by the HEPA filter. The aircraft cabin is a crowded indoor environment and there has been concern about the spread of airway infections in aircraft. Nowadays pilots spend all time in the cockpit which has a separate ventilation system. However, before the 11th September terrorist attack in 2001, pilots could spend short periods in the forward part of the cabin during cruise, socializing with the cabin attendants. Existing studies on spread of infections in aircraft have mainly focused on transmission among passengers and airline crews. Airborne pathogen transmission was reported to be associated with sitting within two rows of the index person on board during more than 8 h [55] . The transmission is believed to be by large droplets, and increased ventilation rate can decrease the infection risk [55] . Spread of influenza follows previously observed transmission model, but passengers sitting further away than two rows can be infected [55] . Transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) can occur on board faster and at wider areas than the typical transmission model [56] . One tracing contact study of SARS among 1766 passengers found no spread of SARS [57] . Another study of SARS infection traced 304 passengers and crew with one or two index person on board, and reported 23 infections [56] . The relative risk of passengers sitting within three rows in front of the index person was 3.1 (95% CI: 1.4-6.9), compared to passengers seated elsewhere in the cabin [56] . Two tracing contact studies of the swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 from UK and USA have reported an attack rate of 4.3% (95% CI: 1.7-6.9%) [58] and 5.2% [59] , respectively, among passengers from flights carrying one index passenger, but no crew got infected [59] . The transmission during air travel is a common concern, since it contributes to intercontinental spread of pathogens.",

In some airlines, passengers are allowed to bring small furry pets with them, which increases the risk of allergen contamination on board. Fu et al. have reported that textile material used in cabin seats is associated with higher dust amount and higher allergen levels in the cabin when compared with leather seats. The levels of cat (Fel d1), dog (Can f1), and horse (Equ cx) allergens in the cabins with textile seats are 50, 27, and 75 times of those levels in cabins with leather seats, respectively [52] .",

Some studies reported emissions from ferry or ship engine exhaust, which elevated the level of CO 2 and NO x by threefold on average, and the levels of VOCs vary a lot when different kinds of fuel and fuel load were used [63] . Webster and Reynolds reviewed studies on indoor air quality on passenger ships, including effective factors, sources of pollutants, levels of pollutants, and health concerns [64] . The main pollutants from traffic pollution, like NOx, CO, and VOCs have been reported at low level in indoor environment on these ships/ferries, and the indoor air quality is affected by heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. According to reported data, the indoor air quality of cabin rooms is relatively stable, while the indoor air condition varies time by time in bars and restaurants, depending on the number of customers. The average temperature and relative air humidity in cabin rooms are 22 \u00b0C and 30%, respectively, and the concentration of CO 2 is in the range 600-800 ppm when there is human activity. Moreover, the average temperature and relative air humidity in bars and restaurants are 20 \u00b0C and 40%, respectively, and the concentration of CO 2 is in the range 600-1500 ppm when there is human activity [65] (Fig. 6.4) . Microbes (biological contaminants) have been reported to be the main contaminants in indoor environment on passenger ships. There are usually filters in ventilation system to block particles and microbes, from entering the indoor air on board. However, dirty, old, or damaged filters very often allowed spores of mould passing through and entering the indoor air [65] . Cladosporium, Penicillium, and Aspergillus have been detected on board passenger ships, which are commonly detected in indoor or outdoor moulds [65] . Aspergillus may cause health problems among people with a weak immune system or lung disease, or in combination with other bacteria or fungi [66] . No quantified levels of microbial contamination have been reported (Fig. 6.5 ). ",
