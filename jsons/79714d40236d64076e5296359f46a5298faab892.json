Therefore, in general, they have relatively low animal toxicity. There are hundreds of herbicides and herbicide mixtures on the market in the United States and throughout the world. Seven of the top 10 pesticide active ingredients (by amount used) are herbicides. Chlorophenoxy herbicides are plant growth regulators. They are commonly used for broadleaf weed control on cereal crops and pastures. Common chlorophenoxy herbicides include 2,4-D; Dicamba; and Silvex. Many products available to consumers include a mixture of salts in a petroleum base. Most toxicity from contact with skin or eyes or ingestion involves mucous membrane irritation. Very high dose exposure may result in neurological symptoms including muscle twitching, seizures, and coma. Renal and hepatic dysfunction may occur with large ingestions. Long-term health effects of low to moderate exposure include alleged, but not confirmed, carcinogenicity, teratogenicity, and reproductive abnormalities. Although no specific antidote is known, alkaline diuresis has been reported to be of value in severe overdose. Otherwise, aggressive supportive care including protection of the airway, correction of hypotension, and treatment of arrhythmias, hyperthermia, and seizures may be required (3) .",

Bypyridyls exert their herbicidal activity by interfering with reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) to reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) during photosynthesis, producing superoxide, singlet oxygen, and hydroxyl and peroxide radicals. This eventually destroys lipid cell membranes, including those in the lungs, leading to late and irreversible pulmonary fibrosis. Major local effects of paraquat are due to its caustic properties. Corneal ulceration has been reported after paraquat concentrate was splashed in the eyes. Gastrointestinal tract ulceration including esophageal ulceration with perforation has occurred. After ingestion of >30 mg/kg of paraquat concentrate, pulmonary, cardiac, renal, and hepatic failure can occur within hours. Ingestion of 4 mL/kg or more may cause renal failure, resulting in impaired paraquat excretion and higher serum concentrations. Pulmonary involvement is the major target of ingested paraquat with an adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like syndrome developing 1 to 2 days after ingestion, progressing to pulmonary fibrosis in a few days.",

Cautious aspiration with a nasogastric tube is appropriate if the patient presents within the first hour after ingestion. Because of the possibility of severe toxicity, some authorities still recommend activated charcoal (1 to 2 g/kg) if the patient is seen within 1 to 2 hours, repeated 4 hours later. Hemodialysis is effective for removing paraquat from the blood. Pulmonary damage is increased by oxygen supplementation, so low-oxygen breathing mixtures are recommended. Immunosuppression has been attempted with corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide or other similar agents, with limited success. Deferoxamine and N-acetylcysteine have been used as antioxidants. Prospective studies supporting immunosuppressive and antioxidant therapies are lacking. Diquat is felt to have much less pulmonary toxicity, but pulmonary fibrosis may also occur, especially if oxygen supplementation is used. Chlormequat toxicity resembles organophosphate toxicity but should not be treated as such (see the discussion of organophosphate pesticides in the next section). Treatment is by GI decontamination and supportive care. Morfamquat is rarely used. No human or animal toxicity has been reported with morfamquat, but poisoning with the chemical should probably be treated initially as a paraquat poisoning (6).",

A wide variety of organic and inorganic chemicals have been used to control rodents. Plant-derived materials such as strychnine and red squill or inorganic compounds such as thallium or arsenic trioxide were among chemicals used early for rodent control. Newer agents tend to be synthetic organic compounds. All pose particular risks for accidental poisonings. Since these agents are designed to kill mammals, their toxicity is often similar for the target rodents and for humans. Also, since rodents often share environments with humans and other mammals, the risk of accidental exposure to the rodenticide is high because of their placement in those environments. As rodents have become resistant to some chemicals, more toxic chemicals have been developed, exposing those applying them and those living in areas where they are used to increased risk of toxicity.

The initial dose is 1 to 2 mg for adults and 25 to 50 mg/kg for children given intravenously over 15 to 30 minutes. A continuous infusion of 10 to 20 mg/kg, up to 500 mg/h, is then used in severe OP poisoning. More detailed information on OP poisoning management is found in standard texts on poisoning and drug overdose. Severe OP poisoning has been associated with chronic neurological sequelae including cognitive impairment, depression, and peripheral neuropathies. An intermediate syndrome, termed organophosphate-induced delayed-onset neuropathy (OPDIN) associates hyperreflexia and hypertonicity with long-term, lowdose exposure to OPs. Both syndromes are rarely recognized",
