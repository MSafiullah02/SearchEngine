            "text": "Community participation is essential in the collective response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), from compliance with lockdown, to the steps that need to be taken as countries ease restrictions, to community support through volunteering. Communities clearly want to help: in the UK, about 1 million people volunteered to help the pandemic response 1 and highly localised mutual aid groups have sprung up all over the world with citizens helping one another with simple tasks such as checking on wellbeing during lockdowns. 2 Global health guidelines already emphasise the importance of community participation. 3, 4 Incorporating insights and ideas from diverse communities is central for the coproduction of health, whereby health professionals work together with communities to plan, research, deliver, and evaluate the best possible health promotion and health-care services. 5 Pandemic responses, by contrast, have largely involved governments telling communities what to do, seemingly with minimal community input. Yet communities, including vulnerable and marginalised groups, can identify solutions: they know what knowledge and rumours are circulating; they can provide insight into stigma and structural barriers; and they are well placed to work with others from their communities to devise collective responses. Such community participation matters because unpopular measures risk low compliance. With communities on side, we are far more likely-together-to come up with innovative, tailored solutions that meet the full range of needs of our diverse populations.",

First, governments should immediately set up and fund specific community engagement taskforces to ensure that community voice is incorporated into the pandemic response. This requires dedicated staff who can help governments engage in dialogue with citizens, work to integrate the response across health and social care, and coordinate links with other sectors such as policing and education. This engagement will require additional resources to complement existing health services and public health policy. Dedicated virtual and physical spaces must be established to co-create the COVID-19 response, with different spaces tailored to the needs of different participants-eg, different formats for discussion, timings, locations, and levels of formality.",

How can we ensure front-line providers have a chance to feed into service improvements when they are already working long hours with little respite?",

Showing how policy responses or local actions address specific concerns will help communities believe that their wellbeing is valued and their needs addressed, which in turn will help increase compliance with restrictions and encourage sharing of creative solutions. Examples of responses to citizens' concerns have included introducing income guarantees for the self-employed; 15 implementing road closures and widening to allow safer cycling and walking; 16 and policy changes on home use of abortion medication to reduce risk of infection from attending clinics. 17 Institutional cultures that support coproduction must be created in political and health systems. 18 We would argue that mechanisms to ensure citizen participation are essential for high-quality, inclusive disaster response and preparedness, and these can be called upon again in future emergencies. All societies have community groups that can co-create better pandemic response and health services and politicians must be supported to incorporate these voices. Such public participation will reveal policy gaps and the potential negative consequences of any response-and identify ways to address these together. Community participation holds the promise of reducing immediate damage from the COVID-19 pandemic and, crucially, of building future resilience.",
