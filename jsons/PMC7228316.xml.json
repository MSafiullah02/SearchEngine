However, epidemiological investigation shows that the new infectors had a history of close contact with confirmed SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 patients.\n5\n The laboratory examinations (including blood routine examination, C\u2010reactive protein [CRP], lymphocyte subpopulations, and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA), as well as the chest computed tomography (CT) examination, play an important role in diagnosis, treatment, and assessment.\n6\n Although several approved antiviral drugs including lopinavir and ritonavir, interferon, arbidol, ribavirin, and chloroquine phosphate are used for empirical antiviral therapy, the use of combination therapy of traditional Chinese and western medicine is also recommended.\n7\n Currently, information regarding the clinical diagnosis and treatment of COVID\u201019 caused by SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is scarce.\n8\n In this study, the epidemiologic history, clinical diagnosis, and treatment, as well as the changes of clinical characteristics before, during and after treatment of nine cases of COVID\u201019 are reported.",

One case (9#) stated a history of direct contact with a fellow villager from a key epidemic\u2010hit Wuhan. There are two cases (6# and 7#) of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection with the familial aggregation. However, it is unknown how the two cases (1# and 2#) without the above\u2010mentioned epidemiologic history were infected.

The absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) was low, as well as the obviously decreased percentage of lymphocyte subpopulations (including CD3+ cells, CD3+CD4+ cells, and CD3+CD8+ cells) were observed in case 1# before treatment. The absolute number and the proportion of these cells gradually returned to normal levels during and after treatment. Notably, the ALC was obviously decreased during treatment but back to normal level after treatment compared with those before treatment in cases 3# and 9#. It was observed that CRP was obviously increased in cases 1#, 3#, and 9# before treatment, which gradually recovered to normal level during and after treatment. However, procalcitonin (PCT) had no clinically significant changes in all cases. Both of the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) and oxygen (pO2) in cases 1# and 9# were obviously decreased before treatment according to the existing records. With the exception of the significantly elevated lactic dehydrogenase in cases 1#, 8#, and 9# before treatment, the others were normal. Before treatment, slight rises of fibrinogen and D\u2010dimer (D\u2010D) in some patients. It was observed that the feces occult blood test was weakly positive only in case 1# with bad diarrhea before treatment.

Based on the persistent negative results of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, the lung lesions partially or completely resolved, as well as the gradually improved clinical symptoms, nine patients were discharged.

Patients of COVID\u201019 with respiratory symptoms including fever, cough, chest tightness, and shortness of breath are viewed as the primary presenting manifestation. A small number of patients have digestive symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting. In our nine patients, only two cases (1# with weak positive fecal occult blood and 2#) with diarrhea were treated with montmorillonite powder (3 g, three times a day) or trigeminy viable organism powder (1 g, three times a day) to arrest diarrhea or regulate intestinal flora. According to the Guideline for Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus\u2010infected Pneumonia (Trial version 6), patients were clinically classified into four categories including slight, moderate, severe, and imminent types.\n7\n In our study, there were four severely ill patients and five moderate patients. Notably, the average age of the former (52 years old, range from 47 to 56 years old) was much higher compared with that of the latter (34.2 years old, range from 14 to 53 years old). During and after treatment, although partial clinical data are not available, the improved lung lesions have a good consistency with the recovery of the laboratory characteristics including CRP, pCO2, and pO2. However, PCT as an indicator of severe bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections did not change significantly.\n11\n In some cases, the decreased ALC and the percentage of CD3+, CD3+CD4+, and CD3+CD8+ cells have been detected before treatment. However, these cells gradually returned to normal levels after viral clearance. Chest CT examination and the detection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA also play a vital role.\n10\n, \n12\n, \n13\n The former is helpful for rapid clinical assessment and taking effective segregating actions, while the latter has contributed to clinical diagnosis and specific drug therapy. Two male patients (cases 1# and 2#) have been observed with severe symptoms having had a history of smoking for more than 20 years.\n14\n In addition, there were no deaths in nine patients during treatment, which was associated with the effective combination therapy of traditional Chinese and western medicine. After discharge, the patient should remain in contact isolation, and pay attention to rest more, nutrition, body temperature and the prevention of infection. The regular follow\u2010up of blood routine examination, chest CT examination and the detection of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is necessary.\n15\n\n",
