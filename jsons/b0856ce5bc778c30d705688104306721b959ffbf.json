Traditional drug development involves time consuming pipelines that conflict with the urgence of identifying effective therapies during a health and economic emergency. Drug repositioning, that is the discovery of new clinical applications for drugs already approved for different therapeutic contexts, could provide an effective shortcut to bring COVID-19 treatments to the bedside in a timely manner. Moreover, computational approaches can help accelerate the process even further. Here we present the application of computational drug repositioning tools based on transcriptomics data to identify drugs that are potentially able to counteract SARS-CoV-2 infection, and also to provide insights on their mode of action. We believe that mucolytics and HDAC inhibitors warrant further investigation. In addition, we found that the DNA Mismatch repair pathway is strongly modulated by drugs with experimental in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both full results and methods are publicly available.",

Usually, in drug repurposing, a known and potentially therapeutic target is selected and an experimental search for existing compounds able to modulate the target activity is performed. Computational drug repurposing offers a complementary approach to prioritise compounds for experimental validation. Several different methods have been proposed in the literature [1] [2] [3] and some have already been applied to SARS-CoV-2 4 . These can be broadly classified into methods searching for small molecules able to bind an active pocket starting from three-dimensional structure of the target protein 5 and those searching for compounds able to modulate the expression of the target mRNA 6, 7 . While most of the existing drug repositioning pipelines focus on the former approach, here we used the latter to identify FDA approved drugs able to modulate the expression of genes expressed in the airway epithelium and that are known to interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Next, we attempted a completely agnostic approach to identify drugs reversing the gene expression profile induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, we investigated potential effective mechanisms of action by identifying molecular pathways that are consistently dysregulated by a set of 24 drugs recently proposed as effective to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection in treated Vero cells. By application of the proper computational tools, we were thus able to identify a set of drugs that should be further experimentally validated and that may have a potential beneficial role in COVID19 treatment, together with insights about mechanisms of action that could help to identify the most effective targets against the infection.",

We thus sought to identify drugs that could potentially reduce the expression of both genes, although the benefit of such an approach is being debated 15 . To this end, we applied a computational drug repositioning approach named Gene2Drug (http://gene2drug.tigem.it) 6 . This tool computes an Enrichment Score (ES) and the corresponding P-value for each of 1309 small molecules of the Connectivity Map dataset (Broad Institute), including FDA approved drugs, based on how much they tend to down-regulate the genes of interest (ACE2 and TMPRSS2), as well as other genes involved in the same pathways. Results from the analysis identified 10 drugs shown in Table 1 (p < 0.05). Most of these drugs are potentially relevant: carbenoxolone has shown antiviral activity against the Dengue virus 16 ; indomethacin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) inhibiting Prostaglandin E2 synthase (PTGES2) with a demonstrated efficacy against SARS-CoV 17 . Interestingly, in a recent study, SARS-CoV-2 viral NSP7 was found to interact with PTGES2 12 and thus the authors suggested indomethacin as potentially useful in treating patients. Here, however, indomethacin was selected by Gene2Drug because it appears to lower expression of genes in the ACE2 pathway, which does not include PTGES2 itself. Therefore indomethacin could be a high priority molecule to be tested as it could have a double effect. Another NSAID is present among the drugs identified in Table  1 , nimesulide which could have a similar effect as indomethacin. Gene2Drug also identified nicarpidine, an angiotensin inhibitor, an obvious candidate but found using a purely data-driven approach.",

In order to investigate cellular proteins interacting with viral proteins, we analyzed a set of 332 protein interactions between 26 SARS-CoV-2 proteins (plus 1 mutant) and human proteins obtained by performed an affinity purification-mass spectrometry analysis 12 . Since each of these interactions could be key to hijack the host during the course of infection, we sought to prioritize existing drugs potentially interfering with them. In particular, we applied once more Gene2drug 6 , this time exploiting its gene-set wise analysis capability. Specifically, for each viral protein, we generated a corresponding gene-set containing all the host protein interactors, thus obtaining 27 gene-sets. We then applied Gene2Drug to identify those compounds that are able to downregulate the expression of most of the genes across the 27 gene-sets at the same time, which appears a particularly effective strategy given the currently limited understanding of the specific infection mechanisms. The top 20 hits are reported in Table 2 . Interestingly, one of the hits is niclosamide, an antihelminthic drug, that 2/11 was found to have antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in a recent screening using VERO cells 18 . Other notable candidates found by our analysis are: fenoterol, which was also identified as potentially effective in a recent study on computational drug repositioning 19 ; alexidine, an antibiotic and a selective inhibitor of the mitochondrial phosphatase Ptpmt1, that was found to inhibit replication of the CytoMegaloVirus (CMV) infection 20 ; oxytetracycline, another antibiotic that has shown antiviral activity against Dengue virus 21 and the ability to reduce HIV-1 RNA transcripts within extracellular vescicles 22 ; clofibrate, a peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-) agonist previously used as a cholesterol-lowering agent, which was found to have antiviral activity against MDV, an alphaherpesvirus that infects chickens and causes a deadly lymphoma 23 ; flupentixol, a neuroleptic agent that was found to inhibit hepatitis C virus entry 24 and coxsackievirus replication 25 ; gossypol, a natural phenol derived from the cotton plant known to inhibit spermatogenesis, that was shown to have also antiviral activity 26 ; ms-275 and trichostatin A, two histone deacetylases inhibitors (HDACi), the latter found to inhibit expression of herpes simplex virus genes 27 ; interestingly valproic acid, another HDACi, was proposed for repositioning against SARS-CoV-2, as the viral protein NSP5 was found to interact with HDAC2 12 .",

We developed the MANTRA tool exploiting the cMap dataset (Broad Institute) to generate and explore drug networks for drug repositioning 28, 29 . In drug networks, nodes represent drug-induced transcriptional profiles, and edges represent similarities between them. We sought to use this approach to prioritize drugs reverting SARS-CoV-2 induced gene expression at the wholegenome level without assuming any prior knowledge of molecular mechanisms involved in the disease progression. Recently, gene expression profiles of primary human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been made publicly available 30 (GSE147507 from the GEO database). We obtained the corresponding raw data and computed the differential expression of 15,330 genes between infected and non infected cells. Out of these, only 37 genes were significantly differentially expressed (adjusted p < 0.1), most of which were over-expressed in infected cells and included interleukin 6 (IL6) and 8 (IL8), chemokines and interferon alpha inducible proteins. The MANTRA approach is based on Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and therefore it requires in input a list of all the measured genes ranked according to their differential expression, including both significant and non-significant genes. We thus sorted all the 15,330 genes according to their differential expression, but with genes most down-regulated following infection at the top of the list and those most up-regulated at the bottom. We then queried the MANTRA drug network with this profile and looked for drugs inducing a similar transcriptional profile, which therefore may potentially induce a profile opposite to that of the infection. We thus found 11 significant drugs (transcriptional distance < 0.8) listed in Table 3 . One of the 11 drugs is sirolimus, also known as rapamycin, an inhibitor of mechanistic Target Of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1), and used clinically as an immunosuppressive agent. This is an obvious candidate for this kind of drug repositioning, where the aim is to find a drug inducing an opposite repsonse to that of the virus, as most of the genes overexpressed during viral infection are immune-related. Of course, this does not mean that it is clinically relevant as suppressing the immune response could be detrimental to the cells. Nevertheless, Rapamycin was also suggested in the SARS-CoV-2 interactors' study based on the nuclecapsid interaction with the mTOR translational repressors LARP1 12 and on rapamycin reported in vitro activity against MERS 31 . Other interesting candidates found by MANTRA are: ambroxol (a metabolite of bromhexine), a mucolytic agent with reported antiviral activity against influenza-virus among others 32, 33 and with inhibition activity against TMPRSS2 34 ; corticosterone, a glucocorticoid; idoxuridine, a nucleoside analogue used to inhibit replication of DNA viruses; naltrexone, a mu-opiod receptor antagonist used for opioid and alcohol dependence, with reported antiinflammatory effect 35 ; nordihydroguaiaretic acid an antioxidant compound found in the creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) with reported antiviral activity against West Nile and Zika viruses 36 .",

One way of obtaining such knowledge is the analysis of existing small molecules that have been observed to elicit varying levels of therapeutic efficacy through drug screening. Although the mode of action of positive hits from large-scale drug screening can be difficult to identify, it is likely that such hidden mechanism is shared among most of the hits. In order to investigate and exploit this assumption, we previously developed the Drug Set Enrichment Analysis (DSEA 9 , http://dsea.tigem.it). DSEA is able to highlight molecular pathways that are consistently and specifically dysregulated by most drugs in a set by analyzing drug-induced expression profiles in the CMap dataset.",

Among the 50 screened drugs, 24 showed reduction of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein levels in infected VERO cells 18 . Of the 24 drugs, 10 were present in the cMap dataset used by DSEA (amodiaquine, ciclosporin, desoxycortone, digoxin, loperamide, mefloquine, niclosamide, ouabain, proscillaridin, tetrandrine). We thus sought to analyze 3/11 these 10 drugs through the DSEA tool in order to understand the common mechanism of action underlying their antiviral effect. These drugs were found by DSEA to modulate targets of the transcription factors (TFs) shown in Table 4 , including: NF-kB, a master regulator of stress response; ATF6, a TF involved in the integrated stress response and with a known role in enhancing herpesvirus gene expression 37 ; STAT5B, a member of the STAT family activated in response to cytokines and growth factor. DSEA also highlighted several biological processes as modulated by these drugs (Table 4) , among which those related to DNA mistmatch repair pathway (MMR). Interestingly, DNA MMR pathway activation has been recently reported to be required for the replication of the coronavirus infection bronchitis virus (IBV) 38 .",

Overall, we found 39 compounds that could be tested experimentally among which NSAIDs, antihistamines, antibiotics and antihelmintics, antipsychotics, corticosteroids, mucolytics and HDAC inhibitors (HDACi). Bromhexine, of which ambroxol is a metabolite, has been recently proposed as a prophylactic treatment for SARS-COV-2 patients 39 based on its reported activity against TMPRSS2 and its over-the-counter availability and safety levels. In our study, we find that ambroxol also induces a transcriptional profile opposite to that induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, adding to the evidence of a possible role of this drug in counteracting the virus. Of interest, HDAC2 was found to interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins 12 and the screening on inhibitors of infection on VERO cells identified several members of the cardiac glycosides as effective 18 . Cardiac glycosides have been recently found to have strong HDACi activity 40, 41 . It will be therefore interesting to verify experimentally whether HDACi have beneficial role in reducing viral replication in host cells. Finally, by interrogating the possible mode of action of positive hits of a drug screening in VERO cells 18 , we identified the DNA MMR pathway as possibly involved in the mode of action of these drugs, and therefore hinting that this pathway could be involved in the host response to the viral infection. Interestingly, HDAC proteins are involved in the modulation of the DNA MMR pathway, thus hinting that HDAC inhibtors, if proven to be effective, may act through this pathway.",
