The particular form and degree of contribution varies significantly from species to species and from individual to individual. Biotic contributions are, in turn, influenced by stochastic abiotic factors such as fluctuations in temperature, rainfall or soil fertility, which impact on individuals and communities at differing local and regional scales (Fridley 2001). The summed contribution of individuals and species has led many ecologists to hypothesize that the maintenance of community function is intimately linked to the level of diversity within a community (Tilman et al. 1996; Fridley 2001). However, debate continues as to the cause and form of the relationship (Cardinale et al. 2000).",

However, germination and establishment on the site was initially highly variable and even in the first year few treatment gradients (number of species, number of functional groups and target number of individuals per plot) were achieved. Consequently, regression analysis was used for statistical modelling, with plots grouped according to the actual characteristics of the vegetation community at the time, rather than the targeted characteristics. Measures were taken from each experimental plot (n = 80), and used to model the relationship between the predictor variables (species number, functional group number, percentage vegetative cover, plant number) and response variables (soil nitrate, PAR) at four separate, seasonal intervals.",

Nine species were identified as idiosyncratic because of their vegetative cover (70% of plot or greater) (Table 4).

A higher number of species per plot were linked to lower available nitrate levels, although this variable explained less than 20% of the observed reduction.

More species initially led to greater cover but subsequently, high levels of cover led to fewer species as competition progressed.

In general, these low nitrate levels are indicative of those in undisturbed or slightly disturbed grassy woodland (<5 mg/kg), whereas >50 mg kg is typical of weed dominated \u2018stock camp\u2019 sites. Nitrate levels where highest in our study in spring (18.7 mg/kg) and progressively declined to 3.5 mg/kg in autumn, not dissimilar to those found in Prober et al. (2005) after the additions of sugar. The levels began to rise again in late winter when such increases would be expected. In spring and summer, when natural peaks seem to occur and when weed vulnerability in an establishing grassland is at its highest, the strength of the relationship between species number and lowered nitrate levels was at its greatest. Therefore, knowing that direct\u2010sown grasslands are particularly vulnerable to competition from weeds (both in\u2010situ and invading propagules), this suggests that restoration strategies might consider the early introduction of high diversity to increase the competitiveness (resource use and biomass accumulation) of the developing communities.",

These observations suggest that, through a combination of rapid niche utilization and increased resource use efficiency, diverse communities may be quicker to consolidate and therefore less vulnerable to invasion by non\u2010target species. As the sown communities began to mature, we found that diversity declined with increasing vegetative cover. This does not reduce resistance to invasion by non\u2010target species while the dominant species responsible for vegetative cover persist. It does, however, indicate that managers must find ways to maintain diversity over time. In particular, our research confirms the findings of others (e.g. Lunt & Morgan 1999) that restoration practitioners should consider the ongoing management of native species that demonstrate a potential to dominate vegetatively. This is especially relevant in mature grasslands where, under favourable rainfall conditions, grass dominants can quickly accumulate biomass to levels that swamp sub\u2010dominant species. Management strategies would include the application of appropriate disturbance regimes such as burning, periodic grazing or mowing, which release resources to the diverse mix of initially sown species.
