On examination, she is anxious-appearing, with a temperature of 38.9 \u00b0C, a heart rate of 120 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min, a blood pressure of 98/64 mmHg, and an oxygen saturation of 94% on 4 L/min oxygen via nasal cannula. A tunneled central venous catheter is in situ in her right internal jugular vein. Her total white blood cell (WBC) count is <0.5 cells/mm 3 and platelet count is 8000 cells/mm 3 . A chest CT scan shows diffuse patchy bilateral infiltrates (Figure) . She is started on empiric antibiotic coverage with piperacillin/tazobactam, and 3 L of crystalloid are administered. Several hours later, she is more hypotensive, with nadir systolic pressures of 80-88 mmHg, and is more hypoxic, now saturating 85% on 6 L/min nasal cannula oxygen.",

The patient was placed on high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) for oxygenation support and started on a norepinephrine infusion for hemodynamic support. Antibacterial coverage was changed to meropenem, levofloxacin, and vancomycin, and voriconazole was added for antifungal coverage. Her central line was removed. Her respiratory status continued to decline, and endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were required 24 h after admission. She was placed on volume assist-control with a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg predicted body weight, and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed. The BAL fluid was initially bloody, but cleared with sequential aliquots. Microbiologic studies of the BAL fluid were positive for respiratory syncytial virus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. She was maintained on low tidal-volume ventilation and vasopressors were weaned off. Her white blood cell count slowly began to recover, and her respiratory status began to improve. She was extubated on hospital day 12 and was discharged from the ICU on hospital day 14.",

            "text": "Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) has become an essential therapeutic modality in the treatment of malignant and non-malignant hematologic disease. In 2016, more than 23,000 HSCTs were performed in the United States, including approximately 15,000 autologous HSCTs and more than 8500 allogeneic transplants [1] . Allogeneic transplants are associated with more morbidity and mortality than autologous transplants, and are further categorized based on conditioning regimen (myeloablative [MA] vs non-myeloablative [NMA]), donor-recipient relation (related vs unrelated), HLA matching (full match vs haploidentical vs mismatched), and stem cell source (bone marrow, peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood). In general, NMA regimens are associated with less peri-transplant morbidity and mortality than fully ablative transplants. In both MA and NMA transplants, the cytotoxic conditioning regimen required in HSCT rapidly induces neutropenia by injuring hematopoietic precursor cells within the bone marrow [2, 3] . Neutropenia persists until donor cell engraftment or bone marrow recovery. The period of aplasia and neutropenia places the HSCT patient at high risk for infectious complications. In addition to the lack of immune cells, the mucosal barrier of the intestinal tract is disrupted by chemotherapy, creating portals through which enteric pathogens can enter the bloodstream [4] [5] [6] . The respiratory system is also more susceptible to infection, with qualitative and quantitative dysfunction of alveolar macrophages, lymphocytes, and neutrophils [7] [8] [9] . Even after the marrow and mucosal surfaces have recovered, the immunological consequences of HSCT can cause further complications requiring critical care. Refinement of transplant techniques over the last 2 decades has dramatically decreased transplant-related mortality, but approximately 15% of HSCT patients require critical care [10] and earlier ICU admission has been associated with improved survival rates [11, 12] . Still, ICU mortality in allogeneic HSCT patients remains approximately 50% [13] .",

Empiric antibiotics must cover common organisms and should be tailored to patientspecific culture data and institutional epidemiology [14, 15] . Appropriate empiric antibiotics include an anti-pseudomonal penicillin or cephalosporin (e.g. piperacillin/tazobactam or cefepime, respectively), or a carbapenem [14, 15] . Vancomycin is not routinely indicated but should be added in the presence of a suspected catheter-related infection, soft tissue infection, oral mucositis, pneumonia, known colonization with resistant gram-positive organisms, or hemodynamic instability [14, 15, 21] . Aminoglycosides should not be added to an anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam unless required by allergies, resistant organisms, or refractory hemodynamic instability [14, 21, [23] [24] [25] . Fluoroquinolones, which are frequently used as prophylaxis in HSCT patients, should not be used as empiric monotherapy due to the likelihood of resistance.",

It is nearly impossible to control delivered tidal volume with NIV and high delivered noninvasive tidal volumes are linked to higher rates of NIV failure [49] . More recent data suggest that NIV may not be beneficial in HSCT patients and heated humidified high-flow oxygen may be a better option [30, [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] .",

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) occurs in up to 12% of patients and is associate with poor outcomes [56, 57] . Diagnosis is most commonly made by observation of progressively bloody aliquots of bronchoalveolar lavage. Steroids are the mainstay of treatment of DAH, with some evidence that efficacy is greatest at doses <250 mg/day of methylprednisolone equivalent [57] . Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) is a form of noninfectious lung injury after HSCT and is clinically defined by diffuse alveolar injury when infection, cardiac dysfunction, renal failure, and volume overload have been excluded [58] . IPS can have many manifestations, including ARDS, pulmonary capillary leak, DAH, or cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. IPS is thought to affect up to 15% of patients after myeloablative allogeneic HSCT, and only ~ 2% of patients after non-myeloablative HSCT. Median time of onset of IPS [35, 42] is 19 days after HSCT and mortality ranges from 60-80% in all patients, with nearly 100% mortality if mechanical ventilation is required [58] . Though the pathophysiology of IPS is incompletely understood, research indicating a pathogenic role for TNF-\u03b1 has led to the use of the anti-TNF-\u03b1 antibody etanercept to treat IPS, with mixed clinical results [59] [60] [61] [62] .",

Grading is based on severity of clinical manifestations, which include skin erythema or maculopapular rash; nausea, emesis, or diarrhea, and elevated bilirubin levels ( Fig. 80.1 , Table 80 .3) [69] [70] [71] [72] .

BOS results from a b c d peribronchiolar fibrosis and obliteration of small airways resulting in the characteristic obstructive physiology [75] . Interstitial and subpleural fibrosis may also occur, resulting in concomitant restrictive physiology. BOS occurs in approximately 3-5% of all patients after allogeneic HSCT, and 14% of those with chronic GVHD, but is likely underdiagnosed [76, 79, 80] . Inhaled corticosteroids appear efficacious in improving FEV 1 in established BOS [81] . Systemic steroids are also commonly used to treat BOS and most patients are maintained on anti-GVHD immunosuppression with tacrolimus, sirolimus, or a calcineurin inhibitor [76] . The combination of inhaled fluticasone, azithromycin, and montelukast (FAM) appears to slow the decline in lung function with BOS [82] but has not yet been proven in a randomized controlled trial. While FAM is standard therapy for established BOS, recent data argue strongly against using azithromycin as prophylaxis against BOS due to decreased survival due to a higher rate of hematologic relapse [83] . Though FAM has been shown to decrease the progression of BOS, mortality due to progressive lung disease remains high, and patients typically present to the ICU with respiratory failure. Unfortunately, with end-stage BOS, there are no effective therapeutic options. A select few patients may be eligible for consideration for lung transplantation, but this is unusual, ",

Management is predominantly supportive, with blood pressure control, cessation of any possible pharmacologic instigators (tacrolimus or cyclosporine), and renal replacement therapy playing major roles.

Similarly, peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are increasingly used for transplant instead of bone marrow stem cells [108] . However, the use of peripheral blood results in a larger number of donor T-cells included in the transplanted stem cells. This higher T-cell dose can result in a profound syndrome of fevers, vascular permeability, hemodynamic instability, acute kidney injury, and respiratory failure. This constellation of findings is associated with elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and has accordingly been labeled as cytokine release syndrome (CRS). While most associated with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy [109] , CRS is increasing recognized after PBSC transplant and is associated with poor outcomes [110] . Emerging data suggest that anti-IL-6 therapy with tocilizumab may improve outcomes, but more research is needed [110] .",

While specialty HSCT ICUs have a number of potential benefits, there are few data to support (or dissuade) their development. Development of best practices for the provision of critical care to HSCT patients, including the optimum ICU organization is an important area for study [48] .
