Failure-to-rescue (FTR) is defined as death after a surgical complication, which is an institution-level surgical safety and quality metric that is an important variable affecting mortality rates in hospitals. This study aims to examine whether complication and FTR are different across low-and high-mortality hospitals for trauma care. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study performed at trauma care hospitals registered at Japan Trauma Data Bank (JTDB) from 2004 to 2017. Trauma patients aged \u2265 15 years with injury severity score (ISS) of \u2265 3 and those who survived for > 48 h after hospital admission were included. The hospitals in JTDB were categorized into three groups by standardized mortality rate. We compared trauma complications, FTR, and in-hospital mortality by a standardized mortality rate (divided by the institute-level quartile). Results: Among 184,214 patients that were enrolled, the rate of any complication was 12.7%. The overall mortality rate was 3.7%, and the mortality rate among trauma patients without complications was only 2.8% (non-precedented deaths). However, the mortality rate among trauma patients with any complications was 10.2% (FTR). Hospitals were categorized into high-(40 facilities with 44,773 patients), average-(72 facilities with 102,368 patients), and low-(39 facilities with 37,073 patients) mortality hospitals, using the hospital ranking of a standardized mortality rate. High-mortality hospitals showed lower ISS than low-mortality hospitals [10 (IQR, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19][20], P < 0.01]. Patients in high-mortality hospitals showed more complications (14.2% vs. 11.2%, P < 0.01), in-hospital mortality (5.1% vs. 2.5%, P < 0.01), FTR (13.6% vs. 7.4%, P < 0.01), and non-precedented deaths (3.6% vs. 1.9%, P < 0.01) than those in low-mortality hospitals.",

Nevertheless, whether FTR in trauma Fig. 1 Conceptualization of the study. Among trauma patients who survived for > 48 h, some patients suffered from complications, while others did not; the proportion of patients with complications is the \"complication rate,\" which is one of the outcome indicators. Those who suffered from complications were more likely to die than those who did not suffer from complications, i.e., the rate of \"failure-to-rescue (FTR),\" which is another outcome indicator, is naturally more than the rate of \"non-precedented deaths.\" Overall in-hospital mortality comprises these components. However, unlike reports of elective surgery, it has been controversial whether complication rate or FTR explains more variations in in-hospital mortality. In addition, FTR in trauma complication studies includes not only patients who have undergone surgery but also those who have not undergone surgery; this is inconsistent with studies on elective surgery. We investigated this research question in the present study care contributes to variations in mortality across centers [7] remains debatable, as there are some concerns regarding the use of FTR as a quality measure of trauma care [11] . First, severe trauma patients die in the hours immediately after injury, although all patients after elective surgery ideally survive. Outcomes after trauma complications may be less modifiable. FTR might play a relatively minor role in trauma patients compared with those after elective surgery. Moreover, with rapid progress in endovascular interventions and intensive care, surgeries for trauma have reduced. Conceivably, complications and FTR should be important in trauma patients regardless of FTR playing a minor or major role. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the association between a complication rate and FTR and a hospital performance level of trauma care in hospitals.",

These variables were chosen based on clinical relevance and a previous study [7] . Next, the predicted probability of death for each patient at each hospital was summed to obtain a predicted mortality rate for each hospital [P c (E)]. In addition, we also calculated an observed in-hospital mortality rate [P c (O)] at each hospital. To yield a standardized mortality rate at each hospital, the overall mortality rate was multiplied by observed to expected [P c (O)/P c (E)] mortality ratio. Finally, hospitals were divided into three by the quartile of standardized mortality rate. We compared the baseline characteristics, treatments, complications, and outcomes by the hospital ranking. Categorical variables were expressed as counts and percentages with comparisons performed using the chi-square test. Continuous variables were expressed as medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) using the Kruskal-Wallis test because our study variables were not normally distributed.",

Complication rates and death after complications (failure-to-rescue) varied across the hospital ranking. The rate of death in patients with complications was almost twice as high in in-hospital patients with high mortality as in those with low mortality (7.4% vs. 13.6, P < 0.01) low-mortality hospitals. However, previous studies [1, 7] showed discordant results regarding the complication rates. A study showed both lower complication rate and lower FTR related to patient's better outcomes [7] , but another study showed lower FTR related to patient's better outcomes despite the similarity in complication rates in each hospital [1] ; this was consistent with a previous report on elective surgery [3] . Our study supported the former [7] . Successful rescue of patients with complications after trauma would have led to lower mortality rates in high-performance hospitals. To improve the quality of trauma care, it is important not only to survive the trauma but also to avoid complications, and to be rescued from complications as well. Therefore, FTR is a reasonable measure of hospital quality that is strongly related to mortality.",

In fact, neither our data nor the report by Haas et al. [7] replicates Ghaferi's results [3] . Trauma complication studies, including our study, recruited not only patients who underwent surgery, but also patients who underwent nonoperative management. Nonoperative management for trauma care has been increasingly mainstream every year. Most of trauma surgeries are also emergency cases. Moreover, complications of trauma are not the same as those with elective surgeries. Therefore, the management of inpatients after trauma such as pneumonia is important, even if they did not undergo surgery.",

A retrospective observational study on non-trauma patients showed that low FTR hospitals had significantly more staffing resources than high FTR hospitals [4] . One study showed surgical intensivists benefited trauma patients [16] . Taken together, these findings highlight the importance of closed intensive care unit staffing (nursing, staffing, education, work environment), a higher proportion of board-certified intensivists, and inpatient support in terms of hospitalists, residents including those with teaching status, overnight care, and dedicated rapid response team in trauma practice. Though staffing and management data were not available for extraction in JTDB, these variables may have been related to reduction trauma surgery with a corresponding increase in endovascular treatment and intensive care. Others have reported that sophisticated technology and larger volumes of hospital and surgeons were modifiable hospital factors that improved FTR, although patient's factors were also related to FTR [14] . A team-based multidisciplinary approach could play an important role in trauma care by reducing judgment errors, delays in diagnosis of trauma, and crucial complications due to errors [17] .",

However, we assessed the timing of the complications based on the type and nature of complications. Some complications like internal diseases might have caused the trauma. Second, complications may have been under-reported leading to Fig. 5 Correlation between failure-to-rescue (FTR) and in-hospital mortality among patients with trauma in all hospitals (n = 148). Each hospital was a bubble, whose size reflects the number of patients with any complication. Only three hospitals reported no patients with any complication. The correlation coefficient (r 2 ) between FTR and in-hospital mortality was 0.0716 (P = 0.39) in all hospitals underestimation or misclassification. Considering the difference in the correlation coefficient in all hospitals and specifically those that contributed to the study, it is plausible for some hospitals to have misdiagnosed or misregistered complications to JTDB. This was corroborated by the authors of a previous study who reported on the inadequate registration of complications [7] . However, another study found no meaningful differences between a registry and a chart review [18] . Thus, fair and accurate reporting of complications is essential for estimating hospital performance. Third, the impact of small hospitals is not known because we excluded hospitals that contributed little to JTDB. Fourth, we did not extract data related to treatments after complications. Fifth, we did not have the data on the type of care provided in different hospitals. We could not specify the type of care administered (unit, team, hospital characteristics, etc.) and as such could not help addressing the much needed better understanding of what made one hospital really better than another. In addition, we could not show which factors lead to better outcomes. Therefore, it might be difficult to identify what we could change at their own institution to improve outcomes. However, we know the importance of prevention of and rescue from complications.",
