A three-minute vascular occlusive test was then performed with an arterial cuff around the arm inflated up to 50 mmHg above the systolic arterial pressure. The rate of tissue oxygen consumption (linear regression of the downslope) and the tissue oxygen consumption at the end of the first minute of ischemia (NirVO2) were measured during the ischemic phase. The vasoreactivity response to hypoxia was measured as the linear regression of the incremental StO2 upslope that followed the arterial cuff release. Finally, the difference between the maximal StO2 and THI following the reperfusion and the baseline values of these variables were computed as \u0394StO2 and \u0394THI.23\n",

Influenza A (H1N1) virus may induce microvascular alterations either directly or indirectly via the stimulation of host inflammatory factors. Administration of tumour necrosis factor (TNF), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, can lead to microcirculatory alterations in animals.27 This new influenza strain is more virulent than seasonal influenza strains and may, therefore, induce microcirculatory impairment by a direct viral effect. Using different mammalian models, Itoh et al.11 demonstrated that one of the first influenza A (H1N1) strains to be isolated was more lethal, persisted longer in the lower airways, caused more intense alveolitis, and induced higher concentrations of inflammatory cytokines in the lungs than a regular seasonal influenza strain. Compared with outpatients, the inflammatory response to severe influenza A (H1N1) is more pronounced in patients with severe disease who require hospitalization, and the response can be observed even in patients who do not have bacterial superinfection.12 The ability of the influenza and other acute respiratory viruses to provoke microvascular alterations\u2014characterized by sludge of capillary flow associated with hypercoagulability and increased blood viscosity\u2014has been suggested by others.28 Therefore, significant microcirculatory perfusion deficits could be an important pathophysiological mechanism in severe influenza A (H1N1) infections.",

The study was not designed to evaluate whether the observed microcirculatory alterations are specific to H1N1 infection or whether they simply reflect the fact that critically ill patients with severe sepsis have disturbed microcirculation. Second, the finding of microcirculatory abnormalities and their correlation with disease severity using two different techniques suggests that endothelial dysfunction may play a role in the pathophysiology of severe H1N1 infections. These findings are in line with other studies in sepsis that relate the severity of microcirculatory abnormalities to the severity of disease.14,22,29\n",
