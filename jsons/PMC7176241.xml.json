Since very small nodules and calcifications are extremely challenging due to rather thick slices and loss of signal, MRI is highly recommended as a follow-up tool, to avoid repetitive investigations using ionizing radiation. With the sensitivity of T2-weighted sequences and the potential of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences, important differential diagnostic considerations can be provided. Additionally, developing complications, such as pericardial or pleural effusions, empyema or lung abscess, are easily recognized. Current and future studies are to demonstrate that MRI is well suited as a monitoring and follow-up tool during and after therapy and compares favorably with CT or other imaging methods regarding sensitivity and specificity.",

HAP is common in patients with severe underlying disease, prolonged antibiotics, intravascular devices, and mechanical ventilation. The latter is also termed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). In a prospective study of 1014 mechanically ventilated patients, VAP developed in 177 patients. The mean time to onset was 9 days, with a median time to onset of 7 days after ICU admission. However, when the daily hazard rate of infection was calculated, it was estimated to be 3.3% at day 5, 2.3% at day 10, and 1.3% at day 15 (Cook et al. 1998). This documents a significant decline in pneumonia risk with time. Because the risk for pneumonia is so high early after intubation, pneumonias beginning within the first 5 days (early-onset infection) account for 50% of all episodes of VAP, and the natural history and pathogens of this infection differ from those associated with VAP of late onset (Prod\u2019hom et al. 1994). Common isolates are gram-negative bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus. Typical radiologic patterns cannot be described. This is due to the different circumstances and risk factors, which contribute to the development of HAP. The other explanations are the different organisms responsible for the pneumonia. Within the first days the more common organisms are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Hemophilus influenzae (Craven and Steger 1995). Later on, gram-negative rods predominate.",

The two patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis showed much lower values of T1, which probably reflects the relative absence of water within the airspaces and the presence of lipoprotein. In general, T1 and T2 values increase in proportion to the water content of fluids or tissue, but they are also influenced by the presence of lipids and by interaction between water and both large and small molecules with which they come in contact (Moore et al. 1986).",

(2002) performed a study without contrast agent and investigated a steady-state free precession sequence (true FISP) as a potential alternative to the conventional X-ray in pediatric patients with suspected pneumonia. A true FISP sequence was chosen because of its high spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in fluid- and thus T2-dominated infectious pulmonary disease. To overcome breathing artifacts in this particular patient group and to increase the S/N ratio, they obtained slice thicknesses of 30\u201355 mm at a 0.2-T low-field MR system. The true FISP sequence had the following parameters: TR 6 ms, TE 3 ms, FA 90\u00b0. The acquisition time for a triple slice scan was 4.8 s, and the door-to-door time was between 10 and 15 min. All pathological findings in the conventional chest X-ray could be identified in the corresponding MR investigation, and the MRI was superior in demonstrating pleural and pericardial effusions. Two small retrocardial pneumonic infiltrates were noted in the MRI only. The authors concluded that this technique could represent an alternative to the conventional chest X-ray (Rupprecht et al. 2002). Such an alternative might be of special interest in children with Nijmegen-Breakage syndrome. This entity is an autosomal recessive chromosomal instability syndrome, characterized by microcephaly, growth retardation, skin abnormalities, immunodeficiency, radiation sensitivity, and a strong predisposition to lymphoid malignancy. Because of their sensitivity to ionizing radiation, X-ray and CT examination should be avoided (Alibek et al. 2007).",

Images were acquired up to 8 days post infection. The virulent strain caused an intense inflammation within 2 days in the whole lungs, while an avirulent strain did not show significant changes. The increase in cell density accompanied with extravascular leakage results in an increase in high water content detectable by MRI. After treatment with antibiotics, the inflammation disappeared after a week. The lesions observed by MRI correlated with the damage seen by histological analysis. In summary, MRI allows observing the appearance and regression of inflammation (Tournebize et al. 2006).",

Ill-defined nodules, ground-glass opacity areas, and consolidations, their location and distribution, and their lesion characteristics (e.g., margin contour, cavitation, calcification) were systematically analyzed. Twenty-two patients had pulmonary abnormalities on CT. In 21 (95%) patients, pneumonia was correctly diagnosed with MRI. One false-negative finding occurred in a patient with ill-defined nodules smaller than 1 cm at CT. One false-positive finding with MR was the result of blurring and respiratory artifacts. That results in a sensitivity of MRI in comparison to 1-mm CT slices of 95%, specificity of 88%, positive predictive value of 95%, and a negative predictive value of 88% (Eibel et al. 2006a). In the detection of ground-glass opacity areas (Figs. 5 and 6), consolidations (Fig. 7), and pleural effusion, MRI seems to be equal to thin-section CT. But the overall detection rate of nodules with MRI was only 72% (186/259). Detailed analyses found out that all nodules larger than 10 mm were reliably detected. The mean size of nodular lesions not found with MRI was 4 mm. This difference likely relates to the section thickness used with CT (1 mm) and MR imaging (6 mm). After this study, the authors came to the conclusion that pulmonary imaging for the detection and quantification of infiltrates is highly reliable with modern MR scanners (Eibel et al. 2006b).\n\n\n",

Despite the benefits of CT in delineating abnormalities in the pulmonary parenchyma, the power in differentiating benign from malignant lesions is limited. This is especially true for the differentiation of pneumonia-like mucinous adenocarcinoma and infectious pneumonia. This type of carcinoma has a rising incidence and carries a poor prognosis. Because of the similarities to pneumonia at radiography and CT, the correct diagnosis is often performed with delay. Gaeta et al. found out that water-sensitive sequences (axial HASTE and coronal RARE) can add substantial information. In this study, the correct diagnoses of mucinous adenocarcinomas and pneumonia on CT images were possible in 74% and 73% for reader 1 and 65% and 80% reader 2, whereas both readers could make the correct diagnosis in 100% of cases with the aid of these two MR sequences. The most important finding was the so-called white lung sign, which is positive due to the high intratumoral content of mucin, but is negative in pneumonia (Gaeta et al. 2011).",

(2012) that MDCT, which can deliver a cumulative radiation dose of approximately 50 mGy, may triple the risk of development of leukemia and that doses of approximately 60 mGy may triple the risk of brain cancer in children. So a major advantage of MRI is the lack of ionizing radiation. But therefore it is necessary to make confident diagnoses on MR images. Gorkem et al. could demonstrate that with contrast-enhanced MDCT findings as the reference standard, unenhanced MRI with fast-imaging-sequences accurately depicted 94% lung abnormalities (consolidation, cystic hydatid disease, bronchiectasis, lung masses and nodules), 100% mediastinal masses, 100% pleural effusions, and 100% chest wall masses. The two undiagnosed findings with MRI were mild bronchiectasis and small pulmonary nodule (3 mm). Taking these results into account, the authors concluded that unenhanced MRI can be the first-line cross-sectional imaging in lieu of contrast-enhanced MDCT. This seems particularly true for pediatric patients who need multiple imaging studies for monitoring diseases (Gorkem et al. 2013).",

In recent development, MRI is increasingly replacing MDCT as the technique for diagnosing complications or monitoring the disease (Wielp\u00fctz et al. 2013). MRI shows the typical changes of bronchiectasis, wall thickening, mucus plugging, and infiltrates (\u201cplus pathologies\u201d on MRI) sensitively and with comparable clinical relevance compared to MDCT (Puderbach et al. 2007). Furthermore, MR perfusion imaging making use of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (Euler-Liljestrand reflex) shows potentially reversible perfusion and ventilation impairment. At present, MRI is being used for the first time in a German multicenter study in the framework of the neonatal cystic fibrosis screening program, providing a secondary surrogate endpoint for preventive treatment strategies (Wielp\u00fctz et al. 2014).",

Explanations are manifold like higher resolution, shorter scan times, availability, patient access during examination, and of course economic factors. Reducing artifacts, receiving more signal, and observing a higher degree of anatomical information will result in longer examination times which on the other hand is limited by the time the patient is able to stop breathing. Therefore, free breathing would be necessary which may lead to respiratory and blurring artifacts.",

They investigated healthy volunteers and patients with lung cancer and pneumonia, while the data were acquired during free respiration in a 90-s scan time. In conclusion, the authors found that this radial TSE sequence in combination with a modified golden-ratio-based reordering offers improved robustness towards motion. This allows for longer scan times over several respiratory cycles, thereby improving the SNR and facilitating high-quality morphological lung MRI which may help to improve the diagnosis of subtle disease. Restrictively, the performance with regard to making the diagnosis of pneumonia or lung cancer earlier, or with more confidence, was not evaluated in this study. Here further work is necessary.",
