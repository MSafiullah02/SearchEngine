The E. spelaea genome assembly exemplifies the 210 power of long-read sequencing technologies in rapid de novo assembly of a non-model 211 genome and alternative-splicing isoform identification. Compared to the hybrid 212 assembled R. aegyptiacus genome, the \"PacBio-only\" assembly was faster, more 213 straightforward and possessed higher contiguous N50 contigs and better repeat-214 resolving with limited gene integrity loss (combined, there are 0.7% more fragmented or 215 missing genes than that of R. aegyptiacus in the BUSCO report, Table 2 ). This slight 216 decrease in gene integrity is probably due to the high depth of short read sequencing, 217 which provided a more complete and uniform coverage across all genome, overall 218 resulting in a better coverage on the gene content. Thus, our study provides a high-219 quality reference genome for use in any future comparative studies. Even without 220 scaffolding, these highly contiguous contigs and FL gene transcripts will be helpful to 221 researchers to extract more accurate genomic loci information of their genes of interest, 222 saving a great amount of energy, resources and time. Our Iso-Seq results have 223 increased our understanding of the complexity of the bat transcriptome and aided in 224 alternative transcript identification. This complexity in the transcriptome of bats is still 225 likely to be underestimated since Iso-Seq was performed at a relatively shallow depth 226   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63 64 65 (~20x coverage) in this study, therefore lowly expressed transcripts could have been 227 missed due to the lack of depth.

The 145 relatively higher number of protein coding genes predicted in E. spelaea compared to P. 146 alecto and R. aegyptiacus is likely due to a more homologous approach being used to 147 predict the gene models of E. spelaea than that of P. alecto and R. aegyptiacus (see 148 Method).

Out of 185 the 20,640 coding genes, we observed 10,033 (5,925 are supported by clean Iso-Seq 186 transcripts) single transcript genes and 10,607 (5,894 are supported by clean Iso-Seq 187 transcripts) alternatively spliced genes. Overall, we found an isoform to gene ratio of 188 1.92 (39,526 transcripts per 20,640 genes) in E. spelaea, which is lower than 3.62 189 (167,430 transcripts per 46,298 genes) in human, but higher than 1.49 (33,093 190 transcripts per 22,264 genes) in P. alecto (Figure 3A). When narrowed down to genes 191 only observed by Iso-Seq, we found an isoform to gene ratio of 2.39 (28,289 transcripts 192 per 11,819 genes), suggesting that the PacBio \u00ae Iso-Seq technology has significantly 193 increased the isoform diversity discovery of E. spelaea's transcriptome compared to that 194 of P. alecto's transcriptome, which was sequenced using the illumina \u00ae RNASeq 195 technology (Fisher Exact Test, p-value < 10 -5 ). 196 The alternative transcript events were further classified into Skipping Exon (SE), 197 Alternative 5'/3' Splice Sites (A5/A3), Mutually Exclusive Exons (MX), Retained Intron 198 (RI) and Alternative First/Last Exons (AF/AL) by SUPPA software (Last updated 199 02/07/2017) [33].

Indeed, comparing the genomes of bats with other mammalian species has 58 revealed an unexpected concentration of positively selected genes. These include those 59 involved in DNA damage repair and innate immune functions, which may partially 60 explain bats' unique tolerance to deadly viruses and their unusually long lifespan [4]. 61 Together, this highlights bats as an emerging model organism in the study of ecology, 62 development, aging and evolution. 63 Accurate assembly and annotation of genomes is a critical first step for further 64 functional studies of genetic variation.
