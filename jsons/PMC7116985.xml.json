The statistics Bureau, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in Japan reported that those who are 65 or over made up the 35.6 million and 28.1% of the total population in Sep. 2018. It is so far the highest proportion in the world. This has increased demand for hospital and welfare facilities for the elderly, and the indoor environment of these facilities has begun to attract considerable attention. A hospital ward is a place where inpatients live and get treated, and they spend most of their time in the infirmary. For this reason, both high indoor air quality and comfortable environment are required. Since a hospital ward is also a workplace for healthcare providers, the indoor environment for workers should also be considered.",

            "text": "Displacement ventilation (DV) is considered to be an attractive ventilation system because of its high effectiveness and air quality [3,4]. Healthy indoor air quality is particularly important in the hospital environment, hence several studies have examined the suitability of DV to hospital wards. Since severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) affected the world in 2003, many studies have focused on whether DV can prevent droplet infection or not. Qian et al. [5] investigated hospital wards with three different ventilation systems: displacement, mixing, and downward ventilation. Their results showed that DV had worse efficiency in removing infectious droplets than other ventilation systems when the lying patient exhaled facing sideways. The exhaled jet from the source manikin penetrated a long distance along the exhaled direction. On the other hand, there are also other studies which have indicated that DV is an effective ventilation system for air infection wards [[6], [7], [8]]. Li et al. [6] examined the exposure risk for the co-occupant under displacement, mixing and underfloor ventilation by the numerical study. As a result, it was found that DV could provide better air quality when the droplet residuals are smaller than 5 \u03bcm and the co-occupant is located a certain distance from the source. Berlanga [7] et al. demonstrated that the exhaled contaminant could go up with the plume of the source manikin successfully when the manikin that exhaled contaminant air was facing up. The suitability of DV for avoiding nosocomial infection is still controversial [9], what is clear is that DV is superior to other ventilation systems when the contaminant is emitted with positive buoyancy force or is combined to the thermal plume of a heat source. Cross-infection control is a paramount issue for ventilation systems of hospitals; however, most nosocomial diseases are communicated by direct and indirect contact rather than airborne route [10]. Furthermore, most hospitals contain a greater number of general wards compared with infection isolation wards, and unpleasant odors in general wards are now highly problematic. Unpleasant odors in the ward are diffused from human bodies or their discharges, and because the human body is also a heat source, these odors are guaranteed to go up with the plume. This paper proposes using a DV system to solve odor issues rather than controlling infections in the hospital ward.",

Local discomfort due to a vertical temperature gradient is often considered as a disadvantage of DV [11]. Moreover, DV cannot be used as a heating system [12], so a complementary heating and cooling system is needed. Inpatients in hospital wards usually lie in a bed, so the vertical temperature gradient would not affect their thermal comfort. However, patients are also more susceptible to the thermal environment than healthy people, and each patient may have different levels of thermal sensitivity depending on their condition [13,14]. Since there was a restriction on the ratio of the one-patient ward, most hospital wards in Japan have more multiple beds. Hence, an individually controllable heating and cooling system is desirable. In this study, a vertical radiant panel that can be personally controlled by a patient was used as an ancillary heating system to acquire a thermally comfortable environment.",

Brohus and Nielsen [15] carried out full-scale measurements of personal exposure and found that standing occupants could inhale cleaner air than the contaminant concentration at the same height because they inhale air inside the boundary layer around bodies. Healthcare providers work on their feet, so it is critical to examine the personal exposure of standing occupants in wards to solve the odor problem.",

Previous studies have already developed several models to predict the vertical temperature profile of a displacement ventilated room [[16], [17], [18], [19]]. However, there are few models for predicting the contaminant concentration distribution. The interface layer is known to be formed at the neutral height, where the supply airflow rate and air flow rate of the convective plumes are equal [20,21]. This neutral height is often considered as a flat line, although there is an intermediate stratified layer between the lower zone and the upper zone because of molecular and turbulent diffusion in actual situations. Lin et al. [22] suggested two-layer stratification model and studied on the thickness of the intermediated stratified layer as well. Yamanaka et al. [23] developed a zonal model that considers diffusion. Suzuki et al. [24] suggested an improved zonal model to predict the contaminant concentration distribution when the contaminated air is locked up. Inagaki et al. [25] and Yamanaka et al. [26] developed a coupled zonal model that can predict the temperature and contaminant concentration profiles simultaneously.",

All envelopes (four walls, ceiling, and floor) were insulated with a 50 mm thick polystyrene layer. The surroundings of the chamber were kept at 23\u201326 \u00b0C throughout the experiments except for the underfloor. Fresh air was supplied from a semicircular wall-mounted diffuser (D = 400[mm], T = 260[mm], H = 750[mm]) that was located on the floor in the middle of the wall. The supply air temperature was maintained at 25 \u00b0C. The exhaust grill had 200\u03c6 holes and was on the ceiling near the wall where the diffuser was placed. Two person simulators were used: one was placed on the bed (manikin A, lying down), and the other was located between P7 and P8 (manikin B, standing). Manikin B was only used in experiments investigating the personal exposure of a standing person. The manikins were wrapped in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) heating cable at equal intervals and put in sweat suits. The heat generation from manikin A was controlled at 40 W, and the heat generation from manikin B was controlled at 75 W to represent the sensible heat load. CO2 was used as the tracer gas to simulate the odor from the human body and was distributed from a tube on manikin A. The CO2 flow rate was controlled at 0.5 L/min with a mass flow controller. The tube for inhalation was placed on the face of manikin B. Inhalation was assumed to be steady, and the inhaled air was maintained at 14.4 L/min to represent the average amount of one breathing cycle [27]. For the vertical radiant panel, hot water was provided from a water tank installed outside the chamber. The surface temperature of the radiant panel was monitored, and the water temperature was controlled to achieve the target surface temperature with the heater and cooler inside the water tank.",

In order to identify the positional relation between the panel and the bed, D\np and H\np were changed. Since the contaminant air was locked when D\np = 0.4 m in the pilot study, D\np was altered within the range of 0 m\u20130.4 m. H\np was set to 0.4 m, as high as the bed. Both H\np = 0.2 and 0.8 m were also chosen to examine when the lower end of the panel is lower or higher than the bed. The radiant panel was heated at 40 \u00b0C, which is higher than the human body temperature but not high enough to cause a danger from burns. The panel surface temperature was controlled at 23 \u00b0C for cooling and 30 \u00b0C for the neutral condition for reference. Q\ns = 200 m3/h was chosen as the standard condition because it was confirmed that the interface was formed higher than the breathing zone of lying and sitting person in the pilot study. Q\ns = 100 and 300 m3/h were adopted to carry out the measurement under the several height conditions of the contaminant interface.",

The vertical temperature differences and the temperature gradients were almost the same under the different D\np conditions. It indicates that D\np did not have much effect on the temperature distribution. There was no significant difference between cases in terms of the vertical concentration profile on the non-heating side of the panel. The contaminant interface height formed at the same level. On the other side, the contaminated air from manikin A was trapped in all cases on the heating side of the panel except for D\np = 0 m. When there was no space between the panel and bed, the plumes from the manikin A and panel merged into one plume and were efficiently exhausted. However, the locked-up phenomenon appeared when D\np was even only 0.05 m. It indicates that, when there was no space between the two heat sources, fresh air in the lower part of the room was entrained into the plume of the panel, and the two plumes rose separately. For this reason, the weaker plume from manikin A stagnated at a lower level and was unable to rise directly to the ceiling.",

Although the panel surface temperature was higher than the supply air temperature, the air temperature of the lower part had negative values in case of T\np = 30 \u00b0C. The heat loss was relatively large compared to heat generation in this case (Table 2, Case 4). The room air temperature must have been higher than the supply air if the room was completely insulated. As T\np increased, the heat load in the room became larger. This caused the vertical temperature gradient to increase.

The calculated stagnation heights were close to the measured results. On the other hand, the concentration of the stagnation height did not correspond well with the measured results. However, whether the stagnation occurs and where it is located are more critical to predict rather than the contaminant concentration at the stagnation. As D\np gets larger, the concentration at the stagnation height becomes higher in the experiment results; nevertheless, there was no significant difference in the calculated results. When the radiant panel is close to the bed, the contaminant plume from the manikin would be entrained to the upward flow along the panel partially. If the panel is thoroughly far from the panel, two plumes would move individually. In this model, the change of the plume movement due to the distance between plumes was not reflected. Although the contaminated air was assumed to be equally divided among the upper and lower zones of the stagnation height, the actual situation may be different. The calculated stagnation height was higher than the measured results when the panel was located in the lower part (Fig. 13 (d)). The linearized temperature gradient between near the ceiling and floor was used to calculate the stagnation height. Accordingly, the calculated temperature gradient in the lower part was smaller than the actual temperature distribution, and the predicted stagnation height was higher than the measured results.",

Several panel conditions were changed to investigate their influence on the temperature and contaminant concentration distribution in a displacement ventilated room. Additionally, the zonal model and improved zonal model were applied to predict the contaminant concentration profiles. The following conclusions were obtained.\u2022When a vertical radiant panel is utilized for heating, it generates a stronger plume than the lying manikin, which diffuses contaminated air. For this reason, the contaminated air is trapped on its way to the ceiling, and the contaminant concentration of the stagnation level is higher than the concentration of the exhaust air. In contrast, if the radiant panel is utilized as a cooling system, the downward flow along the panel descends by entrainment near the contaminated air. Hence, the contaminant concentration at the lower level is higher than general DV. These results indicate that the location of the vertical radiant panel is important when it is used as a complementary heating or cooling system with DV. When it is heated, the radiant panel and contaminant source should be placed close together. The influence of convection flow from the heat source on the contaminant concentration distribution is profound; thus, an auxiliary heating or cooling system for DV should be examined thoroughly.\u2022If the supply airflow rate increases, the height of the interface layer and stagnation also go up. The height of the heat source influences the temperature and contaminant distributions.\u2022The personal exposure of a standing person is less than the contamination of the surrounding air at the breathing zone height because the person inhales the air inside the boundary layer around the person. When the contaminated air is locked up, the concentration of the inhaled air increases. Although personal exposure would become close to the concentration of the ambient air when a person is moving, a person who stays standing up for some time could benefit from this effect. In order to predict the personal exposure more accurately, it is essential to examine the plume around the body.\u2022The zonal model is valid for predicting the contaminant concentration profile when there is no stagnation. The calculated results were consistent with the experimental results in all cases. However, the downward flow along the wall affects the stratification height and contaminant concentration of the occupant zone, so its influence should be further studied. On the other hand, there is good correspondence between the measured concentration profiles and calculated results with the improved zonal model. The stagnation height is accurately predicted if the temperature gradient is properly applied. The movement mechanism of the trapped air should be investigated to increase the accuracy of the improved zonal model.\n",
