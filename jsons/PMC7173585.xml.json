In the next 24 h, neck emphysema was observed and due to the imminent respiratory failure, the girl was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). The child was sedated, relaxed, and mechanically ventilated. The leukocyte count was 22.0\u00d7109/liter, the C-reactive protein level was 14 mg/liter, and hemoglobin concentration was 9.4 g/dl. Her medical condition failed to improve and her circulatory stability was supported by intermittent intravenous saline boluses with continuous infusion of dopamine. Repeated chest radiography revealed pneumothorax of the left and the right lung, which were immediately drained. Bronchoscopy performed through endotracheal tube showed edema and inflammation of the lower respiratory tract with a large amount of mucus. Carbon dioxide partial pressure increased, and after 18 h after ICU admission reached 19.6 kPa, with excessive respiratory acidosis (pH 6.92).",

However, in 2009 the HBoV1 was successfully cultured in primary airway epithelial cells differentiated into pseudo-stratified human airway epithelium.47 It has been demonstrated that the transcription profile of HBoV1 displays features similar to bovine parvovirus 1 (BPV1) and minute virus of canines (MVC), which also belong to genus Bocavirus.47 In 2012 the establishment of a reverse genetic system for studying HBoV1 in human airway epithelia (HAE) has enabled better understanding of HBoV1 replication and pathogenesis.10\nThe full-length genome of HBoV1 was sequenced for the first time, and cloned into a plasmid. It was demonstrated that the infectious clone was capable of replicating and producing progeny virions in the absence of a helper virus in polarized differentiated human embrionic kidney cells (HEK 293). The infectious virions are able to infect polarized differentiated human airway epithelia from both apical and basolateral surfaces.10., 48., 49. HBoV1 infection disrupts the integrity of HAE by disruption of the tight barrier junction and leads to loss of cilia and airway epithelial cell hypertrophy. The permissiveness of the HBoV1 infection is dependent on various steps including virus attachment, entry, intracellular trafficking, and DNA replication, and all of these steps need to be investigated.10 It has been shown that infection caused by MVC, which is most closely related to HBoV1, triggers the intra-S-phase arrest to slow down the host cellular DNA replication and, by activation of host DNA damage response, recruit the cellular DNA replication system for viral DNA replication.50 It was demonstrated that HBoV1 NP1 induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in Hela cells, suggesting that amino acids at the N-terminal domain of NP1 protein may be critical for the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction in mammalian cells. The apoptotic cell death is mediated by mitochondrion pathway independent of viral genome replication or viral protein expression.49\n",

It is also possible that the HBoV1 genome can be presented as an episome with prolonged gene expression and replication.10., 51., 52.\n",

Detection of IgM antibodies and/or four-fold increase in IgG titer between acute and convalescent serum indicates recent infection. It has been shown that primary infections diagnosed serologically or by the presence of HBoV1 DNA in serum have been linked to respiratory symptoms.3., 22., 64. It has been shown that HBoV1 mono-infection, high HBoV1 viral load determined by PCR, and viremia are associated with respiratory tract infection.64 In one study, 94% of wheezing children with serologically verified HBoV1 infection were viremic.22 In wheezing children with high HBoV1 DNA load in the nasopharynx, the HBoV1 IgM or an increase of IgG was detected in 96%, compared with 38% of those with low HBoV1 DNA load.22\n",
