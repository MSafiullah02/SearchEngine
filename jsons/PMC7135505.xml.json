The third patient is an adult woman who developed a respiratory illness on February 5 after contact with the index patient after he was hospitalized.5, 10 She did not require hospitalization and had recovered by February 19.5, 6 Only the index patient had traveled recently outside the United Kingdom. In accordance with their ongoing investigation of this cluster of illnesses, the UK Health Protection Agency has concluded that person-to-person transmission likely occurred in the United Kingdom within this family.6\n",

Persons who develop severe acute lower respiratory illness of known cause within 10 days after traveling from the Arabian Peninsula or neighboring countries but who do not respond to appropriate therapy may be considered for evaluation for novel coronavirus infection. In addition, persons who develop severe acute lower respiratory illness who are close contacts of a symptomatic traveler who developed fever and acute respiratory illness within 10 days of traveling from the Arabian Peninsula or neighboring countries may be considered for evaluation for novel coronavirus infection.
