The post-nuclear supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 10 min and was then placed on a 30% (w/w) sucrose cushion for centrifugation at 34,000 rpm for 20 h.

Twenty-eight fractions, monitored at a wavelength of 280 nm, were extracted from the centrifuged sucrose gradient using a density gradient fractionation system (ISCO). Each fraction of sucrose gradient was separated on 12% SDS\u2013PAGE and then transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Immobilin-P, Millipore).

            "text": "In order to determine if the SARS-CoV 3a protein can be secreted, cell lysates and culture supernatants from metabolically labeled SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal anti-3a antibody. As shown in Fig. 1\nA, a specific protein band of \u223c35 kDa was detected in cell lysates obtained from SARS-CoV infected cells but not in cell lysates from mock infected cells (lanes 1 and 2). Therefore, 3a was expressed in the SARS-CoV infected cells, which is consistent with previous studies [30]. The 3a protein was also specifically immunoprecipitated from the culture supernatant of SARS-CoV infected cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4), indicating that 3a protein was secreted into the culture supernatant. Consistently, Zeng et al. [15] recently reported the detection of disulfide-linked complexes of S and 3a in the culture supernatant of SARS-CoV infected cells. Four other proteins, with molecular weights less than 35 kDa, in the cell lysates also co-immunoprecipitated with 3a (Fig. 1A, lane 2). The sizes of these proteins are \u223c24, \u223c20, \u223c15, and \u223c8 kDa and they could be host or viral proteins that bound to 3a or they could be cleaved/degraded forms of 3a. The smallest of these co-immunoprecipitated proteins (\u223c8 kDa) and another protein of \u223c10 kDa that co-immunoprecipitated with 3a from the culture supernatant have similar molecular weight to that predicted for the E protein (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 4). As the interaction between 3a and E has been previously demonstrated [13], it is likely that the E protein (\u223c8 and \u223c10 kDa in the cell lysate and culture supernatant, respectively) expressed in the infected cells has co-immunoprecipitated with 3a. Interestingly, the relative amount of E to 3a in the immuno-complexes from culture supernatant was significantly higher when compared to the cell lysate, suggesting that 3a may need to be complexed with E before secretion out of the cells, whilst there was a pool of free 3a intracellularly. The molar ratios of E:3a, as computed by quantification of the autoradiograph shown in Fig. 1A, were 3:2 in the culture supernatant and 7:8 in the cell lysate. Based on this assumption, we estimated that the molar ratio of E to 3a in the virion is 3:2. It should be noted that this is only an approximation and future analysis of highly purified virus samples by immunoprecipitation with specific monoclonal antibodies, as recently described for transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus by Escors et al. [31], will be required to determine an accurate stoichiometric ratio of 3a in the virion relative to E and the other structural proteins.",

Due to the highly contagious nature of the SARS-CoV, it was not feasible to subject SARS-CoV to the standard sucrose gradient purification. Instead, the virus was subjected to size exclusion chromatography and the presence of virion in the eluted fractions was confirmed by electron microscopy studies (data not shown). As this was performed as part of a vaccine development program at the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products (China), infected cells were collected at late infection (90% CPE) in order to obtain the highest titer of virus. Western blot analysis showed that two truncated forms of 3a, \u223c24 and \u223c20 kDa, were detected in purified virion using specific anti-3a antibody (Fig. 1B, lane 3). These two truncated forms of 3a may correspond to the two protein bands of the similar sizes observed in Fig. 1A (lane 2). Curiously, the full-length 3a was not easily detectable although it was clear that the full-length 3a was expressed in and secreted from the infected cells at earlier phase of infection (50% CPE) (Fig. 1B, lane 2 and results above). No cellular tubulin, which is highly abundant in the cell lysates, was associated with the purified virion (Fig. 1B, lanes 1\u20133), indicating that the purification process successfully eliminated proteins that were not associated with the virion.",

The results showed that 3a can indeed be cleaved into smaller products by 2 days post-transfection. Collectively, the probable explanation for our observation of only truncated forms of 3a in the virion is that the virion was purified from infected cells at a much later phase of infection and that 3a is sensitive to cleavage over time. Unfortunately, it was not possible to repeat the purification of virion from an earlier phase of infection as the incidents of laboratory acquired SARS-CoV infections [32] have led to a restriction on unnecessary protocols, like purification of virions that requires high virus titer and specialized instrumentations, using live SARS-CoV.",

The S protein could also be incorporated into VLPs when it is expressed together with M and E [22], [23]. In order to determine if SARS-CoV 3a protein can be incorporated into VLPs, insect cells co-expressing 3a, M, and E were subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation, followed by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3\nA, the 3a protein was found mainly in the fractions 17 and 18. The same fractions also contained the majority of the M and E proteins (Figs. 3B and C). Previously, electron microscopy showed that VLPs containing S were also found in fraction 17, which corresponded to 43% (w/w) sucrose and a density of 1.2 mg/ml [22]. Therefore, our data showed 3a, like the S protein, is not essential for the formation of VLPs but it is incorporated when present. In addition, both the full-length 3a and the truncated 3a were efficiently incorporated into VLPs, which is consistent with the observation of truncated 3a products in virions purified from SARS-CoV infected cells (Fig. 1B). In the VLPs from insect cells (Fig. 3A), the 3 forms of 3a observed were also similar in size to those observed in the purified virion, i.e., \u223c35 kDa (and \u223c32 kDa, which was not clearly resolved from the 35 kDa band) for full-length 3a, \u223c24 and \u223c20 kDa for the truncated products, indicating that the post-translational modifications of 3a in insect and mammalian cells were similar. However, the relative amounts of the different forms of 3a in virus or virus-like particles obtained from these 2 systems were quite different. In insect cells, the percentages of the 35, 24, and 20 kDa, products are 23%, 35%, and 42% respectively (Fig. 3A, fraction 17). And in mammalian cells, the corresponding percentages are 7%, 32%, and 61% respectively (Fig. 1B, lane 3). This indicates that the kinetics of processing as well as the incorporation into virions in insect and mammalian cells may not be identical.",

Interestingly, when Liu et al. [33] used phage-display technology to characterize B cell epitopes recognized by antibodies from SARS patients, they found one consensus motif VKIXN which corresponded uniquely to 18\u201322 amino acids of the N-terminus ectodomain of 3a. Detailed studies, like electron microscopy analysis, will be necessary to determine the precise topology of full-length 3a (and its truncated products) in virus particles. As 3a can interact with S, M, and E proteins [13], [15], it is also critical to determine how these viral\u2013viral interactions contribute to the incorporation of 3a and/or S into the virion. Interestingly, sequence comparison of isolates from different clusters of infection showed that both S and 3a [15], [34], [35] showed a positive selection during virus evolution. Collectively, these findings suggest that 3a could play important roles during viral infection, replication, and/or pathogenesis. Future studies will yield more information on the structural and functional significance of the incorporation of 3a into virions of SARS-CoV and such knowledge may have important implications for anti-viral or vaccine developments.",

(A) 35S metabolically labeled cell lysates or culture supernatants from mocked infected (lanes 1 and 3) or SARS-CoV infected cells (lanes 2 and 4) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-3a polyclonal antibody. The 3a protein(s) or proteins that interacted with 3a were detected in SARS-CoV infected cells (marked by arrowheads, lanes 2 and 4), but not in mocked infect cells. (B) Western blot analysis, using specific anti-3a antibody (top panel), to detect for the expression of 3a in cells lysates obtained from mock infected cells (lane 1), SARS-CoV infected cells (lane 2), and in virions purified from SARS-CoV infected cells (lane 3). Cells transiently transfected with a DNA construct for expressing 3a were harvested at 1 or 2 days post-transfection and subjected to Western blot analysis (lanes 4 and 5). Untransfected Vero E6 was included as negative control (lane 6). The amounts of total cell lysates loaded for each samples were verified by measuring the level of endogenous tubulin (bottom panel). Note that no tubulin was present in the purified virion (lane 3).",
