            "text": "An increasing number of studies have reported gastrointestinal symptoms and liver injury in patients with COVID-19, and patients with severe disease tend to have an increased risk of developing gastrointestinal symptoms and abnormal liver function. 2 However, results have been inconsistent, with high heterogeneity among studies, and the exact magnitude of gastrointestinal and liver involvement remains uncertain. Compared with adult patients, paediatric patients (aged <18 years) seem to have clinically milder symptoms and show less severe alterations in radiological and laboratory testing parameters. 8 Whether paediatric patients have a lower risk of gastrointestinal and liver involvement remains unclear. Moreover, several studies have provided information on the epidemiology and clinical manifes tation of the disease outside of Hubei province, China. Whether gastrointestinal manifestations and liver injury in patients in Hubei differ from those outside Hubei has seldom been investigated. 9, 10 More importantly, the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 with gastrointestinal symptoms is still largely unknown. Studies 11, 12 implied that patients with COVID-19 with digestive symptoms might have a worse clinical outcome than those without digestive symptoms, emphasising the importance of including symptoms such as diarrhoea to diagnose COVID-19 early. In one study, 11 the rate of severe or critical disease was also markedly increased in patients with COVID-19 with gastrointestinal symptoms compared with in those without gastro intestinal symptoms. Moreover, patients with COVID-19 with gastrointestinal symptoms had significantly higher rates of complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome and liver injury than did those without these symptoms. 11 Pan and colleagues 12 also showed that as the severity of the disease increased, digestive symptoms became more pronounced.",

An increasing number of studies have reported gastrointestinal symptoms and liver injury in patients with COVID-19, and patients with severe disease tend to have a higher risk of developing gastrointestinal symptoms and abnormal liver function. However, results have been inconsistent, with high heterogeneity among studies, and the exact magnitude of gastrointestinal and liver involvement is uncertain. Detailed pooled estimates of the prevalence of gastrointestinal and liver involvement in COVID-19 are needed. Whether this unique group of patients has a poor disease course remains unclear.

Compared with patients with non-severe disease, patients with severe COVID-19 had a higher risk of developing gastrointestinal symptoms and liver injury. Children with COVID-19 had a similar prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms as did adults with COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 in Hubei had a higher prevalence of abnormal liver functions than those outside of Hubei. Approximately 10% of patients with COVID-19 might present with gastrointestinal symptoms only, without respiratory symptoms. Patients with digestive system involvement as initial symptoms have delayed diagnosis of COVID-19, and those with digestive involvement have a tendency to progress to severe or critical disease and a poor disease course. Increased attention should be paid to the early identification of these patients. and \"COVID-19.\" Considering the urgency of the topic and the need to increase the sensitivity of the search, a grey literature search was done using the same keywords on Google Scholar to capture the most recently published articles. Furthermore, COVID-19 publications in the WHO database of publications, The Lancet COVID-19 Resource Centre, New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA, BMJ, Gastroenterology, Gut, American Journal of Gastroenterology, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were screened for potentially relevant publications, included accepted pre-proof publications. Additional articles were retrieved by screening the reference lists of included studies and from the archives of the reviewers. The literature search was restricted to articles published in English. One of the reviewers (YQ) with experience in database searches designed the search strategy, which was subsequently revised by other authors. Because of the large number of records identified from the grey literature, the Google Scholar search was limited to titles. However, no additional limits were applied in the PubMed, Embase, or Web of Science searches. Records were managed with EndNote (version X9.0) to exclude duplicates.",

            "text": "In addition to digestive symptoms, patients with COVID-19 are also at risk of developing liver injury. Studies have shown that patients had varying degrees of liver function abnormalities-the incidence ranged from 1% to 53%-mainly indicated by abnormal ALT and AST concentrations, accompanied by slightly increased bilirubin concentrations. Albumin was decreased in severe cases (around 26\u00b73-30\u00b79 g/L). 32 Our findings indicate that one in five patients will develop liver function abnormalities, especially in patients with severe disease, thus close attention should be paid to liver dysfunction when treating patients with COVID-19 over the hospitalisation period. Liver injury was characterised by slight increases in hepatocyte-related enzymes, including ALT and AST. Cholangiocyte-related enzymes, such as alkaline phosphatase and \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase, were also reported to be slightly increased in a few patients. 65 Studies on the exact mechanism of COVID-19-related liver injury are scarce. Liver abnor malities of patients with COVID-19 may be due to viral infection in liver cells or other causes such as drug toxicity and systemic inflammation. 66 A post-mortem biopsy study in a patient with COVID-19 showed moderate micro vascular steatosis and mild lobular and portal activity, indicating that the 67, 68 Similar to the situation in patients with SARS, drugs such as antivirals might cause liver injury in patients with COVID-19. 69 However, one study reported that no significant difference in the prevalence of liver injury existed between patients on medication versus those who were not, when stratified by pre-hospital medications, including antibacterial drugs, antiviral drugs (abidol, oseltamivir, acyclovir), and antipyretic drugs such as paracetamol. 68 Further studies are warranted in this setting. A link between gastrointestinal involvement and disease severity of COVID-19 has been proposed. In a multicentre study, Pan and colleagues 12 investigated the prevalence and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 with digestive symptoms. In 99 patients who presented with digestive symptoms as their chief complaint, a longer time from onset to admission was observed compared with patients without digestive symptoms (9\u00b70 days vs 7\u00b73 days). As the severity of the disease increased, digestive symptoms became more numerous. Patients without digestive symptoms were more likely to be cured and discharged than were patients with digestive symptoms (60% vs 34%). 12 This finding was consistent with the study from Wang and colleagues, 33 who found that patients admitted to the ICU were more likely to have abdominal pain and loss of appetite compared with non-ICU patients. 33 We did subgroup analyses to investigate the difference in gastrointestinal symptoms between patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19. We found a higher prevalence of gastro intestinal symptoms, including loss of appetite, and abdominal pain in patients with severe COVID-19 than in those with non-severe disease. Cai and colleagues 37 showed that liver injury occurred more frequently in patients with severe disease than in patients with non-severe disease. We also found a significantly higher risk of liver function abnormalities in those with severe disease than in those with non-severe disease. In patients with COVID-19 who died, the incidence of liver injury might reach as high as 58% 70 or 78%. 71 One study reported that serum ALT increased up to 7590 U/L and AST up to 1445 U/L in a patient with severe COVID-19. 32 We further investigated the disease course and outcomes in subgroups of patients with digestive system involve ment. We found that patients presenting with initial gastrointestinal symptoms only had longer duration from illness onset to hospital admission. The rate of severe or critical illness was markedly increased in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms than in those without. Patients with gastrointestinal symptoms also had an increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome. No significant difference was seen when considering pooled rates of discharge, length of hospital stay, and rates of death between patients with and without gastrointestinal symptoms. This finding might be due to the somewhat low incidence of each event.",

Patients in Hubei had a higher risk of presenting with abnormal liver function than did those outside of Hubei. One explanation is that Hubei might have had more patients with severe disease compared with outside of Hubei, which might result in the higher percentage of patients with abnormal liver function in Hubei. However, the studies included in our analysis did not show significant differences in the proportion of patients with severe disease between Hubei and outside of Hubei (data not shown).

In an investigation 8 of ten paediatric patients, eight (80%) persistently tested positive on rectal swabs even after nasopharyngeal tests became negative. 8 Our pooled estimate of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA positivity in faecal samples was 54% (95% CI . Viral positivity can persist for as long as 47 days after symptom onset (appendix p 6). 61 Data from Wu and colleagues 60 suggest the possibility of extended duration of viral shedding in faeces, for nearly 5 weeks after the patients' respiratory samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. However, the clinical impli cations of prolonged viral excretion in faeces, including the association with disease course, severity, and even recurrence of COVID-19, remains unclear. More studies are needed to show the virus' replication competence, abundance in stool, and stability in the environment. 72, 73 This meta-analysis has several potential limitations. First, an assessment of the methodological quality showed deficiencies in the studies assessed-all 35 studies included were considered to be of low quality. Second, because of insufficient data reported in the original publications, we could not assess the effects of other factors, such as sex, age, and comorbidities, on the rate of gastrointestinal symptoms at diagnosis and risk of liver injury. Third, the criteria for severe COVID-19 differed among studies, which might have contributed to the heterogeneity of the meta-analysis. Last, significant heterogeneity and publication bias were observed in our study for estimating the prevalence of digestive system symptoms. After reviewing each study, the non-specific symptom of appetite loss and two studies 40,49 that were focused on patients with gastro intestinal symptoms contributed to most of the hetero geneity. When these studies were excluded from the analysis, the pooled prevalence of digestive symptoms was with modest heterogeneity. The pooled rates of the other three symptoms (nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea, and abdominal pain) were similar to our original results, with only mild or modest heterogeneity.",

Children with COVID-19 had a similar risk of gastrointestinal symptoms to that of adult patients. A tenth of patients with COVID-19 might present only with gastrointestinal symptoms without respiratory symptoms; such patients could have delayed diagnosis. Patients with gastro intestinal symptoms have a tendency to develop severe or critical disease and have a poor disease course. Increased attention should be paid to the care of this unique group of patients.",
