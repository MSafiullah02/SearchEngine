            "text": "The two main transmission routes for respiratory infections are by droplet spread and by the airborne route. Droplet spread involves relatively large droplets containing organisms that settle out of the air quickly. It requires direct contact of droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking onto the mucous membranes of recipients for transmission, necessitating contact at close range (usually within 1 m). The common cold is an example of an infection spread predominantly by this route. Airborne transmission involves dissemination of tiny suspensions of microbial particles (droplet nuclei) that can remain suspended in the air for prolonged periods. Droplet nuclei are usually 1\u201310 \u00b5m in size, can disperse widely and rapidly in closed environments with a recirculation ventilation system and can easily be drawn into the bronchioles of recipients\u2019 respiratory tracts. Transmission by this route can lead to infections in a large number of people. Tuberculosis (TB) and smallpox can spread in this way. Some infections, such as influenza and measles, can be spread by both routes, but are predominantly spread by the indirect airborne route. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is predominantly spread by droplets, but airborne transmission and transmission by contact with contaminated fomites can also occur\n4\n.",

Even if the supplied cabin air is sterile, microbial contaminants can be introduced by passengers. It has been demonstrated that passengers\u2019 respiratory tract flora can be isolated from cabin surfaces and air, indicating a potential for transmission of diseases spread by respiratory droplets\n11\n. However, there is a common misconception among the travelling public that if one person on board an aircraft has an infection, then all other passengers are at risk. Because air flow is generally from top to bottom, with little if any front to back flow, and because respiratory pathogens are diluted by frequent air exchanges, passengers at most risk are those in close proximity to the infected passenger, with minimal risk for others. The relative infectiousness of the ill passenger will thus be an important factor in the risk of transmission.",

This is because outside air entering the cabin at altitude is essentially sterile, heating/cooling further reduces microbial risks, HEPA filters remove microorganisms from recirculated air and the low humidity, high airflow rates, laminar airflow pattern and frequent air exchanges incorporated into the cabin ventilation and pressurization systems further minimize microbial contamination on board aircraft. When transmission does occur, it is more likely with pathogens spread predominantly by the airborne route, but it requires close exposure to an infected individual, in which case transmission would be likely to occur regardless of the mode of transportation. Individuals with significant communicable illness, particularly respiratory infections, should postpone commercial air travel to prevent transmission to others, although the overall risk is very low.
