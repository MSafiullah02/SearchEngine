Such research to commercial ends tends to be regarded as beyond the proper use of public funds. Hence, discoveries and inventions that might lead to the discovery of a new drug made in the institutions conducting such academic research, have tended to be licensed to traditional pharma, possibly via a university technology transfer office. However, in many cases, particularly entrepreneurial scientists have elected to commercialize the IP themselves by founding a company, and a new SME (biotechnology sector company) is born.",

The first is an IPO, where the public is invited to subscribe to the shares of the company and the venture capitalists are then able to liquidate a part, or all, of their shareholding. The timing of IPOs is very market-sensitive, not only to the individual company prospects but also to the public and analysts\u2019 perception of the industry sector as a whole. The so-called IPO windows can open and close in very short timeframes. Despite good news on a company's prospects (for example, Edinburgh (Scotland)-based Ardana Biosciences released a press release claiming that its prostate cancer treatment, Teverelix, was successful in phase II clinical trials9), sometimes IPOs fail to raise the money expected or needed. Ardana Bioscience achieved an IPO on Alternative Investment Market (AIM) in March 2005 but the share price achieved (\u00a31.28) was apparently disappointing. It did, however, net Ardana some $38 million to $32 million after expenses. In certain cases, IPOs can be withdrawn at short order when a healthcare bad-news story impacts public confidence in share subscriptions, as occurred with the UK-based company Phytopharm (a company specializing in natural product research) in March 2005. Boston-based US SME/biotech CombinatoRx was due for an IPO in March 2005, and Valera Pharmaceuticals registered on Monday 14 March 2005 for an IPO of up to $74.75 million in common stock, according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.10 The second typical VC exit from an SME is described in Section 1.13.3.3, below.",

The Biospace website has dubbed this concentration of SME/biotech companies \u2018Genetown\u2019 and in 2005 listed some 206 companies in the area. Notable companies include Biogen (now merged with San Diego-based IDEC to form Biogen Idec), Vertex, Millennium, Sepracor (all of these biotechnology companies have grown beyond the scope of this chapter's definition of an SME), Affymetrix, Ariad, Arqule, Cubist, Curis, En Vivo Pharmaceuticals, Leukocyte (acquired by Millennium), Momenta, Oscient, and Repligen. In the US, the geographical concentration in the Boston area has become so important to the world drug discovery science base that the desire of the traditional large pharma companies to overcome geographical inertia and move their scientists to this biotech/university cluster has occurred. Both Merck and Novartis have built large research centers in Boston, MA since 2000.",

The Group of Povl Krogsgaard\u2013Larsen at the Royal Danish School of Pharmacy has long conducted research into the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, including research into muscarinic and nicotinic acid receptors. In 2002, the Boston Consulting Group published a 70-page report on Medicon Valley, which is available on the Medicon Valley website.16 This report shows that this particular biotech cluster also owes much of its existence to a concentration of large and medium-sized pharma in the region: Pharmacia (much of which is now Biovitrum), AstraZeneca, Leo, Lundbeck and NovoNordisk, which have spawned a large number of SME companies. The Boston Consulting Group report16 considers that the Medicon Valley diabetes research cluster is probably the strongest in the world, and there is also a strong emphasis on antiinflammatory and neuroscience drug discovery. Notable drug discovery and associated companies that are SMEs in Medicon Valley are 7-TM Pharma, Acadia Pharmaceuticals, BioImage, Zealand Pharmaceuticals, Maxygen, Pharmexa, Topotarget, and Active Biotech.",

The mergers of Fujisawa and Yamanouchi, announced in 2004, and the ambition of companies like Takeda may allow the emergence of similar concentrations of SMEs, but hitherto there are few such companies.

The rise of biologicals as pharmaceutical therapies based upon the molecular biology technologies of the 1980s and 1990s allowed several companies (Amgen, Genentech, Biogen Idec, and Chiron) that began life as SMEs to become world-class players in their own rights before or despite the best efforts of big pharma to compete with them or acquire them. Indeed, with the exception of Genentech (now majority-owned by Roche), the remainder have maintained their independence. It is, however, salient to realize that all these SMEs that have become big pharma players in their own rights were established to research and develop biological agents (antibodies, proteins) rather than (in the first instance) small molecules. Only subsequently, after success gained by getting biological products on the markets, have some turned to small-molecule research. The major success stories of SMEs turning into major competitors of traditional big pharma are shown in Table 4\n. Clearly, in the first tier (market capitalizations over $25 billion) are Amgen and Genentech (actually majority-owned by Roche but still separately quoted); in the second tier (market capitalizations greater than $5 billion) are Biogen Idec, Gilead, Chiron (at the end of 2005 Chiron had agreed to be acquired by Novartis), and Sepracor, and in tier 3 ($1\u20135 billion) are Millennium, Vertex, and Cephalon. It is instructive to note which products of these companies have reached the marketplace, and thus contributed to those companies achieving fully integrated pharmaceutical company (FIPCO) status.",

However, the combination of the major pharmaceutical companies has spawned a whole host of spinout companies, many in the field of drug discovery. In addition, many universities recognize the worth of the IP they generate and create spinout SME companies to maximize it. Drug discovery is such a multidisciplinary task that few SMEs ever become proficient in all disciplines, and the majority of SME companies have become intensely interdependent on each other. Such enforced sharing of objectives and ideals has formed the biotech communities of California, Massachusetts, and Medicon Valley, amongst others, and is being emulated in territories like Singapore. Each localized community has provided a forum for intellectual discussions that lead to innovation. This is now being recognized by big pharma which in some cases is moving its own R&D sites to such geographical clusters.",

As of 2005, big pharma appears to have maintained its traditional preponderance of invention of drugs. Nonetheless, it is likely that biotech will be a significant (if not ultimately the major) source of new drugs to big pharma and ultimately the patient population.
