This includes an outbreak of influenza A (H3N2) virus in a police residential college in Pretoria in 2003 with an attack rate of 20-47% [4], an outbreak affecting students from several schools in Bophuthatswana in 1978 where the strain was not characterized [5], and an outbreak of influenza A (H2N2) virus in gold miners near Johannesburg in 1958 with an attack rate of 15% [6].",

Symptoms among students presenting to the sanatorium included fever, cough and generalised body pains. Due to the high number of cases, the disruption of school activities and the unique opportunity to describe an influenza outbreak in a closed population, we conducted an investigation during the 26-29th of July 2016, aimed to confirm the etiological agent, estimate attack rates among students and identify risk factors for illness.",

We included all 308 senior school boarding students, but excluded day students as they were more likely to seek private healthcare and we did not have the resources or ethical permission to review records from students at all private practitioners in the town. Cases of medILI from 3 July - 1 August 2016 (start of the school term until end of investigation) were defined as boarding students having a cough and fever as noted on records or extrapolated from prescribed medication, and were identified through a retrospective review of medical records and the admission log at the sanatorium. Fever was defined as either a documented body temperature above 38\u00b0C or \u201cfever\u201d noted under symptoms in the medical record. Non-cases were persons who did not meet the medILI case definition. Medical records of 198 patients were reviewed from the senior school boarding population, including all cases of clinician-diagnosed influenza from 3-27 July 2016 (n=82), and a convenience sample of a subset of non-cases (n=116). Age, residence information and influenza vaccination status prior to the outbreak for all boarders were obtained from the school's register. Attack rates were calculated by dividing the number of cases of medILI by the specified population. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to compare the rate of medILI in each subgroup, including all variables that produced a p-value <0.2 in the univariate analysis. Variables considered in the model were age, gender and boarding house. The vaccine effectiveness against medILI in senior boarders was calculated by determining the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of medILI in those vaccinated to those not vaccinated and then using the following formula: VE = (1-aOR) x 100.",

All senior students (boarding and day) were invited to complete a self-administered, web-based questionnaire which collected information on demographics, travel and medical history, current influenza vaccination status, ILI symptoms and participation in academic, sport and cultural activities in the month prior to the investigation. An epidemiological curve was constructed to include the time period before the start of the term to indicate the baseline level of medILI before the outbreak and the medILI that occurred until the end of the outbreak investigation (25 June - 27 July 2016). Attack rates for self-reported medILI (self-reported cough and fever and seeking medical care from a nurse or clinician) were calculated from the start of the school term (3 July 2016) to when the investigation was performed (27 July 2016) by dividing the number of individuals reporting each condition by the specified population. A multivariable logistic regression analysis compared the proportion reporting medILI in each of the subgroups, assessing all variables with a p-value <0.2 in the univariate analysis. Variables with a p-value <0.05 were included in the final analysis. Variables considered in the model were age, grade, gender, nationality, boarding/day student, boarding house, having cubicles in the boarding room, participation in sports and other activities and having underling medical conditions.",

A modelling study by Glass et al. among school-aged children predicted that social interactions with friends, attending school lectures, and participating in sports were some of the most important factors for influenza transmission [21]. This may be the cause for the association of medILI with playing squash. The sport takes place in a confined space leading to participants being in close proximity. Squash is an aerobic sport with associated increases in the heart and respiratory rate. Studies have shown that strenuous exercise can lead to the suppression of the immune system and make individuals more vulnerable to infections, especially of the upper respiratory tract [22,23]. Studies have also shown that individuals may start shedding the virus and become infective up to two days prior to showing symptoms [24].

The influenza strain that circulated during this outbreak may have undergone antigenic drift from the vaccine strain leading to reduced protection, but antigenic data were unavailable. Genome sequencing of the strains did indicate some mutations from the vaccine strain, but these mutations would not necessarily translate to a reduction in vaccine effectiveness.

Prior studies have shown that influenza vaccination programs in boarding schools can reduce the attack rate of ILI by 50% [27]. Since complications due to influenza rarely arise in healthy school-going children [28], reasons to encourage vaccination in this population should focus on reducing the disruption to academic and sports programs by reducing absenteeism [29] and the indirect effect on reducing the community acquisition of the virus by preventing the amplification of transmission in schools [30,31]. To prevent transmission of influenza in schools and other settings, it is recommended that individuals with ILI symptoms not attend work or school until at least 24 hours after fever subsides. Students, parents and staff should be educated on the differences between a common cold and influenza to ensure that health care is sought if they experience ILI. Furthermore, one should avoid close contacts; limit visitors; wash hands with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand rub regularly; and wipe down regularly touched surfaces with a disinfectant. Lastly, it is important to practice good respiratory etiquette by covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing [32]. Schools should have an outbreak management plan in place to be able to detect when the number of cases exceeds the normal seasonal number for early outbreak detection and have a contingency plan in place if this occurs. This plan should include procedures on how and where to isolate symptomatic students, how to record all cases and how to effectively communicate to staff, students and their parents to ensure cooperation and prevent anxiety.",

We employed a broad case definition and an outcome of laboratory-confirmed influenza would have been more specific but reduced the number of cases available for analysis as not all cases were laboratory tested. The higher attack rate observed in the cross-sectional study may be due to the use of self-reported symptoms and not physician indicate symptoms as in the cohort study. The impact of the outbreak might not be completely represented when using the medically attended ILI case definition as described by WHO which relies on the presence of a fever and cough [33]. There were several cases of clinically diagnosed influenza identified through medical record review that did not meet our case definition; mostly due to the absence of a cough. A recent transmission study in Hong Kong showed that 41% of individuals who tested positive for influenza did not present with fever, cough or sore throat, which was the WHO case definition for ILI prior to 2014 [24]. We had a low response rate (36%) in the cross-sectional study. This was influenced by lack of interest among some students and by lack of parental consent for others. This may have resulted in participation bias where students that were not affected by ILI might have been less likely to participate, inflating the attack rate of ILI in the cross-sectional study. The attack rate for medILI in the cohort study may therefore be a more accurate representation of the outbreak.",
