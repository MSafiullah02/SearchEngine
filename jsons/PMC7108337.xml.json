Numerous studies and meta-analyses have confirmed that the use of NIV is associated with reduced risk of treatment failure (relative risk (RR) 0.48), lower intubation rates (RR 0.41) with a lower incidence of nosocomial infections, and a reduction in mortality (RR 0.52) with subsequent reduced length of hospital of stay and costs. These benefits have been shown predominantly in patients with mild to moderate hypercapnic respiratory failure (pH 7.30\u20137.34). NIV should therefore be considered first-line therapy for this group and can be safely used in appropriately staffed and monitored environments outside ICU. However, the use of NIV in patients with more severe respiratory failure1 can still be compatible with favourable outcomes. In such patients, treatment failure is higher, and thus a high-dependency environment should be considered to allow for rapid escalation to intubation and invasive ventilation if appropriate.",

Although some studies report improvements in intubation rate, mortality and length of hospital stay with NIV, this is not universal. Differences may be partly due to marked heterogeneity between the study populations in both cause and severity of respiratory failure, in particular in the frequency of pre-existing COPD, for which benefits are very clear. As such, the routine use of NIV in severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is not recommended outside critical care facilities. Although early studies have shown early NIV initiation to be beneficial in the management of hypoxic respiratory failure in immunocompromised patients, this has not been borne out in a recent large multicentre study (IVNIctus4). Again, we would advocate that this is best undertaken in a high-dependency or intensive care environment with rapid access to invasive ventilation and multiorgan support.",

Most patients will have evidence of developing or established organ dysfunction, particularly cardiovascular dysfunction (ischaemic heart disease, sepsis), and such patients are commonly hypovolaemic. Both anaesthetic induction agents and positive-pressure ventilation (which decreases venous return) produce cardiovascular depression, and peri-intubation hypotension is common. In addition, cessation of spontaneous ventilation can lead to very rapid desaturation in such patients because of their marginal respiratory reserve and circulatory problems. These consequences must be anticipated and require early involvement of an experienced member of the critical care team, ideally in an appropriately equipped area of the hospital.",

Simpler forms of extracorporeal support exist for when hypercapnia is the predominant problem. Studies are ongoing to establish whether such therapies have a role in further mitigating the injurious effects of invasive ventilation in patients with ARDS, avoiding invasive ventilation in patients with COPD failing NIV and weaning patients from longer term mechanical ventilation.
