The military consider disaster and event planning as normal and this strategic organisational role spreads to military medicine and on to civil medicine. As the military roll out field hospital capability across Europe, we face the stark possibility and probability of a different form of medicine with mass decision-making and the reality of harsh resource-based discussions. Triage in Italy during the peak was a clear example of the hard-hitting nature of this pandemic with doctors facing decision that they may only have read about.",

PPE is the example where the evidence from the front line gives a real picture but the policies lag behind and are open to question [2]. Rationing is a feature of medicine that we have learnt to cope with, including rationing of procedures, but we manage this in normal practice taking criticism in our stride as we drive forward with a huge volume of research stimulating knowledge. We drive against the policy-makers tolerating frustrating changes, often with well-meaning science misinterpreted and questioned by funders.",
