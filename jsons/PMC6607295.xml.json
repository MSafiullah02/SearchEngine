The problem of drinking water is very complex and multifaceted, and, therefore, it is relevant for both high\u2010 and low\u2010income countries. This is why access to safe drinking water and sanitation is among the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, i.e., Agenda 2030.1 In low\u2010income countries, when a centralized water supply is not available or the quantity is limited, poor households have to rely on water obtained from rivers, rain, or shallow wells.2 The lack of safe water is a part of a vicious cycle, where poverty and poor healthcare feed each other. Water safety is also an important issue in high\u2010income countries with centralized water supply since water\u2010borne outbreaks continue to occur3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and many more incidents are expected, especially among susceptible population groups, including increasing elderly population above the age of 65, children below the age of 5, chronically ill patients, recipients of immunosuppressive therapies, and pregnant women.11 Globalization of commerce, expansion of food supply sources from regions with unimproved irrigation, people migration from areas with poor hygiene, and natural sporadic mutations contribute to the spread of water\u2010borne diseases.11\n",

            "text": "There are about 140 known water\u2010borne pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, and protozoa. Viruses are the smallest and probably the most difficult to deal with from them all. They have the greatest infectivity among all known water\u2010borne pathogens and high resistivity to disinfection.11 They are further excreted with feces in relatively large quantities (>1011 g\u22121) and generally exhibit longest survival potential in the environment. It is estimated that known viral pathogens account for nearly 8% of water\u2010borne infection outbreaks. It should however be noted that water\u2010borne infections of undetermined etiology, which account for almost half of all documented cases, are probably due to viruses for which currently there are no suitable laboratory host cultures.11 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), moderately to severely infectious water\u2010borne viral pathogens are numerous and include adenovirus, astrovirus, echovirus, hepatitis viruses, rotavirus, caliciviruses (including norovirus), enteroviruses (including coxsackieviruses and polioviruses), polyomaviruses, cytomegalovirus, papillomaviruses, influenza viruses, and coronaviruses.12, 13, 14 Massive virus outbreaks due to poor water quality can occur in any country, including countries with centralized water supply and sustained vigilance.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 Only in the USA, there are estimated 4 million to 33 million cases of acute gastrointestinal illnesses each year due to drinking water.15, 16 Virus clearance is more difficult than that of bacteria, and, therefore, bacteriologically safe water may not be necessarily virally safe.",

Animal farms and sewage discharges in close proximity are well\u2010known sources of contamination for surface water.11 Recently, it is recognized that another potential source of virus contamination, previously considered safe and therefore unmonitored, is groundwater, which is utilized directly by small communities and private homeowners. Several surveys in the USA documented evidence of viruses in ground water,17, 18, 19 which is often associated with proximity of septic systems to water sources due to landfill leaks, improper wastewater disposal, and septic tank contamination.11 It is estimated that about half of the water\u2010borne disease outbreaks in the USA is due to untreated groundwater.19 Also in the European Union (EU), where there are \u224885 000 decentralized small supplies providing drinking water to \u224865 million citizens, almost 40% of them are not properly monitored or do not deliver drinking water complying with microbiological quality standards.20\n",

However, higher doses are normally required to destroy virus as compared to bacteria,21, 22, 23 and chlorination may also lead to toxic by\u2010products (e.g., trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids) as well as residual infectivity depending on the water quality.24 An increased reliance on UV light for water disinfection has raised the concerns for viral resistance, especially related to adenovirus infection,25, 26 which is especially problematic for immunocompromised population, e.g., in cancer and bone marrow transplant patients.11 Chemical coagulation using metal ions, e.g., alum (Al2(SO4)3), salts of iron, lime (Ca(OH)2), and various polyelectrolytes is the second most common method of inactivating viruses from water after disinfection.21, 22, 27, 28, 29 However, research suggests that flocculation does not remove all viruses exhaustively, showing varying results between log10 virus titer reduction of 1 and 2.86.30\n",

The latter difference could potentially be due to compaction of the 29 \u00b5m filter paper at 3 bar as discussed earlier.40 It should be noted that the 9 \u00b5m filter exhibits higher variability of V\nmax values, which is likely to be due to larger spread of initial flux values and extrapolation.",

Compared to other available advanced water treatment membranes, the mille\u2010feuille filter is attractive for point\u2010of\u2010use applications as an affordable, single\u2010use filter paper, similar to coffee filters used in household for brewing. Because traditional water treatment membranes are used over an extended period of time, i.e., 5\u201315 years after installation, they need to be regularly backflashed and treated with chemical disinfectants (hypochlorite) in order to avoid biofilm formation on the surface of the membrane. The biofilm formation is a major issue for the membranes, as it is deteriorating the key processing parameters over time, including flux and permeate quality. In contrast, an affordable single\u2010use filter paper with excessive microorganism removal capacity and high flux eliminates the risk of biofilm formation and thereby the need for regular cleaning and disinfection. Therefore, we suggest that the mille\u2010feuille filter paper is an interesting point\u2010of\u2010use, sustainable alternative to address the global challenges related to drinking water purification.",
