Its origin is in Wuhan, People's Republic of China, with the first cases reported there in December of 2019 and has rapidly spread worldwide since that time. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a world pandemic and to date, over two million people worldwide have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and it will continue to spread throughout the world over the coming months to years. Its health and economic consequences have been profound and have affected nearly all countries across the globe.[1]",

Through close cooperation with our state government and examination of available epidemiological models, IU Health determined that a surge of patients affected by the novel coronavirus would encounter our health system in late March and within an anticipated peak in mid to late April. Our program made the decision to stop all elective, non-urgent hip and knee arthroplasty surgery on 03/17/2020 and based on evolving data that became clear, the ambulatory aspect of patient care also ceased immediately. From a hip and knee arthroplasty perspective, appropriately triaging patients based on the extent of their clinical condition and acuity was paramount.",

Simultaneously, PPE and equipment such as ventilators were moved from our orthopaedic focused hospital to the two larger hospitals in the ISR where COVID patients would be treated predominantly.",

            "text": "Unique to the outpatient surgery environment, the ambulatory surgery center facilities played a significant and vital role in terms of contributing resources to accommodate the surge of COVID-19 patients. IU Health has a unique and collaborative partnership with Surgical Care Affiliates (SCA). The partnership between the two entities encompasses 14 discrete ambulatory surgery centers (ASC) whose operations are run by Indiana University Health with administrative support from SCA. The 14 IUH ASC\u2019s perform approximately 75,000 outpatient surgeries annually and analogous to the main hospitals, the ASCs stopped all elective surgeries on March 17, 2020. Supplies and staff from the ASCs were re-deployed into the hospitals to serve vital roles in the continued healthcare expansion to accept the medially ill patients within the COVID-19 surge. In fact, approximately 85% of extra supplies and equipment needed for the frontline providers in the four ISR hospitals were provided by the ASCs, clearly demonstrating the critical important role that the ASCs played and continue to play in the COVID pandemic response. It is important to recognize the leadership role that ASCs play in the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. SCA is one of many ambulatory surgery center entities in the US who play a vital role in healthcare delivery and were vital in rapidly deploying PPEs, ventilators, supplies, and staff to the various hospitals. In our particular health system, three of the ambulatory surgery centers remained open for urgent ambulatory surgical care. This further supported the healthcare resource conundrum, by performing urgent surgical care for less complex ambulatory procedures in the ASCs which allowed the more medically complex COVID-19 patients to have access to the inpatient hospital system. Some guidelines and publications have been established regarding what constitutes an \u201curgent\u201d procedure within and ASC or outpatient setting.[2] It is generally accepted that an \u201curgent\u201d procedure is a surgery that would increase the risk of permanent impairment or pain if not performed in a timely manner.",

It is probable that every patient regardless of symptoms, will need to be tested for COVID-19 prior to elective surgery within a certain time prior to surgery. This will need to be embedded in the perioperative medical pathways which are typical for hip and knee arthroplasty programs. It is also likely that all the surgical care teams and providers in the ambulatory surgery centers will need to self-monitor and document they are afebrile and do not have any COVID-19 type symptoms at a minimum before caring for the patients for the day and as rapid testing is further developed and accessible, may need to be done on a regular basis to the OR personnel since asymptomatic shed of the virus can occur with some frequency. As testing and clinical information become more available and accurate, it is paramount that patient and health care worker safety is the number one priority. Likely the most important component of successfully and safely performing elective total hip and knee surgery is accurate and accessible preoperative COVID-19 testing.",

            "text": "There is a definite trend in United States over the past few years in performing a greater percentage of total hip and knee arthroplasty patients in the outpatient environment with same day discharge to home. Recent developments include removing total knee arthroplasty off the inpatient only list in 2018, followed by removing total hip arthroplasty off the inpatient only list and allowing total knee arthroplasty to be performed in Medicare beneficiaries in a freestanding ASC January 2020. There have been substantial advantages purported for performing hip and knee arthroplasty in the outpatient setting that have included improved patient satisfaction,[7] less complications and minimizing the impatient hospital burden. It has been further shown that outpatient total knee arthroplasty is feasible in the Medicare population.[8] The latter benefits has the potential to becoming increasingly important in the post- COVID-19 era. From a health care resource perspective, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted our national health care infrastructure in some geographies may not have capacity to handle large numbers of medically ill patients without compromising the ability to provide elective surgical care, such as hip and knee arthroplasty. The ASCs can provide a great benefit to the health care system by expanding their capacity to accept hip and knee arthroplasty patients who meet medical and surgical criteria to safely discharge the same day. This conserves bed capacity for the larger inpatient hospitals to safely accept and treat medically ill patients, like those with respiratory illness from COVID-19. This impact with not only be prevalent in the short term, but will also be lasting as it has become known that COVID-19 will continue in our society for the next few years until larger, broad based immunity is enacted through a vaccine and consistent exposure to the virus by the population. ASC infrastructure will face a challenge in terms of capacity to handle these larger and more complex surgical procedures such as hip and knee arthroplasty. While COVID-19 has accelerated the push for hip and knee arthroplasty within the outpatient setting, ASC\u2019s have been addressing the facility limitations over the past few years due to external forces lead by the government and CMS (Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services). Now that Medicare beneficiaries able to undergo knee arthroplasty in freestanding ASCs, these facilities have been attempting to address their subsequent shortcomings that include limited capacity in terms of available square footage, inadequate central sterile processing capacity for larger numbers of trays and in some cases, lack of qualified staff who are capable of caring for hip and knee arthroplasty patients. Compared to the traditional smaller surgeries performed in ASCs, total hip and knee arthroplasty can be associated with more blood loss, more soft tissue trauma and unique perioperative issues in the first few hours after surgery that may challenge the ASC staff. However, with proper training, experience and mentoring from others with experience discharging hip and knee arthroplasty patients the same day of surgery, the ASC staff can become proficient and capable in caring for these patients.",

While traditionally only about half of patients were aware that outpatient total joint arthroplasty was an option as reported in one recent study,[9] the increased patient demand in the post-COVID-19 era will be primarily driven by the lingering fear by patients and their families that hospitals are the primary societal location of the highly contagious and potentially lethal SARS-CoV-2 virus. This fear has spawned from the data (and excessive media coverage) demonstrating this particular virus is highly contagious and can affect even well-protected health care workers and can be spread in a high percentage of asymptomatic individuals and in some cases, can prove fatal by mechanisms not currently understood.",
