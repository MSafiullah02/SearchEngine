However, randomised clinical trials for both therapies have since failed to show benefit.2, 3 Why, then, did so many more Americans survive if not due to preferential access to experimental therapies? The likely answer is the Americans survived not due to preferential access to unproven therapies but to proven ones.",

It has been argued that COVID-19 causes a form of ARDS which is different from what is claimed to be traditional or typical ARDS and therefore should be treated differently. The evidence supporting these claims is poor or absent. For example, a common refrain is that patients with ARDS from COVID-19 have higher lung compliance and worse oxygenation than traditional ARDS. However, published compliance data from patients with ARDS from COVID-19 are largely consistent with data from ARDS trials predating the pandemic. Furthermore, the few published and preprint tissue analyses available from both biopsy and autopsy specimens show diffuse alveolar damage as is typically seen in ARDS from other causes. Similarly, while much attention has been paid to the presence of extensive pulmonary microthrombosis in patients with ARDS from COVID-19, the same observation was made in ARDS more than 30 years ago.",

By definition ARDS is a syndrome, not a disease. While disentangling subtypes of ARDS is an active and promising field, the bulk of clinical trial data to date come from patients with ARDS of varying causes, including viral pneumonias. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, proven therapies for ARDS (low tidal volume ventilation, prone positioning, and conservative fluid strategy) should remain the standard of care for all patients with ARDS, including patients with COVID-19.",
