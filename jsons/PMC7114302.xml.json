SARS-CoV presented with high virulence and mortality, and affected 30 countries, with more than 8000 cases and over 750 deaths. Indeed, as the clinical symptoms of SARS are non-specific compared to those of other respiratory viruses, diagnosis relies largely on laboratory tests (Ksiazek et al., 2003). Thus, the development of diagnostic laboratory tests for specific and early detection of SARS-CoV infection is of great importance for both rapid treatment of patients and control of SARS outbreaks.",

RT-PCR and real time-PCR for direct detection of SARS-CoV RNA is expensive and labor-intensive, relies on the availability of expertise, and may produce false-positive results due to contamination (Keightley et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2005a, Huang et al., 2005b). Serological methods, such as immunofluorescence assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), are not adequate for the early diagnosis of SARS, because the median time to seroconversion in SARS patients is 17\u201320 days after the onset of symptoms (Wu et al., 2004a, Wu et al., 2004b). Therefore, the generation of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against SARS-CoV antigens may provide possible diagnostic tools for early diagnosis of SARS, because SARS-CoV can be specifically detected in the respiratory specimens, blood and stool much earlier than antibodies can be used for detection (Lau et al., 2004, Di et al., 2005).",

Thus, this protein may have important roles in the pathogenesis of SARS. Furthermore, this protein is the most abundantly expressed structural protein during infection and is highly detectable in SARS patients (Rota et al., 2003, Lau et al., 2004, Di et al., 2005). Therefore, this protein may serve as one of the immunodominant antigens in the early diagnosis of infection. Furthermore, some researchers have suggested that antibody against the N protein could modulate cytokine responses such as IL 11; non-neutralizing antibodies against N protein were found to protect mice against lethal infection (Nakanaga et al., 1986, Cheng et al., 2005). Therefore, the development of mAbs against SARS-N protein may be critical in the development of drugs to treat SARS-CoV infection, and for further study of the pathogenesis of SARS, as well as early diagnosis.",

The anti-His tag antibody served as a positive control that was capable of recognizing the N-terminal 6\u00d7 His tag of BrSARS-N protein. As demonstrated in Fig. 1\n, all SARS-N mAbs and anti-His tag antibody reacted with 48- and 46-kDa isoforms of SARS-N protein. Additionally, anti-His tag antibody and three IgG2b mAbs (22-05-03, 07-19-11 and 07-19-21) bound with a protein of approximately 22-kDa, whereas two IgG1 mAbs (21-10-06 and 21-10-11) recognized a fragment of about 25 kDa. The isoforms of 48, 46 and 22-kDa could be originally obtained by purification of BrSARS-N protein extracted from baculovirus-infected cells. These isoforms were also observed in immunoblot analysis of total proteins extracted from baculovirus-infected cells and SARS-CoV-infected cells (data not shown). Thus, these isoforms may be fragment cleaved by intracellular protease. The fragment of 25-kDa that was not observed in originally purified BrSARS-N protein could be obtained by freezing and thawing procedures of purified protein. Thus, this result indicated that the epitopes of all of the SARS-N mAbs are linear, and the epitopes of IgG2b and IgG1 mAbs are located in the N-terminus and C-terminus of SARS-N protein, respectively. To more precisely analyze the epitope of SARS-N protein recognized by these SARS-N mAbs, competitive ELISA was conducted using the 19 synthetic peptides covering the full-length SARS-N protein sequence. Among these synthetic peptides, the N135 peptide (ATEGALNTPKDHIGTR; at position 135-150 of SARS-N protein) and N17 peptide (TFGGPTDSTDNNQNGG; at position 17-32) could effectively compete in the binding of all of the IgG2b mAbs with the SARS-N protein, and the N117 peptide (GPEASLPYGANKEGIV; at position 117-132) seems to have slightly weak activity, while the other peptides did not exhibit any effect in this assay (Fig. 2A). The N17 and N135 peptides contain no apparent common epitopes, which revealed that these mAbs are mixed antibodies. The N215 peptide (GGETALALLLLDRLNQLESKVSGKG; at position 215-239) resulted in complete inhibition of the binding activity of all of the IgG1 mAbs with the SARS-N protein, and the N245 peptide (QTVTKKSAAEASKKPRQKRTATKQ; at position 245-268) seems to have slightly weak activity (Fig. 2B). According to the results of the immunoblot and competitive ELISA, the epitopes of the IgG2b mAbs is located in the N-terminal region at aa 17\u201332 and 117\u2013150, whereas that of the IgG1 mAbs is located in the middle region at aa 215\u2013268 (Fig. 2C).",

Therefore, there is an intense need for the development of sensitive and specific detection methods for SARS-CoV infection. Many methods have been employed recently for the detection of SARS-CoV infection (Keyaerts et al., 2005, Yamashita et al., 2005, Keightley et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2005a, Huang et al., 2005b). Of these diagnostic methods, RT-PCR and real time-PCR have been the most widely used. However, these methods possess some general problems, as they are time-consuming and labor-intensive, require sophisticated instruments, and have high rates of false positivity. On the other hand, laboratory methods detecting viral antigen by mAbs, including antigen-capture ELISA, provide more rapid, less labor-intensive, and more convenient alternatives (Lau et al., 2004, Di et al., 2005). In this study, we generated five positive clones secreting specific and highly reactive antibodies against SARS-CoV N protein in order to develop diagnostic methods. These mAbs were available for use in detecting SARS-CoV N protein by various diagnostic methods, such as immunoblot assay, immunofluorescence assay and antigen-capture ELISA (Table 3\n). We also revealed the availability of these mAbs in the quantification of SARS-N protein by antigen-capture ELISA. The detection limit of this test is 100 pg of recombinant protein and 10 TCID50 of SARS-CoV. This sensitivity is consistent with previous studies of sensitivity in other antigen-capture ELISAs (Che et al., 2004, Di et al., 2005). Therefore, these five mAbs may be employed in the construction of various diagnostic methods for the detection of SARS-CoV and in quantitative analysis of viral antigen and virus titer.",

However, recent reports have demonstrated that, because the S protein is expressed at very low levels in vivo and in cultured cells (Zeng et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2004a, Wu et al., 2004b), it is difficult to directly detect the soluble S protein from SARS patients. Thus, the S protein may not be suitable for use as a practical diagnostic antigen. In contrast, the N protein can be detected at significant levels in patient serum, as well as in respiratory tract samples at early stages of SARS-CoV infection (Lau et al., 2004, Di et al., 2005). These previous reports support that the development of mAbs against SARS-N protein is an adequate approach for the diagnosis of SARS. Therefore, we generated mAbs directed against SARS-CoV N protein and demonstrated that these SARS-N mAbs can successfully detect the N protein in SARS-CoV-infected cells; this is very useful in diagnosing SARS patients.",

Therefore, the mAbs available for developing sensitive diagnostic methods have to recognize the non-phosphorylated protein as well as phosphorylated protein. A previous report suggested that, because of conformational differences between proteins, the mAbs recognizing a protein expressed in insect cells cannot recognize the protein of same cDNA constructs expressed in E. coli (Vapalahti et al., 1996). Therefore, the SARS-N mAbs obtained in the present study were generated using recombinant SARS-N protein expressed in insect cells; these mAbs may not recognize the N protein expressed in E. coli. However, all of the SARS-N mAbs reacted significantly with the ErSARS-N expressed in E. coli, as well as the phosphorylated form of the BrSARS-N protein. These results demonstrate that these mAbs can effectively detect the non-phosphorylated N protein that exists in host cells during viral replication, as well as the phosphorylated N protein in host cells and viral particles. All of these mAbs could successfully detect native-form N protein in infected cells, as well as in viral particles. Thus, these mAbs may be useful in the development of sensitive methods used for the diagnosis of SARS.",

The others were newly identified at the N-terminus, which is shared with an RNA binding domain (aa 17\u201332 and 135\u2013150; IgG2b subclass mAbs) that is the minor B cell epitope (He et al., 2004). Furthermore, all of these SARS-N mAbs were reactive in immunoblotting, which suggests that they recognized linear epitopes in the N protein. A recent report demonstrates that the N protein is easily degraded into various isoforms in the lysates of SARS-CoV-infected cells (Zeng et al., 2004). We can also suggest, as previously described, that various isoforms existed in SARS-N protein expressed in insect cells and could be detected by immunoblot assay using these mAbs. Therefore, the blend of two mAbs against the different epitopes can be used to detect various fragments from SARS-N protein and enhance the sensitivity of diagnostic tools.",

Hence, anti-sera against SARS-CoV may be cross-reactive with other HCoVs. However, previous reports support the idea that the SARS-N mAbs did not recognize the N proteins of other HCoVs (Che et al., 2004). Therefore, the issues of cross-reactivity during the detection of SARS-N protein with polyclonal anti-sera can potentially be overcome by the use of a specific mAb against SARS-CoV. In the present study, the SARS-N mAbs did not show cross-reactivity with N proteins of HCoV, as determined by immunofluorescence assay and antigen-capture ELISA.

Thus, SARS-N protein in its soluble form may play an important role in extracellular pathogenesis of SARS. However, it is totally unclear which of the intracellular and extracellular mechanisms are involved in viral replication and pathogenesis, and how the intracellular mechanisms are regulated by the N protein.
