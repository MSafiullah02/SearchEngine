We further devised computational models that accurately predict 21 frameshifting potential (up to auROC=0.93) and frameshifting rates (up to Pearson r=0.81) of novel 22 variants, including subtle differences between HIV clinical isolates (r=0.60). Taken together, this 23 systematic approach can contribute to the development of antiviral agents acting on programmed 24 ribosomal frameshifting. 25 26 Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF), i.e. controlled slippage of the ribosome, is a mechanism 27 by which two proteins with alternative C termini can be generated from the same mRNA. It allows for 28 an expansion of the proteome but also constitutes an additional regulatory layer to fine-tune gene 29 expression (Advani and Dinman, 2016; Dinman, 2012; Ketteler, 2012) . This mechanism is widespread 30 and indispensable in viruses, which often utilize controlled slippage of the ribosome to an alternative 31 frame to regulate the production of key enzymes, such as in the case of the gag-pol frameshift in HIV 32 and other retroviruses. Utilizing alternative frames increases the amount of genetic information that 33",

When taking into account regions of e.g. 60 nt after the slippery site (\"dg60\"), a lower feature 470 value favored prediction of PRF (Fig S11B) .).

The quantitative 596 nature of our assay allows us nevertheless to accurately quantify the effect of sequence variation 597 away from the slippery site, revealing sub-type specific differences. Furthermore, we devised a 598 machine learning model that is able to predict the natural variation in HIV frameshifting rates for novel 599 variants (Pearson r=0.60).

We then created for each PRF event two sets of ten sequences each (using antaRNA) that 672 are predicted to fold into the downstream secondary structure as determined using ViennaRNA and 673 pKiss, respectively. Furthermore we designed variants of the predicted HIV, SRV1 and nsp2F 674 (PRRSV) downstream secondary structure, e.g. by extending or reducing the length of hairpins, and 675 completely synthetic secondary structures and again used antaRNA to create sets of corresponding 676 sequences that we used to replace the native downstream structure in all 15 PRF events.

As we do not find evidence for an effect of MFE on overall RNA levels (Fig S7, 363S8, S9; e.g. through triggering No-Go decay(Belew et al., 2011)), we suggest that this reflects a 364 strong preference for downstream secondary structure rigidity to be close to that of the wild-type 365 sequence (in particular for SARS, SRV1 and HERV-K10,Fig S7, S8, right panels). Although present 366 secondary structure prediction algorithms might not be sufficiently accurate for this task, especially in 367 the case of pseudoknots, our results support a view according to which not only the structure, but also 368 the sequence downstream of a slippery site is critical for triggering frameshifting.369 370 Additional regulatory elements contribute to PRF 371 The distance between the slippery site and the downstream secondary structure has been shown to 372 be important for efficient frameshifting (Brierley et al., 1989; Kollmus et al., 1994; Lin et al., 2012), 373 probably to position the paused ribosome at the slippery site (Brierley and Pennell, 2001). To test 374whether this is generally true or if there are PRF event-specific differences, we introduced between 375 one and nine nucleotides from different constant sequences or deleted between one and six, mutating 376 downstream stop codons as required(Fig 4A top). Most insertions or deletions led to substantially 377 reduced frameshifting signal(Fig 4B), no matter what the context and if the original downstream 378 coding frame was preserved or not, suggesting that the exact position of the downstream regulatory 379 elements is important across PRF events. This is in contrast to an earlier study reporting unchanged 380 or even dramatically increased -1 frameshifting efficiency at the HIV site upon reducing spacer 381 lengths, which the authors attribute to a change in local secondary structure triggered by the specific 382 deletion introduced in their construct(Mouzakis et al., 2013). Overall, our results are in line with the 383 regulatory elements being in optimal distance from one another and the downstream secondary 384 structure creating a roadblock that causes the ribosome to pause exactly at the slippery site(Brierley  385    and Pennell, 2001;Tu et al., 1992). 386",

Our results corroborate the functional link between minimum 550 free energy of downstream structures and show that this is true for most PRF events tested. However, 551 this correlation generally depended on the length of the downstream region taken into account, in 552 agreement with the specific association between PRF efficiency and thermodynamic stability of the 553 start of the HIV stem loop structure reported earlier (Mouzakis et al., 2013). Furthermore, the 554 correlation between PRF signal and MFE only held true when testing small variations of the native 555 sequence and structure; when sequences and structures different from the native one were tested, 556 this correlation was lost. 557 Slippery site and a downstream stimulatory signal are central -and therefore intensely studied -558 regulatory elements present in all known PRF events. Here, we expanded the repertoire of regulatory 559 inputs and demonstrated that both tRNA availability as well as amino acid properties can affect PRF 560 efficiencies across native sequence contexts. 561 Ribosome stalling due to limited tRNA availability has the potential to lead to slippage of the ribosome 562 (Gallant and Lindsley, 1992; Weiss et al., 1988) and contributes to non-programmed frameshifting in 563 huntingtin (Girstmair et al., 2013). Availability of tRNAs decoding slippery site codons have been 564 shown to influence HIV gag-pol frameshifting efficiency (Korniy et al., 2019) and HIV-1 itself has the 565 ability to modulate the tRNA pool of the host cell (van Weringh et al., 2011). Our observation that 566 limited tRNA availability in the codons leading up to the slippery site progressively contributes to PRF 567 efficiency is in line with these data and expands the notion of an influence of the tRNA pool on 568 frameshifting beyond the slippery site codons and individual PRF events. 569",

In addition to deciphering the effect of cis-606 regulatory elements, regulation by trans-acting factors like the recently discovered case of the 607 frameshift repressor shiftless (Wang et al., 2019) constitutes another area where a systematic 608 approach like the one presented here can yield novel insights into the mode of action and its 609 specificity. Libraries of frameshifting reporters provide a platform for screening putative modifiers of 610 ribosomal frameshifting, offering a powerful tool to identify ways to generally or selectively control 611 frameshifting and opening new possibilities for interfering with viral replication and for controlling 612 cellular processes depending on translational frameshifting. 613 Methods cloning were excluded from the design. All the variants were composed of an 18 nt forward primer, 620 12 nt barcode sequence, 162 nt variable region and 18 nt reverse primer sequences. DNA barcodes 621 were designed to differ from any other barcode in the library in at least 3 nt. 622 623 Selection of frameshifting sites for systematic sequence manipulations 624 60 PRF events reported previously or listed in FSDB (Moon et al., 2007) were included in the library 625 design. Sequences were aligned in a way that the site of frameshifting would be at the same position 626 in all variants (slippery site ending at position 42). In case there were stop codons downstream of the 627 PRF site in any of the three frames, additional versions with stop codons mutated (changed to TGG) 628 were included for testing only. Out of these, 15 were selected for systematic sequence manipulations 629 based on the amount of experimental evidence supporting them, lack of stop codons in the relevant 630 reading frames, biological significance and mechanistic diversity (i.e. covering +1, -1 and -2 631 frameshifting sites). The HIV and OAZ frameshifting sites were tested beforehand in isolation to 632 confirm that our experimental setup is able to reproduce well established cases of -1 as well as +1 633 PRF. 634 635 Design of individual rationally designed subsets 636 For each of the subsets in the libraries, systematic sequence manipulations were performed on the 637 set of 15 previously reported frameshifting sites. Design of subsets was carried out in Python. 638 Multiple barcode controls: We added multiple variants to the library that contained the same variable 639 region, but different barcodes, in order to gauge potential effects of the barcode and the technical 640 noise of our assay. 641 Slippery site: We tested all possible variations of the different slippery site patterns found in previously 642 reported frameshifting events (XXXYYYZ, XYYZZZZ, influenza, OAZ (for +1 PRF)). In the case of 643 OAZ, both the first and the second codon in the slippery site UCC UGA were replaced with all other 644 codons. In addition, we created all possible point mutations in -1 PRF slippery sites that would not 645 give rise to a stop codon. 646 downstream of PRF slippery sites that would not give rise to a stop codon. In addition, we removed 648 up to 6 bps immediately downstream (in 1 or 3 bp increments, depending on the presence of stop 649 codons in downstream reading frames) or introduced up to 12 bps from five different constant 650 sequences (in 1 or 3 bp increments, depending on the presence of stop codons in downstream 651 reading frames). 652 Immediate upstream region: The first two codons preceding the slippery site (in the original frame) 653 were replaced with all other codons (except stop codons). 654 Upstream region: The upstream region (excluding the last two codons before the slippery site) was 655 randomly recoded five times. Moreover, variants were added for all 15 PRF events in which the same 656 part of the upstream region was replaced by four different constant sequences in increments of six 657 bps, starting from the beginning of the variable region. In addition, we included the following structural 658 variations in the design: We designed sequences 30 nt in length predicted (using ViennaRNA 2.0 659 (Lorenz et al., 2011) and antaRNA (Kleinkauf et al., 2015a, 2015b)) to fold into the respective native 660 structure (but having a different primary sequence or to have no secondary structure, a 9 bp long 661 stem-loop at the 5' or at the 3' end (6 sequences per set) and replaced the endogenous region in all 662 15 PRF events. 663 Downstream region: Variants were added for all 15 PRF events in which the same part of the 664 downstream region was replaced by three different constant sequences (different sets were used for 665 predicted +1 and -1 PRF sites to avoid stop codons in the relevant frames) in increments of six bps, 666 starting from the end of the variable region. For scanning mutagenesis, 30 positions (leaving the first 6676 bp after the slippery site unchanged) were replaced with either A or C (G and T were avoided as 668 they often give rise to stop codons in one of the frames).

Ligated DNA was transformed into E. coli 10G 746 electrocompetent cells (Lucigen) divided into aliquots (23 \u00b5l each, plus 2 \u03bcl of the ligation mix), which 747 were then plated on 4 Luria broth (LB) agar (200 mg/ml amp) 15-cm plates per transformation reaction 748 performed colony PCR (at least 48 random colonies per library). 754 755 Transfection into K562 cells and genomic integration 756 The purified plasmid libraries were transfected into K562 cells and genomically integrated using the 757 Zinc Finger Nuclease (ZFN) system for site-specific integration and the CompoZr\u00ae Targeted 758 Integration Kit -AAVS1 (SIGMA). Transfections were carried out using Amaxa\u00ae Cell Line 759 Nucleofector\u00ae Kit V (LONZA). To ensure library representation we performed 15 nucleofections of 760 the purified plasmid library for each rationally designed library (frame -1 and frame +1) and 5 for each 761 native library. For each nucleofection, 4\u00d710 6 cells were centrifuged and washed twice with 20 ml of 762 Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, SIGMA). Cells were resuspended in 100 \u03bcl solution (warmed 763 to room temperature) composed of 82 \u03bcl solution V and 19 \u03bcl supplement (Amaxa\u00ae Cell Line 764 Nucleofector\u00ae Kit V). Next, the cells were mixed with 2.75 \u03bcg of donor plasmid and 0.6 \u03bcg ZFN mRNA 765 (prepared in-house) just prior to transfection. Nucleofection was carried out using program T-16 on 766 the NucleofectorTM device, immediately mixed with ~0.5 ml of pre-cultured growth medium and 767 transferred to a 6 well plate with additional 1.5 ml of pre-cultured growth medium. A purified plasmid 768 library was also transfected without the addition of ZFN and served as a control to determine when 769 cells lost non-integrated plasmids. 770 771 Sorting the library by FACS 772 K562 cells were grown for at least 14 days to ensure that non-integrated plasmid DNA was eliminated. 773 A day prior to sorting, cells were split to ~0.25\u00d7106 cells/ml. On the day of sorting, cells were 774 centrifuged, resuspended in sterile PBS and filtered using cell-strainer capped tubes (Becton 775 Dickinson (BD) Falcon). Sorting was performed with BD FACSAria II SORP (special-order research 776 product) at low sample flow rate and a sorting speed of ~18000 cells/s. To sort cells that integrated 777 the reporter construct successfully and in a single copy (~4% of the population), we determined a 778 gate according to mCherry fluorescence so that only mCherry-expressing cells corresponding to a 779 single copy of the construct were sorted (mCherry single population). We collected around 350 780 cells/variant on average for each library in order to ensure adequate library representation. 781 population (combined rationally designed and native library, but separately for -1 PRF reporters, +1 783 PRF reporters and the stop-vector control) into 16 (in the case of the stop-vector 12) bins according 784 to GFP fluorescence, after gating for a narrow range of mCherry expression to avoid effects coming 785 from the influence of the variable region on overall expression level. This resulted in the loss of a 786 significant fraction of variants (as only around 50% of the cells fell into the narrow range of mCherry 787 fluorescence) but ensured that the subsequent sorting by GFP fluorescence was not biased by 788 expression level. Each bin was defined to span a range of GFP fluorescence values such that it 789 contains between 1-10% of the cell population. We collected around 1000 cells/variant on average in 790 order to ensure adequate library representation. Cells from each bin were grown separately for 791 freezing and purification of genomic DNA. 792 793 Genomic DNA purification, amplification and sample preparation 794 For each of the bins we purified genomic DNA by centrifuging 5\u00d710 6 cells, washing them with 1 ml 795 PBS and purifying DNA using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's 796 protocol. In order to maintain the complexity of the library amplified from gDNA, PCR reactions were 797 carried out on a gDNA amount calculated to contain a minimum average of 200 copies of each oligo 798 included in the sample. For each of the 16 bins, we used 15 \u00b5g of gDNA as template in a two-step 799 nested PCR. In the first step, three reactions were performed and each reaction contained 5 \u03bcg gDNA, 800 25 \u03bcl Kapa Hifi ready mix X2 (KAPA Biosystems), 2.5 \u03bcl 10 \u03bcM 5\u2032 primer, and 2.5 \u03bcl of 10 \u03bcM 3\u2032 primer. 801",
