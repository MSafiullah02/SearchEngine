It is possible that we are facing a \"proteiform\" disease (from Proteus, the sea god who could change shape to avoid capture). As other coronavirusinduced infections, it initially affects the upper airways, but can move abruptly to the lower respiratory tract. Lastly, while physicians treat the bilateral lung pneumonia of their patients, systemic complications can appear characterized by thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation and multi-organ failure.",

Both of them induce, among other problems, chronic stress on endothelial cells that in turn can express molecules on their plasma membranes abnormally as an effect of post-translational modifications of intracellular proteins, including some heat shock proteins. This condition can predispose cells and tissues to molecular mimicry phenomena that may occur during an infection (Cappello et al. 2009; Delunardo et al. 2013; Kotlarz et al. 2013; Mayr et al. 1999; Sun et al. 2006 ).",
