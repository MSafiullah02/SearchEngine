            "text": "Three experiments were conducted with turkeys to determine the influence of delayed access to feed and water on the development of the digestive system. In all experiments, poults were randomly assigned to three placement times, 6, 30, and 54 h posthatch. Experiments 1, 2, and 3 were terminated when poults were 10, 28, and 14 d old, respectively. In Experiment 1, six poults per treatment were sampled on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10. In Experiment 2, 12 poults per treatment were sampled on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, and 28. The objective of Experiment 3 was to determine the effect of delayed placement on dietary ME n . Delaying access to feed and water for 54 h adversely affected BW through 10, 28, and 14 d of age in Experiments 1, 2, and 3, respectively (P \u00a3 0.01). Delayed access to feed and water for 54 h decreased the absolute weights of the small intestine and pancreas and reduced lengths of the small intestine through 5 d posthatch (P \u00a3 0.05). The relative weights of the small intestine and proventriculus were reduced by delayed access to nourishment through 4 d posthatch. Poults placed on feed at 54 h posthatch had decreased pancreatic amylase activity (P \u00a3 0.05) at 3 and 4 d, and trypsin activities were depressed at 3 d posthatch (P \u00a3 0.05). In Experiment 3, dietary ME n value determined at 4 d of age with poults placed 54 h posthatch was less (P \u00a3 0.07) than the ME n value obtained with poults placed at 6 h posthatch. A 54-h delay in access to feed and water generally delayed development of the digestive system, impaired nutrient utilization, and reduced BW.",

            "text": "Before and immediately after hatch, turkey poults are dependent on the lipids and proteins of the egg yolk as main sources of nutrients. The yolk is usually depleted within 5 to 6 d posthatch . Thus, progress in the physical and functional development of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is necessary to enable newly hatched poults to efficiently utilize nutrients supplied by the diet. Because of distances of shipment or delays in shipment, poults are often subjected to delayed access to feed and water, which may retard the development of the GIT, limiting nutrient utilization and performance of the turkey. Early access to feed and water after hatch has been shown to be an important factor for subsequent performance (Moran, 1990) . Poults deprived of feed and water for 48 h lost 10.7% of their initial posthatch weight . Moran (1978) reported that depriving poults of feed and water for 24 h posthatch led to reduced BW through 14 wk of age. Uni et al. (1998) reported that withholding feed from chicks for 36 h posthatch resulted initially in retarded growth of all segments of the small intestine. Murakami et al. (1992) found that delaying access to feed and water slowed the growth of the small intestine and proventriculus in broiler chicks. Donaldson and Christensen (1991) reported that poults deprived of feed 24 h posthatch had significantly lighter liver weights than fed poults. Noy and Sklan (1997) concluded that one effect of delayed placement on both chicks and poults was that the organs of the GIT (crop, small intestine, and large intestine) grew less by 48 h posthatch than did organs of poults or chicks placed immediately on feed and water. Depriving poults of feed for 48 h posthatch led to reduced uptake of residual yolk and greater yolk weights than was observed with poults given immediate access to feed and water (Moran and Reinhart, 1980; Moran, 1989; Pinchasov and Noy, 1993) . Murakami et al. (1992) reported yolk weight decreases of 48 and 41%/d for fed and feed-deprived broiler chicks, respectively. Research has shown that the digestibility of nutrients in young poultry increases with age. Experimentally determined ME n values of diets fed to poults were lowest between 4 and 7 d of age (Sell, 1996) . Weights of the GIT increase more rapidly than BW in young turkeys until 6 d of age. Total activities of pancreatic enzymes increase substantially after hatching, mainly because of increased pancreas weight . Absorption of nutrients from the GIT is dependent on digestion, mainly by pancreatic enzyme activity. Lack of pancreatic enzymic hydrolysis in the intestinal lumen decreases the apparent digestibility of dietary components (Corring and Bourdon, 1977) . Siddons (1972) reported that by 16 d of age, chickens deprived of feed for 72 h posthatch had lower total activities of all disaccharidases (maltase, sucrase, isomaltase, and palatinase) in the small intestine than chickens deprived of feed for 24 h posthatch. The ability of young poultry to utilize certain dietary fats is especially limited for the first few days after hatch, possibly due to limited pancreatic lipase activity (Krogdahl and Sell, 1989) . The production and secretion of digestive enzymes in the posthatch chick could be limiting factors in digestion and subsequently in feed intake and growth (Nitsan et al., 1991) .",

Moreover, limited research has been done to determine the effects of delaying access to feed and water on the development of the GIT of poults. On the basis of previous research, it was hypothesized that delayed access to feed and water would retard development of the GIT, impairing nutrient utilization and resulting in reduced growth. The three experiments reported herein were conducted to assess the effects of delaying access to feed and water for 6, 30, or 54 h posthatch. Two experiments examined the changes in the GIT, digestive enzymes, and BW, and the third experiment evaluated the changes in utilization of dietary energy.",

Poults of the delayed placement groups (30 and 54 h) were held in shipping boxes until given access to feed and water. At the appropriate times, poults were placed in floor pens (1.2 m 2 ) equipped for brooding (Experiments 1 and 2) or in electrically heated brooder batteries 4 (Experiment 3). After placement, poults were provided feed and water for ad libitum consumption. All poults were fed a cornsoybean meal diet formulated to meet or exceed nutrient concentrations recommended by the NRC (1994) ( Table 1) . The diet fed in Experiments 2 and 3 contained Celite 5 (acid insoluble ash) as an indigestible marker. Experiment 1.

The small intestine with the pancreas was suspended vertically with a weight of 3.5 or 10 g (varying with age) attached to the lower end to apply uniform tension for length measurements. For length and weight measurements, the small intestine was divided into three segments: duodenum (from gizzard to entry of the bile and pancreatic ducts), jejunum (from entry of the ducts to yolk stalk), and ileum (from yolk stalk to ileocecal junction). The pancreas was removed from the duodenal loop, placed in preweighed vials, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The duodenum and ileum were flushed with 10 to 20 mL of deionized water, and the empty weight recorded.

After preliminary drying, feed and excreta samples were ground to pass through a 0.5-mm mesh sieve. Dry matter of the feed and excreta was determined by drying the samples in a forceddraft oven at 72 C for 48 h (AOAC, 1980:Section 7.003). The gross energy of feed and excreta were determined using an adiabatic bomb calorimeter. 8 Feed and excreta were analyzed for nitrogen concentration by the macroKjeldahl method; AOAC, 1980:Section 2.057). Nitrogen concentration was multiplied by 6.25 to calculate the protein percentage (AOAC, 1980:Section 14.068). The concentration of acid insoluble ash in the feed and excreta was determined by the method described by Vogtmann et al. (1975) .

However, because of lack of pen replication, statistical evaluation of these data could not be done. In Experiments 2 and 3, delayed access to feed and water for 30 or 54 h posthatch generally decreased feed intake (Table 3) . This effect was most evident in the instance of cumulative 28-d feed consumption in Experiment 2. Noy and Pinchasov (1993) reported that broiler chicks denied access to feed and water for 24 h posthatch consumed less feed through 40 d of age. This result corresponds to those reported here with turkeys, in that a delay in access to feed and water decreased feed consumption. There were no significant effects (P > 0.05) of delayed access to feed and water on cumulative feed efficiency, which agrees with findings of Noy and Pinchasov (1993) . In contrast, Moran (1978) previously reported improved feed to gain ratios between 2 and 6 wk of age when poults were denied feed for 24 h posthatch. Moran (1978) reported 50% greater mortality when poults were deprived of feed for 24 h after hatch compared with fed poults. Chilson and Patrick (1946) also reported greater mortality rates of poults as the delay in access to nourishment increased. In the current study, mortality of poults placed on feed and water at 30 or 54 h posthatch did not differ from that of poults placed on feed and water at 6 h posthatch.",

In Experiment 1, a 30-h delay in access to feed and water after hatch resulted in reduced lengths of the duodenum at 5 d of age and the jejunum at 2 d of age. In Experiment 2, a 30-h delay reduced the length of the duodenal and ileal at 3 d of age and reduced jejunal lengths between 1 and 3 d of age. Poults placed at 54 h posthatch had shorter small intestines between 2 and 5 d of age and at 10 d of age. Comparing the weight to length ratio (density, grams per centimeter) of the small intestines allows for indirect observation of increases in mucosal mass in the intestine. Lower intestinal density may represent decreased villus height and diameter, which would reduce the digestive and absorptive abilities of the intestines (Uni et al., 1998) . The effects of delayed placement on the intestinal density of poults varied in each segment of the small intestine. Duodenal density was lower at 1 d of age for both delayed placement groups, continuing through 5 d of age for the 54-h placement group. In the jejunum, placement at 30 h posthatch decreased the density at 5 d and 4 d of age in Experiment 1 and 2, respectively, whereas a 54-h delay resulted in lower densities at 2 and 4 d of age in Experiment 1 and 4 and 5 d of age in Experiment 2. Ileal density was lower at 1 d of age due to a 30-and 54-h delay in Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, a reduction in ileal density due to a 30-h delay was observed at 2 d of age, whereas a 54-h delay reduced ileal density between 2 and 4 d of age compared with poults placed at 6 h posthatch.

Heavier absolute yolk weights were observed at 5 and 4 d of age in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively, due to delayed placement. In Experiment 2, relative yolk weight (grams yolk per 100 g BW) was greater between 2 and 4 d of age in poults deprived of feed and water 54 h posthatch than in poults placed on feed and water at 6 h posthatch (Table 8 ). These observations suggest that poults may have the ability for selective rate of nutrient withdrawal from the yolk when fasted or, as Noy and Sklan (1997) concluded, the effect of feed intake on yolk utilization may be attributed to enhanced transport of yolk to the GIT due to increased intestinal motility and activity after feed and water are ingested. Phelps et al. (1987a) noted that the pancreas is the fastest growing organ in poults during the first 10 d after hatch. Delaying access to feed and water adversely affected the absolute pancreas weight in Experiments 1 and 2 (Tables 7  and 8) , whereby a 30-h placement time resulted in reduced absolute and relative weights of the pancreas at 2 d of age. A 54-h placement time depressed pancreas weight between 2 and 4 d of age. In contrast, Pinchasov and Noy (1993) found no difference in relative pancreas weight due to a 24-or 48-h delay in placement time. Because digestive enzyme activity in the pancreas is highly correlated to pancreas weight, changes in pancreas weight might represent changes in digestive capability.",

On a relative basis, only a delay of 54 h posthatch had an adverse effect on the bursa, and this occurred at 4 d of age. Phelps et al.

Maltase activity decreased thereafter, most rapidly in poults given access to feed and water at 6 h posthatch. Sell et al. (1991) also reported greatest specific activity of maltase in 1-d-old poults, followed by a decrease in activity until 6 to 7 d of age. Specific activity of maltase has been used as an indicator of enterocyte maturity (Ortega et al., 1995) . Thus, the decline in specific activity of the jejunal maltase shortly after access to feed and water may be related to the rapid growth of the intestine that would result in a greater proportion of immature enterocytes containing less active maltase. Poults in the current research that were given access to feed and water 54 h posthatch tended to have greater specific activity of maltase in the jejunum (just before they were provided with feed and water) than poults placed at 6 or 30 h posthatch. When comparing the maltase activity on a relative basis (micromoles of maltase hydrolyzed hourly per 100 g of BW), poults placed within 6 h posthatch had the greatest maltase activity at 2 d of age. In Experiment 1, the relative maltase activity decreased after 1 through 10 d of age. The decrease did not occur until 2 d of age in Experiment 2, continuing until 15 d of age, then increasing through 28 d of age (Tables 9 and  11 ). The high level of maltase activity at 1 d of age suggests that turkey poults have the maltase required to digest maltose immediately after hatch.",

As observed by Sell et al. (1991) and Krogdahl and Sell (1989) , amylase activity generally increased with age. In the current study, at 1 d of age (30 h posthatch), all poults denied feed and water had greater relative amylase activity than poults placed within 6 h posthatch. By 2 d of age, poults denied feed until 54 h posthatch had the highest level of relative amylase activity. However, by Days 3, 4, and 5, poults deprived of feed for 54 h posthatch had the lowest levels of amylase activity per 100 g BW compared with poults placed within 6 h posthatch. In Experiments 1 and 2, relative amylase activity increased more than 5-fold by 2 d of age, whereas the specific activity increased only 1.5-fold by 2 d of age (Tables 9 and 11 ). These results agree with those of Moran (1982) , who reported that chicks have the ability to release sufficient amylase for digestion of carbohydrates, especially right after hatch. However, results of the current research indicate that a 54-h delay in placement may decrease amylase activity enough to affect nutrient utilization between 3 and 4 d of age.",

            "text": "Poults denied access to feed and water for 54-h posthatch had the highest relative and specific activities of pancreatic amylase, lipase, and trypsin at 2 d of age. These high levels agree with the observations of Hulan and Bird (1972) and Krogdahl and Sell (1989) that the act of eating serves as a stimulus to the pancreas to secrete pancreatic juice. At 2 d of age, the 54-h treatment group had not yet had access to the stimulus of feed and water, which may have resulted in increased concentrations of digestive enzymes in the pancreas. Krogdahl and Sell (1989) postulated that feeding also would stimulate pancreatic enzyme synthesis. This hypothesis could explain why poults placed on feed and water within 6 h Birds denied access to feed and water for 54 h posthatch had a slightly lower (P \u00a3 0.07) ME n value at 4 d of age (Table 12 ) than poults placed within 6 h after hatch. This effect on ME n occurred during the time when greatest physical and functional changes in the intestinal tract were observed. The ME n values determined at 4, 7, and 14 d of age, irrespective of placement times, were well below values calculated on the basis of ingredient data presented by the NRC (1994). At 4 d of age the determined ME n value of the diet for poults placed at 54 h posthatch was 10% less than the value determined for poults placed at 6 h posthatch and 23% less than calculated values. Soto-Salanova et al. (1991) and Sell (1996) reported the lowest ME n values for diets fed to poults at 4 and 7 d of age. The unusually low values obtained when poults were 14 d old in the current study are believed to be due, in part, to a coronavirus infection, which was first noted when poults were 12 d old. The infection was confirmed diagnostically at the Iowa State University Veterinary Medical Research Institute. This infection occurred after most of the effects of different placement times on intestinal development were observed and was assumed to not have had much impact on the effects of delayed placement.",

The inhibition of the development of these supply organs was transitory. By 4 wk of age, no significant physiological or functional differences were observed among supply organs of poults from different placement times. However, BW was still less at 28 d of age for poults denied feed for 54 h posthatch, showing that retardation of supply organ development had a carry-over effect on performance. Effects on GIT organs were more severe and longer lasting for poults denied feed for 54 h than for those denied feed for 30 h posthatch. Results of the current study show that substantial delays in access to feed and water will retard development of the digestive system and limit capabilities of poults to utilize dietary nutrients, resulting in reduced BW.",
