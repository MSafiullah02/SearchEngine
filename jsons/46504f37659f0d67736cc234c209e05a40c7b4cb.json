On March 13 (98 cases), the first cases of community transmission of Sars-CoV-2 occurred in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro cities, the two main Brazilian COVID-19 epicenters.Confirmed cases continued to grow fast in a classical exponential curve (made several fast and emergency decisions to reduce the velocity of the fast-growing number of infected people in the country and the number of casualties. For instance, in the Sao Paulo State, the main COVID-19 Brazilian epicenter, the timeline of the positive cases and the emergency decisions [3] are summaryzed in the Figure 1. According to the previous reports [2,4], these decisions purpose to protect elderly patients and people with comorbidities, to promote social distancing for avoiding fast Sars-CoV-2 dissemination, and c) to improve the health services related to the pandemic COVID-19. After 3 weeks of quarantine exclusion, it is clear that governmental decisions in the Sao Paulo State have significant effect on pandemic COVID-19 growing; average of increasing was 9.1% in the last week against 26.1% in the week before quarantine exclusion. However, it is still early to have precise conclusions and further emergency decisions can be required to reduce the COVID-19 growing spread. The Imperial College London [5] estimated the COVID-19 impact in several countries, including Brazil, according to different strategies for social distancing. Based on this report, specifically for the State of Sao Paulo (~46 million people, ~21.7% of the Brazilian population), considering early suppression and a transmissibility index (R 0 ) of 3, by the end of the pandemic, we can find the following estimates: limited capacity to attend all COVID-19 patients, it is important to flatten the pandemic COVID-19 curve to avoid the system overload. Assuming different effectiveness of the emergency decisions imposed by the government in reducing the growing spread of the Sars-CoV-2 by 25, 50, or",
