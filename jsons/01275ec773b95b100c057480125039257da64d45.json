Compared 178 with the binding to SARS-CoV RBD wild-type (WT) protein, neither 13B6 nor 18F3 179 bound to the RBD containing D392 and V394 mutations. Moreover, 13B6 did not bind 180 to the RBD containing D414 and F416 mutations, and 7B11 did not bind to the RBD 181 containing I428 and A430 mutations or the RBD containing K439 mutation (Fig. 3) . In 182 addition, 13B6 showed reduced binding to the RBDs containing V369/A371, 183 A371/K373, or Y481 mutations (Fig. 3) . This line of evidence suggests that the above 184 residues were the epitopes recognized by respective mAbs, among which residues 185 D392 and V394 in SARS-CoV RBD were conserved neutralizing epitopes 186 corresponding to residues D405 and V407 in SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and residues I428, 187 A430, and K439 in SARS-CoV RBD were neutralizing epitopes not fully conserved in 188 SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Fig. 4A) . receptor, the results revealed that 13B6 and 18F3 could not block such binding (Fig. 4B,  197 C). This might be due to that most or all epitopes recognized by 13B6 or 18F3 did not 198 overlap with the ACE2 binding sites on SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Li et al., 199 2005; Yan et al., 2020), while most epitopes recognized by 7B11 were very close to the 200 ACE2 binding sites (Fig. 4A ). In addition, control mAb 33G4 only blocked SARS-CoV 201 RBD, but not SARS-CoV-2 RBD, binding to the ACE2 receptor (Fig. 4B, C) , partially 202 explaining why this mAb did not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection. 203 Moreover, the two cross-neutralizing mAbs, 18F3 and 7B11, respectively recognized 227 two conserved, as well as several non-conserved, neutralizing epitopes on the RBDs of 228 SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. While 18F3 could not block the binding between RBD 229 and ACE2 receptor, 7B11 did block this binding, indicating that they recognized 230 epitopes different from, or close to, the receptor binding sites on the RBDs. 231 232 Notably, 7B11 had a relatively higher neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 233 infection than that against SARS-CoV infection, whereas its ability to inhibit the 234 SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 binding was relatively lower than that to inhibit the 235 SARS-CoV RBD-ACE2 binding, partially because that the neutralizing activity of 236 nAbs could not always be positively correlated with the inhibition of their binding to 237 the receptor. Other reasons might be due to that the binding between SARS-CoV-2 238 RBD and ACE2 receptor was much stronger than that between SARS-CoV RBD and 239 ACE2 (Tai et al., 2020) , potentially resulting in the reduced inhibition.

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2) (Gorbalenya et al., 2020) or human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-2019) 38 (Jiang et al., 2020c) has infected more than 3.2 million people globally, including more 39 than 229,000 deaths (case fatality rate 7%), in Africa, Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, 40 Europe, South-East Asia, and Western Pacific, as of May 02, 2020 (WHO, 2020). 41 Different from SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus 42 (MERS-CoV), two other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses (CoVs) causing 43 global epidemics in 2002, or continuous human infections (Zhong et al., 2003, Zaki et 44 al., 2012, Du et al., 2009), SARS-CoV-2 has superior human-to-human transmission 45 with rapid spread in humans (Zhu et al., 2020). Currently, no vaccines or therapeutics 46 are available to prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2-associated human infections, calling 47 for immediate efforts to develop effective countermeasures to control COVID-19 48 (Jiang et al., 2020a; Jiang, 2020). 49 50 The CoV spike (S) protein plays critical roles in viral infection and pathogenesis. It 51 consists of two subunits: S1 subunit binds cells expressing viral receptor through the 52 receptor-binding domain (RBD), whereas S2 subunit mediates fusion between the virus 53 and cell membrane (Liu et al., 2004; Du et al., 2009; Lu et al., 2014). Similar to 54 SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 recognizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its 55 cellular receptor, and its RBD (residues 331-524) shares about 70% sequence identity 56 with SARS-CoV RBD (Zhou et al., 2020). SARS-CoV spike (S) protein RBD is an 57 important vaccine and therapeutic target, and it induces potent neutralizing antibodies 58 against divergent strains of SARS-CoV infection (Du et al., 2009; Liu et al.previously developed a number of SARS-CoV RBD-specific mouse 62 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (He et al., 2006c; He et al., 2006a; He et al., 2005; He et 63 al., 2006b). In this study, we detected their cross-reactivity with a SARS-CoV-2 RBD 64 protein, as well as their cross-neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 S 65 protein-mediated viral entry. We found that six mAbs cross-reacted with SARS-CoV 66 RBD, two of which could neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection in human 67 ACE2 (hACE2)-expressing 293T cells (hACE2/293T), and one of which blocked the 68 binding between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 receptor. The cross-reactivity of these 69 mAbs with SARS-CoV-2 RBD, their cross-neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 70 pseudovirus infection, and their inhibition to block the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 71 binding were illustrated in Figure 1. We also identified the potential epitopes on the 72 RBD of SARS-CoV recognized by these two mAbs. Our study provides the possibility 73 of treating SARS-CoV-2 infection using SARS-CoV RBD-targeting neutralizing mAbs 74 (nAbs). 75 76 Materials and Methods 77 2.1. Construction, expression and purification of recombinant RBD proteins 78 The construction, expression and purification of recombinant SARS-CoV RBD wild 79 type (WT) and its mutant proteins, as well as SARS-CoV-2 protein, were performed as 80 previously described (Tai et al., 2020; Du et al., 2016; Tai et al., 2017). Briefly, genes 81 encoding residues 318-510 of SARS-CoV S protein and residues 331-524 of 82 SARS-CoV-2 S protein were respectively amplified by PCR using codon-optimized 83 SARS-CoV S protein (GenBank accession no. AY278488.2), or SARS-CoV-2 S 84 protein (GenBank accession no. QHR63250.1), as the template, and fused into 85 pFUSE-hIgG1-Fc2 vector (hereinafter named Fc, InvivoGen, San Diego, CA). 86 SARS-CoV RBD mutants were constructed based on SARS-CoV RBD WT plasmid 87 using the Multi Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). 88 Recombinant SARS-CoV RBD, SARS-CoV-2 RBD, or SARS-CoV RBD mutant 89 proteins (containing a C-terminal Fc tag) were expressed in 293T cells, secreted into 90 cell culture supernatants, and purified using protein A affinity chromatography (GE 91 Healthcare, Marlborough, MA). 92 93 2.2. ELISA 94 ELISA was performed to detect the reactivity of SARS-CoV RBD-specific mAbs 95 with SARS-CoV RBD, or cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein (Tai et al., 96 2020; Tai et al., 2017). Sera from mice immunized with SARS-CoV RBD protein and 97 a MERS-CoV RBD-specific mAb (Tai et al., 2020; Du et al., 2016) were used as 98",

SARS-CoV 117 RBD-immunized mouse sera and a MERS-CoV RBD-specific mAb were used as 118 controls (Tai et al., 2020; Du et al., 2016). Briefly, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 119 pseudoviruses were first generated as previously described (Tai et al., 2020). 293T 120 cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 S 121 protein and a plasmid expressing Env-defective, luciferase-expressing HIV-1 genome 122 (pNL4-3.luc.RE), using the calcium phosphate method. The culture medium was 123 replaced with fresh Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) 8 h later, and 124 pseudovirus-containing supernatants were collected 72 h later for single-cycle 125 infection in 293T cells expressing SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 receptor human ACE2 126 (hACE2/293T). A pseudovirus neutralization assay was then performed by incubating 127 SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus with SARS-CoV RBD-specific mAbs (10 128 and 1 \u03bcg/ml) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and then adding the mixture into cells. Fresh medium 129 was added 24 h later, and the cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, 130 WI) 72 h after infection. Luciferase substrate (Promega) was added to the lysed cell 131 supernatants, which were detected for relative luciferase activity using the Infinite 200 132 PRO Luminator (Tecan). The percent (%) pseudovirus neutralization was calculated. 133 134 2.4. Flow cytometry analysis 135 Flow cytometry analysis was performed to detect the inhibitory activity of 136 SARS-CoV RBD-specific nAbs on the binding of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 RBD 137 protein to hACE2/293T-expressing cells (Tai et al., 2020). Briefly, SARS-CoV RBD 138 or SARS-CoV-2 RBD (2 \u03bcg/ml) protein containing a C-terminal hFc was incubated 139 with the mAb (10 or 1 \u03bcg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature, and then the mixture was 140 added to the cells for another 30 min at room temperature. Human IgG-Fc protein was 141 added as negative control. The cells were further incubated with FITC-labeled goat 142 anti-human IgG-Fc antibody (1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 min and then 143 processed for flow cytometry analysis. 144 145 3. Results 146 We initially performed an ELISA to detect the cross-reactivity of 14 SARS-CoV 147 RBD-targeting mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein containing residues 331-524 148 of S antigen fused with a C-terminal Fc of human IgG1 (Tai et al., 2020). A SARS-CoV 149 RBD containing residues 318-510 of S protein fused with a C-terminal human Fc (Tai 150 et al., 2020) was used as comparison.

(A) Cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV RBD mAbs with SARS-CoV-2 371 RBD protein. (B) Reactivity of these mAbs with SARS-CoV RBD protein was 372 included as control. The binding of SARS-CoV RBD-specific mouse mAbs to 373 SARS-CoV-2 RBD (A) or SARS-CoV RBD (B) protein was detected by ELISA. The 374 data are presented as mean A450 value \u00b1 standard deviation of the mean (s.e.m.) (n = 375 3). (C) Cross-neutralizing activity of anti-SARS-CoV RBD mAbs against 376 SARS-CoV-2 infection. (D) Neutralizing activity of these mAbs against SARS-CoV 377 infection was used as control. Neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 (C) or SARS-CoV 378 (D) infection was detected by a pseudovirus neutralization assay in human ACE2 379 receptor-expressing 293T (hACE2/293T) cells. The percent (%) pseudovirus 380 neutralization was calculated based on the relative luciferase unit (RLU) of 381 pseudovirus infection with and without respective mAbs. The data are presented as 382 mean neutralization (%) \u00b1 s.e.m. (n = 3). For (A-D), SARS-CoV RBD-immunized 383 mouse sera were included as positive control (Pos con) since we have confirmed their 384 cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 RBD in previous studies (Tai et al., 2020), and 385 MERS-CoV RBD-specific mAb was used as negative control (Neg con). Each mAb 386 was detected at 10 and 1 \u03bcg/ml, respectively.

The 390 two (18F3 and 7B11) SARS-CoV RBD-specific nAbs with cross-neutralizing activity 391 against SARS-CoV-2 were detected for their potential recognition of epitopes on 392 SARS-CoV RBD. SARS-CoV RBD-targeting nAbs (33G4 and 13B6) without 393 cross-neutralizing activity were included as controls. The plates were coated with 394 SARS-CoV RBD wild type (WT) or each mutant protein (1 \u03bcg/ml), and the mAbs at 395 serial dilutions were added for binding. Arrows represent mAbs that did not bind to 396 mutant proteins at the indicated amino acid residues on SARS-CoV RBD, which are 397 epitopes recognized by the mAbs tested.
