Animal and human diseases are classified in several ways depending on the criteria, such as infectious and non-infectious diseases, contagious and non-contagious diseases, zoonotic and non-zoonotic diseases, and acute and chronic diseases. The infectious diseases are caused by virus, bacteria, mycoplasma, fungi or rickettsia depending on the nature of the etiological agent involved. Among the infectious diseases, viral diseases are most devastating and difficult to control as they usually spread very fast and unlike other infectious diseases have no cost-effective or safe antiviral antibiotics/drugs for the treatment. A new disease occurring in an area/host population spread further and get established in want of awareness, lack of diagnostic facility, expertise or other factors is termed as \u2018emerging disease\u2019. While disease of past, re-appearing in an area having a susceptible host population(s), is termed as \u2018re-emerging disease\u2019 (Lederberg et al. 1992; Daszak et al. 2000). Example of the latter is the re-emergence of human tuberculosis in many countries which earlier had negative status as a result of judicious control measures adopted; it re-appeared subsequently due to the spread of immunosuppressive human AID\u2019s virus, namely human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Introduction of susceptible animal populations/breeds from abroad for cross-breeding to upgrade the local breeds in India and other developing countries has resulted in the re-emergence of protozoon parasitic infections, such as theileria, babesia and anaplasma in the imported stock or their crossbreeds. The disease which is introduced from abroad into a country is termed as \u2018exotic\u2019.",

Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are those which have moved recently into a new host or have enhanced incidences or geographic range or are caused by evolving pathogens (Lederberg et al. 1992; Daszak et al. 2000). This general definition covers a range of infectious diseases of man and animals which pose a significant threat to both medical and veterinary public health. Among the OIE-listed diseases of viral aetiology, major changes have been experienced in the occurrence of rinderpest, peste-des-petits ruminants (PPR), foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), African swine fever (ASF), lumpy skin disease and Rift Valley fever (RVF). Of these, rinderpest presents a success story from the 1990s to 2011 as a result of FAO, OIE, EU and IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) guided and co-ordinated programmes including the Pan African Rinderpest Campaign (PARC), NPRE and NREP in India (Yadav 2011), Global Rinderpest Eradication Program (GREP) of the FAO and other national governments where the disease was endemic. These exemplary efforts led to the historic declaration of global rinderpest eradication by the FAO on June 28, 2011.",

This increased production is often required in peri-urban areas, having large human populations, under suboptimal husbandry practices. In such high-production areas, disease outbreaks affect a greater number of animals at a faster rate and speed, leading to heavy economic losses. Drastic control measures are taken, such as the slaughter of infected and in-contact animals followed by burning or burial is not acceptable to the society at large. For example, the mass slaughter of pigs in the Netherlands in 1997\u20131998 for the control of CSF virus led to objection from the non-farm population which might influence the application of the stamping-out policy as a disease control approach in future.",

The BTV serotype 8 revealed that this serotype is closest to the Nigerian strain. The incursion is believed to have been caused by the importation of an infected zoo animal or an infected midge.

Moreover, unlike human disease reporting, animal disease reporting systems are usually based on passive reporting rather than active disease surveillance. A few other factors are also responsible for greater threat due to TADs, namely (1) lack of awareness of the farmers about the high-threat epizootic animal diseases; (2) lack of diagnostic facilities for exotic diseases, and under-reporting of animal diseases like HPAI due to the fear of loss of internal and export market till the country gets infection-free status as per OIE-laid-down criteria; and (3) poor and faulty compensation schemes.",

Potential for pathogenic disease agents not reported previously in a country and being misused or mishandled for bioterrorism is likely to threaten the ecosystem on a large scale. Even new pathogens can be engineered as novel infectious agents. The animal diseases could even be a greater threat than human diseases as these may result in significant economic disruptions, besides causing food poisoning and deterioration, and zoonotic diseases in human beings. As animal diseases get less priority than human infections/diseases in undertaking immediate disease control measures, the threat scenario with the use of animal pathogens for bioterrorism or biowarfare will have many serious consequences. Some of the viruses having significant bioterror potential for humans and or animals include HPAI (H5N1), monkeypox virus, FMD virus, yellow fever virus, Spanish flu virus, poliovirus, AIDS virus (HIV), measles virus, Hendra virus, Nipah virus, SARS coronavirus, BSE prion agent and unknown agent(s) created through biotechnology and gene editing.",

Biosafety aims at the protection of person(s) at work and the facilities which are dealing with the biological agents, against their exposure to a disease agent, and prevents unintentional exposure to pathogens/toxins or their accidental release. Thus, biosafety is the application of knowledge, techniques and equipment to prevent personal, laboratory and environmental exposure to potentially infectious agents or biohazards. Biosecurity, unlike biosafety, has divergent meanings in different contexts in which it is used. It deals with the protection of microbiological assets from spill-over, theft, loss, diversion or intentional release from laboratories, preventing the import of certain organisms/toxins. Biosecurity is a set of preventive measures designed to reduce the risk of intentional transmission of infectious diseases to safeguard the facilities containing sensitive biological materials with the potential of a biological weapon. In brief, biosecurity means bio-risk management. Once a disease is eradicated globally, the policy for keeping the wild and vaccine strains of the virus along with vaccine stocks for emergency use and their subsequent destruction is decided by international agencies like FAO, WHO and OIE based on the recommendations of experts in the area.",

The OIE has facilitated safe trade in animals and animal products by developing effective standards to prevent the spread of animal diseases across the globe. Prevention of transmission of pathogens across intra- and inter-country borders warrants devising of biosecurity measures at par with international standards. Adequate infrastructure comprising check posts and quarantine facilities at seaports, airports and porous international land border are must to check the ingress of viral and other pathogens from across the borders.

Visitors to the livestock farm, disease laboratory, birds, rodents, vehicles, feed and fodder and other inanimate objects are often a source of infection. In addition to adverse effects on the economy, there can be negative effects on the environment and human health. The best designs are to implement effective biosecurity practices. Baths by the laboratory workers after and before visiting animal farm or laboratory and putting on gum boots, disposable overall, head gear and gloves should be a mandatory requirement. All effluent from the laboratory should be pre-treated to ensure freedom from pathogens before their disposal to the environment. Disinfectant foot bath for the workers and vehicles entering the farm at the gate, exclusive separate dress and shoes for laboratory and farm workers, minimum movement of the people and animals within the farm during the outbreak period, and personal health and hygiene of the staff are some of the minimum guidelines to strengthen farm biosecurity.",

To face the new exotic diseases, it is recommended to have a standard SOP in place along with technical guidelines, decision-taking levels along with adequate provision for funds and legal backup. It has been observed that lack or inadequate compensation for culling the diseased and in-contact animals and poultry and negative effect on the sale, sale price and exports deter the farmers from reporting animal diseases in time which eventually leads to the spread of TADs. For example, due to BSE cattle producers in the USA lost over $1 billion in exports to Japan. Similarly, HPAI resulted in over $1 billion loss in poultry exports for Thailand. Trade concerns also discourage the use of preventive vaccinations for some diseases such as HPAI and FMD. Disease-free countries are generally reluctant to import animals or animal products from the countries practicing preventive vaccinations. With these adverse trade considerations, stamping-out policy was adopted by the UK over the vaccination for FMD in 2001 outbreak. From a public health point of view, a vaccination programme might reduce the viral load circulating in a country and thus reduce the risk of HPAI spreading to humans. However, stamping out rather than vaccination is preferred by most of the countries to declare themselves free from disease/infection at the earliest possible to regain access to exports. To ensure the cooperation of livestock farmers, it is essential to provide adequate and timely compensations to reduce the losses suffered by them on account of culling and closing the units for a few months.",

The virus affected wild birds as well as domestic poultry. Sporadic cases of transmission to humans in close contact of infected birds with sizeable mortality raised the pandemic concern of \u2018bird flu\u2019. After the first report of the H5N1 virus from India and Bangladesh in 2006 and 2007, respectively, both these countries are experiencing outbreaks almost every year. Between February\u2013March 2006 and February 2019, India incurred an expenditure of more than INR 1098.7 million, including INR 263.7 million for compensation and INR 835 million on the culling of 8.349 million birds (Anonymous 2018\u201319). Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have become a continued threat to global health and economy. After its first outbreak in 2014, the H5N8 HPAI serotype disseminated very fast from Korea to other parts of Asia, Europe and North America, a feature not observed in case of other highly pathogenic AIVs. However, the pathobiological features of the virus that favoured its global translocation are not known. Results of simulation studies undertaken in migratory birds to identify pathobiological features supporting AIV intercontinental dissemination risk suggest that characteristic differences exist among H5N8 and other AIV subtypes, e.g. H5N6 and H5N1 that have not spread as rapidly. Lower infection recovery and mortality rates and migration recovery rates also favour translocation in migratory bird populations. Although India has been reporting H5N1 AIV since 2006, the H5N8 virus was first time reported in 2017 from migratory birds and poultry in the states of Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka, Punjab and Haryana. Studies undertaken on comparative epidemiology of influenza viruses H5N1 and H7N9 among human and bird populations to find out similarities and differences between the two viruses in their genetic characteristics, distribution patterns in human and bird populations and postulated mechanisms of global spread (Bui et al. 2014) indicated that H7N9 viruses are diversifying at a much greater rate than H5N1 viruses. Analyses of certain H7N9 strains demonstrated similarities with engineered transmissible H5N1 viruses, which make it more adaptable to the human respiratory tract. These differences in the epidemiology of H5N1 and H7N9 viruses in human and birds raise further questions as to how H7N9 has spread at a greater rate than the H5N1 virus.",

Although first described in 1921 and it affected more than 50 countries in Africa, Europe and South America, several key issues about its pathogenesis, immune evasion and epidemiology remain uncertain (Arias et al. 2017). In the absence of a vaccine, the disease causes greater sanitary, social and economic impacts on swine herds compared to many other swine diseases. Currently, ASF is present in sub-Saharan Africa, Sardinia, the Trans-Caucasus, the Russian Federation and Central and Eastern states of the European Union. The disease continues to spread, with first reports in China (August 2018), Bulgaria (August 2018), Belgium (September 2018) and Vietnam (February 2019) highlighting the increasing threat of ASF to the global pig industry (Netherton et al. 2019). Ongoing outbreaks have also been reported in Hungary, Latvia, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Russia, South Africa, Ukraine, Cambodia, North Korea, Vietnam and Laos. The disease was rampant in China during 2019, and about half of China\u2019s breeding pigs died or were slaughtered. The threat of ASF looms large as presently no licensed vaccine is available against this disease, and further research is desired in this area for the development of live attenuated vaccines for ASFV. It has been possible to generate pigs resistant to classical swine fever virus and PRRS virus (Burkard et al. 2018) by using genetic modification of the host species. Genetic modification can be attempted as a viable solution to increase the host resistance to ASFV. Wild suids, namely warthog or bush pig, sequences could be engineered into the domestic pig genome to produce animals in which replication of ASF virus and/or disease burden after ASFV infection is reduced. However, to generate pigs fully resistant to ASFV infection, a more effective strategy such as targeting the virus receptors on the host cell to block the entry of virus and viral replication may be attempted.",

Such studies will provide a complete understanding of the pathogenesis of ASF. The specific role of different hosts including wild suids, vectors and environmental factors in disease propagation needs to be elucidated for understanding different epidemiological scenarios. In this regard, the northern European scenario in which infected wild boars drive disease transmission and maintenance needs to be investigated further. Presently, ASF has become of great significance in China and a real threat to the pig and pork production. The affected countries are planning to compensate for the losses in pork production by increasing broiler poultry production.",

            "text": "After the successful eradication of rinderpest from the globe in 2011, foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) of cloven-footed animals is another OIE-listed important viral disease inflicting heavy economic losses and adversely affecting the trade of livestock and livestock products from endemic countries to FMD-free nations/regions. Knight-Jones et al. (2016) have given a detailed account of global FMD research update along with gaps and an overview of global status and research needs. The conclusions are drawn to highlight that currently available vaccines and control tools have enabled FMD eradication from many countries of the developed world. However, in many developing countries, FMD remains uncontrolled. The main reason given is that biosecurity measures that have been fundamental to successful FMD control in the developed country are difficult to be implemented effectively in developing countries due to obvious reasons. In the present scenario, improved vaccines, with longer lasting protection against a wider range of FMDV strains and lower production costs, could be the single most important development to enhance our ability to control FMD. Although encouraging progress has been made with several novel vaccine candidates, addressing key limitations of the current inactivated vaccines, a commercial vaccine is yet awaited. While new discoveries are crucial, current vaccines have been used to effectively control FMD on numerous occasions. However, for imparting better immunity, FMD vaccines should be subjected to adequate quality assurance and be made available in sufficient quantity to provide desired coverage following appropriate strategy. There is also a need for better training and support in the design and execution of vaccine-based FMD control programmes. Another area of research is genetic and molecular studies on the virus to elucidate host-virus interactions. More powerful tools and analyses are increasing our understanding of various aspects of FMDV evolution, ecology and epidemiology. This, in turn, should benefit many areas of FMD research, from basic virology to the vaccine and diagnostic development. Furthermore, improved genetic technologies have the potential to reveal information crucial for control, such as transmission chains, vaccine match and level of virus circulation.",

Besides traditional bastions of established research institutes in Europe and North and South America, notable work is being conducted in China, India and Africa. Experiences in South America and Europe have shown that through decades of sustained investment FMD can be controlled, even in regions where once it was rampant and control was seemingly impossible. However, if improved and more widespread FMD control is to be achieved, continued investment in FMD research at the local and international level is a must. Improved DIVA diagnostics increase our ability to detect infected animals in vaccinated populations. Greater confidence in the ascertainment of FMD status of animals and products has, in turn, opened the way for international standards for trade and disease control that are more efficient and less restrictive. Rigorous licensing procedures increase the time taken for new technologies for diagnostic kits and vaccines to reach the market. However, if authorisation is less rigorous, substandard products may be released onto the market. Hence, there is a need to balance these two requirements. Relaxation should be provided for necessary changes to the existing technologies, such as changing vaccine strains, particularly when the need is urgent (Knight-Jones et al. 2016).",

In India mortality rate of about 200,000 animals were recorded among the affected bovine population of 400,000 per annum during the first half of the 1950s, indicating average mortality of 50%. Throughout the history of humankind, the social, economic and ecological consequences due to rinderpest had been more catastrophic, even changing the history of nations and empires. In India, the presence of rinderpest was confirmed by the Cattle Plague Commission (Hallen et al. 1871). This disease has been conquered successfully by following mass vaccination along with zoo sanitary measures. The FAO declared the global eradication of rinderpest on 28 June 2011, marking it the first ever viral disease of animals eradicated globally about three decades after the eradication of smallpox, a viral disease of humans in 1980 (Yadav et al. 2016). Constraints of availability of quality vaccine in sufficient quality, freeze-drying of vaccines and maintenance of cold chain for a vaccine in tropical countries, lack of infrastructure for structured clinical surveillance and sero-surveillance were some of the limitations in executing the mass vaccination programmes. In India, dividing the country into four zones based on the epidemiological picture of the disease and adopting strategic and focused vaccinations at interstate and international borders and migration routes of bovines and caprine for creating immune belts, coupled with rigorous clinical and sero-surveillance, were of great help in achieving freedom from the infection. The financial support and/or technical guidance from FAO, OIE, EU and IAEA were the driving forces in achieving infection-free status for India in the year 2006. With the successful eradication of rinderpest, the livestock sector across the globe became safer, and consequently the living standard of livestock farmers improved.",

In this regard, pen-side diagnostic tests/lab-on-the chip tools are the need of the hour. The hurdles of sampling need to be curtailed opting non-invasive methods for sample collection from different animal species and wildlife. Transparency in disease reporting needs to be adhered to and reported to OIE. Because of trading in animals and animal products, the international obligation for OIE reportable diseases of high importance must be followed by all member countries of WTO. It is high time to apply developed diagnostics and molecular detection tools in the field to ensure fast detection and confirmation of pathogens capable of causing diseases in humans and animals. This must be accompanied by national-level disease surveillance, monitoring and networking to enable an early warning system for infectious diseases based on forecasting (Saminathan et al. 2016). Due priority is also required for development and application of new potent, safe and affordable vaccines and vaccine delivery systems and adopting innovative vaccination programmes and immunomodulatory and effective therapeutic modalities, which would help in devising timely prevention and control strategies against viral and other infectious diseases.

Application of artificial intelligence (AI), GPS, remote sensing and traceability in disease detection and management needs priority attention in developing countries. Similarly, the latest techniques of gene editing, base editing, nanotechnologies, electronic nose, etc. should be applied for efficient disease diagnosis and drug delivery. While planning the breeding policies for livestock and poultry, both higher production performance and health of the progeny should be given equal weightage.
