Recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported a rise in the cases of measles in United States in the first 4 months of 2008 [1]. This outbreak is believed to have originated in parts of Europe and Israel where immunization rates have declined because of parental concerns regarding vaccine safety. Furthermore, 63 of the 64 patients with confirmed cases in the United States were not immunized against measles. Despite the seemingly small number of patients involved, this outbreak and the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak serve as reminders of the global nature of modern epidemics in an age where international air travel is commonplace. It also highlights the potential dangers of vaccine noncompliance on herd immunity, a central factor in a community's defenses against a real measles epidemic 2, 3. Therefore, patients presenting with fever and rash should be asked about recent travel, exposure to visitors from other countries, and immunization status.",

Because of the nature of this illness, patients with measles will usually be brought to medical attention. Inasmuch as physicians training today are not likely to have encountered measles, raising awareness of this resurgent disease may prove to be of great importance in combating the next outbreak. After an incubation period of 4 to 12 days, clinical symptoms usually begin with high fever and the classic triad of cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis (\u201cthe three C's\u201d). Koplik spots, tiny white spots surrounded by a red ring present on the buccal mucosa, are pathognomonic for measles, but should not be relied on because they may be present for less than a day. The classic measles rash is an erythematous, maculopapular exanthem that appears after a child has been ill for several days. It starts from the forehead or posterior occipital area and spreads to the trunk and extremities within 3 days. The rash fades from red to copper brown and disappears in the same cephalocaudal direction [4]. Although such a quick review of signs and symptoms of measles can be helpful, clinicians encountering a possible case of measles should draw on the experience of older physicians and those from countries where measles may have been a common part of their clinical experience.",

Scarlet fever outbreaks killed thousands in Europe in the 1600s and in the New World in 1736, with mortality rates of 25% to 35%. Outbreaks of rheumatic fever and acute glomerulonephritis have also been documented through history. Each of these outbreaks reached its resolution without the availability of antibiotics, but not without taking a heavy toll. With the advent of penicillin and readily available testing, the mortality associated with scarlet fever and other GAS diseases dropped dramatically [5].",

High person-to-person transmission rates also account for the very high intrafamilial spread of this disease. Once colonized intranasally, carriers may have upward of 4 times higher rates of infection. The spread of CA-MRSA has culminated in what many are calling an epidemic [17]. The CDC estimates that between 1998 and 2005, the cases of MRSA doubled. A recent multicenter study found that CA-MRSA is the most common pathogen identified in patients with skin and soft tissue infections presenting to EDs in the United States [18].",

Incision and drainage should be used for all infectious collections likely to be due to CA-MRSA. In fact, some data suggest that smaller isolated abscesses (<5 cm) that are not associated with any signs and symptoms of systemic diseases may be managed with simple incision and drainage alone [20]. Systemic antibiotics are warranted for larger abscesses and cellulitis. For CA-MRSA, methicillin resistance is encoded by the mec-IV plasmid. This plasmid is smaller than the plasmid found in hospital-acquired MRSA and does not encode antibiotic resistance to non\u2013\u03b2-lactam antibiotics. As a result, agents such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, clindamycin, and doxycycline, which have been around for many years, may be effective in treating CA-MRSA in the outpatient setting. Nonetheless, resistance patterns are community specific; and antimicrobiograms should be reviewed regularly to determine current susceptibilities. Vancomycin has been the mainstay of intravenous therapy for MRSA, and reports of vancomycin-resistant MRSA are rare. Alternative agents that may be useful in the treatment of serious CA-MRSA infections include linezolid, daptomycin quinupristin/dalfopristin, and tigecycline [21]. An unusual property of CA-MRSA is its tendency to cause recurrent skin infections. Affected individuals may benefit from strategies designed to eradicate carriage of this organism. The optimal strategy for decontamination remains to be determined; but recommendations have included the following approaches, both separately and in combination: nasal application of mupirocin, chlorhexidine baths, and even systemic antimicrobial therapy [14].",

Initial nonspecific symptoms of fever, headache, myalgia, and abdominal pain may be quickly followed by signs and symptoms of shock [22]. The rash may also progress rapidly from macular, maculopapular, or urticarial to petechiae and purpura, or ecchymosis.

These dermatologic manifestations reflect underlying vasculitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation induced by the organism. Most deaths occur within the first 48 hours of illness. Case fatality has been reported to be as high as 50%.

Mortality rate for cutaneous cases are usually less than 1%, whereas inhalational and gastrointestinal forms can exceed 50%. The disease, in its most common cutaneous form, causes vesicles or papules at the site of exposed, broken skin. Over several days, the vesicles may rupture, leaving a necrotic ulcer, with subsequent development of a painless black eschar (Figure 2\n). There is usually surrounding edema and erythema with regional lymphadenopathy. All forms of anthrax have an incubation period of less than 2 weeks. With the inhalational form, an initial prodrome of nonspecific, flu-like symptoms (fatigue, fever, sweats, cough, and vomiting) is followed in 2 to 5 days with dyspnea, hypoxia, and fulminant shock. Early chest x-ray findings of hilar fullness, mediastinal widening and effusions, or hemorrhagic infiltrates can be helpful in distinguishing early anthrax from viral infections. The gastrointestinal form can initially present with either oropharyngeal ulcers or symptoms of nausea, anorexia, or vomiting followed by signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal bleed and shock. In all suspected cases of anthrax, patients should be initially treated with either ciprofloxacin or doxycycline regardless of the patient's age until susceptibility testing indicates otherwise 5, 27, 28.",
