ST was especially common in patients with lower respiratory tract infections and occurred most frequently in the mild thrombocytosis group (500\u2013699 \u00d7 109/L). Previous studies showed that ST occurs in 9\u201348% of patients with respiratory tract infections789. The different incidence rates may be explained by the cutoff platelet count, study population (inpatients, outpatients, or both), and median age of the enrolled subjects. Additionally, the platelet count peaked on the 11th day after the onset of illness. This also supports the findings by other investigators who reported that platelet count in ST peaked during the second and third week of the illness917. In our cases, the highest incidence of ST occurred in patients who were under two years of age (94.5%), which is consistent with the Mastubara et al. study of Japanese children with thrombocytosis, more than 80% of whom were aged less than two years18. Because bone marrow precursor cells of younger infants are more sensitive and rapid to external stimuli such as infections.",

The total virus detection rate was 78.9% (645/817) in patients with ST. RSV (39.5%) was the most commonly detected virus, followed by HRV (22.6%) and PIV (21.8%). From the present data, we found that RSV single infection (especially subtype B) and HRV infection (especially subtype A) were prominent causative agents of thrombocytosis. To our knowledge, our study is the first to find that ST occurrence is associated with HRV infection. In addition, HBoV1 co-infection with other viruses in the mild thrombocytosis group is more common than in the moderate to severe thrombocytosis groups. This may be because this group of patients is frequently co-infected with RSV and HRV. According to the above results, we speculate that increased platelet counts may be indicative of a respiratory tract inflammatory reaction after RSV or HRV infection.",

            "text": "The mechanism by which infection can promote thrombocytosis has not yet been fully elucidated. Reports in the literature show that ST is related to increased endogenous levels of several cytokines, such as thrombopoietin (TPO), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-1alpha (IL-1a) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a)192021. It has been found that during RSV infection, many infants demonstrated RSV-specific cytokine responses, such as increased levels of IL-6 and IL-822. However, ST caused by HRV infection has not been described. Bronchial epithelial cells secrete a wide variety of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF, and these cytokines are responsible for the development of thrombocytosis following RSV and HRV infections2324. Furthermore, TPO concentrations usually correlate with CRP levels2526. Among our thrombocytotic patients, 16.1% (132) had elevated CRP levels; this could indicate that CRP participates in thrombocytosis. Some authors have suggested that anemia may also play a role, and we observed a higher rate of anemia in the thrombocytosis group57. Another theory confirmed that the number of megakaryocytes increased and that the pulmonary capillary bed released more platelets due to stimulation by TPO after infection. We believe the specific viral agents that cause RTI induce inflammatory response and circulating cytokines that can then lead to ST and perhaps other hematological disorders.",
