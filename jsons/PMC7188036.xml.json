Despite these measures, however, exponential spread and diagnosis has occurred, overwhelming hospitals around the country. As of April 3, 2020, there were more than 240,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, including more than 6200 deaths.2 Although health systems have primarily focused on ventilator and PPE availability with most elective cases being canceled, the orthopaedic trauma community is still operating, tending to the fractures that still occur during this global pandemic. With little guidance provided by the CDC and WHO, the following hopes to summarize and provide relevant information to the practicing orthopaedic traumatologist in maximizing outcomes while limiting exposure when operating during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The overall goal is to create a system-sustaining model that allows for appropriate resource allocation to provide optimal patient care, while minimizing viral spread to other patients and members of the treatment team. For example, Schwartz et al9 describe the creation of a two-team system where each team functions completely independent of one another with one team working in the hospital and the other working remotely. In this system, the teams are designed to transition every other week, allowing for the appropriate incubation period for the viral symptoms to be present before the return to hospital. Therefore, symptoms that arise during the time away from the hospital and direct patient contact allow for recognition, quarantine, and by default, minimal exposure to the rest of the team.9 Given that exposed individuals may remain asymptomatic for up to 14 days,10 consideration should be given to establishing a 3-team approach where one team is working in the hospital involved in direct patient care, while the other teams are rotating through 14 days away from the hospital essentially working remotely in a cyclical \u201cquarantine\u201d between episodes of direct patient care. This team-based system approach can also be used for trainees and midlevel providers to limit exposure and spread of the virus. The authors understand that it is difficult to \u201cwork remotely\u201d in our line of work, but minimizing unnecessary contact with colleagues and patients can help minimize the spread of the virus. Many facilities have also closed lounges and workspaces to promote social distancing of workforce members.",

Although consultation for musculoskeletal conditions in the emergency department and inpatient setting must continue, many of the author's institutions have been performing electronic consultations for conditions that do not require in-person evaluation; however, in those circumstances, the consulting service and patient/family are called, and proper documentation of the assessment and plan including follow-up care is mandatory.

To mitigate this, several measures can easily be implemented in clinic to minimize unnecessary follow-up, thus minimizing the risk of potential exposure. Considerations should be made to limit in-person clinic visits to the following: immediate postop visit for suture removal (when not able to be removed elsewhere or resorbable sutures are not used), fracture reduction check for nonoperatively managed fractures that had a reduction and splint or cast applied, new acute fractures, patients with potential or concern for complications, and those patients with a potential weight-bearing status change that requires x-rays and/or cast removal before making the decision.11 Furthermore, when feasible for this last subset of patients, x-rays can be ordered with the patient obtaining them at a location close to their home with subsequent review and treatment recommendations provided during a telehealth visit eliminating the need for an in-person clinic visit. Additional surgeon-controlled variables such as the use of resorbable suture and removable splints described in more detail later can also be used to minimize clinical follow-up during the pandemic.",

Several cities in the United States are already consolidating care to designated hospitals (for inpatients) or surgery centers (for outpatients) for fracture care. Most patients presenting to the outpatient clinics that have surgically indicated fractures have injuries that can be managed in outpatient settings. Ideally, patients undergoing surgical fracture care would be screened and tested for COVID-19 preoperatively (as close to surgery as possible) irrespective of the surgical setting to minimize exposure.8 If a patient tests positive, then consideration should be given to managing the fracture nonoperatively or delaying surgery until the patient has cleared the virus when appropriate. Despite these recommendations, some patients with COVID-19 will require operative fixation of their injuries, and it is imperative that the surgical team optimizes the treatment plan to minimize patient morbidity while also minimizing potential spread of the virus.",

In addition, rapid approval of medical licenses for surrounding states during this pandemic and improvement in billing for telehealth clinical visits has likely contributed to more mainstream adoption.15",
