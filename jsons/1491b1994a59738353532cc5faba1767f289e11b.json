In this paper, we consider multiple competing viruses over static and dynamic graph structures, and investigate the eradication and propagation of diseases in these systems.

In this paper we focus exclusively on susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) models, which have been developed for both continuous [2] - [5] and discrete time domains [5] - [7] . SIS models consist of a number of agents that are either infected or healthy (susceptible), which may cycle (aperiodically) between these two states. The infection rate combined with the connectivity of the ith agent with infected neighbors j (denoted by \u03b2 ij ) positively affects the probability of being infected, while the healing rate \u03b4 i negatively affects the infection probability. This is depicted in Figure 1a .",

However these models can have broader applications to political stances, adaptation of competing products, competing practices in farming, etc. and can be generalized to more than two viruses. Consider, for example, the case of three competing viruses; then each state has four possible states: susceptible, infected with virus 1, 2, or 3. The idea of information diffusion on two layered networks has also been explored for a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model in [14] .",

There are recent results for the single virus model over time-varying networks [16] - [20] . Some of the ideas from [19] , [20] will be employed in this paper and applied to a more general model. Various control techniques have been applied to SIS virus systems [13] , [21] - [23] . These techniques assume the healing rate is a control variable. In [13] , it is shown that there exists no distributed linear feedback control that can stabilize the system, and in fact, will destabilize the system. Alternative approaches focus on reducing the maximum eigenvalue of the linearized system using the healing rate and/or the infection rate. In [21] , [22] , distributed control techniques for setting healing rate and quarantine protocols are proposed and implemented on a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) simulation model. In [23] , a bound is provided for the cost of fairness of mitigating the spread of disease, that is, the difference between the optimal solution and the fair or homogeneous solution, for several classes of graphs. In [25] , geometric programming ideas are used to control single SIS virus systems and the authors present a polynomial time algorithm illustrated on an air transportation network. In [24] , similar ideas to [25] are applied to the bi-virus model.",

Therefore, Algorithm 1 performed the best, however both had significant improvements over the uncontrolled simulation. The maximum eigenvalues of the three linearized systems are, from left to right, 1.893, 0.557, and 0.421; so none of the linearized systems are Hurwitz.
