Three distinct types of classic Fc\u03b3Rs have been described: one with high\u2010affinity for Fc\u03b3RI and two low\u2010affinity receptors, Fc\u03b3RII and Fc\u03b3RIII [\n1\n, \n2\n]. Cross\u2010linking of Fc\u03b3Rs by IgG\u2010opsonized particles or IgG\u2010containing immunocomplexes triggers an intracellular cascade of biochemical events that leads to a variety of important cellular functions such as phagocytosis, immune regulation, cytolysis, and transcriptional activation of cytokine\u2010encoding genes, which initiate inflammatory responses related to protection against bacterial infection, autoimmunity, and hypersensitivity [\n3\n, \n4\n, \n5\n, \n6\n, \n7\n].",

In the hematopoietic system, CD13 is expressed on stem cells and during most developmental stages of myeloid cells [\n12\n], and for this reason, it is widely used as a marker of myelomonocytic cells in the diagnosis of hematopoietic malignant disorders. Furthermore, CD13 participates in angiogenesis regulation [\n13\n], cellular motility, and dendritic cell (DC)\u2010induced T cell activation [\n14\n]. CD13 is also a receptor for human coronavirus 229E and other enteropathogenic coronaviruses [\n15\n] and participates in human cytomegalovirus infection [\n16\n, \n17\n]. Moreover, the possibility of CD13 being a receptor for the coronavirus responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome has been suggested recently [\n18\n]. Because of its ectopeptidase activity, CD13 has been implicated in the regulation of vasoactive peptides, neuropeptide hormones, and immunomodulating peptides such as interleukin\u20106 and \u20108 (IL\u20106 and IL\u20108, respectively) [\n19\n, \n20\n, \n21\n, \n22\n].",

            "text": "Cooperation between CD13 and Fc\u03b3Rs was first suggested when McIntyre et al. [\n24\n] in 1989 proposed that the Ca++ increase induced by anti\u2010CD13 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) in the human monocytic cell line U\u2010937 could result from mAb\u2010induced formation of membrane complexes between the antigen (CD13) and the Fc\u03b3Rs. The involvement of Fc\u03b3Rs in CD13\u2010mediated signaling was deduced from two observations: the effect could not be reproduced using F(ab)\u20322 fragments of the antibody, and the magnitude of this effect varied according to the isotype of the anti\u2010CD13 antibody tested [\n24\n]. However, the conclusion that CD13 signals through Fc\u03b3Rs has been challenged by the observation that inhibition of the enzymatic activity of CD13, which in principle would not alter the formation of the CD13\u2010Fc\u03b3R complexes, blocks the CD13\u2010mediated signal, although other reports showed that enzymatic activity is not required for CD13\u2010mediated signaling [\n26\n, \n27\n].",

Moreover, they showed that induction of differentiation of these cells with 1,25\u2010dyhydroxyvitamin D3, which increases the phagocytic capacity of monocytes, diminishes CD13 expression in cells with low, but not in those with high, phagocytic capacity, suggesting a role for CD13 in phagocytosis [\n28\n].",

However, a possible functional cooperation between Fc\u03b3Rs and CD13 had already been suggested [\n23\n, \n24\n], and the results presented in this paper further support a possible functional involvement of CD13 in Fc\u03b3R\u2010mediated functions in monocytic cells.",

Redistribution of CD13 to these zones is probably an active process, as incubation of monocytic cells with IgG\u2010opsonized erythrocytes at 4\u00b0C does not induce redistribution of CD13. This also suggests that CD13 redistribution is related to the initiation of the internalization process and induced by signals generated by the Fc\u03b3RI aggregation rather than simply to the binding of IgG\u2010opsonized erythrocytes. Moreover, a significant fraction of CD13 molecules is internalized into the phagosomes with IgG\u2010opsonized erythrocytes, suggesting a role for CD13 in phagocytosis. Additionally, some CD13\u2010associated red fluorescence is also observed in the cytoplasm after phagocytosis. This may be attributable to endocytosis of CD13 occurring simultaneously to the phagocytic process. In this regard, Lohn et al. [\n33\n] reported endocytosis of CD13 at 37\u00b0C after occupation of the active center of CD13 with a mAb. Yet, another explanation for the presence of cytoplasmic CD13 can be the retrotranslocation of CD13 to the external phagosomal membrane (as suggested by CD13 distribution in Fig. 2A) and later, to the cytosol (Figs. 1M, and 2C). Houde et al. [\n34\n] have shown retrotranslocation of phagosomal contents to the external phagosomal membrane and their subsequent presence in the cytoplasm 60 min after incubation of macrophages with latex\u2010ovalbumin beads.",

Peripheral blood monocytes and U\u2010937 cells preincubated with the anti\u2010CD13 mAb or its F(ab)\u20322 fragments were able to ingest EBS\u2010Ab, but cells preincubated without anti\u2010CD13 mAb or with other murine mAb of the same isotype specific for another highly expressed molecule of monocytes (CD33) or for a nonrelated antigen (DNP) do not ingest EBS\u2010Ab. Furthermore, increasing doses of anti\u2010CD13 mAb go along with a parallel increase in phagocytosis of EBS\u2010Ab by monocytes. These findings show that phagocytosis of EBS\u2010Ab is mediated specifically by CD13. Thus, CD13 is not only able to positively modulate Fc\u03b3RI\u2010mediated phagocytosis, but under certain circumstances, it is able to mediate phagocytosis to an extent similar to that of Fc\u03b3RI (Fig. 3D), which might suggest that the increased phagocytic index observed when both molecules are engaged results from the sum of the individual phagocytosis. However, we cannot be certain of whether the effect of CD13 on Fc\u03b3RI\u2010mediated phagocytosis when both receptors are coaggregated is additive or synergistic. One point that might suggest that it is not an additive event is that the magnitude of the effect is not directly proportional to the phagocytic index observed with CD13 alone. Conversely, for a synergistic effect to be invoked, one would expect that at a given point, the phagocytosis obtained by engaging CD13 and Fc\u03b3RI should be significantly higher than the sum of the phagocytosis mediated by each receptor alone, and this was never observed. Nevertheless, the finding that CD13 is able to modulate Fc\u03b3RI\u2010mediated phagocytosis is noteworthy regardless of the synergistic or additive origin of the phenomenon.",

This clearly shows that coaggregation of CD13 results in a modification of the biochemical signal elicited by Fc\u03b3RI cross\u2010linking. The absolute requirement of Syk during Fc\u03b3R\u2010mediated phagocytosis is well established [\n35\n], and thus, it is tempting to propose that this effect could be related to the increased phagocytosis observed when the particle is able to cross\u2010link Fc\u03b3RI and CD13. It is interesting that cross\u2010linking of CD13 alone does not induce changes in the level of Syk phosphorylation, suggesting that CD13 cross\u2010linking only affects the level of Syk phosphorylation when it is coaggregated with Fc\u03b3RI. As CD13 was able to mediate phagocytosis, the biochemical pathways involved in this phenomenon are apparently independent of Syk phosphorylation. These results are in line with those of Navarrete Santos et al. [\n23\n], who showed that inhibitors of tyrosine kinases were not able to block the initial Ca++ peak induced by CD13 cross\u2010linking in monocytes.",

Moreover, when aggregation of Fc\u03b3RI is induced by an anti\u2010Fc\u03b3RI mAb and a secondary antibody, part of the CD13 population redistributes to the zones of Fc\u03b3RI aggregation. Conversely, aggregation of CD13 by anti\u2010CD13 and secondary antibody induces an almost complete redistribution of Fc\u03b3RI in peripheral blood monocytes and U\u2010937 cells. As a control, Fc\u03b3RI aggregation does not induce redistribution of CD33.",

            "text": "Taken together, our results demonstrate that Fc\u03b3R aggregation (induced by IgG\u2010opsonized erythrocytes or secondary antibodies) induces coredistribution of CD13, a phenomenon that could be of functional relevance, as under experimental conditions in which both molecules are coaggregated (i.e., phagocytosis of EBS\u2010Ab and co\u2010cross\u2010linking for Syk phosphorylation determinations), a positive modulation of the Fc\u03b3R\u2010induced signal is observed. The in vivo significance of the functional interaction between CD13 and Fc\u03b3RI remains to be established. An intriguing possibility is that CD13 establishes interactions with pathogen\u2010derived molecules and that when CD13 and Fc\u03b3Rs bind to their ligands (i.e., an IgG\u2010opsonized and CD13 ligand\u2010containing pathogen), a positive modulation of the Fc\u03b3R\u2010mediated signal occurs. Although a natural ligand for human CD13 on the surface of a phagocytable pathogen has not been described, its role as a viral receptor is well known, and in the insect Manduca sexta and other insect species, CD13 binds the Cry1A(c) toxin of Bacillus thuringiensis [\n36\n]. Besides, Galectin\u20104 has been reported to act as a ligand for CD13 in the small intestinal brush border epithelia, and as a result of the role of galectins as opsonins [\n37\n, \n38\n], an enticing possibility is that these molecules function as ligands for CD13 in monocytes during phagocytosis. Finally, molecules known to be substrates or inhibitors of CD13 could be regarded as ligands in that they may trigger CD13\u2010mediated signals, which given the extent of CD13 substrates described, would be of great relevance in vivo.",

Fc\u03b3Rs as well as other MIRRs, such as BCR, TCR, and Fc\u025bRI, are mostly excluded from lipid rafts but translocate into them upon clustering [\n44\n, \n45\n, \n46\n, \n47\n, \n48\n]. Furthermore, there are indications that coreceptors influence the residency of MIRRs in rafts [\n49\n]. Preliminary results in our laboratory show colocalization among Fc\u03b3RI, CD13, and ganglioside M1 in the zones of polarization (unpublished results). Thus, it is tempting to suggest that CD13 could modify the affinity of Fc\u03b3Rs for rafts maintaining their residency there for longer periods of time. This could explain the prolongation in the peak level of Syk phosphorylation that we have observed, as Src family kinases responsible for the initial phosphorylation of tyrosines of the immunoreceptor tyrosine\u2010based activation motif reside predominantly in these membrane domains, and Syk itself has been shown to relocate into rafts after Fc\u025bRI aggregation [\n50\n]. Furthermore, the population of CD13 colocalizing with Fc\u03b3RI during phagocytosis could correspond to that associated with rafts, taking into account that a role for lipid rafts has already been demonstrated in phagocytosis [\n51\n].",
