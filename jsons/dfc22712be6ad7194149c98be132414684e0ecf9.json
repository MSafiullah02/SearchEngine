First reports on RNAi emerged in 1998, and since then, it has become one of the most fascinating fields of molecular biology. RNAi has provided important insights about the diversity of RNA molecules and their implication in many biological processes such as the regulation of developmental genes in eukaryotic organisms. Furthermore, RNAi has rapidly developed into a powerful instrument with a great potential for functional genomics and therapeutic applications by silencing normal and disease-related gene functions. To date, the use of RNAi for genetic-based therapies is widely studied, especially in viral infections, cancers, and inherited genetic disorders. Despite the many unanswered questions on how this technology can be efficiently applied to humans, the development of novel approaches, such as vaccines or novel delivery agents, is certainly one of the major goals in RNAi research.",

RNAi is highly selective in mRNA degradation if the exogenously added dsRNA shares sequences of perfect homology with the target. Because the translation of the protein is inhibited by specific degradation of its encoding mRNA, the transcription of the gene remains unaffected. Because dsRNA homologous to intron sequences or promoters comprised by the DNA sequence showed no effect at all, the silencing appears to take place at the posttranscriptional level (1, 5, 6) . Substoichiometric amounts of dsRNA are sufficient to decrease mRNA levels within 2-3 h, and the RNAi phenotype can progress systemically (distribution between different organs) in a variety of organisms (7, 8) . Moreover, cultured cells transfected with dsRNA maintain the loss-of-function phenotype for up to nine cell divisions (9) .",

The trigger for this cellular defense mechanism is dsRNA, which occurs during replication of those elements but never from tightly regulated endogenous genes. Intermediate dsRNA will be recognized and degraded. Moreover, the RNAi machinery is presumed to carry out numerous additional functions. There is evidence that it eliminates defective mRNAs by degradation (14) , as there are genes that function simultaneously in RNAi and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) (15) . RNAi is further assumed to tightly regulate protein levels in response to various environmental stimuli, although the extent to which this mechanism is employed by specific cell types remains to be estimated (16) . This suggests that RNAi is evolutionarily conserved among all eukaryotes occurring in response to the presence of dsRNA.",

They have been shown to be bona fide regulators of gene expression by repressing transcription. Like all RNase III cleavage products, siRNAs and miRNAs bear a 5'-phosphate and a 3'-hydroxyl-group and a two-nucleotide overhang at both 3' ends. These structural features are indispensable for their capacity to exhibit their silencing activity (41) . In accordance with the structure of bacterial RNaseIII, in which two active centers embrace a cleft that can accommodate a dsRNA substrate, Dicer has been proposed to function as an antiparallel dimer (42) . Dicer contains two catalytic domains and it is suggested that in the dimer, only two of the four centers remain active to process the dsRNA into siRNAs of appropriate size (27, 43) .",

So far, Drosophila RISC was first proposed to be an approx 500-kDa complex bound to ribosomes in cell-free extracts (49) . Closer studies identified it as a multifunctional ribonucleotide protein complex (RNP) containing a DEAD-box helicase and a nuclease, which both seem to be conserved in Drosophila, C. elegans, and mammals, although the overlap is not complete (53) . Unwinding of the siRNA mediated by an ATP-dependent helicase converts RISC into its active form RISC*. The antisense siRNA strand remains bound to RISC* and serves as a guiding strand for the recognition of the target mRNA.",

Because of the lack of information about the correct strand orientation, siRNA sense strands may enter the RNAi pathway. Even if the siRNAs are bound by Dicer/R2D2, they are not transferred to RISC in a predetermined orientation. On the other hand, separated antisense and sense strands of a distinct siRNA can reveal similar intrinsic efficacy in targeting their specific mRNA but show different activities when hybridized to a duplex siRNA. The stability of the 5' end determines which strand enters into RISC and which one is released for degradation (55) . Because 5' ends starting with a less stable A-U base-pairing are preferred over those beginning with the more stable G-C, it is suggested that the RISC helicase preferably acts from the less stable 5' end, leading to a preferential incorporation of the respective strand by RISC (55) . This preference is even enhanced by G:U wobble basepairs at the respective 5' end. Statistical analysis of the internal thermodynamic stability of hundreds of synthetic siRNAs has recently confirmed that a decreased stability at the 5' ends of the functional duplexes referring to the antisense strand (55, 56) facilitates the incorporation of the antisense strand into RISC. Thus, sense strands with instable 5' ends might be incorporated by RISC, presumably leading to off-target effects (57) .",

Mutant phenotypes were found in patients with inherited diseases or knockout animals (64) . Today, most gene functions are determined by reverse genetics, which work in the opposite direction. This approach was made possible by huge progress in recombinant DNA technology and the sequencing of a variety of genomes (65, 66) . Reverse genetic studies, sometimes also referred to as functional genomics, meet the challenge of deciphering the steadily accumulating genetic data into functional information. Meanwhile, the genetic information of several organisms has been deciphered, including C. elegans, D. melanogaster, and humans (65, 66) . So far, many methods have been developed to manipulate the expression of genetic information at different levels. Gene silencing at the genomic level mainly proceeds by subjecting the isolated wildtype gene to in vitro mutagenesis by nucleotide substitution, deletion, or insertion. The mutated gene is then placed back into cultured cells or into the organism of interest, where it replaces the functional gene after homologous recombination. This method has been especially exploited to silence genes in animals such as mice and flies. Many practical approaches have been published, including inducible systems that enable the spatial, tissue-specific, and temporal inhibition of gene expression (67) (68) (69) .

The most important experiment that established RNAi as the same powerful tool in mammals has been performed by Tuschl and co-workers (98) , who used synthetic 21-nt duplexes (siRNAs) to trigger the RNAi pathway. They achieved the knocking down of the activity of transfected and endogenous genes without induction of the interferon response. Obviously, the siRNAs, which act as the active intermediate of RNAi, are too short for the activation of PKR. dsRNAs shorter than 21 bp and longer than 25 bp are inefficient in initiating RNAi as well as siRNAs with blunt ends (41) . Only short dsRNAs with a two-nucleotide 3-overhang resembling the naturally active products of Dicer are efficient mediators of RNAi. With this technology, even somatic primary neurons have been successfully treated to produce knock-down RNAi phenotypes (99) .",

MPG is a chimeric protein composed of gp41 (the human immunodeficiency virus [HIV-1] fusion peptide domain) and the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of SV40 large T antigen. Using the MPG bearing a mutation in its NLS prevents nuclear entry and distributes the siRNAs throughout the cytosol (113) .

Many studies have been performed to treat HIV-1, herpes simplex virus, and hepatitis B and C by dsRNAbased approaches. Moreover, the high sensitivity toward point mutations qualifies RNAi as a potential tool for the cure of cancers and inherited diseases. In a study of the Ras oncogene, it was possible to target mutated Ras without affecting unmutated Ras, demonstrating the exquisite specificity of RNAi as a therapeutic tool. However, the same specificity could pose problems for therapeutics against viral infection. Viral escape from RNAi selection in poliovirus by mutation of the target sequence has already been demonstrated. The high specificity is already put into doubt by recent findings that the RNAi mechanism can tolerate some sequence mismatches, particularly away from the middle cleavage site. In fact, a recent in vitro study showed that some genes with incomplete homology could be partially silenced, an effect that was more pronounced at higher concentrations of siRNA.",

It was found that the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) is activated by the intracellular presence of 21-bp siRNAs and triggers the upregulation of IFN and possibly other, cellular signaling molecules. Comparative studies on interferon induction by siRNAs and their shRNA counterparts showed a significantly stronger interferon response after the application of shRNA (149) , so that these side effects need to be studied more closely to settle the current controversy. It has to be kept in mind that almost all plasmid vectors can induce interferon response upon transfection independent of the type of insert they are bearing (150).",

Bitko and Barik were the first to observe specific antiviral effects of siRNA against the respiratory syncytial virus. Shortly after that, the same effects were reported for poliovirus in infected human cells (174) and HIV-1 using siRNAs directed against different regions of the HIV-1 genome, including its long terminal repeat and the genes encoding for the highly conserved genes vif and nef (152) . siRNA-treated cells were particularly immune to subsequent HIV-1 infection in short-term experiments. Novina and co-workers used a contrary approach that notably reduced the ability of the HIV-1 to enter cells by targeting the CD-4 receptor, which is responsible for HIV-1 entry into the host cells. This indicates that the viral infectivity can also be stopped if host genes involved in the viral life cycle are targeted (162) .",

However, this technique requires high pressure and large volumes of siRNA solutions, making it inappropriate for application in humans (142, 143) .

The recent discovery of the DNA or RNA editing roles of prokaryotic PIN domains, which are strikingly numerous in thermophiles and in organisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis now supports the idea that, similar to their eukaryotic counterparts, bacterial PIN domains participate in a related RNA silencing mechanism and nonsense-mediated RNA degradation (198) .

First, RNAi experiments targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1 [IL-1], or tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 [TNF-\u03b1]) successfully reduced the sepsis triggered by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mice (200) .

            "text": "Several in vitro studies have already demonstrated the potential use of RNAi in cancer treatment. Cancer cells usually differ from normal cells by their uncontrolled growth and the ability to escape programmed cell death (apoptosis). For nutrition supply, they assemble a network of blood vessels around tumors, and to evade chemotherapy, they might change surface composition. Therefore, targets for a possible RNAi treatment are genes that are either involved in cell division and proliferation such as growth factors, tumor suppressor genes, transcription factors, and apoptosis inhibitors (106, 171, (202) (203) (204) (205) (206) (207) (208) (209) (210) (211) (212) (213) (214) (215) (216) (217) or proto-oncogenes that take part in many regulatory events and signaling cascades such as Ras and Bcl-2 (208), as well as viral oncogenes, such as from human papilloma virus (HPV). Impaired apoptosis signaling is associated with tumor development and confers resistance to chemotherapy and apoptosis triggered by the death receptor pathway (204) . In many tumors, antiapoptotic proto-oncogenes are overexpressed and inhibition of their expression has potential to facilitate tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis (218) (219) (220) . Multidrug resistance proteins that pump chemotherapeutic drugs out of tumors and factors that stimulate angiogenesis to connect the tumor to nutrition resources are also potential RNAi targets (221) (222) (223) (224) (225) (226) (227) (228) (229) (230) (231) (232) (233) (234) (235) .",

Resistance to chemotherapy, at least in vitro, might also be related to Bcl-2 overexpression. In a comparative study, single siRNAs or combinations of siRNAs were successfully transfected into HeLa cells, lung adenocarcinoma cells, hepatoma cells, ovarian carcinoma cells, and melanoma cells with cationic lipid complexes. Downregulation of other proto-oncogenes and apopotosis inhibitors, such as cdk-2, mdm-2, pkc-alpha, tgf-beta1, h-Ras, and vegf, effectively suppressed the proliferation of cancer cells to different extents, leading to the conclusion that chemically synthesized and vector-driven siRNAs can inhibit the growth and proliferation of cancer cells (219) .",

            "text": "Ras is a powerful regulator of several interconnected receptor-signaling pathways. In its mutated form, it is constitutively active and acts as an oncogene. This process is thought to contribute to malignant transformation in many cell types, which makes elements of this signaling pathway attractive targets for inhibition by RNAi (237) . Previous attempts to silence the Ras oncogene with phosphorothioate oligonucleotides succeeded in stabilizing the disease. Silencing of crucial effectors in Ras signaling like the Raf-c kinase by oligonucleotides shows low to moderate effects in vitro and in an in vivo tumor-xenograft model, whereas treatment with siRNAs can specifically silence expression of oncogenic K-Ras in tumor cells (238, 239) . A tumor suppressor that is often genetically altered is Bcr-Abl. However, targeting the Abl sequence in Bcr-Abl by RNAi might be a therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia. This is only a selection of commonly studied target genes that is supplemented by Table 1 . However, the major drawback for the application in therapy so far remains the issue of delivery. Despite the specific targeting of proto-oncogenes that leaves the expression of the wild-type gene unaltered, many of the other target proteins also play their role in nonproliferating cells and healthy organs. Downregulation of those targets requires methods that allow direct delivery to the tumor without affecting other cells. Those delivery agents need to be tailor-made to each tumor and the different organs from which the tumor is derived. So far, many approaches have been made with either modified dendrimers and liposomes or modified lentiviruses and adenoviruses. To date, no reliable results have been obtained.",

Also, siRNA-mediated gene silencing will be one standard method in the studying of specific roles of proteins in integrated cellular pathways. However, although RNAi has turned out to be an efficient approach to downregulate viral activity in cultured mammalian cells, its application as a therapeutic approach in humans will only be feasible if all risks of unspecific responses and other side effects have been eliminated. This demands a better understanding of the RNAi-related processes, particularly the correlation between structural features of the natural miRNAs and their strictly specific mode of action. This, in turn, will provide a basic reference design of siRNAs to be used for therapeutic purposes. At last, an appropriate system of siRNA delivery in vivo still needs to be developed.",
