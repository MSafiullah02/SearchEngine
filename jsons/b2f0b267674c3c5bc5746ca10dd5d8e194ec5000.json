A number of articles in media and academia have reported COVID-19 pandemic measures have led to an increase in air quality all across the world. New York City has the most confirmed COVID-19 cases in any region the world and, as a result, has been in implementing aggressive stayat-home and social distancing measures since mid-March 2020. We tracked weekly changes in Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), one of the main air pollutants, between February 1, and May 1 2020 close to the Earth's surface using Sentinel-5P satellite data in New York City. Our analysis, that also considers weather conditions and historical NO2 trends, show that many factors have an impact on air quality, there is no clear signal that social distancing is alone responsible for decreases in air quality, and more detailed analysis is urgently needed to provide a better understanding of the correlation between stay-at-home orders and multiple determinants of air quality in New York City.",

            "text": "Millions of people are staying at home as many cities worldwide have taken measures to slow the outbreak of the novel coronavirus . New York City (NYC) has been the hardest hit by COVID-19 spreading and it is now labeled as both the current 'epicenter' and the 'vanguard' of the pandemic (Angel et al., 2020) in the US and worldwide. As a result, on March 7, 2020, Governor Cuomo declared a state of emergency in New York, on March 13, 2020, NYC banned large gatherings, and on March 16, 2020, NYC closed the majority of businesses, restaurants, and schools. The orders to stay at home and practice social distancing have now lasted for several weeks and will possibly be extending from weeks to months. Multiple news reports and articles shared observations showing a decrease in concentrations of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) in the atmosphere as an apparent result of stayat-home and limited human activity. For example, the Daily Mail (Morrison, 2020) , Euro News (Katanich, 2020) , National Geographic Society (Gardiner, 2020) , NYC Department of Health (NYC Government, 2020), and many others published reports on the apparent drastic decline in air pollution in global megacities such as NYC during this period of shelter in place and other COVID-19 social distancing measures. However, though anecdotal observations are compelling, it is unclear whether social distancing and other policies and changes in human behavior associated with the current pandemic are causing declines in air pollution.",

Tropospheric Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) density has been used extensively as a proxy for NOx emissions and their temporal trends (Boersma et al., 2008; Silvern et al., 2019) . We collected and processed the Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) gases data and weather data for NYC weekly for two months between February 1, 2020 and May 1, 2020. We collected the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite data which provides one of the most accurate satellite measurements of NO2. To avoid under/overestimation of NO2, only those NO2 retrievals for clear sky are used in our analysis for which Cloud radiance fraction \u2264 10%. This is an important procedure as clouds can bias measurements by obscuring the sensor's view of the lower atmosphere. Weekly weather data were collected from Phase 2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2). NLDAS-2, which provides hourly weather data, is a collaboration project among several groups in North America including NASA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Princeton University, and the University of Washington. Figure 1 shows the monthly average NO2 in 2019 and the first months of 2020. The figure reveals that NO2 concentrations tend to be lower in the spring and summer than in the fall and winter. This is in line with other studies that have detected similar seasonal patterns in Cabauw (The Netherlands) and Calcutta (India) (Demuzere et al., 2009; Mondal et al., 2000) .",

Although it is normal to see lower NO2 levels in March and April than January and February, there is a notable drop in 2020 compared to 2019. This can be \"partly\" correlated with the COVID-19 lockdown in NYC which began in mid-March due to COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. The annual drop in concentrations of air pollutants including NOx (Figure 2 ) in the USA, that is largely driven by federal and state implementation of air quality regulations (Sullivan et al., 2018) , can easily confuse the relation between potentially cleaner air and the COVID-19 lockdown in NYC.",

            "text": "More importantly, variations in weather conditions are substantial determinants in NO2 and other air pollutants concentrations (Borge et al., 2019) . For example, high wind speed causes the dispersal and dilution of pollutants. Wind can also blow NO2 from areas that have higher NO2 concentrations, e.g., industrial areas, to residential areas causing increased Precipitation and temperature data also reveal inverse relationships with NO2, especially during windy weather conditions. Figure 3 highlights two peaks of NO2 concentration during the weeks started on February 22 (before the lockdown) and April 4 (during the lockdown). Although the peak of April 4 is lower than February 22, the weather conditions were not the same. While the wind speed and precipitation rates were roughly similar during the two weeks, the temperature was significantly higher in the week of April 4. Higher temperatures help accelerate the oxidization of NO2 in the air and, therefore, lower the NO2 concentration (Khoder, 2002) . Stay-at-home and social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic appear to have resulted in a decrease in air pollution over some of the world's most crowded places. However, it remains unclear to what extent these policies and changes in human behavior have contributed to observations of decreased air pollution. Preliminary analyses in NYC support a conclusion that many factors affect the level of air pollution and it remains unclear to what extent observed reductions in air pollution are due to the dramatic changes in behaviors during enforced stay-at-home policies. Improving our understanding of how fundamental transformations of human behavior during the pandemic effects the environment will require more detailed analysis to provide insights and clarifying how stay-at-home policies or similar efforts to reduce the spread of the coronavirus will impact environmental quality such as air pollution in cities.",

Using Sentinel-5P NO2 data and NLDAS-2 weather data, we analyzed relationships between NO2 concentration and other potential drivers of changes in NO2 over time including wind speed, precipitation, and temperature. We found that weather variables may be as or more important to stay-athome policies in explaining changes in NYC NO2 concentrations. Other important weather factors such as relative humidity and barometric pressure, which we did not analyze, may also have an impact on NO2 and should be included in future research. Additionally, chemical interactions between different air pollutants including NO2, Particulate Matter 2.5 microns, Sulfur Dioxide, and Carbon Monoxide would help to understand the likely multiple drivers of observations of decreased urban air pollution during the COVID-19 pandemic.
