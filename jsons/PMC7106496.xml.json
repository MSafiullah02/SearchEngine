These specimens were tested for influenza virus (IFV) by rRT-PCR, and 52.4% IFV negative specimens were sent for cell-based culture isolation. Of these, 324 produced CPE but were negative for common respiratory virus serology tests suggesting the presence of uncommon respiratory viruses in the culture. We sought to determine if we could identify a pathogen in CPE positive samples despite the samples testing negative using antibody panels for common respiratory samples. The information obtained will be used to improve current molecular detection protocols, which can then be incorporated in routine surveillance and clinical diagnosis.",

Nine samples from Thailand 2010\u20132011 were sequenced individually and confirmed the present of the identical enterovirus serotypes sequences [22]. Despite the spread of EV-D68 globally [26], it was not detected in our surveillance study which enrolled adults 18\u201365 ages group during 2010\u20132013. Our study, with limited sample size detected a similar range of enterovirus serotypes (CV B2, CV B3, CV B4, E6 and E9) in SE Asian countries as other recent studies in Thailand [21], [22]. These serotypes identified outside Thailand strains have genetic distance <0.2 from the Thai serotypes. This suggests some temporal and spatial structure of both the Thai and, more broadly, the SE Asian EV populations, and thus may indicate some regional circulation of EV lineages and viral traffic between countries in SE Asia.",

However, the identification of pathogens in the samples that yielded low sequence reads requires additional testing and controls. Our data (Table 1A, Table 1B) showed total sequence reads without subtracting background sequence of the negative control experiment. The low sequence reads in several samples were likely generated from combination of cross talk among neighboring sequenced samples, contamination of barcodes and carries over from the previous runs. A specific example such as the Philippines 2012 pool contained sequence reads that were identical to Philippines 2011- 2012 pool, which was performed next to each other during library preparation. In addition, three pools detected only host background and not viral pathogens possibly due to low viral load, no viruses growing in the culture, or misidentifying the morphology of culture identified as CPE positive.",

With the addition of WG-NGS, 29 of 32 (90.6%) pools were shown to contain viral pathogens identifiable using the GENBANK nt database. When broken down into individual samples, we were able to confirm the presence of other respiratory viruses in 100 of the 310 (32.3%) individual samples. WG-NGS significantly increased valid data information in addition to the standard respiratory assays. Furthermore, the WG-NGS and bioinformatics analysis were able to identify viral pathogens from pooled cultures containing up to 26 samples, which potentially makes this method time, labor and cost effective. This procedure allows screening of larger numbers of samples, with practical applications to surveillance or clinical studies.",

Mainly pooled CPE positive cultures were tested as opposed to individually sequencing primary specimens. Without taking into consideration samples where HSV-1 was detected, approximately 67.8% of the samples in the pooled remained of unknown etiology after WG-NGS and bioinformatics data analysis (Fig. 4). A potential and likely significant limitation in this work was the cell lines selected for virus isolation. Our limitation to our two cell lines may have curtailed the type of viruses we were able to isolate and identify. Moreover, antibiotics required to maintain the MDCK and HEp-2 cultures may have also favored the growth of certain viruses over others.",

Long sequence reads with high depth of coverage (DOC) are optimal to identify diverse types of viruses from various types of clinical specimens [29], [30], [31], [32].
