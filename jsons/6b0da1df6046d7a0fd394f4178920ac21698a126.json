Furthermore, reports of transmission amongst minimally symptomatic or pre-symptomatic patients 2,3 explains, in part, why COVID-19 is far more challenging to contain. Acute kidney injury (AKI) and need for kidney replacement therapy (KRT) have also been reported 4 and delivering KRT in critically ill COVID-19 patients poses unique challenges. Overall, it must be recognized that dialysis patients are a highly susceptible population and that HD centers are a high risk area, and therefore, additional measures must be undertaken to mitigate the risk to dialysis patients in this pandemic.",

The nurse dons full PPE and ensures all relevant equipment needed is available before entering the room to perform dialysis. An estimated additional 30 minutes is required for each session of dialysis, compared to regular dialysis at our dialysis unit. During the dialysis, reducing movement in and out of the isolation room is also crucial to minimize contamination. As far as possible, heparin-free dialysis is avoided to reduce the need for frequent circuit flushing. Use of real-time remote vital sign monitoring (blood pressure, heart rate and pulse oximetry) via ViSi Mobile (Sotera Wireless, San Diego, California, USA) and electronic transmission of data reduces the need to enter the patient's room. Disposable test strips (instead of a photometer) are utilized for chlorine and chloramine testing, avoiding possible additional equipment contamination. Documentation of dialysis flow sheets is also strictly performed outside the isolation room. Each dialysis machine is dedicated to an individual patient and remains in the patient's room till de-isolation or discharge to minimize equipment movement between patients. Upon discharge or de-isolation of the patient, the dialysis machines are thoroughly wiped down with 70% ethyl alcohol wipes before use for the next patient.",

Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) can usually be safely interchanged for patients in the hospital, with appropriate adjustments of PD prescription, namely fluid tonicity and dwell time. In the context of an outbreak, APD provides the advantage of minimizing nursing contact with patients as only two nurse-patient encounters are necessary at the start and end of therapy, as compared to an average of four exchanges daily in CAPD. However, APD machine alarms may require urgent attention to troubleshoot and may also increase the frequency and duration of nurse-patient contact. Moreover, the use of APD necessitates the need to push additional equipment into the isolation room. Given these considerations, CAPD is the initial PD modality of choice in our center. Besides PD modality and prescription, adjustments to performing PD exchanges in full PPE are required. However, this adds to the time required to perform PD and should be factored in when planning nursing staffing requirements.",

Insertion of temporary dialysis catheters with full PPE is more challenging and is performed by an experienced operator using ultrasound guidance. The use of disposable instrument sets for procedures reduces the need for subsequent sterilization and risk of contamination. In general, the choice of dialysis catheter placement via internal jugular (IJ) or femoral approach is dependent on factors such as risk of infection, complications and operators' preference. However, critically ill COVID-19 patients often have severe acute respiratory distress syndrome with high ventilator requirements and may require prone positioning. In the prone position, the IJ approach may provide better ease of nursing care, although successful CRRT using a femoral catheter has also been described. 13 Critically ill COVID-19 patients requiring CRRT are assigned a dedicated CRRT machine for his/her duration of ICU stay requiring KRT and we avoid the need to share machines between patients to prevent contamination. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy is also used in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and the medical team should be familiar with CRRT incorporation with the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit. 14 Regional citrate anticoagulation is preferred as it extends filter life and prevents circuit clotting, interruption to dialysis and blood loss. Our current protocol starts with a higher initial calcium replacement that maintains a more stable serum ionized calcium level and therefore minimizes the frequency of blood sampling or adjustment.",

The Infectious Diseases Act mandates the notification of all COVID-19 infection, and contact tracing teams actively identify close contacts of patients infected with COVID-19. These asymptomatic close contacts of COVID-19 patients are quarantined at home or government quarantine facilities, which include repurposed hotels and chalets where patients may be isolated if their home is not suitable for home quarantine, through a national coordinated effort. Healthcare in Singapore remains generally affordable, with relatively low out-ofpocket payment, via a co-payment model of basic universal health insurance (Medishield Life), optional private insurance add-on, compulsory national medical savings scheme (Medisave) and endowment fund (Medifund) for patients who need additional support. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, the hospitalization costs of residents with COVID-19 infection admitted to public hospitals in Singapore are further fully borne by the government. Dialysis support provided by our center includes the provision of outpatient HD and peritoneal dialysis (PD) for persons under quarantine, routine HD and PD for hospitalized suspect or confirmed cases and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). The key considerations in planning dialysis services are to ensure adequate resources for the provision of uninterrupted KRT for ESKD patients, while minimizing risk of transmission of COVID-19 between individual patients, the community and healthcare workers. Cross-infection amongst patients is mitigated with individual isolation rooms for hospitalized confirmed and suspect cases, while segregating patients who are close contacts of a confirmed case during the incubation period from other patients in the community. Equipment disinfection is essential to prevent potential iatrogenic COVID-19 transmission. The stability of SARS-coronavirus-2 is demonstratedto be similar to SARS-coronavirus-1, and can be detected on surfaces for up to 72 hours.6",

During the period of quarantine (14 days from date of last close contact), persons under quarantine are suspended from continuing dialysis at their usual center, and are transferred with an escort from their home to the national designated dialysis center (Figure 1). Most community dialysis centers have further assigned a fixed shift and fixed dialysis chair seating for each individual patient, to limit contact between different individuals and to facilitate contact tracing, should the need arise. Together with the local health authority, the hospital designates a dialysis center as the national home quarantine dialysis center, in which all persons under quarantine are dialyzed on the last shift (separated from the other non-quarantine patients) with a dedicated nursing team. This minimizes any contact that the quarantined patient may have had with other dialysis patients, dialysis center staff or the general public. Staff and escorts attend to these patients in appropriate PPE. Prior to patients entering the center, screening is performed to ensure they do not have fever or respiratory symptoms before proceeding for dialysis. Thorough disinfection of the dialysis facility is conducted after each shift of patients. Patients are admitted for evaluation if they develop symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. This continues until the end of the quarantine period of 14 days, when they then return to their originating dialysis center. We do not routinely test persons under quarantine for COVID-19 if the patient is asymptomatic. To prevent transmission in the susceptible dialysis population, mask wearing was mandated during outpatient hemodialysis, as part of a national strategy to reduce community transmission of COVID-19. Challenges encountered include the need to respond to and create capacity to manage sudden surge in cases, the recruitment of dedicated staff to manage such patients, and the high turnover of patients encountered with different medical and functional needs. A secondary site to cater to surge demand has been designated. As of 23 rd April 2020, we have provided support to 39 dialysis patients under quarantine period, and none have tested positive for COVID-19 so far.",
