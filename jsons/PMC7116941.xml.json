Previous studies reported that viruses can exist in the air of hospital rooms [7], [8] and also in human breath [9], [10]. Moreover, large scale outbreaks of SARS were caused via airborne exposure routes [11], [12]. An airborne infection which occurs by transportation of virus-laden aerosols plays an important role in disease dispersion, thus, development of efficient air control technology is important in combating inhalation-related diseases. Antimicrobial agent treatment is a possible solution to prevent airborne infection. Therefore, the synthesis of various antimicrobial agents and their applications for air purification have been studied.",

Moreover, it is reported that silver nanoparticles have high binding affinity for the hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA and extracellular virions with different sized Ag nanoparticles, and can inhibit the production of HBV RNA and extracellular virions [32]. It is generally understood that Ag ions and Ag nanoparticles inactivate viruses by denaturing enzymes by reactions with sulfhydra, amino, carboxyl, phosphate, and imidazole groups [33], [34], [35], [36], [37].",

A following study presented a large scale fabrication of monodisperse silica hybrid particles (without magnetic core) decorated with Ag nanoparticles and their prompt antibacterial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria on air filtration [27]. In those studies, the silica hybrid particles, whether they contained a magnetic Fe3O4 core or not, were functionalized with aminopropyl (AP) groups and the AP groups were used as a dispersive supporter for aggregation control in an aqueous solution and also, as a post to decorate Ag nanoparticles. Oxidation of the decorated Ag nanoparticles was negligibly minimal and their integral hybrid structure was conserved even after 8 months, as far as their concentration had been kept higher than 1.3% in aqueous media. Moreover, surface-oxidized Ag nanoparticles on silica still exhibited a promising antibacterial activity both in water and air [27].",

The method of fabricating an anti-viral air filter is shown in Fig. 1a. After 2 lpm of compressed air which was controlled by a mass flow meter (MFM, 4140, TSI Inc., USA) passed through a clean air supply system consisting of an oil-trap, diffusion dryer, and high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, the air entered a Collison-type atomizer (9302, TSI Inc., USA) which was filled with 50 mL of SA particle solution. The aerosolized nanoparticles were carried in a flow and coated on the glass fiber medium air filter. The particle concentrations upstream (C\nin) and downstream (C\nout) from the filter sample were measured by a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS, TSI Inc., USA) which consisted of a classifier controller (3080, TSI Inc., USA), a differential mobility analyzer (DMA, 3081, TSI Inc., USA), a condensation particle counter (CPC, 3022A, TSI Inc., USA), and an aerosol charge neutralizer (Soft X-ray charger 4530, HCT Co., Ltd., Korea).

The filter with an areal density of 1.2 \u00d7 109\n #/cm2 had solidity of about 0.01, while the solidity of the pristine filter (\u03b1\u2032) was 0.009. The increment of solidity (\u03b1\nparticle\n = 0.001) was enough to disturb the flow inside the filter and change the pressure drop. Theoretical values predicted by Eq. (10) were consistent with the experimental tendency. Moreover, an experiment was carried out using 0.5 m/s of clean air to investigate whether coated SA particles could be detached from the filter. The concentration downstream from the fabricated filter was measured by the CPC, and the results show that no SA particles were detached from any fabricated filter samples.",

Filtration efficiencies of fabricated air filters for various coating areal densities and media velocities are shown in Fig. 6\n. The filtration efficiency increased with decreasing media velocity for a given coating areal density. It is well known that the filtration mechanism for nanoparticles at the tens-of-nanometer scale is dominated by diffusional motion of the particles. It is well known that the filtration efficiency due to Brownian diffusion increases with decreasing media velocity for a given particle size [47]. The experimental results shown in Fig. 6 follow this tendency. Moreover, Fig. 6 shows that the filtration efficiency increased with increasing coating areal density for a given media velocity. In previous research, the filtration efficiency of a particle-loaded filter was suggested as follows [48],(15)\u03b7filt=1\u2212P0exp[\u2212\u03b2\u03c1areal]where P\n0 is the penetration of the particle unloaded filter, depending on the media velocity. \u03b2 is a constant representing filter performance, which depends on the filter material.

The first issue is about the ratio of the number of virus particles deposited on the filter to the SA particles in the filter. As shown in Fig. 7, the overall anti-viral efficiency was strongly influenced by the amount of SA particles coated in a filter. Note that each data point was determined with Eq. (13) and plaque counting was performed for a filter after the filter was continuously deposited by the aerosolized virus particles for 30 min. However, for virus deposition times other than 30 min, different antiviral efficiencies would be obtained. If the deposition time increases, the ratio of the number of virus particles to SA particles will increase, implying that the amount of SA particles would not be enough for antiviral action against the virus particles. The second issue is about the fact that the filtration efficiency increased with the coating areal density. As shown in Fig. 6, the filtration efficiency was a function of coating areal density, thus, the amount of deposited virus particles increased with coating areal density for a given virus deposition time.",

The best filter is the one that gives the highest collection efficiency with the least pressure drop. However, increasing collection efficiency necessarily accompanies increasing of pressure drop. Since pressure drop is related to energy expenditure in filtration, the quotient of the logarithm of the penetration and the pressure drop is a measure of the performance achieved against the energy expended. This quotient is called the quality factor. Therefore, the quality factor is used as a useful criterion for comparing different filters of different thickness. In this study, in order to compare the performances of various anti-viral air filters, three different filter quality factors were evaluated: filtration quality factor (q\nfilt), overall anti-viral quality factor (q\u00afantiviral), and time-dependent anti-viral quality factor (q\nantiviral), which were defined as follows,(22)qfilt=ln(1/1\u2212\u03b7filt)\u0394P\n(23)q\u00afantiviral=ln(1/(1\u2212\u03b7\u00afantiviral))\u0394P\n(24)qantiviral(t)=ln(1/1\u2212\u03b7antiviral(t))\u0394P\n",

However, coating areal density did not lead to significant changes in the filtration quality factor, since both filtration efficiency (\u03b7\nfilt) and pressure drop increased with increasing coating areal density. The overall anti-viral quality factor (q\u00afantiviral) also decreased with increasing media velocity (Fig. 9b). With increasing of coating areal density, q\u00afantiviral increased for a given media velocity until the efficiency reached its maximum value (99.9%), but gradually decreased, since the pressure drop continuously increased while the anti-viral efficiency (\u03b7\u00afantiviral) was maintained at a maximum. For a given coating areal density, the time-dependent anti-viral quality factor (q\nantiviral(t)) approached an infinite value due to \u03b7\nantiviral(0) \u2248 1 when the virus deposition time was close to zero and exponentally decreased with increasing virus deposition time (Fig. 9c). Moreover, with a higher coating areal density, q\nantiviral(t) gradually decreased. By comparing these quality factors, it can be concluded that coating SA particles on a filter does not lead to a significant effect on the filtration quality, and there is an optimal coating areal density to obtain the highest anti-viral quality. These factors can be used as a criterion for determining the effective coating level for an anti-viral agent.",
