The coronavirus spike glycoprotein is a key determinant of host specificity, and elucidating the mechanisms of viral host expansion is important to understand the molecular events that rendered the virus pathogenic to humans. Sequences of viral spikes from early human clinical cases resembled those isolated from civet cats (SZ16) in wild animal markets early in the epidemic. 1 The spike sequence from a human clinical isolate from the Guangdong region late in 2003 (GD03) differs from SARS Urbani in 16 residues almost all of which reside in the S1 domain and five of which reside in the putative receptor binding domain. 2 Using data from DNA sequence databases and synthetic biology, we have resurrected the extinct spike glycoprotein gene of GD03 within our SARS Urbani infectious clone. Growth of the GD03 spike/Urbani chimeric recombinant virus (icGD03) in Vero cells is not as robust as icSARS or Urbani suggesting that the GD03 spike does not bind Vero ACE2 with the same affinity. In vivo growth of icGD03 and icSARS was compared in Balb/c via intranasal infection. The icGD03 lung titer at all time points was not as robust as icSARS-CoV suggesting that the GD03 spike slightly impairs growth in mice.",
