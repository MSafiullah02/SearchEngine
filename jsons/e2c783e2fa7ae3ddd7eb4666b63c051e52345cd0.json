The high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, combined with a lack of population immunity and prevalence of severe clinical outcomes, urges the rapid development of effective therapeutic countermeasures. Here, we report the generation of synthetic nanobodies, known as sybodies, against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. In an expeditious process taking only twelve working days, sybodies were selected entirely in vitro from three large combinatorial libraries, using ribosome and phage display. We obtained six strongly enriched sybody pools against the isolated RBD and identified 63 unique anti-RBD sybodies which also interact in the context of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain. Among the selected sybodies, six were found to bind to the viral spike with double-digit nanomolar affinity, and five of these also showed substantial inhibition of RBD interaction with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Additionally, we identified a pair of anti-RBD sybodies that can simultaneously bind to the RBD. It is anticipated that compact binders such as these sybodies could feasibly be developed into an inhalable drug that can be used as a convenient prophylaxis against COVID-19. Moreover, generation of polyvalent antivirals, via fusion of anti-RBD sybodies to additional small binders recognizing secondary epitopes, could enhance the therapeutic potential and guard against escape mutants. We present full sequence information and detailed protocols for the identified sybodies, as a freely accessible resource.",

Several factors contribute to the adverse nature of SARS-CoV-2 from a global health perspective, including the absence of herd immunity [1] , high transmissibility [2, 3] , the prospect of asymptomatic carriers [4] , and a high rate of clinically severe outcomes [5] . Moreover, a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to be available for at least 12-18 months [6] , despite earnest development efforts [7, 8] , making alternative intervention strategies paramount. In addition to offering relief for patients suffering from the resulting COVID-19 disease, therapeutics may also reduce the viral transmission rate by being administered to asymptomatic individuals subsequent to probable exposure [9] . Finally, given that SARS-CoV-2 represents the third global coronavirus outbreak in the past 20 years [10, 11] , development of rapid therapeutic strategies during the current crises could offer greater preparedness for future pandemics.",

The spike ectodomain is segregated into two regions, termed S1 and S2. The outer S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for host recognition via interaction between its C-terminal receptor-binding domain (RBD) and human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), present on the exterior surface of airway cells [14, 15] . While there is no known host-recognition role for the S1 N-terminal domain (NTD) of SARS-CoV-2, it is notable that S1 NTDs of other coronaviruses have been shown to bind host surface glycans [12, 16] . In contrast to spike region S1, the S2 subunit contains the membrane fusion apparatus, and also mediates trimerization of the ectodomain [12] [13] [14] . Prior to host recognition, spike proteins exist in a metastable pre-fusion state wherein the S1 subunits lay atop the S2 region and the RBD oscillates between \"up\" and \"down\" conformations that are, respectively, accessible and inaccessible to receptor binding [12, 17, 18] . Upon processing at the S1/S2 and S2' cleavage sites by host proteases as well as engagement to the receptor, the S2 subunit undergoes dramatic conformational changes from the pre-fusion to the post-fusion state. Such structural rearrangements are associated with the merging of the viral envelope with host membranes, thereby allowing injection of the genetic information into the cytoplasm of the host cell [19, 20] .",

However, binders against the isolated RBD may not effectively engage the aforementioned pre-fusion conformation of the full spike, which could account for the poor neutralization ability of recently described single-domain antibodies that were raised against the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 [30] . Therefore, to better identify molecules with qualities befitting a drug-like candidate, it would be advantageous to validate RBD-specific binders in the context of the full, stabilized, pre-fusion spike assembly [13, 31] .",

Nanobodies are small (12) (13) (14) (15) , stable, and inexpensive to produce in bacteria and yeast [33] , yet they bind targets in a similar affinity range as conventional antibodies. Due to their minimal size, they are particularly suited to reach hidden epitopes such as crevices of target proteins [34] . We recently designed three libraries of synthetic nanobodies, termed sybodies, based on elucidated structures of nanobody-target complexes (Fig. 1A) [35, 36] . Sybodies can be selected against any target protein within twelve working days, which is considerably faster than natural nanobodies, which requires the repetitive immunization during a period of two months prior to binder selection by phage display [36] (Fig. 1C) . A considerable advantage of our platform is that sybody selections are carried out under defined conditions -in case of coronavirus spike proteins, this offers the opportunity to generate binders recognizing the metastable pre-fusion conformation [13, 14] . Finally, due to the feasibility of inhaled therapeutic nanobody formulations [37], virusneutralizing sybodies could offer a convenient and direct means of prophylaxis.",

Six unique sybodies show favorable binding affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike, and five of these were also found to substantially attenuate the interaction between the viral RBD and human ACE2. Moreover, pairs of sybodies were identified that can simultaneously bind to the RBD. We present all sequences for these clones, along with detailed protocols to enable the community to freely produce and further characterize these SARS-CoV-2 binders.",

This construct was expressed and secreted from Expi293 cells, and RBD-vYFP was extracted directly from culture medium supernatant using an immobilized anti-GFP nanobody [39], affording a highly purified product with negligible background contamination. Initial efforts to cleave the C-terminal vYFP fusion partner with 3C protease resulted in unstable RBD, so experiments were continued with full RBD-vYFP fusion protein. To account for the presence of the vYFP fusion partner, a second RBD construct, consisting of a fusion to murine IgG1 Fc domain (RBD-Fc), was commercially acquired. To remove any trace amines, buffers were exchanged to PBS via extensive dialysis. Proteins were chemically biotinylated, and the degree of biotinylation was assessed by a streptavidin gel-shift assay and found to be greater than 90 % of the target proteins [40] . We note that while both RBD fusion proteins were well-behaved, a commercially acquired purified full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain construct (ECD) was found to be aggregation-prone. Very recently, we also produced an engineered spike protein ectodomain containing two point mutations known to stabilize the pre-fusion state, an inactivated furin cleavage site, and a C-terminal trimerization motif [13, 14, 31] . While this purified pre-fusion spike (PFS) had not yet been available for binder selections and characterization by grating-coupled interferometry, it was used to conduct ELISAs in order to identify selected sybodies which recognize the RBD in the pre-fusion context (see below).",

Hence, selections with the three sybody libraries (concave, loop and convex) were started with the RBD-vYFP construct using ribosome display, and the RBD-Fc construct was then used for the two phage display rounds (selection variant 1: RBD-vYFP/RBD-Fc/RBD-Fc) and vice versa (selection variant 2: RBD-Fc/RBD-vYFP/RBD-vYFP). Accordingly, there were a total of six selection reactions (Table 1 , Fig. 1B) . To increase the average affinity of the isolated sybodies, we included an off-rate selection step using the preenriched purified sybody pool after phage display round 1 as competitor. To this end, sybody pools of all three libraries of the same selection variant were sub-cloned from the phage display vectors into the sybody expression vector pSb_init. Subsequently, the two separate pools (all sybodies of selection variants 1 and 2, respectively) were expressed and purified. The purified pools were then added to the panning reactions of the respective selection variant in the second phage display round. Thereby, rebinding of sybody-phage complexes with fast off-rates was suppressed. Enrichment of sybodies against the RBD was monitored by qPCR. Already in the first phage display round, the concave and loop sybodies of selection variant 2 showed enrichment factors of 7 and 3, respectively (Table 1) . After the second phage display round (which included the off-rate selections step), strong enrichment factors in the range of 10-263 were determined.",

Our standard ELISA was initially performed using RBD-vYFP (RBD), spike ectodomain containing S1 and S2 (ECD), and maltose binding protein (MBP) as unrelated dummy protein. As outlined in the Materials and Methods section, ELISA analysis revealed very high hit rates for the RBD and the ECD ranging from 81 % to 100 % and 66 % to 96 %, respectively (Fig. 2 , Table 1 ). The majority of the sybodies giving an ELISA signal to the RBD also gave a clear signal the full-length spike protein (Fig. 2 ). However, there was a total of 44 hits that only gave an ELISA signal for RBD-vYFP, but not for the ECD. This could be due to the presence of cryptic RBD epitopes that are not accessible in the context of the full-length spike protein, or the respective sybodies may recognize the vYFP portion of the RBD-vYFP construct, though the selection procedure clearly disfavors the latter explanation. Importantly, background binding to the dummy protein MBP was not observed for any of the analyzed sybodies, clearly showing that the binders are highly specific. We then sequenced 72 sybodies that were ELISA-positive against RBD-vYFP as well as the full-length spike (12 for each of the 6 selection reactions numbered from Sb#1-72, see also Fig. 1B ).",

Overall, the ELISA signals for the ECD and PFS are highly similar. However, there are around 40 sybodies that bind to the ECD clearly stronger than to the PFS (yet the opposite scenario was never observed). This could be explained by the fact that the PFS forms a trimer, while the oligomeric state of the ECD is not clear. In addition, the ECD might adopt partially or completely a post-fusion state, whereas PFS is expected to predominantly adopt the pre-fusion state. Trimer formation as well as pre-fusion stabilization might shield certain binding epitopes on the RBD in the context of the PFS, which might become accessible as the spike falls apart into monomers and/or transits to the post-fusion state. In light of our ELISA data, the PFS construct will be a crucial element in any future sybody selection campaigns.",

Ultimately, 57 sybodies were sufficiently well-behaved, with respect to solubility, yield, and monodispersity, to proceed with further characterization. For a kinetic analysis of sybody interactions with the viral spike, we employed grating-coupled interferometry (GCI) to probe sybody binding to immobilized RBD-vYFP or ECD. First, the 57 purified sybodies were subjected to an off-rate screen, which revealed six sybodies (Sb#14, Sb#15, Sb#16, Sb#42, Sb#45, and Sb#68) with strong binding signals and comparatively slow off-rates. Binding constants were then determined by measuring on-and off-rates over a range of sybody concentrations, revealing affinities within a range of 20-180 nM to the SARS-CoV-2 spike (Fig. 7 , Table 3 ). Of note, binding affinities were consistently equal or higher for the ECD as compared to the RBD-vYFP, in particular in case of Sb#68 for which the off-rate differs by more than two-fold. This might indicate a binding avidity effect arising from binding epitopes clustering in the context of the spike trimer or differences with regards to the glycan structures (RBD-vYFP was produced in HEK cells, whereas the ECD was produced in insect cells). To our surprise, the majority of purified and ELISA-positive sybodies (51 out of 57) displayed binding affinities worse than 200 nM. This may be attributed to the presence of complex heterogeneous Asnlinked glycans within the RBD, which could hinder the isolation of specific high-affinity binders. Alternatively, given that the final ELISA step of the selection process resulted in a substantial number of positive clones, insufficiently stringent conditions may have favored the high positive hit rate of lowaffinity binders.",

For this assessment, ELISA plates were coated with purified hACE2, and the binding of purified RBD to the 6 immobilized hACE2 was measured in the presence or absence of an excess of each purified sybody (Fig. 8 ). While the absence of any added sybody resulted in a strong ELISA signal corresponding to RBD association with hACE2, the pre-incubation of nearly all sybodies with the RBD resulted in an attenuated signal, implying that these binders inhibit RBD-hACE2 association. This signal decrease relative to unchallenged RBD was modest for most sybodies, with an average signal reduction of about 50%, but five sybodies demonstrated exceptionally high apparent inhibition of RBD-hACE2 interaction (Sb#14, Sb#15, Sb#16, Sb#42, and Sb#45), showing \u226590% signal reduction. Notably, the aforementioned kinetic analysis had shown that these sybodies were also among the strongest RBD binders.

Therefore, it was hypothesized that Sb#68 may interact with a non-or partially-overlapping surface on the RBD, relative to the more strongly-inhibiting sybodies. Using Sb#15 as a representative of the hACE2-inhibiting sybodies, we analyzed the ability of Sb#15 and Sb#68 to simultaneously associate with the RBD. First, ELISA experiments demonstrate that incubation of Sb#68 with the pre-fusion spike only slightly prevents the spike from binding to immobilized Sb#15, whereas pre-incubation with Sb#14, Sb#15, Sb#16, Sb#42, or Sb#45 completely prevents spike interaction with immobilized Sb#15 (Fig. 9 ). In agreement with the ELISA data, GCI experiments revealed that co-injection of Sb#15 and Sb#68 results in a clear (but not fully additive) increase of the response signal, relative to Sb#15 or Sb#68 injected alone, implying simultaneous binding of Sb#15 and Sb#68 (Fig. 9 ). The control GCI experiment involving the co-injection of Sb#15 and Sb#45 did not result in a similar signal increase ( Fig. 9 ). In sum, this data plausibly suggests that Sb#15 and Sb#68 can simultaneously bind to the RBD.

Cells were pelleted (500g, 10 min), and culture supernatant was filtered (0.2 \u00b5m mesh size) before being passed three times over a gravity column containing NHSagarose beads covalently coupled to the anti-GFP nanobody 3K1K [39], at a resin:culture ratio of 1ml resin per 100ml expression culture. Resin was washed with 20 column-volumes of RBD buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, supplemented with additional 0.2M NaCl), and RBD-vYFP was eluted with 0.1 M glycine, pH 2.5, via sequential 0.5 ml fractions, without prolonged incubation of resin with the acidic elution buffer. Fractionation tubes were pre-filled with 1/10 vol 1M Tris, pH 9.0 (50 \u00b5l), such that elution fractions were immediately pH-neutralized. Fractions containing RBD-vYFP were pooled, concentrated, and stored at 4\u00b0C. Purity was estimated to be >95%, based on SDS-PAGE (not shown). Yield of RBD-vYFP was approximately 200-300 \u03bcg per 100 ml expression culture. A second purified RBD construct, consisting of SARS-CoV-2 residues Arg319-Phe541 fused to a murine IgG1 Fc domain (RBD-Fc) expressed in HEK293 cells, was purchased from Sino Biological (Catalogue number: 40592-V05H, 300 \u00b5g were ordered).

The prefusion ectodomain of the SARS-CoV2 Spike protein (residues 1-1208) [13] , was transiently transfected into 50x10 8 suspension-adapted ExpiCHO cells (Thermo Fisher) using 3 mg plasmid DNA and 15 mg of PEI MAX (Polysciences) per 1L ProCHO5 medium (Lonza) in a 3L Erlenmeyer flask (Corning) in an incubator shaker (K\u00fchner). One hour post-transfection, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; AppliChem) was added to 2% (v/v). Incubation with agitation was continued at 31\u00b0C for 5 days. 1L of filtered (0.22 um) cell culture supernatant was clarified. Then, a 1mL Gravity flow Strep-Tactin\u00aeXT Superflow\u00ae column (iba lifescience) was rinsed with 2 ml buffer W (100 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) using gravity flow. The supernatant was added to the column, which was then rinsed with 5 ml of buffer W (all with gravity flow). Finally, six elution steps were performed by adding each time 0.5 ml of buffer BXT (50mM Biotin in buffer W) to the resin. All purification steps were performed at 4\u00b0C.",

During these processes (first dialysis/ concentrating/ biotinylation/ second dialysis), 20 %, 30 %, 65 % and 44% of the RBD-vYFP, RBD-Fc, ECD and PFS respectively were lost due to sticking to the concentrator filter or due to aggregation.

In short, one round of ribosome display followed by two rounds of phage display were carried out. Binders were selected against two different constructs of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD; an RBD-vYFP fusion and an RBD-Fc fusion. MBP was used as background control to determine the enrichment score by qPCR [36] . In order to avoid enrichment of binders against the fusion proteins (YFP and Fc), we switched the two targets after ribosome display (Fig. 1B) . For the offrate selections we did not use non-biotinylated target proteins as described in the standard protocol, because we did not have enough purified protein at hand to do so. Instead we sub-cloned all three libraries for both selections after the first round of phage display into the pSb_init vector (10 8 clones) and expressed the six pools in E. coli MC1061 cells. Then the pools corresponding to the same selection were pooled for purification. The two final pools were purified by Ni-NTA resin using gravity flow columns, followed by buffer exchange of the main peak fraction using a desalting PD10 column in TBS pH 7.5 to remove imidazole. The pools were eluted with 3.2 ml instead of 3.5 ml TBS pH 7.5 in order to ensure complete buffer exchange. These two purified pools were used for the off-rate selection in the second round of phage display at concentrations of approximately 390 \u00b5M for selection variant 1 (RBP-Fc) and 450 \u00b5M for selection variant 2 (RBP-YFP). The volume used for off-rate selection was 500 \u00b5l. Just before the pools were used for the off-rate selection, 0.5% BSA and 0.05% Tween-20 was added to each sample. Off-rate selections were performed for 3 minutes.",

Sybodies were injected for 120 s at a flow rate of 30 \u03bcl/min per channel and dissociation was set to 600 s to allow the return to baseline. Sensorgrams were recorded at 25 \u00b0C and the data analyzed on the WAVEcontrol (Creoptix AG).
