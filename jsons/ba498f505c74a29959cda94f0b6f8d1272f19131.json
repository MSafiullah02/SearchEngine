            "text": ". In our study, hMPV infection was independently 235 associated with the occurrence of acute heart failure. 236Several limitations should be acknowledged. First, we enrolled patients during influenza virus 237 circulation whereas hMPV circulation does not always match that of influenza.Second, we  238    had no data to support causality between the detection of hMPV in nasopharyngeal samples 239 and the ILI hospital admission. Other pathogens such as respiratory bacteria may have been 240 involved and hMPV may been a concomitant infectious agent with no role in the symptoms 241reported. The absence of data on bacteriological results prevents us from addressing this 242 issue. Finally, although asymptomatic carriage of hMPV appears to be uncommon [26], we 243 had no control population (i.e. hospitalized adults without ILI symptoms) to help evaluate 244In conclusion, adult hMPV infections concerned 3% of patients hospitalized with ILI in tertiary246 care hospitals over six consecutive influenza seasons in France. Most of the patients were 247 older, had associated chronic conditions and developed pulmonary and cardiac 248 complications. The relation between hMPV infection and worsening of heart failure needs 249 further investigation. These at-risk populations would benefit from the development of 250 antivirals and vaccines targeting hMPV. 251Transparency declarationThe authors declare no competing interest related to the study.
