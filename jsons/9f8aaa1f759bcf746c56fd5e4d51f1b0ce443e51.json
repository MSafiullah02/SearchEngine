An innocuous virus mostly, it can cause life-threatening pneumonia in the immunocompromised. Standard cell culture techniques can take up to 3 weeks for positive isolation, although this can speeded up by immunofluorescent or enzymatic detection of early antigens in 24-48 h. PCR can effect a diagnosis in less than 24 h. The extreme sensitivity of PCR is useful if the clinical features are suggestive, but if these are ambiguous may cause confusion. Positive results may occur because of latent virus, which is common in adults. The likeliest benefit will come from examining material from neonates and clinical specimens that would not normally harbour the virus. In one study in which primers were used that hybridised to regions of the MIE gene, all 44 culture-positive neonates were PCR positive in their urine but none of the 27 culture-negative neonates 4 . When viruses are expected to be present in low concentrations, nested PCR is often used in which initial amplification is followed by another round of amplification using primers internal to the first set. It adds to specificity; however, the increased sensitivity also makes the risk of false positives due to contamination greater. With respiratory specimens, which may have a number of different viruses or even mixed infections, multiplex PCR methods have been developed. This involves using probes to several different viruses in a single amplification reaction. Another use of multiplex PCR is to type viruses, such as parainfluenza viruses.",

It is helpful to be cognisant of this variation for a number of reasons: (i) to identify the spread of outbreaks; (ii) to understand the natural epidemiology of viruses including animal reservoirs; and (iii) to develop more effective vaccines. As genetic variation is a precursor of antigenic variation, subtler differences can best be detected by genome analysis. Multisegmented viruses exhibit gross changes by variation in size of those segments: these can be visualised by agarose or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The genomes of large DNA viruses can be analysed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) mapping (see below) if sufficient virus is available. Oligonucleotide fingerprinting is a useful method for typing RNA genomes. Digestion of the genome with an enzyme, such as ribonuclease T1, for defined periods results in fragments which can be separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis.

Like 3SR, it a transcription-based amplification system (TAS) which utilises 3 enzyme activities: RT, RNAse H and T7 RNA polymerase. An oligonucleotide probe primer is bound to target RNA and the RT makes a DNA copy. RNAase H removes the RNA portion of the RNA-DNA hybrid and allows a second probe primer to anneal downstream. RT then acts as a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase to extend from one probe binding site to the other. One probe primer has a T7 promoter site incorporated so that this enzyme can then produce a further RNA copy to allow the process to start again. Typically, a 10 9 amplification can be achieved. Quantification is usually by competitive amplification with a control as with PCR. NASBA has an inherent advantage over PCR of not being as sensitive to differing amplification conditions and can be used with accurate quantification on a wide range of specimen types. bDNA amplification does not require an internal control template to be quantifiable. It is a signal amplification method that uses branched chain DNA probes that can then act as substrates for further hybridisation reactions if the template is present initially.

The principle of subtraction involves the removal of common sequences in infected and non-infected material with complex sequences. When two samples of broadly similar sequences are compared, the control source is termed the 'driver' and the experimental (infected) source termed the 'tester'. In general, a large excess of driver dsDNA is allowed to hybridise to single-stranded tester nucleic acid. Any non-hybridised single-stranded tester nucleic acid can be separated as presumed unique sequences. Subsequent gene amplification can be achieved by adding unique linkers to all nucleic acids. One of these methods, representational differential analysis (RDA) has been used to identify a novel herpes virus from a vascular tumour common in AIDS patients, Kaposi's sarcoma 9 . RDA simultaneously combines amplification and subtraction. After restriction enzyme digestion to reduce genome complexity, linkers are added to the products to enable subsequent PCR amplification. Smaller fragments are amplified most efficiently. Thus the resulting amplicons may represent only a proportion (typically 10%) of the DNA restriction fragments. By the judicious use of single restriction enzymes for digestion of the genome, it is possible to produce amplicons that represent the entire genome. This is done for both tester and driver DNA. Subsequent steps in the RDA process are shown in Figure 2 . RDA is being applied to a number of diseases of potential viral aetiology.",

The identification of a virus, or any other micro-organism, from patients with a disease is, of course, not sufficient grounds to establish cause and effect. Although not conclusive, the finding of nucleic acid within a diseased cell, but not a normal cell, provides convincing evidence of aetiology. In situ hybridisation enables this. As with other probe methods, in situ PCR is becoming the advancement of choice. In situ PCR can be direct or indirect. Indirect methods involve adding standard PCR reagents to the fixed cells and then post-amplification the products are detected by standard in situ hybridisation.

Utilisation of the IS6110 target has an inherent advantage in that, although both M. tuberculosis and the related M. bovis Bacille-Calmette-Guerin strain are detected, the differences in copy number of the target sequences within the two organisms results in differing patterns of amplification products. Mycobacteria can be found in many bodily fluids but most methods have been developed for use on sputum. Eisenach et al 12 examined 162 sputa for the presence of IS6110 genes. All those that were ZN smear positive were also PCR positive. One of two smear-negative, culture-positive samples were PCR-positive. Two of the 43 smear-negative, culture-negative specimens were also PCR-positive. 26 non-mycobacterial specimens were PCR-negative and one of 42 non-tuberculous mycobacterial specimens. Although the sensitivity was poor with smear-negative specimens, the sample was small. Other studies have supported the finding, however, that PCR-based methods are more sensitive than Ziehl-Neelsen stains 14 .",

Evaluation studies are already showing that for many microorganisms they are cost-effective when compared to standard cultural and serological methods. Automation is the key to the high through-put and rapid turnover of specimens that will be required. This will not only lead to a more specific and sensitive detection of micro-organisms, but drive down the financial costs of molecular diagnostics. The next major advance will be the incorporation of DNA chip technology into routine diagnostics. Probes are bound to a solid phase for detection of unknown, 'interrogated', DNA. The use of a solid phase to bind probes is not novel, being used in commercial PCR systems, but DNA chips involve a very large array of probes of known sequence on a solid surface, 'the chip'. This technology has already been used, with hexamer probes, for DNA sequencing. It has also been applied, empirically, to detect mutations 31 . With the increasing recognition that most bacteria are yet to be recognised, DNA chip technology, allied to sequencing, may speed up the process of establishing true bacterial biodiversity. Biosensor technology to detect binding of bound probe also offers the prospect of rapid through-put and automation. One possibility is the use of membranes that respond chromatically to target-probe binding, e.g. the diacetylenic lipids. Their use has already been described for the detection of bacterial toxins 32 .",
