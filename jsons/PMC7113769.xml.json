Unlike most other IL-10-related cytokines, IL-22 primarily targets nonhematopoietic epithelial cells and fibroblasts (Ouyang and Valdez, 2008, Sonnenberg et al., 2011, Wolk et al., 2004). The IL-22 receptor is composed of two heterodimeric subunits, IL-22R1 and a common IL-10R2 of the IL-10 family (Xie et al., 2000). While the IL-10R2, a shared receptor for IL-10, IL-26, IL-28, and IL-29, is expressed in various tissues, IL-22R1 is primarily expressed in mucosal epithelia such as the intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) (Eidenschenk et al., 2014, Ouyang and Valdez, 2008).",

Initially, studies determined that IL-22 is essential for the host to control the infection of extracellular bacteria in the lung or gut (Eidenschenk et al., 2014, Ivanov et al., 2013, Zheng et al., 2008). Recent evidence indicates that IL-22 has a substantial role in host defense against mucosal viral infection, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), influenza virus, and rotavirus (Hernandez et al., 2015, Ivanov et al., 2013, Kim et al., 2012, Kumar et al., 2013). The mechanism of IL-22 protection against infection is elusive and includes the direct promotion of epithelial survival and regeneration and the maintenance of the tissue barrier, but IL-22 also induces epithelial-secreting antimicrobials such as defensins and antiviral cytokines such as IL-18 (Hernandez et al., 2015, Munoz et al., 2015, Ouyang and Valdez, 2008). Furthermore, IL-22 increases its protective role when combined with IL-18 or IFN-\u03bb (Hernandez et al., 2015, Zhang et al., 2014). Given the critical role of IL-22 in epithelial regeneration, host defense, and pathology, IL-22 is an attractive target for clinical development in animals and humans. However, little knowledge exists regarding porcine IL-22 (pIL-22).",

The most common pathogens of porcine viral diarrhea are porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and porcine rotavirus (PoRV) (Wang et al., 2016, Zhang et al., 2013, Zhao et al., 2016). PEDV and TGEV are alpha coronaviruses (Brian and Baric, 2005), and PoRV is a member of the genus Rotavirus within the Reoviridae family (Taniguchi and Komoto, 2012). All three diarrhea viruses primarily infect villous epithelial cells throughout the small intestine and cause serious injury of IEC, including severe diffuse atrophic enteritis and superficial villous enterocyte swelling (Wang et al., 2016). The manifestations of the infection of the three viruses are indistinguishable and characterized by vomiting, anorexia, watery diarrhea, dehydration, and weight loss, with a high morbidity and mortality in suckling piglets (Wang et al., 2016, Zhang et al., 2013). The co-infection of two or three viruses of PEDV, TGEV, and PoRV in the field is frequent and makes the development of therapeutic and prophylactic strategies to protect suckling pigs against diarrhea complications (Zhang et al., 2013, Zhao et al., 2016).",

Like PoRV, PEDV and TGEV primarily infect small intestinal epithelial cells and cause a similar injury of the intestines with similar clinical signs. We reasoned that mpIL-22 is also capable of curtailing PEDV and TGEV infection in IPEC-J2, as it does in rotavirus infection. Similar to the rotavirus experiment, we stimulated IPEC-J2 cells with mpIL-22 for 24 h before inoculating with PEDV or TGEV. As we expected, mpIL-22 treatment inhibited PEDV and TGEV infection in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3\nA). Pretreatment with 400 ng/ml of mpIL-22 resulted in a more than 90% reduction in infection of PEDV and TGEV, whereas 40 ng/ml mpIL-22 caused a 93.82 \u00b1 0.34% and 68.13 \u00b1 7.34% inhibition of PEDV and TGEV infection, respectively. The anti-coronavirus activity of mpIL-22 was further confirmed by western blotting the N protein expression levels and exhibited a dose-dependent manner for mpIL-22 treatment at 48 hpi compared to those in the control cells (Fig. 3B). PEDV and TGEV showed a different sensitivity to the antiviral activity of mpIL-22; mpIL-22 exhibited a more efficient inhibition of the PEDV infection in IPEC-J2 than TGEV (Fig. 3). mpIL-22 exhibited a significant suppression of PEDV infection from 1 ng/ml (Fig. S2). These results show that IL-22 is a significant innate antiviral cytokine against coronavirus infection within the intestine cells.",

Beta-defensin-2 (BD-2), IL-18 and IFN-\u03bb are among the antimicrobials and antiviral cytokines in small intestinal epithelial cells that are well studied (Chen et al., 2009, Lazear et al., 2015, Schroder and Harder, 1999, Zhang et al., 2014). We initially investigated whether mpIL-22 induced the expression of BD-2, IL-18, and IFN-\u03bb in IPEC-J2. mpIL-22 stimulation increased the transcriptional expression of IL-22-induced gene survivin (Naher et al., 2012) instead of the house-keeping gene \u03b2-actin, indicating that mpIL-22 is biological active and its activity is specific (Fig. 4\n). mpIL-22 pretreatment specifically enhanced the expression of BD-2, IL-18 and IFN-\u03bb in IPEC-J2 cells and exhibited a dose response (Fig. 4A). Next, we determined the time kinetics of the up-regulation of BD-2, IL-18 and IFN-\u03bb mRNA following 40 ng/ml mpIL-22 stimulation. The levels of mRNA of the protective genes instead of \u03b2-actin increased with the time post stimulation and peaked at 48 h post stimulation, with fold increases of 6.50 \u00b1 0.65, 3.48 \u00b1 0.83, and 7.37 \u00b1 4.84 relative to mock control for BD-2, IL-18, and IFN-\u03bb, respectively (Fig. 4B).",

We found that IL-22 induced phosphorylation of STAT3 on Ser727 and Tyr705 in IPEC-J2 cells (Fig. 5\nA).

In concordance with these results, the presence of S3I-201 completely abolished the antiviral activity of mpIL-22 against PEDV, TGEV and PoRV (Fig. 5C). These effects did not result from the S3I-201 cellular cytotoxicity since no changes of cellular viability following treatment with 20 \u03bcM S3I-201 were observed in comparison with mock control (Fig. S4).

The increased IL-22 was detected in the supernatants of the PEDV, TGEV, and PoRV-infected IPEC-J2 cells from 6 to 48 h post infection (Fig. 6\n).

The production of pIL-22 was maintained at a plateau level during the entire PEDV infection period while pIL-22 declined gradually after peaking at 6 hpi for TGEV infection. For PoRV, pIL-22 was induced and increased steadily from 6 to 48 hpi.

To our knowledge, this is the first report that shows that IL-22 inhibits coronavirus infection in epithelia. Given that most coronaviruses infect epithelial cells in the respiratory and/or enteric tracts and that coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and PEDV are important for human health and livestock, it is worthwhile to further develop IL-22 as a potential therapeutic agent against the infection of coronaviruses.",

IL-22 has been linked to elicit the expression of antimicrobial defensins, synergistically cooperate with another mucosal antiviral cytokine IFN-\u03bb, and promote the tissue barrier in IEC to curtail mucosal viral infection. We herein found that porcine IL-22 induced the expression of protective genes BD-2, IFN-\u03bb, and IL-18 in IPEC-J2, especially IFN-\u03bb, which primarily acts on mucosal epithelial cells and exhibits robust antiviral activity within the mucosal surface. Our previous results have demonstrated that porcine IFN-\u03bb substantially curtailed PEDV infection in IPEC-J2 and Vero E6 cells in vitro (Li et al., 2016). Previous studies of rotavirus in mice have shown that IL-22 enhances the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03bb to synergistically amplify the STAT1 signal pathway induced by IFN-\u03bb (Hernandez et al., 2015). Here we reasoned that IL-22 may boost the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03bb by promoting the production of IFN-\u03bb. IL-18, a member of the IL-1 family, is induced by TLR5 activation in IEC and mutually enhanced the antiviral activity of IL-22 (Zhang et al., 2014). IL-22 is indispensable for the induction and maintenance of the expression of IL-18 by IEC during infection with Toxoplasma gondii (Munoz et al., 2015). Our results further reinforce the notion that the synergetic feedback loop between IL-22 and IFN-\u03bb or IL-18 acts on IEC for the protection of the intestine against infection. Therefore, the positive feedback loop among IL-22, IL-18, and IFN-\u03bb consists of a complex mutual regulating cytokine network in the gut and provides synergistic innate immunity to combat mucosal virus infection. Our results and the findings from other groups indicate that the combination of IL-22 with IL-18 or IFN-\u03bb is a potential therapeutic strategy to fight against gut viral pathogens.",
