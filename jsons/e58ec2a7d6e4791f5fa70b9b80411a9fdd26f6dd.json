Medical systems in several countries have been severely tested to the point of near collapse, nosocomial and community transmission are well recognized, and many patients (4) (5) (6) (7) and health care workers (HCW) have tragically succumbed to the infection (8, 9) . Interventional radiology (IR) provides advanced imageguided treatments of a range of patient conditions, from the well to the vulnerable and from elective outpatients to critically ill intensive care unit patients. IR services are essential to hospital operations and to multidisciplinary management of patients even during the current crisis. In this position, IR faces challenges from many aspects. Our patients and our staff must be protected from nosocomial infections above all else, and we must remain prepared to provide sustainable highquality services despite potentially austere conditions (10) .",

At that time, there were inadvertent staff and patient cross-infections, resulting even in mortality. Experts recognize that the current outbreak is very different from that of SARS, despite sharing novel beta-coronavirus causes (13) . Nevertheless, many of the processes described in this paper that were developed and refined to avoid recurrence of such disastrous outcomes remain applicable in the current outbreak. The National Center for Infectious Diseases has been in operation since September 2019. This is a 330-bed (expandable to 500-bed) dedicated, stand-alone facility designed to manage large outbreaks. Additionally, all hospitals have been built or retrofitted with specialized isolation rooms (capable of high-efficiency particle filtration, negative pressure ventilation, and an attached anteroom) (14, 15) . Similarly, several operating rooms and procedure and endoscopy rooms have been built or retrofitted to incorporate negative-pressure ventilation, high-efficiency particulate-absorbing (HEPA) filtration, and an anteroom.",

Radiofrequency identification tags are provided to all staff and patients, which log their physical locations at all times. This requires extensive investment in infrastructure but is by far the most robust method for contact tracing. Close contacts of confirmed cases (eg, those expected to have been within 2 m of the individual for at least 30 minutes and without appropriate PPE) are placed on home quarantine for 14 days with twice daily temperature and symptom surveillance. Those with appropriate PPE at the point of contact are allowed to continue working if the hospital infection control team has assessed the risk of transmission to be small. This risk assessment is necessary because otherwise large numbers of HCW could be quarantined for exposure to an undiagnosed COVID-19 patient who subsequently tested positive for the virus. This is also the reason why all hospital staff must wear surgical masks in all areas where patients are encountered.",

Staff have reported low morale due to heightened measures, restriction of overseas travel, and \"PPE-fatigue.\" Morale-boosting activities, tokens of support from the community, and words of appreciation from senior management have been very helpful. Furthermore, regular timely information is provided by management through the above-mentioned channels to keep everyone updated and to combat speculation and fake news, which have unfortunately been increasing steadily.
