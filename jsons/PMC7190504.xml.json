Nonetheless, there are important ways in which vascular surgeons can contribute to serve patients and support our colleagues. Promotion of social distancing and judicious use of personal protective equipment (PPE) have been key components of the response. To that end, at our institution, elective cases were canceled in mid-March and outpatient clinic visits have been replaced by telehealth encounters whenever possible. The result has been a significant decrease in overall clinical volume across our division and the entire department of surgery.",

Providers in surgical fields, especially residents, have likewise been redeployed to ICUs and medicine teams.

Based on conversations with ICU providers in heavily affected areas such as Italy, New York, and Washington, we became aware that these line placement procedures consumed a large portion of time for critical care providers. As vascular surgeons, we are uniquely positioned to quickly and efficiently perform these bedside procedures, thereby offloading other providers to focus on areas where their skillsets are best utilized. We worked with our institutional leadership to establish a vascular access team with clear, strong guidelines to signal our commitment to the critical care teams; in particular, we established the following key parameters (Table I\n):\u2022The team will be responsible 24/7 for placing all central venous lines, arterial lines, and temporary dialysis catheters for inpatients on the main campus of our hospital system.\u2022The team will commit to provide a page-to-puncture time of 60 minutes or less.\n",

Our multidisciplinary team also concluded that avoiding catheter-related infections was a top priority, as these can be devastating in patients who are already critically ill. Therefore, we place dialysis catheters in the following preferred order: right internal jugular vein, left internal jugular vein, subclavian vein, femoral vein. To preserve the right internal jugular vein for dialysis catheters, we place central venous catheters in the following preferred order: left internal jugular vein, right internal jugular vein, subclavian vein, femoral vein. For arterial access, we prioritize radial artery, followed by brachial artery, followed by femoral artery.",

In addition, we want to be able to replicate this model at other hospitals in our health care system if the clinical need arises. Therefore, we decided to build SWAT teams around two-person units. Each unit consists of a SWAT Lead (4th or 5th year vascular resident or attending) and SWAT Junior (junior vascular resident or advanced practice provider). Having two members on each SWAT team allows us to facilitate pre-procedure tasks such as reviewing history, obtaining consent, and gathering equipment in order to meet our 60-minute target. At our institution, all vascular surgery attendings and residents are credentialed for central and arterial line placement.",

Staying in house also allows the SWAT team to provide 24/7 coverage for all vascular surgery floor and consult patients, thereby relieving the general surgery night float residents from having to cover these patients and freeing them up to take on other COVID-19 related responsibilities. To maintain compliance with the ACGME 80-hour workweek averaged over a 4-week period, providers work for 2 weeks followed by a week off. In case of a vascular surgical emergency, or if multiple line requests arrive in rapid succession, there is a backup team available that is called in to maintain continuous coverage.",

We believe this method will provide significant benefits over ad-hoc stocking from existing supply pools, especially as volume increases.
