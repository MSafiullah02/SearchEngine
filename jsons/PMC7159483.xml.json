The absence of correlation between subjective and objective measures of disease severity has been well documented.5 Although the inclusion of nonrhinologic questions in the SNOT\u201022 score is a possible explanation, no difference was observed when using the more specific ADSS. Another possible explanation may be the timing of sampling. As most viruses tested in the assay are shed from the nasopharynx up to 3 weeks after symptom resolution, it is possible that sampling occurred either during this time or early in the infection prior to symptom development.",

            "text": "The mechanisms underlying the viral contribution to CRS are unknown. Similarly unknown is whether the higher rates of viral infection here observed are a cause or a consequence of CRS. CRS has been well established as a bacterial disease, encompassing bacterial overgrowth, superantigen and biofilm formation, and disruption of the microbiome.6 The link between the bacterial and viral hypotheses of CRS aetiopathogenesis may lie in the ability of viruses to prime the airways for bacterial infection. Viruses damage the epithelial barrier by increasing mucus production, reducing ciliary presence, and reducing tight junction expression. Viruses bind directly to bacteria and upregulate host cell surface molecules to facilitate bacterial\u2010host adherence. Viruses hamper the innate immune system with effects on neutrophil and macrophage recruitment and impairment of natural killer, antigen presenting and T cell activity, leaving the mucosa at risk for bacterial invasion. Viruses alter temperature and variably exhaust or increase the availability of micronutrients, which can allow bacteria in planktonic and biofilm form to proliferate (References in Data S1). The general population, however, is subject to a near\u2010constant onslaught from respiratory viruses but only 16% of individuals develop CRS. The link between these two entities may be related to the interferons (IFN) and their signaling pathways. These cytokines are expressed by almost all cells in response to pathogen invasion and play key roles in innate antiviral immunity. Deficient IFN responses to viral infection have been consistently demonstrated in asthma, a similar disease process to CRS, as well as in CRS itself.7, 8, 9 We hypothesize this lack of early antiviral activity in patients with CRS may result in more frequent, severe, or persistent viral infections, paving the way for the bacterial invasion so critical for disease development. Further research, however, is required to clarify this hypothesis.",
