If these transitions were actual\ndiseases, the lack of consensus on causation, prognosis or the value of\ninterventions would lead to serious questions as to whether the \u2018diagnosis\u2019 was\ncorrect. Even when talking about diseases, \u2018beneath the surface\u2019 reasons behind the\nswitch between chronic infectious and auto-immune disease and longevity as societies\nbecome wealthier are not understood \u2013 important as they represent a major preventive\nopportunity for otherwise \u2018lost generations\u2019. We will suggest, as a few others have\ndone in the context of health and economic losses from malnutrition, that the aspect\nof modernity responsible for all these transitions is diet.1-3 Our contribution relates to\nemphasising the importance of a good diet (rather than simply subsistence) and\ngenerous meat, with the main active component being nicotinamide (Vitamin\nB3). When deficient, this vitamin causes pellagra and the 4D\u2019s of\nDementia (and low intelligence quotient), Diarrhoea (and chronic infections such as\ntuberculosis [TB]), and a characteristic Dermatitis (not always present) along with\npremature Death and a breakdown of symbiotic and social relationships.\nNineteenth-century slave-owners recognised the consequent loss of productivity from\npoor diet and pellagra, yet we still do not fully recognise or act upon their\ninsight when the food chain is longer extending to workers in other poorer\ncountries.",

Other species are domesticated by others, famous examples include\nleaf-cutter ants that farm fungi and, in co-evolutions, become dependent on each\nother\u2019s reproduction, altering genomes and building niche-constructed\nenvironments.4-14 However, no plausible agent\n(some imagine supernatural forces) domesticated us (a fact that stymied Darwin) \u2013 so\nhow did we auto-domesticate and why? We argue that a push down the food chain,\nforced by climate change and over-hunting of megafauna, began an unconscious\nselection of domesticates that merged into conscious selection, experimentation and\ndomestication of plant, animal and even microbial domesticates pulled by higher\nreproductive rates of ourselves on a higher plant-based diet as well as themselves.15 So they domesticated us as we domesticated them \u2013 and all in the cause of\nbipartisan higher fertility, for us more babies. Illuminating wolf-dog and plant\nbreeder experiments show how easily domestication can take place and that the\npre-condition of potential tameness was necessary but the real selective and\nsufficient pressure was higher reproductive rates, as domesticated dogs or\ncrops.16-19",

We have\nargued that this increased fecundity is due to relative immune tolerance of the\nfoetus when on a high cereal diet with low nicotinamide levels, leading to induction\nof the tryptophan to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) pathway.84-89 This is the core hypothesis\nfrom which much else follows. Indeed, this move down the food chain during the\nMesolithic first to horticulture and then agriculture may have saved us, but not the\nNeanderthals, from extinction (at the price of much disease) given that hominid\npopulations were so low at that juncture.90-106 A pro-fertility culture with\nstrong sexual selection and nutri-genomic adaptations contributed. Population\npressure did not initiate this process but once started became part of an unchecked\nratchet requiring more and more food and making it hard to reverse, leading to\nexponential increases on cereal diets, with contributions from cultural and\nreligious beliefs around birth control (religions may rely more on high reproductive\nrates to spread than they do on converts). Now brakes may need to be applied, as\nalthough high populations were undoubtedly beneficial in the past, currently, the\nopposite is generally true, if we are to avoid the agricultural and subsequent Green\nrevolutions becoming \u2018the worst mistakes in the history of the human\nrace\u2019.83,107-113 Our suggestion for how\npopulations expanded in the first place and how demographic transitions are hastened\nby increasing the meat supply is shown in Figure 5.",

Dark skin was\nthought to be our original state with pale skin evolving to allow more Vitamin D\nproduction in northern climes and loss of hair helping with heat control in the\ntropics. However, this now seems unlikely and dark skin evolving to avoid sunburn in\nthe tropics where meat is harder to obtain, and therefore, sunburn could have been\nexacerbated by nicotinamide deficiency and impaired DNA repair is a possible\nscenario.

We have used Parkinson disease as one example, some cancers and the\nmetabolic syndrome may be others, that involve gut dysbioses (in a taxonomic\ndirection suggestive of a high meat diet), T-cell and metabolic disturbance with\nprion-like alpha-synuclein aggregates with spreading behaviour via the vagus\nnerve.161-173 Dementia may also have\nmisleading downstream metabolic, dysbiotic and amyloid and tau and other protein\naggregation but may be related to low nicotinamide levels early or late in life or\nexcessive consumption or catabolism from other stresses.174,175 Similarly, with cancer,\nautoimmune and metabolic syndromes, there is biochemical evidence of loss of\nnicotinamide homeostasis, whether dietary from increased consumption or excessive\ncatabolism, or implied from benefits of measurement and intervention.153,176-203",

In retrospect, if such theories had stuck with\nthe mode of sustenance, rather than expanding to the mode of industrial production,\nthey would have had more traction by majoring on the need for a balanced diet and\nsustainable mixed farming and care of the soil (that then acts as a carbon\nsink).282,283 Similarly, as the physiocrats such as Francois Quesnay, a\nphysician, diagnosed, the basis of economies has to be metabolic, related to land\nand water use, capturing the energy of the sun in a concentrated form that we then\nuse to magnify its effect through a series of positive feedback loops or \u2018zig-zags\u2019\nas illustrated in his 1750\u2019s \u2018Tableau Economique\u2019.284 All their ideas were modernised as \u2018food sovereignty\u2019 and now should happen\nto the benefit of all.285,286",
