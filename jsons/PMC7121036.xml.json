            "text": "Age 120 has often been cited as the maximum life span for humans. This number does not originate in science, but rather in a passage that appears in the Old Testament, \u201cMy spirit will not contend in man forever, for he is mortal; his days will be a hundred and twenty years\u201d (Genesis 6:3). The record for the maximum recorded human life span, or the highest verified age of a member of the human species, living or deceased, is held by Jeanne Calment of France, who died in 1997 at the age of 122 years, 164 days (Exhibit 13.1). There is no validated record of anyone ever surviving to this age or beyond except Mme. Calment. Discounting the case of S. Izumi (who is reputed to have lived 120 years, 237 days) as a case of incorrect documentation, Sarah Knauss appears next in rank for having lived to the age of 119 years, 97 days. Disregarding K. Hongo also (who had an alleged final age of 116 years, 45 days, but whose records were inconsistent), C. Mortenson (115 years, 252 days) is the oldest male ever to have lived. Survival of many persons even to age 100 is conjectural inasmuch as only about one percent of any large population survives to this age.\n",

The identity of this person changes from year to year because of the high risk of death for people who have reached such advanced ages. As of July 1, 2008, the position is held by Edna Parker of USA at age 115 years, 1 month. The oldest living male is T. Tanabe of Japan, who is 112 years, 7 months, old. The maximum age at death in a population in a given year is the age of the oldest decedent in that year. For 2007 the oldest authenticated decedent was E. del Toro of Puerto Rico, who died at age 115 years, 156 days. According to the Gerontology Research Group, as of spring 2008 there were an authenticated 77 living supercentenarians (66 females, 11 males). It is quite possible that there are many supercentenarians in the parts of the world other than in the Western countries, especially in the most populous countries such as India and China, but the records in these countries are inadequate for evaluating and authenticating any claims of superlongevity.",

Next, there is a group of measures showing different percentages of broader totals for the oldest populations. Table 13.2 shows, for example, the percent of the total population that is 85, 95, or 100 and over, the percent 100 and over of those 85 and over, and the percent 85 and over of those 65 and over.

            "text": "Several other measures focus on the population 100 or more and are based on either the actual population or life tables. One is the average or mean age of all persons 100 years or more. I designate this measure the average maximum life span \u2013 survivors; it represents the average age of persons over the age of 100 who are alive on a designated date. Depending on the interest of the analyst, either the data for the actual population or the data in the current life table may be employed to compute it. The corresponding measure for decedents 100 or more in a year is called the average maximum life span \u2013 decedents; it represents the average age at death of those who die at age 100 or beyond in a year. These concepts of life span and their changing values clearly suggest that (maximum) life span is not a fixed number, as has so often been assumed in the past, but may change. Increases in average maximum life span can provide evidence as to whether the members of a given population are tending to live longer or not. Another group measure of extreme longevity, called life endurancy, is a life-table measure only. Life endurancy refers to the age to which 0.005%, 0.001%, or some other specified percent of the initial birth cohort in a life table survives. The shifts in this age for a given level of survivorship from birth may provide evidence that members of a population are living to increasingly advanced ages. Data for these and other measures of extreme longevity are shown in Table 13.3; they are based on the life tables for 1950, 1980, and 2000 prepared by the Office of the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration.\n\n",

There is currently a gap of roughly 25 years between life expectancy at birth in the United States and average maximum life span (77 years vs. about 102 in the year 2000). This difference suggests how much progress in mortality reduction must be made at this time for the average person in the United States to reach the average age of very long-lived persons. Assuming uniform reductions in death rates at every age, age-specific death rates for the United States in the year 2000 would have to decline by over 99% to achieve a life expectancy at birth of 100 for the population of the United States.",

For studying the issues of extended longevity, use can be made of aggregate data as well as microdata (i.e., individual-level data) drawn from the general sources just cited. Particularly valuable are historical data compiled in mortality and population databases. Among the databases that are especially useful for studies of longevity are the Human Mortality Database (Univ. of Calif., Berkeley), the Utah Population Database (University of Utah), the Ume\u00e5 Demographic Database (Ume\u00e5 University, Sweden), the Iceland Demographic Database (deCODE genetics), the International Database on Longevity (Montpelier University and Max Planck Institute), and the Kannisto-Thatcher database on Old-Age Mortality (Odense University). For example, the Iceland database links genealogical data to medical information for the country\u2019s entire population (Amundadottir et al. 2004) and the Utah database provides genealogical, genetic, epidemiological, and demographic information for over 6.5 million individuals in the United States.",

Often the people at these ages are unable to respond to census takers, so others, such as family members, neighbors, or nursing-home staff, report on their behalf with regard to their residence, age, and other demographic characteristics. Population coverage at particular ages in the census may be grossly misstated and ages are often misreported. In one classic example of age misstatement, analysts at the Social Security Administration determined that a significant number of people who were listed as centenarians in the 1990 Census were, in fact, under the age of 10 (Kestenbaum 1992). The reason for the error was that the wrong century was recorded as the year of birth. Census Bureau analysts discovered a similar problem in the 1970 census.",

            "text": "Numerous devices have been employed to improve the quality of census population data. First, it is important to edit the microdata for obvious errors of reporting or processing. This procedure may eliminate only some of the erroneous entries but it is used largely to adjust the data only for gross errors. Sometimes more drastic adjustments or modifications are required. In one unusual case, the census of Taiwan in 2000, the elderly were reenumerated in face-to-face interviews after the initial general census had been conducted by mail-back methods (Yue 2005). Alternatively, the census data may be replaced by estimates when the original data are thought to be unreliable. One method of doing this is to extend census data from younger ages forward to the next census date by methods of demographic analysis. For example, the population 80 years and over may be \u201csurvived\u201d 10 years with the use of current survival rates in order to reestimate the population 90 years and over: 13.1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$${ }_{\\mathrm{as}}{\\mathrm{P}}_{90+} {=\\, }_{\\mathrm{as}}\\!{\\mathrm{P}}_{80+}\\, {{_\\ast}\\,}_{\\mathrm{as}}{\\mathrm{S}{}_{\\mathrm{a},\\mathrm{a}+5}}^{\\mathrm{a}+10,\\mathrm{a}+15}$$\n\\end{document} where as refers to age/sex detail and \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$${\\mathrm{S}{}_{\\mathrm{a},\\mathrm{a}+5}}^{\\mathrm{a}+10,\\mathrm{a}+15}$$\n\\end{document} is a survival rate for a 5-year age group for a 10-year time period.

In recent decades two international collaborative efforts have been undertaken to assemble international databases on supercentenarians. One source of data on this special group is the International Database on Longevity, maintained by Montpelier University and the Max Planck Institute (Robine and Vaupel 2002), and the other is the Gerontology Research Group, which is located at the University of California at Los Angeles. Records in more than 10 countries of alleged supercentenarians are being collected from national statistical offices, health departments, other government agencies, and private sources, and validated by teams of researchers. They apply a variety of rigorous tests of assessing age, and maintain a running tally of all verified supercentenarians currently alive and of all previously authenticated supercentenarians. At the end of 2007 more than 500 validated records of supercentenarians have been assembled by these groups.

The annual changes in the current numbers of 100-year-olds reflect past changes in numbers of births, survival rates, and net migration. The numbers of current and future centenarians tend to rise if either past births or survival rates rose, if both rose, or if net migration led to an increase in population numbers. Similarly, the numbers of centenarians tend to fall if either the number of births or survival rates fell, if both fell, or if net migration was negative. For a heavily immigrant country with improving mortality, such as the United States was over the last century, the numbers of births would tend to rise from year to year a century earlier and the current numbers of centenarians would tend to increase from year to year. Concomitantly, the maximum age at death would tend to rise from year to year because, with each passing year, a greater number of survivors will reach any particular extreme age and will be available to survive to a higher age. The maximum age of survivors and of deaths will also tend to rise if the number of births remains unchanged and survival rates rise.13 On the other hand, if either the number of births or survival rates fall, the number of centenarians, the maximum age at death, and maximum life span would tend to fall in later years. In sum, there is a long-term relation between the change in birth-cohort size and mortality trends, on the one hand, and maximum age at death and maximum life span, on the other.13\n",

In 1950 the age corresponding to a life endurancy with a probability of 0.01 was 96.3 years, and based on death rates at that time, 0.24% of the initial birth cohort would survive to age 100.0. The corresponding figures in 2000 were age 100 and 1.22% of the initial cohort. From these figures and the others in Tables 13.2 and 13.3, we can reasonably conclude that survival to the century mark has been increasing, but that the measures of progress within the centenarian population do not show this trend.

Recall that the rate of increase in death rates according to the Gompertz model approximates constancy at most adult ages but then tends to slacken off at the very advanced ages. At the more extreme ages the rate of increase may possibly become zero or even negative, although one cannot be certain of the pattern because of the sparseness of the data above age 105. As stated in Chap. 4, the phenomenon of decelerating old-age mortality was actually observed and reported by Gompertz using English data (Gompertz 1825). It has been known for more than 175 years, therefore. Other analysts have noted it in the years since 1825 and several of them have described it recently: Robine and Vaupel (2002); Horiuchi and Wilmoth (1998); Wilmoth (1998); Olshansky et al. 1998; and Robine and Saito (2003). The phenomenon has been observed to occur in several countries, and it has also been observed in a number of subhuman species. Robine and Vaupel (2002) reported, on the basis of the experience of a list of validated supercentenarians constructed from the International Database on Longevity (IDL; n = 159), a probability of dying at age 110 of 0.52 and then virtual stability of the rate just below this level until age 114.

The upward trend in maximum recorded life span may come to a halt and reverse itself at any time. Past increases in the size of the population at advanced ages cannot assure us that the maximum age at death will continue to rise, because the sizes of birth cohorts a century earlier or survival rates at some higher ages may fall. The slowing of the rise of mortality rates in later life may be due in large part to the heterogeneity in the health composition of the members of a cohort. The concept of heterogeneity here implies that any cohort includes subgroups with different risk levels and, as a result, the subgroups with the higher hazard rates die off in greater numbers earlier in life while those with lower hazard rates survive to later ages. This process transforms the population in the advanced age groups into one with more uniformly lower mortality levels than the \u201csame\u201d population at the younger ages, which included the less healthy subgroup that was eliminated. This process may also result in populations at the advanced ages that are healthier than the population in the same advanced ages at an earlier date. It can be demonstrated that the rate of increase in death rates with rising age of a population group can fall even though the death rates for the two segments of this group with different hazard rates are rising. However, some analysts argue that the relative declines in age-specific death rates at the advanced ages have been too great to be accounted for wholly by heterogeneity with regard to health (Vaupel 1997; Wachter 2003). They maintain that the deceleration of death rates is due in large part to declines in the hazard rate for individuals.",

It is reasonable to contend, therefore, that the death rates from endogenous diseases are unlikely to decline during the next several decades at the same rate as they declined during the last several decades, and that overall age-specific death rates will not decline in this century at the same rate as they declined during the last century.

There is no evidence that the age of onset of any major endogenous disease has been raised, although establishing the age of onset of a disease is rather difficult. We have been able only to manage some of these conditions better so that their disabling effects are postponed and the quality of life for persons having the conditions is improved (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, atherosclerosis). Clearly some additions to life expectancy may result from medical interventions but these interventions can extend life expectancy only within narrow limits. Some classes of diseases may prove to be intractable. For example, the death rates from various forms of violence were reduced by only one-third between 1970 and 2000, so that these causes may be expected to continue contributing substantially to future mortality. As mentioned, the death rate for several leading endogenous diseases (e.g., cancer, nephritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, Alzheimer\u2019s disease) and septicemia, rose in this period and they may be expected to \u201cride high\u201d for a long time.

With increasing age, molecules, cells, organs, and physiological systems lose their functional capacity. In this way age changes increase the vulnerability to death of humans and other forms of life. Aging in later life may be regarded largely as a stochastic (i.e., random) process associated with biological changes in the body. Hayflick (1998, 2004) describes the aging process from a biological point of view as the stochastically driven, systemic loss of molecular fidelity that, after reproductive maturation, exceeds repair capacity in animals that reach a fixed size in adulthood. Carey (2002) refers to aging as a shifting pattern of vulnerability to genetic and environmental insults. With advancing age the body finds it more and more difficult to maintain homeostasis (i.e., internal equilibrium of the various physiological systems), in spite of ongoing efforts toward repair, compensation, and accommodation. These efforts become increasingly less effective, and at some point it becomes impossible to achieve the proper functioning of one system without compromising the functioning of another system or systems and life itself is threatened. Biological research suggests, then, that death is the result of a number of probabilistic events, reinforcing one another.",

In their view survival to an age much beyond these years will be limited until such knowledge is secured. Hayflick (1998, 2000) is equally conservative. He argues that extending human life span can only be achieved by probing into the causes of the aging of cells, i.e., by determining why older cells are more likely to fail than younger cells, and he reminds us that, relatively speaking, not much research effort is being directed at this basic question. He doubts that the human life span can be significantly prolonged by genetic engineering.

Postreproductive individuals are rarely found in nature except in a few species, and the period of postreproductive survival in nonhumans is relatively short (Austad 1997). In contrast, such individuals are common in captivity, especially among other primates. We seek to know whether the long postreproductive life of humans is an adaptive result of natural selection or is a non-adaptive artifact analogous to the postreproductive life of captive animals. According to Austad (1997), the commonality of postreproductive survival among captive animals does not mean that their increased longevity has evolutionary significance; these animals were simply not designed for such a long survival. Carey (2003) notes that various species have latent mechanisms, set in motion by certain environmental conditions, to enhance their abilities at somatic maintenance and repair at the cost of reproduction. Among these environmental conditions that may contribute to their longevity is a scarcity of resources that may postpone certain physical developments in the species. Parents\u2019 raising younger generations and playing a role in intergenerational support may also prolong postmenopausal life. In contributing to the survival of their children and grandchildren, parents and grandparents serve a function in the evolutionary scheme.",

            "text": "Three factors appear, then, to account principally for the extension of life expectancy of humans beyond the prime reproductive years. First, evolution has endowed the body with a reserve capacity so as to assure the completion of its reproductive mission. It would be inefficient to risk failure in this mission by not building in such a reserve capacity, given the ever-present extrinsic factors vying for the life of the person. This implies that survival well past the end of the reproductive period can occur because we are essentially living on our physiological reserves. Next, evolution may have a \u201creproductive\u201d role for older people. Most parents become grandparents and are thus available to nurture and train the young, who may go on to achieve successful reproduction (Vaupel 2003; Austad 1997). The extended longevity of homo sapiens evolved in a socio-ecological context of favorable environments (e.g., extensive parental care and investment, a high level of sociality), similar to the experience of subhuman primates and eusocial insects (Carey 2002). Finally, trends in life expectancy suggest that human intervention may have contributed to the success of many people in approximating, and of some people in exceeding, their biological warranty period. Survival into the postreproductive years has been achieved by human ingenuity and self-discipline, including public health innovations, medical developments, environmental improvements, increased knowledge of how to care for oneself, and especially lifestyle changes (Carey 2003).",

The classical evolutionary theory of senescence generally supports the view that the mortality rates at the higher ages in most species rise steadily, possibly exponentially. However, Carey et al. (1992) and Curtsinger et al. (1992) have shown that the hazard rates at extreme ages in several invertebrate species (e.g., medflies, nematode worms, and yeast) do not continue to rise exponentially. In numerous species the fundamental shape of the hazard curve is approximated by the Gompertz formula (that is, a pattern of unchanging rates of increase in the hazard rates from young adulthood) only up to a point, after which the hazard rates decelerate (Finch 1990). This interspecies similarity suggests that the same biological patterns apply to human and subhuman species.

Extended human survival in the postreproductive segment of the life span is determined by the excess physiological capacity available after the period of reproductive success. Natural selection and evolution operate only up through the reproductive period, but then other biological, cultural, technological, and social influences begin to dominate. Life expectancies at birth that extend beyond the reproductive years are a recent historical phenomenon. Large-scale survival into the postreproductive period and the associated ascendance of the intrinsic causes of death over the extrinsic causes in the mortality schedule reflect the triumph of human ingenuity over many extrinsic causes and the apparent success of human intervention over the evolutionary process. At present, evolutionary biologists cannot agree on a convincing and consistent explanation for the considerable postreproductive extension of human life, but the several factors noted appear to play important roles (Austad 1997).",

For example, DHEAS (i.e., dihydroepiandrosterone sulphate), the major sex steroid produced by the adrenal glands, is claimed to have anti-aging effects. DHEAS levels decline greatly with age. Low DHEAS has been associated with increased cardiovascular mortality in older men. The relation of DHEAS and mortality in older women has not been firmly established, but a U-shaped relation between the level of the hormone and adverse effects in women has been tentatively shown (Cappola et al. 2006). A U-shaped relation has commonly been seen by researchers in endocrinological conditions. Such a pattern of pathology with deficiency and excess is seen in hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and Cushing\u2019s syndrome and adrenal insufficiency. Understanding this relation is important in order to determine whether dietary supplementation of DHEAS is desirable for prevention of premature mortality.",

It is being evaluated for its effectiveness in stimulating the growth of blood vessels (i.e., angiogenesis) and reducing, for example, the effects of peripheral artery disease. Alternatively, gene therapy is being evaluated for its effectiveness in suppressing angiogenesis (i.e., anti-angiogenesis) and thus cutting off the blood supply to unwanted body growths. Anti-angiogenesis therapy in the form of anti-angiogenic drugs is being experimentally used to treat macular degeneration.
