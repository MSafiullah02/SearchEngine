            "text": "Feline CoV (FCoV) is transmitted via the faecal-oral route and infects primarily enterocytes (Pedersen 1995), but subsequently spreads systemically via a monocyte-associated viraemia (Gunn-Moore et al., 1998, Kipar et al., 1999, Kipar et al., 2005, Meli et al., 2004, de Groot-Mijnes et al., 2005). FCoV-infected circulating monocytes are responsible for both viral dissemination and, in an activated state, development of vasculitis (Weiss and Scott, 1981a, Weiss and Scott, 1981b, Pedersen, 1995, Kipar et al., 2005). Also, regardless of the development of FIP, FCoV infection is associated with increased numbers of (proliferating) monocytes/macrophages in haemolymphatic tissues (Kipar et al., 1999, Kipar et al., 2001a). On the other hand, it has been suspected that higher levels of viral replication could be a prerequisite for the occurrence of the virulent viral mutants among the quasispecies cloud generally seen in infected animals as a consequence of the high rate of viral mutation (Vennema et al., 1998, Gunn-Moore et al., 1999). Considering also the role of monocytes/macrophages as mediators of both viral replication and formation of granulomatous lesions in FIP, the question arises as to whether the long-term outcome of FCoV infection might relate to the degree of viral replication within an infected individual. We, therefore, performed a relative quantitation of FCoV RNA loads in haemolymphatic tissues in naturally FCoV-infected cats with and without FIP.",

Brain and spinal cord involvement was characterised by a granulomatous leptomeningitis, often with granulomatous phlebitis and periphlebitis. The latter was also observed occasionally in eyes, renal cortices and lungs. Diagnosis of FIP was confirmed by immunohistological demonstration of FCoV antigen within macrophages in lesions (Kipar et al 1998). Group 2 consisted of 13 apparently healthy specific pathogen-free cats, aged 1 year, who had been housed for 30 weeks with cats developing FIP (Kipar et al 1999). All group 2 cats had shown positive results in tests for CoV antibodies, circulating FCoV-specific immune complexes and monocyte-associated FCoV viraemia (Kipar et al 1999).",

For samples where an FCoV-RNA signal was not observed after 45 cycles, an approximated C\nT value was created. In order to get this value, the lowest C\nT for fGAPDH obtained from the sample with the highest expression of GAPDH was subtracted from 45 (number of cycles). The resulting value was rounded to the next higher integer value. For each sample, relative quantitation of FCoV amounts was achieved by calculating the difference between the fGAPDH C\nT value and the FCoV C\nT value (\u0394C\nT). These served to both normalise for differences in the amount of total nucleic acid added to each reaction and to compare the amount of FCoV RNA in the different tissue samples, and expressed as 2\u2212\u0394CT.",

            "text": "Previous in vitro studies provided evidence that FCoV virulence is associated with higher effectiveness of infecting and replicating in peritoneal macrophages (Stoddart and Scott 1989). This is further supported by a recent study which showed by means of a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction specific for FCoV mRNA that replication of FCoV in circulating monocytes occurs mainly in cats with FIP (Simons et al 2005). We could show that cats with FIP have higher viral loads in spleen, lymph nodes and bone marrow, the major organs harbouring monocytes/macrophages, the cells mediating FCoV viraemia. Taken together, all these findings indicate that enhanced viral replicative capacity could be a key feature in the development of FIP. This could be characteristic for the virulent variants of FCoV which are predominantly formed within the individual infected host and characterised by deletions in genes encoding non-structural proteins of yet unknown function, which develop during replication (Vennema et al., 1998, Kennedy et al., 2001). On the other hand, it is possible that reduced capacity for viral clearance in cats developing and/or suffering from FIP, possibly overall or only in monocytes/macrophages, is responsible for the higher viral loads in cats with FIP. Evidence for this was provided by a recent study which observed rise in blood viral RNA levels together with immunosuppression in cats with end-stage FIP (de Groot-Mijnes et al 2005). This supports the idea that the viral loads in infected animals are a consequence of individual host factors, particularly the immune response (Herrewegh et al., 1997, de Groot-Mijnes et al., 2005).",
