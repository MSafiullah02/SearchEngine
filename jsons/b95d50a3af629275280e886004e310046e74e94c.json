            "text": "In recent years, Big Data analytics has gained relevant interest from both industries and academia thanks to its possibilities to open up new shapes of data analysis as well as its essential role in the decision-making processes of enterprises. Different studies [8] , highlight the importance of big data, among other sectors, for the railway industries. The insight offered by big data analytics covers different areas of the railway industry, including and not limited to maintenance, safety, operation, and customer satisfaction. In fact, according to the growing demand for railway transportation, the analysis of the huge amount of data produced by the railway world has a positive impact not only in the services offered to the customers but also for the railway providers. Knowledge extracted from raw data enables railway operators to optimize the maintenance costs and enforce the safety and reliability of the railway infrastructure by the adoption of new analytical tools based on descriptive and predictive analysis. Maintenance of railway lines encompasses different elements placed along the railway track, including but not limited to signals and points. Our interest is mainly on predictive maintenance tasks that aim to build a variety of models with the scope of monitoring the health status of the points composing the line. Typical predicting metrics of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) and Time To Failure (TTF) enable predictive maintenance by estimating healthy status of objects and replacing them before failures occur. Despite unquestionable value of big data for the railway companies, according to [3] big data analytics is not fully adopted by them, yet due to different aspects mainly related with the lack of understanding on how big data can be deployed into railway transportation systems and the lack of efficient collection and analysis of massive amount of data. The goal of our work is to design a big data architecture for enabling analytical tasks typical required by the railway industry as well as enabling an effective data management policy to allows end-users to manage huge amounts of data coming from railway lines efficiently. As already mentioned, we considered predictive maintenance as the main task of our architecture; hence to show the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, we use real data collected from points placed over the Italian railway line (Milano -Monza -Chiasso). The complexity of the considered system poses different challenges for enabling efficient management of the huge amount of data. The first challenge concerns the collection of the data given the heterogeneity of the data sources. Multiple railway points produce distinct log files, which must be collected and processed efficiently. The second challenge is to deal with the data itself. Data collected from the system must be stored as raw data without any modification to preserve the original data in case of necessity (e.g., in case of failures, further analyses require to analyze data at a higher level of granularity). At the same time, collected data must be processed and transformed to be useful for analysis thus, data must be pre-processed and aggregated before fitting models for analytics. Finally, the data analysis performed by the end-users requires analytical models to perform predictive or descriptive analysis; thus, the architecture should enable model creation as well as graphical visualization of results.",

Most works focus on theoretical frameworks where simulations produce results without experimenting with real data. Moreover, researchers mainly focus on Machine Learning algorithms as well as analytical models, giving less importance to the fundamental tasks related to data management, ingestion processing, and storage. Close to our work in [9] , authors propose a cloud-based big data architecture for real-time analysis of data produced by on-board equipment of high-speed trains. However, the proposed architecture presents scalability issues since it is not possible to deploy large-scale computing clusters in high-speed trains; neither is it possible to deploy a fully cloud-based architecture due to bandwidth limitation of trains which make infeasible transferring huge amount of data to the cloud to perform real-time analysis. On the contrary, the scope of our work is to define a scalable Big Data architecture for enabling analytical tasks using railway data. For this reason and due to space limit, we have reported only work related to the railway scenario.",

            "text": "In our work, we take into consideration the data log files produced by a railway interlocking system. A railway interlocking is a complex safety-critical system that ensures the establishment of routes for trains through a railway yard [1] . The computer-based interlocking system guarantees that no critical-safety condition (i.e., a train circulate in a track occupied by another train) will arise during the train circulation. Among other actions issued by the interlocking, before the route is composed, it checks the state of each point along the line. The interlocking system produces log files that store information about the command issued to the point as well as data about its behavior. Commands are issued by the interlocking through smart boards, which in turn control the physical point on the line and collect data about their status. Once data are collected, they are written into the data storage of the interlocking system as log files. These log files can be both structured and semi-structured data and contain diverse information about the behavior of the points upon the requests sent by the interlocking system. Requests may vary according to the logic that must be executed to set up a route (e.g., a switch point is moved from the normal to the reverse position or vice versa) and this implies that the information contained in log files may vary. A complete railway line is controlled by multiple interlocking systems, which in turn produce different log files according to the points they control. The analytical task which motivates the design of our architecture is the prediction of failures. A failure may occur when a mechanical part of points has a break. This kind of failure propagates negatively on the entire railway traffic; therefore, its prediction is desirable. Moreover, instead of doing maintenance when a failure occurs, it is also useful in particular, to estimate the RUL of point in order to enable predictive maintenance by estimating if a points will fail or not in a certain time-frame. Predicting failures of railway points requires to take into consideration the log files produced by the interlocking whenever a command is issued to a point. These log files are heterogeneous in type and contain different information resumed as: Data 3 and 4 are considered to train and evaluate the proposed model to estimate the health status of the points, thus to estimate its RUL (see Sect. 5).",

To avoid situations in which data stored in the platform become not usable due to multiple challenges related to their complexity, size, variety, and lack of metadata, we adopt a mechanism of URI 1 abstraction to simplify data access, thus establishing a data governance policy. As an example, at the storage layer, the URI of a resource is simply its absolute path. In order, to avoid the definition of multiples URIs for each resource (since they can be used by multiple components at different architectural layer), we define a URI abstraction mechanism to simplify the access to resources since they are stored in a distributed manner (where keeping track of the physical location of a resources could be tricky). Therefore the RealURI refers to a resource stored on the distributed filesystem abstracting its physical location. A RealURI is bound to a single VirtualURI, which is in charge of abstracting the details of paths adopted by a particular implementation of a distributed filesystems. A PresentationURI is an optional URI created whenever a component of the Processing layer or Service layer uses a resource stored on the filesystem. As an example, the URI abstractions defined for a single resource are reported in Table 1 . Each resource is identified by 1) a smartboard id, 2) a channel number that controls a specific point, 3) a point number which identifies the object on the line. These metadata are extracted from the data described in Sect. 3. through the tasks provided by the Ingestion layer described in the next section. In addition, the VirtualURI refers to the resource at a platform level, while the PresentationURI represents a HIVE table view of the data created by the processing layer (see Sect. 5). We stress the fact that while resources can be assigned to an unbounded number of Pre-sentationURI, depending on the type of components that consume the data, the VirtualURI is mandatory and it refers to a single RealURI.

The definition of a data management policy allows to collects, govern, and controls raw data as well as enabling data analysis for end-users. The proposed platform has been deployed in a test environment using a containerization technology Fig. 6 . We adopted two separate containers, which respectively implement the data storage & processing layers plus the ingestion layer in a separate environment. These containers communicate over a virtual network, which allows exchanging data in an isolated environment exposing web services to access the platforms and perform tasks. This deployment enables scalability of the architecture by moving containers on a cluster. Cloudera pre-built image has been adopted as a container implementing the Hadoop stack, while a separate container based on Apache NiFi has been proposed to perform the ingestion tasks.

            "text": "As an example to show the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, we report the creation of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for failure detection of a specific railway point along the railway line Milano-Monza-Chiasso. LSTM models are a special kind of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) widely employed by both Academia and Industries for failure prediction [6] . A key aspect of RNN is their ability to store information or cell state for use later to make new predictions. Therefore these aspects make them particularly suitable for analysis of temporal data like analysis of sensor readings for detecting anomalies. For the considered scenario, we use sensor reading collected from a specific switch point positioned along the line. Data originated from the point includes measurements of power supplied to the object, voltage, and time of movement (to move from a normal to a reversal position or vice-versa) of types described in Sect. 3 and reported in Fig. 2 . Once data are ingested, we use components composing the Processing Layer to produce useful datasets for anomalies detection using the techniques described in the previous sections. Results of the aggregation process produce a dataset consisting of 2443 samples, which are used as input for training the model. The evaluation part is performed using reference data, which represents threshold values above which failures occur (89 samples). Examples of features used for training the model are reported in Fig. 7, 8, 9 . The autoencoder model used to make predictions learns a compressed representation of the input data and then learns to reconstruct them again. The idea is training the model on data not containing anomalies; therefore, the model will likely to be able to reconstruct healthy samples. We expect that until the model predicts healthy samples, its reconstruction error (representing the distance between the input and the reconstructed sample) is low. Whenever the model processes data outside the norm as the ones represented by the reference data, which consist of threshold values, we expect an increase in the reconstruction error as the model was not trained to reconstruct these kinds of data. Therefore, we use the reconstruction error as an indicator for anomaly detection. Figure 10 reports anomalies detected by trying to predict reference values. In particular, we will see an increase of the reconstruction error on those values which are greater than a threshold of 0.25. This threshold was obtained by computing the error loss on the training set. Therefore, we identified this value suitable for the point considered as a case study, but it varies according to the particular behavior of the object. For example, considering two objects having the same characteristics (e.g., switch points) placed in different railway network topologies, may have different behaviors; therefore, they must be analyzed using different prediction models.

Despite big data attract railways industries, many challenges have to be faced to enable effective big data analysis of railway data. This work proposes a four-layer architecture for enabling data analytics of railway points. Each layer is loosely coupled with others; therefore, it enables the integration of diverse data processing components intra-layers and inter-layers. To show the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, we reported the analysis of a railway switch points using predictive models for detecting failures. Nevertheless, instead of being task-oriented, the proposed architecture integrates different data processing tools to perform diverse analytical tasks as real-time data analysis. A data governance policy has been defined to deal with the variety and the complexity of railway data making them easily manageable at different granularity levels. A containerized deployment has been proposed to scale the architecture on a cluster, increasing up its scalability, thus enabling parallel data processing. Our architecture can also be extended according to the nature of the task to perform. In fact, it allows practitioners to extend architectural components to fulfil different tasks not limited to failure prediction. Moreover, in this work, we did not consider any real-time scenario in which data must be analyzed using streaming techniques, but the architecture flexibility also allows to deal with such cases. As future work, the analytical layer will be extended, proposing a comparison of different classes of predictive algorithms to measure their accuracy in diverse predictive maintenance tasks of a railway system. Moreover, we aim to extend the scope of the architecture by monitoring other kinds of infrastructures, including but not limited to power grids and highways intelligent systems.",
