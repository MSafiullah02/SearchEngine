Both Western blot and ELISA are used to detect HIV infection in the blood. They are called indirect tests as they measure the immune system's response to an infectious agent rather than looking for the components of the agent itself. Since ELISA detects HIV antibodies which the body starts to produce between 2 and 12 weeks after becoming infected with HIV, one should wait for at least 3 months to confi rm for HIV AIDS . Western blot is the most common method of testing to confi rm positive results from ELISA test. It is used more as a confi rmatory test as it is diffi cult to perform and requires high skills. One advantage of Western blot is that it is less likely to give false-positive results as it can effectively distinguish between HIV antibodies and other antibodies.",

The key idea was to use a line of myeloma cells that had lost their ability to secrete antibodies, fuse these cells with healthy antibody-producing B cells, and select for the successfully fused cells. In hybridoma technology , a myeloma cell rendered drug sensitive through mutation in a growth essential gene, hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase ( HGPRT ), is chemically fused with immune cells from a host immunized with the antigen of interest, and the resulting cells are grown in medium containing the selective drug. Since the immune cells have a short life span in tissue culture and the myeloma cells are drug sensitive, the only cell that will survive are those myeloma cells which obtained a normal HGPRT gene from the immune cells. Such cells also have a high likelihood of carrying the immune cell's antibody gene resulting in the generation of a hybridoma that can grow continuously in vitro and secrete a single monoclonal antibody ( Fig. 9 .3 ).",

When the DNA sequence of a gene differs by only one nucleotide between two individuals, they are called as alleles. SNP analysis can be done in a single step by using genomic DNA and PCR method ( Fig. 9.7 ) . A single SNP analysis can be done by using a specifi c primer attached to a fl uorescence marker, also known as a quenching probe or Q-Probe. When the primer binds with a specifi c DNA sequence, the fl uorescence is quenched due to association with guanine residue. When it disso-ciates, the fl uorescence is acquired. When the primer binds to the wild-type allele, the dissociation occurs at a higher temperature, whereas in a mutant allele, the binding is weak and dissociation takes place at a lower temperature. This change in dissociation curve is analyzed. Two different colors can be used for multiplex analysis .",

In future there are chances that by viewing the SNPs profi le of an individual, the physicians might be able to fi nd out the risks associated and plan a personalized medicine. SNPs help in determining the likelihood of a person to develop a particular disease. One of the genes associated with Alzheimer's disease in apolipoprotein E or ApoE . It contains two SNPs that result in three possible alleles for this gene: E2, E3, and E4. Each allele differs by one DNA base, and the protein product of each gene differs by one amino acid. Each individual inherits one maternal copy of ApoE and one paternal copy of ApoE . A person who inherits at least one E4 allele has a greater chance of developing Alzheimer's disease, whereas inheriting the E2 allele reduces the likelihood of developing Alzheimer's. SNPs are not absolute indicators of disease development. ApoE is just one gene that has been linked to Alzheimer's. Like most common chronic disorders such as heart disease, diabetes , or cancer, Alzheimer's is a disease that can be caused by variations in several genes. The polygenic nature of these disorders is what makes genetic testing for them so complicated.",

There are several disorders that have adult onset and worsen over time. Hence is it advisable for individuals with high risk to undergo genetic testing and counseling. Tests are available for several genetic disorders and cancers. Some of them are sickle cell anemia, Down's syndrome, Huntington's disease, cystic fi brosis, breast cancer, and phenylketonuria. There are three forms of genetic testing. They are diagnostic testing, carrier testing, and predictive testing. Diagnostic testing involves identifi cation of a current disease state. This includes prenatal and newborn genetic testing. Carrier testing includes if an individual carries a particular genetic trait that he or she can pass on to the next generation.
