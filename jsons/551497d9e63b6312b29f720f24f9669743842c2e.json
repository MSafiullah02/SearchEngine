            "text": "On university campuses, social interactions among students can explain their academic experiences. However, assessing these interactions with surveys fails to capture their dynamic nature. While these behaviors can be captured with client-based passive sensing, these techniques are limited in scalability. By contrast, infrastructure-based approaches can scale to a large cohort and infer social interactions based on collocation of students. This paper investigates one such approach by leveraging WiFi association logs archived by a managed campus network. In their raw form, access point logs can approximate a student's location but with low spatio-temporal resolution. This paper first demonstrates that processing these logs can infer the collocation of 46 students in 34 lectures over 3 months, with a precision of 0.89 and a recall of 0.75. Next, we investigate how this WiFi-based coarse collocation reflects signals of social interaction. With 163 students in 54 project groups, we find that member performance shows a correlation of 0.75 with performance determined from collocation of groups through 14 weeks. Additionally, this paper presents preliminary insights for other campus-centric applications of automatically inferred social interactions. Finally, this paper discusses how repurposing archival WiFi logs can facilitate applications for other domains like mental wellbeing and physical health.

            "text": "These limitations include technical issues like variations in compatibility with a user's existing devices or their privacy perspectives [59] . Even when such technologies are installed on client devices, they are dependent on the user's maintenance (e.g., keeping devices charged). In addition, group-level or community-level insights with client-based technologies requires collective motivation and involvement of multiple individuals. Together these factors challenge the scalability of such methods because they provide a sparse representation of the community. An alternative to infer these social behaviors is to use infrastructure-based techniques, such as installing Bluetooth beacons into the built environment [11] . In comparison to client-based methods, these approaches are not as dependent on user variability in adoption to generate insights. And therefore, they are more capable of studying social interactions in a large cohort. However, these approaches often rely on additional augmentation of the infrastructure and are often devoid of valuable archival data (before installation). Archival data can be valuable to inspect behaviors in the context of prior campus-scale events (e.g., exam week, violent incidents, shutdowns, and pandemics). We posit that campuses can consider harnessing logs stored in their existing WiFi network infrastructure to study social behavior. While the logs provide only a coarse notion of location, prior work shows this can be enough to infer individual behaviors related to mental wellbeing [71], as well as utilization of the physical spaces on a campus [16] . Motivated by such efforts, this paper inspects the feasibility of using coarse WiFi network data to understand students' social interactions on campus premises.",

            "text": "WiFi network log entries make it possible to approximate where an individual is by knowing the locations of the access points (APs) [58] . However, this sense of location is low on spatial-temporal resolution. The range of an AP is variable and imprecise [30] and the log updates are also at irregular intervals [61] . As a result, it is important to first gauge the reliability of such logs to collocate multiple individuals. Once students can be identified as collocated, it can lend to understanding if they were socially interacting. However, in itself, the co-presence of students in a space does not warrant that their actions are interlinked [52] . Yet, when individuals gather in a space with a common intent, it can describe their relationship to each other-this aspect of human interactivity is known as spatiality [45] . This encourages an inspection to tease apart the signals of social interaction that can be represented by this coarse notion of collocation. Our specific research questions in this paper are: RQ1: How reliably can WiFi network logs identify collocated individuals? RQ2: To what extent can WiFi-based coarse collocation represent meaningful signals of social interactions?",

To investigate the reliability of collocations derived from network logs, we develop and test our approach with the attendance records of 46 students through 34 lectures, spanning 3 months. Subsequently to answer the next research question, we examine if a student's collocation patterns are associated with a established outcome of social interactions-performance in teams [19, 20] . We describe a case-study of 163 students in 53 course-related project groups over a 14-week period. On this data, we validate using statistical modeling approaches, how collocation patterns, gleaned from the WiFi network logs, explain a student's performance in a project intensive course. This case study serves to demonstrate the social signals contained in large-scale longitudinal collocation dataset as well as describe a specific application to understand group-activities on campus. Additionally, we present preliminary explorations on the same data to showcase other application scenarios where this collocation information can be used to inform and support academic experiences.",

One of the ways these behaviors manifest is when people in the same physical space take mutually-oriented actions [52] . In situated communities such as college campuses, a student's social interactions with their peers can be important to describe the academic experiences of students, such as motivation [20, 66] , absenteeism [64] , and social isolation [19] . Indeed, these interactions also share a relationship with a student's academic performance [19, 20] . As a result, understanding how students socially interact can help campus stakeholders gain valuable insights to support academic outcomes and support flourishing. However, traditional survey based approaches are limited in representing these dynamic behaviors at a fine temporal and spatil grannularity, that is scalable at the community level. This motivates us to gain an objective insight into social interactions using unobtrusive and automated methods that can be practically deployed at scale.",

This motivates us to study how meaningful signals of social interactions can be inferred by unobtrusively sensing collocation among related individuals. Particularly, this paper adopts the definition for social interactions as described by Rummel [52] : \"...acts, actions, or practices of two or more people mutually oriented towards each other's selves...\". These interactions cannot be determined by physical distance alone [52] . People could walk through crowds without socially acting on each other. People could also be sitting quietly in a room but still socially interacting [45] . Rummel's definition refers to people regulating their actions based on others sharing mutual intent, with the purpose of shaping their subjective experience [52] . Although these interactions can take place digitally, this paper focuses on synchronous social interactions in the physical world, i.e., the people interacting are in proximity.",

Therefore, the interactions of an individual with others can facilitate coping with negative events [57] . In fact, these interactions can also be indicative of greater satisfaction [19] and self-actualization [20] . In the context of student life, these factors often contribute to determining student performance. For instance, the lack of social interactions is related to absenteeism [64] , the habitual absence associated with low motivation. At the workplace, the social interactions of an individual also explain their embeddedness, which has been shown to describe the propensity to perform [66] . And more explicitly, interactions foster collaborations, which are positive for performance [3] . Therefore, reduced interactions, or a complete lack of them, not only affects a student's mental health but also impact their academic outcomes.",

Alternatively, enterprise solutions with fingerprinting and trilateration capabilities at the infrastructure-side have emerged [42, 47] . To infer location, these technologies store the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values for any client-device within a neighborhood of Access Points (APs). Yet, a common form of WiFi infrastructure deployment in university campuses [16, 71] only stores association logs describing which AP a client-device is connected to. Although it is relatively coarse [39] , this parsimonious representation of location has been exploited to understand individual behavior. Ware et al., have inferred student location based on network logs to assist depression screening by inferring individual dwelling behaviors (e.g., duration, entropy, and rhythms) [71] . Similarly, Eldaw et al., have used unsupervised methods on similar logs to understand how the pattern of student visits can explain the semantic purpose of certain campus spaces [16] . While these works trace individual dwelling patterns across campus, they do not explicitly assess if specific groups of students were interacting. This paper is motivated by these ideas to use network association logs and extend it to identifying periods when multiple individuals are collocated for meaningful social interactions.",

Although singular instances of collocation might be contaminated with spurious events of co-presence where individuals did not interact, by gleaning the right information from such data we can predict social-interaction based outcomes. For instance, prior work has shown that the network association patterns can phenotype people into behavioral groups [37] . Even other infrastructure-based coarse location technologies, such as Bluetooth, have been used to capture social signals like synchrony within group routines [11] . While these studies implicitly associate individuals together (e.g., distinguish students by dining hall), they do not explore explicit interactions in physical spaces sufficiently.

As a testing sample, we obtained consent from 46 students at a large public university in the United States, and we then analyzed their WiFi association logs. These students belonged to two sections of a group project intensive course. Both sections were taught by the same instructor(s) and had attendance data for each lecture. We refer to these sections as \"1A\" (22 students) and \"1B\" (24 students) throughout the paper. The instructor for the course provided each consenting student's attendance and group label, along with the course lecture schedule. The institute\u00e2\u0102\u0179s IT management facility provided anonymized network log data for these students. This data was accessed at the end of the semester 1 and contains approximately 14 weeks of data, which spans 34 lectures for each section 2 . Table 1 shows an AP in room 209 of building 122S. Larger rooms, such as lecture halls, have multiple APs to increase coverage. In the logs, these APs are registered with different MAC addresses, but associated to the same room. Every entry in the log documents an SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) update in the network. Its timestamp denotes when a device associates or responds to an SNMP poll request. Therefore, the log itself indicates that a device is in the vicinity of an AP, but without information of the client RSSI this inference has a low spatial resolution. Moreover, the SNMP update is irregular because it depends on the connected device's response [61] . This is erratic because of variable connectivity settings in the device agent (e.g., the WiFi turns off when the screen is locked). The irregularity in log updates leads to a low temporal resolution. The low spatio-temporal resolution is what introduces \"coarseness\" to this data. Outside of the specific association timestamps -when a device responds to a poll or switches APs because it roams -the device is invisible in the logs. Because of this, it is non-trivial to determine the location of users between two raw log entries. This section describes a method to use this momentary log information of presence to determine sustained periods of mobility, dwelling, and consequentially collocation.",

Therefore, there is no fixed interval within which a log occurs. To reliably determine if an individual is dwelling, it is important to determine where they are between two updates. Specifically, our focus here is identifying when an individual is dwelling in the same room, i.e., in the proximity of the associated AP(s). For this we propose the following approach: (i) Determine if an Individual is Mobile -Since we knew the scheduled class time and location for the regular lectures of sections 1A and 1B, we examine the logs accumulated in the thirty minutes before and after Figure 2 depicts the instances when a student's device is logged before, during, and after the lecture times, along with the AP that captured the update for a Section 1A class held on April 5, 2019. In this analysis, we consider any entry associated with a student because less than 1% of the log entries show concurrent updates at different APs from two or more devices owned by the student. Since SNMP updates occur when a device roams, we measure the interval between two successive log entries from a user's devices that associate with different APs. Based on the 90th quantile of these intervals (233 seconds), to determine if an individual is mobile we establish the largest interval between two successive updates from different APs. (ii) Determine if an Individual is Dwelling in Place -Based on the criteria for moving, a user is considered stationary at the location of the earlier log entry when the time between two successive updates at different APs exceeds the threshold. As evident in Figure 2 , the log updates before and after class times not only are at a different AP (than that of the lecture room), but they also exhibit higher update frequency in shorter intervals. Therefore, we consider any time segment when the user is not mobile, to be when they are dwelling. Contiguous dwelling segments where the AP does not change are combined to represent longer dwelling segments. Figure 3 shows how the raw logs represented in Figure 2 can depict moving and stationary time segments.",

This will be followed by a large interval till the user returns into coverage area. This large interval needs to be distinguished from legitimate dwelling periods to avoid false positives. Based on the class dwelling time, we that find the longest interval between two successive log entries of a student present Each stack depicts where how many students of Section 1B were found to be connected to the lecture room's AP, another AP in the same building, to the campus network, or not connected at all in class was 76 minutes.

Simply considering the overlapping dwelling segments could have breaks when one of the collocated members inadvertently switches from the corresponding AP to a different one and then returns (e.g., participant 2,034 in Figure 3 ). This could occur either when they took a break or if they are in place but their device intermittently found a better connection to a different AP. Since the aim of obtaining collocation segments is to infer meaningful social interactions, we consider a liberal approach to characterize collocation. This decision aligns with Rummel's definition of social interactions, which admits interaction between individuals even when they are not within line of site, because behaviors can still be influenced [52] . When an individual takes a brief break from a meeting, for example, it does not signify the conclusion of social interactions. Therefore, instead of dissecting the collocation periods around such short lived absences, these gaps in the segments are bridged. In particular, these gaps are characterized by: (i) common members of a group between the collocation periods adjacent to the gap; and (ii) the gap containing a collocation or dwelling segment with a subset of those members. After identifying such overlapping segments, we first find the median duration of these gaps. The median in our data for such occurrences was 11m 7s. Any gaps less than this threshold are resolved by considering all members to be collocated throughout, including the break period.",

On certain lecture days, we did not find any entry for some students (including a 30 minute margin before or after). The red stacks in Figure 5 show the number of students per lecture with no log entries for section 1B. On comparing this to the attendance records, we learn that 93% of the times a student does not appear in the logs, they are actually present. One possibility is that the student either had all their devices turned off or connected to a different network (e.g,. cellular data). Every student in the sample had no WiFi log entries on at least one lecture they attended (the median was five lectures). Therefore, despite its pervasiveness, leveraging the managed network will still miss out on students who were actually present. This is irrespective of the technique applied or sophistication of logs as it is dependent on the client-side behavior. For such occurrences, the automated method cannot ascertain if a student was present or absent. As result, we exclude these student records (for that lecture) from further analysis. Accuracy. We analyze the accuracy by considering every student who connected to the network during the lecture time for each lecture. We consider a student to be in class, if any time during class they were collocated with their peers. For the lecture illustrated in Figure 3 this refers to the green segments. For every lecture this technique identifies a student to be in class, they were actually present 89% of the time-precision. We speculate, the false positives that emerge could be the result of a student missing the attendance sign-up sheet. Alternatively, for every instance when the student was present, this method infers them to be collocated 75% of the time-recall. This implies the high false negatives, as shown in Figure 6 . A false negative could occur when a student's device connects to a different AP on the network. Figure 3 denotes these as the orange segments. A device could connect to an AP that is physically further away because the signal from their closest WiFi was attenuated [31] . Therefore, this uncertainty in location could lead to missing out on students that were actually present. Although this might underestimate possible social interactions that took place, it motivates us to see what we can meaningfully learn from the interactions that we do detect correctly.",

Specifically, social interactions in teams is known to affect performance [3] . This encourages us to investigate the relationship between a group member's' performance and how they collocate with other group members (such as time invested in meetings, the regularity of group activities, and the locations of these meetings). This case study demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging raw logs for one specific application that involves social interactions-predicting the performance in project teams. In this way, it answers our research question-To what extent can WiFi-based coarse collocation represent meaningful signals of social interactions? 4.1.1 Participants. The participants were enrolled in an undergraduate design course for CS students. The course is offered every semester and is a two-semester sequence typically taken by students in their junior (3rd)",

Students in both parts are expected to collaborate on project work outside scheduled lectures. It is not generally known how often student teams meet outside of class, nor is it known how much those meetings impact team performance. The data used in the previous analysis was from sections of this same course but had lecture wise attendance records (Section 3). Recruitment. The recruitment took place in Spring 2019 in collaboration with the course instructors. Recruitment was carried out in April by physically advertising the study during the lectures and online outreach through the instructors. In addition, a large number of the students were recruited during the final demonstration expo that is attended by students of both parts. On enrolling, participants provided consent for the researchers to access their WiFi AP log data as well as their course data. The participants were assured that this is retrospective data that is already archived and the insights of our study would not impact their course outcomes. During enrollment, participants also completed an entry survey where they reported their group ID along with describing when, where, and how often they interacted with their group members face-to-face for class purposes.

The latter captures the behaviors of individuals that are oriented towards their group, such as time spent collocated with other group members. The dissociation between these features is meant to distinguish the explanatory power of the group behaviors from individual ones. This helps provide discriminant validity that coarse collocation-based features indeed captures social interactions and is not confounded by an individual's general behavior, such as the time spent at academic spaces. Table 4 summarizes the different features we extracted at a week level. We derive the individual features based on the lecture schedule and semantic labels for buildings. To craft the group features, we use the same information but compute them as both absolute duration and a relative percentage.

The meeting locations reported were at a building resolution and respondents typically indicated a primary building (e.g., learning commons) along with a potential backup (e.g., library). However, teams also expressed meetings could take place at undetermined locations on campus. Moreover, groups often provided multiple potential meeting times and places for a week. To accommodate all possibilities, this feature captures the collocations between group members that occurred during any of the reported periods. (2) Class: This segregates collocations with group members during class times. This distinguishes itself from the attendance feature by considering periods of collocation even outside the assigned lecture room. For instance in the case of Part 2 sections, the students were expected to meet among themselves during class time. And based on student reports, teams did not necessarily use all class times in a week for meetings. This feature represents this set of behaviors. (3) Other: This is a catch-all bucket to capture all other ad-hoc collocations. Only 4 groups in our study reported interacting with group members for non-academic reasons (e.g., \"lived together\"). Therefore, this category can be considered to indicate impromptu interactions motivated by course milestones or other classes in which group members are together.",

This leads to a rather large feature space given the target variable was the final score obtained at the end of the semester. Therefore, in order to reduce the feature space we calculate summary features to describe the entire semester of the individual. Specifically for each feature extracted at a week level, we compute the median, the mean and the standard deviation for the study period. These are moment statistics that quantitatively depict the distribution of that feature throughout the study period. In addition to these we also compute the approximate entropy of the feature per individual [48] . This statistic is a measure of the regularity of that feature for every individual.

Since team performance is linked to social interactions in physically collocated teams [45] , these results can delineate if patterns in coarse collocation can infer social interactions. This section describes the prediction results of the various models (described in Section 4.3.1) to explain the explanatory power of the coarse collocation features. Table 5 summarizes the results of the predictions with the best estimator for each model. The RMSE of M 0 -the arbitrary regressor -establishes a baseline to determine the goodness of the models we analyze. Any features that do not reduce the RMSE in comparison are not noticeably better than predicting the mean of the distribution. To compare the information in the features, we select only the best estimator algorithm (based on reduced RMSE) for each set of features. The RMSE of M 0 was 1.075, which can be interpreted as 1.075 standard deviation away from the true value. The smallest RMSE of M P E was 1.085 and that for M iW F was 1.068. For both of these input features, Linear Regression was the best estimator. Therefore, the modeling the peer-evaluation features shows no improvement in error-reduction and the predicted results have an insignificant correlation with the actual scores. In contrast, M iW F only produces a relatively better, yet still weak correlation of 0.12. This implies that merely processing the individual dwelling behaviors is more informative than peer-evaluation responses to predict scores in a group-project intensive course. In comparison, the best RMSE for M \u0434W F is 0.748, which uses Random Forest (a 30% improvement). Moreover, the predicted values exhibit a correlation of 0.759 with the true values. Figure 10 shows the correlation between predicted and actual final scores variables.",

            "text": "The results show that the model trained on students' collocation behaviors (M \u0434W F ) outperforms other models in predicting their final scores, in comparison to models trained on peer-evaluation responses and individual behaviors. First, we find the collocation-based behaviors are significantly better predictors than peer-evaluation scores (M P E ). While peer evaluation scores are expected to yield better correlations [15, 28, 37, 65] , the social desirability bias in manually reporting team experiences can wash out the intricacies of actual team behavior [1, 34] . These surveys expect the participants to subjectively interpret and then transform their social interactions into scores. But these students are also aware that these scores might affect the instructor's impression of their team members and possibly their score. In contrast, M \u0434W F incorporated multiple characteristics of the collocation behavior within groups over multiple weeks. These features are devoid of the subjective biases that plague self-report and other manual assessments of social interaction. Second, we find that M \u0434W F performs better than a model built on individual behaviors (M iW F ). Note that M iW F was also found to be a better model than the peer-evaluations. This already implies that dynamic offline behaviors carry explanatory power to determine academic performance. However, given the collaboration-based nature of the course in determining the final score of an individual, M iW F falls short of M \u0434W F . For instance the individual behaviors of attendance or dwelling in academic spaces were not comparable in explaining the final score. Therefore, this result indicates that features in M \u0434W F reflect more than dwelling around an AP. Arguably, in a snapshot of time, individuals could be collocated and not socially interact with each other [52] . However, by observing these behaviors over a period of time it might reveal if certain individuals are mutually oriented when in the same physical space [45, 52] . The fact that the collocation based model (M \u0434W F ) predicts the final score better than the dwelling only model (M iW F ) prides evidence that this data can indicate social interaction. Finally, to further dissect the model and understand how the collocation-based features explain the final score, we evaluate the feature importance of the selected variables. Table 6 shows the top five features in the best model, M \u0434W F with Random Forest. It is notable that four of these capture relative behaviors (e.g., percentage of time students were present in group meetings). Another noticeable aspect is that three of these features are based on the variance in collocations. These features essentially describe the consistency in collocation patterns (e.g., being collocated with the same group every week for a fixed period of time). However, given the importance scores it is evident that not one collocation behavior alone but analyzing a set of them together is what enables a strong prediction of performance. We demonstrate that collocation behaviors of group members predict performance better than individual behaviors and peer-evaluations. This exhibits that our method of determining collocation can be viably used to infer social interactions.",

The lack of social interaction, or social isolation, is linked to stress, negative affect, depression and dissatisfaction [19, 20, 57] . The presence of social interactions can uncover ties within a peer group, which can be helpful to understand individual perception and behavior. For instance, weak social ties are related to a lack of motivation to go to work or absenteeism [64] . Alternatively, strong social ties can also explain peer influence and its effect on alcohol, drug and tobacco use [9] . As a result, retrospective investigations of who a student interacts with and how these interactions evolve over a period of time can provide insights for supporting student wellbeing. Using the data from Section 4, we develop network graphs representing the collocation between pairs of individuals in the same section, shown in Figure 11 . We compute the graphs week-wise (excluding lecture times), with each edge depicting the duration of collocation between any pair of individuals. Figure 11 shows the evolution of these interaction ties between participants from Section 1B. Every node represents a participant and the color denotes project groups. Nodes that are closer illustrate individuals who spent more time collocated together. Even in the first week of class, the participants are somewhat closer to their group members than others, and this becomes more pronounced in the later weeks. However, since we consider all collocations it is evident that a participant's ties are not exclusive to their group. This makes automated methods even more valuable so as to identify these informal interactions. In some cases, members of different groups might be connected through other courses or even social circles.",

While there is a slight increase in collocation period at academic spaces towards the end of the semester, it is most notable how the interactions in residential spaces change during the midterm. This excessive collocation could indicate groups working together to collaborate on midterm milestones or simply study for exams. Another notable aspect is the decrease of collocation duration at fraternities and sororities. This might be related to fewer parties and gatherings during midterm exams.

Similarly for exiting class, we compare the latest ending time with the lecture's expected conclusion time. The median entering time is five minutes and the median exiting time is two minutes ( Figure 14) .

In Section 4.4, we show that modeling the collocation behavior of project group members can convincingly explain their final scores. In other words, signals reflecting social interaction, and its ramifications on academic outcomes, can be captured by understanding collocation. This enables instructors to provide data-driven insights to a new cohort based on actual behaviors of successful teams. However, student experiences are not limited to the classroom. Inspecting the collocation patterns inside a campus can help characterize the campus spaces in terms of their social purposes. In fact, it would be possible to trace the campus' evolving \"social blueprint\" and dynamically approximate the nature of social interactions based on when and where people were collocated (Section 5.2). This knowledge could be used to augment the static semantic labels of places. Moreover, it can help disentangle social relationships within a community. It is not uncommon for individuals to be collocated in the same space on campus. However, by studying prior collocations and its evolution, it is possible to elucidate if two students were mutually oriented to each other's actions, and thereby socially interacting [52] (Section 5.1). For example, ties at the gym are different from ties through parties. Processing these logs provides researchers an opportunity to understand social interactions on multiple dimensions which motivate new questions and applications. For instance, how do teams with prior ties work in comparison to teams of strangers [23] , or how different are the social interactions in a new class for a student from a marginalized community [49] . Essentially, the network logs are a passive source of information to gather empirical insights of social support. And in a student's life, social support can explain performance [19, 20] , drug use [9] , and even dropping out [22, 49, 64] .",

However, this dedicated section is to describe applications that are agnostic of student success and instead focus on supporting their mental wellbeing requirements. Abundant work in psychology and sociology express the importance of receiving social support, and this coping mechanism is fundamental to leading a healthy life. This data makes it possible to evaluate the changing social interactions over time, for both positive and negative outcomes. Major events on campus can impact social behaviors linked to mental wellbeing. This could either be a violent incident [5] (e.g., during a shooting) or an enforced lockdown (e.g., during a pandemic). In fact, the absence of interaction can be associated with social isolation, which in turn is related to stress, affect, and depression [19, 20, 57] . Although these kinds of analyses might be hard to justify in real-time, post-hoc analysis of these trends can provide insights to support positive trends or mitigate negative ones. For example, with the use of archival data, campus health facilities can incorporate the social interaction information for screenings. Ware et al. have already shown that similarly leveraging network logs to infer individual dwelling behaviors (e.g., duration, entropy and rhythms) can assist with depression screening [71] . In the same vein, social behaviors inferred by our method can be analyzed to predict community-scale mental wellbeing concerns and alert campus health facilities. This can help prepare responses following certain expected (e.g., exams) and unexpected (e.g., student death) events on campus.",

Social interactions, and the lack thereof, are important behaviors in the context of contagious diseases, something that has become very clear in 2020 with the Coronavirus Disease (COVID- 19) pandemic that is affecting people globally. Literature in epidemiology provides substantial evidence that social distancing helps reduce the spread of influenza [21] and coronaviruses [40] . Even though WiFi-based collocation is too coarse to determine physical contact at the spatial resolution of 6-10 feet, the behaviors that can be derived from it has applications for both reactive and proactive measures. In terms of the former, similar processing pipelines aid contact tracing by automatically assessing the likelihood of individuals at risk based on the amount of collocation they may have had with a known contagious set of individuals. Although this can have false positives, it can still render a risk-based prioritization to help with screening during highly contagious outbreaks, such as was experienced in Spring 2020, and we expect it to recur in the coming years. Using sophisticated interaction networks as we demonstrate in Section 5.1, campus health officials can look at historically-accumulated data to understand which students are associated with infected ones. This can be potentially extended to study multi-hop relationships with greater degrees of separation as well. Alternatively, similar data can be leveraged to develop and simulate proactive measures that assist campuses in resuming and continuing safe operations during a period of contagion. By modeling prior data based on congestion and pedestrian traffic (Section 5.3), it is possible to determine the specific bottlenecks on campus that should be regulated because of risk through both direct interaction and exposure to contact surfaces (e.g., door handles at exits) [6] . Even simpler solutions of applications that depict occupancy of spaces (Section 5.2) to students in real-time can help them adopt safer behaviors by avoiding interactions [18] . Policies such as instituting one-way walkways, assigned seating in classrooms, hybrid physical-remote class attendance policies to reduce student density in classrooms or other creative measures can be tested to see how much they impact risk of exposure to an individual and an entire campus community.",

In the scope of our work, the privacy concerns can be related to both the data that is collected (coarse location) as well as what it can infer (interaction with peers) and its eventual implications [35] . From the perspective of data collected, the use of the WiFi association logs is more privacy preserving in comparison to installing an application on a client device that accumulates data to a central server. Such client-based applications can be perceived as invasive not only because such agents can collect sensitive data-possibly more than what the user is aware of-but also because the aggregation can be continuous and unbounded, e.g., a campus application logs locations even beyond the campus perimeter [59] . On the other hand, infrastructure-based localization is limited only to timestamps of network associations and does not elicit anxieties related to a client-side agent leaking data from other sensors. Moreover, these approaches are also localized to the campus. However, automatic computation of where individuals are and who they interact with can be considered sensitive by campus students [50] . Therefore, when adapting such approaches to infer interactions, stakeholders need to consider approaches like differential privacy to obfuscate sensitive data [13] .",

This paper and prior work showcase the utility of social interactions and how it can be inferred unobtrusively. However, this involves a centralized observer that harnesses location data, and even when anonymous, this can be used to trivially identify individuals [26] . A predator can incisively connect certain dwelling patterns if they choose to, e.g., lecture rooms can reveal a schedule and potentially an individual. To protect against this, more data can be abstracted, i.e., the AP locations can be anonymized as well (while still retaining category, floor and relative information). Yet, it still needs to be established which people have the privileges to query for information and what the queries can be. In fact Bagdasaryan et al. have proposed a system for managing the privacy of ubiquitous computing systems that limits the use of the data itself [2] . Moreover, campuses can adapt existing policies regarding access to student records to protect data related to students' social interactions on campus.",

Since the data relies on network association logs, any individual that connects to the network effectively opts-in their data for this analysis. Choosing to not connect can be considered an unfair choice that limits a student's right to self-determine [51] . Although students already connect to other networks, it is important to understand their rationale in order to weigh the cost and benefits of opting-out of an institute managed network. Moreover, even if a student makes that decision, the fact that they will be excluded from social interaction based insights could in itself be unethical. Even though, on any given day, 90% of the students in our sample were connected to the network, the students outside coverage will be missed in applications like contact tracing and social isolation. And this missing data can have ramifications for the entire community. Even for academic performance, if instructors can use this kind of data for intervening with certain groups during midterms, those that were left out lose the opportunity of improvement. Consequently, this raises concerns of fairness and accountability, which need to be considered before incorporating such systems.",

This introduces reasonable uncertainty in determining the exact location of individuals [37, 71] . Even with a lack of precision, WiFi-based localization does have its advantages. It can be argued that such approaches (e.g., [25] ) provide greater insight into indoor mobility and dwelling than other scalable solutions like GPS [17, 29, 68 ]. Yet, indoor setups present several challenges that can lead to unexpected device associations [31] . As a result, an individual could be in a room and not be associated with the physically closest AP, but rather another AP node that found a stronger signal to the client. This creates an opportunity to deal with this noise by modeling the probability of displaced connections. Individual dwelling and collocation could be described as a probabilistic measure based on their pathway to the location. Other pieces of information that could help calibrate the modelling is incorporating the size and configuration of rooms and neighbourhood maps of the APs. Furthermore, advanced off-the-shelf methods to study archival data can be developed to make AP nodes aware of other APs visible to a client. These additional pieces of information can still be very valuable without the need of installing applications on user phones or fingerprinting the entire campus.",
