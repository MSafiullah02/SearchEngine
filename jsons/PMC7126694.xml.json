Thus, Smith et al. (1975) and Castleman et al. (1985) obtained mild clinical disease but very little postmortem evidence of pneumonia following single inoculations of conventionally reared calves, while others only obtained postmortem evidence of BRSV-pneumonia with little or no clinical disease in gnotobiotic calves (Gaddum et al., 1996; Thomas et al., 1984). When inoculating intratracheally and intranasally for four consecutive days, some authors (Ciszewski et al., 1991; Bryson et al., 1983) reproduced moderate to severe signs of respiratory disease as well as consolidated lung tissue, while others only achieved mild signs of BRSV-infection (Kimman et al., 1987; Otto et al., 1996). Thus, even when using this rather heavy inoculation regimen, reproducibility of the disease has been inconsistent. However, disease has recently been reproduced in 2\u20136-month-old calves by single aerosol inoculations with North-American field isolates of BRSV (West et al., 1999; Woolums et al., 1999).",

The pathological lesions seen after the combined aerosol and intratracheal exposure in the present study closely resembled the pathological lesions in acute BRSV-related pneumonia in the field (Bryson, 1993; Kimman et al., 1989; Pirie et al., 1981; Viuff et al., 1996); moreover, the infection progressed from the upper to the lower respiratory tract during 4\u20136 days (Viuff et al., accepted).

This model was capable of inducing clinical signs resembling natural cases of BRSV-related pneumonia in 80% of the infected conventionally reared calves, and hence mimics the field conditions closely. Consequently, it may be a valuable tool for studying the pathogenesis of BRSV-infection and for vaccine efficacy studies. Studies on these issues have been published elsewhere (Heegaard et al., 2000; Larsen et al., 1998; Larsen et al., 1999; R\u00f8ntved et al., 2000; Uttenthal et al., 2000; Viuff et al., accepted).",
