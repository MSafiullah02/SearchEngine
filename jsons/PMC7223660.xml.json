The American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma Advanced Trauma Life Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) course teaches that a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8 or lower mandates intubation for airway protection [1]. Likewise, the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) practice management guidelines (PMGs) give a level 1 recommendation for intubation for patients with a GCS of 8 [2, 3]. Indeed, real-world trauma center practice varies, and some clinicians may have an even more conservative threshold for intubation. A review of one center\u2019s indications for intubation revealed that 25% of patients were intubated for \u201caltered mental status\u201d, but had a GCS > 8 [4]. Following this, a 2012 update to the aforementioned EAST guidelines gave a level 3 recommendation for intubating patients with \u201cmoderate\u201d cognitive impairment (GCS 9\u201312) [3].",

Aside from intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), 92% of patients in this cohort had complete records. To reduce the risk of bias associated with casewise deletion, we used multiple imputation with chained equations [9]. With respect to ICU LOS, the majority of those missing values (926/934; 99.1%) were missing because the patients were noted not to have been admitted to the ICU.

Differences were expressed using Pearson\u2019s chi-squared, Student\u2019s t test, or Mann\u2013Whitney U test, as appropriate. The primary exposure variable in our analysis was ED intubation. The primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes included ICU LOS and overall hospital LOS. To explore potential bias incurred by the inclusion of direct-to-operating room patients that were not otherwise coded as intubated, we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which the mortality risk was re-examined, excluding these patients. In a sub-analysis of mortality risk, the cohort was stratified by head injury, as defined as any abbreviated injury scale (AIS) head score > 0. A sensitivity analysis was also performed for the stratification; for this analysis, we re-defined head injury as AIS > 1. Finally, as intoxication may be a factor that influences clinicians\u2019 decisions to observe patients without intubation, we performed a separate analysis, stratified by alcohol intoxication. For these purposes, intoxication was defined as a measured level above the legal limit. To control for potential confounders, regression analyses (logistic for the primary outcome and linear for the secondary outcomes) were used. Because both LOS variables had skewed distributions, we log-transformed them before using them as outcomes in our linear regression models. Furthermore, given that the likelihood of exposure (intubation) is dependent on several factors likely to be correlated with the outcome (mortality)\u2014including GCS\u2014we used inverse probability weighting to adjust for severity of illness and patient factors.",

            "text": "Inverse probability weighting (IPW) is one method of reducing confounding in observational studies. For example, severity of injury, deranged physiology, and GCS are known to be associated with the outcome of mortality but may also be associated with intubation, the exposure of interest. To mitigate this confounding, IPW uses propensity scores (PS), [10] which employ a regression analysis to estimate a patient\u2019s likelihood of exposure, to \u2018weight\u2019 each patient such that those that are less likely to be exposed contribute more \u2018weight\u2019 than those who are more likely [11]. PS and IPW can be used in a variety of ways; in inverse probability weight regression adjustment (IPWRA), a regression model is used to estimate PS (and therefore IPW = 1/PS); another regression model including several covariates as well as the PSs is fitted to estimate the strength of an association with the outcome of interest [12]. This is often expressed as an average treatment effect (ATE), which is the theoretical average of the differences between treatment and exposure outcomes for each patient. This treatment effect is unobservable at the individual level as we cannot know the outcome given the counterfactual for any given patient, but these statistical methods allow us to estimate the average effect [13].",

Furthermore, there is some literature to suggest that it may be appropriate to observe some patients with a GCS less than 8 without intubation. A small observational study, noting that many emergency department providers advocate intubation for GCS \u2264 8 in intoxicated (non-trauma) patients, reported safe management without intubation in all of the included GCS \u2264 8 patients [18]. There may be a similar cohort of trauma patients who, despite impaired cognition, may be safely managed without intubation.

This statistical method may be a helpful tool in answering a question that is inherently difficult to study.

To determine whether we were missing a significant number of patients intubated outside of the first hour, we re-examined the data for the codes listed in Table 5 in Appendix 1, timestamped for the 2nd and 3rd hours after arrival. Of the 2598 patients who did not meet our initial criteria for ED intubation, 133 (5.1%) were intubated in the ensuing two hours. This relatively small number of delayed intubations is reassuring.",

The GCS provided in the NTDB is at the time of arrival to the emergency department; we do not know whether this is the best or worst GCS for that patient, nor whether some of these patients may have received sedating medications on route. However, prehospital intubations were excluded and it seems unlikely that many non-intubated patients would have received drugs in the field. Secondly, we are not able to exclude confounding by indication as a possible reason for the association between intubation and mortality we describe. For instance, some physical findings that may be considered indications for intubation (e.g., anisocoria, vomiting with concerns for aspiration, evidence of smoke inhalation) are not captured in the data but are associated with mortality. However, as the NTDB does not contain data on indication for intubation, this a known limitation of the dataset. The fact that similar results were shown on an analysis stratified by head injury is encouraging. The 23.3% missingness rate for intoxication is also limiting, as this might be an additional confounder. Despite this limitation, we are encouraged by the similarity between the stratified and overall results.",

We do, however, believe that this data should prompt trauma providers to question the blanket recommendation that all patients with a GCS of 8 be intubated and use clinical judgement to determine which ones will benefit. Though some patients in this category will surely benefit, we have demonstrated here that for patients who have a GCS of 6\u20138, after adjustment for severity of injury, those who were observed without intubation suffered no increase in mortality risk and may have in fact been subject to a lower risk. Future directions to further elucidate the appropriate indications for intubation should include dedicated prospective studies that not only question what GCS score is the most appropriate threshold, but also investigate which other, more nuanced factors are appropriate to factor in to the decision of whether or not to intubate.",
