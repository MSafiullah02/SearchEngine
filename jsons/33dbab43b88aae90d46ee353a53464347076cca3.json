There is current uncertainty regarding the role of tracheostomy for weaning ventilated patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. This is due to a number of factors including prognosis, optimal healthcare resource utilisation, and safety of healthcare workers when performing such a high-risk aerosol-generating procedure. Methods Literature review and proposed practical guideline based on the experience of a tertiary healthcare institution with 195 critical care admissions for COVID-19 up until 4th April 2020. Results A synthesis of the current international literature and reported experience is presented with respect to prognosis, viral load and staff safety, thus leading to a pragmatic recommendation that tracheostomy is not performed until at least 14 days after endotracheal intubation in COVID-19 patients. Practical steps to minimise aerosol generation in percutaneous tracheostomy are outlined and we describe the process and framework for setting up a dedicated tracheostomy team. Conclusion In selected COVID-19 patients, there is a role for tracheostomy to aid in weaning and optimise healthcare resource utilisation. Both percutaneous and open techniques can be performed safely with careful modifications to technique and appropriate enhanced personal protective equipment. ORL-HNS surgeons can play a valuable role in forming tracheostomy teams to support critical care teams during this global pandemic.",

As of the 10th April 2020, there are currently 70,272 confirmed cases in the UK and over 1.6 million globally, with around half these total cases in Europe [1] . Current evidence from China suggests that between 9.8 and 15.2% of patients will require invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) [2] [3] [4] . On 10th April 2020, the intensive care national audit and research centre (ICNARC) published their second report on data from 3883 confirmed COVID-19 admissions to critical care in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Of these, 1689 were completed episodes with 871 deaths and 818 discharged from critical care, giving a present mortality rate of 51.6% for those requiring critical care admission [5] . As a high consequence infectious disease unit, our institution was one of the first in the UK to treat confirmed COVID-19. As of 4th April 2020, we have had 195 admissions to critical care with a mortality rate of 33.0%.",

The National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death (NCEPOD) study estimated that around 12,000 adult tracheostomies a year were performed in England, Wales and Northern Ireland for such indications in 2014 [8] . Assuming the incidence is the same across Europe (0.2/1,000) then this represents a total of around 100,000 tracheostomies per year. Approximately 70% of these are estimated to be performed by intensivists on intensive care units (ICU) using percutaneous dilatation techniques in the UK, which reflects a shift in practice since the introduction of this technique in 1985 [8] .",

The classical radiological appearances are of patchy ground glass opacification and consolidation that may affect multiple lobes and progress to diffuse and dense consolidation. Published studies so far suggest in the early stages of disease there is patchy inflammatory infiltrate, oedema and proteinaceous exudate, with one autopsy study in a patient that died of COVID-19 showing bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates and interstitial inflammatory infiltrates [9, 10] . The acute lung injury and resultant respiratory failure are responsible for the high levels of invasive mechanical ventilation required for COVID-19 patients.",

First, the prognosis of this novel disease is not yet fully understood but mortality rates for those requiring critical care are in the region of 50% [2, 5] , which is considerably higher than non-COVID viral pneumonia (22.4%) [5] . This poses a risk of performing futile procedures if a tracheostomy is considered too early. Second, the duration of detectable viral load and correlation with transmission rates during aerosol generating procedures is not yet specifically known. Evidence from China showed infection rates of 3.8% amongst healthcare personnel treating COVID-19 patients [2] but at present, the infection rate related to tracheostomy insertion is unknown. There is no evidence to support a specific technique for tracheostomy insertion in terms of minimising risk of healthcare personnel exposure to airborne droplets.",

The benefits can include offering a 'sealed' system for ongoing respiratory support. This may be preferable to primary extubation with a high risk of failure, a requirement for high-flow oxygen or non-invasive ventilation. Tracheostomy also allows a lower requirement for sedation thereby facilitating less invasive nursing care; fewer infusion pumps, and the potential for their care to be overseen by non-intensive care trained nursing staff [19] . It is well established that shortening the duration of sedation required minimises risk and duration of associated complications, including delirium, and has been shown to reduce the overall length of stay [20] .",

It was noted that in all cases PAPRs were used by the operating team [32] . Therefore, it appears that this enhanced level of PPE represents the safest possible level of protection for staff and should be mandatory when performing tracheostomy.

We recommend overinflating cuff to ensure no leak throughout the procedure (as described in ST). \u2022 We advise clamping ETT and pausing ventilation (at endexpiration) during these critical steps that are associated with increased risk of aerosol generation: changing catheter mount, repositioning ETT cuff to the level of the vocal cords, and removal of large rhino dilator. \u2022 Tracheal puncture site should be covered with a swab throughout the procedure to reduce aerosol spread.",

We could not find any evidence as to the risk related to the number of procedures performed in a single shift. With safety at the core of our team-based approach; we have initially set out that our tracheostomy team members will not work more than 1 day per week in this role, and not perform more than two tracheostomies per day. Teams will initially be operational twice a week on non-consecutive days with staff on a rotational basis to minimise exposure whilst ensuring consistency in expertise levels across the week.

Within the ORL-HNS department, current levels of expertise and experience for both percutaneous and surgical techniques were established for both consultants and senior trainees to help identify appropriate team leaders and ensure adequate skill levels. Cadaveric refresher training was provided over a 1-day session to 25 personnel from the ORL-HNS department. The team had an opportunity to practice the percutaneous technique in line with our action cards twice each. During this day, we were also able to create an instructional video to support learning and ensure our teams are well rehearsed in the COVID-19 percutaneous technique.
