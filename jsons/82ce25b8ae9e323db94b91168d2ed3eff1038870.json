This family of cytosolic viral sensors is crucial for recognition of a large number of RNA viruses [3] . These sensors distinguish virus-associated RNAs from cellular RNAs to activate downstream signaling of antiviral innate immunity driven by mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), which aggregates into filaments following activation by PRRs [4] . Filamentous MAVS serves as a platform for interaction with other proteins involved in the signaling cascade, such as tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins, which are important for MAVS signaling through TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IkB-kinase-e (IKKe), and the IkB kinase complex (IKK) [5] . TBK1/IKKe and IKK phosphorylate IRF3/IRF7 and the inhibitory subunit of NF-kB (IkBa), respectively. The transcription factors IRF3, IRF7, and NF-kB then translocate to the nucleus to induce transcription of type I IFNs (IFN-a and IFN-b). Type I IFN production drives autocrine and paracrine responses through the IFN-a/b receptor, which activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway to ultimately induce the transcription of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). These include many antiviral factors, which can inhibit viral replication in various ways [6] [7] [8] .",

RIG-I recognizes PAMPs, including short double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) containing either a 5 0 triphosphate or 5 0 diphosphate moiety that are generally unique to viral RNA [11, 12, 13 ] . Interestingly, a recent report identified RIG-I as a PRR for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), whose RNA genome is 5 0 -monophosphorylated, implicating an additional ability of RIG-I to sense 5 0 -monophosphate-containing viral RNAs [14 ] . Therefore, while canonical ligands of RIG-I have been identified, future research may uncover additional features of ligands, such as post-transcriptional RNA modifications, that allow RIG-I to distinguish self from non-self. Indeed, self-RNAs are distinguished from foreign RNAs by post-transcriptional modifications of their 5 0 triphosphate ends, which contain the RNA cap structures. These include cap0: 7-methylguanosine addition to the gamma phosphate on the 5 0 end of mRNAs; cap1: identical to cap0, with 2 0 -O-methylation of the first nucleotide following the 5 0 triphosphate; and cap2: identical to cap1, with an additional 2 0 -O-methyl group on the second nucleotide. The 2 0 -O-methylation present in cap1 is crucial for avoiding recognition by RIG-I [15 ,16 ] . In addition, 2 0 -O-methylation protects host mRNAs from sequestration by IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs), which would otherwise inhibit the translation of these proteins [17] . In fact, certain viruses including flaviviruses, coronaviruses, and alphaviruses have co-opted cellular RNA capping strategies, likely to evade detection by RLRs [18, 19] .",

            "text": "RIG-I contains several functional domains that regulate sensing of PAMPs and its subsequent activation. It is comprised of two N-terminal caspase activation and Major pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that sense RNA and DNA virus pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in the cytosol. Following RIG-I sensing of short dsRNA, this sensor is further activated through K63-linked ubiquitination by TRIM25 and RIPLET, as well as through lysine deacetylation by HDAC6. Following sensing of long dsRNA, MDA5 oligomerizes along the dsRNA. Both RIG-I and MDA5 activate signaling through the adaptor MAVS located on mitochondria, mitochondrial-associated ER membranes (MAM), and peroxisomes (perox.), leading to the activation and nuclear translocation of IRF3 and NF-kB and the production of type I IFN and ISGs. Viral DNA PAMPs are sensed by cGAS which catalyzes the production of cGAMP after binding to DNA. cGAMP then signals through the adaptor STING, located on ER membranes to activate IRF3 and NF-kB. Other viral DNA sensors in the cytosol such as DAI and IFI16 are also postulated to function through this pathway. Activation of IFI16 or AIM2 following viral DNA detection leads to inflammasome activation. recruitment domains (CARDs), followed by two tandem helicase domains (Hel1, Hel2) separated by an insertion domain (Hel2i), as well as a C-terminal repressor domain (RD) [11, 20, 21] . In resting cells, Hel2i interacts with the second CARD, keeping RIG-I in an auto-inhibited state [22, 23] . The RD inhibits self-association of RIG-I, preventing its interaction with MAVS [20] . Upon sensing viral RNA, RIG-I undergoes a conformational change, in which the RD interacts with viral RNA and the helicase domains, breaking the interaction of Hel2i with the second CARD to release the CARDs for interaction with MAVS, which also contains a CARD motif [21, 22] . Following this conformational change, both the RD and CARDs are subject to post-translational modifications (PTMs). First, the RD of RIG-I is subject to Lysine (K) 63-linked poly-ubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin ligase RIPLET [24, 25] . This promotes tripartite motifcontaining protein 25 (TRIM25) K63-linked ubiquitination of the RIG-I CARDs [26] . Mex-3 RNA Binding Family Member C (MEX3C) was recently identified as an additional essential E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates K63-linked ubiquitination on RIG-I CARDs [27] , and TRIM4 was found to enhance RIG-I signaling via K63linked ubiquitination that is redundant with TRIM25 and RIPLET [28] . Recent structural work has demonstrated that K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I stabilizes assembly of its CARDs into a helical tetramer. This tetramer of RIG-I CARDs facilitates interaction with MAVS, and nucleates MAVS filament formation [29] . Removal of specific PTMs, including lysine acetylation by histone deactylase 6 (HDAC6) and dephosphorylation of RIG-I CARDs by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), is required for full RIG-I activation [30] [31] [32] . In addition to regulation by its structure and by PTMs, RIG-I is regulated at the cell biological level. In resting cells, RIG-I is localized to the cytoplasm where it can detect PAMPs of invading viruses. However, upon activation, RIG-I interacts with various proteins, including TRIM25 and 14-3-3e, to form a translocon that facilitates RIG-I re-localization into intracellular membranes for interaction with MAVS [33, 34] . Taken together, these complex regulatory mechanisms prevent aberrant activation of RIG-I.",

MDA5 has similar structural domains to RIG-I (CARDs-helicases-RD) and also signals downstream through MAVS. However, MDA5 senses long dsRNA, which are viral replication intermediates [36, 37] . Similar to RIG-I, 2 0 -O-methylation at the 5 0 end of RNAs prevents MDA5 sensing [38] . While RIG-I recognizes the terminal end of dsRNA, MDA5 recognizes the internal duplex structure of dsRNA in a lengthdependent fashion [37] . The crystal structure of MDA5 bound to dsRNA reveals that MDA5 stacks along dsRNA, forming filamentous structures, in a head-to-tail arrangement for signaling [39] . The ATP hydrolysis activity of the helicase domains is required for MDA5 filament formation [39, 40] . These filaments expose the CARDs of MDA5 for interaction with the CARD motif of MAVS [39] . PTMs also regulate MDA5 function. Like RIG-I, PP1 dephosphorylates MDA5 CARDs, leading to MDA5 activation [32] . However, unlike RIG-I, little is known about other PTMs that may regulate MDA5 activation, such as K63-linked ubiquitination [3] . In addition, little is known about the cell biology that regulates MDA5 activation. Future studies to address these aspects of the regulation of MDA5 will be of interest.",

While it has been shown that LGP2 recognizes both dsRNA and single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), with a preference for RNA with a 5 0 triphosphate, LGP2 is not able to independently activate downstream signaling to MAVS because it lacks N-terminal CARDs required for this interaction. In addition, multiple conflicting functions have been attributed to LGP2, including negative regulation of RIG-I [41, 42] , as well as negative regulation of MDA5 [45] , and positive regulation of MDA5 [43 ,45] . Recently, LGP2 was found to regulate the binding of MDA5 to RNA and regulate MDA5 filament assembly for enhanced signaling activity [43 ] . Therefore, it seems LGP2 may serve multiple, diverse functions in response to different viruses. Further research will be required to appreciate the role and function of LGP2 in regulation of RNA virus sensing and downstream signaling.",

Considering the multitude of intracellular pathogens capable of replicating in the cytosol, the detection of their nucleic acids is imperative for cellular defense against not only viruses, but also bacterial and eukaryotic pathogens. While sensors and pathways related to detection of RNA viruses are well defined, many sensors of viral DNA have only recently been identified. The roles of many of these proteins in initiating innate immune responses to DNA are not fully understood [46] . In addition, the signaling pathways leading to the production of IFN following detection of viral DNA PAMPs are less well defined than pathways activated by detection of RNA PAMPs. Nonetheless, the past decade has produced numerous discoveries uncovering key factors in DNA-sensing pathways, referred to as the IFN-stimulatory DNA (ISD) pathway [47, 48] . A number of cytosolic DNA sensors activate this pathway to signal through stimulator of interferon genes (STING). STING binds to and is activated by cyclic dinucleotides, such as cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) [49] . Activated STING then translocates from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to perinuclear compartments, such as the Golgi, endosomes, and autophagyrelated compartments [50, 51] , which leads to its palmitoylation for signaling [52 ] . It then recruits kinases that phosphorylate IRF3 and activate signaling in a fashion similar to MAVS [53 ] . Interestingly, STING can also activate STAT6 for transcriptional induction of ISGs [54] . Ultimately, activation of STING signaling elicits type I IFN induction and similar antiviral response strategies as those seen in MAVS signaling. Thus, while cells use different sensors to detect RNA and DNA viruses, the signaling pathways ultimately converge in similar antiviral response strategies.",

            "text": "Structural studies on cGAS have provided important insights into how it recognizes DNA and synthesizes the second messenger cGAMP. cGAS is composed of an N-terminal unstructured region, followed by a nucleotidyl transferase domain, and a C-terminal male abnormal 21 domain [55] . Resting cGAS exists in a bilobal conformation, with a zinc thumb located between the lobes. cGAS binds to dsDNA via this zinc thumb, which induces a conformational change in cGAS. The catalytic pocket of cGAS is then accessible for synthesis of cGAMP [59, 62, 63] . This synthesis generates 2 0 3 0 -cGAMP, an endogenous cGAMP, which contains two unique phosphodiester bonds [59, [64] [65] [66] . Interestingly, 2 0 3 0 -cGAMP binds STING with much higher affinity than cGAMP molecules with different phosphodiester linkages, demonstrating the importance of the specific product of cGAS to activate innate immunity [66] . This production of cGAMP is essential for STING activation by cGAS, as catalytically inactive cGAS does not induce type I IFN, despite its ability to bind DNA [55] . cGAMP activates STING by inducing a conformational change after which STING dimerizes and is subject to K63linked ubiquitination by TRIM56 and TRIM32 [67, 68] . Further mechanisms governing cGAS activity, such as regulation by other PTMs, remain uncharacterized. Given its widespread or ubiquitous expression and the requirement of cGAS in the ISD pathway, future studies to uncover these regulatory mechanisms will be of importance.",

Recent findings described here have contributed to our understanding of the mechanisms used by cells to recognize infection. New discoveries in the field of cytosolic nucleic acid sensing could yield important knowledge regarding how autoimmune diseases, in which aberrant sensing leads to inflammation and self-damage, are triggered. Additionally, future research will likely elucidate novel sensors of nucleic acids, regulatory factors in antiviral signaling pathways, and strategies used by viruses to antagonize these processes. These efforts could lead to novel treatment strategies for both autoimmune diseases and viral infections.",

Additionally, IFI16 in primary human fibroblasts was dispensable for the ISD response to transfected DNA and HCMV infection. However, cGAS knockout cells did not generate an effective type I IFN response",
