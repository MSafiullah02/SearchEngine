            "text": "Ebola virus disease (EVD), caused by Ebola viruses, resulted in more than 11 500 deaths according to a recent 2018 WHO report. With mortality rates up to 90%, it is nowadays one of the most deadly infectious diseases. However, no Food and Drug Administrationapproved Ebola drugs or vaccines are available yet with the mainstay of therapy being supportive care. The high fatality rate and absence of effective treatment or vaccination make Ebola virus a category-A biothreat pathogen. Fortunately, a series of investigational countermeasures have been developed to control and prevent this global threat. This review summarizes the recent therapeutic advances and ongoing research progress from research and development to clinical trials in the development of small-molecule antiviral drugs, small-interference RNA molecules, phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers, fulllength monoclonal antibodies, and vaccines. Moreover, difficulties are highlighted in the search for effective countermeasures against EVD with additional focus on the interplay between available in silico prediction methods and their evidenced potential in antiviral drug discovery.",

The first outbreak resulted in 54 EVD cases (38 confirmed and 16 probable) and 33 deaths (overall case-fatality ratio of 61%) as of 24 July, 2018 (declared the end of this outbreak), 29 while the latter is ongoing, which includes 238 cases (203 confirmed and 35 probable) and 155 deaths resulting in a case-fatality rate of 65.1% (as of 21 October, 2018) . 30 Preclinical efforts toward specific EBOV countermeasures have been enduring for years with first treatment and vaccine clinical trials conducted during the 2013 to 2016 EBOV outbreak in West-Africa. [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] During the DRC outbreaks, the countermeasures were evaluated in West-Africa EVD outbreak and demonstrated their clinical efficacy. In addition, a small number of studies (case reports) exists for the experi countermeasures has been enduring mental use of anti-Ebola antiviral and vaccine leads. [38] [39] [40] [41] EBOV vaccine development has already been covered in previously published reviews. 34, [42] [43] [44] [45] In brief, the recent update includes the development of replication-competent rVSV-ZEBOV (rVSV) used in May-June 2018 Equateur DRC outbreak in a ring vaccination trial (Phase III; NCT03161366), which proved to be well tolerated with improved efficacy and safety. 35, 36 Currently, rVSV is being investigated along with other investigational therapeutics in the ongoing Kivu DRC outbreak (Phase II; NCT03719586). A second update includes Ad26-ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo prime-boost vaccine evidenced as safe and well tolerated. 46, 47 Both rVSV and Ad26-ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo prime-boost vaccine have been evaluated in Phases I, II, and III clinical trials. Other nonreplicating vaccines are virus-vector-based evidenced to be highly effective in non-human primates (NHPs). [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] The current study is focused on the therapeutic advancement towards EVD and the challenges encountered.",

The whole process of assembly and budding is coordinated by NP, VP24, and VP40, and enhanced by GP. 74 NP binds to the viral RNA and creates RNP complex with polymerase L and viral proteins VP24, VP30, and VP35. 75 VP30 and NP play an important role in the RNA-binding activity. 75 The multifunctional protein, VP35, suppresses host-innate immunity and has been found to be involved in transcription/replication processes together with nucleocapsid assembly. 76, 77 The interactions between these proteins (ie, NP-NP and NP-VP35) are essential to regulate the formation of the EBOV replication complex for efficient transcription/replication. Blocking this nucleocapsid formation by proteinprotein interaction inhibitors can lead to potential inhibition of EBOV. for example, VP35-derived peptide (first identified NP ligand) that specifically binds to NP, blocks NP oligomerization and causes the release of RNA from NP-RNA complex. 78, 79 Other studies identified 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid and licochalcone-A 80 to potentially disrupt the association of NP-RNA complexes, aptamers, 81 pyrrolidinone compounds, 82 and recently MCCB4 (ene-thiazolidinedione group-containing compound), 83 that specifically lead to specific VP35-NP interaction. VP24 functions as nucleocapsid maturation factor 84 and transcription/replication modulator. 85 Additionally, it has been identified as a target for protein-protein interaction inhibitors, namely for a macrocyclic peptide inhibitor VP24-KPNA5 (karyopherin \u03b15) which specifically disrupt VP24-KPNA interaction. 86 VP40 is a matrix protein which coordinates with VP24 toward viral assembly, budding, 87 and regulation of viral transcription. 88 All structural/functional features and recent advances for these crucial regulatory proteins, essential in viral messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis and genome replication, have been critically reviewed 64 and therefore constitute key targets for designing EBOV-specific drugs.",

This drug is currently in Phase III clinical trials and is being tested for different HCV genotypes. 201 Moreover, through MD simulations, identification of a trench adjacent to the active site of HIV-1 integrase has been made possible. 202 The role of the trench in ligand binding later became evident when a site-directed mutagenesis study was carried out. These findings helped in the design of potent HIV-1 integrase inhibitors with enhanced antiviral activity. A 3D structure model of major coreceptor of HIV-1, CCR5, has been constructed through the use of MD simulations. 203 Furthermore, the development of antiviral drugs against influenza virus (IFV) has also benefitted from MD simulations. Through the use of this method, a universal cavity (150cavity) adjacent to the binding site of the natural substrate has been reported with neuraminidase (NA) proteins of human 2009 pandemic H1N1, avian H5N1, and human H2N2 strains. 204 Recently, MD simulations have been used to study the molecular behavior of ZIKV NS3-helicase, both in the presence and absence of single-stranded RNA, and the potential implications for NS3-helicase activity/inhibition. 205 Recent studies have reported notable examples of MD-driven drug discovery.199 These studies prove the usefulness of MD simulation in understanding molecular interactions and the mechanism of drug binding,206,207 especially against the drugresistant viruses.206,208,209",

Andoh et al, 221 performed the all-atom MD calculation study of entire poliovirus and found rapid equilibrium exchange of water molecules across the capsid, finally concluded the capsid to function as a semipermeable membrane. The next study by Le et al, 222 less restrictive to a single target, studied drug interactions of Tamiflu and Relenza to multiple evolutionary correlated proteins. More specifically swine influenza A/H1N1, Spanish H1N1, and avian H5N1 flu N1 NAs were investigated using MD techniques for possible drug resistance mechanisms, in combination with electrostatic analysis. The research group created a molecular model of the swine influenza A/H1N1 type-I NA based on the avian H5N1 type-I NA, after which all three NAs were simulated as apoconformation and compared with its bound state with oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza). When compared with each other the simulations identified conserved and unique drug-protein interactions across all three proteins mediated by hydrogen bonds. This elucidation of key molecular interactions was used to predict mutations that could lead to drug resistance. Some advances in MD simulations More advanced nudge elastic band or catalytic MD techniques identify reaction or conformational transition paths. 223 Advanced hybrid QM/MM MD simulations have been proven extremely beneficial to gain more profound insights into the reaction mechanisms involved in the investigated biosystems. To more specifically asses which amino acids are interacting, per-residue energy decoupling has the potential to identify key interactions with the target. Many drug candidates are known to bind to less populated structures within the target's conformational space. In this view, ensemble-based docking describes a method in which the ligand is docked to multiple conformational forms a biomolecular target instead of only one. Based on the hypothesis of the influence of induced fit in enzymes, the normal-mode analysis could prove to be helpful in the elucidation of the collective motions of protein domains that underlie their conformational changes upon binding a ligand. 224 In other research, slow motions have been extracted from MD trajectories by using principal component analysis and MD simulation clustering. 225,226 The same technique might be incorporated in the elucidation of interacting amino acids of the target with the ligand of interest, as described using per-residue energy decoupling. Steered MD simulations applying predefined degrees of freedom can be used after identifying the catalytic important domain movements of the target and the relation with ligand binding. The refinement quality of postdocking complexes is generally assessed by plotting the rootmean square deviation and root-mean square fluctuation of obtained trajectories. For comparison purposes between MD-refined complex systems, binding-free energy calculations using the molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area/generalized born surface area can be incorporated in the workflow. Like these, numerous recent studies have been performed with the aid of MD simulations in search of direct antivirals 205,218,226-233 and investigating drug resistance mechanisms.226,227,[234][235][236][237] Furthermore, computational power has increased exponentially over the past 30 years with the sequential development of more powerful supercomputer units (high-performance computing). With the assumption of a continuation of Moore's law, which is reasonable given the latest advancements in computing power, a one-million-fold increase in processing power is expected. However, until quantum computing becomes a reality, a maximum level of processing power is expected due to limitations in computational resources.

In this regard, it is required to widen the prospects in the development of therapeutic agents with broadspectrum activity against filoviruses like Marburg virus, Sudan virus, or other viral pathogens. However, the drug discovery and development pipeline lead to only a small number of compounds that enter clinical trials, thus making it not just a challenging but also a timeconsuming process. Until the next outbreak, drug development efforts rely on efficacy characterization in animal models of EVD. The EBOV outbreaks have also reconfirmed the significance of the immunological basis of vaccine protection to the scientific community. This will not only help to assist the progression of vaccine candidates in development, but also vaccine efficacy can be assessed for potential outbreaks of genetically diverse strains in the coming episodes. Within the entire process from drug discovery to authorization, a great potential can be attributed to in silico methods of drug discovery and may prove beneficial at any stage in the preclinical development of drug candidates. In silico drug discovery methods have already changed the perception of drug design and development. Methods in computational chemistry, particularly MD simulations and QSPR, will significantly impact the trajectory of the drug discovery process in the pharmaceutical industry. With an increased understanding of human biology, clinical trials are expected to gain success. MD simulations, in this case, will make useful contributions in understanding the underlying molecular processes and biological functions. Through the application of QSPR modeling, improvising the ability to design better molecules is an achievable goal.

            "text": "Failure of a discovery project accounts for several reasons; notably, (i) unclear underlying mechanism of target protein, (ii) lack of leads, (iii) poor potency, (iv) lack of efficacy, (v) inappropriate druglike properties, and (vi) unexpected high animal-toxicity levels. However, the success rates of the clinical development of drugs vary distinctly. An experimental drug in Phase I clinical trials has approximately 10% chance to reach the market. 242 Inadequate efficacy of drugs accounts for two-thirds of recent Phase III clinical trial failures, half of the trials for Phase II trials and approximately 16% for Phase I trials. 242 Most drugs fail during clinical trials even though all experimental drugs enter human clinical trials based on extensive preclinical data indicating the efficacy in vivo. Moreover, experiments with Ebola strains require a BSL4 safety level, which narrows the possibilities and slows the progress in anti-EBOV drug research. The complexities of human biology, amplified by the limitations of target-based drug discovery approach 243 poses a significant challenge. The magnitude of the recent EBOV outbreak, coupled with drug discovery and development challenges has necessitated the need to explore broad-spectrum alternative strategies. Despite no current countermeasures, experimental drug and vaccine development is progressing with some in the earliest stages of product development. Repurposing drugs provide an alternative way to accelerate the process of drug design and discovery. Investigation of FDA-approved compounds in new directions opens avenues for devising a strategy against challenging diseases, in particular, EVD. Drugs gain FDA approval after rigorously being screened through a set of criteria including pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics, dosage, toxicity, safety, and efficacy. Repurposed drugs bypass Phase I of clinical trials accelerating the drug discovery process and additionally eliminating the logistic considerations like manufacturing and distribution.However, when repurposing such drugs, any unfavorable data gained from these clinical trials may not serve any purpose against the approved drug, it might cut down on the development timeline.Furthermore, studying the mechanism of action of such repurposed drugs may be difficult. Therefore, experiments specifically designed to identify the mechanism of action of repurposed compounds may provide insights into the EBOV lifecycle, and can help devise new trials against EVD pandemic. Additionally, drug resistance can also be a major clinical problem for the treatment of EBOV-infected individuals, as only a small number of mutations can drastically change the biological properties of RNA viruses,244 HIV virus,245 and influenza viruses.246 The statistical power of preclinical studies is crucial for the efficiency of clinical studies, preventing the unnecessary testing of a large number of compounds.247 A large proportion of drugs proceeding into clinical trials never showed animal efficacy which leads to a large number of useless therapeutics. 248 Moreover, the statistical power of clinical studies poses an additional challenge to enroll a sufficient number of participants in a clinical trial to demonstrate a statistically significant study. 249 EBOV-infected animal models need to be reliable enough to reflect the patient's situation. Furthermore, the overall aspects of experimental procedures and efficacy should be estimated to a higher level. 250 Additionally, pharmacokinetics properties particularly plasma half-life, are representative of drug efficacy. With the use of animal models, the importance of interspecies translation of half-life becomes more evident. In the light of recent clinical trials, although many treatment options for EVD have been proposed, there exists no FDA-approved drug yet. The genetics and immunological profile vary from one population to another. This poses a further challenge for evaluating drug safety profile in different populations. Identifying viable hits through in silico hit identification and screening is almost achievable for any target, however, hit-to-lead optimization remains cumbersome. A reasonable argument is that computational methods that accurately predict binding constants for chemically diverse compounds and large datasets, still need to be optimized. Second, ADMET properties are difficult to predict for large datasets because it is impossible to simplify them to a single molecular event. Incontrovertibly, it is the ADMET properties that cause the failure of most drug candidates. Increased attention has been paid to the pharmacokinetic properties during lead optimization. As a result, poor pharmacokinetic properties, once a major issue, today account for only 10% of clinical failures, mostly in Phase I. 251 With the joint efforts by regulatory institutions, meta-analytic analysis with controlled experimental protocols and performance can yield safe and unprecedented predictive results for human clinical trials. After the largest, most devastating Ebola outbreak (2014-2016), efforts toward EVD treatment have gained vital importance. This outbreak has highlighted an urgent need to develop an efficacious treatment that can be used to curtail future outbreaks. As a result of clinical research, numerous countermeasures have been developed including vaccines (rVSV-ZEBOV and Ad26-ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo MIRZA ET AL.",
