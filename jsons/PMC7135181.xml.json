DHF is defined by fever, haemorrhagic manifestations, thrombocytopenia and plasma leakage (pleural effusion, ascites, haemoconcentration or hypoproteinaemia) [1]. Cases are increasing in number, severity and geographic spread \u2013 there are an estimated 36 million cases of DF, 2.1 million cases of DHF and 21 000 deaths annually.

The criteria were originally developed not only for a classification of DF and DHF but also to help distinguish between dengue (or DHF) and other causes of febrile illness. The purpose of the WHO dengue classification scheme was to provide clinicians with clinical criteria to recognize severe dengue illness and a reporting system based on clinical criteria. There have been concerns that the WHO classification is not adequate in the face of the rapidly emerging dengue background; in particular, concerns that some severe disease does not meet all DHF criteria. This can be because of the disease manifestations or the need for testing (complete blood count, chest radiograph), often at multiple time points, in resource-poor areas, or the effect of intervention on test results and disease manifestation [3], [4], [5], [6].",

Politically, it may be difficult to muster the resources to address dengue if DF is seen as mild. Another problem is that there is a desire to have a classification system that meets the needs of surveillance, public health planning, early discrimination (of which dengue illness requires hospitalisation), and research studies on dengue pathogenesis. It is probably impractical to meet the objectives of all of these audiences with a single classification system.",

Although overt haemorrhage is a clinically impressive feature of disease in some cases, and evidence of a haemorrhagic tendency is a criterion for DHF, in some patients this tendency is only detectable when elicited. This can be done, for example, with the tourniquet test, a bedside test of capillary fragility in which a blood pressure cuff is applied and inflated to the midpoint between the systolic and diastolic blood pressures for 5 minutes; the test is positive if there are more than 20 petechiae per square inch. In fact, frank haemorrhage is rare in DHF and the hallmark of the disease is vascular leakage. Some have proposed renaming the disease dengue plasma (or capillary) leak syndrome. A new name could help direct and focus clinical attention on plasma leakage and perhaps lead to a reassessment of the best way(s) it can be detected and monitored. The criteria of haemorrhagic tendency and thrombocytopenia could be monitored for prognostic value but would not be required for determination of dengue plasma leak syndrome [7].",

Dengue is more poorly documented in Africa than in Asia and the Americas. Other infections such as HIV and malaria dominate in Africa and there is an assumption that dengue may not be a significant health threat [10]. DHF is rarely reported and this may be the result of relative resistance of Africans to severe dengue disease or differences in African and Asian viruses [11].

We compared the incidence of dengue disease in cohort studies amongst patients less than 20 years of age in Thailand and Cambodia with national surveillance data from the same provinces and years. The average underestimation of total and inpatient dengue cases was 8.7- and 2.6-fold in Thailand, and 9.6- and 1.4-fold in Cambodia, respectively (unpublished data).

Ae. aegypti has been notably successful in an ecological niche alongside humans. Urbanisation fosters increased Ae. aegypti through rapid human population growth that overwhelms or exceeds sanitation capabilities, resulting in breeding sites in garbage areas and water storage vessels. Increasing numbers of dengue outbreaks and circulating serotypes have been seen in normally arid regions such as Saudi Arabia [13], [14] and parts of India [15], [16]. Ironically, in Australia there is concern that the reintroduction of Ae. aegypti to more southern locations will occur in the midst of a drought because of the human response of installing large domestic water storage tanks. Modelling of habitats in the dry regions of southeast Australia has suggested that the water storage tanks could result in an expansion of the range of the vector and increase the risk of dengue transmission in these regions [17].",

Singapore has dedicated substantial resources for over 40 years to dengue prevention through Aedes control. The Aedes premises index (percentage of premises positive for Aedes breeding) has been only 1\u20132% since the 1980s [21]. This resulted in a decline in the transmission of dengue and DHF. However, it ultimately resulted in dramatically lowered herd immunity, meaning that less force of transmission is needed for disease outbreaks to occur. Ongoing virus introduction from Malaysia and other locations has resulted in epidemics of DF, particularly amongst adults, who are more likely than young children to present with symptomatic disease on first dengue infections [22]. Disease incidence increased from 4.9 cases/100 000 in 1985 to 322.5 cases/100 000 in 2005 [23].

There is substantial evidence that DHF is associated with secondary infection with a serotype different from that to which an individual has already been exposed [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32]. In addition, DHF in infants has been associated with waning levels of maternal antibodies [33], [34], [35]. The most widely accepted hypothesis for the pathogenesis of DHF in these settings is antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), in which anti-DENV IgG, either actively or passively acquired, enhances DENV infection of Fc receptor-bearing cells, resulting in an increased infected cell mass and triggering an immunological wave [34]. In addition, there is evidence in secondary infections that dengue-specific memory T cells may be reactivated by the heterologous serotype dengue infection. Expanding to high levels, T-cell effector mechanisms, including cytokine production and lysis of infected cells, could result in direct and indirect effects causing increased vascular permeability [36]. However, this latter mechanism would not contribute to the occurrence of DHF in primary infection of infants. There is also evidence that ADE may play a role not just in causing DHF but in worsening a spectrum of dengue illness [37]. ADE has been shown in vitro for a number of virus families. Amongst human pathogens, in vivo evidence for ADE has been most prominent in dengue and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections [38].",

Studies from Cuba, where there are intervals free of dengue, suggest that a longer interval between infections may increase the risk for DHF [40]. There is interest in the relative risk of DHF occurring after infection with specific sequences of serotypes. Infection with all sequences of serotype has been shown to result in DHF, except DENV-4 followed by DENV-1 and DENV-3 [39]. It is noteworthy that, in children, DENV-2 and DENV-4 are much less likely than DENV-1 and DENV-3 to present as symptomatic primary infections [41], [42]; this suggests that DENV-2 and DENV-4 often require some enhancement to be virulent.",

The front-runners are entering phase 3 trials. Because pre-existing heterotypic immunity is a risk factor for DHF, a successful vaccine must protect against all four serotypes. Vaccine-induced enhancement has been a major stumbling block in the development of flavivirus, coronavirus, paramyxovirus and lentivirus vaccines [48].
