Its leaves and roots, known as Daqingye and Banlangen, respectively, are frequently used as anti-leukemia, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory and anti-influenza agents (Kunikata et al., 2000, Mak et al., 2004, Liu et al., 2005). Many compounds have been isolated from Isatis indigotica, including indigotin, indirubin, isatin, isatan A, isatan B, trytanthrin, purin, isaindigotidione, organic acids and a variety of amino acids (Zou et al., 2005). The biological activity of indigotin and indirubin has been reported, which are used as the markers for quality control due to their unique pharmaceutical activities (Zou et al., 2005, Liau et al., 2007). The Isatis indigotica root and phenolic Chinese herbs were frequently used for the prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the SARS outbreaks in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan in 2003 (Lin et al., 2005). Recently, cleavage assays with the 3C-like protease demonstrated that IC50 values were in micromolar ranges for Isatis indigotica root extract, indigo, sinigrin, aloe emodin and hesperetin (Lin et al., 2005). It has also been shown that Isatis indigotica root could promote both humoral and cellular immune responses and would be one of the valuable candidates as a new-type of immunopotentiator on peripheral lymphocyte proliferation and serum antibody titer in chicken vaccinated with Newcastle disease vaccine (Kong et al., 2004). Furthermore, co-injection of the Isatis indigotica root extract with food and mouth disease DNA vaccine has adjuvant effect on the immune response against viral pathogens in swine (Chen et al., 2005).",

Similar to other herpes virus, PrV shows latent infection under normal condition in various nerve tissues of pigs (Yoon et al., 2006). However, there is very little literature available on the effects of Isatis indigotica on the anti-PrV of swine. In this study, a series of experiments including cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction, plaque reduction assay (PRA) and inhibition assay on viral replication, and virucidal activity assay were conducted to investigate the anti-PrV activities of Isatis indigotica root and leaves extracts prepared with different solvents. The cytotoxic effect of extracts on swine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and human leukemia cell line (HL-60) was also evaluated.",

These extracts were coded as RM and LM, respectively. The crude RM and LM were further fractionated with ethyl acetate (E) to obtain the soluble and insoluble parts and then concentrated by rotary evaporator at 40 \u00b0C. The soluble and insoluble parts of the crude RM were coded as RE (8 g) and RD (6.5 g). The soluble and insoluble parts of the crude LM were coded as LE (2.1 g) and LD (3.2 g). These extracts were diluted with DMSO to be 100 mg/ml and filtrated by 0.22 \u03bcm filter, then stored at \u221220 \u00b0C before use. Indirubin (Fig. 1\n) was isolated from the leave extract of Isatis indigotica in our laboratory, and its purity and structure were confirmed by HPLC, and ESI-mass spectrometry as our previous report (Liau et al., 2007).",

The extracts posed less protective effect on cells than that of extracts co-incubated with PrV during infection. This result indicated that extracts of LE and RE had better inhibition on the initial stage of PrV infection before the attachment of the virus to the cells. Furthermore, LM and LE extracts displayed significantly virucidal activities by reducing the residual virus infectivity to cells.",

Some low polarity components were not found in the chromatogram of the aqueous extract. For this, the virucidal effect of LM and LE extracts might be better than that of water extracts of Isatis indigotica and indirubin. In our recent study, there was an 85% decrease for indigo content, which is perhaps due to the isomerization of indigo to indirubin during drying (Liau et al., 2007). In contrast, more indirubin was found and increased fourfolds in the dried leaves than in the fresh leaves. The findings from our research indicated that the amounts of the three components of tryptanthrin, indigo and indirubin in the roots Banlangen are much smaller than those in the leaves Daqingye (Liau et al., 2007).",
