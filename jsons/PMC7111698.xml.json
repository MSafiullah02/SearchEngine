She was not speaking or responding to interviewer's questions, so history was obtained from relatives. They reported her as experiencing progressive difficulty in performing activities of daily living and not attending to personal hygiene. In addition, she was refusing oral intake. There was no recent history of fever, apparent infection, or vaccinations. She had become pregnant several weeks prior and had spoken to her family about planning to terminate the pregnancy. A previous pregnancy, labor, and delivery were uncomplicated. The medical history otherwise revealed no psychiatric diagnoses or medical illnesses, and her parents knew of no other current health concerns. She had no known allergies and was not taking any medications. The patient was a smoker and had been using marijuana and cocaine. There was a family history of schizophrenia in one relative.",

She did not follow commands or visually track movement about the room. Cranial nerve examination was unremarkable, including a normal oculocephalic reflex with full nuclear eye movements. Assessment of the motor system was normal without waxy flexibility. Painful stimuli resulted in withdrawal of all extremities without focal weakness. Deep tendon reflexes were symmetrical and plantar responses were flexor. A complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel were within normal ranges. Her toxicology screen result was negative. An intrauterine pregnancy of 6 weeks gestation was confirmed by abdominal ultrasound. The patient was considered nondecisional.

Vigorous treatment for a potential infectious process is recommended, whereas anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating pharmacotherapies are the primary interventions for ADEM.11 Corticosteroids and IVIg may shorten the duration and severity of illness or halt disease progression. Plasmapheresis may be offered with or without immunosuppressive agents, but usually in cases resistant to steroids.11 Supportive measures, including physical therapy and skin care, are provided on a routine basis. Surviving patients may exhibit slow, partial recoveries over several months, whereas others might retain permanent neurological deficits, persistent psychiatric symptoms, and residual cognitive impairments.7\n",

            "text": "Pregnancy is associated with a reduced inflammatory response due to increased levels of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant cytokines which prevent fetal rejection and promote passive transfer of antibodies to the fetus.17 These hormonally-induced alterations are essential to support a successful full-term pregnancy. This may explain the decreased frequency of relapses in a related demyelinating disease, multiple sclerosis, during pregnancy.17 In a retrospective study of multiple sclerosis patients, higher parity was associated with a reduced risk of a first demyelinating event, with a 49% reduction in risk during each subsequent pregnancy.18 This stands in contrast to our case, in which a multiparous patient experienced her first demyelinating event. However, women with radiologically-identified, asymptomatic multiple sclerosis who then became pregnant were more likely to develop new MRI-documented pathology. This suggests that pregnancy may activate disease in presymptomatic individuals.19 It is possible that our patient had asymptomatic pathology that became evident during and exacerbated by pregnancy, but it is impossible to conclude this without premorbid brain imaging for comparison. Another explanation includes her compromised immunity while being pregnant, which can lead to increasing severity of infectious diseases.20 For example, morbidity from influenza can increase during pregnancy, which might have predisposed her to a possible virally-induced ADEM. Alternatively, a direct immune-mediated response to the fetus may have triggered the ADEM; this is supported by the beginning of recovery after pregnancy termination in our vignette. Determining whether a causal relationship exists is not possible, because the natural course of this disease and its potential response to immunotherapies tend toward recovery over a similar time period.",
