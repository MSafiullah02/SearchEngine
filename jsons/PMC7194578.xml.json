The predominant pattern is of varying degrees of interstitial syndrome and alveolar consolidation, the degree of which is correlated with the severity of the lung injury. COVID-19 lung lesions usually involved the subpleural area, thus abnormalities could be identified easily on lung ultrasound.6 In rare cases, the lung lesions only affect deep lung tissues and could not be diagnosed by lung ultrasound and chest CT should be reserved for these cases when ultrasonography cannot answer the clinical question.",

Multiple discontinuous or continuous fused B lines (waterfall sign) under the pleural line were visible or diffused B lines (white lung sign), and the A lines disappeared. Compared with the B lines caused by cardiogenic pulmonary edema, the B lines here were more likely to be fused and fixed.8 The B lines had blurred edges and no bifurcation signs. The origination point of the subpleural lesion was more obtuse (convex array probe) compared with that of B lines of pulmonary edema. High frequency ultrasound could further show that the pleural line was unsmooth, rough, and interrupted mainly due to the decreased gas content and sound wave reflection in the subpleural alveoli and interstitial lesions.",

Real-time ultrasound-guided spinal or epidural anesthesia should be performed if possible due to its high success rate.23 Attempts should be made to choose the block that is least likely to interfere with respiratory function. In other words, axillary or infraclavicular brachial plexus block should be chosen over supraclavicular brachial plexus block, and superior trunk block or other alternatives are preferred over interscalene block.21 Ultrasound guidance makes these peripheral nerve blocks safer, easier and quicker. (Figure 2) In addition, these blocks should be performed with ultrasound guidance to reduce the risk of local anesthetic systemic toxicity. It may be advisable to choose a block that does not require patient repositioning over those that require repositioning if appropriate. Ultrasound guided transverse abdominis plane block, ilioinguinal block may provide excellent postoperative analgesia in respiratory compromised COVID-19 patients.21\n,\n24\n",
