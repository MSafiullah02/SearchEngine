The main aetiological agents for this disease are viruses including influenza, rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, coronavirus and respiratory syncytial virus\n1, 2 while some bacteria including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Bordetella pertussis account for about 10% of cases.3 Cigarette smoking, air pollution, occupational exposure to dust particles, irritants, fumes, polluted air particles and biomass fuels may also cause bronchitis.4 Bronchitis is slowly progressive and largely irreversible disease with clinical signs and symptoms like sore throat, runny nose, airway obstruction, tiredness, sensation of tightness, burning or dull pain in the chest under the breast bone, shortness of breath, fever, sputum production and sputum tenacity.5 According to World Health Organization report, respiratory tract infections are foremost cause of deaths among all contagious disease.6 Viral diseases are life\u2010threatening diseases with high degree of complications to the humans because of its rapid outbreak throughout the developing world.7, 8, 9 Treatment of viral diseases is great challenge for the peoples even today because of different reasons like easily adaptations of virus, emergence of resistant viral pathogens, development of new viral strains, high cost and side effects of medicine, and host resistance to antiviral drugs.10, 11 Antibiotics are ineffective against viral infections because viral envelope and set of replicating machinery are completely different than that of bacteria.3 The common treatment for viral diseases includes antiviral drugs that do not destroy their target pathogen; instead, they inhibit their development, shorten infection and help prevent complications.12 Bacteria involved in causing bronchitis have also shown resistance against commonly used antibiotics (azithromycin, clarithromycin, tosufloxacin, minocycline, rifamycins and telithromycin) against respiratory tract infections.13, 14 In recent years, emergence of resistant potential of viral and bacterial pathogens against commonly used drugs particularly for respiratory tract infections has increased, which is a major public health problem and great hurdle in the treatment of these diseases.12, 15 Generally, resistance of viral pathogens to chemotherapy has been shown in immune\u2010compromised individuals.16, 17 The pathogenic resistance patterns and high cost of antiviral drugs encourage the use of medicinal plants all over the world.18\n",

Plant databases such as \u2018Tropicos\u2019 and \u2018The Plant List\u2019 (http://www.theplantlist.org) were searched for plant accepted names, synonyms and families.25 Total 87 articles were reviewed for this study, which were mostly published in English. We selected only those articles, in which complete information was given regarding the traditional use of medicinal plants in the Himalayan region and their antiviral activity. Two tables were developed using Microsoft Excel 2007 and Microsoft Word 2007. Table 1 contains information on the ethnomedicinal uses of selected plants used to treat bronchitis in the Himalayan region including information such as plant name, family, local name, habit, part used, study area and recipe formulation. Table 2 consisted of antiviral activity of plant extracts, concentration (\u03bcg/ml), inhibition (%) and active compounds tested against viral pathogens. Chemical structures of compounds were drawn using ChemDraw software (CambridgeSoft\\ChemOffice2004\\ChemDraw).",

            "text": "The Himalayan region is considered to be the rich source of medicinal plants. Local peoples have strong traditional beliefs regarding high efficacy of ethnomedicinal plants used to treat bronchitis. Traditional healers believe that ethnomedicinal plants are more effective with fewer side effects as compared to modern allopathic drugs. Present review shows that 38 families are being used in the Himalayan belt across the different countries. Most of studies related to traditional uses have been carried out in India while rarely from Pakistan, China and Nepal due to less availability of published data (Table 1). Possible reasons for the high availability of ethnomedicinal data from India are; medicinal plants from India have been reported to be very useful in curing various human ailments including bronchitis, rich medicinal plants diversity as Himalaya region is mostly covered by India,26 most popular traditional systems of this country like Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani, strong traditional believe and dependency of local community on medicinal plants for curing diseases.26 The most widely used plant families for the treatment of bronchitis in the Himalayan region are Leguminosae (six plants), Lamiaceae (five plants) and Asteraceae (four plants). High number of medicinal plants in these families might be due to their higher abundance in the study area, presence of most active secondary metabolites like flavonoids in the Leguminosae27; monoterpenoids, flavonoids and triterpenoids of Lamiaceae28; and sesquiterpene lactones in the Asteraceae.29 Plants belonging to these families are not only used to treat bronchitis but also for many other human diseases in the Himalayan region.30, 31, 32 These families are not only preferred in the Himalayan region but in other countries as well for medicinal purposes due to antimicrobial activity of their plants.33, 34 Medicinal plants used to treat bronchitis in the Himalayan region are mostly herbs (58%) as compared to shrubs (24%) and trees (18%) because they are easily collected, their higher abundance and efficacy against different human pathogens and popularity in traditional medicine system.35, 36 Mostly whole plants are used traditionally in recipe formation to treat bronchitis, which is major threat to the conservation status of these medicinal plants. Almost all plant parts are found to have antiviral activity but most preferred plant parts used are leaves, roots, bark and flowers (Table 1). Different additives like water, sugar and honey are used in the recipe formation in order to reduce the bitter taste of plants as well as to reduce their toxic effects.37, 38 Mixture of some plants is also used for recipes formulation in order to increase their efficacy due to synergistic effect of various compounds in these plants.39, 40 As an example, leaves and seed extract of Cannabis sativa with pepper, cumin seeds and cardamom are given orally to treat bronchitis (Table 1). Powder, infusion, decoction and extract are common techniques for recipe formation in the Himalayan region. The most preferred techniques are decoction and extract in the study area that might be due to their easy administration or efficacy of dissolved bioactive compounds in extract.",

            "text": "\nJusticia adhatoda is a well\u2010known plant in Ayurvedic and Unani medicine, a shrub which is widespread throughout the tropical regions of south\u2010east Asia. Leaves of this plant have been used extensively for the treatment of respiratory disorders. Simultaneous assay of leaves showed 33% reduction at a concentration of 10 000 \u03bcg/ml in aqueous extract and 16.67% reduction was observed from 1000 \u03bcg/ml to 5000 \u03bcg/ml, whereas 100% reduction was observed in methanolic extract at a concentration of 10 000 \u03bcg/ml. As the concentration decreased, inhibition also found to be decreased from 33.34% at 1 mg/ml to 16.67% at 5000 \u03bcg/ml. These data suggest that aqueous and methanolic extracts may directly interfere with protein envelope of viruses and not with sialic acid receptor at the cell surface. Only methanolic extract inhibited influenza virus infection by blocking viral attachment and inhibiting viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein. Vasicine alkaloids have been isolated from leaves, with percentage composition of 0.026% in methanol and 0.023% in aqueous extract which may be responsible for activity.50\n",

In\u2010vitro antiviral activity of these compounds has been checked against three types of human adenovirus at different concentrations. Although all compounds showed similar inhibition against adenovirus, but chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid had shown 50% inhibition against adenovirus at minimum concentration of about 13.3 and 14.2 \u03bcg/ml, respectively (Table 2). The strong antiviral activity of phenolic compounds might be correlated with the presence of two hydroxyl groups on chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid than ferulic acid and p\u2010coumaric acid with only one hydroxyl group. Phenolic compounds found effective for their antiviral activity not only against adenoviruses but also against many other viral pathogens.10, 46 Many bioactive chemical classes like flavonoids, triterpenes, sesquiterpenes, phenolic and benzoic compounds isolated from many other plants have been investigated for their antiviral activity.10, 15, 28, 47, 51 Toxicological studies showed no toxicity of methanolic extract with doses up 2 g/kg body weight in an acute toxicity assay. Contrary to this result, another study suggested that oral administration of an aqueous extract (1000 mg/kg body weight) of leaves had shown highest reduction in the total acidity of gastric fluid in rats.54 Another study reported that oral administration of aqueous extract (2000 mg/kg) of Plantago major for total 40 days did result in mortality of model organism.52\n",

Many bioactive compounds isolated from higher plants have been checked for their antiviral activity particularly for their antirhinoviral activity.

Phenylethanoid and lignan glycosides have been isolated from methanolic extract of V. thapsus. Phytoconstituents responsible for anti\u2010influenza viral activity depend on the amount of active compounds present in the plants which alternatively depends on the geographical distribution, collected season, climatic and ecological condition at the site of plant collection. Further fractionation and separation of extract(s) may reveal potent antiviral activity from this plant. No toxicity has been observed for higher doses.53\n",

However, literature is scanty regarding recipe formulation techniques, effective dosage and side effects of the Himalayan medicinal plants used against bronchitis. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out detailed ethnomedicinal studies covering all aspects which could be helpful for the patients and researchers. In addition, more focus should be given to widely distributed plants that might lead towards extraction of novel compounds due to geographical variation. Most of the ethnomedicinal studies were reported from India, and it is highly recommended that research activity in regard to antiviral medicinal plants should also be carried out in other countries of the Himalayan region. Very few plants have been screened in vitro and in vivo against viral pathogens involved in bronchitis. It is imperative to screen unexplored plants in detail not only for their in\u2010vitro and in\u2010vivo activity but also for their phytochemistry, toxicology and mechanism of actions.",
