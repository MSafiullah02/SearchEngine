            "text": "Although previously known human CoVs account for 30% of common colds, little attention has been made on these medically important viruses. It might be mainly due to the fact that infections caused by these viruses do not result in severe illness and are usually restricted to upper respiration tract. Thus, the identification of a novel CoV as the pathogen for a severe viral pneumonia was far out of the expectation of most clinical virologists. With the tremendous efforts made by colleagues from the WHO collaborative network, the etiology of SARS was confirmed within weeks. 6 First, viral RNA or seroconversion against SARS coronavirus was found in the majority of SARS patients. [3] [4] [5] By contrast, no evidence of previous exposure of this virus could be detected from healthy individuals. [3] [4] [5] Furthermore, SARS-like illness could be reproduced in experimentally infected cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis). 8 Thus, this novel virus fulfills all Koch's postulates and was confirmed to be the etiological agent of SARS in mid-April 2003. 6 CoV is an enveloped virus with a single, positive-stranded RNA genome. All CoVs have 5 major open reading frames that encode the replicase, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. These viruses can be subdivided into 3 groups. Base on antigenical and genetical studies, all previously known human coronavirus can be classified into group 1 (e.g., 229E) and group 2 (e.g., OC43). By contrast, studies on the classification of SARS-CoV yielded inconsistent results. This virus was initially shown to cross-react with group 1 coronavirus. Partial viral sequences deduced from initial studies indicated that this novel virus is genetically distinct from all previously known coronaviruses. 3-5 9-10 These findings prompted to the conclusion the SARS CoV represents a new group of CoV. However, this virus was subsequently proposed to be an early split off of the group 2 haemagglutinin-esterase protein encoding sequence. [9] [10] In addition, this virus also has some features that are similar to group 3 coroanviruses. 11 These findings suggest that this virus might be very distinct from other group 2 viruses. 12 During the SARS outbreak, several molecular and serological tests were developed for SARS diagnosis. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] early disease onset were positive in the assay. 19, 20 Some of these tests might have the potential to become point-of-care tests. 21, 22 With the experiences that we learned from these studies, we are in a better position to identify SARS patient at an early stage of disease. 23 This might allow prompt clincial management and policy marking. However. further work on developing assays with better sensitivities is a must. Standardization on RT-PCR assays and clinical samples for the test might also allow us to develop a unified protocol for SARS diagnosis. In a non-pandemic situation, suspected SARS samples should be tested with caution. In an ideal situation, serial multiple samples should be collected from patients. Positive samples should be confirmed by independent assays. In addition, to avoid having false negative results, use of assays with internal positive control should be encouraged.",

In this pilot study, evidence of SARS-like CoV infection were found in those samples collected from Himalayan palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides). 25 In particular, SARS-like viral isolates were recovered from civets. Genetic analysis of these viral RNA indicated the human and animals isolates are of 99.8% homology. These observations human virus might be a result of direct transmission from civets to humans. Subsequent serological and epidemiological studies in humans and civets confirmed this hypothesis. 26 In particular, some of the studied farms were found to be free of this virus. By contrast, a great majority of civets in wildlife markets were found to be infected with the virus. 26 These suggested that, the animals are more susceptible for SARS-CoV infection under stressful conditions. In addition, these findings also suggested that the spillover of the virus from civets to other animals and human occurred in live animal markets.",

Both epidemiological and phylogenetic studies indicated the infection of these patients was from zoonotic source. 29 In these recent cases, all patients only developed mild symptoms and did not cause secondary transmission, suggesting the animal virus is not fully adapted in humans yet. By contrast, the consequence of having laboratory acquired infection would be more alarming. 30 Escape of these human isolates occurred three times in the past few years. These accidents were all caused by human errors, and one of these accidents caused nosocomial infections.
