It is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is a single stranded enveloped RNA virus. [1] Infection occurs by the binding of the virus spike protein to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. [4] ACE 2 is found in the type II pneumocyte in the lung, which is theorized to be the main point of entry of the virus. The ACE2 Receptor is also found in the heart, where it antagonizes the effects of angiotensin 2 in diseases where neurohormonal dysregulation is present. [5] [6]. This explains the observation of various studies done, which show that most of the clinical manifestations from COVID-19 infection are respiratory in nature, although severe cardiovascular events have been reported in the literature.

Direct toxicity of the virus to cardiac myocytes, systemic inflammatory responses, destabilization of pre-existing coronary plaque and aggravated hypoxia are some of the predominating ideas behind mechanism of injury.
