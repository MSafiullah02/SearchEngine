The average specificity of all combinations was approximately 90%, and the combination of GGOs with the crazy-paving pattern and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f bilateral pulmonary distribution showed the highest specificity at 99% when three items were combined. The use of a four-item combination also resulted in 99% specificity. In conclusion, the combinations of GGO with different features from chest CT might significantly increase the specificity in the diagnosis of COVID-19. This means that in a series presenting crazy-paving patterns, air bronchograms, bilateral lower pulmonary distributions, bilateral lower pulmonary distributions and pleural distributions, as long as they appear simultaneously with GGOs on chest CT, COVID-19 should be highly suspected, even if the patient has repeated negative RT-PCR outcomes. This might help emergency physicians identify COVID-19 patients faster and more effectively. Based on accumulated experience, we recommend that these patients be quarantined and have their RT-PCR tests repeated until the average incubation ends, especially in areas with severe outbreaks.
