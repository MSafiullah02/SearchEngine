All 112 blinded samples were also treated for depletion of EP\u2010II antibodies or mock treated with influenza\u2010specific peptides, and tested in ELISA and neutralization assays. After completion of the studies, samples were unblinded and statistically analyzed based upon treatment groups or reactivity to EP\u2010I and EP\u2010II peptides. The blinded panel consisted of samples from 45 vaccinated subjects and 11 placebo subjects. Each subject was represented by two samples: one prevaccination and one postvaccination. The distribution of single\u2010positive, double\u2010positive, and double\u2010negative samples in each group (pre\u2010 and postplacebo or vaccine) is shown in Fig. 1. Within the placebo group, all preplacebo samples tested negative for both epitopes (Fig. 1A) whereas two of the postplacebo samples demonstrated low reactivity to EP\u2010I (Fig. 1B). Among the 45 prevaccine samples, six tested positive (P/N >2.0) for EP\u2010I only and four samples tested positive for both epitopes (Fig. 1C). After vaccination, reactivity against either or both epitopes increased significantly (P < 0.0002; Fig. 1D) with 30 of 45 (66.6%) samples testing positive for at least one epitope (Fig. 1D). The signal did not change for 4 of the 10 subjects that showed prevaccine reactivity to EP\u2010I or EP\u2010II, suggesting the presence of cross\u2010reactive antibodies in these samples. Using the pre\u2010 and postplacebo and the prevaccine samples (n = 67), we calculated that ELISA specificity for EP\u2010I and EP\u2010II was 82% and 94%, respectively. The frequency of samples testing positive for EP\u2010I or EP\u2010II postvaccination correlated with the dose of vaccine given during the study (Fig. 2). The percentage of seropositive samples, based upon the EP\u2010I and EP\u2010II ELISA data, was found to be 40% (6 of 15) for subjects immunized with 4 \u03bcg of HCV E1E2 with MF59C.1, 71% (10 of 14) for subjects immunized with 20 \u03bcg of E1E2 with MF59C.1, and 87% (14 of 16) for subjects immunized with 100 \u03bcg of E1E2 with MF59C.1.",

To address whether levels of EP\u2010I and EP\u2010II antibodies influence neutralization activity of sera, we treated all samples, regardless of the initial ELISA result, with EP\u2010II peptide to deplete specific antibodies. As controls, we treated all samples in parallel with influenza\u2010specific (M2) peptides. Each sample was then tested as mock treated or EP\u2010II treated in EP\u2010II ELISA. Figure 3 shows the EP\u2010II ELISA signal for mock\u2010 and EP\u2010II\u2010treated samples based upon whether the samples tested double positive (+/+; n = 22), EP\u2010II\u2010only positive (\u2212/+; n = 6), EP\u2010I\u2010only positive (+/\u2212; n = 14), or double negative (\u2212/\u2212; n = 70) in the initial ELISA independent of the treatment group. When double\u2010positive samples were treated, we observed significant decreases (P < 0.0001) in the EP\u2010II\u2010specific signals compared to the mock\u2010treated samples (Fig. 3A). We also observed significant decreases in the EP\u2010II ELISA signals (P < 0.03) for the six samples that tested positive for only EP\u2010II (Fig. 3B). The majority of the samples negative for EP\u2010II antibodies by ELISA (EP\u2010I\u2010only positive or double negative) also showed a decrease in EP\u2010II signal (Fig. 3C,D), which was found to be significant (P < 0.005) for the EP\u2010I\u2010only\u2010positive group. This could be owing to the presence of samples with low levels of EP\u2010II antibodies that were not classed as positive in our original ELISA analysis or owing to removal from the samples of background antibodies that bound to EP\u2010II with low specificity.",

When the EP\u2010II\u2010only\u2010positive samples were tested for neutralization after mock and EP\u2010II treatment, we observed slight increases in ID50 titers (up to 2.9\u2010fold) in three of six samples, although this increase was found to be nonsignificant (P > 0.25; Fig. 4B).

Although the P value was not significant for this analysis, it suggests a trend for these samples to display an increased neutralizing activity, which could, again, indicate the presence of low levels of EP\u2010II antibodies in these samples that were below the cutoff for our initial assay. All of the double\u2010negative samples (Fig. 4D) were scored as non\u2010neutralizing, with ID50 titers of 1:32, before treatment.

To exclude a role for anti\u2010HVR\u20101 antibodies in the interaction between EP\u2010I\u2010 and EP\u2010II\u2010specific antibodies, we performed neutralization assays using HCVpp carrying HCV\u20101 E1E2 proteins (accession no.: M62321) and HCVpp carrying the H77 E1E2 proteins (accession no.: AF009606). All 112 samples were tested for anti\u2010HVR1 antibodies by ELISA using a peptide specific for the HCV\u20101 sequence. The double\u2010positive group demonstrated the highest reactivity to the HVR1 peptide (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.28108/suppinfo). In general, we observed higher ID50 titers using the HCVpp system than with the HCVcc system for both the HCV\u20101 and H77 HCVpp (Fig. 5). However, using the HCVpp system, we observed a similar impact on ID50 titers when EP\u2010II antibodies were depleted from the sera regardless of whether HCV\u20101 or H77 HCVpp were used. Depleting EP\u2010II antibodies from the double\u2010positive serum samples increased ID50 titers in 16 of the 22 samples (72.7%; P = 0.0005) for HCV\u20101 HCVpp (Fig. 5A) and in 12 of 22 samples (54.5%; P = 0.0002) for H77 HCVpp (Fig. 5B). Similar to that observed for HCVcc, the ID50 titer increases were between 1.2\u2010 and 4.9\u2010fold. We observed little or no change in ID50 titers for the EP\u2010II\u2010only\u2010positive samples for both HCV\u20101 and H77 HCVpp (P = 0.63 and 0.5, respectively; Fig. 5C,D). For the EP\u2010I\u2010only\u2010positive samples, we observed slight increases in ID50 titers in 5 of 14 treated samples (Fig. 5E,F). This change was found to be significant using the HCV\u20101 HCVpp (P = 0.03), but was not significant using the H77 HCVpp (P = 0.06). Consistent with the HCVcc data, we observed no significant changes to ID50 titers for the double\u2010negative sera after EP\u2010II treatment when tested with either HCVpp variants (data not shown).",

To further assess whether levels of EP\u2010I or EP\u2010II antibodies are associated with neutralization, we analyzed the correlation between ID50 titers and antibody levels to both peptides after mock or EP\u2010II treatment for all samples classified as antibody positive for either or both epitopes. We first performed the analysis for H77\u2010containing particle, both HCVcc and HCVpp. For clarity, data are shown for the HCVcc analysis; the same analyses performed for H77 HCVpp studies returned similar results. For mock\u2010treated samples, levels of EP\u2010I and EP\u2010II did not show a significant correlation with ID50 titers (Fig. 6A,B); r2 values for both analyses were less than 0.1. However, after treatment with the EP\u2010II peptide, levels of EP\u2010I antibodies correlated significantly with ID50 titers (Fig. 6C; P < 0.0001; r2 = 0.442; Spearman's correlation coefficient: r = 0.697) whereas reduced anti\u2010EP\u2010II levels in treated samples did not correlate with higher or lower ID50 titers, despite an increase in ID50 titers in many samples (Fig. 6D). When we performed the same analysis for HCV\u20101 HCVpp, we found a significant correlation between both EP\u2010I (P = 0.01) and EP\u2010II (P = 0.0005) antibody levels and ID50 neutralization titers in mock\u2010treated samples (Fig. 7A,B). When EP\u2010II antibodies were removed, we observed a similar increase in ID50 titer correlation for EP\u2010I antibodies as that noted for H77 particles (Fig. 7C; P = 0.002; r2 = 0.26; Spearman's correlation coefficient: r = 0.594). Also, similar to that observed for H77 particles, reduced EP\u2010II antibody levels in treated samples did not correlate significantly with higher or lower ID50 titers (P = 0.739) (Fig. 7D). These data suggest that levels of EP\u2010I antibodies are a strong indicator of the neutralizing capacity of these samples only in the presence of low amounts of EP\u2010II antibodies.",

When using the H77 HCVcc and HCVpp systems, we found a lack of correlation between levels of EP\u2010II and neutralization (Fig. 6), which suggests further that antibodies to EP\u2010II induced by vaccination do not contribute greatly to the overall neutralizing activity in the samples. We did find a significant correlation between EP\u2010II antibody levels and neutralization using the HCV\u20101 HCVpp system (Fig. 7B). This could be owing to higher levels of HCV\u20101\u2010specific antibodies, such as anti\u2010HVR1 antibodies, being present in these samples with the EP\u2010II signal acting as an indicator of a better immune response to the vaccine. This correlation was no longer observed after EP\u2010II treatment (Fig. 7D). Treatment resulted in a greater number of samples with increased ID50 titers and low EP\u2010II signal, as opposed to samples with low EP\u2010II signal losing neutralizing ability. Overall, we did not find a direct correlation between anti\u2010EP\u2010II antibody levels and neutralization in any of the systems used. Therefore, we conclude that the EP\u2010II\u2010specific antibodies induced by vaccination with recombinant E1E2 proteins bind distinct residues in the 434\u2010446 region of E2, which could result in an interfering phenotype instead of a neutralizing phenotype. This is in contrast to a number of publications showing that antibodies directed at this region of E2 can inhibit viral infectivity and that residues within this region are involved in CD81 binding.14, 16, 28, 29 However, these previous studies have also shown that the functional qualities of such antibodies differ depending upon the specific epitopes recognized or critical binding residues.28, 29\n",

Interestingly, structural studies have shown that both EP\u2010II and EP\u2010I could adopt different conformations, indicating a structural flexibility of these sites on the E2 protein.41, 42, 43 This flexibility has been confirmed from crystal structures of the HCV E2,44, 45 with complex structural interactions occurring between regions downstream of the E2 N\u2010terminus encompassing the EP\u2010I and EP\u2010II regions. Part of the EP\u2010II region has been shown to form part of a conformational epitope recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies,11 and structural studies confirm that the epitope includes a portion of the CD81 receptor\u2010binding loop,44 which could account for some EP\u2010II\u2010specific antibodies exhibiting neutralizing activity.

Our data do not seem to support this mechanism given that there is no inverse correlation between levels of EP\u2010II antibody and neutralization (Figs. 6 and 7) and removal of EP\u2010II antibodies from the EP\u2010II\u2010only\u2010positive group of samples did not result in significant increases in neutralizing activity (P > 0.25; Figs. 4B and 5C,D); however, sample size was too small (n = 6) to provide sufficient statistical power. Removal of EP\u2010II antibodies did result in increased ID50 titers for a subset of samples, but when foci numbers or RLU signal were analyzed with respect to EP\u2010II\u2010antibody levels, we did not observe increased foci or RLU associated with increasing amounts of EP\u2010II (data not shown), further indicating that EP\u2010II\u2010specific antibodies induced by vaccination do not enhance viral infection.",

Induction of these antibodies was dose dependent, in that the group of patients receiving the highest dose of vaccine (100 \u03bcg) contained the highest number of double\u2010positive samples (62.5%), compared to the lowest\u2010dose group receiving 4 \u03bcg, in which only 26.7% were double positive. Through a number of analyses using samples depleted of EP\u2010II\u2010specific antibodies, we show a significant effect of these antibodies on the neutralizing activity of EP\u2010I\u2010specific antibodies in both HCVcc and HCVpp systems, supporting our previous hypothesis that antibodies to EP\u2010II can interfere with the function of antibodies to EP\u2010I. Given the cross\u2010neutralizing potential of antibodies to EP\u2010I, preventing induction of antibodies to EP\u2010II that interfere with this activity may lead to improvements in the quality and efficacy of future HCV vaccines.",
