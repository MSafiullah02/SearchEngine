The same argument may apply to other ancestrally defi ned groups; further studies in this area are necessary. Further studies are also needed to determine whether estimates informed by genetic ancestry are associated with health outcomes. The authors noted that environmental factors such as premature birth, prenatal nutrition, and socioeconomic status may also play an important role in the association between lung function and ancestry. It remains to be seen whether differences associated with race or ethnic group in the response to medications that control asthma are more tightly associated with estimates of ancestry. Although measures of individual genetic ancestry may foster the development of personalized medicine, large clinical trials and cohort studies that include assessments of genetic ancestry are needed to determine whether measures of ancestry are more useful clinically than a reliance on self-identifi ed race.",

Increased concentrations of ROS in the lungs of such patients are refl ected by elevated concentrations of oxidative stress markers in the breath, airways, lung tissue and blood. Traditionally, the measurement of these biomarkers has involved invasive procedures to procure the samples or to examine the affected compartments, to the patient's discomfort. Non-invasive approaches to measure oxidative stress have been investigated. The collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a noninvasive sampling method for real-time analysis and evaluation of oxidative stress biomarkers in the lower respiratory tract airways. The biomarkers of oxidative stress such as H 2 O 2 , F2-isoprostanes, malondialdehyde, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, antioxidants, glutathione and nitrosative stress such as nitrate/nitrite and nitrosated species can be measured in EBC. Oxidative stress biomarkers also have been measured for various antioxidants in disease prognosis. EBC is currently used as a research and diagnostic tool in free radical research, yielding information on redox disturbance and the degree and type of infl ammation in the lung. It is expected that EBC can be exploited to detect specifi c levels of biomarkers and monitor disease severity in response to treatment.",

In a large-scale, multicenter trial of patients with ARDS or ALI, higher levels of nitric oxide (NO) in urine were strongly associated with improved survival, more ventilator-free days, and decreased rates of organ failure (McClintock et al. 2007 ). The authors speculated that NO has a benefi cial effect on ALI since it scavenges oxygen free radicals that are generated during oxidative stress. Since NO increases microcirculation, it helps to better perfuse tissue beds in the lungs. The investigators offered an alternative hypothesis to explain their fi ndings: NO created inside the body may have a benefi cial effect on organs other than the lung during ALI. It might help prevent further tissue damage by improving oxygen and nutrient delivery to the tissues, while helping to decrease the amount of toxic oxygen species. The authors also speculated that NO might have antibacterial effects that could be important in infectious conditions that predispose patients to ALI.",

Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) is the main feature of asthma and is defi ned as an increase in the ease and degree of airway narrowing in response to bronchoconstrictor stimuli. It is a chronic infl ammatory disease but there is no clear defi nition of the disease and no single symptom, physical fi nding or laboratory test is diagnostic of this condition. The disease is manifested as variable airfl ow obstruction and recurrent bouts of respiratory symptoms. Allergans and viral infections induce an increased sensitivity. Little is known about the mechanisms that determine asthma development and severity and why some individuals have mild symptoms and require medication only when symptomatic whereas others have continuous symptoms despite high doses of several medications (refractory asthma). Asthma is often triggered by an allergic response and the environmental factors play an important role in manifestations of the disease. Although there is a signifi cant hereditary component, genetic studies have been diffi cult to perform and results have been diffi cult to interpret. Only a few therapeutic agents based on novel mechanisms of action have been developed over the past two decades. Asthma is a complex disease with marked heterogeneity in the clinical course and in the response to treatment. Variability in the type of airway infl ammation may underlie this heterogeneity. Despite treatment with inhaled glucocorticoids, many patients continue to have uncontrolled asthma that requires more intensive therapy. Approximately one in three patients with asthma who use inhaled glucocorticoids may not benefi t from this therapy. Biomarkers and some of the other methods for guiding therapy of asthma are described here.",

However, not all individuals respond to corticosteroids to the same extent and it would be a desirable to be able to predict the response to corticosteroid treatment. Several biomarkers have been assessed following treatment with corticosteroids including measures of lung function, peripheral blood and sputum indices of infl ammation, exhaled gases and breath condensates. The most widely examined measures in predicting a response to corticosteroids are airway hyperresponsiveness, exhaled NO (eNO) and induced sputum. Of these, sputum eosinophilia has been demonstrated to be the best predictor of a short-term response to corticosteroids. More importantly, directing treatment at normalizing the sputum eosinophil count can substantially reduce severe exacerbations. The widespread utilization of sputum induction is hampered because the procedure is relatively labor intensive. The measurement of eNO is simpler, but incorporating the assessment of NO in an asthma management strategy has not led to a reduction in exacerbation rates. The challenge now is to either simplify the measurement of a sputum eosinophilia or to identify another infl ammatory marker with a similar effi cacy as the sputum eosinophil count in predicting both the short-and long-term responses to corticosteroids.",

Blood cytokines, biomarkers of systemic infl ammation, may be a feature of increased infl ammation in severe asthma. One study found that IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 levels were higher in severe asthmatics than in mild-moderate asthmatics or in controls and, in conjunction with augmented circulating neutrophils, suggest the involvement of neutrophil-derived cytokine pattern (Silvestri et al. 2006 ) . Furthermore, in patients with severe asthma, TNF-\u03b1 level was positively correlated with both eNO and circulating neutrophil counts. Cytokine levels were elevated even though the patients were on high-dose inhaled steroids. This fi nding might refl ect the inability of these drugs to signifi cantly suppress production of this cytokine by airway cellular sources including epithelial cells and infl ammatory cells. In patients with severe asthma there may be an imbalance between IL-8 production and the blocking capacity of IL-8 autoantibodies.

ET-1 concentrations in EBC of all asthmatic patients were signifi cantly higher than in healthy volunteers. ET-1 levels were signifi cantly higher in patients with unstable asthma than in the two groups with stable disease. Thus, measurements of ET-1 in EBC may provide another useful diagnostic tool for detecting and monitoring infl ammation in patients with asthma. The release of ET-1 from bronchial epithelium through the infl uence of many infl ammatory cells essential in asthma and interactions with other cytokines, may play an important role in increase of airway infl ammation, which is observed after postexercise bronchoconstriction in asthmatic patients.",

An 89-99 % reduction in free serum IgE (i.e., IgE not bound to omalizumab) occurs soon after the administration of omalizumab, and low levels persist throughout treatment with appropriate doses. A total serum IgE level should be measured in all patients who are being considered for treatment with omalizumab, because the dose of omalizumab is determined on the basis of the IgE level and body weight (Strunk and Bloomberg 2006 ) . The dose is based on the estimated amount of the drug that is required to reduce circulating free IgE levels to less than 10 IU per milliliter.",

Various publications have described the potential of using genotyping as a tool to develop individualized patient treatment regimens for asthma to improve results and limit adverse effects of certain therapies (Lugogo et al. 2007 ) . Increased AHR to bradykinin induced by allergan exposure is due to impaired production of nitric oxide (NO), which is associated with downregulation of eNOS and upregulation of iNOS within the airway epithelium. Polymorphisms of the eNOS gene may be associated with the development of asthma but may not affect the severity of the disease. Recently, a naturally occurring gene mutation has been identifi ed encoding a member of enzymes that appear to be important in the innate immune response and is present in 5-10 % of the normal population. The mutation is a 24 base pair duplication that leads to undetectable mRNA expression in macrophages and a lack of enzyme activity. This role of this mutation has been studied in host immunity to parasitic infections. An assay for the mutation will be useful to gauge an individual's risk for developing asthma and an asthmatic's risk for developing severe asthma. With the rapid progress in the identifi cation of genes involved in various ethnic populations combined with the availability in future of well-targeted drugs, it will be possible to prescribe appropriate medicines for the genetic make-up of an individual.",

This drug works very well in those with one pattern of DNA in a gene that helps to relax muscles in a person's lungs, not at all in those with another, and moderately in the other two groups. However, the issue of whether regular use of an inhaled \u03b2 2adrenergic agonist worsens airfl ow and clinical outcomes in asthma is controversial. Retrospective studies have suggested that adverse effects occur in patients with a genetic polymorphism that results in homozygosity for arginine (Arg/Arg), rather than glycine (Gly/Gly), at amino acid residue 16 of the \u03b2 2 -adrenergic receptor. A genotype-stratifi ed, randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over trial found that over time the study participants' responses to daily doses of inhaled albuterol differed depending on which form of a specifi c gene they had inherited (Israel et al. 2004 ) . While a few weeks of regular use of albuterol improved overall asthma control in individuals with one form of the gene, stopping the drug eventually improved asthma control in those with another form of the gene. Genotype at the 16th amino acid residue of the \u03b2 2 -adrenergic receptor affected the long-term response to albuterol use.

Both the updated BODE and ADO indices accurately predicted 3-year mortality and could lend support to the prognostic assessment of patients with COPD in specialized and primary-care settings, e.g. to predict a patient's risk of dying from COPD. Such assessment enhances the targeting of treatments to individual patients.",

Idiopathic pulmonary fi brosis (IPF) is the most common and lethal form of the interstitial lung disease. There are currently no effective or approved drugs available to treat it. Diagnosis is by exclusion of other lung diseases and the only defi nite diagnosis is by lung biopsy but it carries some morbidity and mortality. Lung transplant is the only treatment option but it is available for only a small fraction of IPF patients. Emerging concepts of pathogenesis include the role of cellular senescence, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, microRNAs, and mechanotransduction. Novel variants in TOLLIP and SPPL2C are associated with IPF susceptibility and one novel variant of TOLLIP, rs5743890, is also associated with mortality (Noth et al. 2013 ) . These associations and the reduced expression of TOLLIP in patients with IPF who carry TOLLIP SNPs emphasize the importance of this gene in the disease.",

Surfactant proteins A (SP-A) and D (SP-D) belong to the collectin family and play pivotal roles in the innate immunity of the lung. Pulmonary collectins directly bind with broad specifi cities to a variety of microorganism and possess antimicrobial effects. These proteins also exhibit both infl ammatory and antiinfl ammatory functions. The collectins enhance phagocytosis of microbes by macrophages through opsonic and/or non-opsonic activities. The proteins stimulate cell surface expression of phagocytic receptors including scavenger receptor A and mannose receptor. Since the expression of SP-A and SP-D is abundant and restricted within the lung, the proteins are now clinically used as biomarkers for lung diseases. The levels of SP-A and SP-D in bronchoalveolar lavage fl uids, amniotic fl uids, tracheal aspirates and pleural effusions refl ect alterations in alveolar compartments and epithelium, and lung maturity. The determination of SP-A and SP-D in sera is a noninvasive and useful tool for understanding some pathological changes of the lung in the diseases, including pulmonary fi brosis, collagen vascular diseases complicated with interstitial lung disease, pulmona ry alveolar proteinosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome and radiation pneumonitis (Takahashi et al. 2006 ) .",
