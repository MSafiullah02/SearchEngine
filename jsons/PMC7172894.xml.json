            "text": "Rapid identification of respiratory pathogens helps to improve the management of patients in terms of preventive and curative measures (Salez et al., 2014). Today, real-time retro transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-RT-PCR) is the reference test for the detection of respiratory viruses in clinical microbiology laboratories. However, such tests still require extensive hands-on time and have an average analytical turnaround time of 3\u20134 hours. Rapid immunochromatographic tests for the detection of viral antigens have an average turnaround time of 20 min, excellent specificity (Sp), but still are hampered by limited sensitivity (Se) that necessitate to confirm negative results using a technique presenting optimal Se (Aslanzadeh et al., 2008, Falsey et al., 2005, Paulson, 2009, Zazueta-Garcia et al., 2014). The GeneXpert system (Cepheid, France) is designed for nucleic acid extraction, RT-PCR amplification, and real-time detection using a single-use disposable cartridge and an automated platform. The Cepheid Xpert\u00ae Flu/RSV XC assay allows determination of infections caused by influenza A viruses (Flu A), inclusive of both human and avian strains; influenza B viruses (Flu B); and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) within 63 min. To determine Se, Sp, positive predictive value and negative predictive values, results obtained with the Xpert\u00ae Flu/RSV XC were compared with those observed with single-plex rt-RT-PCR tests routinely used in the virology laboratory for diagnostic purpose (Duchamp et al., 2010, Kim et al., 2011, van Elden et al., 2001, van Elden et al., 2003).",

The samples positive for Flu A, RSV, and other viruses were randomly sorted from the large number of positive specimens that had been received during year 2014 for diagnostic purpose in the Virology laboratory of the Public Hospital system of Marseille. For Flu B, due to a \u201csmall\u201d number of cases observed the same year, frozen samples of the preceding year were sorted using the same approach. Dual-positive samples (tested for Flu A, Flu B, RSV, human metapneumovirus [hMPV], and rhinovirus) that were identified at the selection stage were excluded from the panel. For 6 age classes (<1 year, 1\u20134 years, 5\u201314 years, 15\u201324 years, 25\u201349 years, and >50 years), the number of patients (and sex ratio) was 99 (0.9), 66 (0.5), 27 (0.6), 11 (2.7), 15 (0.7), and 63 (2.0), respectively.",

Human parainfluenzaviruses and coronaviruses (hCoV) were tested by rt-RT-PCR with the HCoV/HPIV r-gene\u2122 kit (Argene/BioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l\u2019Etoile, France). Using a synthetic RNA control, the sensitivities of reference test for Flu A, Flu B, and RSV were determined (Ninove et al., 2011), respectively, as 6, 60, and 6 genome-copies/reaction. In 2012 and 2013, our laboratory has participated to QCMD External Quality Assurance for Flu and RSV; the tests were performed using the reference assays described in this study (Duchamp et al., 2010, Kim et al., 2011, van Elden et al., 2001, van Elden et al., 2003) and provided performances equal or better than 11/12.",
