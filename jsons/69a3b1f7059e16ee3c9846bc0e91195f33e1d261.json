Nevertheless, many phases of matter are known to admit a sign-problem-free representative, allowing efficient simulations on classical computers. Motivated by long standing open problems in many-body physics, as well as fundamental questions in quantum complexity, the possibility of intrinsic sign problems, where a phase of matter admits no signproblem-free representative, was recently raised but remains largely unexplored. Here, we establish the existence of an intrinsic sign problem in a broad class of gapped, chiral, topological phases of matter. Within this class, we exclude the possibility of stoquastic Hamiltonians for bosons (or 'qudits'), and of sign-problem-free determinantal Monte Carlo algorithms for fermions. The intrinsically sign-problematic class of phases we identify is defined in terms of topological invariants with clear observable signatures: the chiral central charge, and the topological spins of anyons. We obtain analogous results for phases that are spontaneously chiral, and present evidence for an extension of our results that applies to both chiral and non-chiral topological matter.",

These include the nature of high temperature superconductivity and the associated repulsive Hubbard model [20, [25] [26] [27] , dense nuclear matter and the associated lattice QCD at finite baryon density [28] [29] [30] , and the enigmatic fractional quantum Hall state at filling 5/2 and its associated Coulomb Hamiltonian [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] , all of which are fermionic. arXiv:2005.05566v1 [cond-mat.str-el] 12 May 2020 2 One may wonder if there is a fundamental reason that no design principle applying to the above open problems has so far been found, despite intense research efforts.

In particular, we identify an intrinsic sign problem in 96.7% of the first one-thousand fermionic Laughlin phases, and in all non-abelian Kitaev spin liquids. We also find intrinsic sign problems in 91.6% of the first one-thousand SU (2) k Chern-Simons theories. Since, for k = 1, 2, 4, these allow for universal quantum computation by manipulation of anyons [48, 49] , our results support the strong belief that quantum computation cannot be simulated with classical resources, in polynomial time [50] . This conclusion is strengthened by examining the Fibonacci anyon model, which is known to be universal for quantum computation [49] , and is found to be intrinsically sign-problematic. We stress that both c and {\u03b8 a } have clear observable signatures in both the bulk and boundary of chiral topological matter, some of which have been experimentally observed. The chiral central charge controls the boundary thermal Hall conductance [51] [52] [53] [54] , which was recently measured in quantum Hall and spin systems [31, [55] [56] [57] . In the bulk it is predicted to contribute to the Hall (or odd) viscosity at finite wave-vector, as well as in curved background [58] [59] [60] [61] . The chiral central charge also affects the angular momentum at conical defects [62] , as was recently observed in an optical realization of integer quantum Hall states [63, 64] . The topological spins determine the exchange statistics of anyons, predicted to appear in interferometry experiments [49] , though experimental observation remains elusive [65] .",

Section III then obtains Result 1 -an intrinsic sign problem in bosonic chiral topological matter. In Sec.IV we perform a similar analysis for the case where chirality (or time reversal symmetry breaking), appears spontaneously rather than explicitly, arriving at Result 2. We then turn to fermionic systems. In Sec.V we develop a formalism which unifies and generalizes the currently used DQMC algorithms, and the corresponding design principles. In Sec.VI, we obtain within this formalism Result 1F and Result 2F, the fermionic analogs of Results 1 and 2. Section VII describes a conjectured extension of our results that applies beyond chiral phases, and unifies them with the intrinsic sign problems found in our parallel work [38] . In Sec.VIII we discuss our results and provide an outlook for future work.",

Later on we will show that gapped bosonic and fermionic Hamiltonians which are sign-free (due to the an appropriate design principle) cannot obey the aforementioned Eq.(3), unless the chiral central charge and topological spins obey a tight constraint. \u2208 {\u03b8a}, in terms of the chiral central charge c and the topological spins \u03b8a = e 2\u03c0iha . We mark bosonic/fermionic phases by (B/F). The -wave superconductor is chiral, e.g p + ip for = 1, and spinless. Data for the spinfull case is identical to that of the Chern insulator, with odd (even) in place of \u03bd, for triplet (singlet) pairing. The modulo 8 ambiguity in the last line corresponds to the stacking of a given realization of the anyon model with copies of the E8 K-matrix phase. A gapped Hamiltonian is said to be in a topological phase of matter if it cannot be deformed to a trivial reference Hamiltonian, without closing the gap. If a symmetry is enforced, only symmetric deformations are considered, and it is additionally required that the symmetry is not spontaneously broken [68, 69] . For Hamiltonians defined on a lattice, as considered in this paper, a natural trivial Hamiltonian is given by the atomic limit of decoupled lattice sites, where the symmetry acts independently on each site.",

However,Z also has a simple interpretation from a space-time perspective, which will be useful in the context of DQMC. The usual partition function Z = Tr e \u2212\u03b2H has a functional integral representation in terms of bosonic fields \u03c6 (fermionic fields \u03c8) defined on space, the cylinder C in our case, and the imaginary time circle S 1 \u03b2 = R/\u03b2Z, with periodic (antiperiodic) boundary conditions [90] . InZ = Tr T R e \u2212\u03b2H , the insertion of T R produces a twisting of the boundary conditions of \u03c6, \u03c8 in the time direction, such thatZ is the partition function on a space-time carrying a screw dislocation, see Fig.2 (b). Geometrically, the space-time on which Z is defined is a fibration of C over S 1 \u03b2 , whereas Z is defined on the product C \u00d7 S 1 \u03b2 . The above space-time interpretation ofZ, supplemented by Eq.(2), allows for an intuitive explanation of Eq.(3), which loosely follows its analytic derivation [40] . As seen in Fig.2(b) , the line where T R is discontinuous can be interpreted as an additional boundary component at a high effective temperature, \u03b2 * L/v. Since the effective temperature is much larger than the finite size energy-differences 2\u03c0v/L on the boundary CFT, the screw dislocation contributes no finite size corrections toZ. This leaves only the contribution of the boundary component on the right side of the cylinder, where T R produces the phase e iaLp(L) , assuming \u03b2 * L/v \u03b2. Equation (2) then leads to the universal finite size correction (2\u03c0i/N x ) (h 0 \u2212 c/24).",

This is done by choosing a translation vector d \u2208 X, and then cutting the torus X along a line l parallel to d. The vector d is chosen such that such that T d corresponds to a translation in the low energy TQFT description. In particular, a lattice translation may permute the anyon types a 2 . Since the number of anyons is finite, using a large enough translation will eliminate this effect. An example is given by Wen's plaquette model [92] , where different anyons are placed on the even/odd sites of a bipartite lattice, and a translation that maps the even (odd) sites to themselves will be chosen. To simplify the presentation we restrict attention to the case d = (1, 0), where T d = T (and in the following T d R = T R ). All other cases amount to a lattice-spacing redefinition, see Appendix C. The cylinder C = Z Nx \u00d7 {1, . . . , N y } is then obtained from the torus X = Z Nx \u00d7 Z Ny by cutting along the line l = {(i, 1/2) : i \u2208 Z Nx }. A stoquastic Hamiltonian on the cylinder can be obtained from that on the torus by removing all local terms H x whose support overlaps l, see Fig.3 . Note that this procedure may render H acting as 0 on certain qudits H x with x within a range r of l, but this does not bother us. Since all terms H x are individually stoquastic, this procedure leaves H , now defined on the cylinder, stoquastic. One can similarly map H and U to the cylinder C such that the relation H = U HU \u2020 remains valid on C.",

In this section we develop a formalism that unifies and generalizes the currently used DQMC algorithms and design principles, and implement within it the geometric manipulations used in previous sections, in a sign-free manner. Since we wish to treat the wide range of currently known DQMC algorithms and design principles on equal footing, the discussion will be more abstract than the simple setting of locally stoquastic Hamiltonians used above. In particular, Sections V A-V B lead up to the definition of locally sign-free DQMC, which is our fermionic analog of a locally stoquastic Hamiltonian.

As discussed in Sec.IV, the breaking of P and T down to PT actually defines the notion of chirality, and therefore PT is a natural symmetry in chiral topological matter. Accordingly, the design principle T = P (0) T (1/2) applies to a class of models for chiral topological phases, see Appendix E. This seems to allow, from the naive algebraic perspective, for a sign-free DQMC simulation of certain chiral topological phases. However, the weights p (\u03c6) will only be non-negative for bosonic configurations \u03c6 which are is invariant under T = P (0) T (1/2) . Restricting the \u03c6 integration in Eq. (17) to such configurations leads to non-local interactions between fermions \u03c8, coupling the points (x, y) and (\u2212x, y). These interactions effectively fold the non-local chiral system into a local non-chiral system of half of space, see Fig.5 .

It is currently believed that many high temperature superconductors, and the associated repulsive Hubbard models, are non chiral d-wave superconductors [17, 27] , in which we did not identify an intrinsic sign problem. This leaves open the optimistic possibility that the sign problem can in fact be cured in repulsive Hubbard models, though this has not yet been done in the relevant regime of parameters, away from half filling [26] . Nevertheless, the state of the art DMRG results of Ref. [27] do not exclude the possibility of a chiral d-wave superconductor ( = \u00b12 in Table I ), in which we do find an intrinsic sign problem. There is also evidence for chiral d-wave superconductivity in doped graphene and related materials [108, 109] .

A sign problem exists when \u2206 > 0, in which case QMC simulations require exponential computational resources, and this is what the intrinsic sign problem we identified implies for 'most' chiral topological phases of matter. From the point of view of computational complexity, all that matters is whether \u2206 = 0 or \u2206 > 0, but for practical applications the value of \u2206 is very important, see e.g [108] . One may hope for a possible refinement of our results that provides a lower bound \u2206 0 > 0 for \u2206, but since we have studied topological phases of matter, we view this as unlikely.

We are left with the complementary case, where degeneracies occur for all N x \u2208 mN, i.e mN \u2282 N . Note that this case is highly fine tuned, as it ties together the nonuniversal = n/m and the set N of N x s where accidental degeneracies appear. In order to deal with this case, we make use of the Frobenius-Perron theorem to resolve the degenerate ground-state subspace, without introducing signs. The analysis applies only to the bosonic setting of Result 1, and is similar to that made in Sec.VII. We now have a Hamiltonian H on the cylinder, which has an exactly degenerate ground-state subspace for all N x \u2208 mN, and has non-positive matrix elements in the on-site homogenous basis |s . The Frobenius-Perron theorem implies that an orthonormal basis |i with non-negative entries may be chosen for the ground state subspace, s| i \u2265 0 for all s, i. It follows that the matrix elements of T R in the basis |i are non-negative, M ij := i| T R |j \u2265 0. Taking the N x th matrix power of M we have M Nx ij \u2265 0.

In particular, T ij is unitary. Since e 2\u03c0i N 2 x = 1 for all N x \u2208 mN, we see that T ij also has non-negative entires, and is therefore a permutation matrix, containing 1 in its spectrum (see Sec.VII).

In particular, the boundary degrees of freedom are now non-chiral. Thus, PT does not allow for sign-free QMC simulations of chiral topological matter.

            "text": "As stated in Sec.V C, the composition T = P (0) T (1/2) of the spin-less reflection with the spin-1/2 time-reversal, naturally provides a design-principle for a class of models for chiral topological matter. Here we describe such Tinvariant models for chiral topological superconductors.The simplest model is comprised of two copies, labeled by \u03c3 =\u2191, \u2193, of a spin-less p + ip superconductor,Herewhere d x xx (d y xx ) is the anti-symmetric x (y) difference operator,and the hopping t is real and reflection symmetric, e.g t x,x = 1 2 t (\u03b4 x,x +1 + \u03b4 x+1,x ) \u03b4 y,y + (x \u2194 y) \u2212 \u00b5, (E5) with t, \u00b5 \u2208 R. It is well known that the chemical potential \u00b5 can be used to tune the model between gapped SPT phases with c = 0, \u22121, 1, for |\u00b5| > 2, \u22122 < \u00b5 < 0, 0 < \u00b5 < 2, respectively, see e.g [89] . Additionally, the Hamiltonian is invariant under the combination of the unitary spin-less reflection P (0) : \u03c8 \u03c3,(x,y) \u2192 \u03c8 \u03c3,(x,\u2212y) and the anti-unitary spin-full timeThe model can be written in the BdG formwhere \u03a8 T x = \u03c8 \u2191x , \u03c8 \u2193x , \u03c8 \u2020 \u2191x , \u03c8 \u2020 \u2193x is the Nambu spinor (a Majorana spinor), and. The \"single-fermion\" space on which h BdG acts isThe spin-less reflection acts on H 1F as P (0) = P (0)The spin-full time-reversal acts by T (1/2) = I |X| \u2297iY \u2297I 2 K, where Y is the Pauli matrix and K is the complex conjugation. The operator T = P (0) T (1/2) satisfies T 2 = \u2212I and [T, h BdG ] = 0, and is therefore a time-reversal design principle which applies to h BdG , im-plying det (\u2202 \u03c4 + h BdG ) \u2265 0. Since h BdG acts on the Majorana spinor \u03a8, the relevant quantity is actually the Pfaffian Pf (\u2202 \u03c4 + h BdG ) = det (\u2202 \u03c4 + h BdG ) \u2265 0, where the principle branch of the square root is chosen.The Hamiltonian h BdG can be considerably generalized while maintaining [T, h BdG ] = 0, by takingwhere t x,x , r x,x are general matrices, and \u2208 2Z + 1 (\u02dc \u2208 2Z) is the angular momentum channel of the triplet (singlet) pairing.This can be further generalized to a sum over all angular momentum channels| | and similarly for\u02dc .The model is Hermitian for t = t \u2020 , r = \u2212r T , but this is not required to avoid the sign problem. In order to obtain an interacting model, the parameterscan now be promoted to space-time dependent bosonic fields, with any action S \u03c6 \u2208 R. The model will be sign-free as long as h BdG remains T-invariant for all configurations \u03c6, which requires that only reflection-even configurations \u03c6 (\u03c4, x, y) = \u03c6 (\u03c4, x, \u2212y) are summed over. As discussed in Sec.V C, this implies non-local interactions, which effectively fold the chiral system into a non-chiral system of half of space.",

The design principles are stated as algebraic conditions satisfied by the effective single-fermion Hamiltonian h \u03c6 = h \u03c6(\u03c4 ) and the corresponding imaginary-timeContraction semi-groups and Majorana time reversals The time-reversal design principle covered in Sec.V C is a special case of a broad class of design principles that were recently discovered and unified [22] [23] [24] . These are stated in terms of Majorana fermions, where \u03c8 is real and \u03c8 = \u03c8 T , in which case h \u03c6 is anti-symmetric and the determinants in (17) are replaced by their square roots. Reference [24] shows that ifwhere the matrices J 1 , J 2 are real and orthogonal, and obeyThe equality (F1) corresponds to an anti-unitary symmetrywhere K is the complex conjugation. If the inequality (F2) is replaced by an equality, it corresponds to an additional anti-unitary symmetry, T 2 = J 2 K, T 2 2 = \u2212I. The case T 2 1 = \u2212I then reduces to the standard time-reversal T described in Sec.V C, while T 2 1 = I corresponds to the 'Majorana class' of Ref. [22] . More generally, the inequality (F2) states that the left hand side is a positive semi-definite matrix, and implies that h \u03c6 is a generator of the contraction semi-group defined by the Hermitian metric \u03b7 2 = iJ 2 , \u03b7 2 2 = I, [T 1 , \u03b7 2 ] = 0. Explicitly, Eq.(F1)-(F2) can be written asand implyIn the language of Sec.V B, for fixed T 1 , \u03b7 2 , the set C h contains all matrices h \u03c6 satisfying (F3). It is clear that this set is additive: h 1 + h 2 \u2208 C h for all h 1 , h 2 \u2208 C h . The set C U contains all matrices U \u03c6 satisfying Eq.(F4), and is multiplicative:A sufficient condition on T 1 , \u03b7 2 that guarantees that the design principle they define is on-site homogenous is that they are of the form T 1 = I |X| \u2297 t 1 , \u03b7 2 = I |X| \u2297 e 2 , written in terms of the decomposition H 1F \u223c = C |X| \u2297 C dF of the single-fermion space. The permutation matrices O (\u03c3) defined in Eq.(20) then commute with \u03b7 2 and T 1 . Since O (\u03c3) are also unitary, we have O (\u03c3) \u2208 C U for all \u03c3 \u2208 S X .",

            "text": "All examples described in Refs. [22] [23] [24] are of the on-site homogenous form T 1 = I |X| \u2297 t 1 , \u03b7 2 = I |X| \u2297 e 2 .As in our discussion of T in Sec.V C, the locality of T 1 = I |X| \u2297 t 1 means that it can be applied term-wise, by symmetrizing the local terms h \u03c6;x \u2192 1 2 h \u03c6;x + T 1 h \u03c6;x T \u22121 1 . A similar procedure for \u03b7 2 is only possible if the inequality in Eq.(F3) holds as an equality (as in Ref. [22] ). The contraction semi-group defined by \u03b7 2 then reduces to an orthogonal group, and one can enforce the term-wise rela-Collecting the above, we see that if T 1 , \u03b7 2 can be brought to the form T 1 = I |X| \u2297t 1 , \u03b7 2 = I |X| \u2297e 2 by the same singlefermion local unitary u, then a DQMC representation which is T 1 -symmetric, and respects Eq.(F3) terms-wise, leads to a locally-sign free DQMC simulation.Split orthogonal group Another recently discovered design principle is defined in terms of the split orthogonal group O (n, n) [18] : if U \u03c6 \u2208 O (n, n), then the sign of Det (I + U \u03c6 ) depends only on the connected component of O (n, n) to which U \u03c6 belongs. If the sign of e \u2212S \u03c6 is manifestly compatible with the connected component of U \u03c6 in O (n, n), one has p (\u03c6) = e \u2212S \u03c6 Det (I + U \u03c6 ) \u2265 0. More explicitly, the statement U \u03c6 \u2208 O (n, n) implies that U \u03c6 is a real matrix and \u03b7 \u2212 U T \u03c6 \u03b7U \u03c6 = 0, where \u03b7 = diag (I n , \u2212I n ). Restricting to the identity component O 0 (n, n), this amounts to the statements that h \u03c6 is in the Lie algebra o (n, n): it is real and satisfies \u03b7h \u03c6 + h T \u03c6 \u03b7 = 0. In a basis independent formulation, the data that defines the design principle is an anti-unitaryT, such thatT 2 = I, and a Hermitian metric\u03b7 with canonical form \u03b7, such that T ,\u03b7 = 0. The set C h is then given by matrices h \u03c6 satisfyingwhile C U is defined byThe analogy with (F3)-(F4) is now manifest, with the inequalities strengthened to equalities. Accordingly, the O (n, n) design-principle is on-site homogeneous ifT = I |X| \u2297t and\u03b7 = I |X| \u2297\u1ebd. If these forms can be obtained by conjugation ofT,\u03b7 with the same single-fermion local unitary u, then a DQMC representation which is sign-free due toT,\u03b7, leads to a locally-sign free DQMC simulation.The above statements hold for U \u03c6 in the identity component O 0 (n, n), which is always the case when h \u03c6 \u2208 o (n, n) and U \u03c6 = TOe \u2212 \u03b2 0 h \u03c6(\u03c4 ) d\u03c4 . Time evolutions in the additional three connected components of O (n, n) can be obtained by operator insertions generalizing [18] . These can be incorporated into the frame-work of Sec.V, if each O k is supported on a disk of radius w around a siteWith this generalization, all sign-free examples described in Ref. [18] amount to locally sign-free DQMC.Solvable fermionic and bosonic actions Reference [21] described a design principle that nontrivially relates the fermionic action S \u03c8,\u03c6 = \u03c8D \u03c6 \u03c8 and bosonic action S \u03c6 . A fermionic action was termed 'solvable' if D \u03c6 has the formwhich clearly implies Det (D \u03c6 ) = |Det (M \u03c6 )| 2 \u2265 0. Here the imaginary time circle R/\u03b2Z is discretized to Z \u03b2 = Z/\u03b2Z, and D \u03c6 is treated as a matrix on C \u03b2 \u00d7 H 1F = C \u03b2 \u00d7 C |X| \u00d7 C d F , with indices (\u03c4, x, \u03b1) , (\u03c4 , x , \u03b1 ) for time, space, and internal degrees of freedom. For example, the Hamiltonian formIn a basis independent language, Eq.(F7) corresponds towhere \u0393 is a 'chiral symmetry', \u0393 2 = I, \u0393 = \u0393 \u2020 . Eq. (19) is then obtained in a basis where is diagonal, \u0393 = diag (I, \u2212I).Note however that \u0393 acts on D \u03c6 rather than h \u03c6 , and that the form (F7) requires a non-canonical transformation away from the Hamiltonian form (F8). We refer to \u0393 as on-site homogeneous if it is of the form \u0393 = I \u03b2 \u2297 I |X| \u2297 \u03b3 , and to D \u03c6 as local if D \u03c6 = \u03c4,x D \u03c6;\u03c4,x where each term D \u03c6;\u03c4,x is supported on a disk of radius r around (\u03c4, x), and depends on the values of \u03c6 at points within this disk. The action D \u03c6 is 'term-wise solvable' if each D \u03c6;\u03c4,x satisfies (F9). Any local D \u03c6 obeying (F9) with \u0393 = I \u03b2 \u2297 I |X| \u2297 \u03b3 can be made term-wise solvable by replacing D \u03c6;\u03c4,x \u2192 1 2 (D \u03c6;\u03c4,x \u2212 \u0393D \u03c6;\u03c4,x \u0393) and then D \u03c6;\u03c4,x \u2192 24 1 2 D \u03c6;\u03c4,x \u2212 D \u2020 \u03c6;\u03c4,x . The twisted fermionic boundary conditions in (22) are implemented by declaring that the index '(\u03c4 = 0, x, \u03b1)' that appears in Eq.(F8) corresponds to (\u03c4 = \u03b2, x + \u03bb\u0398 (y) , y, \u03b1) with \u03bb = 0. Equation (F9) then holds for all \u03bb if \u0393 = I \u03b2 \u2297 I |X| \u2297 \u03b3. Under these conditions, solvable fermionic actions can then be incorporated into the definition of locally sign-free DQMC given in Sec.V.All examples given in Ref. [21] have an on-site \u0393 and local D \u03c6 , and it follows from the above discussion that, under these conditions, solvable fermionic actions can then be incorporated into the definition of locally sign-free DQMC given in Sec.V.A bosonic action S \u03c6 for a complex valued field \u03c6 = |\u03c6| e i\u03b8 was termed 'solvable' in Ref. [21] if S \u03c6 = S |\u03c6| \u2212 u,u \u03b2 u,u |\u03c6 u | |\u03c6 u | cos (\u03b5 u \u03b8 u + \u03b5 u \u03b8 u ) , (F10) where u = (x, \u03c4 ), u = (x , \u03c4 ), and \u03b5 u , \u03b5 u \u2208 {\u00b11}, and \u03b2 u,u \u2265 0. For such actions, it was shown that all correlators D\u03c6e \u2212S \u03c6 \u03c6 u1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03c6 u k are non-negative, and therefore \u03c6 can be added to the diagonal in (F7) with a positive coupling constant g > 0, D \u03c6 = g\u03c6 M \u2212M \u2020 g\u03c6 , without introducing signs, though D \u03c6 is no longer solvable. Solvable bosonic actions are easily incorporated into the framework of Sec.V, as long as they are local in the sense of Eq. (19) , and in particular, \u03b2 u,u = 0 unless the points u and u are close.",
