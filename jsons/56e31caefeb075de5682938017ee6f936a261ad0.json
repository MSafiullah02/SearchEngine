Relaxing social distancing mandates demonstrates how differently states approach the COVID-19 pandemic, with some states lifting nearly oversight, states are free to enact public health measures they feel are safe, creating confusion and distrust among American citizens. The US government is the single largest funding source for global health worldwide, with precedent for widespread infectious disease programming beginning with U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in 2003. However, the budget for global health stagnated over the past ten years despite public health crises like the outbreaks of the Ebola virus from 2014-2016 and Zika virus from 2016 to present. 16 After this decade of declining funding, 2019 brought improvements in national public health emergency preparedness.In June 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump signed the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act, expanding funding for a wide span of public health emergencies. In the same year the federal government increased public health preparedness funding by an average of 5% to each state.17 However, significant budget cuts to the CDC followed these modest increases in state funding for emergency preparedness. The national budget for fiscal year 2021 removes an estimated $700 million in CDC funding, representing 9% of its total budget. These budget cuts will directly affected The National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (responsible for fighting new outbreaks such as the COVID-19). If adopted, this decreased funding will further strain health departments, both of which collaborate closely with healthcare systems in response to novel and re-emerging infectious diseases threats. a growing shortage of infectious diseases (ID) physicians, and even fewer ID trained hospital epidemiologists, in the US. The number of medical school graduates seeking a career in ID consistently decreased over the last decade with nearly 40% of ID training fellowships going unfilled. A combination of rising medical education tuitions and a growing reliance on loans increased mean medical education debt to $190,000 (US dollars). Reimbursement for ID specialty services is the lowest across the medical subspecialties. These economic factors result in an ID specialist recruitment disincentive, with medical graduates seeking higher paying specialties.",

In the recent past, vaccine development in the setting of emerging infectious disease outbreaks (for viruses such as Ebola and Zika) has not been fast enough to alter the course of those outbreaks significantly. Reducing vaccine development timelines necessitates changes in vaccine development funding and requires global collaboration.23 New funding sources must be a priority in the race to discover a safe COVID-19 vaccine.Successful Models of COVID 19 Pandemic Response: Germany and South KoreaAmerican exceptionalism, \"an unwavering belief in the uniqueness of the United States\"22 may have contributed to the US COVID-19 response. Under this framework, an underlying mistrust of government promotes individualism and special interests, which supersedes the common good. Despite the United States spending more per capita on health care, we consistently rank at or near the bottom of health outcomes when compared to other developed countries. 25 This is inconsistent with the common good. American exceptionalism, particularly as applied to healthcare, may have contributed to a poorly conceived, underfunded and ill-coordinated national response to COVID-19.",
