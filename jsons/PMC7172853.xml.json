This is particularly true in China, where a highly pathogenic PRRS virus (PRRSV) variant strain has been causing devastating epidemic, so-called \u201cporcine high fever disease (PHFD)\u201d, for the past two to three years (An et al., 2007, Tian et al., 2007, Tong et al., 2007). Traditional vaccines displayed limited cross-protection efficacy, and better PRRS vaccine is in dire need to control PHFD.",

            "text": "PRRSV is further classified into two distinct genotypes, (European) Type I (Wensvoort et al., 1991) and (North American type) II (Benfield et al., 1992). As a member of the Arteriviridae of the order Nidovirales (Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998), PRRSV is similar to lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus (LDV), equine arteritis virus (EAV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) in terms of genomic structure, the mechanisms employed for replication and transcription. PRRSV genome is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of approximately 15 kb in length (Meulenberg et al., 1993), with a 5\u2032 cap and 3\u2032 poly(A) tail. The genomic coding region was flanked by terminal untranslated regions (UTR), 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-UTR, which play key regulatory roles in the viral life cycle (Shanmukhappa et al., 2000, Sun et al., 2007, Verheije et al., 2001, Verheije et al., 2002a). The genome includes at least 9 open reading frames (ORFs), designated ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF2a, ORF2b, and ORF3\u20137. ORF2\u20137 encode at least 7 structural proteins including glycoprotein 2 (GP2), GP3, GP4, GP5, Membrane (M) protein, Nucleocapsid (N) protein, and the recently recognized ORF2b-encoded 73 amino acid nonglycosylated (E) protein (Mardassi et al., 1996, Meulenberg et al., 1993, Meulenberg, 2000, Mounir et al., 1995, Nelsen et al., 1999, Saito et al., 1996, Thiel et al., 1993, Wootton et al., 2000, Wu et al., 2005). The functions of the structural proteins play in the virus replication process warrant further study. For instance, there is no experimental evidence supporting the assumption that GP5 is the viral attachment protein, while it is under debate if GP3 is a structural constituent of the PRRSV virion (Mardassi et al., 1996, Meulenberg et al., 1993, Meulenberg, 2000).",

            "text": "Arteriviral structural proteins are expressed through a set of co-terminal subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNA), which are believed to be generated via a Nidovirus-specific, not yet fully-understood discontinuous transcription. Several lines of evidence support two models: a leader-primed transcription model, with another involving the discontinuous extension of minus-strand RNA. Based on these models, the transcription-regulating sequence (TRS, UUAACC for PRRSV) of the Leader (5\u2032 UTR in PRRSV) and the downstream Body TRS (TRS-B), preceding the ORF coding region of the structural protein in the viral genome play key roles in discontinuous transcription (Pasternak et al., 2006). Base-pairing between the Leader TRS (TRS-L) and the complementary sequences in the minus-strand of the TRS-B mediates discontinuous jumping during synthesis of the minus-strand templates for EAV sgmRNAs (van Marle et al., 1999). TRS-flanking sequence could also affect nidoviral transcription (Curtis et al., 2004, Nelsen et al., 1999, Pasternak et al., 2004, Pasternak et al., 2006, Sola et al., 2005, Yount et al., 2006). In addition, Pasternak et al. (2004) engineered several copies of a body TRS-flanking sequence cassette inserted into an EAV full-length clone-derived replicon, and observed that sgmRNA abundance progressively favor smaller RNA species, implying that downstream TRS-B could exert negative effect on the upstream one.",

These infectious clones have also provided powerful tools for the development of genetically engineered vaccines that can be differentiable with PRRSV field isolates, a desirable trait of vaccine for ultimate eradication of PRRS. Furthermore, such reverse genetic system (RGS) provides an excellent platform for functional dissection of arteriviral structural proteins. However, it is known that variable length of overlapping coding sequence shared by the adjacent ORFs of the structural proteins. For example, an overlapping region of 255 nt exists between ORF3/4 of Type I PRRSV, while 15 and 10 nt span the coding regions between ORF5/6 and ORF6/7, respectively (Meng et al., 1995, Meulenberg and Petersen-den Besten, 1996, Morozov et al., 1995, Nelsen et al., 1999). The biological significance of these overlapping regions on PRRSV replication is unknown. On the other hand, such overlapping nature poses problem for genetic manipulations of an individual structural protein ORF without affecting the adjacent one. Aiming to define the cell tropism determinant, Verheije et al. (2002b) constructed chimeric arteriviruses using Type I PRRSV infectious clone as backbone expressing the terminal domains of EAV GP5 and M protein, and found that these assumed viral attachment protein GP5 or M failed to change cell tropism as expected. In addition, these authors found that separation of the overlapping regions was critical for viral viability for such chimeric viruses, implying that arterivirus gene expression is tightly regulated. de Vries et al. (2000) demonstrated that while the precise arrangement of the overlapping regions for EAV structural proteins was also necessary for viral infection, it was possible to rescue virus from transfected cells when overlapping regions between ORF4/5, ORF5/6, and ORF4/5/6 in EAV infectious clones were separated by inserting polylinkers. Although numerous PRRSV infectious clones have been successfully constructed (Calvert et al., 2002, Calvert et al., 2003, Fang et al., 2006a, Meulenberg et al., 1998, Nielsen et al., 2003, Truong et al., 2004, Yuan and Wei, 2008), the issue of overlapping coding regions of the structural proteins still impedes functional studies.",

We also directly inserted Pac I, Swa I, and Asc I sites between ORF1/2, and inserted a unique restriction enzyme site (Nde I) between ORF4/5, and ORF7/3\u2032 UTR. A series of mutation viruses were recovered after transfection of cells using in vitro RNA transcripts of the constructed full-length mutant DNA clones. Our findings demonstrated that 1) the overlapping nature of the coding regions for structural proteins is dispensable for the PRRSV viability; 2) the insertion of foreign nucleotide sequence is feasible for physical separation of the ORFs coding for structural proteins, and such separation did not interrupt the subgenomic RNA synthesis; 3) the plaque morphology, growth kinetics, and antigenicity of these mutant viruses were virtually indistinguishable from those of the parental virus in cultured cells; and 4) these mutant viruses remained genetic stable for at least five passages in vitro culture system.

Virus plaque morphology remained essentially the same with that of the parental virus, vAPRRS.

Indeed, the flanking sequences of TRS influence sgmRNA transcription (Curtis et al., 2004, Nelsen et al., 1999, Pasternak et al., 2004, Pasternak et al., 2006, Sola et al., 2005, Yount et al., 2006). de Vries et al. (2000) discovered an novel atypical sgmRNA5.2 from a recombinant EAV containing foreign sequence between ORF5 and ORF6, indicating the landscape for certain sgmRNA synthesis can be changed by insertional mutation and thus activate cryptic or new TRS. The recombinant PRRSVs described in this study did not produce detectable novel subgenomic RNA, but insertion between ORF5/6 might cause the down- or up-regulation of the upstream sgmRNA2/3 and 4, respectively. Curiously, the same insertion sequence inserted between ORF6/7 barely affected virus replication. It implies that the 39 nt insertion of into ORF5/6 locus induces changes of local secondary structure and spatial relationship with some yet-unknown upstream transcription-regulating elements. Using the energy minimization program of Mfold Web server (http://frontend.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold/cgi-bin/rna-form1\u20132.3.cgi) (Zuker, 2003) and the secondary structure drawings of RNA molecules by RnaViz version 2 (De Rijk et al., 2003), we conducted local secondary structure prediction to all mutation sites including all TRS and flanking sequence. Compared with the native structure (Fig. 4B), ORF5/6 insertion induces a major branched stem-loop structure (Fig. 4C), among other minor changes. All other mutations did not induce major changes in terms of the overall structure, number and position of stem-loops, as well as the TRS position, which is always located on loop area (data not shown).",

Because of a series of sgmRNAs are employed, nidovirus is attractive vector in that multiple GOIs can be express theoretically. Unlike coronaviruses containing numerous accessory genes for virus replication, arterivirus has a rigid icosahedral nucleocapsid and overlapping coding regions, it proves to be difficult to find an optimal locus for GOI expression. Numerous studies have been directed utilizing the nonstructural protein 2 (nsp2) coding region, the most variable part of PRRSV genome, as a GOI insertion site (Fang et al., 2006b, Han et al., 2007, Kim et al., 2007). In most cases, the inserted genes were modified and/or chewed out during further serial passage, maybe due to the fact that nsp2 and its fusion form have to be under proteolytic processing during nsp maturation. In our study, we developed a platform that can be potentially used to express GOI between ORFs coding for structural proteins. In addition, these mutant cDNA clones would be of great value for making chimeric PRRSV as vaccine candidate. Using an attenuated PRRSV derived infectious cDNA as the backbone, one can readily swap in the immuno-protective protein(s) easily. Such chimeric virus vaccine would be genetically tagged, and powerful to combat the ever-changing PRRSV (Wang et al., 2008).",

Briefly, oligonucleotide primers were designed such that the foreign insertion sequence were incorporated at the 5\u2032 end or in the middle of the primer, leaving at least 10 nucleotides at the 3\u2032 end matching with the template sequence. Using circular plasmid DNA as the template, PCR were run as descried in the instruction manual of the QuickChange mutagenesis kit. The plasmid template was eliminated by Dpn I digestion (New England Biolabs, Ipswitch, MA), followed by transformation of Top 10 competent cells (Invitrogen) with the digested PCR mixture. The intermediate plasmid was screened and verified by restriction enzyme mapping and nucleotide sequencing, and the target region were swapped into the pAPRRS backbone treated with the same restriction enzymes, resulting in the final full-length mutant clone. The purified full-length mutant plasmid was all verified by PCR, restriction enzyme digestion and nucleotide sequencing.",
