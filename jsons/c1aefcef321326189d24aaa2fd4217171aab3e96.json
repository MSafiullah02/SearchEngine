Data regarding the etiology of acute respiratory infection (ARI) is scarce in developing countries. The aim of this study was to identify the viral etiology of ARI/ALRI in hospitalized children and factors associated with increased length of stay (LoS) and severe disease presentation in Northern Jordan. This was a prospective viral surveillance study using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in children younger than 5 years admitted with ARI to two main hospitals in Northern Jordan during the winter of 2016. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained and tested for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and other viruses. Demographic and clinical characteristics of RSV-positive patients were compared with those of RSV-negative patients. There were 479 patients hospitalized with ARI. Their mean age (standard deviation) was 10.4 (11.6) months. 53.9% tested positive for at least one virus, with RSV being the most commonly detected virus (34%). Compared with RSV-negative patients, RSV-positive patients were younger, more likely to have chronic lung disease, and more likely to present with cough, rhinorrhea, difficulty in breathing, retraction, flaring, grunting, wheezing, and a higher respiratory rate. Prematurity, presence of a chronic illness, oxygen saturation < 90%, and atelectasis and consolidation on chest X-rays were significantly associated with an increased mean LoS. Patients with a history of prematurity had higher risk of severe disease (odds ratio \u00bc 2.6; 95% confidence interval: 1.5, 4.7; p \u00bc 0.001). Compared with patients 6 months old and younger, patients aged 6.1 to 12 months were less likely to have severe disease. Human metapneumovirus (HMPV)-positive ALRI was associated with increased odds of severe disease. Viruses are recognized as etiological agent of ARI/ALRI-associated morbidity in developing countries that need more attention and implementation of targeted strategies for prevention and detection. HMPV can be a cause of severe ALRI.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide in children younger than 5 years. 1 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral pathogen causing acute respiratory infection (ARI) in young children globally and is an important cause of ARIrelated hospitalization and death, especially in developing countries. 2, 3 It was estimated globally in 2015, that 33.1 million cases of RSV-ALRI resulted in approximately 3.2 million hospital admissions and 59,600 in-hospital deaths in children younger than 5 years. 4 There are other viruses associated with ALRI in children younger than 5 years including human metapneumovirus (HMPV), rhinovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, and influenza virus. 5, 6 All these viruses, except for influenza virus, are more likely to occur in children younger than 5years in the Eastern Mediterranean region than in older children and adults. 7 Data about the incidence and frequency of common viruses causing ARI/ALRI in young children and the risk factors for the severe presentation of ARI/ALRI in developing countries, particularly in the Middle East, are scarce. [8] [9] [10] Therefore, there are limitations affecting the estimation of the burden of ARI/ALRI due to viruses on health resources and the implementation of strategies for prevention such as RSV prophylaxis 11 and a future RSV vaccine. 12 Methods of detecting RSV and other viruses causing ARI/ALRI include antigen detection, cell culture, serology testing, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), with the latter having the highest detection sensitivity among other testing modalities. 13 The use of RT-PCR to detect the viral pathogens causing ARI in young children has been limited in Jordan due to its high cost. Few studies have been conducted in Jordan to detect the etiology of ARI using RT-PCR for diagnostic testing. Most of the available studies tested children for only one virus. [14] [15] [16] [17] Halasa et al studied the viral etiology of ARI/ALRI in hospitalized children younger than 2 years in Amman, the capital city of Jordan, and RSV was the most commonly detected virus. 18 The peak months of RSV infection were reported to be mainly January and February. 18 However, RSV prophylaxis is not the standard of care for high-risk groups of children who are vulnerable for RSV infection in Jordan; it is not available in government or public hospitals nor it is covered by insurance. Therefore, further studies in Jordan are warranted to highlight the burden of viral ARI/ALRI caused by RSV to convince policy makers of the necessity of prevention. In addition, identifying the etiology and the frequency of other viruses causing ARI/ALRI can guide practitioners in optimizing the management of patients with ARI/ALRI, such as avoiding the overuse of antibiotics, especially given that viral testing is not a routine practice in diagnosing children admitted to the hospitals with ARI/ALRI in Jordan. Identifying the risk factors for hospital admission and severe disease in young children with ARI/ALRI is vital to accurately estimating the morbidity and mortality associated with ARI/ALRI and thus the burden imposed on individuals and health system in Jordan.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 129, "end": 130, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 371, "end": 373, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 374, "end": 375, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 569, "end": 570, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 779, "end": 781, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 782, "end": 783, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 959, "end": 960, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1184, "end": 1187, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1188, "end": 1191, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1192, "end": 1196, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1392, "end": 1394, "text": "11", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1421, "end": 1423, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1694, "end": 1696, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1999, "end": 2003, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2004, "end": 2008, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2009, "end": 2013, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2014, "end": 2018, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2201, "end": 2203, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2286, "end": 2288, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The objectives of this study were to identify the viruses causing ARI/ALRI using real-time RT-PCR in children younger than 5 years who were hospitalized during winter season of 2016 in two main hospitals in Irbid, Northern Jordan, which is in a different geographic area and has different population characteristics from Amman and to determine demographic and clinical characteristics of patients admitted with ARI/ALRI and the risk factors for increased length of hospital stay (LoS) and severe disease.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "This was a prospective viral surveillance study of children younger than 5 years diagnosed with ARI who were admitted to Princess Rahmah Hospital (PRH, the main community children's hospital in Northern Jordan that is run by the Ministry of Health) and King Abdullah University Hospital (KAUH, the only university-based hospital and tertiary referral health center in Irbid, Northern Jordan).
