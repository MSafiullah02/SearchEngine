Both physicians and IBD patients have been concerned that the immunosuppressant medications that we use to great effect in IBD patients could put them at risk for both more frequent infections by SARS-CoV19, and more severe manifestations of the COVID-19 disease.",

IBD patients were under-represented in those diagnosed with symptomatic COVID-19 disease in both locations. It is possible that IBD patients with COVID-19 are being under-tested and under-reported compared with people without IBD. However, the fact that patients on immunosuppressants are generally more likely to seek health care and get tested for symptoms, and more likely to be regarded with concern by health care professionals, compared with people without IBD makes this possibility unlikely.",
