(1) On March 17 th 2020, in a level III hospital in Porto, a Caucasian 31-yearold woman with 38 weeks' gestation was admitted at the obstetrical emergency department. She was a healthy gravida 2 para 1, with no complications during pregnancy. At admission, she was complaining of mild painful uterine contractions for a few hours. She was in home isolation as her husband was J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f",

Because she was a close contact of a confirmed COVID-19 case, she was attended as a suspected case and settled in an isolation room. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis on nasal and oropharyngeal swabs. After obstetric evaluation, latent phase of labor was diagnosed, the cervix was 3 cm dilated and 30% effaced. Care in labor continued in the same isolation room. All health care workers in contact with the pregnant woman wore appropriate personal protective equipment for contact and airborne precautions with eye protection. Epidural analgesia was performed as earlier as possible and labor augmentation with oxytocin was started. The fetus was monitored with external continuous cardiotocography and cervical dilation was assessed every two hours. Ten hours after admission, cervix was full dilated and cardiotocography became suspicious (figure 1) requiring acute tocolysis with salbutamol. Subsequently, cardiotocography exhibited a normal fetal pattern and an operative vaginal delivery was performed with fetal vacuum extraction, in order to shorten the second stage of labor. Umbilical cord was immediately clamped without neonate-maternal contact. The female newborn weighed 3240 grams and Apgar score was 9 at 1 st and 10 at 5 th minutes. The child was separated from the mother immediately after birth and placed in a single-patient negative pressure room. Newborn nasal and oropharyngeal swabs RT-PCR test for SARS-Cov-2 were performed. Two hours after birth newborn tested negative and the repeated test (at 48h of life) was also negative. Mother was discharged at 3 rd day postpartum, symptomless, waiting for recovery criteria at home. The newborn remained at nursery unit until family provide conditions for receiving her at home.",
