Recently, American guidelines [2] abandoned healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) because of the lack of evidence showing differences in microbiology of CAP and HCAP. This definition change could introduce differences in epidemiological reporting. Important advances in CAP have also been reported since pneumococcal vaccines and diagnostic tests for viruses. Recently, Nature Medicine published the first use of phages to treat a multidrug-resistant (MDR) microorganism [3] and Lancet Infectious Diseases reported the first use of pneumolysin in severe CAP treatment added to standard of care in a phase II trial [4]. These advances emphasise the importance of continuously updating CAP management and research and development.",

CAP notification is optional even in developed countries, except when presenting as invasive pneumococcal disease (when CAP is accompanied by the identification of pneumococcus in sterile fluids such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and pleural, joint or peritoneal fluid) and Legionnaires disease in some countries. Worldwide differences in access to healthcare services also preclude direct comparison of incidence [20]. Furthermore, scarce data are available from primary care or representing patients treated in ambulatory settings. Moreover, CAP incidence varies considerably according to geographic location, study methods, case definition and study population [21, 22]. CAP incidence varies and is also highly influenced by age and co-morbidities (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease and liver disease). A seasonal effect that doubles the rate of pneumonia in the winter months impacts, additionally, incidence studies [23].",

One-ninth of patients hospitalized with CAP will need intensive care unit (ICU) admission because of severe respiratory failure, severe sepsis, or septic shock [32, 33] and CAP mortality in these patients remains very high, reaching near 50% [32]. A progressively higher incidence of severe CAP was reported in ICU, but the mortality rate had decreased by 18% over a 15-year period [34]. Data reporting on severity could be driven by reimbursement and, therefore, not represent a real increase in severity CAP. Patients who had been treated in the hospital for CAP have a clinically significant long-term poor survival when compared to matched controls. This increased post-discharge mortality is driven by pulmonary complications, new CAP episodes and cardiovascular events, probably in the course of a persistent inflammatory response [32, 35].",

Important variations are found according to patient severity and used diagnostic tools. The emergence of new diagnostic tests improved the recognition of pathogens compared with previous tests [40], not only for viruses but also for bacterial pathogens, allowing earlier directed therapy and antibiotic de-escalation. A higher rate of microorganism isolation was reported when newer diagnostic approaches and molecular techniques were used [39\u201341]. Some of these approaches are not widely available in clinical practice and their use remains controversial because no studies prove their outcome benefits and tests are costly. Moreover, antiviral agents are inactive against some viruses which precludes the utility of viral identification in clinical practice.",

It is an important limitation for the widespread use of new antibiotics, in spite of drug usage specificities in critically ill patients. Studies are needed in more severely ill patients. RCTs showing superiority instead of \u201cnon-inferiority\u201d are needed to show a clear advantage of new drugs.

Although it is likely to enhance patient performance, the published positive results focused on soft outcomes (reduction of treatment failure, length of stay, progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome, radiological progression and time to clinical stability) [69\u201373]. Steroid treatment depending on high inflammatory response should also be retested addressing hard endpoints [74] because the previous published RCT used radiological improvement as a primary outcome. The only study that established mortality as the primary outcome [75] has not yet been published. Precise identification of patients that will benefit from steroids is critical, given that these drugs have important side effects. Steroids have the potential to reduce survival in viral respiratory infections. The ideal method to convincingly exclude viral infection before steroid therapy initiation should also be addressed. For that, new studies are needed in specific populations (i.e. studying separately severe and non-severe CAP) to improve the body of evidence about steroid usage in CAP.",

The clinical meaning of these findings remains controversial because, for now, there is no randomized clinical trial confirming the superiority of therapies containing macrolides regarding mortality [81, 82]. However, observational studies [83\u201386] showed consistently improved outcomes in invasive pneumococcal disease in severely ill patients (i.e. invasively ventilated and under vasopressor treatment). Some guidelines [87\u201390] recommend use of macrolides in combination therapy with beta-lactams as first-line therapy in CAP, either in ICU and non-ICU patients. Those recommendations were mainly driven by observational studies that are subject to bias. Evidence from recent RCTs [91], failed again to show the advantages of this approach in non-critically ill patients that had never been clearly shown. The generalized use of macrolides has the potential to promote antibiotic resistance, so until an RCT shows evidence of benefit macrolides should be judiciously used in non-critically ill patients, whereas macrolides are associated with QTc interval prolongation, gastrointestinal events and drug interactions.",

Data regarding herd protection is not consensual, but its disparity could be explained by the different time intervals between generalized vaccination and studies [93, 94]. Further, vaccine introduction also leads to serotype shifting; meanwhile, no effects in resistance patterns were noted [95]. Several efforts were made to develop a vaccine to prevent pneumococcal infection resulting in two available vaccines: pneumococcal polysaccharide 23-valent (PPV23, contains capsular polysaccharides of 60% of serotypes causing disease in adults) and pneumococcal conjugate 13-valent (PCV13, stimulates antibody production against 28\u201342% of serotypes causing disease, varying according different geographical areas). For both, vaccine efficacy has been proven for invasive pneumococcal disease [96, 97]. Only PCV13 has been clearly associated with the prevention of non-invasive and invasive pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia (CAPiTA trial [97]) regarding vaccine-targeted serotypes. In different countries, vaccine indications vary, some based on believing that PCV13 could boost immunity created by PPV23 (when previously administered) [98]. It is controversial whether PCV13 is superior to PPV23, because comparative trials are lacking. New outcomes should also be determined for invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal CAP, as well as all-cause mortality and pneumococcal CAP-related mortality. The definition of immunosuppressed patients also varies according to different studies, which impairs the process of studying real immunosuppressive risk factors for pneumococcal infection.",
