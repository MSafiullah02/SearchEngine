            "text": "Background: Viral respiratory illness is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The human bocavirus (HBoV) is a recently recognized parvovirus isolated from human respiratory secretions. Objectives: To define the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics in adult and pediatric patients with evidence of HBoV. Study design: From October 2005 through October 2006, we screened respiratory samples from children and adults negative for common respiratory pathogens for HBoV by PCR. Demographic and clinical characteristics were obtained from medical records of HBoV positive individuals. Results: Of 2075 samples screened, 1826 (88.0%) represented distinct respiratory events: 1539 (84.3%) were pediatric (<18 years), and 273 (15.0%) adult (\u226518 years). Forty (2.2%) patients had HBoV: 36 (2.3%) children and 4 (1.5%) adults. HBoV positive children had history of prematurity (31.3%) and cardiac disease (18.8%). Adults had underlying pulmonary (100%) and cardiac (50%) disease. Twenty-seven children (84.4%) were hospitalized; 9 (28.1%) required intensive care. All adults were hospitalized; none required intensive care. Nosocomial acquisition likely occurred in 3 patients. Conclusions: HBoV circulates in Cleveland, OH, in children and adults with similar frequencies, and can warrant hospitalization and intensive care. Further study would clarify our understanding of this newly recognized human pathogen.",

            "text": "Respiratory illness is an important reason for adult and pediatric emergency department visits. 1 In the United States, the proportion of pediatric hospitalizations caused by asthma, pneumonia, and acute bronchitis is nearly 22%. Of all hospital discharges, 9.7% are attributed to diseases of the respiratory system. 2 In the United States, the annual burden to society for respiratory infections is estimated to be $112 billion. 3 Allander et al. (2005) described a novel parvovirus isolated from human respiratory secretions from patients with pneumonia named the human bocavirus (HBoV). 4 Since that time, its presence in both the pediatric and adult population has been confirmed throughout the world. The incidence of this pathogen has ranged from 1.8% to 19%, with a variety of clinical presentations. [5] [6] [7] Human bocavirus has been found in patients with upper and lower respiratory tract disease, 5, 8, 9 as well as gastrointestinal illness. [10] [11] [12] Cases reported in children constitute the majority; adult cases are reported less frequently. 7, 13, 14 Common presentations include cough, wheezing, fever, and emesis. 7, 14, 15 Thai adults have been reported to have pneumonia associated with HBoV severe enough to warrant hospitalization. 13 Multiple studies have reported frequent detection of other viral pathogens in HBoV positive samples. 16 It has been hypothesized that prolonged shedding or persistence may be a reason. Because of this, questions remain about the role of HBoV in respiratory infection.",
