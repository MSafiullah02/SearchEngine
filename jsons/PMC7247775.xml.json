The ideal distance to be maintained from a person infected with COVID-19 was rightly answered by only (43.5%) of the respondents. When it came to steps involved in handwashing, it was observed that only 56.4% respondents were fully aware about this technique.

Because of the serious situation of the pandemic and the overwhelming news reports on this public health emergency, this population would actively learn knowledge of this infectious disease from various TV and news channels and the official website of the National Health Commission of India. The levels of education and COVID-19 knowledge scores supports this speculation. However when it came to questions pertaining to practices during medical imaging procedures of suspected COVID-19 patients, most of the MIPs have insufficient knowledge about dealing with COVID-19 suspected patients and managing the radiology imaging room.",

Blood test is the first and most reliable method of diagnosis for suspected COVID-19 patients. However, x-ray investigation can only be used as a supplementary measure for confirming COVID-19. Majority of the respondents 48.5% wrongly answered that x-ray can be regarded as the reliable method of diagnosis for suspected COVID-19 patients. The preferred imaging modality of choice to screen a suspected COVID-19 patient is portable x-ray because it is easy to follow infection control measures and the radiology imaging room will also not be contaminated. It is also easy to disinfect and clean the portable x-ray unit and the isolated room where the imaging procedure was done. However, most of the respondents 50.7% considered computed tomography (CT) scan as the preferred modality in order to screen a suspected patient for COVID-19. CT may provide the following vital findings in COVID-19 positive cases: ground glass opacities in the lungs, air space consolidation, crazy paving appearance and broncho-vascular thickening in the lesion (7\u201310). Hence, we presume that the respondents might have gone through these studies and hence they considered CT to be the preferred modality of choice for suspected COVID-19 patients. The participants of the current study showed fair knowledge about general precautions about COVID-19 but showed poor knowledge about practices to be followed while dealing with COVID-19 suspected patients. Majority of the respondents 71.6% were unaware about air-exchange rate in rooms, after scanning a suspected COVID-19 patient and avoiding the radiographic suite for one hour.
