The spatially interdependent networks are extremely\nvulnerable. Any fraction of interdependent nodes will lead to first-order transition.23 From an identical dependency map to totally\nrandom dependency map, the randomness of the dependency map may be one of the most important\nfactors leading to the emergence of discontinuous percolation.

We use\napproximate entropy(ApEn) as the measure of randomness. One of the big\nchallenges here is how to introduce controlled degree of randomness into the system.\nTherefore, we propose an intermediate model which describes the system with dependency map\nbetween identical map and totally random map. Inspired by the constructing procedure of the\nWatt-Strogatz small-world model,25\nstarting from an identical dependency map, we rewire each dependency link at random with\nprobability q. By increasing q from 0 to 1, the\nApEn increases monotonically. Therefore, the traverse of randomness can\nbe generally represented by q. We reveal that there is a critical value\nqc, below which the percolation transition becomes\ncontinuous, whereas for any q > qc, the\ncollapse is discontinuous. Changing the topologies on a single layer, we discover that\nqc is different for interdependent scale-free networks,\nWatts-Strogatz networks, and Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi networks. There is another critical value q\u2032c\nfor the function pc VS q, which is different\nfrom qc. The percolation threshold\npc increases with q when q<qc\u2032\nand remains approximately constant when q>qc\u2032.\nAdditionally, we present an analytical method for time scale of cascade failures based on\ncritical p and find that the four topologies display rich transient properties when\nq changes from 0 to 1. Finally, we analyze the influence of limited\ndependency length on spatial networks. With the same dependency length, we show that a\nlinearly dependent system is always continuous, but not continuous for some locally randomly\ndependent system. Our results show that the randomness of dependency may be one of important\nfactors for extreme vulnerability of spatially interdependent systems.",

In Reference 27, the authors\ndiscovered that the dependency length plays a critical role in the percolation transition.\nHowever, we find that under linear dependency map, the change of dependency length\ninfluences the percolation property little. From the discrepancy of those two situations, it\ncan be inferred that local property of dependency relationship makes a notable difference.\nAnd, the local property of dependency will directly influence the local topological\ninter-similarity between networks. Randomness happens to reflect the local property of\ndependency (we can see this from the computation steps of approximate entropy in Section\nMethods). In spatially interdependent embedded networks, the local characteristics of\ndependency can be more intuitively characterized as the relative length of dependency links.\nUnder linear dependency map, the relative length of dependency links and the approximate\nentropy of dependency map are nearly 0.

Then, on each network, clusters which are detached from the largest\nconnected component are removed. After that, the nodes in each network which lost their\nsupporting nodes in the opposite network are removed. This, in turn, causes more clusters\nto break off from the giant component, and this process is continued until no more\nclusters break off. First, we analyze the situation with totally random dependency maps.\nAfter the initial attack, only a fraction\np1 = p\u221e(p) of\nnodes remains functional. Each node in A that is removed causes the removal of its\ninterdependent node in B. Then only\np\u221e(p1) nodes in B remain alive.\nThis produces further damage in A and causes cascading failures. The cascade failures can\nbe represented by the recursive equation for the survived fraction\npi14,27\np0=p,p1=pP0p\u221e(p0)=P\u221e(p),\u22efpi=pPi\u22121p\u221e(pi\u22121).(1)In the limit i \u2192 \u221e,\nEq.

Next, we consider the mutual\npercolation for more casual situations where the dependency is not totally random. For\nevery dependency link, there is a probability q to rewire it at random.\nThis is equivalent to the situation with a fraction 1 \u2212 q of nodes\nmapping to itself and the remaining q nodes having a random dependency\nmap. The case of q = 1 corresponds to the scenario of a random dependency\nmap, and q = 0 is identical to the conventional percolation on a single\nlattice. For the initial attack which destroys a fraction 1 \u2212 p of nodes, \u230am=(1\u2212p)N\u230b\nnodes are removed. We compute the probability Psame that one\nnode in A depends on the same node in B.
