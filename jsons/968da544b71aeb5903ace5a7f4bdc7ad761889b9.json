The baculovirus expression system (BVES) is a powerful tool for recombinant protein production (Jarvis, 2009) because it is safe, high expression levels can be achieved, and post-translational modifications can be incorporated.

However, it is not easy to introduce foreign genes by conventional molecular cloning methods due to the large size of AcMNPV genome. Therefore, researchers have modified the AcMNPV genome to allow effective foreign gene insertion by site-specific transposition or homogenous recombination (Hitchman et al., 2012; Luckow et al., 1993) .

The MultiBac system generates multi-GEC donor and acceptor vectors from junior plasmids carrying individual GECs by homing endonuclease-based multiplication module (Berger et al., 2004) .

The nsps are encoded in open-reading frame 1a (ORF1a) and ORF1b and synthesized initially as two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. During or after synthesis, these polyproteins are cleaved by virus-encoded proteases into 16 nsps (Ziebuhr et al., 2000) . These nsps, together with other viral proteins and possible cellular proteins, assemble into a membrane-bound RTC (Sawicki et al., 2007) . This strategy has been recently exploited to express protein complexes using baculovirus system (Nie et al., 2014; Vijayachandran et al., 2011) . By this strategy, individual subunits are separated by protease cleavage sites and expressed as a long polyprotein. In vivo processing of the polyprotein allows the proper assembly of the multiprotein complex. This method is very good for balancing expression levels and achieving the correct subunit stoichiometry (Vijayachandran et al., 2011) . However, when expressing a very large multiprotein complex, the DNA fragment encoding the polyprotein is very long. It is usually not easy to build such a large transfer plasmid in the average laboratory. In addition, with increasing gene length, gene synthesis becomes more expensive and time-consuming.

The human exocyst complex contains eight evolutionary conserved subunits-EXOC1 (102 kDa), EXOC2 (104 kDa), EXOC3 (86 kDa), EXOC4 (110 kDa), EXOC5 (82 kDa), EXOC6 (94 kDa), EXOC7 (78 kDa) and EXOC8 (82 kDa). Because the published literature does not provide information about which subunit is the most suitable for complex purification, we used Scheme 3 (Fig. 3) to screen the target subunits. All of the vectors we built for exocyst expression are shown in Table 1 (see also Supplementary Materials and Methods S3). First, we constructed two types of recombinant baculoviruses, BV-E1547 (EXOC1, 5, 4, 7) and BV-E2863 (EXOC2, 8, 6, 3), to express the eight subunits without any tags according to Scheme 2 (Fig. 2c) .

Insect cells were coinfected with BV-E1S547 and BV-2863. After one-step strep-affinity purification, the entire exocyst complex with high purity was obtained (Fig. 4c) . The tethering activity of this purified exocyst complex was determined via in vitro liposome tethering assay (to be published elsewhere). Negative-staining electron microscopy (nsEM) of the sample showed homogenous rod-like particles (Fig. 4d) . Preliminary 2D classification of nsEM images (Fig. 4e ) and 3D reconstruction (Fig. 4f) indicate that the human exocyst complex exhibits a similar dimension and shape with the extracted exocyst complex from yeast (Heider et al., 2016; Mei et al., 2018) . The detailed information about primer design, molecular cloning, cell transfection, protein expression and purification, and electron microscopy is described in Materials and Methods. We also reconstituted the human dynactin complex using the SmartBac system. Dynactin is a multiprotein complex that works with cytoplasmic dynein to transport cargo along microtubules. It is a large complex of approximately 1.2 MDa composed of 23 subunits corresponding to 11 different types of proteins (Reck-Peterson, 2015) . Dynactin is built around a short actin-like filament composed of Arp1 (43 kDa, 8 copies) and \u03b2-actin (42 kDa, 1 copy). The barbed end and the pointed end of this filament are capped by the CapZ\u03b1-CapZ\u03b2 complex (33 kDa, 31 kDa) and the Arp11-p25-p27-p62 complex (46 kDa, 20 kDa, 21 kDa, and 52 kDa) respectively. The shoulder complex, which is made up of p50 (45 kDa, 4 copies), p24 (21 kDa, 2 copies) and p150/p135 (142 kDa/127 kDa, 2 copies), is positioned toward the barbed end of the Arp1 filament (Urnavicius et al., 2015) . As shown in Table 2 , three types of vectors were used to express the 11 subunits of the dynactin complex, and the N-terminal Twin-Strep tag on p135 was used to purify the whole complex. The shoulder complex proteins, p135, p50 and p24, were expressed by BV-M5, which was generated from the plasmid 5V1TG-M5. The final transfer plasmid AB was obtained through recombination of the acceptor 5V1TR-B and donor 4V2-A. Plasmid AB was then used to produce the recombinant baculovirus BV-AB expressing the other eight dynactin subunits. Insect cells were co-infected with BV-M5 and BV-AB to express the entire dynactin complex. After one- Fig. 3 .

The final transfer plasmids, ABCD (RFP) and EFGH (GFP), are generated using Scheme 2, and each will express four protein subunits without affinity labels. Each of the other eight transfer plasmids will express one subunit with an N-terminal Twin-Strep (TS) tag. Either the 4V1 or 5V1 vector can be used here. (b) Production of ten types of recombinant baculoviruses (RBVs). Transformation of the ten types of plasmids into DH10Bac competent cells generates 10 types of RBVs. (c) Screening baculovirus combinations to find the subunit that results in the best purification. The ten types of RBVs are divided into eight groups, and each group contains BV-ABCD (RFP), BV-EFGH (GFP) and one BV-TSn (where n corresponds to the subunit, A to H). Insect cells are co-infected with eight groups of RBVs and strep-affinity resin is used to pull down proteins bound to the TS-tagged subunit. The tagged subunit that allows the best purification of the whole complex is selected. In this example, subunit H is the best. (d) Production of the multiprotein complex. Based on the screening result in (c), a new final transfer plasmid EFG-TSH (GFP) is constructed, which expresses an N-terminal TS-tagged subunit H. The whole protein complex will be purified from insect cells co-infected with BV-ABCD (RFP) and BV-EFG-TSH (GFP). step strep-affinity purification, the dynactin complex was purified well with rational stoichiometry of its subunits (Fig. 4g) . After glycerol density gradient ultracentrifugation, the further purified dynactin complex exhibited a single visible band on a native gel (Fig. 4h) , suggesting a high homogeneity of the specimen. This recombinant human dynactin complex sample was further investigated by nsEM and subsequent 2D class classification (Fig. 4i) , showing a rod-like particle with a shoulder at one end, which is consistent with the endogenous dynactin complex purified from pig brains (Urnavicius et al., 2015) . Besides the human exocyst and dynactin complexes, we also successfully expressed many other protein complexes using the SmartBac system (Fig. 4j) . These include the human COPI complex (7 subunits, 558 kDa) (Wang et al., 2016) , cytoplasmic Dynein complex (12 subunits, 1380 kDa) (Zhang et al., 2017) , CSN complex (8 subunits, 343 kDa) (Mosadeghi et al., 2016) and SCF complex (5 subunits, 180 kDa) (Zheng et al., 2002) .

The classical MultiBac system uses polycistronic vectors carrying multiple GECs for the expression of multiprotein complexes (Berger et al., 2004) . This expression strategy requires first constructing the junior plasmids, each containing only one GEC. Then several rounds of plasmid construction are needed to obtain multi-GEC donor and acceptor vectors. The final transfer plasmid carrying all GECs is produced by Cre-LoxP recombination. MultiBac has been proven powerful in generating multiprotein complexes (Berger et al., 2013; Vijayachandran et al., 2011) , especially when robotic support is available. But in ordinary laboratories without robotics, the first two procedures require a lot of labor and time.

This system uses computationally optimized DNA linker for efficient Gibson assembly reactions to assemble multiple GECs. Although the junior plasmids pLIBs, each containing only one GEC, still need to be constructed first, the final transfer plasmid containing multiple GECs can be assembled by two rounds of Gibson assembly reactions. In the first round, the pBIG1 vectors each containing up to 5 GECs are produced. Then the pBIG2 vectors containing more GECs can be assembled from pBIG1 vectors during the second round. The biGBac system does not depend on combining \"donor\" and \"acceptor\" vectors; as a result any biGBac construct can be used for the generation of baculoviruses. This system has been successfully applied to express the human anaphase promoting complex APC/C that contains 17 different subunits with a total molecular weight of 1.2 MDa (Weissmann et al., 2016) . However, the efficiency of Gibson assembly would decrease when the number and length of assembled DNA fragments increase. Even using the computationally optimized DNA linker, the averaged efficiency of producing pBIG1 constructs from the pLIBs was less than 22% (42/196) (Weissmann et al., 2016) . In addition, because all cDNAs are cloned into pLIB vectors, all GECs contain the same promoter and terminator.

In SmartBac system, long DNA sequences encoding polyproteins are produced by overlapping PCR and Gibson assembly. There is no need to construct junior vectors in comparison with MultiBac and biGBac (Table 3) . To ensure high assembly efficiency, we usually use three DNA fragments for Gibson reactions. The acceptor and donor vectors support blue-white screening, which increases the selection efficiency of positive clones. The final transfer plasmid produced by Cre-LoxP recombination is predesigned to a size of less than 25 kb, which allows an efficient chemical transformation in the subsequent procedure. To increase the stability of the large final transfer plasmid propagated in E. coli, we introduced a low-copy p15A replication origin into the acceptor vectors and cultured the bacteria at 30\u00b0C. The polyprotein strategy is useful in case of that the assembly of the complex is sensitive to subunit stoichiometry. In our experiment, we found the polyprotein strategy would yield a more homogenous expression of human COPI complex (Wang et al., 2016) . In other cases, the subunits may have different copies. For example, in human dynactin complex, the copy number ratio of subunits p135 (or p150):p50:p24 is 2:4:2. To ensure a correct subunit stoichiometry, we designed a polyprotein expressing 1 copy of p135, 2 copies of p50 and 1 copy of p24.
