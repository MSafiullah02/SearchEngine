            "text": "Uveitis is simply inflammation within the uveal tract. More precise terminology to describe the portion of the uveal tract involved includes iritis (inflammation of the iris), iridocyclitis or anterior uveitis (inflammation of the iris and ciliary body), choroiditis or posterior uveitis (inflammation of the choroid), and panuveitis (inflammation of the entire uveal tract) [2]. Differentiating whether inflammation arises from the iris or the ciliary body can be difficult because of their close anatomic proximity and the similar clinical signs [3]. Posterior uveitis can occur independent of anterior uveitis [3]. Endophthalmitis occurs when ocular inflammation is confined to three or more tissues inside the eye [2]. Panophthalmitis indicates that ocular inflammation involves all layers of the eye, including the sclera [2]. Determining the extent of involvement is clinically important, because involvement of the posterior segment may decrease the likelihood of maintaining a visual globe. Therapeutic agents must also be administered systemically to achieve effects within the posterior segment.",

            "text": "Uveitis is a significant cause of ocular disease in dogs and cats [4], [5]. Uveitis occurs after damage to uveal tissue or vasculature disrupts the ocular blood-aqueous barrier (BAB) or the blood-retinal barrier [6]. The BAB is composed of an epithelial barrier at the level of the nonpigmented ciliary epithelium and an endothelial barrier at the level of the iridal blood vessels [7], [8]. The blood-retinal barrier is created by tight junctions within retinal capillaries and the cells of the retinal pigment epithelium [9], [10]. The BAB prevents the movement of molecules across the vascular endothelial surface [6], which results in aqueous humor protein concentrations 200 times less than that of plasma [11]. Disruption of the BAB causes the aqueous humor protein concentration to increase to greater than normal levels, and the resultant light scattering (Tyndall effect) makes the beam from the slit-lamp visible as it traverses the anterior chamber [12]. This phenomenon is known as flare and is a hallmark of uveitis. Disruption of the blood-retinal barrier results in retinal edema, retinal hemorrhage, and detachment of the neurosensory retina [13].",

During episodes of anterior uveitis, the intraocular prostaglandin concentrations may increase 200-fold [14]. Prostaglandins also induce hyperemia and reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP) [3]. PGF2\u03b1 constricts the iris sphincter muscle, causing miosis and pain. In a recently reported study measuring inflammatory mediators in aqueous humor after anterior chamber paracentesis, an increase in PGE2 levels was noted along with elevations in inducible cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and nitrites and nitrates [15].",

The globe often appears red because of hyperemia of the deep perilimbal anterior ciliary vessels [3], [17]. The engorgement of these radially oriented vessels is called ciliary flush. The vascular dilation occurs secondary to the elevation in prostaglandin levels. Deep vessels may be distinguished from superficial conjunctival vessels by manipulation of the conjunctiva and application of 1:1000 epinephrine or 2.5% phenylephrine solution [17]. Deep vessels do not move with the conjunctiva and do not readily blanch after the application of topical epinephrine. Uveitis may result in corneal edema. Corneal edema may occur in association with uveitis as a result of reduction of the endothelial sodium potassium (NaK)-ATPase or epithelial Na-chlorine (Cl) pump activities or may be related to a rupture of the endothelial cell-cell junction barrier [18]. Either mechanism allows hydration of the corneal stroma noted clinically as corneal edema.",

Both may be noted during episodes of anterior uveitis. Aggregates of inflammatory cells may adhere to the corneal endothelium and are then called keratic precipitates (\nFig. 3). Typically, the keratic precipitates are visualized on the ventral one half to one third of the cornea, where they are deposited by the aqueous humor thermal convention currents. Blepharospasm or an elevated third eyelid may prevent visualization of the keratic precipitates by obscuring the ventral portion of the cornea. Larger fatty-looking clusters of keratic precipitates have been termed mutton fat keratic precipitates (\nFig. 4) and often indicate granulomatous inflammation [19].",

Areas of grayish discoloration over the tapetal fundus and grayish to white areas within the nontapetal fundus may occur as a result of retinal edema or cellular infiltration [13]. More extensive inflammation may result in areas of retinal detachment (\nFig. 5). The detachments may be bullous with a fluid exudate in the subretinal space, which allows visualization of the underlying tapetum (\nFig. 6). Retinal detachments may also be characterized by a cellular infiltrate in the subretinal space, which appears as grayish to pink-white accumulations of material beneath the retinal detachment. Hemorrhage may be present within the vitreous, retina, or subretinal space. Close inspection of the retinal vasculature may reveal changes in vascular caliber and tortuosity.

The inflammatory products within the aqueous humor cause degradation of the zonular fibers, which then allows the lens to move from its normal position within the patellar fossa [31]. Although this process seems to be relatively rare in dogs [32], chronic uveitis seems to be a frequent cause of lens luxation in the cat [33].

Therefore, atropine must be used with caution in patients that have or are at risk for secondary glaucoma. The cycloplegia greatly lessens the pain associated with ciliary spasm.

The initial frequency of application may be every 2 to 4 hours depending on the severity of the inflammation.

The NSAIDs block the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins by COX [52]. Prostaglandins are key mediators of ocular inflammation, causing breakdown of the BAB, exacerbating photophobia, and lowering the ocular pain threshold [53]. The NSAIDs are also beneficial because they have been shown to suppress polymorphonuclear cell locomotion and chemotaxis [54], decrease expression of inflammatory cytokines [55], and function as free radical scavengers [56]. Although many systemic NSAIDs are currently available, only a few have been evaluated to assess their efficacy in controlling ocular inflammation. Flunixin meglumine and aspirin have been shown to stabilize the BAB in experimental models of uveitis [57], [58]. Flunixin meglumine had good effects, whereas the effects of aspirin were moderate when compared with the placebo. Both drugs induced some gastrointestinal bleeding, however. In a pilocarpine-induced model of uveitis in dogs, carprofen resulted in a 68% inhibition of aqueous flare [59]. In a clinical study, tolfenamic acid was shown to control postoperative intraocular inflammation [60]. When selecting a systemic NSAID, one must be cognizant of the potential systemic side effects, particularly the adverse gastrointestinal effects in all species [61], and the potential for bone marrow suppression and hemorrhage in cats [62].",

The dogs with idiopathic uveitis were typically middle aged, did not exhibit any signs of systemic illness, and more often were presented with unilateral uveitis. In the study by Massa and colleagues [4], the degree of inflammation and ocular lesions did not vary between those dogs with infectious, neoplastic, or idiopathic uveitis. In studies of feline uveitis, approximately 30% to 62% of affected cats had no identifiable concurrent systemic disease [70], [71].

Two different forms of uveitis may be initiated by lenticular pathologic findings. A lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory process, termed phacolytic uveitis, occurs in association with hypermature or rapidly forming cataracts [31]. Phacolytic uveitis is typically mild. The prevalence has been reported to be as high as 71% in dogs screened for cataract surgery [73]. The high prevalence is not surprising, because fluorophotometric studies have demonstrated breakdown of the BAB in association with all stages of cataracts [74]. The lens-associated inflammation is proposed to occur after deviation of the normal low level of T-cell\u2013mediated tolerance to lens proteins [72], [75].",

Histologic examination of affected globes revealed intralenticular neutrophils and a surrounding inflammatory response that ranges from suppurative to lymphocytic in nature [76]. In a study by Davidson and colleagues [77], prompt surgical removal of the lens material resulted in a visual eye in most cases. In contrast, attempts at medical management resulted in the loss of vision. In cats, because of the risk for traumatic ocular sarcoma, surgical removal of the lens material or globe is recommended if the eye cannot be salvaged. Rupture of the lens capsule is believed to induce traumatic ocular sarcoma, although the time from trauma to detection of the tumor averages 5 years [5], [78].",

Hyphema and varying amounts of fibrin are often present in cases of traumatic uveitis [5]. In cases of penetrating trauma, one must assess the extent of damage within the globe, including whether the lens capsule has been ruptured. Ultrasonographic examination may be required to evaluate the extent of the damage fully. The administration of broad-spectrum systemic antibiotics is strongly suggested, because bacterial or fungal contamination may occur at the time of globe penetration [5]. Endophthalmitis can progress rapidly and cause loss of the globe. If marked hyphema is present, administration of tropicamide can mobilize the pupil and assist in preventing the development of synechia [5]. Administration of tropicamide is preferable to atropine, because tropicamide produces greater iridoplegia than cycloplegia, and thus less often produces increases in IOP [40].",

No systemic signs are associated with this condition. The mean age at presentation is 8.6 years [67]. In a report by Sapienza and colleagues [67], common sequelae were cataract formation (37%) and secondary glaucoma (46%). In a report by Deehr and Dubielzig [79], uveal cysts were noted in 15 of 18 eyes and were thought to be an important factor in the development of glaucoma. In the report by Sapienza and colleagues [67], uveal cysts were a common finding on histologic examination of the enucleated glaucomatous blind eyes, whereas they were only noted clinically in 13% of cases. Interestingly in those globes, microscopically, little inflammation was noted. Therapy often consists of combinations of topical and systemic corticosteroids, topical NSAIDs, medications to control secondary glaucoma, and azathioprine [67]. Administration of topical NSAIDs seems to exacerbate ocular hypertension frequently [65], [67].",

An immunohistochemical examination of affected tissues from two dogs revealed that the skin lesions were mediated by T cells and macrophages (T helper [Th] 1 immunity), whereas the ocular lesions were more consistent with a B-cell and macrophage response (Th2 immunity). The breeds primarily affected are the akita, samoyed, Siberian husky, and Shetland sheepdog [3]. The condition does occur sporadically in other breeds, however. Affected patients are usually presented with anterior uveitis or panuveitis characterized by iridal or choroidal depigmentation, bullous retinal detachment, or blindness [3]. The ocular lesions may precede the cutaneous lesions, which include poliosis and vitiligo of the facial mucocutaneous junctions, nasal planum, scrotum, and footpads [81], [82]. Generalized vitiligo may also occur [81]. Because of the chronic nature of the disease, affected patients typically develop extensive posterior synechia, iris bomb\u00e9, cataract, and secondary glaucoma. Immunosuppressive drugs are the mainstay of therapy [3]. Azathioprine is often combined with or substituted for corticosteroids to avoid the side effects associated with chronic systemic corticosteroid administration.",

Therefore, the possibility of associated neoplasia must always be considered in patients that have uveitis, particularly if the inflammatory response or secondary glaucoma precludes complete visualization of the intraocular compartments [83]. The more common primary intraocular tumors include melanomas (dogs and cats) [5], [84] and iridociliary epithelial tumors (dogs) [85]. Lymphosarcoma is the most frequent metastatic intraocular tumor in cats and dogs [5], [86], [87]. Ocular involvement in canine lymphoma may include anterior uveitis, posterior uveitis, panuveitis, retinal hemorrhage, and superficial disease [87]. Metastasis of angioinvasive pulmonary carcinoma has been described in four cats [88]. Ophthalmic examination revealed wedge-shaped tan discoloration of the tapetal fundus, variable but mild serous exudation under the retina, and profoundly attenuated retinal vasculature [88].",

The associated clinical signs include febrile episodes, weight loss, anorexia, depression, debility, and variable thoracic and abdominal involvement [5]. The uveitis associated with FIP is typically a panuveitis or panophthalmitis with diffuse and severe corneal edema, marked anterior uveitis, marked cellular infiltration of the vitreous (ie, vitritis), chorioretinitis, inflammatory retinal detachments, or optic neuritis [5]. Mutton fat keratic precipitates with occasional admixed hemorrhage occur most often with FIP because of the granulomatous nature of the infection. The granulomatous periphlebitis may be noted as perivascular cuffing surrounding the retinal vasculature.",

According to recommendations from the FIP workshop symposium [92], the first step in establishing a diagnosis of FIP is to compare the signalment, history, and clinical findings with those of the typical individual infected with FIP. Most cats with FIP are from 6 months to 3 years of age, come from shelters or catteries, and show signs of cyclic antibiotic-resistant fevers and specific physical manifestations depending on the form of the disease and location of lesions [92]. Diagnostic test findings supportive of a diagnosis of FIP include characteristic analysis of peritoneal or pleural effusions, leukocytosis with neutrophilia and lymphopenia, hyperglobulinemia, hypoalbuminemia, increased fibrinogen, and nonregenerative anemia of chronic disease [92]. Finally, in a cat with suspect FIP, one may also submit effusions or surgical biopsies for immunohistochemistry or RT-PCR [92]. Serology or RT-PCR performed on serum samples can confirm exposure to feline coronavirus but must be paired with appropriate clinical signs to ensure an accurate diagnosis [92]. No therapy has been proved effective in the management of FIP [92]. Therapy remains symptomatic.",

Since the initial report, Ketring and colleagues [93] have demonstrated elevated serum antibody production against Bartonella in cats with uveitis. In a more recent study by Fontanelle and colleagues [94], however, healthy cats were more likely to have elevated Bartonella titers than cats with uveitis. Therefore, serum antibody tests alone do not seem to be sufficient to confirm a diagnosis of Bartonella-induced uveitis. A definitive therapeutic protocol to resolve Bartonella infection does not currently exist [95], [96]. The authors of one article [93] suggest azithromycin, doxycycline, or rifampin.",

            "text": "Direct viral damage of ocular tissues, initiation of secondary immune phenomena, or opportunistic infection secondary to immunosuppression may all contribute to the uveitis associated with FIV infection [102]. Clinically, pars planitis is often a significant feature of the disease, creating a \u201csnow banking\u201d phenomenon as cells are deposited throughout the anterior vitreous with a greater density toward the periphery [102]. Keratic precipitates are uncommon findings [102]. Coinfection with Toxoplasma gondii seems to increase the severity of clinical signs in cats that are infected with FIV [71], [103], perhaps because the defense mechanisms for T gondii depend on CD4+ cells [103]. ELISA tests may be used to detect antibodies to FIV [104]. According to a recent study [105], the Snap Combo Plus (IDEXX Laboratories, Atlanta, GA) is the best performing in-hospital test kit, and the MAPIC FIV test (Sinovus Biotech, Inc., Lund, Sweden) should not be used because of the large number of invalid results or results that are difficult to interpret. Unfortunately, vaccination of cats for FIV produces antibodies that are indistinguishable from those used to diagnose FIV infection [104]. Currently, there is no method by which to differentiate vaccinal antibodies from those produced by natural infection. Therefore, attaining a definitive diagnosis in a cat whose vaccination status is unknown becomes nearly impossible. Symptomatic therapy is used to control the uveitis.",

Because a histologic diagnosis is frequently not available, however, serologic testing is the primary diagnostic modality. Exposure to the organism is widespread within the feline population. Therefore, paired serologic titers are recommended, and most cases remain suspect rather than confirmed [106]. An ELISA test for IgM antibodies with a single titer greater than 1:256 or rising IgG titers is considered consistent with an active infection [108], [109]. More recently, PCR (B1 gene) tests for T gondii\u2013specific IgM and IgG have been evaluated in serum and aqueous humor samples [110], [111]. T gondii\u2013specific IgM or IgG was detected in the serum but not in the aqueous humor in 34.8% of healthy cats. In cats that had uveitis, T gondii\u2013specific IgM or IgG was detected in the serum of 72% and in the aqueous humor of 39.5%, suggesting that the combination of serum and aqueous humor T gondii titers may be the most informative and useful method of testing. Anti-inflammatory therapy should be used to control the uveitis in conjunction with clindamycin hydrochloride at a dose of 12.5 mg/kg administered orally twice daily for 14 to 21 days [112].",

From the literature, the incidence of blastomycosis in cats seems to be rare, except for sporadic clusters [117], [118]. In most cases, hematogenous spread is the likely route of ocular involvement. Ocular cryptococcosis seems to be an exception, however, because extension from the central nervous system occurs more frequently. The diagnostic protocol for mycotic uveitides includes a complete physical examination, hematology, and clinical chemistries [5]. Diagnosis is often achieved by identification of the organism during cytologic examination of aspirates or impression smears from lymph nodes, bone marrow aspirates, cerebrospinal fluid, or cutaneous lesions [5]. Aqueous or vitreous paracentesis may be useful depending on the degree of ocular involvement (ie, anterior or posterior segment) [5]. Histoplasmosis may be effectively treated using itraconazole [119]. Blastomycosis may be treated with itraconazole or fluconazole, although the response is often poor [117], [118].",

Endophthalmitis, chorioretinitis, and hyphema have all been reported in association with Brucella canis infection [121]. Vinayak and colleagues [121] reported that 14.2% of patients that had B canis infection demonstrated ocular signs. Other clinical signs include reproductive tract lesions (eg, abortions, epididymitis, failure to conceive) [120], diskospondylitis, osteomyelitis, splenomegaly, glomerulopathy, and meningoencephalitis [122], [123]. Isolation of the organism is considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d diagnostic test [120]. This can be difficult, however. The rapid slide agglutination test is sensitive and can be performed early in the stage of infection [120]. Positive results are confirmed with other tests, including the tube agglutination test, agar-gel immunodiffusion, indirect fluorescent antibody test, and ELISA [122]. Achieving complete eradication of the organism is difficult [120]. Various suggested therapeutic regimens include minocycline and streptomycin, tetracycline and streptomycin, long-acting oxytetracycline [120], enrofloxacin [124], and gentamicin [121]. Complete resolution of ocular clinical signs and clearance of the organism have only been reported in one case in the literature [121].",

The ocular lesions are similar and include anterior uveitis, hyphema, retinal hemorrhage, and retinal detachment (see Fig. 7). The diagnosis is typically based on the combination of clinical signs and serologic testing. Serum ELISA and IFA serologic tests can be used to document exposure to Lyme disease [126]. In patients previously vaccinated for Lyme disease, Western blot immunoassays may be used to differentiate natural exposure from vaccinal response [126]. The serum fluorescent antibody test is most reliable for the diagnosis of ehrlichial agents [125]. IFA and ELISA serum antibody titers are available for the diagnosis of RMSF [125]. The current therapeutic recommendations are also similar. Doxycycline is administered at a dosage of 10 mg/kg every 24 hours for 1 month as the primary therapy for Lyme disease in patients with positive serology and clinical signs of disease [126]. Two case reports document favorable responses to administration of doxycycline, sometimes paired with anti-inflammatory doses of corticosteroids in cases of canine ehrlichiosis [127], [128]. Doxycycline is also used in the therapy of RMSF, and combination with systemic prednisolone has not been shown to decrease efficacy [129].",

Reported cases have had anterior uveitis [122] and, in one case, bilateral serous retinal detachment [132]. The diagnosis is most commonly achieved using a serum microscopic agglutination test. A single high titer or rising titers are considered indicative of infection [133], [134], [135], [136], [137] Therapy is directed toward elimination of the organism. High doses of penicillin, ampicillin, and amoxicillin can clear the leptospiremia phase, usually within hours of administration [138]. These drugs do not eliminate the carrier state, however [133], [134]. Current recommendations are to use a 2-week course of doxycycline to clear the carrier state in dogs [138].",

Patients may be presented with anterior uveitis, chorioretinitis, panuveitis, endophthalmitis, or optic neuritis. A complete physical examination with particular attention to the cutaneous examination, thoracic auscultation, and abdominal palpation can aid in establishing a diagnosis. As discussed previously, cytologic identification of the organism within aspirates or impression smears is the gold standard for establishing a diagnosis. Serologic tests are available. The latex cryptococcal agglutination test detects cryptococcal antigen and can be a useful test for establishing a diagnosis and monitoring the response to therapy. The serologic tests for histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, and cocciciomycosis detect antibody production. False-negative responses, at least for blastomycosis, are not uncommon [141]. The preferred systemic therapy for each type of mycosis varies [3]. The current preferred therapy for blastomycosis is the administration of itraconazole [142]. Although many clinicians do not advocate systemic corticosteroid treatment in dogs with systemic mycoses [143], a recent retrospective study of dogs infected with blastomycosis by Finn and colleagues [144] did not note any change in survival times and suggested that combination therapy of systemic prednisone and itraconazole may have assisted in the maintenance of vision.",

            "text": "The clinical signs of uveitis occur as a result of inflammation within the vascular coat of the eye, which causes breakdown of the BAB and blood-retinal barrier. Clinical signs include blepharospasm, photophobia, conjunctival hyperemia, circumlimbal corneal vascularization, corneal edema, aqueous flare, inflammatory cells within the anterior chamber, keratic precipitates, iridal congestion, ocular hypotony, retinal hemorrhage, and retinal detachment. Sequelae to uveitis include cataracts, posterior synechiae, secondary glaucoma, and retinal degeneration. Many infectious and noninfectious causes can incite episodes of uveitis. Therefore, complete ocular and physical examinations are recommended for all patients that have uveitis. A complete blood cell count, serum biochemistry profile, urinalysis, thoracic radiographs, and select serologic tests may be performed in an effort to identify any underlying etiologic agents. Despite exhaustive workups, however, the underlying cause is not determined in many cases. The goals of therapy are preserving vision if possible, minimizing pain, and halting inflammation. Additional therapeutic agents may be used if the underlying etiologic agent can be identified.",
