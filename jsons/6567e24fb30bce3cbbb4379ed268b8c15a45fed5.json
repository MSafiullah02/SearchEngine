Upper respiratory viral infections are associated with the majority of such disease exacerbations. The past few years have seen advances in the mechanisms by which viral infections induce pro-inflammatory chemokine production, and in our understanding of host antiviral and anti-inflammatory defence pathways that might regulate responses to infection. A more comprehensive understanding of the molecular basis of these processes could elucidate new therapeutic approaches to reduce the devastating impact that these exacerbations have on quality of life and healthcare costs.",

Exacerbations of both asthma and COPD represent a major financial burden on the healthcare system as a result of costs associated with hospitalizations, increased medication usage, and days lost from work and school. In the case of asthma, exacerbations are responsible for 50% of the total healthcare costs, and for the deaths of 5000 Americans each year [3] . Similarly in the case of COPD, exacerbations account for 70% of healthcare costs, as well as being a substantial cause of hospitalizations [3] . More importantly, recurrent exacerbations of COPD result in a loss of lung function, thus hastening the progression of a currently fatal disease [4] .",

Indeed, URIs are the principal risk factor associated with asthma exacerbations [3, 7] , and are associated with as many as 80-85% of asthma exacerbations in children and adolescents [5, [8] [9] [10] , and approximately 40-60% of exacerbations in adults [3, 5] . There is a clear temporal relationship between URIs and asthma exacerbations in children. The peak of hospitalizations occurs in September, shortly after the return to school and at the peak time of year for human rhinovirus (HRV) infections [10, 11] . Consistent with this, HRV is associated with approximately 60% of viral-triggered exacerbations [6, 10, 12] . Other viral types associated with asthma exacerbations include influenza, coronaviruses, parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus. Epidemiological evidence suggests that viruses may also interact with other causal factors linked to asthma exacerbations, such as allergens and pollution. Studies of the interaction between experimental allergen exposure and experimental virus infection, however, have generated mixed results. In a murine model, influenza infection aids allergen sensitisation and enhances airway inflammation [13] . In humans, however, chronic low-dose allergen provocations did not alter subsequent lower airway responses to HRV infection [14] whereas, in the upper airways, acute allergen challenge delayed onset and shortened the duration of common colds.",

            "text": "By 2020, COPD is predicted to become the third most common cause of death worldwide and the fifth leading cause of disability [15] . Exacerbations of COPD occur more commonly in patients in the advanced GOLD II or III stages [16] . (GOLD stands for the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, and ranks disease in four stages: 0 = at risk; stage I = mild COPD; stage II = moderate COPD; stage III = severe COPD.) Recent evidence has demonstrated that URIs are a major trigger [17] . In a recent study, 78% of severe exacerbations in patients with COPD were associated with viral and/or bacterial infections, with viral infections accounting for 48% of these exacerbations [18] . Interestingly, viral-associated exacerbations of COPD are more frequent, severe and have longer recovery times than those of non-viral origin [17] . Moreover, exacerbations associated with viral/bacterial co-infection also result in longer hospitalisation, and worse functional impairment for the patient [16] . In patients with COPD exacerbations requiring mechanical ventilation, a viral pathogen was detected in 46% of cases [19] . In general, viral infections are responsible for approximately 50% of exacerbations of COPD, with HRV being the dominant pathogen [3, 5] . Consistent with this, exacerbation frequency is associated with an increased frequency of acquiring the 'common cold' [20] . Moreover, experimental HRV infection in patients with GOLD stage II COPD resulted in symptoms and lung function changes representative of acute disease exacerbations [21] .",

Growing evidence, however, suggests direct infection of the lower respiratory tract, leading to a robust host inflammatory response, and an increase in bronchial hyperresponsiveness [6] . Because HRV is the major viral type associated with exacerbations, we focus on this virus as a prototype for the mechanisms by which viruses exert their effects. HRV infects both the upper and lower respiratory tracts, with the principal site of infection being the airway epithelial cell [22] . Although it has been reported that some strains of HRV can cause epithelial cell death in cultures grown at low density [23] , the majority of studies found no overt cytotoxicity either in vitro or in vivo. Epithelial cells are clearly the major site of HRV infection and sustain prolonged replication [24, 25] . Although HRV can bind to, and enter, a variety of other cell types in vitro, including fibroblasts, monocytes and macrophages [25, 26] , the contribution of these individual cell types to pathogenesis in vivo is still unclear.",

Induction of chemokines such as IL-8 occurs early after HRV binding and does not require viral replication, but instead depends upon activation of both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway [30] . Given that intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), the receptor for the majority of HRV serotypes, has no inherent kinase activity or recognition motifs for receptorassociated kinases, it was unclear how viral binding initiated this signalling cascade. However, it has recently been shown that HRV binding to ICAM-1 leads to an association with the spleen tyrosine kinase Syk. This association is mediated via the cytoskeletal linker protein ezrin, which binds both ICAM-1 and Syk. Formation of this complex leads to activation of Syk, with subsequent downstream activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and increased expression of IL-8. Thus, Syk is an important signalling component in early virus responses [31 ] .",

This has led to intense investigation of the role of viral replication products, particularly double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), in cell responses. It is known that dsRNA mimics several responses to viral infection and triggers host anti-viral responses. Initially, dsRNA was thought to be recognized exclusively by Toll-like receptor (TLR)3 [32] , but genetic deletion of TLR3 did not alter viral pathogenesis or host adaptive antiviral responses to several viruses [33] . This apparent conundrum was resolved with the demonstration that two intracellular RNA helicases -retinoic acid inducible gene (RIG-I) [34, 35 ] and melanomadifferentiation-associated gene 5 (mda-5) [35 ] -can also bind to dsRNA. The helicase domain of these proteins binds dsRNA, while a caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) permits binding of a downstream adaptor protein. This downstream mitochondrial-associated protein was identified independently by four groups and is known by the names CARDIF (CARD adapter inducing interferon-b), MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signalling), IPS-1 (interferon-b promoter stimulator-1) and VISA (virus-induced signalling adapter) [36 ] . CARDIF binds to several proteins and induces both classical nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) pathway activation and IKKe/Tankbinding kinase 1-mediated activation of interferon response factors [36 ] . These pathways are also activated when dsRNA binds to TLR3 (Figure 2) . Controversy now exists regarding the relative roles of TLR3, RIG-I and mda-5 in viral recognition. It has been suggested that different viral types may preferentially utilize one of these three recognition proteins. To further complicate this picture, RIG-I also recognizes single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) containing 5 0 -phosphates. Indeed, it has been reported that influenza A does not generate dsRNA but, rather, activates RIG-I via binding of genomic viral ssRNA bearing 5 0 -phosphates [37 ,38 ] . Further studies are needed to clarify the preferential utilization of different intracellular recognition molecules by different viral types, and to determine if this also varies with cell type. Mechanisms of virus-associated exacerbations of asthma and COPD. Viral infection of the epithelium results in the upregulation of ICAM-1. Pro-inflammatory mediators are also released that recruit inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and monocytes, which then differentiate into macrophages, lymphocytes and eosinophils. These inflammatory cells also release inflammatory mediators such as chemokines, cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which perpetuate the inflammatory response culminating in an exacerbation.",

Those subjects whose underlying disease is well controlled are less likely to experience an acute viralmediated exacerbation. Similarly, pre-existing specific immunity to a given pathogen will reduce the likelihood of that pathogen triggering an exacerbation. Epithelial contributions to host innate antiviral immunity might also play a role. Recent reports suggest that bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatic subjects show impaired production of both IFNb and type 3 IFNs [39 ,40 ] , and that this plays a role in the increased susceptibility of asthmatic subjects to lower airway disease. Additional studies are needed to confirm these data and to put such defects in the context of why specific asthmatic subjects experience exacerbations. Moreover, although type 1 and type 3 IFNs contribute to host defence mainly via induction of numerous IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that collectively limit virus replication and spread, there is a precedent for several viruses, including HRV, to induce ISGs independently of IFN induction [24, 41] . Overview of the intracellular signalling pathway stimulated by rhinovirus. HRV binds to ICAM-1 on the surface of epithelial cells. The virus becomes internalised and, during replication, produces dsRNA. dsRNA can then bind TLR3, which activates Toll/IL-1-containing adaptor inducing interferon b (TRIF) and subsequently either interferon regulatory factor (IRF) or NF-kB. dsRNA can also bind either RIG-I or mda-5, resulting in the activation of IRFor NF-kB-mediated pathways.

Corticosteroids are ineffective in the treatment of HRVinduced colds and current evidence would suggest that they are of limited efficacy in viral-induced excerbations of asthma. Asthmatics with prominent sputum neutrophilia, perhaps indicative of viral etiology, are poorly responsive to inhaled corticosteroids [45] , and inhaled corticoisteroids did not significantly reduce lower airway inflammation induced by HRV infection of asthmatic subjects [46] . Moreover, administration of prednisolone to children hospitalized for viral-induced episodes of wheezy bronchiolitis did not reduce the duration of hospital stay [47] . Combination therapies of inhaled anticholinergic agents with short-acting b2-adrenoceptor agonists have been reported to be more effective against exacerbations in school children [44] ; furthermore, a leukotriene receptor antagonist decreased asthma exacerbations in 2-to 5-year-old patients with intermittent asthma [48] . Nedocromil sodium and inhaled corticosteroids might also be of limited benefit in asthma exacerbations in children [49] . It must be noted, however, that most of these studies did not discriminate between exacerbations of viral and non-viral origin.",

Combined therapy with corticosteroids and long-acting b-adrenoceptor agonists has been shown to reduce the number of exacerbations in patients with COPD, presumably by improving baseline control [50] . Again, however, there have been no studies specifi-cally examining the effects of corticosteroids, alone or in combination with long-acting b-adrenoceptor agonists, during COPD exacerbations of known viral etiology. Similarly, although antibiotic therapy is widely used in exacerbations of COPD, their utility in virally triggered exacerbations is questionable. Antiviral approaches appear to be a logical alternative to the treatment of viral exacerbations of asthma and COPD, and influenza vaccine is clearly effective in preventing exacerbations triggered by this virus. Vaccination approaches have not been successful for respiratory syncytial virus, however, and are not feasible for HRV, given the large number of viral serotypes. Antiviral agents are available for influenza, and neuraminidase inhibitors have proven clinical efficacy in reducing the severity of symptoms during influenza infections. By contrast, antiviral approaches targeting HRV are still in development and have not yet been applied to viral exacerbations of asthma or COPD.",

The first would be to identify specific viral signaling pathways that would be targets for intervention. These could include, for example, specific early signaling pathways involving the spleen tyrosine kinase Syk, or pathways triggered by viral interactions with the intracellular RNA helicases. Although targeting specific chemokines or chemokine receptors, such as CXCR3 or CXCR1/2, might also prove an attractive target, it remains to be determined which chemokine/chemokine-receptor systems are particularly important in disease pathogenesis. Finally, enhancement of endogenous host antiviral pathways, or topical administration of drugs such as nitric oxide donors, could provide alternative approaches to reduce virally induced inflammation.",

In addition, better understanding of host innate antiviral mechanisms could provide an alternative therapeutic approach if such pathways can be stimulated.",
