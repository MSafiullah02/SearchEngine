Thus, RT plays a key role in the viral life cycle and is therefore an important target for antiretroviral drugs such as nucleoside (NRTI) and nucleotide (NtRTI) RT inhibitors [1]. During RT-mediated conversion of viral genomic RNA into proviral DNA, nucleoside and nucleotide analogs can fool RT which can use their 5\u2032-triphosphate form as a substrate. Because these analogs lack a 3\u2032-OH group, DNA chain termination occurs and accounts for an antiretroviral effect.",

Therefore, NtRTIs require only two phosphorylation steps to be converted into their diphosphate active form [4]. Hence, NtRTIs bypass the often rate-limiting nucleoside-kinase step that is known to moderate the activity of NRTIs [5]. To date, only two ANPs have been approved as antiretroviral drugs. Adefovir [9-(2-Phosphonomethoxyethyl)adenine, PMEA] was originally developed for its potential in the treatment of HIV, but its prodrug adefovir dipivoxil proved to be nephrotoxic [6] at the dosage required to efficiently inhibit HIV replication. However, adefovir was subsequently approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infections at a lower dosage of administration [3]. Tenofovir [(R)-9-(2-Phosphonomethoxypropyl)-adenine, (R)-PMPA [7], referred hereinafter as PMPA], administered as the prodrug tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, is nowadays one of the most widely prescribed anti-HIV drugs in the US and Europe. Recently, tenofovir was also approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B [8], [9].",

Little attention has been given to explore the phosphonate moiety modifications, and efforts were mainly focused on prodrug synthesis [17], [18]. Therefore, we decided to explore the different modifications of the phosphonate group and we designed the substitution of one of the oxygen atoms bearing by the phosphorus by several groups and atoms. In 2006, we developed an original method to synthesize an H-phosphinate intermediate [19] that can easily serve as a precursor to generate phosphorus-modified nucleotides. This key step was first applied to synthesize nucleoside \u03b1-boranophosphonate [19], [20], [21] and nucleoside \u03b1-selenophosphonate (unstable compounds, data not published) derived from PMEA and PMPA.",

In addition, the antiviral potential of the compounds 3 and 4 was evaluated by monitoring the reduction of the cytopathic effect of a broad panel of DNA and RNA viruses. Then, we evaluated the stability of our compounds 3 and 4 under conditions mimicking biological fluids. These novel antiviral nucleoside \u03b1-thiophosphonates are patented by us [22].",

Intermediates are then coupled by nucleophilic substitution to diethyl[[(p-toluenesulfonyl)oxy]methyl]phosphonate, prepared beforehand, to lead to the corresponding diethylphosphonates.

These results show that thiophosphonates are able to penetrate cells, to be phosphorylated and to efficiently inhibit HIV-1 replication (subtype B). Antiviral activity is also observed in CEM and in PBMC cell cultures infected with a similar viral load (100 TCID50), indicating that thiophosphonates are able to inhibit HIV-1 replication in other T-lymphocyte cell cultures as well, including primary cells. However, higher EC50 values are obtained with S-PMEA 3 and S-PMPA 4 as well as reference compounds PMEA and PMPA in CEM- and PBMC-infected cells, suggesting that the difference between the two cell types could be attributed to different origin and/or activation states for each cell-type and therefore different phosphorylation properties of NtRTI or cellular uptake. The thiophosphonates are also effective against HIV-2 (Table 1). S-PMPA 4 tends to be somewhat more active than S-PMEA 3. With a 50-fold higher multiplicity of infection (MOI) in H9 cells, activity of thiophosphonates as well as the non-thiophosphonates is affected, as expected, with increased EC50 values from 7- to 25-fold. Thus, these results show that the difference between thio and non-thiophosphonates remained constant independently from the MOI virus input. However, it should be noticed that the standard deviation for a number of EC50 values were rather high, being possibly due to inter-individual variability between PBMC donors, and masking potential subtle differences in antiviral potency between the compounds.",

Studies were performed on a column Nova-pak C18 (4 mm, 3.9 \u00d7 150 mm) + precolumn Nova-pack C18 (100 \u00c5) with an on-line filtration system. Samples were eluted using a linear gradient of 0.05 M triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer in 100% water (pH 7.5) (buffer A) to a 0.05 M triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer in 50% acetonitrile (buffer B), programmed over a 60 min period with a flow rate of 1 mL/min and detection at 260 nm. The crude sample (50 mL) is injected into the precolumn and eluted with buffer A during 5 min. Then, the switching valve for connecting the precolumn to the column is activated and a linear gradient from 0% buffer B to 20% over 40 min is applied. The retention times are 25.6 min for S-PMEA 3, 29.5 min for S-PMPA 4, 24.3 min for PMEA, and 27.7 min for PMPA. The amount of remaining parent compound at each time point was used to determine the half-life of the compound. The product of decomposition from parent derivative is determined by comparison with authentic samples and reference compounds.",
