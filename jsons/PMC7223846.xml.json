            "text": "This study and the research questions were developed using ambiguous loss and contextual family stress theory (Boss, 1980, 1993). Stress related to ambiguous loss and role ambiguity in foster parents has been a topic explored by other researchers (Hebert et al., 2013; Thompson & McArthur, 2009; Urquhart, 1989; Whiting & Huber, 2007). However, more research, as well as more recent research, is needed to examine the unique experiences that foster parents have when dealing with the experience of a foster child being removed from their home. According to Whiting and Huber (2007), foster parents may be hesitant to develop a closer relationship to a foster child because they recognize that a child would likely remain with them for only a short amount of time. Another study found that foster parents who had discontinued fostering reported they had less support from the agency and did not feel like they, as foster parents, were involved in the decision-making process when the child left (Urquhart, 1989).",

For example, some foster parents experience the removal of a child due to an abuse allegation. Within this context, Thompson and McArthur (2009) found that foster parents exhibited ambiguity as they wondered whether the child would come back to the foster home again. Ambiguity also exists after children leave the foster home. Examples include foster parents ruminating over how their foster children are faring, and coming to recognize that they know nothing about their foster child\u2019s future (Hebert et al., 2013; Thompson & McArthur, 2009; Whiting & Huber, 2007). Despite these initial attempts to document stress experiences, a more in-depth exploration of the experience and context of a foster child\u2019s removal from the home is needed.",

Participants were asked to choose a private place such as their home, church, office, or a library in order to help ensure their confidentiality. The first author conducted the audio-recorded interviews at the homes of nine participants and at one participant\u2019s place of employment. The consent form stated that interviews would be audio-recorded; however, the first author repeated the consent information prior to the actual interview and obtained verbal permission to audio record prior to each interview. To ensure confidentiality, no others were present in the room besides the participant and the first author when the interview took place. Participants were given the opportunity to stop the interview at any time to ensure they did not feel coerced to participate. Due to the sensitive nature of the study, the interviewer ensured that participants had a copy of the consent form with the first author\u2019s contact information after each interview in case the participant needed any additional support following the interviews. Participants were not compensated for participation as funding was not available for renumeration. The interviews consisted of semi-structured, open-ended questions, and each interview ranged from 23 to 60 min. Audio recordings were reviewed by the first author in order to gain the social and emotional aspects of the interview situation (Creswell, 1998; Kvale & Brinkmann, 2009). Participants were asked to respond to the following four research questions:How did you experience of having a foster child removed from your home, whether the removal was scheduled or unscheduled?What formal training about grief and loss did you receive from your child welfare workers or foster agencies that helped you cope with the experience?How did you and your family cope with your grief and loss following the removal of your foster children?How did your experiences of having your foster child removed affect your desire to foster in the future?",

A priori codes were developed by the first author of this study using both previous literature and the data generated by the four research questions in this study. In order to confirm the codes were appropriate, the researcher then consulted with the second author of this study to code two transcribed interviews using the a priori codes. After codes were discussed, refined, and no true discrepancies were noted, the researcher then trained a graduate student how to code the data. The graduate student read an article and practiced coding with the researcher until it was clear the student could independently code. After the two independent coders finished analyzing the data, the researcher and graduate student cross-checked the data to determine that the same codes were derived independently. Although there were no discrepancies since the codes were already formulated, the coders identified points in the data that needed a more specific or descriptive codes. In these situations coders discussed the codes until a more refined resolution was agreed upon. The researcher used this coding process to develop themes that gave a textural description of the experiences reported by the sample (Creswell, 2009; Moustakas, 1994).",

Validation of the data analysis procedures was achieved by using member checking and peer debriefing (Creswell & Miller, 2000). The researcher sent transcripts with specific highlighted themes to four participants by email for member checking (only four participants agreed to participate in member checking; Creswell, 2009). All participants selected by the researcher returned the transcripts indicating that they felt the researcher had captured their meaning accurately. Peer debriefing was achieved by reviewing the data with the second author of this study (Creswell, 2009; Creswell & Miller, 2000).

Several of the foster parents identified that they struggled with the physical absence of their foster child and had to find means of managing the move or removal, before and after the child was gone. During interview, some parents even showed the primary researcher the pictures of the children that they kept displayed prominently in their homes, baby books, and other mementos. At the beginning of her interview Karen reported, \u201cthere are a number of pictures here of my family but there are also pictures of all the kids I\u2019ve had in my home and I keep them out.\u201d Janet emphatically stated that they would like to see foster children \u201cagain 1 day when they are older to see how they are doing and let them know that they were, at one time, a part of this child\u2019s life\u201d. Foster parents also reported that they were able to cope with the loss more effectively if they felt the foster children were going back to a safe environment. When comparing her most recent foster child removal with a previous one Lucy discussed:The first one was a bit easier because we knew that the grandmother, even though she initially said she couldn\u2019t handle [him] was, what\u2019s the nice word, [she was] stable. You know, she was a good home for him. And he was going with his other half siblings. But the last one, I mean everyone said that they weren\u2019t sure that it was a good home\u2026 if the official people are saying that we kind of got an idea that it was not a great place for [the children] to live. So that\u2019s what makes it hard.Other foster parents reported that seeking emotional closure was important, such as finding appropriate ways of saying goodbye to the children before they the home. When Lucy found out the two brothers she was fostering were leaving the home she told the interviewer, \u201cwe did fun things. Asked the kids what they wanted to do before they left. So we went to the zoo and [did] other things\u201d. Other participants noted the importance of including friends and family. For example, Martha discussed having her friends come say goodbye before foster children left. \u201c[My friends] almost always come over the night before to say goodbye. We\u2019ve had several of those\u2026 Fred\u2019s leaving tomorrow and people will stop by and give him a hug.\u201d Other foster parents reported that putting items away such as car seats and toys helped to provide some emotional closure for them after the foster child left. When speaking to a difficult loss Sara stated, \u201cI guess a part of closure was taking car seats out and putting them away in the garage. I think that is when we said they\u2019re not here anymore.\u201d",

            "text": "Participants indicated that it was important for them to engage in self-care to manage their stress and deal with their grief. Foster parents indicated that when they experienced the loss of a foster child through removal it was important to have a break to grieve before another foster child entered the home. Unfortunately, all too often, the foster parent was asked by the agency to take another child very soon after the other child had been removed. Lastly, multiple foster parents indicated that they needed their personal faith to get through moves and removals. For example, Lucy reported:Knowing that God sees from beginning to end and He knows the comings and goings over our house, and also watches over the kids [helps us as foster parents]\u2026 So even if it doesn\u2019t make sense to me, somehow, I have to hope that it will all make sense in the end.Lastly, the foster parents in this study did not report much difference in their experiences related to scheduled and unscheduled losses, and some found that the ability to reframe the loss as a positive experience for the child was helpful in managing their reactions. When asked if she thought the removal of a foster child was challenging, Martha reported that she felt as if she was like:A paramedic that comes on the scene of an accident\u2026they come in and they stabilize the patient, take them to the hospital and they leave. And they turn them over to the doctor and they leave. I just here right now for this time I am needed and then I relinquish them and turn them over to the next phase\u2026 I am off to the next baby but that doesn\u2019t diminish that these babies are real humans that I love.Multiple foster parents identified that the impact of a move or removal of their foster child extended beyond them, as the foster parent. Participants spoke about the relationship their adoptive and/or biological children had with the foster children who entered their homes, as many of their children had trouble coping with the loss of their foster sibling. Only two participants reported that, at times, their biological children had problems adjusting to having foster children in the home. When speaking about the removal of one of her foster children, Karen stated:I closed my home for a while after [one removal]. I think I went through a normal grieving process, but more for my son because he lost his brother basically. You know they just, the two of them did everything together. They went to the same day cares. They did all the same stuff together, you know.Foster parents also mentioned that the removal of a foster child from the home impacted their adult children as well. Lynn described how her two adult daughters reacted to the removal of Lynn\u2019s foster children, and how it influenced their relationship.I think [my daughters] were more concerned with me getting hurt over [children\u2019s names redacted]. [For my daughters], it was like oh my God I can\u2019t even imagine how you could do this cause now they\u2019d experienced being a mom and fostering changed the dynamics [of the family] if that makes sense.As can be expected, participants discussed how fostering impacted their relationships with significant others. Some foster parents indicated that the removal of a foster child caused stress in their relationships while others stated it strengthened their romantic relationships. When speaking of her husband, Joann, a foster parent of 2 years said, \u201cand he misses them too\u2026 but I think [the loss] helped us more than divided us. It helped us to grow closer together.\u201d Foster parents also reported that the loss of the foster child negatively affected their adult family members including their parents and siblings as well as friendships. Lucy disclosed her parents had a hard time with a loss. She stated:[Losing] the two boys, I think that was another really hard thing for my parents. I mean they were attached. They don\u2019t even live here. They live in [state redacted] but they were attached to them. So just seeing that our decision to foster, which was our family\u2019s decision, hurts other people\u2026 I remember my mom saying why are you wanting to do that, you know? You\u2019re going to lose some of them, but that hurt to know that we were not causing pain but kind of bringing that into their lives. [Something] that they didn\u2019t ask for.When discussing friendships, the reports were mixed. Some foster parents reported that their friends were supportive while others felt that their friends were upset to see them hurting and did not understand why they continued to foster.",

Only three foster parents reported receiving either online or face-to-face continuing education training related to foster parent grief. When asked about training Karen reported, \u201c[preservice training] is more on how to handle the kids, the process of adopting, but that\u2019s something we do need to address, grief and loss. And I think individually we all go through it.\u201d A few participants in this study felt it was more important to have training on this subject after they had been fostering a while instead of in preservice training. Some participants have reached out to other foster parents support. When speaking about the support group she attends, Joann stated:We\u2019ve gone to other things but when we\u2019ve [gathered] foster parents together to share their experiences, that\u2019s when we have learned the most about what to expect or not to expect, or how it\u2019s really supposed to be\u2026Other foster parents reported that it was helpful to hear how more experienced foster parents had managed their losses or that senior foster parents taught them ways to effectively manage grief when a foster child leaves the home.

When asked what was needed from child welfare agencies to help foster parents prepare for losses Robert reported, \u201cWhat would really be nice is some counseling services\u2026.You know I think some grief services would be very, very helpful.\u201d Others identified that the support of the child care worker, communication, the ability to say goodbye to the child prior to the removal, and having time to cope with the loss prior to having another child enter the home were also important means of managing loss. Foster parents indicated they wanted changes to be made to the foster care system, such as increased communication and more emotional support from agency workers, particularly for helping them manage the grief and loss of having a foster child removed. Laura reported the following:You know I think it\u2019s so important that agencies support their foster families, not just through this required training but by having resources available, you know, when a child leaves or whatever.Foster parents in this study reported that they desired having more clear communication with agency workers and much more support surrounding the removal of the foster child from the home.

Unlike previous studies, foster parents in this study noted that although they felt sad at the physical absence of the child after the foster child was removed from their home, they worked hard to keep the child psychologically present in their family. Others have identified that foster parents experience ambiguity when they think and talk about the uncertain future of their foster child after the child was removed from their home (Hebert et al., 2013). Boss (1999, 2006) has found that people who experience ambiguity related to physical loss often keep the family member psychologically present in their minds. According to family stress theory, when a person (e.g., a foster child) is physically absent the remaining family members (i.e., foster parents) might cope by continuing to focus on the psychological presence of the child in the household (Boss, 1999, 2006).",

Other foster parents in this study reported concerns about whether the child was going home to a safe environment.

Foster parents reported that they needed their personal faith, emotional closure, and self-care opportunities to help them manage their stress. Consistent with previous research (Hebert et al., 2013), several foster parents reported that faith in a higher power was an important factor in helping them manage their stress, especially related to the loss of a foster child through removal. This was one of the first studies to discuss how foster parents actively tried to obtain emotional closure. For example, participants described doing things their foster children wanted to do, bringing friends over to say goodbye, or packing up things around the house that were used by a previous child.",

Quantitative research should also be done to explore potential risk or protective factors that mediate or moderate the relations between moves/removals and foster parent stress or grief, as well as consider the longitudinal impact of multiple moves or removals. For example, does it get easier to process a move or removal or does it contribute to greater increases in stress over time? Essentially, research should more thoroughly consider how moves and removals impact foster parents. Researchers should also conduct evaluation research on available trainings related to grief/loss to assess relevance and effectiveness as this is an underdeveloped area of study (Hebert & Kulkin, 2016).",

For example, research has identified that foster parents report similar levels of compassion fatigue as child welfare workers and those who report higher compassion fatigue also report lower fostering satisfaction and report being more likely to quit fostering (Hannah & Woolgar, 2018). Thus, more substantial preparation for the challenges of fostering and managing of child removals may be helpful. Researchers have also identified that foster parents report only moderate engagement in self-care and this varies by gender, relationship status, health status, and current financial status (Miller, Cooley, Owens, & Fletcher, 2019). One way that agencies can promote self-care is by encouraging and supporting foster parents in exploring other support systems like family, friends, or other foster parents when managing the loss of a foster child.",

Because of the stress and complexity of the child welfare system and the challenge of being a caseworker, this may be particularly difficult (Thompson, Wojciak, & Cooley, 2015). If advanced communication is not possible, child welfare caseworkers may need to provide more consistent and repeated communication about the uncertainty of child cases in a sensitive manner, while also being open and understanding of foster parents\u2019 attachment to their foster children. Although foster parents receive preservice training to help prepare them for fostering and they should understand that the mission of the child welfare system is to return children to their parents, foster parents may need additional reminders and training to understand the importance of reunification, attachment between children and their biological parents, and the benefits of kinship care. Because foster parents may not have the same educational background or professional experiences as caseworkers (e.g., caseworkers function under the goal of reunification, adoption, or concurrent planning while foster parents function as substitute parents with daily attachment-oriented interactions with children), child welfare workers may need to be ready to show higher levels of empathy to foster families coping with a removal of a foster child. It is also important that agencies ensure ongoing access to support groups, counseling, and other appropriate resources for foster families who may struggle with the loss of their foster children.",

Grief or loss over the move or removal of a foster child was a common experience among foster parents in this study, which is congruent with previous research on foster parents. This study also identified that the removal of a foster child impacts not only other members in the household but other family and friends as well. Foster parents manage multiple stressors and responsibilities in their role within the foster care system and may need additional training or support. Agencies will likely need to create a context of openness and support to ensure foster parents\u2019 needs are appropriately met.",
