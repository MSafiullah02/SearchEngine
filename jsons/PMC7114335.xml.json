            "text": "Postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) was first reported in Canada in 1991, in a high health pig herd (Harding, 2004). The disease is characterised by wasting, pallor and occasional jaundice in nursery and fattening pigs (Segales and Domingo, 2002). Morbidity and mortality were 5\u201330% and close to 100%, respectively (Albina et al., 2001). PMWS is now a pig disease of global importance (Allan et al., 2004). PMWS was first reported in Great Britain (GB) in 1999. PMWS has been reproduced by direct contact of healthy pigs with PMWS affected pigs (Albina et al., 2001), indicating that it is an infectious disease. Analyses of patterns of spread of PMWS between farms within Denmark and within GB indicate that it is a new disease, most likely caused by a single infectious agent (Vigre et al., 2005, Woodbine et al., 2007).",

            "text": "Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) was isolated from pigs in Canada with PMWS (Ellis et al., 1998), and was attributed as the aetiological agent causing PMWS (Albina et al., 2001, Krakowka et al., 2001a, Fenaux et al., 2002, Allan et al., 2004). There is now evidence that PCV2 was circulating in pig populations free from PMWS well before PMWS was first reported (Sandvik et al., 2001) and in countries free from PMWS (Pensaert et al., 2001). There is no experiment that consistently fits Koch's postulate that PCV2 demonstrably causes PMWS disease in pigs (Krakowka et al., 2000, Harms et al., 2001, Fenaux et al., 2002, Pensaert et al., 2004). The most reproducible disease occurs when non-infectious immunostimulants or co-infections (e.g. porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus) are given to experimental piglets together with PCV2 (Allan et al., 2000, Allan et al., 2003, Magar et al., 2000, Botner et al., 2001, Krakowka et al., 2000, Krakowka et al., 2001a, Krakowka et al., 2001b, Rovira et al., 2002). Recent research has proposed that only certain genetic variants of PCV2 may cause disease (Opriessnig et al., 2006), but again the evidence for this is not strong.",

The case definition for an infectious disease should apply to individual hosts rather than a population and ideally include a sufficient and necessary cause. The case definition for PMWS is still unresolved. All definitions to date define affected herds, rather than pigs, and include the presence or score of PCV2 antigen. There are six definitions for herd-level PMWS. Sorden (2000) uses enlarged lymph nodes, progressive dyspnoea, diarrhoea, pallor, jaundice and wasting, depletion of lymphoid tissue and high scores of PCV2 virus in a group of up to six pigs. Additions to this definition include a history of raised mortality on affected farms (Rose et al., 2003, Segales et al., 2005; pcvd.org), pigs with characteristic but non-specific signs of sudden wasting and pallor and no other known aetiological agent involved (Woodbine et al., 2007) and farm to farm spread of PMWS (consultative committee for emergency animal diseases Anon, 2005). To date there is no pig definition of PMWS.",

One hundred of these herds were from 500 randomly selected farmers that were contacted by post and who agreed to participate in the study. Their data were held by the British Quality Pigs database that contains virtually all herds with more than 100 breeding sows in England and Wales. Four herds were non-randomly selected from farms in England or Wales that were PMWS negative and 12 were non-randomly selected from farms in Scotland where farmers agreed to participate in the study. The geographical distribution, mean herd size and percent outdoor farms of randomly selected farms were representative of pig farms in GB using DEFRA data on herd size and location (Woodbine et al., 2007).",

Where the number of sick pigs on the farm exceeded three, selection was based on taking a selection of pigs at different stages of disease.

Raised postweaning mortality from an unknown cause was included in the definition of PMWS as it was likely to be reliably recalled because of the impact of PMWS on farm profitability and staff morale. In 2004, PMWS was the one syndrome causing unexplained raised postweaning mortality, so it seems likely that PMWS was the main cause of mortality on these farms. In addition, all but one farmer involved their veterinarian in investigations of raised postweaning mortality, suggesting that it was a real effect. The selection of sick pigs with signs of wasting, pallor and hairiness was used because these are the key clinical signs of PMWS, and were easy to recognise. The selection of healthy pigs from PMWS-affected and -unaffected farms gave two types of control (within and between herd classification of PMWS) that enabled us to investigate PCV2 diagnostic tests in sick and healthy pigs from both PMWS-affected and -unaffected herds. The detection of PCV2 antigen and antibody were deliberately omitted from the study definition of PMWS because of the confusing evidence from published challenge experiments. The definition of affected herds is supported by an analysis of geographical position and time of breakdown, which indicated a space-time clustered epidemic likely to be caused by a single pathogen (Woodbine et al., 2007).",

This was also true for the other herd case definitions for PMWS that were tested, because PCV2 is used in all earlier case definitions of PMWS (Sorden, 2000, Rose et al., 2003).",

They are used clinically to indicate appropriate treatments and interventions, and epidemiologically to generate data that are analysed to improve understanding of the aetiology of disease. Since disease is generated in individuals, the critical causality lies at this level, and so the strongest, most useful case definitions of disease are centred on individuals. Herd level causality is a combination of individual processes plus the population level processes which define the similarity between individuals. In the case of PMWS, it has been easier to define excess postweaning mortality in herds and there are no unique clinical signs in individual pigs, and thus a herd level case definition has arisen.",

This needs refining so that we can accurately define pigs and consequently herds and countries with PMWS. Consequently, we cannot currently (in 2008) accurately define the PMWS-status of individual pigs or herds. We have an incomplete case definition based on postweaning mortality, wasting and pallor in affected pigs and absence of other known pathogens.",

At mid antigen scores there were high antibody titres, possibly containing the virus. However, at high antigen scores the antibody titres were low, indicating insufficient free antibody to contain the virus and that the immune system was overwhelmed. This is similar to that reported in human immunodeficiency virus (Pantophlet et al., 2004) where antigen overwhelms the antibody response.",

The presence of PCV2, even in countries without epidemic PMWS (Jestin et al., 2001, Pensaert et al., 2001, Harding, 2004), and the lack of a robust experimental model with PCV2 alone indicate that presence of >2+ scores of PCV2 antigen as measured with the current test, is not a specific indicator for PMWS in individual pigs, and therefore cannot be used to define PMWS affected herds.",
