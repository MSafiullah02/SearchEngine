Scientists are encouraged to use nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), for real-time detection of DNA and RNA using fluorescent dyes through multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, in which multiple pathogens can be diagnosed in a single run. PCR amplification cannot produce a large amount of high-throughput data, but next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms provide an unbiased-in depth analysis of near-complete genomes. Molecular diagnostic techniques (Microarrays, PCR and NGS) are time saving and precise in the detection and discovery of micro-organisms in a given sample. Development of quantitative, multiplex platforms is imperative for the specific diagnosis of such pathogens, and these platforms can be easily used as point-of-care (POC) molecular diagnostic tools. With automation and miniaturization, microfluidics-based chips can be easily used as a POC platform.

These steps are performed at an isothermal temperature [124] Circle-to-circle amplification, another variant of RCA, detects circular DNA. Mahmoudian et al. 2008 integrated circle-to-circle amplification with a microchip electrophoresis system for the detection of V. cholerae with an LOD of 25 ng of bacteria within 65 min [150, 151] . An exponential linear RCA (with colorimetric detection for pathogenic bacteria, such as E. coli, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Clostridium difficile), was developed with LODs ranging from 10 fM to 100 fM of DNA. In this method, the amplified RCA products are cleaved by nicking endonucleases (Nb.BsrDI). The DNA fragments fold into G-quadruplex structures that form a complex with hemin and become DNAzymes. The DNAzymes undergo oxidation reactions that lead to a colorimetric detection [152] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 227, "end": 232, "text": "[147]", "ref_id": "BIBREF146"}, {"start": 545, "end": 550, "text": "[148,", "ref_id": "BIBREF147"}, {"start": 551, "end": 555, "text": "149]", "ref_id": "BIBREF148"}, {"start": 869, "end": 874, "text": "[124]", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 953, "end": 975, "text": "Mahmoudian et al. 2008", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1138, "end": 1143, "text": "[150,", "ref_id": "BIBREF149"}, {"start": 1144, "end": 1148, "text": "151]", "ref_id": "BIBREF150"}, {"start": 1636, "end": 1641, "text": "[152]", "ref_id": "BIBREF151"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Rolling Circle Amplification"}, {"text": "Notomi et al., developed loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) in 2000 [153] .

The primers and DNA polymerases bind to the DNA template and amplify the template [124] During the initial amplification, the four pairs of primers along with DNA polymerase amplify the DNA, forming a stem loop-like structure. The stem-loop structure becomes the template for cyclic amplification with two additional primer pairs and progresses to elongation and recycling.
