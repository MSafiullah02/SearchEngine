The aim of this study was to investigate respiratory infections in children treated in a hospital intensive care unit (ICU). Assays were performed using the CLART 1 Pneumovir DNA array assay (Genomica, Coslada, Madrid, Spain), which makes it possible to detect 11 genus of respiratory viruses simultaneously. During the winter of 2008-2009, 73 respiratory specimens collected from 53 children under 2 years of age and admitted to an ICU were tested. At least one virus was detected in 78% (57/73) of the samples. The virological diagnosis was based on single infections in 65% (37/57) and on multiple infections in 35% (20/57) of cases. The array assay revealed respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 73.6% (42/57) of the samples and rhinovirus in 24.6% (14/57), either on their own or in coinfections. All viruses identified in single and multiple infections were tested, taking into account clinical features, risk factors, and severity criteria. Children with no risk factors presented more multiple infections, up to 42% of cases, than children with at least one risk factor. RSV seemed to induce severe symptoms by itself as no difference in intubation needs was observed when RSV was detected on its own or in coinfection. The CLART 1 Pneumovir DNA array was useful for examining severe viral respiratory infections, when other viruses than those detected by conventional methods could be involved, particularly in an ICU.

These assays are based on different types of technology, such as ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA 1 ), dual priming oligonucleotide (DPO) technology, targetspecific primer extension (TSPE), or target-specific extension (TSE) [Chun et al., 2007; Mahony et al., 2007; Marshall et al., 2007; Reijans et al., 2008] .

This kit is based on the amplification of specific fragments of the viral genome by means of two multiplex RT-PCR or PCR and a subsequent detection by hybridization with specific binding probes. During the 5-hr RT-PCR/PCR amplification, the amplified products were labeled with biotin. Following amplification, hybridization with specific probes immobilized in sites of the micro-array was performed in a second step lasting 1 hr:30 min. After incubation with a streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate, the addition of tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) induced the appearance of an insoluble product which precipitated at the hybridization sites on the micro-array.",

From a practical point of view, the CLART 1 Pneumovir array assay is easy to use even if technical training is necessary to avoid false positives because of insufficient washing or overexposure of the arrays. Nevertheless, after nucleic acid extraction, the array assay takes 8 hr and is divided into two steps: multiplex RT-PCR followed by hybridization. The main advantages are its high sensitivity and broader detection of respiratory viruses, improving viral diagnosis. However, the detection of multiple infections raises certain questions regarding the pathogenicity of the different viruses. Are all the viruses detected responsible for the clinical signs presented by the patient? These multiple viruses can be successive infections and molecular tests could detect a persistent genome in the absence of virus activity. This array assay is only a qualitative technique. However, quantitation should help to identify the predominant viral agent believed to be responsible for an acute respiratory syndrome. Different studies have described previously the clinical characteristics of multiple viral infections versus RSV single infection. Multiple infections varied from 17.4% to 30% in children under 2 years of age admitted to hospital [Calvo et al., 2008; Miron et al., 2010] and were associated with higher fever, longer hospitalization, and more frequent use of antibiotics than in the case of infection with RSV alone [Calvo et al., 2008] . Infants with multiple infections are at higher risk of being admitted to a pediatric ICU Richard et al., 2008] . In the present study, multiple infections were detected by arrays in 35% of the positive cases. In bronchiolitis, viral co-infection was found in 27.3% of the cases with a predominance of the RSV and hRV co-infection, as described previously . RSV seems to induce severe symptoms on its own. Viral co-infections with RSV effectively did not increase the need for intubation in comparison to infections with RSV as a single agent, as recently reported in a study considering duration of ventilation and length of hospitalization [Marguet et al., 2009] . Interestingly, children admitted to a pediatric ICU with no risk factor were found to present more coinfections than children with risk factors, even if the difference was not significant.",

This prevalence of RSV may be explained by a higher sensitivity of array assay versus RT-PCR, but this point needs to be evaluated in more detail.
