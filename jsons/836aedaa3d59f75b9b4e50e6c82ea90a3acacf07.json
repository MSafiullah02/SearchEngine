            "text": "The corona-virus disease-2019 caused by the novel coronavirus [nCoV] also known as \"SARS-CoV-2\" is a declared pandemic. This is primarily transmitted by the respiratory route [1] . Although WHO noted in 2003 that no cases of SARS-CoV had been reported due to transfusion of blood products, the transfusion transmission risk of this novel virus despite being theoretical, cannot be ignored at this juncture [2] . The outbreak of this nCoV has had a hugely negative impact on the blood community by decreasing the number of donations, thereby, affecting the blood transfusion services [BTS] worldwide [3, 4] . Therefore, all the BTS must assess, plan, and respond in a timely yet proportionate manner towards the upsurge of this devastating nCoV that has killed thousands globally till date. Blood community in these harrowing times must balance the procurement and the issuing of blood in a rather pro-active manner. The global recommendations of \"social distancing\" are being seen as the only effective measure to mitigate the community spread of this deadly pathogen. In the context of BTS, today's mandate to \"flatten the curve of this pandemic\" raises many questions that may transform its basic functioning. Few questions it raises are namely, how can we \"ensure sufficient blood donations\" within the existing limitations of social distancing? How should we protect our BTS staffs who are obligated to work in close proximity to the apparently healthy blood donors? How do we plan the duty-hours of our BTS staff in the wake of this pandemic when fear and anxiety are genuine among the healthcare workers? What could be the short and long-term implications of the reduced collections on our services? The answers to these questions will depend on the extent and time-duration of this pandemic and associated behavioural change, which is anticipated to remain in effect well beyond the original estimates.",

The emergence of COVID-19 has led to an enormous anxiety among blood donors and therefore, the blood community has been affected adversely. Having disrupted so many processes world-wide, the BTS are no exception. Therefore, it merited a compelling and justifiable review of our blood collection, The government's restrictions on conducting VBDCs as a part of the curtailment strategy has directly influenced the blood supply chain. To avoid shortage in these difficult times, in accordance to the national blood transfusion council, we are issuing an appointment letter for the voluntary blood donors, encouraging them to come to our blood centre individually during the lock-down period. Although prepared, till date we have not had any COVID-19 positive patients admitted in our hospital. Therefore, an increase in blood to address specific needs due to either inflammation or DIC [which is shown to happen in such COVID-19",

An experience during the SARS epidemic [2002 to 2003] has shown that the most significant impact on the blood supply during a pandemic is likely to be a dramatic reduction in blood donors [9] . Similarly, a significant 64% drop in the frequency of IH blood donations from pre-pandemic to the full-blown pandemic phase has been observed at our facility.",

It is estimated that demand for red cells will decrease by 5 to 25%, and frozen and fractionated products by 0-10%, with little or no change in platelet demands [10] . In our study, we noted that due to the deferral of elective surgeries and routine procedures during phase-II, there was a reduction in both the demand as well as the issue of blood units. A blood component wise reduction in the demand was 14%, 11% and 1.6% for PRBC, fresh frozen plasma and platelets respectively.

Percentage-wise this reduction in the number of donations amounted to a significant 64%. Of the total 5020 WB collections, 4,772 PRBC units were prepared in the last six-month period [Oct'19 to Mar'20]. The total demand raised for PRBC during these six-months were n=8245. This was reduced to 16% [n=1132/8245] in phase-II when compared to 84% [n=7113/8245] in phase-I respectively[fig.2]. For the estimation of blood requirement, we assessed the number of PRBC units issued on a weekly basis over a period of six months [n=4,164]. The mean number of PRBC units issued on a weekly basis was 148.7 units (Range: 40 to 324) [fig.3]. As shown in fig.2, the issue was high in the month of Oct'19 [n=861",

The increased number of outdated units was due to both a higher number of collections as well as the decreased requirement of blood. The phase-II had lesser number of OBDE units due to lesser collection. The study by Bashwari et al at eastern Saudi Arabia has shown a rate of 3.6% of discarding of blood units due to expiry and the study concludes that performing regular internal audits and reviewing statistics are critical tools of any BTS[6]. The overall discard rate of the South Korean blood services was 3.2% and according to them, the shortened blood reserve in the inventory resulted in the drop in the OBDE rate of the unused blood components[7]. The overall rate of OBDE units during the study period at our blood centre was 30% in phase-I and it was mainly due to the large number of units outdated (458 units in Nov'19 and 424 units in Dec'19) due to lesser requirement of blood bed-side, despite high demand raised during the two occasions. Although our technicians cross-matched and reserved the PRBC units however, the reserved blood was hardly utilized bed-side according to our records. This led to a higher percentage of OBDE on those two occasions. To further analyze the cause for a higher rate of blood wastage due to OBDE, we compared its trend with the pattern of blood collection. Almost 30% [n=1255/4187] of the PRBC units were outdated in phase-I following the higher WB collection. This is strikingly different from phase-II where lesser",
